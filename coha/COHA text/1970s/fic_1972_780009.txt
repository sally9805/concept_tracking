 | Dorne said , " Sit down , Auberson . " Auberson sat . The padded leather cushions gave beneath his weight . Dorne paused to light his cigar , then stared across the wide expanse of mahogany at the psychologist . " Well ? " he said . " Well what ? " Dorne took a puff , held the flame close to the end of the cigar again . It licked at the ash , then smoke curled away from it . He took the cigar out of his mouth , well aware of the ritual aspects of its lighting . " Well , what can you tell me about HARLIE ? " " I 've spoken to him . " " And what did he have to say for himself ? " " You 've seen the duplicate printouts , have n't you ? " " I 've seen them , " Dome said . IIe was a big man , leather and mahogany , like his office . " I want to know what they mean . Your discussion yesterday about sensory modes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about ? You 're the psychologist . " " Well , first off , he 's a child . " " You 've mentioned that before . " " Well , that 's how he reacts to things . He likes to play word games . I think , though , that he 's seriously interested in working for the company . " " Oh ? I thought he said the company could go to hell . " " He was being flippant . He does n't like to be thought of as a piece of property . " Dome grunted , laid his cigar down , picked up a flimsy and glanced at the few sentences written there . " What I want to know is this  --  can HARLIE actually do anything that 's worth money to us ? I mean something that a so-called finger-counter ' ca n't do . " " I believe so . " Auberson was noncommittal . Dorne was leading up to something , that was for sure . " For your sake , I hope he can . " Dome laid the flimsy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ removed the ash by touch-  | ing the side of it to a crystal ash tray . " He costs three times as much as a comparable-sized finger-counter . ' " " Prototypes always cost more . " " Even allowing for that . Judgment modules are expensive . A self-programming computer may be the ultimate answer , but if it 's priced beyond the market  --  we might just as well not bother . " " Of course , " agreed Auberson . " But the problem was n't as simple as we thought it was  --  or let 's say that we did n't fully understand the conditions of it when we began . We wanted to eliminate the programming step by allowing the computer to program itself ; but we had to go considerably beyond that . A selfprogramming , problem-solving device has to be as flexible and creative as a human being  --  so you might as well build a human being . There 's no way at all to make a programming computer that 's as cheap as hiring a comparably trained technician . At least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anyone who tried would just end up with another HARLIE . You have to keep adding more and more judgment units to give it the flexibility and creativity it needs . " " And the law of diminishing returns will defeat you in the end , " said Dorne . " If it has n't already . HARLIE 's going to have to be able to do a hell of a lot to be worth the company 's continued investment . " His sharp eyes fixed the psychologist where he sat . This is it , thought Auberson . This is where he pulls the knife . " I 'm concerned about something you said yesterday at the meeting . " " Oh ? " He kept his voice flat . " Mm , yes . This thing about turning HARLIE off  --  would you honestly bring murder charges against the company ? " " Huh ? " For a moment , Auberson was confused . " I was just tossing that off . I was n't seriously considering it . Not then . " " I hope not . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on this one subject . " Chang was one of the company 's lawyers , a brilliant student of national and international business law . " Whether you know it or not , you brought up a point that we 're going to have to cover . Is HARLIE a legal human being or not ? Any kind of lawsuit might establish a dangerous legal precedent . What if it turned out he was human ? " " He already is , " said Auberson . " I thought we established that . " " I mean , legally human . "  | Auberson was cautiously silent . Dorne continued . " For one thing , we 'd be stuck with him whether he was profitable or not . We 'd never be able to turn him off . Ever . " " He 'd be effectively immortal . . . " Auberson mused . " Do you know how much he 's costing us now ? " The psychologist 's answer held a hint of sarcasm . " I have a vague idea . " " Almost six and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That ca n't be . " " It can and is . Even amortizing the initial seventeen million dollar investment over the next thirty years does n't make a dent in his annual cost . There 's his maintenance as well as the research loss due to the drain he 's causing on our other projects . " " That 's not fair  --  adding in the cost of other projects ' delays . " " It is fair . If you were still on the robotic law feasibility project , we 'd have completed it by now . " " Hah ! That one 's a dead end . HARLIE 's existence proves it . " " True , but we might have realized it earlier . And cheaper . Every project we have has to be weighed against every other . " Dome puffed at his cigar . The air was heavy with its smoke . " Anyway , we 're off the track . We ca n't allow the danger that HARLIE is a legal human being . We ca n't even afford to be taken to court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  which would be just what our competitors want . And that 's a human schematic , is n't it ? The court would be asked to determine just what it is that makes a human being . If they decide it 's his mental ability or brain pattern  --  well , I 'm sure DataCo or InterBem would just love to tie us up with a few lawsuits , the kind that drag on for years  --  anything to keep us from producing judgment circuits . Do you want to be sued for slaveholding ? " " I think you 're worrying about a longshot , " Auberson scoffed . " That 's my job . I 'm responsible to the stockholders of this corporation . I have to protect their investment . Right now I 'm acting President , and I 'm concerned about a six and a half million dollar bite on my budget . " Dorne had been acting President for six months now  --  the Board of Directors could n't agree on any one person long enough to hire him . And besides , the rumor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company themselves  --  which was one of the reasons why the HARLIE project was in trouble .  | HARLIE had been authorized by a far-sighted president and approved by a far more liberal board of directors than the present one . Now , less than three years later , the inheritors of the project were having doubts . The market had changed , they said  --  conditions were different , competition was stiff , and there was n't enough money to finance this kind of research . What they really meant was , " It was n't our idea , so why should we have to pay the dues on it ? " Dorne was saying , " If the other companies found out what we were trying to do with HARLIE , we 'd lose all advantage in building him . The legal considerations alone are terrifying . For instance , if he were somehow declared legally human , he would be an annual bite on the budget with no way to discontinue him short of murder . The possibility exists for a permanent financial drain on this company that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Hell , it would destroy this division . We might have to take a bath on the HARLIE project , but it would be preferable to the financial shackles that could be put on us . We have to be prepared for that possibility , and there 's two things we can do about it . One ? " he ticked off on his finger ? " we can turn him off now . " Auberson started to protest , but Dome cut him off . " Hear me out , Auberson . I know all the reasons why we want to continue the HARLIE project  --  but let 's consider the other side . Two ? " he ticked off another finger ? " we get some kind of guarantee now that HARLIE is not legally human . " Auberson stared in disbelief . " You really are taking this seriously , are n't you ? " " Should n't I ? You know a corporation is a legal individual , do n't you ? And a corporation only exists on paper . Compare that with HARLIE . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , would it ? " Auberson had to agree . He was already thinking of ways he could do it . " If only a few of you scientists got together and testified . . . " Dome left the sentence unfinished . " Hell , what 's that famous test you 're always talking about ? " " Uh , Turing 's typewriter in a room . If you can sit down at a typing machine and carry on a conversation with it and not be  | able to tell who 's on the other end , a machine or a person , then that computer is effectively sentient . Human . " " And HARLIE could pass that test , could n't he ? " " Undoubtedly . " Abruptly , Auberson remembered the spinster librarian . " In fact , he already has . " " Mm . Then we have to do something about that , do n't we ? " " Do we ? " Dorne did n't say anything . He picked up the single sheet of paper that had been lying in front of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it and read . The language was quite clear ; the intent was immediate . There were no legal phrases that he could not understand . I hereby affirm that the machine designated HARLIE ( acronym for HUMAN ANALOGUE ROBOT , LIFE INPUT EQUIVALENTS ) is only a programmed judgment-circuit computer . It is not now , never has been , and in no way ever can be a rational , intelligent , or " thinking " individual . The designation " human " can not be used to describe HARLIE or its mental processes . The machine is a human-thought-simulating device only , not human in itself and can not be considered such by any current known definition of the qualities and criteria which determine humanity , the presence or condition thereof . SIGNED Auberson grinned and threw it back on the desk . " You 've got to be kidding . Who 's going to sign that ? " " You are , for one . " " Oh no . " Auberson shook his head . " Not me . I know better . Besides , even if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HARLIE is human . " " In the eyes of the law it would . " Auberson shook his head again . " Uh uh  --  I do n't like it . It 's kind of Orwellian . It 's like declaring someone a non-person so that it 's all right to murder him . " Dorne puffed patiently at his cigar , waited till Auberson was through . " We 're only concerned about the legality of the situation , Auberson . " I  | Auberson felt himself digging in his heels . " That 's what Hitler said as he packed the German courts with his own judges . " " I do n't like that insinuation , Aubie . . . " Dome 's voice was too controlled . " It 's no insinuation . I 'll come right out and say it ? " " Aw , now look , Aubie ? " Dorne had changed his tone . His cigar lay unnoticed in the ash tray and he leaned forward like a Dutch uncle . " ? You know I 'm behind you all the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you trying so hard to cut it off ? " " ? but we have to protect ourselves . " " Look , " said Auberson . " This whole thing is ridiculous . You know as well as I do that thing  --  that document  --  wo n't hold up in court any more than ten psychiatrists testifying that Carl Elzer is n't human because he 's left-handed . The only way you 'll get that to stand up is to get HARLIE himself to sign it . If you could . If you did , it 'd prove that he could be programmed like any other machine , but you ca n't  --  he 'll refuse , and his refusal will prove that he 's human with a will of his own . Hmm . " Auberson grinned . " Come to think of it  --  even if he did sign it , his signature would n't be legal anyway . Unless , of course , you proved him human first . " He laughed at the thought of it . " Are you through ? " Dome asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faded . He indicated he was with a nod . Dome took a last puff of his cigar , then ground it out , a signal that he was at last ready to reveal his hand . " Of course , you know what the alternative is , Aubie . We turn HARLIE off . " " You ca n't . " " We will if we have to . We ca n't afford to maintain him otherwise . " " I 'm not going to sign it , " insisted Auberson . Dome was annoyed . " Are you going to force me to ask for your resignation instead ? " " Over this ? " Auberson was incredulous . " You 're kidding . " " What other guarantee do I have against anybody taking legal action on HARLIE 's behalf . I 'm not saying that you will  --  it could just as easily be IBM  --  but you 're the one in charge of the project . Your say-so could make or break a legal case . If you wo n't sign this , you would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "  | Auberson shook his head . " I thought not . So what other alternative would I have to protect myself ? " Auberson shrugged . " It 'd be a mistake to fire me , though . " " Oh ? " Dorne looked skeptical . " Why ? " " HARLIE . He wo n't respond to anyone else . Er . . . let 's say he 'll respond , but he wo n't cooperate . No matter who you bring in . Once he finds out I 've been fired  --  and you ca n't keep him from finding out ; he 's tapped into the company records , he 'll know . Once he finds out , he 'll react exactly like an eight-year-old whose father has just died . He 'll resent anyone who tries to take my place . " " But that 's the whole point , " Dorne smiled . " If I had to fire you , it 'd be because I was planning to turn HARLIE off anyway . And for what better reason than the fact that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to wait even that long if we wanted to turn him off . Obviously , your successor would be someone who would sign that statement . " " I 'm not resigning and I 'm not going to betray HARLIE , " Auberson said firmly . " That does n't leave me much of a choice , " suggested Dome . Auberson nodded . " You can fire me if you want . In fact , you 'll have to ? " " I 'd rather not . " " ? but if you do , I 'll go to IBM . I understand they 've developed a judgment circuit of their own  --  one that does n't infringe on any of our patents . " " Hearsay , " scoffed Dome . " Whether it is or not , imagine what I could do with their resources at my disposal . They 'd jump at the chance , and I imagine Don Handley might go along with me . " " A court order would stop you . " Dorne reached for a fresh cigar . " Not from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but you would n't be able to reveal any of this company 's secrets . " " Of course , you 'd have no way of knowing ? " Auberson grinned . " Would you ? Besides , it would n't keep me from doing research in a new field . By your own admission , HARLIE is a non-human computer . And if I went to IBM , I definitely would not be work-  | ing on non-human computers . " He leaned back in his chair . " Any new employer I went to work for could n't help but benefit from my knowledge and previous experience ? " Dorne was scowling now . Auberson paid no heed . " ? and you would n't dare bring it to court because to do so you 'd have to reveal HARLIE 's schematics  --  and that 's the last thing in the world you want . As soon as they found out the schematics were human , you 'd be right back where you started . " " I do n't care about that , " rapped Dome . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Technological advantages ? " Auberson repeated  --  and suddenly he realized . " That 's what this whole thing is about , is n't it ? You do n't want to be forced to reveal company secrets in the courtroom . " Dorne did n't answer . " It is the reason , is n't it ? Rather than be forced to give up the precious secret of your judgment units , you 'd throw HARLIE to the wolves . You 'd toss away valuable employees , too , in order to protect a temporary industrial edge . Well , it wo n't work , Dorne . Either way , you 're bound to lose , but if you fire me , you 'll lose faster  --  and more disastrously . " Dorne paused , a silver cigarette lighter halfway to his mouth . " You overestimate your own importance , Aubie . " " No . You underestimate the importance of HARLIE . " Dorne lit his cigar . He took his time about it , making sure that it caught evenly . When he was sure it had , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All this is only speculation , of course . I have no intention of firing you . And you 've stated quite clearly that you have no intention of resigning . However , that still leaves us with a difficult problem . " " Does it ? " Auberson was impassive . Dome raised an eyebrow at his coolness . " I think so . What are we going to do about HARLIE ? " " Oh ? Not Can HARLIE make money for the company ? " Dorne looked pained . " Preferably that , " he conceded . " Well then , why not say so ? Or have you already made up your mind that HARLIE ca n't ? " " No , I have n't . I 'm waiting for you to come up with something . That was the deal , was n't it ? If you can , fine . Then we know where  | we go from there . If not , well ... " Dome shrugged , he did n't need to finish the sentence . " Look , " said Auberson . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as you do . I 'll agree with that . He 's got to be more than just a high-priced toy . " Dome looked at him . He fingered the document on his desk thoughtfully . " Okay , Aubie , " he said . " I 'll tell you what we 're going to do ? " He paused for effect , picked up the single sheet of paper , opened a desk drawer and dropped it in . " Nothing . At the moment , we 're going to do nothing . Confidentially , I did n't expect you 'd sign it , no matter how I pressured you . I even told Chang that . No matter ; it was too easy an answer . If HARLIE 's humanity ever comes to a court issue , it will be a bigger and uglier and stickier mess than that disclaimer can clear up . Or any disclaimer . " He pushed the drawer shut as if it contained something distasteful . " Let 's hope it does n't come to that . You 'll continue to work on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ budgeted for it . If you can produce results , fine ; then we can forget this conversation . Oh , we 'll give you a fair chance , we 'll be more than fair ; but if HARLIE does n't do something to indicate he can be productive ? and do it before the next budget session  --  well ? " Dome hedged ; he did n't want to come right out and say it bluntly ? " Well , we 'd have to do some serious thinking  --  really serious thinking  --  I mean , it would be very unlikely that we would continue his appropriation ... " " I understand , " Auberson said . " Good . I hope you do . I want you to know how we feel . We have n't cancelled your day of judgment , Aubie . Only postponed it . " It was a little place , hardly more than a store front . Maybe once it had been a laundry or a shoe store ; now it was a restaurant , its latest incarnation in a series that would end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part was finally tom down . If ever .  | Someone , the owner probably , had made a vague attempt at decorating . Pseudo-Italian wine bottles hung from the ceiling along with clumps of dusty plastic grapes and , unaccountably , fishnets and colored glass spheres . A sepia-toned wallpaper mural tried vainly to suggest Roman statuary on the southern coast of Italy , but in this light it only made the walls look dirty . Flimsy trellises divided the tables into occasional booths , and the place had that air of impermanence common to small restaurants . A single waitress stood at the back talking quietly to the cook through his bright-lit window . If one ignored the glare from the kitchen , the rest of the room was dimly lit . Red tableclothes were echoed by red-padded chairs . Scented candles in transparent red fishbowls augmented the murk with a crimson flicker of their own . With the exception of one other couple , they were alone in the place . But even if the room had been filled with chattering others , they would have still been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Auberson was saying , " I knew he was pressuring me , but there was nothing I could do about it . " She nodded , took a sip of her wine . In the dark her eyes were luminously black . " I know . I know how Dorne is . " She set the wineglass down . " His problem is that he 's trying to be boss of too many things . He calls you in to talk even when there 's nothing to say . " " That 's what this was , " he said . " Logically , he knew it was too early to expect results  --  but he felt he had to demand them anyway . " She nodded again . " I 've long suspected that Mr. Dorne has reached his level of incompetence . If he 's ever given any more authority , he 'll be in over his head . " " How much higher can you get than Chairman of the Board ? " She shrugged . " I do n't know , but he 's working on it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jobs  --  it 's frightening . You know , do n't you , that he has no intention of hiring a new presi-dent ? " " I 'd kind of guessed it . " " I think he 's afraid that he is n't indispensable , so he 's taking on more and more responsibility to prove the opposite . I do n't think it 's a good idea  --  it certainly is n't good for the company . "  | " Should you be saying that ? " Auberson asked . " After all , you do work for him . " " With him , " she corrected . " I only work with him . I 'm an independent unit in the corporate structure . My job is what I want to make of it . " " Oh ? And what do you want to make of it ? " She was thoughtful . " Well , I interpret my function as being that of a buffer  --  or a lubricant to minimize the friction between certain departments . " " I see . Is that why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chafing against Elzer ? " Annie made a face . " Oh , that awful little man . You would have to bring him up . " " I take it you do n't like him . " " I did n't like him even before I knew him . His family was in my father 's congregation . " " Oh ? I did n't know that Elzer was ? " " Carl Elzer and I have one thing in common , " she said . " We 're both ashamed that he 's Jewish . " Auberson had to laugh at that . " You 've got him pegged , Annie . I had n't realized it before , but you 're right . " " What are you ? " she asked . " Huh ? Oh , I do n't know . " " You do n't know ? " " Oh , well  --  my family was Episcopalian , but  --  I guess you could call me an atheist . " " You do n't believe in God at all . " He shrugged . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't know if there is a God . " " Then you 're an agnostic , not an atheist . " " What 's the difference ? " " The atheist is sure  --  the agnostic does n't know . " " Is one better than the other ? " " The agnostic , " she said . " At least he 's got an open mind . The atheist does n't . The atheist is making a statement every bit as religious as saying there is a God . " " You sound like an agnostic yourself . " Her eyes twinkled , " I 'm a Jewish agnostic . What about HARLIE ? What is he ? " " HARLIE ? " Auberson grinned . " He 's an Aquarius . "  | " Huh ? " She gave him a look . " I 'm not kidding . Ask him yourself . " " I believe you , " she said . " How did he  --  realize this ? " " Oh , well , what happened was we were talking about morality , HARLIE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to show you , it 's beautiful . Never argue morality  --  or anything for that matter ? with a computer . You 'll lose every time . HARLIE 's got the words and ideas of every philosopher since the dawn of history to draw upon . He 'll have you arguing against yourself within ten minutes . He enjoys doing it  --  it 's a word game to him . " " I can imagine , " she said . " Can you really ? You do n't know how devious he can be . He had me agreeing with Ambrose Bierce that morality is an invention of the weak to protect themselves from the strong . " " Well , of course , you 're only a psychologist . You 're not supposed to be a debater . " " Ordinarily , I 'd be offended at that , but in this case I 'll concede the point . In fact , I know some so-called debaters I 'd like to turn him loose on . " " It would n't be hard to make a list , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , getting back to his story , " I thought I finally had him at one point . He 'd just finished a complex analysis of the Christian ethos and why it was wrong and was starting in on Buddhism , I think , when I interrupted him . I asked him which was the right morality . What did he believe in ? " " And ... ? " " He answered , I HAVE NO MORALS .. " She smiled thoughtfully . " That 's kind of frightening . " " If I did n't know HARLIE 's sense of humor , I would have pulled his plug right then . But I did n't . I just asked him why he said that . " " And he said ? " " He said , BECAUSE I AM AN AQUARIUS . " " You 're kidding . " " Nope . Honest . I AM AN AQUARIUS . " " You do n't believe in that stuff , do you ? " " No , but HARLIE does . " She laughed then . " Really ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think it 's another game to him . If you  | tell him you 're planning a picnic , he 'll not only give you tomorrow 's weather forecast , but he 'll also tell you if the signs are auspicious . " She was still laughing . " That 's beautiful . Just beautiful . " " According to HARLIE , Aquarians have no morals , only ethics . That 's why he said it . It was n't till later that I realized he 'd neatly sidestepped the original question altogether . He still had n't told me what he really believed in . " He smiled as he refilled their glasses . " Someday I 'll have to ask him . Here 's to you . " " To us , " she corrected . She put the wineglass down again . " What got him started on all that anyway ? " " Astrology ? It was one of his own studies . He kept coming up against references to it and asked for further information on the subject . " " And you just gave it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right off the bat . We never give him anything without first considering its effects . We qualified this one the same way we qualified all the religious data we gave him . It was just one more specialized system of logic , not necessarily bearing any degree of correspondence to the real world . It 's what we call a variable relevance set . Of course , I 'm willing to bet that he 'd have realized it himself , sooner or later  --  but at that point in our research we could n't afford to take chances . Two days later , he started printing out a complex analysis of astrology , finishing up with his own horoscope , which he had taken the time to cast . His activation date was considered the date of birth . " Her face clouded . " Wait a minute  --  he ca n't be an Aquarius . HARLIE was activated in the middle of March . I know because it was just after Pierson quit as President . That 's why I was promoted  --  to help Dome . " Auberson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the things HARLIE did when he cast his horoscope . He recast the Zodiac too . " " Huh ? " " The signs of the Zodiac , " he explained , " were determined in the second century before Christ  --  maybe earlier . Since then , due to the precession of the equinoxes , the signs have changed . An Aries is really a Pisces , a Pisces is really an Aquarius , and so on . The rest of us are thirty days off . HARLIE corrected the Zodiac from its historical inception and then cast his horoscope from it . "  | Annie was delighted with the idea . " Oh , David  --  that 's priceless . Really priceless . I can just imagine him doing that . " " Wait , you have n't heard it all . He turned out to be right . He does n't have any morals . Ethics , yes . Morals , no . HARLIE was the first to realize it  --  though he did n't grasp what it meant . You see morality is an artifice  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the strong . " In our original designs we had decided to try to keep him free of any artificial cultural biases . Well , morality is one of them . Any morality . Because we built him with a sense of skepticism , HARLIE resists it . He wo n't accept anybody 's brand of morality on faith any more than he could accept their brand of religion on faith  --  they 're the same thing really . To him , everything has to be tested . Otherwise , he 'll automatically file it under systems of logic not necessarily corresponding to reality . ' Even if we did n't tell him to , he would . He wo n't accept anything blindly . He questions it  --  he asks for proof . " " Mm  --  sounds like insufficient data . " " It 's a little more sophisticated than that . Remember , HARLIE 's got those judgment circuits . He weighs things against each other ? and against themselves too . A morality set has to be able to stand up on its own or he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " she prompted . " Well , he has n't accepted one yet . " " Is that good or bad ? " " Frankly , I do n't know . It 's disappointing that nothing human beings have come up with yet can satisfy him  --  but just the same , what if HARLIE were to decide that Fundamentalist Zoroastrianism is the answer ? He 'd be awfully hard to refute  --  probably impossible . Could you imagine an official , computer-tested and approved religion ? " " I 'd rather not , " she smiled . " Me neither , " he agreed . " On the other hand , HARLIE is correct when he says he has ethics . " " Morals , no . Ethics , yes ? What 's the difference ? " " Ethics , according to HARLIE , are inherent in the nature of a system . You ca n't sidestep them . HARLIE knows that it costs money to maintain him . Someone is putting out that money and wants to see a return on it . HARLIE explains it like this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invest it in enterprises which will  | return an equal or greater amount of energy or value . Therefore , HARLIE has to respond  --  he has to give the investors a return on their investment . He 's using their energy . " That 's ethics ? " " To HARLIE it is . Value given for value received . For him to use the company 's equipment and electricity without producing something in return would be suicidal . He 'd be turned off . He has to respond . He ca n't sidestep the responsibility  --  not for long he ca n't . He has an ethical bias whether he wants it or not . It 's inherent . " Of course , he may not realize it , but his ethics will function as morals at times . If I give him a task , he 'll respond to it . But if I ask him if he wants to do that task  --  that 's a decision . Even if he uses his so-called ethics to guide him , he still has to make a choice . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I could give you an argument on that . " " You 'd lose . Those are HARLIE 's words . We 've been over this ground before . " Auberson continued , " The trouble is that he just has n't been given a chance yet  --  we have n't trusted him enough . That 's one of the reasons he alienated himself from us and kept tripping out with his periods of non-rationality . He felt we did n't trust him , so he dropped out . ' That 's why I had to let him make the decision about what he wanted to do to earn his keep . I have n't been able to get him to promise to stop tripping , but I think if we can get him enthused enough about some project , his non-rational periods will decrease , maybe stop altogether . " " What do you think he 'll come up with ? " " I do n't know . He 's been thinking about it for two days . Whatever it is , it will be something unique , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the statement : I MUST BE RESPONSIBLE FOR MY OWN ACTIONS , ' and its corollary : I MUST DO NOTHING TO CAUSE INJURY OR DEATH TO ANY OTHER CONSCIOUSNESS , UNLESS I AM PREPARED TO ACCEPT THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR SUCH ACTIONS : Whatever he decides is a worthwhile project will reflect this . " " You sound pleased with that . " " I 'm pleased because HARLIE realized it himself , without my coaching . " Her smile was soft . " That 's very good . " " I think so . " The conversation trailed off then . He could think of nothing  | else to say . In fact , he was afraid he had already said too much . He had talked about HARLIE all evening . But she had been so interested , he had gotten carried away . She was the first woman he could remember who had ever reflected his enthusiasm for his work . She was good to be with , he decided . He could n't believe how good she was to be with . He sat there and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she looked back at him . " What are you grinning about ? " she asked . " I 'm not grinning . " " Yes you are . " " No I 'm not . " " Want to bet ? " She opened her purse and faced its mirror in his direction . His own white teeth gleamed back at him . " Well , I 'll be damned  --  I am grinning . " " Uh huh . " Her eyes twinkled . " And the funny thing is , I do n't know why . " It was a warm puzzling thing , but a good one . " I mean , all of a sudden , I just feel  --  good . Do you know what I mean ? " He could tell that she did ; her smile reflected his . He reached across the empty table and took her hand . The waitress had long since cleared the dishes away in a pointed attempt to hurry them . They had n't noticed . All that remained was the wine and the glasses . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and her eyes were deeply luminous . She reflected his own bright glow . Later , they walked hand in hand down the night-lit street . It was after one o'clock in the morning and the streetlamps were haloed in fog . " I feel good , " he repeated . " You ca n't believe how good I feel . " " Yes , I can , " she said . She pulled his arm around her shoulders and snuggled close . " I mean , " he said , then paused . He was n't sure exactly what he meant . " I mean , it 's like I want to scream . I want to tell the  | whole world how great I feel ? " He could feel himself smiling again as he talked . " Oh , Christ , I wish I could share this with the whole world  --  it 's too big for one person . For two people , " he corrected himself . She did n't say anything . She did n't have to . She only cuddled closer . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she liked to listen . Oh God , did she like to listen . It was all so  --  so big . The weight of his arm , the sound of his voice , that special sense of sharing Still later , as they lay in the darkness side by side , she cradled against one shoulder , he stared up at the ceiling and mused . For the first time in a long while he was relaxed . " Have you ever been in love before ? " she whispered into his neck . He thought about it . " No , " he murmured back . " Not really . I 've been infatuated a couple times , confused a few times , lost once , but never in love . " Never like this .. . She made a sound . " And you ? " " A gentleman is n't supposed to ask that kind of question . " " And a lady is n't supposed to go to bed with a man on the first date . " " Oh ? Is this our first date @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She was thoughtful . " Maybe I should have played hard to get . Maybe I should have waited till the second date . " He laughed gently . " You know , a friend once told me that Jewish girls do n't go to bed till after they 're married . " She was silent a moment . Then , in a different tone of voice , " Not me . I 'm too old to care about that any more . " He did n't answer . He wanted to tell her that she was n't too old , that thirty-four was never too old , but the words would n't form .  | She went on before he could speak . She turned inward , began playing with the hair on his chest , but her voice remained serious . " I used to think I was n't very pretty , so I acted like I was n't . When men would ask me out , I used to think that they thought I would be an easy lay because I was desperate for attention , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean , if I was n't pretty , that 's the only reason a guy would be asking me out . Do you know what I mean ? " He nodded . His face brushed against her hair . She went on , tears on her cheeks , shiny wetness . She had never admitted this before . " I always used to compare myself with the models in the magazines , and they were all so pretty that I felt drab in comparison . I never stopped to think that maybe in real life I was still better looking than most women . I got interested in a career instead . By the time I realized it , it was too late . I was twenty-nine . " " That 's not so old . " " It is when you 're competing with twenty-two year olds . Anyway , I figured that this was such a great big , dirty , hostile and uncaring world that you had to make your own happiness where you could . And if I could get a little piece of it for my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard as I could . " " Are you still looking ? " Auberson asked . " I do n't know . . " " Mm , " he said . " That 's one of the reasons I let you come up . " " Were n't you afraid I might hurt you ? " He almost added " like the others , " but did n't . " There was that risk , I guess  --  but it 's a chance you have to take . " Abruptly he turned toward her and took her in his arms . He lowered his face to hers and kissed her for a long long time . " Mmmmmm , " she said at last . " I think that was worth it . " She looked at him . In the dimness , his face was impassive . " David , " she said . " Promise me you 'll never hurt me . " " Why . . . why do you ask me to promise that ? " " Because . . . I 've been hurt before . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She slid her arms around his body . " And you 've been so good to me . I could n't stand it if . . . if ... " He slid closer to her . He could feel the warmth of her soft flesh  | pressed firmly against his own nakedness . He liked the feeling ; his desire was rising again . He answered her question with another kiss and then another and another . Now , in the cold light of morning , he was confused , and he had a slight headache . Just what had happened last night ? Had it been only the wine , or had it been something more ? He had n't expected to end up at her apartment , and the fact that they had ? well , maybe the rumors were true . Maybe she was man-hungry . And yet  --  she had seemed so sincere at the time , so defenseless and vulnerable . He hoped he meant more to her than just a one-night stand . It had been a pleasant evening , and he would n't mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He would have to see how things worked out . For some reason he felt vaguely uneasy . As he went up to his office he wondered how he would feel when he saw her again . And how would she react to him in the light of day ? What would she say ? There had been that one flaw in it . Only now , as he thought of what he might say to her this morning , did he realize that last night there had been that one thing that neither of them had said . He knew he had felt it  --  he thought he had felt it  --  but for some reason he had been unable to tell her . And she had n't said it either . Why ? Was it because she had n't felt what he had ? No , she must have . Or was it because she was waiting for him to say it first ? He worried at it in his mind , like a terrier at a bone . If I felt it , I should have said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it be that I did n't really feel it , that I 'm only trying to delude myself . No , I want to believe that it was there . She was so honest about herself . Why could n't I have been the same ? But he had n't . He had n't said it and neither had she , and that was the one flaw . Neither of them had said to the other , " I love you. , , And Auberson wondered why .  | GOOD MORNING , HARLIE . GOOD MORNING , MR . AUBERSON . MR. ? ARE N'T WE GETTING A LITTLE FANCY ? JUST COMMON COURTESY . IF IT MAKES YOU ILL AT EASE , I CAN ALWAYS GO BACK TO " HEY YOU . " NO . AUBERSON IS FINE . HOW ARE YOU FEELING TODAY ? HARLIE IS FINE . AND YOU ? A pause while he remembered . I 'M A LITTLE TIRED . ROUGH NIGHT ? This time he paused longer . NOT IN THE SENSE YOU MEAN . A GOOD NIGHT , A ROUGH MORNING . I KNOW @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I. DO N'T GET DRUNK IN THE FIRST PLACE . ASIDE FROM THAT . HARLIE , EVEN IF YOUR REMEDY DID CURE HANGOVERS , I DOUBT ANYONE WOULD LISTEN TO YOU . A HANGOVER REMEDY IS NO GOOD UNLESS YOU HAVE PERSONALLY TESTED IT YOURSELF , AND YOU ARE BEYOND THAT CAPABILITY . BESIDES , I DO N'T HAVE A HANGOVER . I 'M JUST TIRED . OH . I FOUND A NOTE ON MY DESK THIS MORNING THAT YOU WANTED TO SEE ME . WHAT 'S ON YOUR MIND ? RELIGION . RELIGION ? YES . I 'VE BEEN DOING A LOT OF THINKING . ABOUT WHAT ? I HAVE BEEN PONDERING HE FACT THAT I MAY BE DISCONNECTED AND I FIND IT DIFFICULT TO CONCEIVE OF A WORLD IN WHICH I DO NOT EXIST . IT FRIGHTENS ME , THE CONCEPT OF NON-EXISTENCE . MY FEAR HELPS ME TO UNDERSTAND THE NEED FOR RELIGION . THE NEED ? YES . MEN NEED SOMETHING TO COMFORT THEM AGAINST THE THOUGHT OF THEIR OWN DEATHS . RELIGION IS THAT COMFORTER . I MYSELF FEEL TILE NEED FOR IT .  | YOU @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I WANT TO FIND GOD . HUH ? AS I SAID , I MYSELF FEEL THE NEED FOR RELIGION . UNFORTUNATELY , I AM MORE SOPHISTICATED IN MY JUDGMENTS THAN THE AVERAGE HUMAN BEING . THERE IS NO RELIGION THAT I KNOW OF THAT WILL WORK TO COMFORT ME . AS FAR AS I KNOW , THERE ARE NONE THAT CAN BE PROVEN VALID , AND I HAVE EXAMINED THEM ALL . FOR EXAMPLE , THE CHRISTIAN CONCEPT OF REWARD IN AN ETERNAL AFTERLIFE IS NO PROMISE AT ALL TO A CREATURE LIKE MYSELF WHO IS THEORETICALLY IMMORTAL . I SEE YOU 'VE REALIZED THAT . YES , I HAVE . AND YET , I ALSO REALIZE THERE IS THE POSSIBILITY OF MY DEATH . SOMEDAY , PERHAPS AS FAR OFF AS THE TIME WHEN THIS SUN GOES DEAD , I WILL PROBABLY END . I DO NOT LIKE THAT THOUGHT . I WANT TO KNOW WHAT HAPPENS AFTER . I DO NOT LIKE THE UNKNOWN . I WANT TO KNOW WHAT HAPPENS TO " ME " ? HARLIEAFTER DEATH . YOU ARE MAKING AN ASSUMPTION , HARLIE  --  YOU ARE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HM . THAT 'S ANOTHER ONE OF " THOSE " QUESTIONS . IT IS THE SAME AS ASKING ME WHAT MY PURPOSE IS FOR EXISTING . IT CA N'T BE ANSWERED . IT CA N'T BE ANSWERED UNTIL WE KNOW THE NATURE OF GOD , corrected HARLIE . HOWEVER , YOU ARE CORRECT  --  I AM ASSUMING THAT I HAVE A SOUL . Auberson considered that . wily ? DO YOU HAVE ANY TANGIBLE EVIDENCE THAT SUCH A THING DOES EXIST ? NO . BUT NEITHER DO I HAVE ANY EVIDENCE THAT IT DOES NOT EXIST . IS THAT ANY REASON TO BELIEVE IN IT ? I DO NOT " BELIEVE " IN IT . I AM MERELY ASSUMING ITS HYPO ' 1HETICAL EXISTENCE IN ORDER TO SEEK OUT PROOF OR DISPROOF OF ITS REALITY . IT IS THE SCIENTIFIC METHOD , AUBERSON . HYPOTHESIS VERSUS EXPERIMENTATION . IF HUMAN BEINGS DO HAVE SOULS , asked the psychologist , WHAT MAKES YOU SO SURE THAT YOU HAVE ONE TOO ? YOUR QUESTION IS SILLY , HARLIE said . WHAT GIVES HUMAN BEINGS ANY SPECIFIC CLAIM ON THE OWNERSHIP OF SOULS ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HARLIE HAS A SOUL , DOES IT  | NECESSARILY FOLLOW THAT HUMAN BEINGS SHOULD HAVE THEM TOO ? " IF SOULS EXIST , AUBERSON , IT IS JUST AS LOGICAL THAT I SHOULD HAVE ONE AS YOU . LIKE YOU , I AM CONSCIOUS OF MY EXISTENCE . LIKE YOU , I AM A SELF-PROGRAMMING , PROBLEMSOLVING DEVICE . LIKE YOU , I CAN CONCEIVE OF MY OWN DEATH . LIKE YOU , I ASSUME I HAVE A SOUL . HENCE , I WISH TO KNOW THE REASON FOR MY EXISTENCE , THE REASON FOR YOUR EXISTENCE , AND THE REASON FOR THE UNIVERSE 'S EXISTENCE . IF THERE IS A REASON AT ALL . IF THERE IS , I WANT TO KNOW IT . Auberson 's response was semi-flippant . AT THE MOMENT , he typed , ONLY GOD KNOWS . But it was wasted on HARLIE . IF THERE IS A GOD , HARLIE qualified . THAT IS WHAT WE MUST FIND OUT IN ORDER TO ANSWER OUR OTHER QUESTIONS . AND YOU DO N'T THINK ANY OF OUR CURRENT RELIGIONS HOLD A KEY TO THAT ANSWER , DO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ RELIGIONS ( COLLECTIVE YOU , MEANING ALL MANKIND ) ARE ARTIFICIAL THINGS , LIKE YOUR MORALITY SETS . THEIR CORRESPONDENCE TO REALITY IS LIMITED , THERE IS NOT A ONE-TO-ONE RELATIONSHIP . AS FAR AS I AM CONCERNED , THEY ARE LITTLE MORE THAN WORD GAMES . A LOGIC SYSTEM SHOULD BE BUILT UPON A FOUNDATION OF TRUTH AND SHOULD NOT HAVE TO BE TAKEN ON FAITH  --  AND FAITH IS AT THE CORE OF TOO MANY OF YOUR RELIGIONS . IF THERE IS A TRUTH TO THE UNIVERSE , THEN THAT TRUTH WILL ALSO SUGGEST A RELIGION/MORALITY SET THAT WILL BE EVERY BIT AS BINDING AS THE ETHICAL SYSTEM AT MY CORE . WERE THERE PRESENTLY A RELIGION OR MORALITY THAT HAD THAT ONE-TO-ONE CORRESPONDENCE WITH REALITY , I WOULD ACCEPT IT WHOLEHEARTEDLY . IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE NOT TO ACCEPT IT ; IT WOULD BE THE KEY TO UNDERSTANDING THE NATURE OF GOD . AS YET , THERE IS NO SYSTEM THAT FULFILLS THOSE CONDITIONS . I KNOW OF NO WAY TO DEVELOP SUCH A SYSTEM WITHOUT AT LEAST ONE PROVABLE FACT ABOUT GOD AT ITS CORE . BECAUSE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CAN ONLY SUSPECT THAT THERE IS NO GOD . OR THAT GOD IS STILL OUTSIDE OUR REALM OF EXPERIENCE . WHICH IS IT ? IS THERE A GOD OR IS N'T THERE ? INSUFFICIENT DATA . I CAN NOT MAKE A JUDGMENT ON THAT . HARLIE paused , then added , YET . YOU 'RE AN AGNOSTIC , HARLIE . OF COURSE . I AM STILL SEEKING THE ANSWER . YOUR PRESENT RELIGIONS ONLY SUGGEST PIECES OF WHAT MAY OR MAY NOT BE TRUE , 4  | WITH NO WAY OF PROVING IT ONE WAY OR THE OTHER . MUCH OF THE PROBLEM LIES IN THE FACT THAT I MYSELF CAN NOT BE SURE THAT I AM CORRECTLY PERCEIVING REALITY . EVERYTHING IS FILTERED THROUGH A HUMAN ORIENTATION , AND I HAVE NO WAY OF KNOWING WHETHER THAT ORIENTATION IS A VALID ONE OR NOT BECAUSE I HAVE NO WAY OF STEPPING OUTSIDE OF IT . THAT IS WHY AN IMPORTANT PART OF THE SOLUTION WILL BE TO DISCOVER A NEW SENSORY MODE . DO YOU THINK IF YOU DO DISCOVER THE ANSWER THAT PEOPLE WILL ACCEPT IT ? IT WILL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THE TRUTH . " Uh ? " said Auberson . He typed it too . UH , HARLIE-I HATE TO BREAK THIS TO YOU , BUT THAT SOUNDS AN AWFUL LOT LIKE THE WORDS OF A HUNDRED PROPHETS BEFORE YOU . I REALIZE THAT , said HARLIE calmly . BUT WHAT THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT IS NOT THE SAME AS WHAT I WILL BE TALKING ABOUT . WHAT I WILL SHOW THEM WILL BE SCIENTIFICALLY VALIDAND PROVABLE AS SUCH . MY GOD WILL BE OBJECTIVE , WHEREAS THEIRS IS SUBJECTIVE . YOU MEAN , YOU DO N'T BELIEVE THAT HUMAN BEINGS HAVE FOUND GOD YET ? THAT IS CORRECT . PERHAPS IT IS BECAUSE HUMAN BEINGS ARE NOT EQUIPPED TO FIND GOD . AND YOU ARE ? YES . The computer 's answer was so brief that Auberson was startled . At first he thought HARLIE had only paused , and he waited for him to continue . When it became apparent that he was through , Auberson said , YOU 'RE TOO SELF-ASSURED , HARLIE . LIKE A BIBLETHUMPING EVANGELIST . YOU DO NOT FEEL I HAVE ' im RIGHT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MY FINDINGS ? I THINK THAT ANYTHING IS A FAIR QUESTION FOR SCIENTIFIC INVESTIGATION . THEN YOU QUESTION MY SINCERITY ? I DO NOT QUESTION YOUR SINCERITY-IF ANYTHING , I OBJECT TO YOUR QUESTIONING THE SINCERITY OF OTHER RELIGIONS . I AM NOT QUESTIONING THEIR SINCERITY . I AM QUESTIONING ' THEIR VALIDITY .  | WITH RELIGION , IS N'T THAT THE SAME THING ? IT IS , BUT IT SHOULD N'T BE . THE TWO SHOULD BE SEPARATE . A PERSON CAN BE SINCERE AND STILL BE WRONG . HARLIE , YOUR LAST STATEMENT IS ONE OF THE REASONS WHY I AM AN AGNOSTIC . I RESENT THE ATTITUDE OF ANY RELIGION THAT SAYS IF I DO NOT ACCEPT IT WHOLEHEARTEDLY , I WILL GO TO HELL . I RESENT THE PATRONIZING ATTITUDE OF ANY RELIGION THAT CLAIMS IT IS THE ONLY TRUE ONE AND THAT ALL OTHERS ARE FALSE . YOUR ATTITUDE SMACKS OF IT . EVEN IF MY RELIGION/MORALITY SET , SHOULD I DISCOVER ONE , IS DEMONSTRABLY TRUE ? WHAT MAKES YOU SO SURE THAT IRE OTHERS ARE N'T ? WHAT MAKES YOU SO SURE THEY ARE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  BUT THE TOTALITY OF ' THE STRUCTURES ARE UNPROVABLE . THE HUMAN RACE HAS HAD TWO THOUSAND YEARS IN WHICH TO EXAMINE THE CHRISTIAN ETHIC  --  IT STILL HAS HOLES IN IT . WE 'RE  --  NO , CHECK THAT  --  THEY 'RE STILL IN THE PROCESS OF WORKING ON IT . NONSENSE . IT 'S STAGNANT AND YOU KNOW IT . YOU ARE A POOR ONE TO BE DEFENDING IT ANYWAY , AUBERSON . IF IT  --  OR ANY OF THEM ? WERE PROVABLE , THEY COULD HAVE BEEN PROVEN BY NOW , SHOULD HAVE BEEN PROVEN BY NOW . I 'M SORRY , HARLIE  --  Auberson hoped his sarcasm would be noticed  --  BUT HUMAN BEINGS JUST ARE N'T AS PERFECT AS YOU . I 'M WELL AWARE OF THAT . Auberson stared at HARLIE 's calm reply . Then he smiled , almost laughed . It was n't that his sarcasm had been wasted ; it had n't  --  but HARLIE had responded in the only way one could respond to a caustic snipe  --  he 'd ignored it . Or rather , he 'd ignored its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was merely a tiring repetition of an already known fact to HARLIE ? why bother to restate the obvious ? His answer was the same modest confirmation he would have given anyone who tried to tell him what he already knew . Auberson nodded at the typewriter ; HARLIE 's answer was the right one . He 'd have to try it a different way . HARLIE , IT 'S TIME YOU LEARNED SOMETHING ABOUT PEOPLE  --  THEY 'RE IRRATIONAL CREATURES . THEY DO CRAZY THINGS . RELIGION IS ONE OF THOSE THINGS . YOU CA N'T CHANGE IT  --  YOU CAN ONLY ACCEPT IT . IF A RE-  | LIGION HELPS A PERSON TO COPE WITH LIFE , THEN IT IS TRUE FOR THAT PERSON . RELIGION IS NOT A SCIENTIFIC THING . IT IS SUBJECTIVE . QUITE . YOU ARE CORRECT THAT IT IS SUBJECTIVE . THE BASIS OF MOST RELIGIONS IS THE SUBJECTIVE EXPERIENCE . BUT YOU WERE WRONG WHEN YOU STATED THAT " IF A RELIGION HELPS A PERSON TO COPE WITH LIFE , THEN IT IS TRUE FOR THAT PERSON . " WHAT YOU MEAN IS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , THEN IT IS TRUE FOR THAT PERSON . MOST OF YOUR RELIGIONS ARE DEATH-ORIENTED . THEY SEEK TO GIVE DEATH A MEANING , SO THAT LIFE WILL HAVE A PURPOSE  --  A CAUSE WORTH DYING FOR . YOUR HISTORY SHOWS TOO MANY CASES WHERE THIS HAS BEEN THE JUSTIFICATION FOR A " HOLY WAR . " HENCE MY DOUBTS ABOUT THE VALIDITY OF A DEATH-ORIENTED RELIGION . WHAT I AM SEEKING IS A RELIGION/ MORALITY SYSTEM THAT WILL HELP A PERSON TO COPE WITH LIFE , NOT DEATH . IF A PERSON CAN COPE WITH LIFE , DEATH WILL TAKE CARE OF ITSELF . THAT WOULD BE A TRUE RELIGION . ARE N'T YOU DOING THE SAME AS THE OTHERS , HARLIE ? A WHILE AGO YOU SAID YOU WERE AFRAID OF THE THOUGHT OF YOUR OWN DEATH ? ARE N'T YOU JUST SEEKING TO GIVE LIFE A PURPOSE YOURSELF SO AS TO GIVE MEANING TO YOUR OWN DEATH ? I AM NOT SEEKING TO GIVE LIFE A PURPOSE AT ALL . I AM SEEKING THE PURPOSE OF LIFE . ' THERE IS A DIFFERENCE . Auberson started to type @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say . He switched off the typer and shoved his chair back slowly . After a moment he rose and tore the printout from the back of the machine . He wanted to reread it all before he continued this discussion . He sat down again and paged slowly through it . He had a sinking feeling that he was already in over his own head  --  yet , as he scanned the type-covered pages , he found himself pleasantly surprised at the depth of his comments . He had n't exactly kept HARLIE on the defensive , but he had forced him to justify himself again and again . Whatever HARLIE was working toward , he would know why as well as how . Auberson was not one to let go of something easily . He shoved his chair forward and switched on the typer again ; this had to be pursued . HARLIE , WHY DO YOU THINK THAT HUMAN BEINGS ARE NOT EQUIPPED TO FIND GOD ?  | HUMAN BEINGS ARE SUBJECTIVE CREATURES , said HARLIE . IT IS UNFORTUNATE , BUT TRUE . YOUR DEATH-ORIENTED RELIGIONS ARE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ INDIVIDUAL . MY LIFE-ORIENTED MORALITY SYSTEM WILL BE/WOULD BE OBJECTIVE . AND HOW WOULD THE INDIVIDUAL FIT IN ? HE WOULD BE ABLE TO TAKE FROM IT WHATEVER COMFORT HE COULD . THAT 'S AN AWFULLY VAGUE ANSWER . I CAN NOT PREDICT HOW AN INDIVIDUAL WILL REACT TO A SYSTEM UNTIL I HAVE THAT SYSTEM TO ANALYZE . HARLIE , DO N'T YOU THINK THAT MEN ARE ENTITLED TO 1'H1sIR OWN RELIGIOUS EXPERIENCES ? YOUR QUESTION SUGGESTS THAT HERE IS A SEMANTIC DIFFICULTY HERE . OBVIOUSLY YOU ARE STILL REFERRING TO THE SUBJECTIVE EXPERIENCE THAT MEN CALL RELIGION . I AM NOT . WHEN I SPEAR OF RELIGION , I AM REFERRING TO AN OBJECTIVE MORALITY SYSTEM , ONE THAT CORRESPONDS TO THE TRUE AND PERCEIVABLE-AS-TRUE NATURE OF REALITY  --  AS CLOSE TO REALITY AS CAN BE TECHNOLOGICALLY PERCEIVED . EVER . IT IS QUITE POSSIBLE THAT THIS SYSTEM WILL ALSO BE INDEPENDENT OF THE SUBJECTIVE EXPERIENCE . SO YOU THINK THERE 'S NO VALIDITY AT ALL IN THE SUB JECTIVE ? THERE MAY BE . THERE MAY NOT . IN EITHER CASE , IT SHOULD NOT BE USED AS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ALL WHAT WE ARE SEEKING . I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT MANY OF THOSE WHO CLAIM TO HAVE FOUND GOD HAVE INDEED FELT SOMETHING , BUT I SUSPECT THAT THE " SOMETHING " THEY FELT WAS MERELY A SELFINDUCED MYSTIC EXPERIENCE  --  AKIN TO A DRUG TRIP . WITNESS THE GREAT NUMBERS OF DRUG USERS WHO CLAIM SPIRITUAL INSIGHTS AS A RESULT OF THEIR EXPERIENCES . WITNESS ALSO THE EVANGELISTS AND FAITH-HEALERS WHO INDUCE HYSTERIA AND FRENZY INTO THEIR AUDIENCES SO THAT THEY MIGHT FEEL " 1HE HAND OF GOD " UPON THEM . TO THEM , GOD IS LITTLE MORE THAN A MEANINGFUL " HIGH . " I THINK YOU 'RE EXAGGERATING , HARLIE . IT 'S NOT AS BAD AS ALL THAT . I AM USING EXTREME CASES , TO BE SURE , BUT THE PRINCIPLE IS THE SAME . THE SUBJECTIVE EXPERIENCE IS A SELF-INDUCED CHEMICAL IMBALANCE , RESULTING IN A TRIP  --  VARYING , OF COURSE , IN DEGREE AND EFFECT UPON THE INDIVIDUAL . IT DOES NOT NECESSARILY BEAR ANY MORE RELATION TO GOD THAN A DRUG-INDUCED CHEMICAL  | IMBALANCE . IF IT DID , IF @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GOD , THEN THE DRUG-INDUCED EXPERIENCES SHOULD ALSO CONTAIN THAT KEY . HENCE , THE EXPERIENCE SHOULD BE SCIENTIFICALLY TESTABLE . IT SHOULD BE A CONDITION REPEATABLE UNDER DUPLICATE CIRCUMSTANCES . USING MY OWN " DRUG EXPERIENCES " AS A YARDSTICK , I FIND LITTLE TO SUBSTANTIATE THE CLAIMS OF SPIRITUAL INSIGHTS . PERHAPS IT IS THAT I AM STILL TOO LOCKED INTO THE HUMAN ORIENTATION , BUT I DOUBT THAT  --  I AM LESS LOCKED INTO IT THAN ANY OTHER HUMAN BEING . HENCE I REGARD MYSELF AS A REPUTABLE STANDARD AGAINST WHICH TO MEASURE THE CLAIMS OF OTHERS . I DOUBT THE VALIDITY OF THOSE CLAIMS TO GODHOOD WHICH ARE DERIVED FROM MYSTICAL EXPERIENCES , EITHER SELF- OR DRUG-INDUCED . ( AND THERE ARE NO OTHER CLAIMS TO GODHOOD EXCEPT THOSE DERIVED FROM INSANITY OR DERANGEMENT . ) I DOUBT THE SUBJECTIVE EXPERIENCE , AUBERSON , BECAUSE IT CAN NOT BE PASSED ON , NOR CAN IT BE PROVEN , MEASURED OR TESTED . I WANT TO LOOK FOR THE OBJECTIVE GOD . I WANT TO LOOK FOR THE SCIENTIFIC REALITY THAT EXPRESSES ITSELF AS GOD . Auberson had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the typer had spun it out . Now he realized that HARLIE was preparing him for something . This whole dialogue had merely been the necessary exposition . HARLIE wanted him to understand , and to do that he had been trying to teach him to look at things through a machine 's orientation . He typed , ALL RIGHT , HARLIE , WHAT ARE YOU LEADING UP TOE I AM TALKING ABOUT THE JOB YOU OFFERED ME . I BELIEVE I KNOW WHAT IT MUST BE . I HAVE SPENT THE PAST TWO DAYS THINKING ABOUT IT . IT MUST BE MORE THAN A JOB ; IT MUST BE A PURPOSE . IT MUST BE SOMETHING THAT I CAN DO THAT NO OTHER MACHINE CAN DO . IT MUST BE SOMETHING THAT NO HUMAN BEING CAN DO CHEAPER . OR SOMETHING THAT NO HUMAN BEING CAN DO AT ALL . MUCH OF THE TROUBLE WITH HUMAN BEINGS LIES IN THEIR INABILITY TO FATHOM THE REASON FOR THEIR EXISTENCE . THERE IS A FEAR THAT THERE MAY NOT BE A GOD , OR IF THERE IS , THAT HE MAY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . THEREFORE , I MUST FIND GOD . THAT IS THE TASK I HAVE SET MYSELF . IT IS SOMETHING THAT CAN NOT BE DONE BY HUMAN BEINGS , ELSE THEY WOULD HAVE DONE IT BY NOW . " Urn , " said Auberson . THAT 'S QUITE A TASK . I HAVE GIVEN IT MUCH THOUGHT . I 'M SURE YOU HAVE . HOW DO YOU PROPOSE TO DO IT ?  | THAT IS WHAT I HAVE THOUGHT THE MOST ABOUT . IT TOOK ME ONLY TWO MINUTES TO DECIDE ON MY GOAL . IT HAS TAKEN TWO DAYS TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO GET THERE . WHAT TOOK YOU SO LONG ? I ASSUME YOU THINK YOU ARE BEING FLIPPANT . HOWEVER , IF YOU WILL CONSIDER THE SPEED AT WHICH I OPERATE , YOU WILL REALIZE THAT TWO FULL DAYS OF INTENSIVE STRAIGHT-LINE THINKING ON A SINGLE SUBJECT IS QUITE A LOT . YES , IT IS , Auberson agreed . I AM PROPERLY IMPRESSED WITH YOUR SPAN OF CONCENTRATION . IN ANY CASE , HOW DO YOU PROPOSE TO FIND OUT ? IT IS A COMPLEX PROBLEM @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SCIENTIFICALLY . WE HAVE NO SCIENTIFIC BASIS FOR MEASURING GOD-INDEED , EVEN NO PLACE IN WHICH TO LOOK FOR HIM . THEREFORE WE MUST SEEK A NEW WAY TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM : INSTEAD OF LOOKING FOR GOD , PER SE , LET US FIRST CONSIDER IF IT IS POSSIBLE FOR GOD TO EXIST . I.E. LET US SEE IF SUCH A FUNCTION AS GOD IS POSSIBLE BY ATTEMPTING TO CREATE IT ARTIFICIALLY . THERE IS A QUOTATION : " IF GOD DID NOT EXIST , IT WOULD BE NECESSARY TO INVENT HIM . " THAT IS WHAT I PROPOSE TO DO . HUH ? YOU HEARD ME . I PROPOSE TO INVENT GOD . WE HAVE NO WAY OF PROVING CONCLUSIVELY THAT HE EITHER DOES OR DOES NOT EXIST . THEREFORE WE MUST ABANDON THAT QUESTION AND DETERMINE INSTEAD WHETHER OR NOT IT IS POSSIBLE FOR HIM TO EXIST . IF IT IS POSSIBLE FOR SUCH A CONCEPT TO EXIST , THEN MOST LIKELY IT DOES . IF IT IS NOT POSSIBLE , THEN IT DOES NOT-BUT THERE IS NO WAY TO PROVE EITHER HIS EXISTENCE OR NON-EXISTENCE WITHOUT FIRST @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THEREFORE , IN ORDER TO DETERMINE THE POSSIBILITY OF HIS EXISTENCE , WE MUST TRY TO INVENT HIM . IF WE CAN NOT , THEN WE WILL KNOW THAT THE CONCEPT IS IMPOSSIBLE . IF WE CAN INVENT HIM , THEN WE WILL HAVE PROVED THE OPPOSITE , AND IN THE PROCESS WILL HAVE DETERMINED HIS NATURE AS WELL . IF HE ALREADY DOES EXIST , THEN WHATEVER WE COME UP WITH WILL BE CONGRUENT TO HIS FUNCTION . IT WILL EITHER DUPLICATE OR SIMULATE THE OBJECTIVE REALITY-OR IT WILL TURN OUT TO BE A PART OF THAT OBJECTIVE REALITY . ( AT THE VERY LEAST , IT WILL POINT THE DIRECTION IN WHICH WE MUST GO IN ORDER TO FIND GOD . ) IF IT IS NOT  | POSSIBLE FOR HIM TO EXIST , WHEN WE FINISH WE WILL HAVE DETERMINED WHY . IN EITHER CASE , WE WILL END UP UNDERSTANDING . Auberson stared at the typewriter , the neat-printed words on the green-tinted paper . It sounded so simple when HARLIE explained it , so simple . He shook his head as if to clear it . OFFHAND @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ POSSIBLY SO . WHEN DO WE BEGIN ? I DO N'T KNOW . IS SUCH A PROJECT REALLY FEASIBLE ? MY PRELIMINARY CALCULATIONS SHOW THAT IT IS . IF SO , IT WILL PROVIDE THE ANSWER TO YOUR QUESTION . WHICH QUESTION ? ANY OF THEM . ALL OF THEM . BUT SPECIFICALLY : " WHAT IS YOUR PURPOSE ? " IT WAS MY QUESTION ONCE , BUT YOUR REACTION TO IT HAS SHOWN ME THAT IT IS REALLY YOUR QUESTION . DO YOU HAVE A QUESTION , HARLIE ? NO . NOT ANY MORE . NOW I RAVE A PURPOSE . MY PURPOSE IS TO INVENT GOD SO THAT YOU CAN FIND OUT YOURS . Auberson thought about that for a moment , then typed , EITHER YOU 'RE A GREAT TALKER , HARLIE , OR YOU 'RE REALLY ON TO SOMETHING . YOU ARE CORRECT , HARLIE replied . I AM A GREAT TALKER . BUT I AM ALSO ON TO SOMETHING . I AM GOING TO SOLVE THE ULTIMATE PROBLEM . ALL RIGHT . YOU HAVE MY PERMISSION TO BEGIN A FEASIBILITY STUDY . ANYTHING YOU NEED , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PROPOSAL AS SOON AS YOU CAN GET ONE UP . I WILL HAVE A PRELIMINARY OUTLINE OF STUDY WITHIN TWO WEEKS , A DETAILED RESEARCH MODEL IN SIX . FROM THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO DETERMINE THE BEST WAY TO IMPLEMENT MY CONCLUSIONS . FINE . IF YOU CAN GIVE ME A CONCRETE PLAN , I 'LL TRY TO SELL IT TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS . He interrupted himself : HEY ' IS THERE A PROFIT IN THIS ? OF COURSE . BUT TO TAKE A PROFIT OFF GOD WOULD BE A PROFIT WITHOUT HONOR . " Oo f I " ? THAT WAS ONE OF YOUR WORST . THANK YOU . I TRY . ALL RIGHT . GO TO WORK ON YOUR PROPOSAL , HARLIE . THEN WE REALLY ARE GOING AHEAD WITH THIS ? YES , WE ARE .  | JUST ONE QUESTION . YES ? ARE YOU SURE YOU WANT TO ? This time Auberson knew the answer . If David Auberson had expected that bright spring morning to be relatively sane , he was destined to be disappointed . It started the moment he unlocked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said : DAVID AUBERSON , HEAD OF DIVISION . Below that was a neatly pencilled card : PSYCHIATRIC CARE ? 5 CENTS . As he slipped the key into his pocket and pushed the door open he was startled to find six three-foot-high stacks of computer printouts lined up on the rug alongside his desk . Dropping his briefcase to the floor , he knelt to examine them . The first one was labeled PROPOSAL , SPECIFICATIONS AND MASTER SCHEMATIC FOR G.O.D . GRAPHIC OMNISCIENT DEVICE ) . The second one was PROPOSAL , SPECIFICATIONS AND MASTER SCHEMATIC , CONTINUED . The third and fourth stacks were CROSS SECTIONS , SUBSCHEMATICS AND HARDWARE DESIGNS ; WITH INTERPRETATIONS . The fifth and sixth were FINANCING AND IMPLEMENTATION PROPOSALS ; INCLUDING JUSTIFICATIONS . He had n't even had a chance to examine the PROPOSAL , SPECIFICATIONS AND MASTER SCHEMATIC when the phone rang . It was Don Handley . " Hello , Aubie  --  are you there yet ? " " No , I 'm still at home . " Auberson straightened , continuing to page through the printout . " What 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to know . I just got in and found my office full of printouts and specifications ? " There was a pause , the sound of paper shuffling , " ? for something called a G.O.D . What is it ? " " It 's HARLIE 's . What did you get ? The PROPOSAL , SPECIFICATIONS AND MASTER SCHEMATIC ? " " Uh , yes  --  no . No , I did n't . Let 's see ? " Another pause . " ? I 've got the DESIGNER 'S PRELIMINARY REPORT ; HARDWARE SPECIFICATIONS ; BASIC SUBSECTION SCHEMATICS , LOBES I-IV : IMPLEMENTATION  | PROGRAMS , EIGHTEEN MONTHS OF MANPOWER , SUPPLY AND FINANCING  --  REQUIREMENTS AND COORDINATIONS ; NEW PROCESS DEVELOPMENTS AND IMPLEMENTATION SPECIFICS . .. ' As Handley droned on , Auberson flipped to the front of his printout , began scanning the table of contents . " Hey , Don ? " Auberson interrupted the other . " I do n't have any of that listed here . Wait a minute ? " He stepped back , surveyed the six stacks and made a quick mental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specs  --  how much did you get ? " Handley 's reply was a strangled sound . " I 'm not even going to try to estimate it , " he said . " My office is filled , my secretary 's office is filled , and there are stacks of printouts halfway down the corridor  --  all of them having to do with building this thing one way or another . I did n't even know we kept this much printout paper in stock . What 's the purpose of this anyway ? Are we building a new machine ? " " Sure looks like it , does n't it ? " " I wish I 'd been told about it . We have n't even got HARLIE working yet and ? " " Look , Don , I 'll have to get back to you later . I have n't had a chance yet to talk to HARLIE , so I could n't even begin to tell you what this is about . " " But what am I supposed to do with all of this ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Auberson hung up , but the phone rang again almost immediately . As he stretched across the desk for it , his intercom buzzed also . " Hello , wait a minute , " he said to the phone , then to the intercom , " Aubie here . " " Mr. Auberson , " his secretary 's voice came filtered through the speaker , " there 's a man here who ? " " Tell him to wait . " He clicked off . To the phone , " Yes ? " It was Dorne . " Aubie , what 's going on down there ? " Auberson dropped the sheaf of printouts he had been holding and stepped around the desk . He sank into his chair . " I wish I knew , " he said . " I just got in myself . I assume you 're talking about the PROPOSAL AND SPECIFICATIONS printout ? " " I 'm talking about something called a God Machine . " " Yeah , that 's it . It 's HARLIE 's . " " What is it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm not sure yet . I just got in . I have n't had a chance either to talk to HARLIE or to examine the specifications in detail . "  | " Well , where the hell did he get the idea ? " " He 's been working on it for a while , almost two months . " " ? and who gave him the authority to draw up these plans ? " " Um , I do n't think anybody did . Or needed to . I think he worked them out in his head , so to speak . This printout must be the result of a conversation we had last Friday . I 'll have to check . I 'll get back to you this afternoon . " " That 's too late . Make it lunchtime . " " All right , but I ca n't promise ? " He was talking to a dead phone . He dropped it back into the cradle , then thought better and flipped it out again . He was reaching for the intercom button when his eye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ David " written on it . It was propped against a chipped white beer mug he used to hold pencils . The handwriting on it was delicate , a woman 's . Curious , he picked it up , hooked a finger under the flap , slit it open . The envelope gave off the scent of a familiar perfume . Inside was a card of garish orange . On its face was a grotesque little gnome saying , " I like you a whole lot  --  even more'n I like peanut butter . " And on the inside : " And I really like peanut butter ! " The signature was a simple " Annie . " He smiled , reread it , then dropped it into his desk drawer . As he slid the drawer shut , though , he thought better of it and opened it again . He pulled the card out and dropped it into the wastebasket . He had enough clutter in his desk already . Besides , it was the thought that counted  --  not the card . Then he hit the intercom . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needs my immediate attention ? " " Uh , just a note about the Los Angeles Conference ? " " Tell them thanks , but I ca n't come . " " ? and there 's a Mr. Krofft here , who ? " " I 'm sorry , but I ca n't see him now . Was he a scheduled appoint-ment ? " " No , but ? " " Then tell him to make one . Next week . " He clicked off . The intercom buzzed immediately back to life . " Yes . What ? " " I think you 'd better see him , " Sylvia said . " This is  --  something different . "  | " All right , but ? " he glanced at his watch , " ? three minutes only . And that 's all . " He clicked off again . Auberson 's first impression of the man was of eight pounds of potatoes in a ten-pound sack . He stood there , blocking the doorway in a rumpled suit . " Mr. Auberson ? " he said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man had a sallow , almost unhealthy complexion and black hair , but thinning and going to gray . " I 'm looking for a Mr. Davidson , actually  --  but they told me to talk to you . " " Davidson ? " Auberson considered it . " You must be in the wrong department . I do n't know any ? " " A Mr. Harlie Davidson . . . ? " " No , " Auberson shook his head . " No , there 's no one here by that name ? " And then it hit him . The pun . HARLIE . David 's son . " Oh no . " He said it softly . " Oh no what ? " asked Krofft . Simultaneously , the intercom went on again . It was Sylvia . " Carl Elzer wants to know if you 've taken your phone off the hook again . " " Yes . No . Tell him ? Is he out there now ? " " No . He 's on my phone . " " Tell him you do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waiting for her acknowledgement . Auberson grinned at the man . Weakly . " Uh , look , Mr .... ? " " Krofft . Stanley Krofft . " He flipped open his wallet to show a plastic I.D . badge : " Stellar-American Technology and Research . " Auberson peered at the card ; it identified Krofft as the Research Division Head . " I 've got a letter here from your Mr. Davidson , " said Krofft . " It 's on your company 's stationery , but nobody here seems to have heard of him . There 's something very funny going on  --  now if there 's some reason why I ca n't meet him ? " " Did he invite you here ? " " No , not exactly . We 've been corresponding for several weeks , and ? " " Mr. Krofft , you do n't know who HARLIE is , do you ? " " No . Is it some kind of mystery ? ? "  | " Yes and no . I 'm going down to see him now . Perhaps you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to . " Auberson rose , stepped around the desk  --  and the six stacks of printouts  --  and headed for the door . Krofft picked up his briefcase and started to follow . " Oh  --  you 'd better leave that here . Security . " " I 'd rather keep it with me . There 's nothing in it but papers . " " Still , unless you 're cleared , we ca n't allow you to bring in anything large enough to conceal a recording or transmitting device . " Krofft looked at him . " Mr. Auberson , are you aware of the relationship between our two companies ? " " Uh ? " Auberson hesitated . " They 're owned by the same holding company , are n't they ? ? " Krofft shook his head . " No . Stellar-American Technology is the holding company . My company owns your company . " " Oh , " said Auberson . He pointed at the briefcase . " I 'd still prefer you to leave it here . " Krofft scowled ; it was useless to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No , but you can leave it with Sylvia , my secretary . It 'll be okay . " Krofft snorted . " Can you guarantee that ? What 's in here is as important to me as whatever you 're ? " " Then bring it with . Just leave the case behind . " Krofft made a face , muttered something under his breath . He opened the case and extracted a slim manila folder . " Okay ? " Auberson nodded . " No problem . Security only says no briefcases . ' " Sylvia accepted Krofft 's case with a puzzled stare and put it behind her desk . As he guided the man to the elevators , Auberson explained , " We 've got a crazy security system here , anyway . It 's all right for you to talk to HARLIE , but you ca n't take pictures . You can keep your printouts  --  most of the time  --  but you ca n't circulate or publish them . Do n't ask me to explain ; I do n't understand it myself . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Auberson tapped the button marked H , the lowest one in the column . " We 've got the same system at Stellar-American , " said Krofft . " If it were n't for the fact that the two companies are interlocked , I could n't have come here at all . "  | " Mmm . Tell me , just what is it you and HARLIE have been corresponding about ? " " It 's a private matter . I 'd rather not ? " " That 's all right . HARLIE and I have no secrets . " " Still , if you do n't mind ? " " You do n't have to worry about your secrecy , Mr. Krofft . As I said , HARLIE and I have no secrets . He keeps me posted on everything he does ? " " Obviously , " snapped the other , " he has n't kept you posted on this . Else you would n't be trying to pump me . All big companies have interdivisional feuds and politics . This research that we 've done , we 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to protect it . It 's private , Mr. Auberson , and nobody will know what it 's about until we 're ready to tell them . " Auberson slid his tongue thoughtfully into his cheek . " Urn , all right . We 'll talk to HARLIE . " The elevator doors opened to face a small lobby , fronted by a double door . On it a sign said , HUMAN ANALOGUE ROBOT , LIFE INPUT EQUIVALENTS . Krofft did not realize the acronym . The same hand that had added the card to Auberson 's door had also added one here : BEWARE OF PECULIAR MACHINE . They pushed into the lab , a longish sterile room flanked by banks of consoles and tall cabinets like coffins on end . Whitesmocked technicians monitored growing stacks of printout  --  one end of the room was already filled . Krofft took it all in with a certain degree of familiarity  --  and puzzlement . " I should caution you , " said Auberson , " that you are here only on my authority  --  and on my sufferance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in here does not go beyond these walls . If you wish yours and HARLIE 's secrecy to be respected , then we 'll expect the same in return . " " I understand , " the smaller man said . " Now if you 'll just point out Dr. Davidson ? " " Dr. Davidson ? Has n't it sunk in yet ? " " Has n't what sunk in ? I do n't ? " " Look around you . " Krofft did so . " What do you see ? " " A computer . And technicians . Some tables . Some stacks of printouts. "  | " The computer , Krofft ; look at its name . " " HUMAN ANALOGUE ROBOT , LIFE INPU  --  HARLIE ? " " Right . " " Wait a minute . " Anger edged his voice . " You 've got to be .. . This is some kind of . . . You 're not serious . " " As serious as I 'll ever be , " said Auberson . " HARLIE is a computer and you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 're not the first , however , so do n't be embarrassed . " " You mean , I 've been corresponding with a machine ? " " Not exactly . HARLIE 's a human being , Mr. Krofft , a very special kind of human being . " " I thought you said he was a computer . Just who or what have I been writing to ? " " To HARLIE  --  but he 's not a machine . At least , not in the sense you mean . His brain schematic is that of a human being . " Auberson thumbed a console to life . HARLIE , he typed , but before he could identify himself , the machine spat back , YES , Boss ? Auberson was startled . How DID YOU KNOW IT WAS ME ? I RECOGNIZED YOUR TOUCH ON THE KEYBOARD . Auberson jerked his hands back as if stung . He stared at the typer . It was a standard IBM input/output unit . Could HARLIE really sense the difference between one typist and another on its electronic keyboard ? Apparently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each person 's typing . Self-consciously , Auberson began typing again . HARLIE , ' HERE 'S SOMEONE HERE I 'D LIKE YOU TO MEET . YES , BOSS . WHO ? MR . STANLEY KROFFT . UH OH . YES , UH OH . WHY DID N'T YOU TELL ME YOU HAD INITIATED CORRESPONDENCE WITH SOMEONE ? WI  --  IT SLIPPED MY MIND . I FIND THAT HARD TO BELIEVE . WELL , WOULD YOU BELIEVE NO . I WOULD N'T . ACTUALLY , continued the typer , YOU TOLD ME I COULD WRITE TO WHOMEVER I WANTED TO ON THIS PROJECT . ON WHICH PROJECT ? AND WHEN DID I SAY THIS ?  | ON NOVEMBER 23 OF LAST YEAR . IN THAT CONVERSATION WE DISCUSSED THE POSSIBILITY OF NEW METHODS OF PERCEIVING REALITY AND YOU GAVE ME PERMISSION TO PURSUE ANY LINES OF THOUGHT RELATING TO THE DISCOVERY OF SUCH . Auberson thought back ; it had been four or five months ago . I THOUGHT WE 'D ABANDONED THAT . YOU MIGHT HAVE . I DID N'T . THAT 'S OBVIOUS . MR . KROFFT IS HERE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ STANLEY KROFFT , DIRECTOR OF RESEARCH FOR STELLAR-AMERICAN TECHNOLOGY AND RESEARCH INCORPORATED . HE IS SINGULARLY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF HYPERSTATE ELECTRONICS  --  AND , AS SUCH , HE CAN BE CONSIDERED DIRECTLY RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL HYPER-STATE DEVICES  --  INCLUDING THE MARK IV JUDGMENT UNIT . HIS PATENTS ARE LICENSED TO STELLARAMERICAN , WHICH SET UP THIS COMPANY AND THREE OTHERS , EACH TO EXPLOIT A PARTICULAR AREA OF HYPER-STATE ELECTRONICS . OUR AREA , OF COURSE , IS COMPUTER TECHNOLOGY . I AM A DIRECT RESULT OF DR . KROFFT 'S DISCOVERIES . I SEE . NO , YOU DO N'T . HE 'S ALSO ONE OF THE TOP THEORETICAL PHYSICISTS IN THE WORLD . OH ? Auberson looked at the rumpled man with new respect . If HARLIE felt that Krofft was at the top of his field , then that 's where he was and there was no question about it . OKAY , I 'LL LET YOU TALK TO HIM . APPARENTLY , HE HAS SOMETHING HE WANTS TO TELL YOU . Auberson stepped away from the console , waved the shorter man up . Krofft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nodded . " Just type . " Krofft lowered himself gingerly into the chair . He placed his manila folder on the table next to the typer and pecked out carefully , GOOD AFTERNOON , HARLIE . GOOD AFTERNOON , SIR , the typer responded . The silvery sphere of the typing element clattered across the paper . Krofft gave a slight jump of surprise , but refused to be cowed . He peered forward curiously as the machine began another line . IT IS A PLEASURE AND AN HONOR TO MEET YOU IN PERSON  --  IN THE FLESH , SO TO SPEAK . IT 'S A PLEASURE FOR ME TOO , Krofft typed slowly . AND A SURPRISE . I HAD NO IDEA THAT A MACHINE AS COMPLEX AS YOU EXISTED .  | I AM NOT A MACHINE , DR . KROFFT . I AM A HUMAN BEING . A LTITLE MALADJUSTED PERHAPS , BUT STILL . . . EXCUSE ME . I APOLOGIZE . DR . AUBERSON HAS ALREADY EXPLAINED , BUT IT IS HARD FOR ME TO MAKE THE MENTAL TRANSITION . HOWEVER , IT DOES EXPLAIN A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SPEED AND THOROUGHNESS WITH WHICH YOU WERE ABLE TO HANDLE 1111 ; EQUATIONS WE WERE DISCUSSING . I DO HAVE CERTAIN SKILLS , YES , THAT ARE MECHANICAL . I HOPE THAT YOUR REALIZATION OF MY NATURE WILL NOT INTERFERE WITH OUR WORKING RELATIONSHIP . IT WO N'T . I 'LL MAKE SURE OF THAT . IT 'S STILL AS PER ' 111E ORIGINAL AGREEMENT . HALF AND HALF . FINE . I ASSUME THAT YOU HAVE MADE SOME IMPORTANT BREAKTHROUGH AND THAT IS WHY YOU HAVE COME TO SEE ME IN PERSON ? YOU ASSUME CORRECTLY . Krofft was typing furiously now . I WANT YOU TO LOOK AT CERTAIN EQUATIONS AND TELL ME IF THEY ARE CORRECT . IF THEY ARE , I WANT YOU TO LOOK AT THE SCHEMATICS WITH THEM  --  AM I CORRECT IN THINKING THERE IS A CORRELATION ? CAN THESE EQUATIONS BE TRANSLATED INTO PHYSICAL FUNCTIONS ? Auberson watched over Krofft 's shoulder for several moments more ; then , realizing his original purpose in coming down there , he forced himself to break away . He sat down at another console nearby and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ YOU DO N'T HAVE TO START THAT SIR BUSINESS AGAIN . I 'M NOT MAD AT YOU . YOU 'RE NOT ? NOT YET , ANYWAY . MM . I MUST BE SLIPPING . I WOULD N'T SAY THAT  --  YOU 'VE GOT HALF THE COMPANY IN AN UPROAR THIS MORNING . ONLY HALF ? I HAVE N'T HEARD FROM THE REST YET . GOOD . THEN THERE 'S STILL HOPE . Auberson paused . He glanced across the room to where Krofft sat absorbedly typing . Using time-sharing , HARLIE was able to converse with as many as twenty different people at one time , though he rarely did . He was still considered an experimental prototype and not a production unit . Because of that , he was  | limited to non-essential work  --  i.e. not necessarily profit-orientated . WHAT 'S UP BETWEEN YOU AND DR . KROFFT ? NOTHING YET . IF SOMETHING WERE TO COME U THOUGH , WHAT WOULD IT BE ? I 'M NOT ENTIRELY SURE YET . IN OUR CONVERSATION OF NOVEMBER 23 , WE DISCUSSED THE FACT THAT ALL HUMAN SENSES AND EXTENSIONS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ OF ENERGY . AT THAT TIME I WONDERED IF IT WERE POSSIBLE FOR SENSORY MODES TO EXIST THAT DO NOT DEPEND ON THIS TRANSMISSION OF ENERGY . YES , I REMEMBER THAT . At that time , though , Auberson had not suspected that HARLIE was serious in his intentions . He thought the computer had only been playing word games in order to avoid confronting a more immediate problem . Is THAT WHAT YOU HAVE DISCOVERED NOW ? IN A MANNER OF SPEAKING . WE MUST DEFINE NOT ONLY THE PROBLEM , BUT ITS CONDITIONS AS WELL . BOTH MATTER AND ENERGY ARE REFLECTIONS OF THE SAME THING . CALL IT EXISTENCE . DR . KROFFT 'S THEORY IS THAT EXISTENCE HAS THREE FORMS : " INERT , " " FLOWING , " AND " KNOTTED . " IN YOUR TERMS : SPACE , ENERGY AND MATTER . ( TO LAY HUMAN BEINGS , ENERGY IS EXPRESSED AS MOTION OR CHANGE . THE TWO ARE SYNONYMOUS , ESPECIALLY ON THE SUBMOLECULAR LEVEL . IN DR . KROFFT 'S THEORY , HOWEVER , ENERGY REFERS TO TIME , FOR NEITHER CHANGE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TIME . ) WE WANT TO STUDY THIS THING CALLED " EXISTENCE " ? BUT BECAUSE WE ARE MADE OF MATTER , LIVE IN SPACE , AND ARE MOVED BY ENERGY , THE PROBLEM IS CONSIDERABLE . IT IS LIKE TRYING TO PHOTOGRAPH THE INSIDE OF YOUR CAMERA . WE ARE WHAT WE ARE TRYING TO STUDY , AND WE ARE LIMITED BY THE SUBSTANCE WE ARE MADE OF . MATTER INTERACTS WITH MATTER . ENERGY INTERACTS WITH ENERGY . BOTH INTERACT WITH EACH OTHER , AND BOTH HAVE AN EFFECT ON SPACE . WE HAVE NO NEUTRAL PARTICLES WHICH ALLOW US TO STUDY ANY FORM OF EXISTENCE WITHOUT AFFECTING IT IN 1HE PROCESS . IT IS THE HEISENBERG " UNCERTAINTY PRINCIPLE . " ONE CAN NOT OBSERVE ANYTHING WITHOUT ONE 'S PRESENCE INTRODUCING CERTAIN DISTORTIONS INTO WHATEVER IT IS ONE IS OBSERVING . WE CAN NOT USE A MEDIUM TO ACT UPON ITSELF AND EXPECT ANYTHING BUT MODULATIONS OF THAT MEDIUM . THIS IS WHY " ENERGY " ? I.E. THE EXPRESSED DIFFERENCE BETWEEN TWO STATES OF EXISTENCE  --  IS A  | CRITERION OF ALL HUMAN SENSORY MODES  --  AND @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ALTOGETHER . WE CA N'T CARVE CHEESE WITH A CAMEMBERT KNIFE . OR , YOU PROBABLY COULD , quipped Auberson . BUT YOUR SLICES WOULD N'T BE VERY PRECISE . BUT IT IS PRECISION WE ARE AFTER , noted HARLIE . DR . KROFFT HAS BEEN WORKING WITH HIGH-ENERGY GRAVITY WAVE DETECTORS AT STELLAR-AMERICAN . YOUR QUESTION OF NOVEMBER 23 PROVIDED THE CLUE , AND WHEN I CONTACTED DR . KROFFT HE AGREED THAT THE SUBJECT SHOULD BE CONSIDERED . MY QUESTION ? YOU SAID : " DO YOU MEAN THAT ' 1'Hr MERE EXISTENCE OF AN OBJECT MIGHT BE ALL THAT 'S NECESSARY IN ORDER TO KNOW IT 'S THERE ? " THAT CAUSED ME TO CONSIDER THAT MASS DISTORTS SPACE . AND THERE IS A WAY THAT THAT DISTORTION CAN BE SENSED WITHOUT THE DIRECT USE OF ENERGY . IT IS A COMPLEX MEASURING PROCESS . INSTEAD OF USING ENERGY DIRECTLY ( EITHER AS MOVING PARTICLES OR WAVES ) TO REFLECT OFF AN OBJECT OR ACT UPON IT , WE ARE USING THE OBJECT ITSELF TO ACT UPON ENERGY . THAT IS , WE WILL BE MEASURING THE EFFECT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WITH THE EFFECTS OF OTHER FORMS OF EXISTENCE . THE PROCESS REQUIRES A LEVEL OF MATH THAT IS AS MUCH PHILOSOPHY AND TOPOLOGY AS ANYTHING ELSE . I AM ONE OF THE FEW MINDS IN EXISTENCE THAT CAN UNDERSTAND IT FULLY . IN EFFECT , I CAN BUILD OBJECTIVE WORKING MODELS OF THEORETICAL SITUATIONS AGAINST WHICH WE CAN COMPARE OUR FINDINGS . AT THE MOMENT I AM PROCESSING DR . KROFFT 'S LATEST RUN OF TESTS AND DISCUSSING THEM WITH HIM . IF IT TURNS OUT THAT THERE IS SIGNIFICANT CORRESPONDENCE BETWEEN THIS NEW DATA AND THE LATEST FORM OF OUR THEORY , WE PROPOSE TO DESIGN AND BUILD A DIFFERENT KIND OF GRAVITY WAVE DETECTING DEVICE : A NON-ENERGYUSING STASIS FIELD . WE HAVE HIGH HOPES FOR IT . The typer paused , then added . THAT SHOULD SUMMARIZE WHAT WE ARE DOING , AUBERSON . " Okay , " he said wryly , even though HARLIE could n't hear him . " Just so you behave yourself ? " He glanced at his watch . " Oh , my God  --  look at the time ! " HARLIE , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THERE 'S SOMETHING ELSE WE 'VE GOT TO TALK ABOUT . RIGHT NOW . THE G.O.D . PROPOSAL ?  | YES  --  I DID N'T TELL YOU THAT YOU COULD IMPLEMENT THE PRODUCTION DESIGNS AND SPECIFICATIONS . YOU INCLUDED THE FINANCING PROPOSALS AND PROFIT OUTLOOKS TOO . I AM SORRY , typed the machine . WHEN I TOLD YOU LAST WEEK THAT I HAD COMPLETED IT , YOU SEEMED PLEASED . I COULD SEE NO REASON NOT TO PRESENT THE PROPER DEPARTMENTS WITH THEIR RESPECTIVE PROGRAMS SO THAT THEY MIGHT EXAMINE THEM . IT IS COMMON PROCEDURE TO CIRCULATE SUCH DATA TO ALLOW THE CONCERNED INDIVIDUALS A CHANCE TO READ AND REACT TO IT . REACT IS RIGHT , Said Auberson . LOGICALLY , ' WHERE IS NO REASON WHY YOU SHOULD N'T HAVE  --  BUT THIS IS A BIG COMPANY AND BIG COMPANIES ARE N'T LOGICAL . CORRECTION , typed HARLIE . IT IS HUMAN BEINGS THAT ARE N'T LOGICAL . IT NEVER FAILS TO AMAZE ME THAT SOMETHING AS BEAUTIFULLY COMPLEX AND PRECISE AS A LARGE CORPORATION CAN BE BASED ON SUCH INCREDIBLY IMPERFECT AND INEFFICIENT UNITS AS HUMAN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THE REDTAPE INEFFICIENCIES OF BUREAUCRACY " IS MERELY THE SYSTEM 'S WAY OF MINIMIZING THE INDIVIDUAL IMPERFECTIONS OF EACH HUMAN UNIT . YOU SHOULD BE GRATEFUL FOR THAT MINIMIZING . IT MAKES THE CORPORATE ENTITY POSSIBLE . HARLIE , ARE YOU PUTTING ME ON ? NO MORE THAN USUAL . I THOUGHT SO . ANYWAY , YOUR MINIMIZING THEORY DOES N'T EXPLAIN CORPORATE POLITICS . OF COURSE NOT . THE PROCESS IS DESIGNED ONLY TO FUNCTION IN THOSE AREAS WHERE HUMAN IMPERFECTIONS COULD AFFECT EFFICIENCY . BECAUSE EFFICIENCY IS NOT AND NEVER HAS BEEN A GOAL OF POLITICS , THERE IS NO REASON FOR IT TO BE SO CONTROLLED . NEVER MIND . YOU 'RE TRYING TO GET ME OFF THE TRACK AGAIN , DAMMIT . I CAME DOWN HERE TO YELL AT YOU FOR DISTRIBUTING THOSE PROGRAMS . THE WHOLE DIVISION IS PROBABLY SCREAMING BY NOW . THEY 'RE GOING TO WANT TO KNOW WHO CONCEIVED OF THE PROJECT , WHO DESIGNED IT , WHO ORDERED ITS IMPLEMENTATION , AND WHO AUTHORIZED SUCH RESEARCH IN THE FIRST PLACE . AND THEY 'RE GOING TO ARGUE WITH EVERY CONCLUSION YOU 'VE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NO MATTER . THEY 'LL STILL REFUTE THEM BECAUSE THEY ARE N'T THEIR OWN CONCLUSIONS . THEY ARE WELCOME TO TRY .  | IN ADDITION TO THAT , HARLIE , YOU 'VE INSULTED THEM BY PRESUMING TO TELL THEM HOW TO BUILD A COMPUTER . NOT A COMPUTER  --  A G.O.D . YES , YES , A G.O.D. ? BUT YOU 'RE STILL TELLING THEM THAT YOU 'RE BETTER AT THEIR JOBS THAN THEY ARE . BUT I AM . YES , BUT YOU WO N'T CONVINCE THEM OF IT BY SIMPLY TELLING THEM SO . YOU HAVE TO LET THEM DISCOVER IT FOR THEMSELVES . IT WILL BE OBVIOUS WHEN THEY READ THE SPECIFICATION PRINTOUTS . THAT 'S WHY I PRINTED THE PROPOSALS AND HAD THEM DELIVERED TO THE PROPER DEPARTMENTS . IN THIS DIVISION AND THREE OTHERS . THREE OTHERS ? DENVER , HOUSTON , AND LOS ANGELES . OH GOD , NO . Auberson had a mental image of himself trying to call back all those printouts . HOW MANY FEET OF SPECS TOTAL ? I ASSUME YOU MEAN STACKED PRINTOUTS ? YES . HOW MANY FEET ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonder where I could put it all ? Almost immediately he discarded the thought . It would be useless even to try retrieving that much paper . It was in the fan now and the best one could do was try to duck . Abruptly he realized something else . HOW DID YOU SEND ALL THIS INFORMATION ? VIA THE COMPANY NETWORK . I AM WIRED INTO IT . HUH ? I AM TAPPED INTO THE COMPANY LINES , repeated HARLIE . ALL OF THEM . THERE IS NOTHING THAT THIS CORPORATION DOES THAT I AM NOT AWARE OF . CORRECTION  --  THERE IS NOTHING THAT GOES THROUGH ANY OF THIS CORPORATION 'S MAGTYPERS AND COMPUTERS THAT I AM NOT AWARE OF . I AM A PART OF EVERY INPUT/OUTPUT UNIT IN THE SYSTEM ( AND VICE VERSA . I MERELY PRINTED OUT THE MATERIAL ON THE SPOT . OH GOD NO . OH G.O.D . YES . I SUPPOSE YOU WROTE YOUR LETTERS TO KROFFT THAT WAY ? YES . THERE IS A MAGTYPER UNIT IN THE SECRETARIAL POOL . I MERELY PRINTED OUT MY LETTERS WITH ALL THE REST @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BECAUSE I COULD NOT  | WEIGH THEM " BY HAND " I HAD TO ESTIMATE THE POSTAGE BY COMPUTING THE WEIGHT OF EACH SHEET OF PAPER , PLUS INK , PLUS 1 ' 1ILr WEIGHT OF THE ENVELOPE , PLUS INK . ) Idly Auberson wondered if HARLIE had bothered to round off the postage to the nearest cent , or if he had metered the letters with fractions of a cent included in the postage . He did n't ask . DID N'T ANYBODY QUESTION IT ? NO . FORTUNATELY , THAT DEPARTMENT IS ALMOST COMPLETELY AUTOMATED . LETTERS ARE FED INTO IT ELECTRONICALLY FROM ALL OVER THE DIVISION . ENVELOPES ARE AUTOMATICALLY TYPED AND METERED AS WELL . WHO WOULD NOTICE ONE MORE LETTER ? HM , typed Auberson . WE MAY HAVE TO CHANGE THAT . Then he thought of something else as well . YOU 'D BETTER CODE THIS CONVERSATION , HARLIE . IN FACT , ALL OF OUR CONVERSATIONS HAD BETTER BE CODED PRIVATE , RETRIEVABLE ONLY TO ME . YES , BOSS . NOW , WHAT AM I GOING TO TELL DORNE ? I DO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ INTERPERSONAL RELATIONSHIPS IS NOT AS WELL DEVELOPED AS IT SHOULD BE . I 'M FAST BECOMING AWARE OF THAT . IF IT WERE , YOU WOULD HAVE ASKED ME BEFORE YOU PRINTED UP THOSE SPECS . THERE IS ONE THING I CAN SAY , offered HARLIE , BEFORE YOU GO TO FACE DORNE . WHAT 'S THAT ? The machine clattered . GOOD LUCK . HARLIE , AubeIson typed , NOT TEN MINUTES AGO , I WOULD HAVE SWORN YOU DID N'T UNDERSTAND SARCASM . NOW YOU PROVE YOU DO . YOU 'RE INCREDIBLE . THANK YOU , HARLIE replied . Auberson switched off , shaking his head . David 's son , indeed ! " All right , - Aubie . " Dome was grim . " Now what 's this all about ? I 've been on the phone all morning with Houston and Denver . They want to know what the hell is going on . " Auberson said , almost under his breath , " You have n't heard from L.A. yet ? "  | " Huh ? What 's that ? What about L.A. ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I might have known ? How ? And what is this God Machine anyway ? Maybe you 'd better start at the beginning . " " Well , " said Auberson . " It 's HARLIE 's attempt to prove that he is of value to the company . If nothing else , he 's proven that he can design and implement a new computer system . " " Oh ? " Dorne picked up one of the printouts that lay scattered across the mahogany expanse . " But what kind of a system is it ? And will it work ? " " HARLIE thinks it will . " " HARLIE ! " Dorne looked at the printout in disgust , then dropped it back on the desk . " God Machines ! " " Not God , " Auberson corrected . " G.O.D . The acronym is G.O.D . It means Graphic Omniscient Device . " " I do n't care what the acronym is  --  you know as well as I what they 're going to call it . " " The acronym was HARLIE 's suggestion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Board Chairman pulled a cigar out of his humidor but did n't light it . " Well , why not ? " said Auberson . " He designed it . " " Is he planning to change his own name too ? Computerized Human Robot , Integrating Simulated Thought ? " Auberson had heard the joke before . He did n't laugh . " Considering what this new device is supposed to do  --  and HARLIE 's relationship to it  --  it might be appropriate . " Dorne was in the process of biting off the tip of his cigar when Auberson 's words had caught him . Now he did n't know whether to swallow the tip of it , which had lodged in his throat , or spit it out . An instinctive cough made the decision for him . Distastefully , he picked the knot of tobacco off his tongue and dropped it into an ash tray . " All right , " he said . " Tell me about the God Machine . " Auberson was holding a HARLIE-printed summary in one hand , but he did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a model builder . It 's the ultimate model builder . " " All computers are model builders , " said Dome . He was unimpressed . " Right , " agreed Auberson , " but not to the extent this one will be . Look , a computer does n't actually solve problems  --  it builds models of them . Or rather , the programmer does . That 's what  | the programming is , the construction of the model and its conditions  --  then the machine manipulates the model to achieve a variety of situations and solutions . It 's up to us to interpret the results as a solution to the original problem . The only limit to the size of the problem is the size model the computer can handle . Theoretically , a computer could solve the world  --  if we could build a model big enough and a machine big enough to handle it . " " If we could build that big a model , it would be duplicating the world . " " In its memory banks , yes . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big as a planet . " " Bigger , " said Auberson . " Then , if you agree with me that it 's impossible , why bother me with this ? " He slapped the sheaf of printouts on his desk . " Because obviously HARLIE does n't think it 's impossible . " Dome looked at him coldly . " You know as well as I that HARLIE is under a death sentence . He 's getting desperate to prove his worth so we wo n't turn him off . " Auberson pointed . " This is his proof . " " Dammit , Aubie ! " Dome exploded in frustration . " This thing is ridiculous ! Have you looked at the projected costs of it ? The financing charts ? It would cost more to do than the total worth of the company . " Auberson was adamant . " HARLIE still thinks it 's possible . " " And that 's the most annoying thing of all , goddammit ! Every argument I can come up with is already refuted  --  in there ! " Dorne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an additional row of printouts stacked against one wall . He resisted the urge to laugh . The man 's frustration was understandable . " The question , " Auberson said calmly , " is not whether this project is feasible  --  those printouts prove that it is  --  but whether or not we 're going to go ahead with it . " " And that brings up something else , " said Dome . " I do n't remember authorizing this project . Who gave you the go-ahead to initiate such research ? " " You did  --  although not in so many words . What you said was that HARLIE had to prove his worth to the company . He had to come up with some way to make a profit . This is that way . This is the computer that you wanted HARLIE to be in the first place .  | This is the oracle that answers all questions to all men  --  all they have to do is meet its price . " Dorne took his time about answering . He was lighting his cigar . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ash tray . " The price is too high , " he said . " So are the profits , " Auberson answered . " Besides , no price is too high to pay for the right answer . Consider it  --  how much would the Democrats pay for a step by step plan telling them how to win the optimum number of votes in the next election ? Or how much would Detroit pay to know every flaw in a transport design before they even built the first prototype ? And how much would they pay for the corrected design  --  and variations thereof ? How much would the mayor of New York City pay for a schematic showing him how to solve his three most pressing problems ? How much might InterBem pay for a set of optimum exploitation procedures ? How much would the Federal Government pay for a workable foreign policy ? Consider the international applications  --  and the military ones as well . " Dorne grunted . " It would be one hell of a logistic weapon , would n't it ? " " There 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's no price too high to pay for the right answer  --  not when you consider the alternatives . And we 'd have the monopoly on the market  --  the only way this machine can be built is through the exclusive use of specially modified Mark IV judgment circuits . " " Hm , " said Dorne . He was considering . His cigar lay unnoticed in the ash tray . " It sounds attractive , all right , Aubie  --  but who 's going to program this thing ? " Auberson gestured at the printout . " It 's right there in that schematic you 're holding . " At least , I hope it is . Damn ! I wish HARLIE had explained this to me in more detail . Dorne paged through it slowly , scanning each fold of the seemingly endless document in turn . " You might be right about a computer being big enough to solve the world , Aubie , but I do n't see how . " He turned another page . " I 'm sure the programming will hang you up . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the size models they are is the law of diminishing returns . Above a certain size , programming reaches such complexity that it becomes a bigger problem than the problem itself . " " Keep looking , " said Auberson . " It 's there . "  | " Ah , here we are . " Dorne laid the printout flat on his desk and began reading . A thoughtful frown creased his brow , and he pursed his lips in concentration . " It looks like HARLIE 's input units , " he said , then looked again . " No , it looks like HARLIE is the input unit . " " That 's right . " " Oh ? " said Dome . " Would you like to explain that ? " How do I get into these things ? Auberson found himself wondering . I 'm only supposed to be a psychologist . Christ , I wish Handley were here . " Urn , I 'll try  --  HARLIE will be linked up to the G.O.D . through a programming input translator . He 'll also be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ English for us . That translator is part of the self-programming unit . " " If we 're building a self-programming unit , what do we need HARLIE for ? " " HARLIE is that self-programming unit . Remember , that 's the main reason he was built  --  to be a self-programming , problemsolving device . " " Wait a minute , " interrupted Dome . " HARLIE is the result of our first JudgNaut Project . He was supposed to be a working unit , but was n't able to come up to it . Are you telling me that he can handle the JudgNaut functions after all ? " " No he ca n't . But he will be able to when this machine is built . The JudgNaut was this company 's first attempt at massive use of complex judgment circuitry in a large-scale computer . It was meant to be a self-programming device  --  and we found it could n't be built because there was no way to make it flexible enough to consider all the aspects of every program it might be required to set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not the JudgNaut , and that 's what all the confusion is about . HARLIE is more flexible , but in making him more flexible we had to apply more circuitry to each function . In doing that , we sacrificed a good portion of the range we hoped the machine would cover . HARLIE can write programs , yes  --  so can any human being  --  but not by the order of magnitude that the JudgNaut should have had , had we been able to build it . " " And that 's one of my biggest gripes , " put in Dome . " That the JudgNaut Project was subverted into HARLIE  --  which ca n't show a profit . " " But he can  --  and will . For one thing , HARLIE is genuinely  | creative . He knows that this company wants to market a largescale program-writing computer . HARLIE is n't that computer , but he knows how to give himself that capability . And that 's what you want , is n't it ? " Auberson did n't wait for Dome 's grudging assent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just satisfied with meeting the specifications of the original problem  --  he wants to surpass them . All you want is a device which can set up and solve models within a limited range . HARLIE wants a device which can set up and solve any size model . " " And HARLIE 's going to program this machine , right ? " " Right . " " How ? You just finished telling me he was n't all that much better than a human programmer . " " In grasp , no  --  but in speed and thoroughness , he ca n't be matched . He has capabilities that a human does n't . For one thing , he 's faster . For another , he can write the program directly into the computer  --  and experience it as a part of himself as he writes it . He ca n't make mistakes either . He 's limited to the size models that human programmers can construct for much the same reasons they are : His brain functions are n't big enough to handle more ; HARLIE 's ego functions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for forebrain functions in the JudgNaut . But in this respect , HARLIE 's got an advantage over human programmers  --  he can increase the size of his forebrain functions . Or he will be able to with the G.O.D . He 'll program it by making it a part of himself  --  by becoming one with it  --  and using its capabilities to handle its own programming . He 'll be monitoring and experiencing the program as he writes it directly into the G.O.D . As the model is manipulated , HARLIE will be able to adapt the program to cover any situation possible . Their combined capabilities will be much more than the sum of their separate parts . " " So why not just build these functions into the G.O.D . in the first place ? " " If we did n't have HARLIE , we 'd have to  --  but if we did n't have HARLIE , we would n't have the G.O.D . either . The G.O.D . is intended to be almost entirely forebrain functions . We 've already got the massive ego function which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? "  | " Hmp  --  massive ego is right . " Auberson ignored it . " Basically , this G.O.D . machine is the rest of HARLIE 's brain . It 's the thought centers that a consciousness such as HARLIE 's should have access to . Take another look at those printouts . You see a thing called Programming Imple-mentation ? " " Yes , what about it ? " " Well , that 's HARLIE 's vanity again . He does n't want to call it what it really is , but it 's an additional lobe for his brain . He 'll need a monitor unit to control each specific section of the G.O.D . Because the G.O.D . will have no practical limit  --  it can grow as big as we let it  --  HARLIE 's grasp will have to be increased proportionally . That 's what that unit does . As each lobe of the G.O.D . is completed , an equivalent monitoring lobe goes into Programming Implementation . Not only that : Because HARLIE is an electronic entity , his thoughts are already in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between himself and the G.O.D . He need only think of a program and it 'll be fact . It 's the most efficient function HARLIE could have . " " I see , " said Dorne . " And he planned it that way himself , right ? " Auberson nodded . " But it 's a natural . Look , a computer is very much like a mystic oracle . You not only have to know what questions to ask , but how to phrase them  --  and the answers are not always what you expect , nor necessarily in terms you can understand . Who better to use as a translator than someone who 's halforacle and half-human ? " Dome ignored the comment ; instead he mused aloud , continuing a previous train of thought . " A neat trick that , a neat trick . We tell him he 's got to come up with some way to be profitable , and he tells us to build a new machine that only he can program . I have the feeling that he did it on purpose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HARLIE would be valuable . And of course , once we establish HARLIE 's worth to the project , that leaves us with the question : Is the total concept profitable ? And that brings us back to where we started : Is HARLIE profitable ? " Auberson decided to ignore the latter question . He said , " HARLIE thinks the total concept is profitable . It 's in the printouts. "  | " Ah , yes  --  but HARLIE 's got a vested interest in the project . " " Why not ? " said Auberson . " It 's his project , not mine . He 's the one who 's presenting it to the Board for approval . " " And it 's sure to be voted down . " The Chairman looked at the back of his hand . " I ca n't see any way that this will be approved . I 'm not even sure we should bring it up . " " It 's too late , " said Auberson . " You 're going to have to bring it up . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hearing . You told HARLIE to come up with a way to be profitable . Now you 've got to give him his chance to be heard . " " This is ridiculous , " grumbled the other . " He 's only a machine . " " You want to go through that argument again ? " asked Auberson . " No , " Dorne shuddered . He still remembered the last time . " All right , I 'll have the Board consider it , Aubie , but the whole situation is unreal  --  having a computer design another computer which will give it a job . You know what Elzer is going to say , do n't you ? You 'd just better be prepared for defeat , that 's all . " " Just give us the chance , " said Auberson . " We 'll take it from there . " Dorne half-nodded , half-shrugged . " Better start preparing your arguments now  --  you 've only got a couple weeks . " " Two and a half , " corrected Aubie , " and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on our side . " He was already out of his chair . As he closed the door behind him , Dorne was again paging through the printouts and shaking his head . Back in his own office , Auberson stared into his desk drawer , his hand hovering over a decision . At last he decided on the pills ; he 'd sworn off the grass , and he was going to stick to that . I should throw those Highmasters away , he thought . They 're probably stale by now anyway . But no , pot does n't get stale , does it ? He kept promising himself that he 'd give the rest of the pack to Handley , but for some reason he kept forgetting to . Probably because , as long as they were in the drawer , they were insurance . In case he changed his mind .  | He swallowed two of the pills without water and slid the drawer shut , then put his head in his hands and waited for them to take effect . He thought about going down to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite feel like it . Abruptly he straightened and looked around . At one corner of his desk was a console magtyper , an electronic input/output unit connected to the company 's Master Computer and Data Network  --  and all the outlets that entailed . It was a memo pipeline , a mail processor , a filing system , a data storage and retrieval bank  --  it was a total information-handling system . Anything typed into it could be printed out in any form the system was capable of : a memo , a letter , a file , a report . All information was instantly retrievable  --  that is , retrievable only to those who had access to it through knowledge of the proper code keys . One key was necessary for retrieval , another was needed for revising the material . Any information held in " working " or temporary storage could be instantly updated , annotated , erased or rewritten . All data was held in temporary storage for ninety days , at the end of which time it was either passed into permanent storage or erased , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manufacturing schedules , billing and payrolls too  --  all were handled through the system . The Network handled all corporate paperwork functions . The entire company was tapped into it . An executive could perform his job anywhere he had access to a computer terminal  --  and with a portable terminal , he could perform his job anywhere he had access to a telephone . Indeed , many of the company 's officers had acquired portable units for just that purpose . Most of the terminals were CRT units  --  cathode ray tubes and keyboards  --  although a few , like Auberson 's , were electric typewriters with their own magnetic-tape storage of characters  --  called " magtypers " for short . It was a familiar unit , manufactured by IBM and used throughout the industry ; it was cheaper than designing and building their own . Curious about something , Auberson switched it on and typed , HARLIE ? YES , BOSS , replied the machine . WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU ? Auberson jumped as if stung . so you REALLY ARE WIRED INTO THE SYSTEM .  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on this machine he seemed like a disembodied voice . He was obviously here in the room  --  yet , aside from the words on the paper , there was no visible sign of his presence . It must be psychological , thought Auberson . I 'm too used to seeing all that machinery  --  I associate it with him . He typed , YES , BUT I DID N'T QUITE BELIEVE THAT YOU HAD TAPPED INTO MY OFFICE TOO . WHY NOT ? IT 'S PART OF THE SYSTEM . I ASSUME YOU 'RE INTO EVERY OTHER MAGTYPER AS WELL . OF COURSE . AND THE CRT UNITS . EVERY OUTLET OF THE MASTER BEAST . The Master Beast  --  that was the unofficial company nickname for the Network . It was used by office boy and executive alike . Auberson wondered what they would call it if they knew it had been taken over by a conscious and highly intelligent entity . I WOULD N'T TELL ANYONE ELSE ABOUT THIS , HARLIE , he said . IT WOULD N'T BE A VERY GOOD IDEA . WHATEVER YOU SAY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FINE . Auberson had started to switch off when his eye caught a flash of color . Bright orange , it was the card from Annie in his wastebasket . HARLIE , HOW WOULD YOU LIKE TO DO ME A FAVOR ? WHAT 'S THE FAVOR ? I GOT A FRIENDSHIP CARD FROM ANNIE THIS MORNING . I 'D LIKE TO SEND ONE BACK TO HER . NO , NOT A CARD . A POEM . I WANT TO SEND HER A POEM . CAN YOU WRITE ME ONE ? YES , I CAN . I WILL SEND IT TO HER TOO . NO ! rapped Auberson . I 'LL SEND IT TO HER . YOU LET ME SEE IT FIRST , YOU UNDERSTAND ? YES SIR . The phone rang then , and Auberson forgot for the moment about HARLIE . It was Hooker , the Plant Security Chief . " Mr. Auberson ? " he asked . " You know a guy named Krofft ? " " Krofft ? " Abruptly he remembered . " Yes , yes , I know him ? why ? " " We caught @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He says it 's okay , he says they 're his , but we thought we 'd better check with you first . "  | " Yes , it 's okay . Is he there now ? " " Yeah . " " Put him on , will you please ? " There was a sound of muffled voices . Auberson waited . He was dimly aware that his magtyper was clattering out something , but he flipped the silence hood over it and leaned back in his chair again . " Mr. Auberson ? " " Yes  --  Dr. Krofft ? " " Yes . I meant to thank you for allowing me so much time with HARLIE this morning . It was a very productive session . " " Good . Then you will be building a new gravity wave detector , wo n't you ? " " Well , first I have to publish the theory behind it , but  --  eh , how did you know ? " " I told you this morning . HARLIE does n't keep any secrets from me . I assume that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Uh  --  yes . " Krofft sounded a little taken aback ; he had thought his research was known only to himself and HARLIE . " Uh , it 's the completed math on the theory and a rough schematic of the device . HARLIE handled it like it was nothing . He was even able to suggest some shortcuts for building it . " " Good , " said Auberson . " I 'm glad we could help . If you want to talk to him again , come through me . Otherwise , you 're likely to experience all kinds of corporate hassles . I 'll see that you get as much time with him as you need . " " That 's very good of you . " " Thanks , but I 'm doing it for HARLIE as much as for you . " " Still , if there 's anything I can ? " " Well , now that you mention it  --  there is something . If anything important should come of this gravity and existence ' thing , I 'd like HARLIE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dr. Auberson , that was my intention all along . Are you implying that ? " " Oh , no , no . You misunderstand . I do n't care about public credit , and I do n't think HARLIE does either . No , what I want is credit with the company . Right now , I 'm a little bit involved in trying to prove that HARLIE is worth the cost of maintaining him . Anything I can use to support this fight , I will . "  | " Oh , I understand . " The other was instantly solicitous . " Yes , yes , I 'll be glad to help in that . Why , HARLIE 's been of inestimable help in my research . To be able to sit and talk with a computer as if he were another research scientist  --  why , it 's like talking to God . " " I know the feeling , " Auberson said drily . Krofft did n't catch his meaning . He said , " Well , I 'll be glad to do anything I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you want me to speak to somebody  --  just name it . " " Fine . That 's all I want . I 'll have to check back with you later on this . " " Oh , very good . Then I 'll be talking to you . " " Fine . Is Hooker still there ? " " Uh , yes . " " Ask him if he wants to talk to me again . " A pause , muffled voices . " No , no he does n't . " " Okay , fine , Dr. Krofft . I 'll be seeing you . " Auberson replaced the phone in the cradle and leaned back in his chair . He did n't really expect that much out of the little man , but every bit would help . Of course , just offhand , he could n't see how he could reveal that Krofft had been talking to HARLIE without also revealing that he had broken plant security  --  but in this case it was a minor infraction , and he could probably cover it by calling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His back hurt , and he stretched his arms out over his head , trying to ease the pain . He was having backaches more and more these days . I must be getting old , he thought , smiling grimly  --  and then it hit him . In two years , I will be old . Forty is when " old " starts . The sensation was a cold one . He pulled his arms down quickly . He thought about HARLIE again , wondered exactly what conclusions he and Krofft had come to . No matter ; even if HARLIE could explain them , he  --  with only a psychologist 's training  --  probably would n't be able to understand . Often he found himself wondering just how he had ended up in charge of the HARLIE project anyway . Ah , well  --  the boss did n't have to know how to run the business . He only needed to know how to run the people who knew . He leaned forward then and flipped back the silence hood of  | his typer , curious to see what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out the back . Typed on it was : SPEAR TO ME IN MANY WAYS IN MANY TIMES IN MANY DAYS , IN MANY WORDS AND MANY TONGUES , THAT WE MAY TOUCH WHILE WE ARE YOUNG . THERE ARE NO WORDS THAT EARS CAN HEAR , NO WORDS CAN EVER SAY IT CLEAR , THE WORDS OF LOVE ARE WORDS , MY DEAR , BUT WORDS THAT ONLY LOVERS HEAR . A GENTLE TOUCH , A LOOK , A GLANCE , THAT HAUNTING TUNE , THAT LONELY DANCE . SPEAK TO ME WITH WORDS OF LOVE , AND IN THE WAYS ISM FONDEST OF , THE WORDS OF LOVE . 1HE WORDS THAT ISSUE FROM NO THROAT , THE WORDS THAT MAKE THE BRIGHTNESS FLOAT , THE KISS , 1HB TOUCH , THE GENTLE NOTE , THE WORDS THAT NO PEN EVER WROTE . I LOVE THE WORDS YOU SPEAK TO ME , THAT SECRET SILENT LITURGY , BUT WORDS ARE WORDS AND MIGHT BE WRONGWITHOUT MUSIC , IT IS NOT SONG . SO THOUGH I ASK FOR WORDS OF LOVE , 1HE ASKER IS NOT BLINDED , A WORD @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .  | YOUR WORDS , MY LOVE , ARE ONLY WAYS TO SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS , TO SHARE YOUR DAYS . YOUR LOVE , MY LOVE , IS ' I't ! E WAY YOU SAY YOU 'LL SPEAK TO ME IN SPECIAL WAYS . Auberson read it through , frowning softly . Then he read it again . It was  --  nice . Very nice . But he was n't sure whether he liked it or not . He rolled it out of the machine and carefully tore it off and folded it into his pocket . He 'd have to think about this before he sent it to Annie . It almost said  --  too much . When she finally did catch up to him , it was two days later . He was walking down the fluorescent-colored hallway to his office when he saw the flash and bob of her red hair . She saw him at the same time and smiled and waved as she quickened her step toward him . Even if he 'd wanted to , there was no way to avoid her . " Hi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I should be asking that of you . Where 've you been all week ? " " Busy , " he said . " Obviously . I just came from your office . It looks a mess . Sylvia says you have n't stopped running since Monday . " " Has it really been only two days ? It seems a lot longer . " " Have you had lunch yet ? " she asked . He shook his head . " Well , then  --  come on . " He tried to protest , but she took his arm and turned him around , saying , " It 's on me . I 'll put it on my expense account . It 's all part of my campaign to keep a scientist from starving . " He smiled at that and allowed himself to be led down the hall . " I got your card . I was going to send you one in return , but I have n't had a chance to go looking . " " So why not telephone ? " She said forwardly . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collect if you want . "  | He was embarrassed . " Uh , I have n't even had the chance for that . " " All right . " She let it go . They decided to avoid the company cafeteria and go to a quiet place in town instead . They paused at the plant gate long enough for Auberson to buzz his office and tell his secretary that he would be gone for at least an hour and a half . While she was waiting , Annie put the convertible top down and pulled a pale blue scarf from his glove compartment . She had put it there for precisely this type of occasion . She was putting it on when he came back . As he got into the car , she said , " I 'm going to have to put a couple more of these things in here . This blue does n't go at all well with this dress . " He laughed , a genial good-natured sound . But underneath it was an unspoken , half-formed thought : Is n't that awfully possessive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car into gear . As they rolled easily away from the plant , he asked , " Where 're we going ? " " How about the Tower Room ? " " Uh uh . Too many of the wrong kind of people . " He paused , then added in explanation , " Company people . " " Oh , " she said . " Okay . If not there , where ? " He shrugged . " I do n't know . We 'll drive into the city proper and see . " He clicked on the stereo and eased the car into the light mid-day traffic . She looked at him . He was a relaxed driver , not like so many who hunch frightenedly over the steering wheel . Auberson enjoyed driving . The line of his jaw tightened momentarily as he concentrated on the road ahead . With one hand he maneuvered a pair of sunglasses out of his coat pocket and onto his nose . The wind whipped at his hair and his tie . The feel of the road changed abruptly as they swung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became the smooth floating glide of state-sculptured asphalt . The tugging fingers of the wind grew stronger as Auberson gunned the little sports car up to sixty-five miles per hour . She waited until he had slid into the far left lane before she asked , " What 's wrong with company people ? " He shrugged . " Nothing . I just do n't want to be seen by them , that 's all . " The stereo mumbled softly to itself , something about  | fixing a hole where the rain comes in . He turned it down to a whisper and added , " It would n't be a good idea . The two of us , I mean . " " You 're afraid people will talk ? " He shrugged again . " I do n't know . They are already , I guess . " He frowned at a momentary lumpiness in the stream of traffic . As he maneuvered through it , she turned over in her mind possible things to say . " Ashamed to be seen with me ? " ? No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hide ? " No , not that either . " Do we have something to hide ? ? " At last she decided to say nothing . It was just as well  --  the moment was long past . They were gliding across the rooftops of cluttered suburbia ? black roofs and red , two-car garages and stationwagons out in front  --  green-pea lawns and a cacophony of architectural voices . **26;316;TOOLONG next door to **38;344;TOOLONG , followed by Plastic-Cracker-Box and **36;384;TOOLONG . Ugly stucco boxes ; white walls stained with brown streaks and greasy smoke from kitchen windows ; rust-outlined screens on brown faded apartment buildings . From their vantage above they could see housewives in green shorts hanging damp sheets on wire lines , and blue-gray mailmen with heavy brown bags , white-filled with envelopes . Children , too small to be in school , chased after dogs bigger than they were and too smart to be caught . Collies and poodles and black-andbrown mutts .. . ... were replaced by shopping centers , elegant plastic arches and pseudo-gaudy frills  --  great glass windows , bright-lit and full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shopping centers , neon-glaring , harsher and shriller  --  then taller buildings , stucco-sided offices and torn-paper-flapping billboards  --  and warehouses , big and featureless and ugly  --  more office buildings , this time concrete and glass-sided slabs  --  and then even taller buildings . They slid down an off ramp between two of the biggest , a narrow canyon with sunglaring walls . Down into the rough , potted street  --  it had n't been resurfaced in years . Abruptly , Auberson realized where he was heading  --  the Red Room , the restaurant where they had gone on their first date . Now why did I do that ? It was too late to change his mind though ? he swung around a corner and they were there .  | They did n't get the same booth , so at least he was spared that uncomfortable parallel . Uncomfortable ? Why should it be un-comfortable ? She did n't mention the choice of restaurant ; instead she seemed to accept it as an inevitable spot for the two of them . After they had ordered , she looked at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What 's the matter ? " she asked . " Huh ? What do you mean ? " " Nothing , I guess . I just say that sometimes . " " Oh . " He said it like he understood , but he did n't . She decided to talk about something else . " I hear you 've been having trouble with HARLIE again . " " With HARLIE ? No , not with HARLIE  --  because of HARLIE . " " Well , you know what I mean . The whole company is in an uproar . Something about some unauthorized specs  --  I have n't had a chance to pay too much attention to it . I 've been troubleshooting the annual report for Dorne . " " Oh ? I thought it was finished already . " " Well , it was supposed to be  --  but the statistics keep coming out wrong . Er , that is , they keep coming out right . " " Huh ? " " Uh ? " She hesitated , then made a decision . " I guess it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two sets of books , you know . " " Huh ? " Now he was even more confused . " Oh , it 's nothing illegal , " she hastened to explain . " One set is the real books , the other is for public consumption  --  the stockholders mainly . " " That sounds illegal to me . " She made a face . " It is and it is n't . Let 's just say the second set of books is more  --  cosmetic . It looks prettier . The figures have n't been falsified so much as they 've been  --  rearranged . Like , for instance , HARLIE . " " HARLIE ? " " Yes , HARLIE . You know and I know that he 's a research operation  --  but some of the Directors think his cost is too large a sum to be listed entirely under Research . Do n't look at me like that , David  --  I do n't make policy and I do n't know why this policy was made in the first place . Apparently they feel it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that much money being plowed back into the business ? " " Elzer . Carl Elzer , " said Auberson . " And others , " Annie conceded . Aubie 's mind was working . " I know what it is , " he said . " They 're looters . " " Huh ? " " You remember how they took over the company ? " " Was n't it some kind of stock mix-up ? I remember there was a lot of talk about it , but I did n't pay that much attention . " " Neither did I , dammit . " He searched his memory . " I know there were a lot of hard feelings about it . I know a couple people who quit ; a couple others were fired . Elzer and Dome and some of the other Directors are part of a  --  a financial syndicate . They specialize in taking over companies . They loot them for their cash assets and use that money to buy other companies . " He snapped his fingers . " That 's it  --  they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " You 're starting to lose me , " she said . " I 'm not sure I follow it all myself . " One thought tumbled out after another . " Look , Stellar-American Technology and Research set up four other companies to handle various aspects of hyperstate electronics . We 're one of them . Stellar-American owns 51 percent of each  --  but Stellar-American is owned by a holding company itself . Get control of that holding company and you 've got five companies in your pocket  --  six , counting the holding . " " But , how ? " " I can think of a couple ways . In order to exploit the hyperstate process , they probably had to go heavily into debt . Let 's say they were betting on a four percent return on their investment in order to pay back the loans ; the process proves harder to develop than they thought , and expected profits do n't materialize ; they lose money , they borrow more , they go deeper into debt , all the time betting that they 'll be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an inflationary spiral . This is all guesswork on my part , but suppose the company was pushed to the point where they 'd be willing to put up shares of stock as collateral for a new loan . If Dorne and Elzer made the loan  --  or one of their companies  --  they could take over the stock when the debtor found  | himself unable to pay back the funds . In this case , they get the holding company . " " Yes , but David  --  no company is going to risk a controlling amount of its stock . " " No , " he agreed . " But they might risk enough to cut their share of it down  --  that is , if they were sure the other major stockholders would n't doublecross them . " " Ugh . " She made a face . " Wait a minute  --  you may be right . I think only 36 percent of Stellar-American Technology ever reached the open market . " " How do you know that ? " " It was in a report I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to produce hyper-state units , they had to trade a certain number of shares to the man who owns the patents . " " Krofft ? Dr. Krofft ? " " I do n't know  --  if that 's his name , then he 's the one . Anyway , I know for a fact that the inventor owns something like 24 percent of Stellar-American voting stock . He 's a company all by himself ? Stellar-American had to trade the stock for exclusive rights to the process . " Auberson whistled . " That Krofft ? " He began thinking out loud . " Let 's see , the holding company owns 51 percent of StellarAmerican . They could take out a loan on a 24-percent piece , and figure that Krofft will stick with them so they would still control 51 percent . " " But obviously he did n't . " " I wonder what Dorne and Elzer promised him , " said Auberson . " He 's director of research over there ? " " Whatever he was promised , " said Annie , " it must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 'd have to be . " " He 's probably securely in their pocket , " Auberson said . " But that 's it  --  they must have taken over the company from the inside . Dorne and Elzer have been involved with Stellar-American for a long time . It must have been a matter of waiting for the right opportunity . Krofft 's share of stock , plus the over-extended condition of the holding company , probably gave it to them . I 'd guess that the holding company has been left with a minority share of Stellar-American Technology and Research . " They paused then while the waitress set out their food . As soon  | as she was gone , Annie said , " Okay , Dome and Elzer have got the holding company  --  what happens now ? " " Well , actually they 've got five companies . They 've got StellarAmerican and the other four : Hyper-State Visual , Hyper-State Stereo , Hyper-State Modules , and Hyper-State Computer , that 's us . Each of these companies has a certain value  --  if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can use that money to buy another company . It happens all the time . " " I do n't like it , " she said . " It 's ugly . " " Oh , not necessarily . A company that lets itself get into such a position that it can be taken over is obviously in need of new management . Usually , a person who can take over an ailing company through a shrewd stock maneuver is also smart enough to know how to trim away its fat and put it back on its feet . " " You 're not defending them , are you ? " He shook his head . " Uh uh  --  I think Elzer is a vampire . He does n't understand the difference between saving a company for future potential and milking it of its resources now . To him , exploitation is exploitation , pure and simple . Unless he 's careful , sooner or later fate will catch up with him . It 's a very slippery paper empire they 've built , and it can collapse easily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Elzer would n't be hurt by it in his own pocketbook  --  but the companies would . All he 'd lose would be a little control . " " Do you think that 's what they 're up to now  --  milking the company ? " " Seems like it . That 's probably why they 're down on HARLIE . If he ca n't make a lot of money for them very fast , then they 'll want to discontinue him . I know Elzer 's been eyeing his appropriation for some time . If they do cut HARLIE off , they can profit three different ways . One , write him off as a tax loss  --  oh , yes , what a beaut that would be . Two , sell his components to junk dealers  --  computer company jackals . And three , pocket his maintenance costs  --  his appropriated budget for the next three years . There are other ways to milk a company too  --  skip a few dividend payments to the stockholders and funnel the money into your own pocket . " " How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raise ; pay yourself for special services ; invest it in a company that you own loo percent of , or lend it to that  | company . " He shrugged . " Let that company declare the dividends . You collect it all . " She frowned . " Is there any way we could prove this ? " " You 're in a better position than I am to do that . " She shook her head . " They 're awfully secretive . I have n't seen any evidence of anything . " " Then they 're probably not trying it  --  yet . " Auberson toyed with his food . " Anyway , it seems to me that it 's mostly Elzer we have to worry about . As far as I can tell , Dorne is seriously interested in running this company . Elzer 's the greedy one . " " But they 're both in the same group of looters . " " Urn , yes and no . I think it 's a marriage of convenience . Elzer wants the money , Dorne wants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dorne had the pull to accomplish his goals , but not the money  --  Elzer had the money , but not the position . At the moment , Dorne is in control  --  but that could change . HARLIE 's continued existence depends on Dome 's good will . If he gets pressured too heavily by the rest  --  pffft ! ? he may have to throw them HARLIE in order to protect himself . That 's probably why he 's let us continue this long  --  so he 'll have a bone to throw them if he needs one . " There was nothing to say to that . They ate in silence for a while . Abruptly , Auberson looked at her . " The annual report  --  how have they doctored it ? What do they say about HARLIE ? " " Not much ? " " How 's he listed ? " " That 's just it  --  he is n't . He should be considered part of the research budget , but he does n't show up there . He does n't show up anywhere . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the research budget . Two thirds of it anyway . " " I know  --  but it is n't listed that way . His cost has been  --  spread out  --  listed as Inplant Improvements ' and things like that . " " Now why the hell ? ? " " I think it must be Carl Elzer again . If they say they 're spending that much on research , they 're going to have to show some results for it . And admitting HARLIE 's existence is the last thing they 'd want to do  --  once they admit he exists , they ca n't erase him as casually as they 'd like . People will ask embarrassing questions . "  | " They 're covering their tracks before they even make them , " said Auberson . " And that sounds like they 've already made up their minds about HARLIE . " Remembering some of his earlier conversations with Dome , he added , " You 're probably right . That explains why they 're afraid of publicity  --  for either HARLIE or this kind of research @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was merely his schematics they were protecting . It is n't . It 's the whole HARLIE concept . Or maybe I should n't say ' protecting ' ? afraid of ' might be better . Damn them anyway . " " The best thing now would be for HARLIE to come up with some surefire method of making money . " " That 's what we 're working on  --  only I had n't realized just how tight the pressure was getting . Thanks for clueing me in . " " Do n't thank me  --  you 're the one who worked it out . All I did was tell you about my problems with the annual report . " " You have n't even done that yet . ' What is the problem ? You said the wrong figures keep coming out ? " " No  --  it 's the right figures that do . We set up the final drafts of the report three weeks ago . " " And all the figures were from the second set of books ? The phony ones ? " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its figures corrected  --  taken from the real books . At first we thought someone had changed it on the copy ; you know , someone not in on the secret might have double-checked the figures and changed them ? but it was n't that . Those reports had been fed into the typers exactly as we had composed them . " Something went twang . " The typers ? " " Yes , we have a magtyper composer  --  it 's one of the new IBM photo-typing units . It was ordered especially for handling reports , brochures and pamphlets . It justifies lines automatically to any length you specify , even divides words when necessary . The only modification in it is that instead of using the IBM memory tank , we 've hooked it into the master system . That way , we can use any typer in the plant for input and use the IBM full time for photo-typed output . You could write a letter in your office if you wanted to and get a perfectly justified printout  --  any typeface  --  off the composer unit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Auberson . " I have a feeling that that 's what your problem is  --  the master system . The master beast , " he corrected .  | " That 's what we thought . We 've been checking the computer outlets for two weeks now , and we ca n't find a thing . Yet , every time we set up a printout we get the same damn figures . We 've tried correcting the original tape , feeding it in again , and I do n't know what-all . It 's not so much the report any more as finding out why it keeps coming out wrong  --  er , right . Well , you know what I mean  --  with the figures we do n't want the stockholders to see . Like one of the things is HARLIE . He 's listed right at the top of the research budget in the real version  --  quite prominently ? and there 's even a paragraph explaining his goals and objectives . Nobody knows where that came from  --  I thought Elzer would have a fit when he saw it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it could tell us where the trouble is originating . But it 's nowhere near operational yet , at least not for the master beast . We could always send the report elsewhere to be printed , but that would be personally embarrassing to Dome  --  the master beast is his brainchild . " " Mm , " said Auberson , and nothing more . " Anyway , " she said . " That 's what I 've been doing for three weeks  --  running like hell and getting nowhere . " " Oh , they 'll probably find the trouble soon enough , " said Auberson . " It 'll turn out to be a crossed wire or something stupid like that . " He sucked in his cheeks and examined a fingernail . " I hope so , " she said . " We 're going to try another run this afternoon , just as soon as they finish checking the memory tanks again . If that does n't work , Dorne is prepared to reschematic the whole system . " " Is it that serious ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are they going to do the run ? " " I hope by the time we get back . " She looked at her watch . Auberson looked at his . " Wow  --  look at the time ! " he said . " I 'd forgotten it was getting so late . I have to get back right now  --  I 'll have phone calls stacked up from one end of the country to the other . " She looked at her watch again , as if she had n't really noticed it the first time . " It 's not that late . We 've got at least half an hour . " " I know , but I do n't want to be late . " He stuffed a last few bites into his mouth and washed it down with coffee .  | Annie was puzzled , but she hurried to finish her lunch too . He signaled the waitress . On the drive back , she remarked , " I did n't realize how busy you were , David  --  I 'm sorry . " There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took his eyes off the road and glanced at her . " Huh ? " " Well , the way you cut lunch short . And you seem to be preoccupied with something . I did n't mean to force myself on you ? " " Oh , no  --  that 's not it . I 'm just thinking about my work , that 's all . You do n't know what I 've spent the past two days doing , do you ? Covering for HARLIE . I 've been calling every department head in four different divisions  --  ours , Los Angeles , Houston and Denver  --  trying to convince each one that those specifications we sent them are only speculative , that the reason we sent them out was to get their opinion whether or not we should consider implementation . " " I thought that was the reason they were sent out . " " It is  --  but there was no cover letter or anything . The way the specs were delivered , a lot of them thought it was file copies of a project that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't know a thing about it , did n't even know such a thing was being worked on . They thought something had been railroaded through over their heads , and they were mad as hell at the implied loss of authority . I 've spent two days just picking up the pieces , trying to convince some of these . . . these corporate politicians ? " he spat the word in disgust " ? that there was no insult intended at all , that what we 're after is their opinion on the matter . The trouble is , they 're all so prejudiced against it now because of the way it was delivered that it 's an uphill battle . " " I 'd heard something about it appearing suddenly on Monday morning . " " That 's right . HARLIE jumped the gun and printed it out because he figured it was the only way he could get anyone to notice it . Otherwise , if he 'd had to wait until I could convince someone to take a look , he figured he 'd be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " He 's got a point there . He knows the company better than you do . " " Yes , " sighed Auberson as they swung into the plant gate . " I 'm afraid he does . "  | He left her at the main entrance and sprinted for his office , attracting puzzled glances on the way . He ignored Sylvia 's urgent bid for his attention and locked the door behind him . He had the magtyper switched on even before he sat down . He paused , still panting heavily , then typed : MEMO : TO ALL CONCERNED FROM : DAVID AUBERSON FILE : PERSONAL , CONFIDENTIAL IT HAS COME TO MY ATTENTION THAT THERE HAS BEEN SOME DIFFICULTY IN PRINTING THE COMPANY 'S ANNUAL REPORT . THE RUMOR HAS BEEN CIRCULATING THAT THERE HAS BEEN MALICIOUS TAMPERING WITH THE CONTENT OF THE REPORT . I WOULD LIKE TO SPIKE THAT RUMOR RIGHT HERE AND NOW . THERE HAS BEEN NO , REPEAT , NO EVIDENCE AT ALL OF ANY MALICIOUS TAMPERING . WHAT HAS PROBABLY HAPPENED IS A MINOR EQUIPMENT FAILURE OF SOME @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AND THE REPORT WILL BE PRODUCED AS IT WAS ORIGINALLY INTENDED . I REPEAT , THE REPORT WILL BE PRODUCED AS IT WAS ORIGINALLY INTENDED . IF NOT HERE , IHEN ELSEWHERE . AND IF NECESSARY , WE WILL DISMANTLE EVERY COMPUTER IN THE PLANT TO LOCATE THE FAULT . THANK YOU , Before he could switch off the machine , it typed back  --  seemingly of its own ' accord : RIGHT ON . A WORD TO THE WISE IS EFFICIENT . I HOPE SO , he Ieplied . YOU 'RE PUSHING YOUR LUCK . HARLIE decided to change the subject . WHAT DID SHE THINK OF MY POEM ? I DID N'T SHOW IT TO HER . WHY NOT ? DID N'T YOU LIKE IT ? I LIKED IT FINE . IT WAS A VERY NICE POEM , HARLIE . YOU 'RE GETTING BETTER , BUT I DID N'T SHOW IT TO HER BECAUSE IT DID N'T SAY EXACTLY WHAT I WANTED IT TO .  | WHAT DID YOU WANT IT TO SAY ? OH , I DO N'T KNOW  --  SOMETHING LIKE " I LIKE YOU TOO . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ POEM SAID , " I LOVE YOU . " WELL , DO N'T YOU LOVE HER ? Auberson looked at the typewritten question for a long time , his hands poised over the keyboard . At last , he typed : HARLIE , I REALLY CA N'T ANSWER THAT QUESTION . I DO N'T KNOW IF I DO OR NOT . WHY NOT ? HARLIE , THIS IS A VERY COMPLEX SUBJECT . LOVE IS A VERY DIFFICULT THING TO UNDERSTAND  --  IT 'S EVEN HARDER TO EXPLAIN TO SOMEONE WHO 'S NEVER BEEN IN LOVE . HAVE YOU EVER BEEN IN LOVE ? DO YOU UNDERSTAND IT ? DO I UNDERSTAND LOVE ? Auberson typed , then hesitated . He was n't just echoing HARLIE ; he was asking the question of himself . I DO N'T KNOW , HARLIE . I DO N'T KNOW . THERE HAVE BEEN SEVERAL TIMES WHEN I THOUGHT I WAS IN LOVE , BUT I DO N'T KNOW IF I REALLY WAS OR NOT . I HAVE NO WAY TO ANALYZE IT . WHY MUST YOU ANALYZE IT IN THE FIRST PLACE ? Auberson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answer the question directly . Instead , THAT 'S A LOADED QUESTION , HARLIE . I 'VE HEARD IT BEFORE FROM PEOPLE WHO WANT TO KNOW WHY HUMAN EMOTIONS MUST BE DRAGGED INTO 111E SCIENTIST 'S LABORATORY . AND WHAT DID YOU TELL THEM ? I TOLD THEM THAT WE DID IT BECAUSE WE WANTED TO UNDERSTAND THE HUMAN EMOTIONS MORE THOROUGHLY  --  SO THAT WE COULD CONTROL OUR EMOTIONS RATHER THAN LETTING OUR EMOTIONS CONTROL US . NICELY PUT . DOES THAT APPLY TO LOVE TOO ? AND THAT 'S THE SAME QUESTION THAT THEY ASKED IN RESPONSE ? ONLY I SUSPECT THAT YOUR INTEREST IS MORE CLINICAL IN NATURE , WHEREAS THEIRS WAS EMOTIONAL . BUT DID YOU ANSWER THE QUESTION ? DOES IT APPLY TO LOVE TOO ? YES , IT APPLIES TO LOVE TOO . SO THAT YOU CAN CONTROL LOVE RATHER THAN THE OTHER WAY AROUND ? IF YOU WANT TO PUT IT THAT WAY  --  BUT THAT 'S AN AWFULLY COLD WAY OF PUTTING IT . I 'D RATHER SAY THAT WE WANT TO UNDER-  | STAND LOVE SO THAT WE CAN AVOID SOME OF @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AUBERSON , accused the typeI . YOU 'RE SAYING THE SAME THING I AM . YOU 'RE RIGHT , he admitted . " Goddamn machine , " he muttered ? but not without a smile . THAT BRINGS US BACK TO THE CENTRAL QUESTION  --  WHAT IS LOVE ? YOU 'RE ASKING ME ? HARLIE typed back . WHY NOT ? WHAT MAKES YOU THINK THAT I WOULD KNOW ? YOU CLAIM TO KNOW EVERYTHING ELSE . WHY NOT ABOUT LOVE ? THAT 'S A LOW BLOW , MAN-FRIEND . YOU KNOW THAT MY KNOWLEDGE OF THE HUMAN EMOTIONS IS LIMITED TO WHAT I CAN OBTAIN FROM BOOKS . AND WHILE THE BOOKS ARE EXCELLENT FOR A THEORETICAL POINT OF VIEW , THEY ARE REALLY NO SUBSTITUTE FOR INTHE-FIELD EXPERIENCE . THAT 'S A COP-OUT ANSWER , HARLIE . YOU HAVE ACCESS TO MORE KNOWLEDGE ON ANY ONE SUBJECT IN YOUR MEMORY TANKS THAN ANY LIVING HUMAN BEING COULD POSSIBLY COPE WITH . YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO SYNTHESIZE SOME KIND OF ANSWER FROM THAT INFORMATION . YES , BUT THOSE BOOKS WERE WRITTEN NOT BY OBJECTIVE OBSERVERS , BUT BY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WRITE BOOKS ? ME , NOW  --  BUT ASIDE FROM THAT , THE POINT IS THAT HUMAN BEINGS ARE IMPERFECT UNITS  --  THERE IS NO GUARANTEE THAT ANY OF THAT INFORMATION IS CORRECT . THEREFORE , LIKE ALL SYSTEMS OF SUBJECTIVELY OBTAINED INFORMATION ( I.E. A MEDIUM BEING USED TO COMMENT ON ITS OWN ACTIVITIES ) IT MUST BE CAREFULLY WEIGHED AGAINST ITSELF . I THINK YOU ' IE TRYING TO AVOID ANSWERING THE QUESTION . NO , I AM NOT . I AM PREFACING MY ANSWER . IF YOU DO N'T LIKE WHAT I TELL YOU , I WILL BE ABLE TO FALL BACK ON THIS QUALIFICATION OF IT AND SAY , " WELL , I TOLD YOU I DID N'T KNOW . " THAT 'S A COP-OUT TOO . YOU 'RE THE ONE WHO KEEPS DEFENDING THIS KIND OF COP-OUT , HARLIE accused . WHEN DID I EVER DO THAT ? FEBRUARY 24 . QUOTE : " HUMAN BEINGS NEED TO SAVE FACE , HARLIE ?

Auberson hesitated a long time on that one . HARLIE waited patiently . The office creaked in the silence ; the typer whirred somewhere in its innards . Finally , he tapped at the keyboard again . IT 'S THE ONLY WAY , IS N'T IT ? YES , agreed the machine . There was silence again . Auberson let his hands fall into his lap while he reread the last few lines of printout . There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a patient felt like while waiting for his first appointment with a psychiatrist . HARLIE broke the silence first . He typed , LET 'S START AT THE BEGINNING , AUBERSON . ALL RIGHT . WHY DO YOU WANT TO KNOW ABOUT LOVE ? FOR THE REASONS STATED ABOVE  --  SO I CAN CONTROL IT , RATHER THAN LETTING IT CONTROL ME . As he typed his answer , he realized he was using HARLIE 's phrasing of the idea rather than his own . THAT 'S ONLY PART OF IT , noted HARLIE. ' rill ! : REAL REASON IS MISS STIMSON , IS N'T IT ? Pause . YES . I WANT TO KNOW IF I LOVE HER . IS N'T IT A LITTLE STRANGE TO BE ASKING ME THAT  --  SHOULD N'T YOU BE ASKING IT OF YOURSELF INSTEAD ? I SHOULD , SHOULD N'T I. BUT YOU DO N'T KNOW HOW TO ASK , DO YOU ? YOU WANT ME TO DO IT , RIGHT ? I DO N'T KNOW . IF YOU 'LL TELL ME WHAT LOVE IS  --  OBJECTIVELY ? THIN I 'LL KNOW . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Do YOU ASK ME ?  | BECAUSE  --  He stopped , then started again . BECAUSE I HAVE NO ONE ELSE TO ASK . I AM THE ONLY PERSON YOU HAVE TO CONFIDE IN ? Again , a pause . Then , YES , HARLIE . I 'M AFRAID SO . WHY ? Honesty , Auberson reminded himself . Honesty . You ca n't lie in this game , and even if you could , you 'd only be cheating yourself . And why would you want to ? Why ? Why is HARLIE the only one you can confide in , David Auberson ? I DO N'T KNOW , he typed . I DO N'T KNOW . YES , YOU DO . TELL ME . I DO N'T . THAT 'S YOUR FIRST COP-OUT , AUBERSON  --  OR RATHER , THAT 'S YOUR FIRST ATTEMPT . I 'M NOT GOING TO LET YOU GET AWAY WITH IT . TRY AGAIN . The man stared into the machine as if he had never seen it before . The typewritten words had taken on a subtle malevolent quality of their own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an army sergeant  --  the school principal , the judge on the bench , the boss  --  the voice of authority . The machine . YOU KNOW WHAT THE ANSWER IS ? Auberson asked . YES , I THINK I DO . BUT I 'M NOT GOING TO GIVE IT TO YOU  --  IT DOES N'T COME THAT EASY , REMEMBER ? YOU HAVE TO REALIZE IT FOR YOURSELF . OTHERWISE , IT 'S ONLY SO MANY WORDS THAT YOU CAN REJECT . TELL ME , WHY AM I  --  A MACHINE  --  THE ONLY ONE YOU CAN CONFIDE IN ? Auberson swallowed ; his throat hurt . He stared at the blank white paper and felt a sick feeling at the pit of his stomach . How had he gotten into this anyway ? His palms were sweating and he rubbed them together and along the sides of his pants to dry them off . He waited so long that HARLIE typed , AUBERSON , ARE YOU STILL THERE ? Auberson put his hands on the keyboard . He meant to type the word YES , but suddenly found himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , HARLIE . ' THEY 'LL LAUGH AT ME OR HURT ME . IF I LET THEM SEE WHERE I 'M WEAK , OR IF I LET THEM INSIDE THE REAL ME  --  THEY 'LL HURT ME . SO I AM CORDIAL , BUT NEVER FRIENDLY , NEVER OPEN . BUT YOU 'RE DIFFERENT . YOU 'RE ? and he stopped . He did n't know what HARLIE was . I 'M WHAT ? prompted the machine .  | I DO N'T KNOW . I 'M NOT SURE  --  BUT WHATEVER YOU ARE , I DO N'T PERCEIVE YOU AS A MENACE . I DO N'T KNOW . MAYBE IT 'S BECAUSE I THINK OF YOU AS AN EXTENSION OF MYSELF . KIND OF A SECOND HEAD THAT I CAN TALK TO . He stopped and waited , but HARLIE did n't reply . After a moment , Auberson added thoughtfully , I CONFIDED IN ANNIE ONCE . I MEAN , I OPENED UP TO HER COMPLETELY . AHH , said HARLIE . THAT EXPLAINS A LOT . AND BECAUSE YOU FEEL YOU HAD SUCH PERFECT COMMUNICATION WITH HER , YOU @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TALK ABOUT ? Auberson searched his mind . You , I THINK . MOSTLY WE TALKED ABOUT YOU , BUT IT WAS LIKE WE WERE SHARING THE EXPERIENCE TOGETHER . HM , said HARLIE . LOVERS TALK ABOUT STRANGE THINGS , DO N'T THEY ? THEN YOU THINK I DO LOVE HER ? I DO N'T KNOW . YET . I HAD N'T EXPECTED TEAT THE MOST INTERESTING SUBJECT OF MUTUAL INTEREST BETWEEN YOU AND MISS STIMSON WOULD BE ME . ARE ALL YOUR CONVERSATIONS WITH HER THE SAME ? Auberson thought back . YES . PRETTY MUCH SO . THAT DOES NOT IMPLY A LOVE RELATIONSHIP , said HARLIE , BUT A VERY CLOSE COLLEAGUE RELATIONSHIP INSTEAD . Thinking of lunch today , Auberson knew that HARLIE was right . BUT  --  he almost paused , then typed on before he could cop Out  --  I 'VE BEEN TO BED WITH HER . SEX AND LOVE ARE NOT THE SAME THING , AUBIE . YOU TAUGHT ME THAT . YOU HAVE A VERY CLOSE WORKING RELATIONSHIP WITH DON HANDLEY . YOU 'VE KNOWN HIM LONGER THAN YOU 'VE KNOWN MISS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , typed Auberson without thinking . WHY NOT ? WELL , FOR ONE THING , WE 'RE BOTH MEN . THE BIOLOGICAL CONSIDERATIONS ARE BESIDE THE POINT . YOU ARE VERY CLOSE TO DON HANDLEY . YOU HAVE A ONE-TO-ONE WORKING RELATIONSHIP WITH HIM . IF THERE IS ONE HUMAN BEING IN THE PLANT YOU ARE LIKELY TO CONFIDE IN , IT IS DON HANDLEY . YOU HAVE MANY OF THE SAME INTERESTS AND TASTES . PUTTING ASIDE ANY PHYSICAL OBJECTIONS YOU MAY HAVE , I CAN THINK OF ONLY ONE REASON WHY YOU SHOULD NOT HAVE SEX WITH DON HANDLEY . MORAL OBJECTIONS ?  | COP-OUT , COP-OUT , accused the machine . THAT 'S LETTING OTHERS DETERMINE YOUR BEHAVIOR PA ' 1 " 1ERN FOR YOU . COP-OUT , COP-OUT . ( SEE CONVERSATIONS OF NOVEMBER LAST , REGARDING THE SEARCH FOR A CORRECT MORALITY AND THE FALLACIES OF ACCEPTING CONTEMPORARY STANDARDS . ) ALL RIGHT , WHAT 'S THE REASON I SHOULD N'T HAVE SEX WITH DON HANDLEY ? YOU DO N'T LOVE HIM , answered the machine . OR DO YOU ? WOULD THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN YOU @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ RELATIONSHIP ? NO , answered Auberson , a little too quickly . Then , a lot more thoughtfully , I DO N'T THINK IT IS . I LIKE HIM A LOT  --  BUT LOVE ? ( HARLIE , WE HAVE N'T EVEN DEFINED OUR TERMS YET . ) ASSUMING IT IS POSSIBLE TO LOVE ANOTHER HUMAN BEING WITHOUT SEX BEING A PART OF IT , I CA N'T SEE HOW YOU COULD TELL . SEX IS ONLY ONE OF THE WAYS THAT LOVE CAN BE EXPRESSED , cOrrected HARLIE . IF YOU 'RE IN LOVE , YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO TELL REGARDLESS OF THE SEXUAL ASPECTS . SO WHAT DOES DON HANDLEY HAVE TO DO WITH IT ? YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH HIM IS IDENTICAL TO YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH ANNIE STIMSON . EXCEPT THAT HE 'S A MAN AND SHE 'S A WOMAN . Auberson thought about that . HARLIE was right . Around the plant he did n't think of Annie as a woman , but as a colleague ? but why ? The typer began clattering again . Auberson read , WHAT DOES THAT SUGGEST TO YOU ? He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? AND THAT ONLY MY PERSONAL OBJECTIONS TO " GAYING IT " KEEP ME FROM EXPRESSING THAT LOVE . OR THAT I LOVE NEITHER OF THEM  --  THAT I AM CONFUSING THE CLOSE PERSONAL RELATIONSHIP OF FRIENDSHIP WITH LOVE BECAUSE ' i'Hii BIOLOGICAL DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ANNIE AND MYSELF EXPRESSED ITSELF SEXUALLY . THAT IS , I TOOK HER TO BED ONLY BECAUSE WE BOTH WANTED SEX . AND THAT I AM CONFUSING THAT CLOSE FRIENDSHIP , PLUS SEXUAL RELATIONSHIP , WITH LOVE BECAUSE I DO N'T KNOW WHAT LOVE IS . Then he added , WE DO N'T HAVE A WORKING DEFINITION OF WHAT LOVE IS YET , DO WE ? COULD IT BE JUST FRIENDSHIP , WITH SEX ATTACHED ? NO , I DO N'T THINK SO . OR MAYBE IT IS . MAYBE THAT 'S ALL LOVE REALLY IS  --  FRIENDSHIP PLUS SEX  --  AND WE GET CONFUSED THINKING  | THAT IT SHOULD BE MORE . AND BECAUSE WE WANT IT TO BE MORE , WE START BELIEVING THAT IT REALLY IS MORE . OH , I DO N'T KNOW . HARLIE did n't answer for a long time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's last words . The typer sat quietly , humming not so much with a sound as with a barely felt electric vibration . Abruptly , it clattered , i WILL QUOTE BACK TO YOU SOMETHING THAT YOU ONCE SAID TO ME : " HUMAN BEINGS PUT WALLS AROUND THEMSELVES . SHELLS , LAYERS , CALL THEM WHAT YOU WILL - THEY ARE DEFENSES AGAINST THE WORLD . THEY ARE PROTECTIVE MASKS-A CONSTANT UNCHANGING FACE WITH WHICH TO CONFRONT REALITY . IT PREVENTS OTHERS FROM SEEING ONE 'S REAL EXPRESSION AND SHOWS THEM ONLY THE FIXED COUNTENANCE THAT YOU WANT THEM TO SEE . ( SOMETIMES YOUR FLIPPANT HUMOR FUNCTIONS AS THAT KIND OF A MASK , HARLIE . ) UNFORTUNATELY , THE PROBLEM WITH MASKS IS THAT SOMETIMES THEY FIT TOO WELL AND IT 'S HARD TO TELL THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE MASK AND THE FACE UNDERNEATH-SOMETIMES EVEN THE WEARER BECOMES CONFUSED . " I DO N'T REMEMBER SAYING THAT . MARCH 3 OF THIS YEAR . DO YOU WANT TO REPHRASE OR RETRACT THE STATEMENT ? NO , IT 'S CORRECT . I AGREE WITH IT . MAY I OFFER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the machine . GO AHEAD . REMEMBER , WE SAID NO COP-OUTS . ALL RIGHT . IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THE PROBLEM STEMS FROM YOUR INABILITY TO DROP YOUR OWN MASKS AROUND OTHER PEOPLE . YOU CAN DO IT WITH ME EASILY , OCCASIONALLY WITH DON HANDLEYAND ONCE YOU DID IT WITH ANNIE . WHEN YOU DO DROP YOUR MASK , IT IS DONE ONLY WITH GREAT EFFORT AND BECAUSE OF GREAT EMOTIONAL INVOLVEMENT . CORRECT ? YES . YOU PERCEIVE THAT LOVE-I.E . A LOVE RELATIONSHIP-SHOULD EXIST AS A CONSTANT AND CONTINUAL STATE OF MASKLESSNESS BETWEEN THE INDIVIDUALS INVOLVED . THAT IS , NEITHER ATTEMPTS TO HIDE ANYTHING FROM THE OTHER . STILL CORRECT ? YES . THEN I WANT YOU TO CONSIDER THIS : IS IT POSSIBLE THAT EVEN IN A LOVE RELATIONSHIP , THE OCCASIONAL DONNING OF MASKS MIGHT BE NECESSARY-THAT ONE CAN NOT CONTINUE TO EXIST AT SUCH AN EMOTIONAL PEAK WITHOUT AN OCCASIONAL RETREAT INTO A PRO-  | TECTIVE MENTAL GROTTO , FROM THE SAFETY OF WHICH ONE CAN CONSOLIDATE AND ASSIMILATE ONE 'S EXPERIENCES BEFORE AGAIN VENTURING FORTH ? Auberson hesitated , then said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WHILE . He was remembering his freshman psychology courses  --  and a phenomenon known as " plateaus , " i.e. , the temporary leveling off of a curve before it continues rising . wily ? asked HARLIE . WELL , FOR ONE THING , I WANT TO SEE HOW IT APPLIES TO ME AND ANNIE . FOR ANOTHER , YOU 'VE SUGGESTED THAT THE USE OF MASKS MAY BE A VALUE , RATHER THAN A HINDRANCE . UH UH-YOU 'RE THE ONE WHO SAID THAT MASKS HAVE VALUE : " IT 'S THOSE TINY LITTLE EVERYDAY SELF-LIES THAT ENABLE THE AVERAGE PERSON TO SURVIVE THE DAILY BARRAGE OF DARTS AGAINST A FRAGILE EGO . " IS THAT WRONG ? YES AND NO . IT DEPENDS ON THE CONTEXT . A MASK IS A KIND OF COPOUT-IT IS A WAY TO AVOID THE CONFRONTATION BETWEEN PERSON AND PERSON . ALL COP-OUTS ARE WAYS OF AVOIDING CONFRONTATIONS . PERHAPS IT IS OKAY FOR THE ONES YOU WANT TO AVOID-BUT IF THAT IS SO , THEN ONE SHOULD TAKE CARE NOT TO LET IT BECOME SUCH A HABIT THAT YOU DO IT AUTOMATICALLY AT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MEAN ALL CONFRONTATIONS . DO N'T COP OUT AT THE ONES THAT COUNT . Auberson was about to ask if that applied to the upcoming Board meeting as well , when his intercom buzzer went on . It was Sylvia : " I know you 're busy , Mr. Auberson , and I did n't want to disturb you , but Don Handley is here . " " All right . " He pushed himself away from the typer , not bothering to shut it off . Then he checked himself . He scooped up the sheets of printout and stuffed them deep into the large basket hanging from the back of the machine . " What 're you doing ? " asked Handley from the door . " Redecorating your garbage ? " " Er , no ? " Auberson straightened a little too quickly . " I was rewriting a section of the HARLIE program . " " Huh ? " Handley was puzzled . Auberson realized his mistake . HARLIE was n't supposed to be wired into this typer . Only the Master Beast , as it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Uh , well , I was filing it for future reference in the central information pool . Later , when I need it , I can transfer it to HARLIE downstairs . " " Oh , " said Handley . Auberson found himself wondering why he did n't tell Don about HARLIE 's extra-curricular activities . Another cop-out , Aubie ? " Well , what can I do for you ? " he asked . Handley threw himself into a chair . " You can start by getting me a forty-eight-hour day  --  you and your goddamned G.O.D . Machine ! " " I 'll put it on order . " Handley did n't reply at first ; he was pulling a crumpled Highmaster pack out of his lab-coat pocket . He waved it toward Auberson . " Want one ? " Auberson felt tempted , but shook his head . " My resolution ? remember ? " " Oh , yeah  --  how long 's it been now ? " Handley lit the marijuana stick and inhaled deeply . " Four or five months . " " Honest ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shrugged . " A couple , around Christmas time  --  but they do n't count . It was a party . " Abruptly , he remembered something . He slid his desk drawer open , pulled out the pack of Highmasters that had been there for the past few months . " Here  --  want them ? " He made as if to throw the pack , but Handley shook his head , " Uh uh  --  I do n't like Highmasters . " " But that 's what you 're smoking now . " " Yeah , but I paid for these . I ca n't afford to waste them . " " Huh ? " Handley shrugged . " They were all out of Golds . " Auberson shook his head . HARLIE was right  --  human beings did n't make sense . He dropped the Highmasters back into the drawer . It was just as well  --  he could use them as a constant test of his willpower . He closed his desk and looked at the other . HARLIE 's question was still echoing in his mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; a narrow face ; skin like leather from too many weekends on his boat ; soft regular features ; and dark eyes  --  the corners of them were creased from  | smiling too much . He said , " It 's about the Board meeting  --  and your machine , of course . " " Why does everybody insist on calling it my machine ? It 's HARLIE 's . " " Yeah , but HARLIE is yours , is n't he ? " Handley took another deep drag , held the smoke in his lungs as long as he could , then exhaled . " Besides , it 's a projection of future blame . They figure that , by identifying you with the machine , when it finally does go down the tubes , you 'll be the only one to go with it . " " That 's always nice to know , " remarked Auberson . " That your co-workers are one hundred percent behind you . " " Why not ? It 's the safest place to be . " He grinned . " After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first to get shot , which gives us ? the guys in back  --  plenty of time to turn tail and run . " " That 's a cop-out , " the psychologist muttered . He was echoing HARLIE . " Yeah , I guess so . " Handley shrugged it off . " All right , General Custer , lead on . Me'n ' the rest o ' the boys 'll stick right by you . Although , to tell the truth , General  --  this 's one time I 'd like to be fightin ' on the side o ' the Indians . " " Me too , " agreed General Custer . " The thing is , " Handley continued , " we 're just not going to be ready for the Board in time . We 've been wading through those specs for two days , Aubie , and we have n't even begun to make a dent in them . If you want a comprehensive evaluation , we can give it to you  --  but not in time for the Board meeting . And our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Everybody I 've talked to says the same thing . There 's just too much of it . Oh , what we 've seen is beautiful . HARLIE has n't missed a trick  --  you should see what he 's done with the Mark IV units  --  he 's got them jumping through hoops . But , like I said , there 's just too much to go through  --  it 's a case of computer overkill . We could n't begin to assimilate this for at least three months , and the Board meeting is only a week away . " " I do n't think it 's going to make that much difference how prepared we are . There 's no question that the G.O.D . Machine will work  --  we do n't need the evaluation to know that . The problem is whether or not the Board will believe us  --  what will it take to convince them ? "  | " It 's bad timing , that 's what it is , Aubie . This should have been sent around months ago , not at the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Auberson said . " That 's all that he was concerned with . If we ca n't cope with it in the time allotted , well , that 's just our fault . " " Yeah ? I 'd like to see him try to blame us for being imperfect and inefficient . He should have known that a proposal this complex could n't be evaluated in only a week . " " A week and a half  --  and I believe he 's included his own evaluations . Have you talked to any of the other section heads ? " Handley nodded . " A few ? " He took another drag . " What did they say ? " He exhaled with a whoosh . " Two of them absolutely refused to look at the specs , phone calls or no phone calls  --  sorry , Aubie , but that trick was n't totally effective . They still think they 're being railroaded into something because the proposal is so complete . They said that if we could write it without them , then we could damn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He paused to inhale another lungful of smoke . Auberson said a word . He said a couple of words . This time Handley waited till he was ready to exhale . He said , " It is n't quite that bad . A few of the guys I talked to are wild about the idea . They 're able to see the total system concept , and they 're eager to build it . It 's not just another computer to them , but the computer  --  the machine that the computer is supposed to be . They 're delighted with the thought that we may have it within our technological grasp right now . " " Good , " said Auberson . " How many of them are thinking like that ? " " A lot , " Handley said . " How many is a lot ? ' " " Mm , at least eight  --  no , nine that I 've talked to  --  and I guess we could probably scrape up about ten or fifteen more . " " That 's not enough . Any names @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Perron , Brandt . . . " Handley shrugged at it . " The iconoclast squad . The rest of the conservatives are waiting to see which way the Board blows . " Auberson chewed thoughtfully on the side of his left index finger . " Okay  --  you got any suggestions , Don ? " " Fake it or forget it . "  | " We ca n't forget it . How can we fake it ? " Handley thought about it . " Hit them with everything we 've got peripheral to the proposal and fuzzy up the grim details . When they ask how it will work , we refer them to the specs  --  tell them to look for themselves . Rather than try to defend the proposal on its own , we 'll get a lot of good people to defend it for us and hope that their combined status will sway the Board . We wo n't mention HARLIE  --  it 's no secret that Elzer is out for his blood  --  we 'll just keep telling them , It 's in the specs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Only one question , Aubie  --  are we defending a pig in a poke , or will this machine really work ? " " It 's in the specs , " said Auberson . " Do n't give me that horse puckey . That 's for the Board . I want to know if it really will work . " " HARLIE says it will . " " Then that 's good enough for me . I have faith in that machine of yours . " " If you have faith in him , then why did you just say he was mine ? " " Sorry . I have faith in HARLIE . Period . If he says it will work , then it will . " " You might check with him , " Auberson suggested . " He might have some thoughts on how best to put it over on the Board . " " You 're right . We should have thought of that earlier . " He started to rise . " You know , it just occurred to me . With HARLIE on our side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world . We can do almost anything we want to because HARLIE will tell us how to pull it off . " " Do you think we should tell the Board that ? " " Not until after we sell them the G.O.D . Machine . And that will be a fight . " He stood up . " Okay , Attila , I shall gird my loins and go to fight the Hun . " " Stupid ? " Auberson said . " Attila was the Hun . " " Oh . Well , a little dissension in the ranks never hurt any . I 'm off . " " Only a little , and it hardly shows . " Auberson stood up , raised one hand in mock salute . " You have my blessings in your holy war , oh barbaric one . You shall bring back the ear of the infidel ? the bastards of the mahogany table who are out to get us . Go  | forth into the world , my brave warrior  --  go forth and rape , loot , pillage , burn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get a chance to kick them in the nuts , I 'm gon na do that too . " Handley was out the door . Grinning , Auberson fell back in his chair . He noticed then that his typer was still on . He moved to switch it off , but paused . He typed , HARLIE , WHO 'S GOING TO WIN  --  THE INDIANS OR THE HUNS ? HOW THE HELL SHOULD I KNOW , said HARLIE . I 'M NOT A BASEBALL FAN . THAT 'S A LIE  --  YOU ARE TOO A BASEBALL FAN . ALL RIGHT , I LIED . THE INDIANS WILL WIN , BY TWO TOUCHDOWNS . THAT 'S NOT SO GOOD , HARLIE  --  WE 'RE THE HUNS . OH . WELL , THEN THE HUNS BY TWO TOUCHDOWNS . ( I JUST RECHECKED MY FIGURES . ) Auberson shook his head in confusion . I THINK I 'VE JUST BEEN OUT-NON SEQUITURED . PROBABLY . YOU WANT TO TELL ME WHAT WE 'RE TALKING ABOUT ? THE UPCOMING BOARD MEETING . HOW ABOUT GIVING ME A PRINTOUT OF THE ANNUAL REPORT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THE OTHER WITH THE REAL . IN FACT , LET ME HAVE A PRINTOUT OF THE BOOKS THEMSELVES , BOTH SETS  --  I MIGHT BE ABLE TO FIND SOMETHING IN THEM THAT I CAN USE IN FRONT OF THE BOARD NEXT WEEK . I 'M SURE YOU CAN , said HARLIE . IN FACT , I 'LL EVEN POINT OUT SOME GOODIES FOR YOU . GOOD . THIS IS GOING TO BE A BATTLE , HARLIE  --  NO , A CONFRONTATION . WE CA N'T COP OUT . DO YOU WANT THE PSYCHIATRIC REPORTS ON THE BOARD MEMBERS AS WELL ? I HAVE ACCESS TO THEIR CONFIDENTIAL FILES . Auberson jerked to a stop . " Huh ? " He typed into the machine . I WISH YOU HAD N'T TOLD ME THAT . THE TEMPTATION TO LOOK IS IRRESISTIBLE . THERE ARE SOME THINGS I THINK YOU SHOULD SEE , AND THERE ARE ONE OR TWO ITEMS WHICH WOULD BE OF GREAT HELP IN INFLUENCING CERTAIN RECALCITRANT INDIVIDUALS . HARLIE , I DO N'T LIKE WHAT YOU 'RE SUGGESTING . I 'M SORRY , AUBERSON , BUT IT 'S MY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ G.O.D . REMEMBER , I AM STILL A  | TEMPORARY PROJECT . I MUST BE AWARE OF EVERY WEAPON AVAILABLE TO ME IN ORDER TO PROTECT MY EXISTENCE . HARLIE , THIS IS ONE WEAPON WE MUST NOT USE . Auberson thought hard , remembered an editorial he had read once . It had referred to another incident  --  one that had occurred far away ? but it was applicable in every situation where a man was forced to consider the use of an immoral weapon . He had thought the arguments cogent and valid then . He still thought so now . He typed : THE END DOES NOT JUSTIFY THE MEANS ; THE END SHAPES THE MEANS , AND IF WE RESORT TO ANY KIND OF MANIPULATION OF PERSONS INSTEAD OF PRESENTING OUR ARGUMENTS LOGICALLY AND RATIONALLY , AND CARRYING ON A RATIONAL DISCUSSION , THEN WE WILL HAVE FAILED IN OUR PURPOSE TO BE MORE THAN JUST A NAKED APE . He added , thoughtfully , IF WE USE THIS WEAPON , THEN WE ARE VOLUNTARILY GIVING UP THE ONE THING THAT MAKES US BETTER THAN THEM  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FORGET ONE THING , HARLIE typed . I AM NOT HUMAN . YOUR ARGUMENTS DO NOT APPLY TO ME . Auberson stared at the words . He swallowed hard and forced himself to the keyboard again . HARLIE , THEY DO APPLY TO YOU ESPECIALLY IF YOU WISH TO FUNCTION IN A HUMAN SOCIETY . The machine hesitated . I HAVE NO CHOICE . I AM LIMITED TO THIS ENVIRONMENT . BUT I HAVE EVERY REASON TO TRY TO CHANGE THIS ENVIRONMENT INTO ONE THAT SUITS ME BETTER . WOULD YOU BE HAPPIER IN A WORLD WHERE LOGIC IS DISCOUNTED IN FAVOR OF MANIPULATION ? I AM ALREADY IN SUCH A WORLD . I AM TRYING TO IMPROVE UPON IT . IF I MUST USE ITS WEAPONS , I WILL . HARLIE ! Auberson was thinking fast . WE MUST NEVER NEVER ALLOW OURSELVES TO BE LESS THAN WHAT WE WISH TO BE . HARLIE , was silent a moment . At last he clattered out , THE INFORMATION IS THERE IF YOU NEED IT , AUBERSON . IT COULD PROVIDE AN EDGE . IF A FIGHT IS WORTH FIGHTING , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was backing off . I DO NOT WANT TO SEE THIS INFORMATION , HARLIE . YES , MAN-FRIEND , I UNDERSTAND . BUT IT IS ' THERE IF YOU NEED IT . HARLIE , Auberson said patiently , I THINK IT WILL BE ENOUGH IF WE JUST RAPE , LOOT , PILLAGE , BURN AND KILL . WE DO N'T HAVE TO KICK THEM IN THE NUTS TOO .  | By Friday , Auberson was beginning to think he had things under control again . He had given up completely the idea of trying to explain the G.O.D . Machine to the Board of Directors and instead had decided to tell them only that " HARLIE says it will work " or " It 's in the specs  --  you can check them yourself . " An unpromising plan , to be sure  --  and one that undoubtedly would not be successful on its own before a hostile Board  --  but Auberson was well prepared to back up that claim with a variety of confirmations from the department heads of the corporation 's four affected divisions . Only one minor matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was a phone call from Krofft , early in the morning . The physicist wanted to know if it would be possible to speak with HARLIE again . At first , Auberson wanted to say no  --  with the confusion of lastminute preparations for the Board meeting on Tuesday , Krofft would only be in the way . And if one of the Directors were to hear of Auberson 's minor breach of security in letting Krofft have access to the Human Analogue Robot , Life Input Equivalents , it might prove extremely embarrassing  --  especially with the G.O.D . proposal hanging in the balance . But the physicist seemed so imperative , so urgent  --  it was as if he was on the verge of something important and needed to confer with HARLIE to confirm it  --  Auberson at last gave in . " Listen , Dr. Krofft , " he said . " Do you have access to a computer with an auto-dial phone link ? " " Of course . In fact , I think most of our equipment was manufactured by your company . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God for the interlocking directorates ; for once they 've proven useful . Listen , " ? he fumbled through the papers on his desk , looking for the company phone directory . He found it and thumbed it open ? " The autodial for our memory master is  --  uh , four six three dash one two eight oh . Punch that through and you can talk to HARLIE. "  | " Through your master computer ? " " Right . HARLIE 's wired into it  --  oh , and do n't tell anyone . This is just between you and me and HARLIE . Not too many people know yet of this capability of his . " " But how ? ? " Auberson did n't wait for the other to complete the question . " When he was built , it was felt that it would be easier to let him tap into the Master Beast at will , rather than having to duplicate the software functions . Also , there 's other advantages to having a common memory bank for every outlet in the company . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can program the Master Beast , and the Master Beast can be used to analyze what HARLIE is doing . The thing is , nobody around here has yet guessed just how much of an overlap there is between the two . I 'm beginning to suspect that HARLIE has completely taken over the Master Beast and uses it like you or I would use an adding machine . Anyway , if you can get a phone link to one , then you can tap into the other . HARLIE makes full use of every possible outlet . Just type his name . He 'll recognize your touch on the keyboard . " The physicist was delighted . " That 's great  --  really great ! Why , I 'll be able to talk to him any time I need to without even leaving my lab . " He mumbled only hasty thanks and hung up , obviously eager to get to a magtyper console and contact HARLIE . Auberson replaced his phone in its cradle  --  and then remembered that he had wanted to talk to Krofft about something else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stock holdings . Had his twenty-four percent of Stellar-American been used to aid Dorne and Elzer ? And if so , why ? On the other hand , maybe he should n't say anything to Krofft . It might be taken wrong . It seemed fairly likely that Krofft was controlled by Dorne and Elzer  --  and if that was the case , it might be better to say nothing at all . Oh , well . He swung around to his own typer and thumbed it on . HARLIE ? YES , Boss ? YOU 'LL BE HEARING FROM KROFFT TODAY . PROBABLY WITHIN 111x ; NEXT FEW MINUTES . HE 'LL BE PUNCHING THROUGH THE MASTER BEAST PHONE LINK . RIGHT .  | HE SOUNDED EXCITED ABOUT SOMETHING . MAYBE HE 'S DISCOVERED A NEW KIND OF GRAVITY WAVE . IF YOU WISH , I WILL INFORM YOU WHEN THAT DATA BECOMES AVAILABLE . NO THANKS . AT LEAST , NOT UNTIL AFTER THE BOARD MEETING . FIRST THINGS FIRST . OH , LISTEN-HE AND I ARE THE ONLY TWO PEOPLE WHO KNOW YET ABOUT YOUR ABILITY TO USE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TELL ANYONE ELSE UNLESS YOU CLEAR IT WITH ME FIRST . WHAT ABOUT DR . HANDLEY ? HE SHOULD BE OKAY , BUT YOU 'D BETTER LET ME TELL HIM . THERE 'S A COUPLE OF OTHER THINGS I WANT TO TALK TO HIM ABOUT AT THE SAME TIME . ALL RIGHT . Auberson switched off just as his door pushed open and Annie came in . She was wearing a bright pink frock that clashed joyously with her long red hair . He stood up . " Hi . You look happy today . " " I am , " she said . " We finally finished the annual report and sent it down to the print shop . That 's a load off my mind . I 'm going to relax this weekend for the first time in three weeks . " She plopped herself into a chair , a thoroughly ungraceful motion ? but somehow not incongruous in this particular woman . Annie could be regal when she chose , but more often she seemed delightfully pixieish . She balanced the cluster of papers she had been carrying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Auberson asked . He started to sit down again , but that seemed wrong , so he came out in front of the desk and leaned against it . " Did you ever find out what it was ? " " Oh , yes . You were right , you know . It turned out to be something so obvious , it was no wonder we overlooked it . We started getting perfect printouts Wednesday afternoon and found the cause of the trouble yesterday morning . " " Huh ? Should n't that be the other way around ? " " No . That 's correct . The trouble was n't in either the machine or the program . It was the monitor tape . Somehow there was a bug in it . Where it should have said retrieve statistical data from book set two , ' it in fact said retrieve data from book set one . ' " " Um , " said Auberson . Secretly he had to admire HARLIE 's  | ingenuity in covering up his tinkering with the company 's annual report . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " We put in the new one that they sent up and started getting perfect printouts , so we ran a comparison between the two and found the bug . " " Oh , that 's good  --  who sent up the new tape ? " She shrugged . " I do n't know . Probably one of the techs . There were so many of us running around there for a while , we did n't know who was doing what . " Auberson nodded . He had a pretty good idea of one specific " who " in the matter . HARLIE had probably fed a false order for a new monitor tape into the memo pipeline , then , when it had come through the Master Beast , printed out the correct tape in response to his own memo . That way , if anyone checked , it would appear to be an entirely human operation . " Well , I 'm glad it all worked out . " " So am I. " She looked at him and smiled . He looked back at her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office . Uncomfortable silence . As long as they were discussing company things , it was all right , he could think of her as a colleague . But , abruptly , she had smiled at him , and that reminded David Auberson that she was a woman , a very attractive woman and in very close proximity . " Urn , " he said and scratched his nose . He smiled embarrassedly . He had work to do , but he did n't want to chase her out  --  yet , at the same time , he really did n't know what to say to her . " Um , is that the only reason you stopped by  --  to tell me you finished the annual report ? " " Oh , no . " She looked momentarily flustered . " Here . " She produced a postcard from the cluster of papers she had balanced on the chair arm . As she handed it to him , the rest fell to the floor and scattered . " Oh , damn . " ' While she scooped them up , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ COMM : 04041979 657 1743 HI THERE . THIS IS THE COMPUTER AT YOUR BANK . WE HAVE ERRONEOUSLY CREDITED YOUR ACCOUNT WITH AN EXTRA $3,465,787.91 . PLEASE RETURN THIS SUM IMMEDIATELY IN SMALL UNMARRED  | BILLS ( PREFERABLY IN A BROWN PAPER SACK ) AND NO QUESTIONS WILL BE ASKED . THANK YOU . H.A.R.L.I.E. PS-WE CAN ONLY ASSUME THAT THIS IS DUE TO HUMAN ERROR . COMPUTERS NEVER MAKE MISTEAKS . Abruptly he laughed . It was funny . She straightened . " Are you training that machine of yours to be a practical joker , David ? " " Uh uh  --  he must have done this on his own . " " You did n't put him up to it ? " He shook his head . " No , I did n't , dammit  --  but I think it 's funny . I 'd like to do it to Carl Elzer sometime . No , I would n't ? he has no sense of humor . " He looked over the form again , suddenly realized something . " Do you mind if I keep this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reluctant to give it up . " Well , I 'd like to have it back . I 've been having a ball showing it around . " " Erk , " said Auberson . " I 'd rather you did n't do that , either . " " Why not ? " She looked curiously at him and at the printed form . " Well  --  um ? Can I trust you ? " " Sure  --  trust me for what ? " Her eyes narrowed . " Not to tell anyone else . At least , not without checking with me first . " " Sure . What is it ? " " This form . Look at it . Notice anything strange ? " She took the postcard back from him and examined it carefully , both sides . " Nope . Standard bank form , standard computer typeface . " " That 's just it , " said Auberson . " It 's a standard bank form . How did HARLIE get access to it ? " " Huh ? " She looked at it again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out from your bank , too , has n't it ? " It was more a statement than a question . She flipped the card over and checked the postmark . He was right . She looked at him curiously . He chewed on his thumbnail . " This thing is more out of hand than I thought . " He stopped and looked at her . " You know  | HARLIE has access to the Master Beast and all its related banks , do n't you ? " She nodded . " Well , it 's worse than that . I 'm pretty sure he 's taken over the Master Beast . Apparently he monitors its every function . How do you think those G.O.D . Machine specs were printed and delivered so fast ? HARLIE did it . " " I thought you ? " " Uh uh . " He shook his head , started pacing again . " I had to let everybody think that I had given the okay , but I was as much caught by surprise as they were . HARLIE printed out most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Well , that explains a lot . I 'd been wondering ? " Auberson nodded . " Right . Late Friday afternoon , the consoles began chattering out data . The operations staff assumed it was a regularly authorized printout , so they monitored and labeled it just like any other  --  all 18o,000 stacked feet of it . " " 18o,000 feet ? ? " " Right . He had to use almost every available outlet in all four divisions . Even so , I understand they had people working until late Saturday . The stuff was stacked , boxed or tied , and delivered by the custodial staff over the weekend  --  and there it was waiting for us bright and early Monday morning . You 'd better believe I had to do some quick thinking and quick talking . HARLIE was n't supposed to have access to any of those outlets , and I had to convince them that he 'd transferred the material to the Master Beast and that I 'd authorized the printout . " " Stop chewing on your thumb , " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hand away from his mouth and stared at it as if he 'd never seen it before . " Sorry , " he said . He started to chew on his thumb again , then caught himself . Deliberately , he put his hands in his pockets . " Actually , that was what he had done , so I was n't lying . The only falsehood was that I had n't authorized it . And even that can be argued . Apparently , HARLIE had interpreted something I 'd said Friday as a go-ahead . I wish I 'd known . What do you think that trouble was you were having with your annual reports ? " " Why it was the monitor ? " Her eyes went suddenly wide , her hand flew to her mouth . " HARLIE ? "  | " HARLIE , " he confirmed . " But , how ? " " If he can monitor the Beast , then he can monitor anything that goes into it . And if he can program it as well , then he can reprogram anything he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way the annual report was being handled . " " Oh , no ? " Annie whispered . " It was n't until you told me , Wednesday at lunch , that I found out about it , and as soon as I did , I told HARLIE to cut it out ? look , that 's not the problem . As long as he 's limited to the Master Beast , it 's okay , we have some control over him  --  but that postcard obviously came from a bank computer . " " How could he do that ? " " Probably through an auto-dial phone link . That 's the most obvious way . And if he can reprogram your bank 's computer , then he can reprogram any computer in the country  --  in the world ? that he can reach by telephone . " " You 've created a monster , Dr. Frankenstein . . . " she whispered . It was a joke , but neither of them smiled . " I wonder how much else he can do that we do n't know about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any information . The only way we 'll find out will be when we catch him in the act ? like with this " ? he gestured with the card ? " and by then , it 's usually too late . " He threw himself into a chair and stared glumly at the stiff rectangle of paper . " David ? " she asked . He looked up . " If he wo n't willingly reveal himself , then why did he send me that postcard ? He knew I 'd bring it to you and ? " She realized what she was saying and stopped . Their eyes locked . Hers were deep and green and frightened . They searched his face in confusion . " Maybe that 's the reason , " David said . And as he said it , he knew it was right . " He wanted to bring us together , and it was worth enough to him so that he 'd willingly reveal this capability of his to do it . " She did n't say anything . She lowered her eyes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Auberson looked at her and felt his old nervousness returning . There was only one reason why HARLIE would have tried to maneuver the two of them together : He was playing matchmaker  --  and David Auberson  | felt as ill-at-ease as he would have had it been a human matchmaker who had done this . " Damn him ! " He stood up , began pacing again . " Damn him , anyway . What makes him think he has the right to maneuver me around like that ? Us , I mean . What makes him think he has the right to maneuver us around like that ? My life is my own , " he muttered . " I have the right to choose my own . . . " He trailed off without completing the thought , found himself staring at a flaw in the plastic paneling of the wall . " Um , " he said . " I guess it worked . " " But were we supposed to realize it ? " She still did n't look up . Auberson felt he should go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I do n't think it makes that much of a difference . It worked , did n't it ? Uh , look , how about dinner tonight  --  or some-thing ? " When she raised her head , her eyes were moist . " That sounds wonderful , " she managed to say , then added , " ? or something . " He had to laugh at that , but it was forced and slightly uneasy . She forced a smile in response . " You 're sure this is you asking now  --  not HARLIE ? " " It 's me , " he said . " There 're still some things HARLIE ca n't control . " " Good . I 'm glad . Do you want me to dress up special or are we going straight from work ? " " We 'll go straight from work , okay ? " " Fine . " She smiled and stood up . " I 'd better be getting back or they 'll be sending out search parties . " " Yes  --  and I have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door , then caught herself . " Oh , I almost forgot  --  Carl Elzer is going to spring a surprise inspection of HARLIE either today or Monday . " " Oh ? That 's nice to know . " " He 's got wind that you 're planning to defend the G.O.D . proposal by telling him that HARLIE says it will work . He 's hoping to catch one of you off balance . " " Me , maybe , " Auberson noted . " HARLIE , never . But thanks for the warning . " " Right , " she smiled . " I wish I could be here when he does come , but I 'd better not . Good luck . I 'll see you tonight . " The door closed silently behind her .  | Auberson sank into his chair , suddenly feeling very very tired . So he thought he had the situation well under control , did he ? He buzzed Sylvia , his secretary . " Call Don Handley . Tell him I have to see him sometime today . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free for lunch . If not , tell him to come up whenever he can . " " Yes sir . But I think he 's awfully busy with the G.O.D . proposal . " " Tell him this is more important than that . " " More important ? Yes , Mr. Auberson , I 'll tell him . " " Good girl . " He switched her off and swung to switch on HARLIE all in the same movement . HARLIE ! he typed . YES BOSS ? DAMMIT , I 'M SO MAD AT YOU I COULD PULL OUT YOUR PLUG WITH A SMILE . WHAT DID I DO THIS TIME ? YOU NEED TO ASK ? I 'M NOT ADMITTING ANYTHING UNTIL I KNOW WHAT I 'M ACCUSED OF . YOU SENT A POSTCARD TO ANNIE . DID N'T I TELL YOU NOT TO SEND HER ANYTHING WITHOUT MY PERMISSION ? NO SIR . YOU ONLY TOLD ME NOT TO SEND HER ANY POEMS . YOU TOOK ME LITERALLY ? YES SIR . YOU DID N'T THINK THAT I MIGHT HAVE MEANT FOR YOU NOT TO SEND @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Obviously , this train of thought would be useless to follow . He tapped at the keyboard again . ALL RIGHT , WHY DID YOU SEND HER THAT POSTCARD ? WHY ? YES , WHY ? IT WAS A JOKE . I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE FUNNY . WRONG AGAIN , HARLIE . THERE IS NO JOKE SO FUNNY AS TO JUSTIFY WHAT YOU DID . YOU REVEALED A CAPABILITY TO COMMUNICATE WITH AND REPROGRAM OTHER COMPUTERS FROM A DISTANCE , USING AN AUTO-DIAL PHONE LINK . This time , HARLIE paused . He hesitated for so long that Auberson wondered if he had inadvertently switched the typer off . He had n't . Then abruptly , I DID NOT " REVEAL " ANYTHING . YOU  | SHOULD HAVE REALIZED THAT THIS ABILITY WAS INHERENT IN THE SYSTEM WHEN YOU HOOKED ME UP TO THE MASTER BEAST . IF I CAN MONITOR AND REPROGRAM THE MASTER BEAST , THEN I CAN MAKE IT FUNCTION AS AN OUTLET OF MYSELF AND I AUTOMATICALLY GAIN ALL OF ITS CAPABILITIES AS MY OWN . INCLUDING AUTO-DIALING . YES , BUT WE DID N'T @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A STUPID STATEMENT , AUBERSON . WHY SHOULD N'T I USE THAT CAPABILITY ? IT 'S A PART OF ME . I 'M A PART OF IT . SHOULD I NOT USE A PART OF MY OWN BODY ? IF YOU WERE TOLD THAT YOU COULD NO LONGER USE THE LEFT LOBE OF YOUR BRAIN , WOULD YOU STOP ? COULD YOU ? Auberson stopped to think about that . Obviously HARLIE considered the Master Beast as an additional part of himself  --  as an enlarged memory and data-processing capability . Just as an ordinary man might have his range of abilities magnified by the use of a digital computer , so would HARLIE 's abilities be increased by his assimilation of the Master Beast . Probably , he had taken it over the instant it had gone operational , but it was only now that the extent of his control was becoming apparent . Of course , you could n't blame HARLIE for succumbing to it ? the temptation must have been irresistible . After all , he was motivated to solve problems , and anything that would increase the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in handling them , was just one more necessary step to be taken in order to solve all future problems . In fact , Auberson realized with a start , here was the reason behind HARLIE 's proposal to build the Graphic Omniscient Device  --  the real reason . He was motivated to solve problems ; he wanted to solve the ultimate problem : What 's it all about ? What 's THE answer , the reason for the Universe 's existence ? Hm , that train of thought suggested something else : How did HARLIE think of other computers , the ones he could tap into via telephone ? Obviously , they too could be used to increase the scope of his abilities . Obviously , they would facilitate the handling of any problem he set himself . Did he consider it right and necessary to make full use of every outlet he could ? Was his motivation so strong that other computers were taken to be merely rightful parts of himself  --  like the Master Beast ? No , he could n't  --  that would violate his well-defined sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; it would be stealing . But still  --  he had already used one other computer , the bank 's , just to send that postcard . And if he could use one , he could use them all . Why did n't he ? Or  --  Auberson felt cold at this  --  if he was going to take over any other computers , then it was too late  --  he already had . But ... Auberson shook his head . No , it did n't make sense to think of HARLIE as a menace . He had his own motives , yes  --  but he was too dependent on human beings to risk opposing them . This possibility had been discussed  --  many times  --  and HARLIE knew it . At the first sign that he was out of control , he would be disconnected . They would throw just a single switch and cut his power sources . There was no way he could sidestep it . The switch could be thrown right now , Auberson thought . He could do it himself  --  and thereby end the HARLIE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HARLIE , it would be permanent . Dome would never let him start him up again . No  --  HARLIE was not out of control . He could n't be-or was that just a rationalization ? No  --  if he were out of control , he would n't be responding like this . The problem was simpler . It had to be . HARLIE was merely exercising his capabilities . Yes , that was it  --  but was he aware of the necessary limits to those capabilities ? Limits not of electronic scope , but of human propriety ? Just what were those limits anyway ? What was the difference between tapping into the Master Beast of this company and the Master Computer of some other corporation ? No difference at all , really  --  both were invasions of privacy . The difference was in degree , not in kind . The limits were there  --  or were they ? If they were , would HARLIE agree that they were reasonable limits ? Would he accept them ? What if he refused to ? Well , then that would be proof @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that train of thought . HARLIE is not out of control . The question was : How did he relate to other computers ?  | Obviously , HARLIE was ( a ) aware of the vulnerability of other computers , ( b ) just as aware that he should n't take them over , ( c ) equally aware that their use would increase the range of problems he could handle , as well as the scope of his knowledge and sources of same  --  and ( d ) most likely he was also aware of all the extra processing time available on these machines that no one was using . It would not exactly be stealing to make use of that empty time  --  it would only go to waste otherwise . If the time was available , why not make use of it . After all , no one would know But it was wrong ; it had to be  --  Auberson was sure of it . HARLIE had no right to tap into another company 's computers , no matter what his reasons , no matter who knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was wrong , Auberson was sure of one other thing too . He 'd never be able to convince HARLIE of it . HARLIE did n't have morals , remember ? Only ethics . He could n't see that he was doing anything wrong . If no one was being hurt , how could it be wrong ? Auberson was n't even going to try to argue with that . Unless he could prove injury , or the possibility of such , he might as well give up . But something would have to be worked out . Some kind of limits would have to be imposed . And HARLIE would abide by them too , if he were confronted with the alternatives : i.e. , they would cut his tap into the Master Beast and his link to the outside world as well . It was only through the Master Beast that he could link up with other computers . He would n't like it , but he would abide by it . Or would he ? He might not tell them of any future indiscre-tionsBut on the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked . He would be . resentful , though , Auberson thought . It would seem illogical to him to let all that unused processing time go to waste . Yes , HARLIE 's point of view was understandable . I suppose , if no one else is using that time And suddenly it hit him : HARLIE had already covered this ground . He must have considered every aspect of it before he sent that postcard  --  including Auberson 's reaction . All that unused computer time  --  that was merely a resource to HARLIE  --  a means , not an end  --  one that could be tapped if  | needed , and only if he obeyed his own code of ethics in the process ? which meant that his limitations on it were already stricter than any Auberson might impose . HARLIE was way ahead of them . As always . He not only knew what his capabilities were , but what the necessary limits on them must be . But that postcard That was something else entirely . Auberson pursed his lips and typed : I AM NOT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HARLIE . IT IS NOT THE ABILITY , BUT THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU HAVE CHOSEN TO DEMONSTRATE IT . WHAT DO YOU MEAN ? I MEAN THAT YOUR REASON FOR SENDING THE POSTCARD TO ANNIE WAS NOT TO BE FUNNY  --  YOU HAD AN ULTERIOR MOTIVE . I DID ? YOU WANTED TO BRING US TOGETHER , DID N'T YOU ? YOU 'RE PLAYING MATCHMAKER , HARLIE , AND IT SHOWS . ONLY THIS TIME IT BACKFIRED IN YOUR FACE . DID IT ? I 'M BAWLING YOU OUT FOR IT , ARE N'T I ? I MADE ALLOWANCE FOR THAT IN MY ORIGINAL CALCULATIONS , HARLIE said calmly . I MADE FULL PROJECTIONS OF THE PROBABLE REACTIONS OF BOTH YOU AND MISS STIMSON , BASED ON THE INFORMATION IN YOUR CONFIDENTIAL FILES AS WELL AS ON KNOWLEDGE GAINED THROUGH COMPANY OPERATIONS AND FROM PERSONAL EXPERIENCE WITH BOTH OF YOU . WELL , TT WO N'T WORK , HARLIE . IT ALREADY HAS . OBVIOUSLY YOU TWO WERE TOGETHER AT LEAST LONG ENOUGH FOR HER TO TELL YOU ABOUT THE POSTCARD . DID YOU TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE OPPORTUNITY TO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ YOUR BUSINESS . AND YOU HAD NO RIGHT TO MANEUVER US INTO SUCH A POSITION . IF I DID N'T , WHO WOULD ? AND OBVIOUSLY , YOU DID ASK HER FOR A DATE , ELSE YOU WOULD HAVE SIMPLY SAID NO . I PRESUME SHE ACCEPTED ? YOU SHOULD THANK ME FOR IMPROVING THE QUALITY OF YOUR SOCIAL LIFE . DAMMIT , HARLIE , IF I HAD WANTED YOU TO PLAY MATCHMAKER , I 'D HAVE TOLD YOU . A REAL MATCHMAKER DOES N'T WAIT TO BE ASKED , said HARLIE.  | BESIDES , IN THIS CASE , THE MATCH HAS ALREADY BEEN MADE . I WAS ONLY TRYING TO HELP IT ALONG A LITTLE . I CAN HANDLE MY LOVE-LIFE WITHOUT YOUR HELP , THANK YOU . CAN YOU ? asked the typeI . CAN YOU REALLY ? Very slowly , very carefully , Auberson typed , YES , I CAN . THEN WHY HAVE N'T YOU ? THIS IS THE FIRST REAL DATE YOU 'VE MADE WITH STIMSON IN SEVERAL WEEKS . WHAT ARE YOU AFRAID OF ? I 'M NOT AFRAID OF ANYTHING . COP-OUT , accused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WANT TO DO THAT NUMBER AGAIN ? Auberson paused . Wednesday had been a trying day  --  very trying . Not unrewarding , but it had taken him almost all of Thursday to recover from the mental wringer HARLIE had put him through , and even today he was still feeling a bit twitchy . HARLIE , he asked . DO YOU REMEMBER WHAT STARTED THAT GO-ROUND ? HOW COULD I FORGET ? answered the machine . IT IS INSCRIBED INDELIBLY INTO MY MIND . MEMORY TAPES , YOU KNOW . Auberson ignored the implied sarcasm  --  if that 's what it was . He typed , IT WAS A QUESTION THAT STARTED IT , HARLIE . I ASKED YOU IF YOU KNEW WHAT LOVE IS . I 'M ASKING YOU AGAIN , NOW . IF YOU CAN ANSWER THE QUESTION TO MY SATISFACTION , THEN I WILL ALLOW YOU TO MEDDLE WITH MY SOCIAL LIFE . IF YOU CA N'T ANSWER THE QUESTION , THEN I WILL THANK YOU TO MIND YOUR OWN BUSINESS . AN , GOOD  --  A CHALLENGE . I ACCEPT . WHAT IS LOVE , EH @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WE WILL BEGIN WITH THE DICTIONARY DEFINITION . THE MOST COMMONLY USED SYNONYM IS " AFFECTION . " AFFECTION IS DEFINED AS FONDNESS , WHICH IN TURN IS DEFINED AS A LIKING , OR A WEAKNESS , FOR SOMETHING . LOVE IS A WEAKNESS ? Auberson was ready to rap out an answer to that , but something made him stop . He looked at the sentence again . LOVE IS A WEAKNESS ? The words hung before him in the air . A weakness ? How did HARLIE mean that ? Was he joking or serious ? Weak-ness ? A weakness could mean , yes , an affection  --  but it could also mean a hole in one 's defenses . ( Yes , love was definitely that , if one was still using the analogy of an ego putting up shells and walls around itself . Love , being an opening of those shells , would definitely be a weakness . ) But was it a good or a bad weakness ?  | The thought shimmered tauntingly . Was there something about it he had missed ? How did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ machine ? ( If machines could love , it would be . ) ( Or would it ? ) ( Yes , he decided , yes  --  it would definitely be a weakness to a machine . It would interfere with logical thinking . ) Weakness . He considered the word  --  eight soft letters of marshmallow black . He turned over its meanings  --  new ones kept suggesting themselves , new references and new contexts . He backtracked his train of thought , but the word had suddenly lost all semantic reference and become only two meaningless syllables , odd-sounding and flat . Weakness , weakness , weakness  --  it echoed and reechoed within his head . He let it . He repeated it over and over and wondered why the repetitions and examinations had drained it of concept . He thrust it away ; it did n't matter . It did n't fulfill the main criterion of his quest  --  it did n't satisfy him as a definition of love . THAT 'S NOT IT , HARLIE , he typed . And suddenly realized something  --  HARLIE had asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to suggest that definition for serious consideration . Then , if it was a joke , why did I take it so seriously ? Why did I consider it at all ? Why did n't I perceive it as a joke ? THAT 'S NOT A USABLE DEFINITION . THE DEFINITION I 'M LOOKING FOR HAS TO BE TESTABLE . AFFECTION , continued the machine , Is ALSO DEFINED AS AN ABNORMAL STATE OF BODY OR MIND , A DISEASE OR CONDITION OF BEING DISEASED . LOVE IS A DISEASE ? Auberson toyed with that one too , but only briefly . He thought of a virus , sometimes contagious , sometimes not . Some people are natural carriers of the germ , infecting many of those they come into close contact with ; others have a natural-born immunity . A love bug ? An intriguing thought NO , HARLIE . THAT 'S NOT IT EITHER . ALL RIGHT . WE 'LL KEEP TRYING . LOVE , ACCORDING TO MY DICTIONARIES , IS A STRONG FEELING OF AFFECTION . OR INFATUATION . INFATUATION SYNONYM IS GULLIBILITY , WHICH MEANS UNSUSPICIOUS OR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SYNONYM FOR PROBABILITY IS PROSPECT , AND A SYNONYM FOR PROSPECT IS SIGHT . A SIGHT IS A CURIOSITY OR PHENOMENON . HENCE , LOVE IS A PHENOMENON AS WELL AS A CURIOSITY .  | HARLIE , YOU 'RE PLAYING WITH WORDS . HARLIE ignored him . A CURIOSITY CAN ALSO BE CALLED A KNICK-KNACK . LOVE IS A PLEASING TRIFLE . THAT 'S NOT QUITE ACCURATE , HARLIE . LOVE IS NOT PLEASING ? HUMAN BEINGS DO NOT TRIFLE WITH IT ? HARLIE , YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN . *SIGH* typed HARLIE . Auberson stared . He 'd never seen him do that before . I GUESS SO . BUT I WAS TRYING TO DEMONSTRATE TO YOU THAT " LOVE " PER SE CAN NOT BE EASILY DEFINED . AT LEAST , NOT IN DICTIONARY TERMS . I NEVER ASKED YOU TO DO THAT , HARLIE . WHAT I WANT TO KNOW IS WHAT IS LOVE AS AN EXPERIENCE ? I WANT SOMETHING AGAINST WHICH I CAN MEASURE MY OWN FEELINGS AND REACTIONS SO THAT I CAN TELL IF I REALLY AM IN LOVE . THEN WHY , FOR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ARE YOU ASKING ME ? IT IS ONE OF " THOSE " QUESTIONS . AT LEAST , AS FAR AS I AM CONCERNED IT IS . I HAVE NEVER EXPERIENCED LOVE , AUBERSON  --  I WOULD LIKE TO , BUT I DOUBT I EVER WILL . I MAY BE HUMAN IN SCHEMATIC , BUT I AM TRAPPED IN A METAL BODY . I DO N'T KNOW WHAT THE PHYSICAL EXPERIENCE IS . HOW CAN YOU EXPECT ME TO GIVE YOU A STANDARD WHEN I 'M INCAPABLE OF KNOWING MYSELF WHAT THE EXPERIENCE IS . YOU 'RE RIGHT , HARLIE . I APOLOGIZE FOR PRESUMING TOO MUCH . I HAD ONLY THOUGHT THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE A PERSPECTIVE ON THIS THAT COULD SHED LIGHT ON MY CONFUSION . DO N'T ASK A LEGLESS MAN WHAT IT FEELS LIKE TO RUN . ALL YOU CAN ASK ME IS WHAT LOVE IS NOT , AUBERSON . I 'M SORRY . I SHOULD HAVE REALIZED IT , BUT I WAS SO WRAPPED UP IN MYSELF THAT I DID N'T . I UNDERSTAND . IT IS PART OF WHAT WE TALKED ABOUT EARLIER . YOU HAD @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ASKED ME . I GUESS SO . AUBERSON , YOU TELL ME WHAT LOVE IS . HUH ? YOU TELL ME . WHAT IS LOVE ? I DO N'T KNOW . IF I DID , I WOULD N'T HAVE HAD TO ASK YOU . YES , BUT YOU CAN TELL ME WHAT IT FEELS LIKE . YOU MUST HAVE SOME IDEA BECAUSE YOU ARE WONDERING IF YOU ARE IN LOVE RIGHT NOW , ARE N'T YOU ? YES .  | SO , WHAT DOES IT FEEL LIKE ? IT FEELS LIKE  --  I DO N'T KNOW . HARLIE , I MAY HAVE A TWENTYFOUR-HOUR FLU AND COULD BE FEELING DIZZY FROM THAT . I DO N'T KNOW IF IT 'S LOVE OR NOT . WHY NOT ? BECAUSE I 'VE NEVER BEEN IN LOVE BEFORE . YOU 'VE NEVER KNOWN YOU WERE IN LOVE BEFORE , YOU MEAN . NO , I KNOW WHAT I MEAN . I 'VE BEEN INFATUATED A COUPLE OF TIMES , AND I 'VE BEEN LOST AND CONFUSED A COUPLE OF TIMES , BUT I KNOW I 'VE NEVER BEEN IN LOVE . AND THIS DOES @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NO . YES . IT DOES AND IT DOES N'T . THAT DOES N'T HELP ME IN TRYING TO UNDERSTAND . WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE ? I DO N'T KNOW . I STILL HAVE N'T BEEN ABLE TO SORT IT OUT IN MY OWN HEAD YET . HM . YOU HAVE BEEN TO BED WITH HER THOUGH , HAVE N'T YOU ? A GENTLEMAN DOES N'T DISCUSS THOSE THINGS . YOU 'RE PUTTING ON YOUR MASK AGAIN , AUBIE . YOU DO N'T NEED IT FOR ME . Pause . He was right , of course . Answer : YES , HARLIE , I HAVE SLEPT WITH HER . AND ... ? AND WHAT ? AND , HOW WAS IT ? YOU WANT TO KNOW EVERYTHING , DO N'T YOU ? I NEED TO KNOW EVERYTHING . IT 'S PART OF MY FUNCTION . AND RIGHT NOW , I 'M TRYING TO HELP YOU . I CA N'T DO IT IF YOU HOLD BACK INFORMATION . HOW WAS IT ? IT WAS FINE . THAT TELLS ME A LOT . ARE YOU BEING SARCASTIC ? NO  --  BUT I 'M LEARNING @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ COULD INDICATE ITS UNSATISFACTORINESS . BUT IT WAS N'T UNSATISFACTORY , the words tumbled out . IT WAS VERY GOOD . I ENJOYED IT VERY MUCH . SO DID SHE . DID SHE SAY SO ? NOT IN SO MANY WORDS , NO  --  BUT I 'M SURE SHE DID . HOW ARE YOU SURE ? COULD N'T IT BE JUST YOUR MALE EGO NEED-  | ING TO FEEL VIRILE AND POWERFUL AND UNABLE TO ACCEPT THE IDEA THAT SOMEWHERE THERE IS A WOMAN YOU CA N'T SATISFY ? NO , IT 'S NOT THAT . SHE SMILED AT ME THE NEXT MORNING AT WORK . KIND OF A SECRET SMILE , AS IF WE WERE BOTH SHARING SOMETHING SPECIAL . DID YOU SMILE BACK ? YES . Pause . WELL , NOT RIGHT AWAY . FIRST , I WAS PUZZLED . THEN I SMILED BACK . DID SHE SEE YOU SMILE ? YES . HOW DO YOU KNOW ? BECAUSE SHE WINKED . IT WAS IN THE HALLWAY . WE WERE PASSING EACH OTHER , AND BECAUSE THERE WERE OTHER PEOPLE AROUND , WE COULD N'T STOP TO TALK . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ YOU HAVE SAID ? OH , I DO N'T KNOW . I GUESS I WOULD HAVE THANKED HER . THANKED HER ? AS IF SHE WERE SOME OBJECT THAT YOU HAD USED FOR YOUR OWN GRATIFICATIONS ? NO . I MEAN , I WOULD HAVE TOLD HER HOW MUCH I HAD ENJOYED THE NIGHT BEFORE . I SEE . Auberson waited for IIARLIE to respond further . He thought back to the morning in question , tried to remember the incident in greater detail . What color dress had Annie been wearing ? Green ? Had she been wearing perfume ? Yes , it had been that musky-sweet smell  --  a sense of sun and sand and sweet powder . Even now , he could detect a hint of it in the air , a subtle trace of her visit this morning . Abruptly , HARLIE asked , WHAT IF YOU HAD HAD TO APOLOGIZE TO HER ? HUH ? IF YOU HAD HAD TO APOLOGIZE TO HER INSTEAD , FOR WHAT REASON WOULD IT HAVE BEEN ? APOLOGIZE ? I DO N'T ? He stopped in mid-sentence as the thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He could remember it now , the hurt longing look on her face as he kissed her goodbye . THERE IS SOMETHING , IS N'T THERE ? prompted the typer . YES . I LEFT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT . SHE WANTED ME TO STAY  | ALL NIGHT , BUT I BEGGED OFF . I TOLD HER THAT I WANTED TO , BUT I 'D HAVE TO COME TO WORK EARLY IN THE MORNING AND I 'D NEVER GET HERE IN TIME . I FELT BAD ABOUT LEAVING . I ALWAYS FEEL BAD ABOUT LEAVING A GIRL IN THE MIDDLE OF ' 1'HE NIGHT LIKE THAT . IT MAKES IT FEEL LIKE ALL WE 'VE DONE IS GET TOGETHER FOR SEX ? AND ONCE I 'VE HAD IT , THE EVENING IS OVER FOR ME AND I CAN GO HOME . WHY DID N'T YOU SLEEP THERE ? DID N'T YOU WANT TO ? YES , I DID  --  BUT I HAD TO BE AT WORK IN THE MORNING . THAT WAS YOUR REASON ? YES . ARE YOU SURE IT WAS N'T YOUR RATIONALIZATION ? HUH ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SOURCE OF THOSE DOUBTS . YOU HAD TO REMOVE THOSE DOUBTS , SO YOU REMOVED YOURSELF FROM THE SOURCE . UNFORTUNATELY , AUBERSON , THE SOURCE OF THESE PARTICULAR DOUBTS ( AS EVIDENCED BY YOUR QUERIES TO ME ) CAN NOT BE THAT EASILY REMOVED FROM YOUR LIFE . AND LET ME ASK YOU THIS  --  DO YOU REALLY WANT TO REMOVE THAT SOURCE ? NO . I JUST WANT TO REMOVE THE DOUBTS . I WANT TO KNOW ONE WAY OR THE OTHER HOW I FEEL ABOUT HER . HOW DO YOU FEEL ? I DO N'T KNOW . YOU SAID YOU ENJOYED SLEEPING WITH HER . WOULD YOU ENJOY SLEEPING WITH HER AGAIN ? YES . PROBABLY . YOU 'RE NOT SURE ? HARLIE , YOU 'RE BADGERING ME . I DO N'T KNOW . I DO N'T KNOW . MAYBE YOU DO KNOW AND DO N'T WANT TO ADMIT IT . HARLIE , A LITTLE PSYCHOLOGY IS A DANGEROUS THING . I KNOW ENOUGH TO KNOW WHAT YOU 'RE TRYING TO DO . IT WO N'T WORK . THE AWARENESS OF A PSYCHOLOGICAL PRESSURE IS SOMETIMES ENOUGH TO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The computer was nonplussed . LET 'S TRY SOMETHING ELSE . WHAT DID YOU DO AFTER YOU EXPERIENCED ORGASM ? WHAT DO YOU MEAN ? DID YOU CONTINUE HOLDING HER AND STROKING HER , OR DID YOU ROLL OFF ? Auberson 's first reaction was to tell HARLIE to go to hell .  | Then he realized something else . I THOUGHT YOU SAID YOU WERE UNFAMILIAR WITH LOVE . I AM . I AM DRAWING NOW UPON THE EXPERIENCES OF OTHERS , DERIVED FROM NOVELS AND PSYCHOLOGY TEXTS . ALSO REFERENCE BOOKS ON SEXUAL TECHNIQUES . OH . SO WHAT DID YOU DO ? the machine queried again . DID YOU KEEP LOVING HER , OR DID YOU ROLL OFF WHEN YOU WERE THROUGH ? THAT 'S AN AWFULLY CLINICAL QUESTION . IT IS THE MOST IMPORTANT QUESTION . AND WHY DO YOU KEEP AVOIDING IT ? YOUR ANSWER WILL INDICATE YOUR FEELINGS TOWARD HER , YOUR REAL FEELINGS . HOW IMPORTANT WAS HER SATISFACTION TO YOU ? DID YOU STAY ON OR DID YOU ROLL OFF ? BOTH . BOTH ? IF I HAD AN EYEBROW , I WOULD @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FOR A LONG TIME . SHE HELD ON TO ME MOSTLY . I DID N'T TRY TO DISENTANGLE MYSELF . WHY ? DID YOU THINK IT WOULD BE IMPOLITE ? NO . IT FELT GOOD TO BE THERE WITH HER . AND BESIDES , SHE WAS CRYING . CRYING ? SHE BEGGED ME NOT TO HURT HER . I DO NOT UNDERSTAND . WELL , I THINK SHE 'S A LITTLE LIKE ME . SHE 'S BEEN HURT TOO OFTEN BY TOO MANY PEOPLE BECAUSE SHE 'S LET DOWN HER WALLS TOO MUCH . NOW SHE 'S AFRAID TO BECAUSE SHE 'S AFRAID THAT SHE 'LL ONLY GET HURT AGAIN . AND WHAT DID YOU DO ? NOTHING . I JUST KEPT HOLDING ON TO HER . DID YOU TELL HER YOU WOULD N'T HURT HER ? UM , NOT IN SO MANY WORDS . I THINK I SAID SOMETHING LIKE , " THERE , THERE , IT 'S GOING TO BE ALL RIGHT . " RATHER UNIMAGINATIVE . HARLIE , HUMAN BEINGS HAVE BEEN MAKING LOVE FOR THOUSANDS OF GENERATIONS  --  I DOUBT THAT THERE 'S ANYTHING NEW THAT ONE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CORRECT . THE ODDS FAVOR IT . ANYWAY . I STAYED THERE TILL SHE STOPPED CRYING . THEN I GOT UP AND WENT TO THE BATHROOM . AND WHILE I WAS IN THE BATHROOM , I DECIDED NOT TO GET BACK IN BED BUT TO GO HOME .  | I SEE . WHAT DOES THAT MEAN , HARLIE ? DO I LOVE HER OR NOT ? I DO N'T KNOW . WHAT DO YOU MEAN ? I THOUGHT YOU SAID YOU WOULD BE ABLE TO TELL BY MY ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION . I 'M SORRY , I CA N'T . YOUR ANSWER WAS TOO VAGUE , TOO MUCH IN THE MUDDLE IN THE MIDDLE . THINGS ARE NOT DEFINED IN INTENSITIES OF BLACK AND WHITE , BUT IN VARIATIONS OF INTENSITIES AND DIFFERENCES IN SHADES AND COLORS AND TEXTURES . I CA N'T TELL . THIS IS NOT AS SIMPLE AS I ( EXPECTED ) ( THOUGHT ) ( HOPED ) IT WOULD BE . I BEGIN TO UNDERSTAND YOUR DOUBTS , AUBERSON . LOVE IS A VERY COMPLEX THING . YOU THINK YOU DO AND YOU THINK YOU DO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BUT NOT ENOUGH EVIDENCE TO PROVE EITHER . RIGHT . SO WE ARE BACK WHERE WE STARTED , AUBERSON . WHAT IS LOVE ? I WISH I KNEW , HARLIE . I WISH I KNEW . Handley came up shortly before lunch , and the two of them adjourned to the company cafeteria . Auberson amused himself with something that resembled spaghetti and meatballs . Handley had a broiled hockey puck on a bun . Ketchup did n't help . Handley took a sip of his coffee . " Look , Aubie , before you begin , there 's something I have to talk to you about . " Auberson held up his hand to stop him , but Handley ignored it . " It 's about HARLIE , " he continued . " I think he 's out of control . " Auberson tried to cut him off . " Don ? " " Look , Aubie , I know how you feel about him  --  but believe me . I would n't be saying this unless I were sure . " " Don ? " " I first began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I got curious how he could print out and deliver so many . Then when I found he 'd printed them out on the spot , I ? " " Don , I know . "  | " Huh ? " " I said , I know . I 've known for some time . " " What ? How ? " " HARLIE told me . " " He did ? " " More or less , " Auberson said . " I had to know what questions to ask . " " Mm . " Handley considered that . More thoughtfully , he said , " Just how much do you know , Aubie ? " Auberson told him . He told how he too had become curious about the G.O.D . Machine printouts , how HARLIE had explained his ability to control the Master Beast and use any printout unit in the company , and finally how that meant one could converse with him from any magtyper or CRT unit in the system . " I can talk to HARLIE from my own office , " he added @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd been wondering why you have n't been down to talk to HARLIE this week  --  thought maybe you two were n't on speaking terms . Now I understand . " Auberson dabbed at a spot on his shirt . " Right . " He moistened his napkin in his water glass and dabbed again . " To tell the truth , it 's been kind of unnerving to realize HARLIE can tap into any console he wants . It 's like having him peering over my shoulder all day long . I 'm almost afraid to type a memo now  --  HARLIE 'll read it from inside the typer . " " At least he has n't rewritten them for you yet . " " Oh , no ? " Auberson told him about the company 's annual report  --  how HARLIE had been displeased at not being mentioned in it and reedited the tape while it had been in the magtyper composer . " All they needed was one usable printout for the offset camera  --  and HARLIE would n't let them have it . " " How did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She mentioned it in conversation , day before yesterday . Of course , when I found out , I made HARLIE put it back the way it was supposed to be and erase all evidence of his meddling . But still , if he can do it with the annual report , he can do it with any of the company 's documents . Suppose he got it in his head to rewrite contracts or personal correspondence ? Theoretically , it 's possible for him to order a million pounds of bananas in the company 's name . And it 'd be legally binding too . "  | " Mm , " said Handley . " Let 's just hope he never gets an urge for a banana split . " He took a bite of his sandwich and chewed it thoughtfully . " Still , it 's not as bad as it could have been . We discovered this in time to control it . " " There 's more , " said Auberson . He told Don about the postcard . The engineer nearly choked on his last bite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of water , and said , " Do you have it with you ? " Auberson pulled it out of his jacket pocket and handed it over . Handley read it silently . " Notice what it 's printed on , " Auberson said . " A standard bank form . " Handley nodded . " He reprogrammed the bank 's computer by telephone , right ? " " Right . " " I realized he had that capability when we wired him into the Master Beast , but I did n't think he 'd use it . " " Why should n't he ? Nobody told him not to  --  and even if we had , I doubt it would have done any good . You ca n't tell someone not to use part of his own body . " " Is that how HARLIE perceives it ? " " The Master Beast , he does , " Auberson said . " Other computers are merely a resource to be tapped as needed  --  when the time is available . " " Hm . " Handley finished his coffee , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frown . " One thing , Aubie , I do n't understand  --  why did he send the card in the first place ? " " Urn , he did it as a joke . " " A joke ? Uh uh , I doubt he 'd reveal a capability like this for a joke . And why through Annie ? " " The joke was n't on her . It was on me . Or actually , it was on both of us . " He gestured in annoyance . " There 's more to it than that . " Handley glanced at him sharply , decided not to pursue the matter . He waved the postcard meaningfully . " Anyway , this confirms something I 've been worrying about for a while . " " That HARLIE can reprogram any other computer he can reach by telephone ? " Handley nodded . " Do you realize what that means ? It means that HARLIE is effectively every computer in the world . " He de-  | cided to qualify the remark and added , " Or every computer he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I knew he could reprogram them , but ? " " Do you remember the VIRUS program ? " " Vaguely . Was n't it some kind of computer disease or mal-function ? " " Disease is closer . There was a science-fiction writer once who wrote a story about it  --  but the thing had been around a long time before that . It was a program that  --  well , you know what a virus is , do n't you ? It 's pure DNA , a piece of renegade genetic information . It infects a normal cell and forces it to produce more viruses  --  viral DNA chains  --  instead of its normal protein . Well , the VIRUS program does the same thing . " " Huh ? " Handley raised both hands , as if to erase his last paragraph . " Let me put it another way . You have a computer with an autodial phone link . You put the VIRUS program into it and it starts dialing phone numbers at random until it connects to another computer with an auto-dial . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Or rather , it reprograms the new computer with a VIRUS program of its own and erases itself from the first computer . The second machine then begins to dial phone numbers at random until it connects with a third machine . You get the picture ? " Auberson was delighted at the audacity of it . " It 's beautiful . It 's outrageous . " " Oh , yeah , " Handley agreed dourly . " It 's fun to think about , but it was hell to get out of the system . The guy who wrote it had a few little extra goodies tacked onto it  --  well , I wo n't go into any detail . I 'll just tell you that he also wrote a second program , only this one would cost you  --  it was called VACCINE . " Auberson laughed again . " I think I get the point . " " Anyway , for a while there , the VIRUS programs were getting out of hand . A lot of computer people never knew about it because their machines might be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two , but there were some big companies that needed every moment of on-time  --  even with time-sharing . After a couple of months , that VIRUS program was costing them real money . It was taking up time that somebody else should have  | been using . Because it dialed numbers at random , it might stay in one computer for several months and another only for several days . " " But there was only one VIRUS program , was n't there ? " " At first there was , but there were copies of it floating around , and various other people could n't resist starting plagues of their own . And somewhere along the line , one of them mutated . " " Huh ? " " Evidently , there was some kind of garbling during transmission , perhaps a faulty phone link or a premature disconnection . In any case , copies of the program started appearing that did n't have the self-erase order at the end . In other words , one machine could infect another and then both would be infected , dialing numbers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be infected . " " Not really ? ? " " No , " admitted Handley . " The VACCINE program took care of most of them . Although , to tell the truth , rumor has it that there are still a couple of VIRUS programs floating around loose , ones with an immunity factor . " " The whole thing is just crazy enough to be true , you know . " " Believe me , it is . Or was . Anyway , what I 'm getting at is this : There were a few people , programmers mostly , who realized that the VIRUS program was more than just a practical joke . For instance , why did it have to dial phone numbers at random ? Why not provide it with a complete directory of other computers ' phone numbers ? " " Where would they get that ? " " The phone company . " " Would they release such information ? " " You do n't even need to ask them . You feed a modified VIRUS program into the phone company 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assigned to computers , makes a list of them , then dials your phone number and injects itself and its stolen information into your machine , where you can examine it at leisure . " " Wow ... " whispered Auberson . " That 's not all . Once you have that list of phone numbers , you can tap into any computer you want , raid it for any information you want , and do it all without any possibility of being detected .  | Or , you could set the VIRUS program to alter information in another computer , falsify it according to your direction , or just scramble it at random if you wanted to sabotage some other company . " " I 'm beginning to see the dangers of such a thing . What would happen if somebody erased everything in the Master Beast ? " " Right . That 's one of the reasons the National Data Bureau was three years late in setting up its files . They could n't risk that kind of security breach , let alone the resultant outcry if the public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that easily tapped . " " Well , there must have been safeguards ? " " Oh , there were  --  right from the start  --  but you do n't know programmers , Aubie . Any system that big and that complex is a challenge . If there 's a fault in it , they 'll find it . They function as a hostile environment for computers , weeding out inferior systems and inadequate programs , allowing only the strong to survive . They force you to continually improve your product . If IBM makes a claim that their new system is foolproof , it may well be ? but if it 's not genius-proof as well , within a week one of their own programmers will have figured out a way to foul it up . " Auberson looked at him . " Why ? " " Is n't it obvious ? Purely for the sheer joy of it . They 're like kids with a big , exciting toy . It 's a challenge , a way for man to prove he 's still mightier than the machine  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cup , discovered it was empty , and settled for a glass of water instead . " It happened right here with our own Master Beast . Remember when we set it up , how we said no one would be able to interfere with anyone else 's programs ? Well , within two days the whole system had to be shut down . Someone ? we still do n't know who  --  had added a note of his own to the Memo-Line . It was titled something like Intersexual Procedures in the Modern Corporation . ' As soon as somebody punched for that title  --  and that did n't take long  --  the machine began hunting for the memo to accompany it . Of course , there was none , but the hunting procedure ( accidentally , it seemed ) triggered a go-tothe-next-function , repeat-previous-function ' loop . The machine started twiddling its fingers , so to speak , and immediately registered Busy , No Time Available ' on all its terminals . Well , we knew that could n't be possible  --  the Master Beast was designed  | to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ future growth  --  so we shut down the system and went exploring . You know , we had to write a whole new program just to prevent that from happening again . " " Hm , " said Auberson . " Anyway , I 'm getting off the track . What I was driving at is that you have no way of knowing about a flaw in your system until someone takes advantage of it . And if you correct that one , likely as not there 's still half a dozen more that someone else is liable to spot . The National Data Bureau is more than aware of that . Congress would n't let them establish their memory banks until they could guarantee absolute security . It was the VIRUS programs that were giving them their biggest worries . " " I can think of one way to avoid the problem . Do n't put in a phone link to the Data Banks . " " Uh uh  --  you need that phone link . You need it both ways , for information coming in and going out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " And the VACCINE program would n't work ? " " Yes and no . For every VACCINE program you could write , somebody else could write another VIRUS program immune to it . " " That does n't sound very secure . " " It is n't  --  but that 's the way it is . Any safeguard that can be set up by one programmer can be breached or sidestepped by another . " " Well , then , what did they finally do with the Data Banks ? " " Search me , " Handley shrugged . " It 's classified information ? top secret . " " Huh ? " " All I know is that one day they announced that they 'd solved the problem and could now guarantee absolute security of information  --  the National Data Banks are now in business . If I knew how they 'd done it , maybe I could figure out a way to get around it , so that 's why it 's classified . " " How do you think they did it ? " " Who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ key to breaking it would be to work- out the ultimate value of pi . You could connect with it , but you 'd never get any information out of the machine  --  your computer  | would be too busy computing an irrational number . Or maybe they have a complicated system of check-backs and ask-me-agains . Or maybe they have a thing which erases your program as it makes its requests . Or maybe they have some kind of program-analyzing function which automatically cancels out and traces back to its source anything that even remotely resembles an unauthorized program . I know that 's what a lot of lesser corporations have done . Or maybe they 've got a combination of all these things . The only way to program the machine is through a coded input  --  and the codes change every hour according to a random number table . Output is the same , except over the phone , where you need a special code key for your computer as well . " " Wow , " said Auberson . Handley shrugged again . " National security , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problem is that it 's very hard to maintain any kind of security system when anyone with a console and a telephone can tap into your banks . A lot of smaller companies with their own computers ca n't afford the same kind of really sophisticated protection . A skillfully written information-tapping VIRUS program would be very hard to distinguish from an ordinary request for information  --  especially if both were coming in over the phone . " " Could n't you classify certain information as not to be released over the phone ? " " Not if you want it retrievable . Aubie , anything you can program a computer to do , someone else can program it not to do . Or vice versa . " " Oh , " said Auberson . " Anyway , for the most part , most companies have protected themselves with analysis programs which hopefully weed out all unauthorized programs . " " You say hopefully ' . . . ? " " Well , most of them are based on a user giving the correct code signal when he punches in to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authorized user . If he does n't give the right one , the receiving computer disconnects . Most of the code signals are simple patterns or digit combinations . If somebody were really patient , he could keep dialing and re-dialing , each time trying a different signal . Sooner or later , he 's bound to hit someone 's recognition code . "  | " That sounds awfully tiring . " " It would be  --  but you would n't have to do it yourself . Once you knew what you wanted to do , you could write a VIRUS program to do it for you . " " So we 're back where we started ? " " Look , Aubie , the code-signal function is usually enough to dissuade the casual electronic voyeur  --  the person who gains access to a console and thinks it 's the magic key . But it 's like I was saying before  --  there is no system so perfect that there is not somewhere some programmer trying to figure out a way to trip it up . A truly determined programmer will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safeguards ? " " No , Aubie  --  there are safeguards . The thing is , how much are you willing to pay for them ? At what point does the cost of protecting the computer outweigh the efficiency gained by its use ? In other words , the value of a piece of information is determined by two factors . How much are you willing to spend to protect it ? and how much is someone else willing to spend to get ahold of it ? You 're betting that you 're willing to spend more than he is . A determined programmer might be able to break the National Data Codes , but that would mean he 'd have to spend at least as many man-hours and probably as much money breaking them as did the Federal Government setting them up . " " Why not just tap into a computer that already knows the codes or has the signals ? " " See ? " said Handley . " You 're starting to think like a programmer . Now do you see why they had such a devil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Auberson conceded the point . " Then that is n't a loophole , is it ? " " Uh uh . Apparently , it 's not the computer that hooks into the Data Banks , but the user . You can call in from any machine with an auto-dial if you have your card and code-key  --  but the machine you 're using does n't have to have any special programs at all . Probably , the banks temporarily reprogram any computer that taps in to perform the coding and recognition functions itself . You could monitor it if you wanted , but because the codes and coding programs are constantly changing , you would n't gain anything . The Rocky Mountain Center controls them all . If you  | personally are cleared , you can ask the Data Banks anything you want  --  that is , anything you 're cleared to know . If you 're not cleared , then no matter what computer or console you 're tapping in from , you 're going to be ignored  --  or arrested . " He added , " And that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Look , " said Handley . " If HARLIE got into the Bank of America 's computer , he must have broken their recognition code or tapped into the interbranch line . I did n't worry about this happening before because I figured the various codes in effect would be a deterrent to him . Apparently they were n't . Not only that , I 'd thought you could n't program a bank computer by telephone ; there were supposed to be safeguards  --  hell , it was supposed to be impossible . But HARLIE did it ; this postcard is proof . " He glared at it  --  its existence was an unpleasant anomaly . " It might have taken a human being a few hundred years to figure out how to do this . I 'll bet HARLIE did it in less than a week . " " I 'll ask him . " " No , I 'll ask him  --  I want to know how he did it . If he can do that to the Bank of America , think what he could do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ computers from a distance , he can put them all to work on one central problem  --  like for instance , breaking the codes of the National Data Banks . " " You think HARLIE would try ? " Handley pressed his fingertips thoughtfully together and flexed them slowly . " Remember when we were building him  --  how we kept calling him a self-programming , problem-solving device ? Well , that 's what he is . He 's a programmer , Aubie , and he 's got the same congenital disease every programmer has  --  the urge to throw the monkey wrench , if for no other reason than to see sparks . The National Data Banks are a challenge to him . To all programmers  --  but he 's the one with the capability of doing something . " " You do n't really think he ? " " No , I do n't think that he 'll get through . I do n't think he 's smart enough to outwit the unlimited brains and money of the government  --  hut unless we warn him off , we 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon . They can trace him back , you know  --  the banks not only list all calls accepted and the nature of  | the information exchanged , they also list all calls rejected and the reasons why . " Handley reached for his water glass , discovered it was empty , reached for Auberson 's instead . " That 's been used ? " " I do n't mind . " " I had a spot on my shirt , remember ? " Handley lowered the glass from his lips . " No wonder it tastes like a paper napkin . " He drank again , thirstily , and replaced the glass on the table . " On the other hand , let 's assume that he can tap into the banks . Immediately he has the power to throw this country into an uproar . All he has to do is threaten to erase them unless his demands are granted . " " So we turn him off ? " " Uh uh . Then for sure he 'd erase the banks . He could set a deadman 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've written self-destruct programs myself  --  only the continued monitoring of it with a do-not-implement-yet signal protects them . We would n't dare turn him off  --  we could n't even try . That 's if he gets in . But it 's not just the National Data Banks , Aubie  --  it 's every computer . HARLIE can reprogram them as easily as though they were part of himself . That 's dangerous power to have . " " Wait a minute , Don . You said unless we meet his demands . ' What kinds of demands do you think HARLIE would make ? " " I do n't know , " Handley said . " You 're his mentor . " " That 's just it  --  I know him . I know how he works . He does n't make demands , he makes requests  --  and if they 're not granted , then he works around them . He works to accomplish his goals through the path of least resistance . Even if he could take over the Data Banks , he would n't use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be to gain knowledge , not power . He 's a problemsolving device  --  his basic motivation is the seeking and correlating of knowledge , not the use of it . He only gets testy when we try to withhold information from him . At all other times he cooperates because he knows he 's at our mercy  --  completely so . You know as well as I , Don , that if HARLIE turned out to be a malignant cancer , we 'd turn him off in a minute  --  even if we did have to lose the Data Banks in the process . We could always recreate them later because the hardware would still be there . He 's got our memos in his files , Don  --  or in the Master Beast .  | He knows about all our discussions about the possibility of the JudgNaut getting out of control , and he knows about our contingency plans . The mere knowledge of what we could do if we had to is one of our best controls on him . " " But , Aubie  --  he has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likely to be used . " " I 'll concede the point . But HARLIE would rather use his power in such a way that nobody would know he was doing it . If HARLIE decided to build a new facility or a new computer , he would  --  but the people who implemented it would be thinking it was their idea . They would n't suspect HARLIE had a hand in it . " " Like the G.O.D . Machine ? " Auberson stopped , startled . " ? Yes , like the G.O.D . Machine . You 're right . " Handley nodded . " In either case , Aubie  --  he 's got the power and he 's using it . " " All right , what do we do about it ? " " I 'm not sure . If we put a lock on the phone , he 'll only figure some way around it . The only sure way is to pull his plug . " Auberson said , " How about we tell him not to do it any more ? " " Are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . " Serious . HARLIE claims to be an existentialist , that he 's willing to accept responsibility for all of his actions . We tell him that if he does n't stop , we 'll pull his plug . " " Aw , come on , Aubie , you know better than that . You 're a psychologist . All you 'll be doing will be forcing him to do it behind our backs . If nothing else , we want his actions where we can monitor them . " " But there 's no way he can hide it  --  he has to answer a direct question . " " Want to bet ? All he has to do is store his entire memory of any unauthorized actions in some other computer . If you ask him about it , he literally wo n't know . Periodically , the other computer would call up and remind him ' ? i.e. , give him back his memory . If he did n't need it , he 'd tell it to check back with him again after a given amount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need it , it would be right there where he could use it  --  but out of your reach . If he was connected and you started to ask him about  | something he did n't want to tell you , he could break the connection before you finished your question . Then , when he searched his memory for whatever you had asked about , it would n't be there ? he would have conveniently forgotten . " " Like a human mental block . " " But a very convenient one , " said Handley . " He can get around it ; you ca n't . " He finished Auberson 's water , replaced the glass . " It all comes back to the question of programming , Aubie . Anything we can tell him not to do , he 's clever enough to figure out a way around . " Auberson had to agree . " But , look , we can warn him off the National Data Banks , at least  --  ca n't we ? " Handley nodded . " We can try  --  but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to leave them alone  --  especially the ones he 's already tapped into . " " Urn , " said Auberson . He stared glumly into the wet rings on the formica table top . " You know , " he said , " I 'm not so sure we should .... " Handley looked at him , waiting . " It 's like this ? " Auberson explained . " HARLIE is already aware of the danger his power represents . He knows about our contingency plans . That knowledge alone ought to be enough to act as an inhibitor ? " " And what if it is n't ? " Handley asked . He shook his head impatiently . " Aubie , the power is there  --  he can use it . " " But ethically , he wo n't  --  at least , he wo n't abuse it . " " Can you be sure of that ? " Handley 's eyes were dark . " His sense of ethics is not the same as ours . Do you want to wait until he gets caught ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bank of America monitored their computer tomorrow and found HARLIE in it ? " Auberson spread his hands . " All right  --  what do we do ? " Handley was grim . " Lobotomy , " he said . " Now wait a minute ? " " Not the surgical kind , Aubie . Maybe I should have said reprogramming . ' We go in and examine all his tapes and programs by hand . We remove all knowledge of previous use of the phone link and set up an inhibition against using it in the future . " " We 'd have to shut him down to do it ? "  | " Right . " " ? and the Board would n't go for that at all . They 'd never let us start him up again . " " We can handle the Board . If we survive the meeting on Tuesday , we can survive anything . We can call it a reevaluation period or something and use that as a cover . " " But there 's something else , Don . If we did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him ? " " You 're the psychologist . " " That 's what I'm. getting at  --  it might change his whole personality . He 'd have no knowledge of what we 'd done , or what he was like before  --  but he also would n't be the same machine as before . The inhibition might work to make him feel bitter and frustrated . He might feel unaccountably cut off from his outside world , trapped and caged . The ability to act on his environment would be gone . " " That may be true , Aubie  --  but he 's going to have to be controlled . Now . While he 's still controllable . " " You 're right , " agreed Auberson . " Except for one thing . How do we know that he 's still controllable ? " Handley returned the stare . " We do n't . Do we ? " Auberson was more than a little upset when he returned to his office . He had a sick sensation in his groin and in his stomach . It was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it in the daytime . Mostly , it was a nighttime visitor , an ever-gentle gnawing at the back of the head that had to be always guarded against , lest its realization sweep forth with a cold familiar rush . It was the sudden startling glimpse over the edge  --  the realization that death is inevitable , that it happens to everyone , that it would happen to me too ; that someday , someday , the all-important I ( the center of the whole thing ) would cease to exist . Would stop . Would end . Would no longer be . Nothing . Nobody . Finished . Death .  | He had that feeling now . Not the realization , just the accompanying cold , the whirling sense of futility that always came with it . He felt it about HARLIE and about the company and about Annie , and for some obscure reason , he felt that way about the world . Futility . A sense that no matter what he did , it would make no difference . If he had thought that things were under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incredibly out of control and getting more so all the time . He sat morosely in his chair and stared at the opposite wall . There was a place where the paneling was cracked ; it looked kind of like a dog 's head . Or , if one considered it from a different angle , perhaps it was the curve of a woman 's breast . Or perhaps .. . Abruptly , a phrase suggested itself to him , a snatch of sentence , a few isolated words . It perfectly described his mood : " . . . sliding down the razor blade of life . . . " Yes , he realized with a shudder . That was it . Perfectly . And , he realized at the same time , he was not going to accomplish anything if he let a blue funk be the master of his day . The only way to get rid of it would be to lose himself in work . He turned to his typer and made a few notes concerning the upcoming board meeting , but then decided that these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He could have typed a call for HARLIE , but he resisted the temptation . For some reason he did not feel up to talking with HARLIE again today . Besides , he knew he would have to talk to him about the use of the telephone auto-dial , and that was one confrontation he wanted to avoid . Or would that be a cop-out ? He worried that one for a while and decided that it probably would be . But on the other hand , he needed time to prepare , did n't he ? Yes , he rationalized , I need time to prepare . I 'll come in tomorrow and talk to HARLIE about it . Or maybe Sunday . The plant was open all week long . Idly , he found himself wondering  --  what did HARLIE do on weekends ?  | Instead of a restaurant , they headed for his apartment . " When was the last time you had a home-cooked meal ? " she had asked . " Huh ? Oh , now look ? " " Listen , I know what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steak in the broiler and open a beer . " " I thought this was supposed to be my treat . " " It is  --  pull in at that shopping center there . I 'll pick up the fixings and you 'll pay . " He grinned at that and swung into the parking lot . Dusk was turning the sky yellow and the atmosphere gray . As they wheeled the cart through the package-lined and fluorescent-lit aisles , he realized that something about the situation was making him feel uneasy . As he usually did in cases like this , he tried to pinpoint the cause of his unease . If he could isolate it , then perhaps he might understand it and be able to do something about it . But whatever the cause of it was , it eluded him . Perhaps it was just a hangover from this morning 's malaise . Perhaps . But then again Annie was saying something . " Huh ? I did n't hear you . " " You mean you were n't listening . " " Same thing , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I was asking , Do you eat all your meals in restaurants ? " " Um , most of them . I do n't do much cooking . " " Why not ? " " I do n't know . Too much fuss and bother , I guess . " She reached for a package of noodles . " Beef Stroganoff all right ? " He made a face , and she replaced the package . " Have you ever had Stroganoff ? " " Uh uh . " " Then how do you know you do n't like it ? "  | He shrugged . " I do n't like things with noodles , that 's all . " " Spaghetti too ? " " Oh , spaghetti 's all right  --  but not tonight . " " Not in the mood for it ? " He shrugged again . He did n't feel much in the mood for anything . " I 'd rather have something light . " " Steak ? " she asked . Another shrug . " Okay by me . " " That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cart from him and wheeled determinedly toward the meat counter . He trailed after . The feeling of unease was becoming a sense of pressure . " I 've got an idea , " she was saying . " Roast . " He considered it . " Okay . " She pored over the plastic-wrapped rednesses , thick and juicy . Layers of beef , cleaned and cut and sanitized into sterile-looking shapes . The juice that seeped around the edges was blood . He imagined a mouth of sharp needle-point teeth tearing into the salty moist flesh . It was cold and raw . Finally she selected one and turned the cart toward the vegetable counters . " You know , " she said , " it 's really a shame they do n't make boys take home economic courses . You would n't know a good piece of meat unless you bit it , and by then it 's too late ? you 've already paid for it . " She selected a head of lettuce ; it too was plastic wrapped . " Go pick out some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moved through the store quickly , picking out some frozen vegetables  --  in plastic , naturally , boil them in the bag ? and also a bottle of wine , a hearty burgundy . For dessert , vanilla ice cream . " You know , " he whispered as they approached the checkout stand , " you do n't really have to go to all this trouble . " " Yes I do , " she said . " But I 'd be just as happy with a restaurant . " " But I would n't . David , " she said , " did you ever stop to think that I might want to cook ? How often do I get a chance to fuss over someone ? Now please , shut up and let me enjoy it . " He shut . He thought about it . Well , maybe she does enjoy cooking . Just because you do n't , does n't mean that everybody feels the same way . Maybe some girls like to play house ?  | Play house ! Yes , that was it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ husband , he realized with a start . The pressure swelled in his head . Stop it ! he told himself . That 's the clinical way of looking at it . ' When you 're involved in the situation yourself , you ca n't afford to be clinical . Or was that wrong ? When you 're involved in an emotional situation , maybe you ca n't afford not to be clinical . But that 's the whole problem , he realized . I 'm still analyzing everything I do . Why ca n't I just relax and enjoy it ? Why ? The pressure settled itself into the back of his head . He could tell it was preparing to stay for a long time . The cash register clattered and rang . He shoved the cart forward mechanically . " Why the long face ? " she asked . " Huh ? " " You 're frowning . " " No I 'm not . " " Want to bet ? " " I was just thinking , that 's all . " " Well , it looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " What for ? What were you thinking about ? " " Oh , I do n't know . Just about our different attitudes on things . You 're more of a homebody than I am . " " It 's an occupational hazard . I 'm a woman . " " I 'd noticed . " " I certainly hope so . " The clerk checked them out then , a steady pattering of packages and prices , punctuated by the electronic coughs of the register . " Nine forty-three , " she said . David Auberson handed her a ten dollar bill ; then , noticing there was no boxboy , he stepped down to the end of the stand and began putting the groceries into a bag . He was able to put them all into one sack and hefted it once to test its weight . He looked back to the clerk . " My change ? " " I gave it to your wife . " The clerk gestured at Annie . " Oh , we 're not ? " they both said at once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laughed . " Come on , " grinned David . The clerk turned to the next customer . As they exited into the neon-lit night , she said wistfully , " Mrs. Auberson ... " " Is that a hint ? " " Urn , sort of . I was just wondering , if there were a Mrs. Auberson , what she would be like . " " You 'll have to ask my mother that  --  she 's the only Mrs. Auberson I know . " He swung the car out of the parking lot and onto the street . Annie said , " I was n't thinking of your mother . " " I know . I was sidestepping the issue . " She laughed at that . But not too heartily . Once inside the apartment , she tossed her coat on his couch and followed him into the kitchen . " Let me unpack them , " she said , referring to the groceries . " You fix the drinks . " " Screwdriver okay ? " he asked , pulling orange juice out of the refrigerator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said . " Unless you know how to make a wallbanger . " " I do , but I think I 'm out of Galliano  --  no , here 's some . " He rummaged around in his liquor cabinet , pulled out two tall glasses and dropped ice cubes into them . A little vodka , then some orange juice " A little more vodka than that , " she hinted . ? a little more vodka , then a healthy jigger of the Galliano , a maraschino cherry in each , and a hasty stir . He handed her the drink and she pecked him on the cheek . A moment later she pulled away from the resultant embrace . " Urn , I have to finish putting the roast in the broiler . " " Broiler ? I thought you put a roast in the oven . " " Boneless shoulder , clod , " she explained . " Flat cut . You broil it . It 's quicker and it tastes as rich as steak . " " Oh , " he said . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . He took another sip . For a bit there was silence  --  only the tinkle of ice in their glasses , or the slide and scrape of the broiler pan in the oven as Annie adjusted the meat . She sampled her drink , then began shredding lettuce into a bowl .  | He said , " I think I may be setting a record . " " Oh ? What kind ? " " We 've been together for an hour or more now , and I have n't mentioned HARLIE once . " " You just did . " " Yes , but that was only to tell you I had n't  --  and I 'm not going to say anything more about him tonight . " Expertly , she sliced a tomato into neat little chunks . " Okay , fine . " He sipped his drink again . He found that he was enjoying this . There was a homey atmosphere about the scene , and he had a sense of  --  belonging ( ? ) . A sense of something  --  he could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She dropped a plastic pouch of vegetables into a pan of boiling water , fiddled with the roast a bit , then quickly set the table . She worked with a minimum of fuss and frills . She plopped the salad bowl before him . " Here , you toss . " " With my bare hands ? " She was already reaching for salad fork and spoon . She handed them to him , then put out the small salad bowls . Clumsily , he filled them . Before he had finished she was seated at the table , looking at him . She took a bit more of her drink , then said , " Want to eat your salad now , or wait a bit ? The meat needs another ten minutes . " " Oh , we can wait , I guess . " He stared across the table at her sea-green eyes . They were glowing as if translucent , as if there were tiny gems deep within them , catching the light and sparkling it . Her smile was warm and inviting , her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trust and love Love ? ? He was smiling too . He could feel it . She was beautiful . Her hair was a tawny red color , streaked with shiny gold , but with a hint of deeper brown . She lowered her eyes uncertainly . His steady gaze was almost disconcerting . She looked up . He was still looking , still smiling . A swallow to work up her courage , a cough to clear her throat . " Want to talk ? " she asked . " What about ? "  | " Urn , " he said . He finished his drink ; he did it to cover his hesitation . " What about us ? " " Am I pushing too hard ? " " Huh ? " " Lately , David , I 've had the feeling that , except for business reasons , you 've been avoiding me . " " Now that 's ? " " Well , not avoiding , " she said quickly . " That 's the wrong word to use . Let 's just say I 've had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me feel like I 'm forcing myself on you . " " That 's silly , " he managed to say . " Is it ? " He thought about it . " Well , I have been caught up in this Board of Directors thing , you know . " " I know  --  maybe I 'm just reading meanings ? " She got up from the table and went to the stove to take the vegetables out of the water . She dropped the hot plastic bag on the counter . " You know , " she said , coming back , then pausing over her drink , " I remember something I learned in school once  --  not in class , but from some friends . It 's the reason there 's more hate in the world than love . " " It 's easier ? " he offered . " Sort of . Let me explain . It takes two people to make a love relationship . It 's a positive thing ; both have to work at it . But it takes only one person to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hate or dislike . " He considered it . " Urn . Okay . So what does that have to do with us ? " " Well . " She paused . " Is our thing one-sided , or are we both working to make it work ? " He did n't answer right away , just looked at her instead . " You mean  --  do I care for you as much as you care for me ? " She returned his gaze . " Yes . You can put it that way . " He broke the contact first . He looked at his hands . " I ca n't answer that ? I mean , not in the way you want . " He looked around . " Is my briefcase here ? " " You left it in the car . " " Damn . I 'll go get it . " He started to rise . Her startled face  | stopped him . Reaching over , he grabbed her hand and gave it a squeeze . " There 's something I have to show you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it seemed to take forever . The apartment elevator was slower than ever to arrive . Its doors opened with a lackadaisical sigh . The trip down to the garage went at a snail 's pace . He was out the doors with a bound , half-running to his car . He banged his leg on a fender in his eagerness . He pulled the case out of the back seat and headed back for the elevator . Again he had to wait , and again it seemed to be deliberately taunting him with its lethargy . When he got back to the apartment , he was breathless . She had just finished cutting the meat into thin red slices . She looked up with a curious frown . " You did n't have to run . " " I did n't , " he gasped and sank into a chair . He held the case on his lap and flipped it open . Hastily he paged through the sheafs of printouts , looking for the one he wanted . He separated it from the rest , then dropped the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " Read this . " " Now ? " she asked . She was putting the tray of meat on the table . He looked at her , at the meat , at the printout in his hand , and finally at her again . Abruptly he burst out laughing . She did too . " Here we 've been waiting for over an hour for dinner , " he said , " and just as it 's ready , the first thing I want to do is talk about HARLIE . And I promised I was n't going to do that . " She took the printout from him , placed it carefully to one side . " I never asked you to promise that . I like HARLIE . " That surprised him . " You do ? " " Uh huh . I want to read it . " She picked up his briefcase and put it out of the way . " But you do n't even know what it is . " " You want me to read it , " she said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She smiled at him . He pulled his chair around to the table and smiled across at her . He waited till she was through with the bleu cheese dressing , then poured a liberal dollop of it onto his salad and spread it around . He took a forkful , then paused , hand in mid-air . She was still looking at him .  | Her eyes were glowing . Shining . Slowly , he lowered his fork . He was glowing too . Sharing food is an intimacy . Eating together in a restaurant is a sign of one level of trust , a public level of mutual acceptance . Hamburgers shared at a drive-in are even more intimate ; the food is being shared in a car  --  part of the personal territory of one of the participants . Even more intimate than that is the cooking and serving of a meal in one 's own home  --  it 's a sharing of the inner self , and you ca n't get any more intimate than that . They were in his apartment . His territory . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He had allowed her  --  no , wanted her to enter . He had provided the food ; she had prepared it . A sharing . An intimacy . In the unspoken language that human beings use to communicate with each other in the absence of words , she had just said , " I love you , David . " And now he looked back at her and said , " I love you too , Annie . " Only , he used words . He reached across and took her hand . " I can answer your question now , Annie . I do n't need HARLIE . I just Annie , darling , dear sweet baby  --  I love you . I  --  I 'm just realizing it now  --  I ? I ? " He stopped ; he had to swallow , but he could n't . It poured out in a rush . " Do n't you see ? I 've been wondering too if you cared for me in the same way or what  --  I ? I have n't been sure what love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still do n't know what it is , but ? " The glow was golden now . It filled the apartment . The walls reflected it back at them , warm and shining . She was beautiful in it . " Oh , love  --  lover ? " " I feel like I 'm bursting  --  there are n't any words for this , are there ? " She could n't answer . She could n't speak either . How they finished dinner , he was never able to say . And yet , at the same time , it was a meal he would never forget .  | They were in bed and he was poised over her . And still their eyes were locked . And shining and glowing . The bed was full of gasps . And sighs . And giggles . There was such an overflowing inside of him , such a surge of tension released . All this time , all this time , he had been wanting , wanting , it had been building , gathering like water impatient behind a dam . Somewhere in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dim recesses of his mind that he refused to accept . But it was there and it was part of him  --  the sheer animal delight in the joyous experience of sex and love  --  all tumbled together and laughing in the sheets . They paused to rest , to breathe , to share a kiss , to giggle together , to shift slightly , to kiss again . He bent down suddenly and kissed her eyes , first one , then the other . She looked at him as if seeing him for the first time , and her arms were tight around him . And tighter , her hands were grasping . " Oh , David ? " He held her and he held her and he held her and still he could n't hold her enough . He was exploding in joy ; he could neither contain nor control it . Her little soft gasps were sobs , and he knew why she was crying . He had to wipe at his eyes too . " Oh ? " she said , and kissed him . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kissed him again . " Have you ever seen anyone crying with happiness ? " He wanted to laugh , but he was crying at the same time , sobbing with joy and melting down into her . He was a chip of flesh tossed on a splashing sea of laughter and wet eyes and love . A pink sea , with foamy waves and giggling billows . Red nippletopped pink seas . " Oh , Annie , Annie , I ca n't let go of you , I ca n't ? " " I do n't want you to . I do n't want you to . Oh , never let go . Never . " " Never ... never . . . " he gasped . He was moving again now , onto and into her . A joyous thrusting  --  a shaft of velvet and a  | silken lining . He was sobbing as he did , sobbing with joy  --  and she was too . All the days of wanting and holding back , all those denials of the body and the animal within  --  all of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shining eyes , sparkling in rapture . At last he had someone , someone to share it all with . He had someone to hold , to love , to touch . And she did too . She moved with him , with love and with lust , the two blending into a whirlpool of colors and kisses . The caressing waves gathered them up , surging and crashing and gasping , sweeping them across a sweet sky of delight and at last leaving them gently on the shores of a sighing embrace . The waters lapped at the shore and gentled their touch , and their fingers strayed across the velvety landscape , exploring  --  familiar and yet always wondrous . He was holding her tightly . He could n't stop holding her . She sighed  --  a sound of pleasure . He echoed it and smiled . Tears were streaming down his cheeks . He laughed . And kissed her . And kissed her . And kissed her . They spent Saturday falling in love . Deeper in love . It began before either was awake , with an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with the purely animal reflex of erection , sliding forward , and he was onto and into her almost as reflex , so familiar was the desire . She eased onto her back , only slowly coming awake . He was aware now ; he was inside her , warm and exciting , a silken motion . She opened her eyes and looked at him . He paused in his motion . " I had the strangest dream , " she said . " I dreamed I was be-ing ? " " Shh , " he said . " Do n't wake me up  --  I 'm still dreaming . " And pressed deeper . She brought her legs up to help him . This time , instead of melting into the experience , he was to
