While " Zonians " fret , Panamanians prepare to move in <P> JUNK FOR SALE says the sign in front of the three-bedroom house for which Leigh DuPr pays the Panama Canal Co. $169 a month . A clerk in the company 's rate office , DuPre , 40 , is going home with his wife and four children after nine years in the Canal Zone . " We do n't want to live where there is no U.S. jurisdiction , " he explains simply . Janet DuPree ( no kin ) , 33 , a kindergarten teacher in the zone and granddaughter of one of the workers who helped dig the big ditch , betrays the festering bitterness of many of the 33,600 American Zonians . " I 'm not leaving my garden to some Panamanian , " she says . " Before I go , I 'm going to throw all my plants and rocks into the canal . " <P> The zone has long offered an almost idyllic playground-comfortable , secure living isolated from the social traumas afflicting either the U.S. or Latin America . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shangrila/ If your heart you wish to heal/ visit Panama , " runs a song in Panama Hattie , a Cole Porter musical of a generation ago . For 3,500 American employees of the Government-owned Panama Canal Co. , 9,000 G.I.s and 21,100 other family members , Uncle Sugar provides everything from commissary-and post-exchange privileges to bowling alleys and movie houses , swimming pools and tennis courts . At the same time , Zonians can not own their homes or go into business for themselves within the zone ; they are not even supposed to have guests in their homes overnight without permission - and can be fired and ordered to leave the zone within 30 days . <P> The Zonians ' basic objections to the new treaty range from chauvinistic to sentimental to mercenary . " There is no Panama C , anal , " says the message on the bulletin board of the Panama Pilots Association in downtown Balboa . " There is an American Canal in Panama . " <P> At the bar next door , senior American pilots speak despondently of the future . " It 's been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " but it 's getting more like a mirage with every passing day . There is no future , and the younger pilots know it and are getting out . " Most of the 202 pilots ( only two are Panamanian citizens ) doubt that they will be paid adequately after Panama assumes that responsibility - or that the canal will be efficiently run . <P> The current and probably last of the Canal Zone 's 17 American Governors , Major General Harold R. Parfitt , 56 , spends much of his time trying to persuade canal employees to stay on . He objects to the term " exodus , " but admits there has been " an increase and a trend " in resignations , even though most of the people could remain for the next 23 years under the agreement , working for the new " entity " that would replace the canal company until Panama gains full control . Says Pilot Marshall Irwin : " I do n't intend to work for a dictator . "             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
