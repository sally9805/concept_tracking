TO THE CAMPANILE s HOIRTLY AFTER HELEN MARIA moved to Berkeley I had received a few lines in her elegant , spiky hand . She was very busy , but as soon as she could have me down she would let me know . The weeks had passed without another word , but in late May , when I had given up all hope , she wrote again : " Terribly short notice , but what about this coming Saturday ? My parents have to drive to San Francisco in the forenoon , and they could drop you off on the way and pick you up when they go back around six .... " What had happened to our plans for a whole weekend ? With dinner at a restaurant and everything ? But I would not quibble ; a less than perfect visit was better than none at all . It was only a twenty-mile ride from Martinez to Berkeley , but it seemed endless to me . With wartime gas rationing , people did n't go driving very often , and when they did they liked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fidgeting in the back seat as we snailed along . Wearing my good Scotch-plaid dress , my Dutchboy bob neatly brushed . I watched the sun rise higher in the sky . I counted the cows we passed , looking for a group of thirteen to match my age . I looked at the Burma Shave signs . SLAP . THE JAP . WITH ... IRON ... SCRAP ... BURMA SHAVE . At our rate of speed I could read each sign about eight times . But finally we arrived in Berkeley , and drew up before a large brown-shingled house shaded by evergreens . Several girls were sprawled on the front lawn . One of them , wearing a casual print dress and no shoes , jumped up and came over . It was Helen Maria , smiling and slouched . I jumped out of the car , slammed the door , and stood beside her as her mother rolled down the window for a chat . Everything was fresh and green , the air fragrant with the cool smell of cut grass . I smoothed my hair and straightened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moved off . " Well ! " she said . " Marvelous to see you ! Come say hello to everyone ! " And taking my arm , she conducted me 68 swiftly across the lawn . " A little friend of my sister , " she told the others in passing , " Wants to see the campus . " Glimpsed faces as my hostess swept me on , up the steps , into the house . A little friend of her sister ? We hurried down a hall , the bare feet padding ahead , then up more stairs , and down another hall and up more stairs . " VoilA ! " She swung open a door . It was a true Parisian garret , slant-roofed and fascinating . But it was barer than her room at home , and messier , and there was no familiar smell of incense , and how could she say a little friend of her sister ? " Do you want to wash up ? It 's just down the hall . " " No . " Why should I wash up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her black-soled feet , which she was sticking into a pair of scuffed loafers . Slinging on a shoulder bag , she led me back out the door . " You missed lunch , but we 'll grab a bite on campus . " It struck me like a blow : her English accent was almost gone . And I hated the way she walked , with none of her old hauteur . but loose and slouched . Flow could she have changed so much ? I clumped sullenly behind her down the stairs , my dress suddenly cutting me unier the arms . Outside she once again led me briskly past her friends on the lawn . My mouth settled in a hard line . But down the street she said , " It 's really ? ; ood to see you , Suse ! " My name was Danish ind was mispronounced as Sooza by most ieople ; but Helen Maria always said it right : ieuseh . And her smile was so spontaneous , so night and unquestionable , that the little riend of her sister vanished from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I want you to catch De up on everything , " she went on , taking my irm as we walked . I looked over at her sideways , with excitenent . " Well , the big thing is that I 'm being utored in math by a very excellent tutor , and he says I 'm bound to get an A this term . " This was not strictly true , but Helen Maria 's ace lit up . " That 's wonderful ! " she exclaimed . I 'd given up all hope for you , but that 's miaculous . Although I 'm surprised your interest es in math , I should n't think you had a very iathematical mind . " do , though . I really like numbers , the way ley always come out one certain way because ley ca n't come out any other way . You know ' hat I mean ? " " Yes , quite . They 're reliable . Which , for me , xeludes the possibility of excitement . But cat 's no doubt my own shortcoming . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ear it . " The air was fresh and bright around us , and there were no soldiers anywhere , no sandbags or barrage balloons or black oil tanks , as there were in Martinez . Students on bikes pedaled lazily by , tennis rackets in their wire baskets , and from open windows floated soft strains of radio music , and bells were chiming melodiously in the distance . We passed through a big gate into a campus of sweeping green lawns and stately buildings . As we walked , Helen Maria began describing the history and function of each building . It was not very interesting ; I looked at the students instead . There were n't many to be seen on a Saturday , and because of the draft they were mostly girls , sunning themselves on benches or strolling around as we were . It was a sunny , peaceful scene , and I felt content just to walk along , thinking a little about Mr. Thompson , a junior high school teacher I was in love with , and a lot about lunch . In front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Main Library , constructed 1911 , I beheld a beard : small , white , pointed , attached to a hookladen old man with bicycle clips around his trouser legs . " A beard . Look . " " Professor Ford , our Shakespeare expert . Please do n't stare , it 's rude . " But the next moment she was staring herself ; then a radiant smile broke across her face . Coming out of the library was a young man in dark slacks and a white shirt , his jacket thrown over one shoulder , reminding me with a pang of the last time I saw my brother Peter . But though his eyes were as blue as Peter 's  --  even bluer , light and startling  --  his hair was jet black , combed straight back without a part , and he was much older than Peter , maybe twenty-five or - six , with lines around his mouth . A 4-F , or he would n't be here in college . With a grin making deep grooves of the lines , he came striding over and stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The two of them kept grinning and staring at each other . " So you are here today , " he said at last , speaking in thick guttural accents that made my ears prick suspiciously . " I 'm showing Suse the campus , " Helen Maria answered , still grinning like an idiot . " I think I mentioned yesterday she was Coin-ing ? " Yesterday ? That amazed me ; I thought from their expressions that they had n't seen each other for weeks . " Suse , " she was saying , " This is Egon Krawitz . And this is Suse Hansen . " At least she did n't call me a little friend of her sister . She must have gotten that out of the way yesterday . Egon Krawitz extended a large virile hand with which he shook mine warmly , sending a good-sized thrill up my spine . He was a person who looked directly at you , with great friendliness . His eyes shone . " Delighted . And you are having a nice visit ? You have seen the Campanile ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back my tingling palm . " What 's the Campanile ? " " Ah , then we shall take you there , " he smiled as the three of us walked on . Egon Krawitz was solid and tanned , not like a 4-F at all . His features were large , well formed , and his light blue eyes and jet black hair made a striking contrast , and there was something magnificent about him , something polished and exceptional , foreign . Krawitz , I mused as we walked ; it was not German , of that I felt sure . It could he anything , Polish , Czech , Russian . And as we strolled , Helen Maria between us , I curled my fingers in and touched my palm , suddenly feeling  --  not only toward Helen Maria , but toward Mr. Thompson as well  --  a pang of treachery , a darkly immoral yet not unpleasant feeling ; and I cast lowered , sidelong glances to my left , trying to see around the harrier of my hostess . We never reached the Campanile , whatever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we strolled up sunny walks and down dusty paths , through stone archways and over broad lawns , and they walked with their arms around each other and talked so that I could n't hear . I was hungry . I loathed their private tones . My dress was too short , too small , hideous . Then suddenly Helen Maria recalled my existence . " Tell Egon how good you are in math , Suse . " I gave a sullen shrug . " It is your field , mathematics ? " asked Egon . I nodded , feeling less sullen . " Not only that , but she reads Flaubert . Tell Egon how many times you 've read Madame Bovary . " " Five , " I murmured , blushing with pleasure at his rich , foreign exclamation of approval . And at that heady moment I realized that our endless wandering had had a destination , and that we had arrived . T WAS THE OUTDOOR TERRACE of a campus / restaurant , filled with sunny cafe tables and the pleasant sound of voices and clinking china @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ familiarity , I even recognized one of the diners : Professor Ford of the beard and bicycle clips , forking up a carrot salad . I smiled at him , and as we sat down at a nearby table I looked with confidence at Egon . Professor Ford 's field was Shakespeare , mine was mathematics . " And what 's your field , Egon , if I may ask ? " " Political science . " " 1 think that sounds very interesting . " He nodded agreeably , picking up his menu . " Useless , probably , but interesting . But tell me , " he said , and the blue eyes looked warmly across the table , " how is it that this little town of yours produces such unusual young scholars as I lelen Maria and yourself ? " I glanced horror-stricken at Helen Maria , but she only smiled , lighting a cigarette , not at all insulted that he should be putting me in her class . " I really do n't know , " I murmured with embarrassment , taking up my menu @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to my liking , but it was not what an unusual young scholar would order , especially with Professor Ford looking over at me now and then , stroking his beard . We had salad , tuna sandwiches , and coffee , and while we ate everything went wrong again . They talked in German . I had heard enough movie Nazis to know . A harsh , nasty language , as if they had sore throats . Shamefully , my eyes went around the terrace , but no one was listening . Returning to my food , I chewed ignored and unhappy , listening to the horrible language , my eyes on the pair . Their eyes were on each other ; when one chewed the other talked , and sometimes they both talked at once , and laughed . I clattered my fork , I set my cup down resoundingly , there was no reaction ; I might have been air , and it was my day , my visit . With a mental slash I disowned the tingle of his handshake , a dirty Axis thrill  --  she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was shameless , you could see she had her hand on his knee under the table . When 1 was finished , I sat back and folded my arms in a large gesture . This had an effect . Egon looked over at me . " Ah , see how rude we have been . Here Suse has finished already . You have enjoyed it ? Good ! " And settling back in his chair , he gave me his attention . " Do you know , I wish you would tell me something about Madame Bo-vary , for I read it so long ago I have forgotten it . " Blankness and terror . Those blue shining eyes . Helen Maria sipping her coffee . I had only one wish , that they would ignore me again . " Well ? " said Helen Maria . Under the table , my feet came nervously together . " Well , Flaubert was an unvarnished realist ... he was n't romantic , romantics are sloppy thinkers , he did n't like them ... he did n't even like Madame Bovary too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he really hated was the priests and notaries , and so did she , because they stifled her . And so she took poison ? " Vainly I racked my brain for more details . " ? it 's beautifully written . " " I am relieved to hear it , " said Egon , and smiled . " Well , I must reread it now , upon your recommendation . " My heart flew to him . And Helen Maria , . . sipping her coffee , seemed pleased with what I had said . My eyes darted to Professor Ford , who was raising a spoon of red Jell-0 , and raising his eyes , too , which met mine with depths of silent congratulation . It would have been a perfect moment if only Egon were n't a German . But my mind was spiraling with ac-II complishment , and now I realized that he probably spoke several languages , as Helen Maria herself did , and that two such linguists might speak anything at random , German , French , ancient Greek . It did n't mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After all , no German would be at an American , an enemy university . He was from Poland , Czechoslovakia , or Russia . I put my money on Russia . " Where are you from , Egon . if I may ask ? " " Berlin . " I dropped my eyes . Berlin . The black heart of the Reich . He went on , not even lowering his voice as the waitress came over and poured more coffee . " That is to say , Dahlem , it is a suburb of Berlin , and a very pleasant one . It is very much like Berkeley , with all its trees ? " The waitress moved off . 1 could hear Professor Ford 's spoon clinking in his dish as he listened . 4 ' ? not that Berlin is old , in the sense of Nuremberg or Cologne , but it is a very beautiful city , nevertheless .... " " It is n't anymore , " I said coldly , looking ? up . " It 's been bombed a hundred and twenty-seven times . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Egon , " Helen Maria said , " please do n't let her get started on the war . She 'll never stop . " " A young lady of so many interests , " he remarked , brightening again . " That is unusual , to know the exact number of raids on Berlin . " 1 " I read the papers . And there 's going to be an invasion . Then your whole Germany will be wiped out . Totally . " " Will you please get off your hobbyhorse ! " Helen Maria snapped , and turned to him . " All Japanese are spies , and all Germans are Nazis . You have n't had to listen to it for years . It becomes boring in the extreme . " I felt a rush of resentment , looking at her annoyed , superior face . She had no under standing of war . She had never imagined , as I bad , what it was like to be blown up in your cellar ; she did n't think about that Polish family in Life magazine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't have a soldier brother in England . waiting to go in with the invasion . She knew nothing except that place she once mentioned , Verdun , where the two sides threw down their guns at Christmas and played soccer together  --  as if they did n't even hate each other , as if war had no meaning . She would n't care if Egon were Hitler . She had no inkling of anything . How dare she sit there insulting me because I did know something and was honest ? But Egon himself seemed amused . " No , Suse , " he said , " I 'm afraid you 're a bit off the mark . For I happen to be a Jew . " Jew . Though lie said it casually , it seemed to be a word that took care of everything , and Helen Maria looked from his face to mine with a righteous air . - And now , " she said , " I for one would like to talk about something else . " " I never said anything about Nazis . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? You 're always doing that . It 's unfair . " " We 're dropping the subject . " She spoke quietly , even pleasantly . You could tell she wanted everything to be smooth and nice . A woman was cooling up the steps waving at us . " It 's true , " I told Egon . " I never thought you were a Nazi . " Ile nodded , as if he believed me . But what was a Jew ? From Sunday school they were mixed up with bulrushes and date palms , and that 's where they were , in the Bible . I did n't know they still existed . But here was Egon . Hoa did he fit in with Germany up in the north ? How could he be from Berlin and the bulrushes both ? T HE WOMAN HAD PULLED UP a chair and flopped down , vigorously shaking hands with Egon and Helen Maria . Her face was plump and smooth , with sharp brown eyes , her thick brown hair swept carelessly into a bun , her heavy figure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She must be a refugee . Helen Maria told me about them once ; she said there were a lot of them at the university , and that they had gotten out of Europe before the war , and that the women had buns and burning eyes . Even though I could n't figure how you could have refugees without a war , I was looking with my naked eyes at a refugee . " My cousin Ruth , " Egon introduced us , and I realized that if they were cousins that she must be a Jew , too , and that Jews must be refugees , and Egon must also be a refugee . Things seemed to be fitting together . Her handshake was more violent than her cousin 's , and her accent harsher . " So , you are visiting the campus . You have been to the Campanile ? " " Not yet . " " You must . A splendid view . Atemberaubend ! " She reached over and pulled a cigarette from Helen Maria 's pack of wartime Fleetwoods . " Dreck , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and began conversing in Cennan . The sunlight was still warm on my tight plaid shoulders , but as my eyes wandered around the terrace 1 saw that the tables cast long shadows , and that Professor Ford had gone , leaving behind only a crumpled napkin that cast its own long blue shadow . The day was slipping away . I sank my chin into my hand but no one noticed . I wondered if Egon knew that Helen Maria 's feet were dirty inside her shoes . I wondered if anyone was ever going to order dessert . I wondered how long they were going to sit there using up my visit without a glance in my direction . I was n't just anyone to be treated so shabbily . I was a mathematics scholar , I read Flaubert , and not only did I know the exact bombing score on Berlin , but on Hamburg and Bremen as well . I heard a pause in Ruth 's loud voice and took my hand confidently from my chin . " Are you a Jew , Ruth . if 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down . " What does she say ? " " Who knows ? " said Helen Maria lightly , but her eyes slitted dangerously across the table at me . Once more my feet came nervously together . " Why do you wish to know ? " Ruth asked , and her sharp brown eyes were unpleasant . managed to say , with a shrug , " Just curious , " but to my alarm , the unpleasant look deepened . " We have here a young lady of many interests , " came Egon 's voice , calm and even genial . " What is it exactly you wish to know ? " Helen Maria 's eyes closed . But Egon 's tone gave me courage . 1 would ask something that could not possibly make Ruth 's eyes more unpleasant , and which would also show that I already knew a thing or two . " Well , I would like to know what year you got out before the war . " " What year ? " said Egon . " Late in ' thirty-eight . You have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind ice , snow , crystal stars . German Christmas Eve . I nodded . " So you know , then . Jews were beaten and arrested . shops and synagogues were de-stroyed . " And on Christmas Eve , that was horrible . Did it happen every Christmas Eve , a monstrous German custom ? And had Egon himself been beaten and arrested ? And Ruth ? Ruth I did n't care about , let them beat her . But Egon ... I felt a surge of anger . " I 'd like to beat them , did n't anybody beat them ? " " A little difficult , under the circumstances , " he said dryly , and even smiled , but it seemed that as he spoke , a memory of the purest loathing flicked across his face and was gone . " 1 think it 's horrible that they do it on Christmas Eve . " " Christmas Eve ? " " Crystal Night .... " But even as I spoke , I realized with a cringe of my toes that I had misunderstood and had now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all surprised by this . " No , that is not quite it , " he explained . " There is no connection between Christmas Eve and Crystal Night , though I see that it may sound that way . " Helen Maria was calmly finishing her salad ; she seemed relieved . As for Ruth , she had sat silent all this time , puffing ffin. on her cigarette . She no longer looked unpleasant , she did n't even look interested . She blew out a stream of smoke and looked at Egon . " Do you always air the matter to school-children ? " " Not always . " " It is in poor taste . " have poor taste . " But to me she seemed the one with poor taste , with her straggling bun and loud voice , and the way she took cigarettes without asking . But she seemed in a better frame of mind now , so I asked , " Are you from Berlin , too ? " And to point out my knowledge of the city , I added , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she snapped , grinding out her cigarette and glancing at her watch . " Dahlem , I am afraid not . I am not quite so grand . Do you always ask so many questions ? I pity your teachers . " She stood up and shook hands with the others , then turned and shook hands with me , too , and surprised me with a brief pleasantry . " I hope you will enjoy fully the Campanile . " I watched her go down the steps with her straggling bun . I did not really dislike her , and I hoped she had not been beaten . " I must go too , " said Egon . My heart sank at this , but Helen Maria said we would walk with him part way , and then he and I were left alone while she went to the ladies ' room  --  a place I needed badly to visit 72 myself , but for which I was not willing to give up this private moment . I T WAS HE WHO SPOKE FIRST . He asked if I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and confided that summer was my favorite season . He said it was his , too , and this , I felt , was something special between us , a bond . I asked if he liked America , and he said yes , although it was , well , very different of course . I asked if his family was here , too . He said his mother was in New York , but his two older brothers were still in Germany . His father had died a few years after the war . " Was that the first world war ? " He nodded . " Helen Maria insists they played soccer together at Verdun , the enemies together . " I watched for a scowl of denial No scowl appeared . " Verdun ? No . But things like that happened at other places . Serilis , for instance . " And to this crushing reply , he added , " My father spoke of it . Or so they tell me ; I was too young when he died to have heard about his experiences . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He fought in ? the war ? " He nodded . " He won the Iron Cross , First Class . " And just as a flicker of loathing had crossed his face earlier , a flicker of pride crossed it now . I looked down . He was the enemy after all , with his passion for Berlin where the Fuehrer raved from a balcony , and with his father slaughtering Yanks in the mud and getting the Iron Cross for it ; but why would his father who was a Jew fight for the Germans , who beat up Jews ? And why did they beat them up ? And how were they from the Bible and Germany both ? My brain creaked with confusion . I had an eleven-year-old math tutor , and all I had said about Madame &wary; was what Helen Maria had once said , and Professor Ford did n't know I existed , not even when he raised his spoon of red Jell-O . " I do n't know anything , " I confessed , looking up tiredly . " I do n't even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not look surprised . " Well , it is no disgrace . I think you consider it a disgrace not to know everything . You know quite a lot of things . I would have no worries ; it will all come , by and by . " Helen Maria was returning across the terrace . " And the Jews ? ? " I asked . " ? have a long and complicated history . " " I knew it must be complicated . " " More complicated ? " And as he stood up in the slanting sunlight I was again struck by the contrast between the jet black hair and light blue eyes " ? than you can ever imagine . " We walked back along the deserted campus . The sidewalks and benches shone with an . aching gold , filling me with melancholy , with -a sense of sun-sinking journeys . I thought of Peter in England , waiting for the invasion to begin . I thought of the Polish family lying dead in their potato field , and of bombed cities standing in twilight , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On the street Egon shook my hand . " It has been a pleasure , Suse . " " Me too , " I said , standing bereft as he took his hand away . " See you at seven , " he waved at Helen Maria , and started down the street . My eyes flashed from his back to her face . " I have to go to the bathroom ! " " You should have come with me.at the restaurant , " she said , heading for a gas station . " Well I did n't ! " " Are you angry about something ? Is it because I was sharp with you at the table ? " See you at seven ! . While I was snailing through the evening hills , they would be going out together , talking and laughing ! " I 'm sorry , but you bring it on yourself . I never know what you 'll say in front of people , you 're such a mass of peculiar ideas . " Running off together as soon as they got rid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visit ! " But it all turned out fine . And Egon liked you , he liked you very much , I could tell . " She spoke with real pleasure , with no jealousy at all , swelling my wrath to a peak . " I 'll wait for you over there , " she said , pointing at a bookstore . I slammed the rest-room door behind me . Just like her , could n't even wait , had to run off to a bunch of books . But when I joined her there it was to he presented with a gift , a scholarly volume called Principia Mathematica , by someone called Whitehead Russell . As she placed it in my hands , there was on her face that same spontaneous smile , that same warmth and interest that had made me so happy earlier . " You wo n't understand it now , " she said , " but at some point , if you go on to higher levels , the numbers will stop being reliable , and that 's when you 'll want to read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for I knew her look was real , as real as Egon 's blue and shining gaze . But in neither of them did it last , and that was real too . There was some gap between me and them , some distance so wide and deep and impassable , that I felt tired in all my bones , and was almost glad to be going home . ?
