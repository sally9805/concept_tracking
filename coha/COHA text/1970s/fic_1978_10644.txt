Ken FollettEYE OF THE NEEDLE 41of the hill at the eastern end of the island , close to the splintered stub of the broken walking-stick . It crowns the hill , defying the wind and the rain , not out of bravado but so that the man can see the sheep . There is another house , very similar , ten miles away at the opposite end of the island near the more-or-less beach ; but nobody lives there . There was once another man . He thought he knew better than the island ; he thought he could grow oats and potatoes and keep a few cows . He battled for three years with the wind and the cold and the soil before he admitted he was wrong . When he had gone , nobodywanted his home . This is a hard place . Only hard things survive here : hard rock , coarse grass , tough sheep , savage birds , sturdy houses and strong men . It is for places like this that the word " bleak " has been invented . " It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think you 're going to like it . " David and Lucy Rose sat in the prow of the fishing boat and looked across the choppy water . It was a fine Novemberday , cold and breezy yet clear and dry . A weak sun sparkled off the wavelets . " I bought it in 1926 , " Papa Rose continued , " when we thought there was going to be a revolution and we 'd need somewhere to hide from the working class . It 's just the place for a convalescence . " Lucy thought he was being suspiciously hearty , but she had to admit it looked lovely : all windblown and natural and fresh . And it made sense , this move . They had to get away from their parents and make a new start at being married ; and there was no point in moving to a city to be bombed , not when neither of them was really well enough to help ; and then David 's father had revealed that he owned an island off the coast of Scotland , and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sheep , too , " Papa Rose said . " Shearers come over from the mainland each spring , and the wool brings in just about enough money to pay Tom McAvity 's wages . Old Tom 's the shepherd . " thorny , that provide homes for rabbits ; and a brave stand of conifers on the leeward slope of the hill at the eastern end . The higher land is ruled by heather . Every few years thei man  --  yes , there is a man here  --  sets fire to the heather , and then the grass will grow and the sheep can graze here too ; but after a couple of years the heather comes back , God knows from where , and drives the sheep away until the man burns it again . The rabbits are here because they were born here ; the sheep are here because they were brought here ; and the man is here to look after the sheep ; but the birds are here because they like it . There are hundreds of thousands of them : long-legged rock pipits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they dive like a Spitfire coming at a Messerschmidt out of the sun ; corncrakes , which the man rarely sees , but he knows they are there because their bark keeps him awake at night ; ravens and carrion crows and kittiwakes and countless gulls ; and a pair of golden eagles that the man shoots at when he sees them , for he knows  --  regardless of what naturalists and experts from Edinburghmay tell him  --  that they do prey on live lambs and not just the carcasses of those already dead . The island 's most constant visitor is the wind . It comes mostly from the northeast , from really cold places where there are fjords and glaciers and icebergs ; often bringing with it unwelcome gifts of snow and driving rain and cold , cold mist ; sometimes arriving empty-handed , just to howl and whoop and raise hell , tearing up bushes and bending trees and whipping the intemperate ocean into fresh paroxysmsof foam-flecked rage . It is tireless , this wind , and that is its mistake . If it came occasionally it could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but because it is almost always here , the island has learned to live with it . The plants put down deep roots , and the rabbits hide far inside the thickets , and the trees grow up with their backs ready-bent for the flogging , and the birds nest on sheltered ledges , and the man 's house is sturdy and squat , built with a craftsmanship that knows this old wind . This house is made of big grey stones and grey slates , the color of the sea . It has small windows and close-fitting doors and a chimney in its pipe end . It stands at the to Ken Follett " How old is he ? " Lucy asked . " Good Lord , he must be  --  oh , seventy ? " " I suppose he 's eccentric . " The boat turned into the bay , and Lucy could see two small figures on the jetty : a man and a dog . " Eccentric ? No more than you 'd be if you 'd lived alone for twenty years . He talks to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the small boat . " How often do you call ? " " Once a fortnight , missus . I bring Tom 's shopping , which isna much , and his mail , which is even less . You just give me your list , every other Monday , and if it can be bought in Aberdeen I 'll bring it . " He cut the motor and threw a rope to Tom . The dog barked and ran around in circles , beside himself with excitement . Lucy put one foot on the gunwale and sprang out on to the jetty . Tom shook her hand . He had a face of leather and a huge pipe with a lid . He was shorter than she , but wide , and he looked ridiculously healthy . He wore the hairiest tweed jacket she had ever seen , with a knitted sweater that must have been made by an elderly sister somewhere , plus a checked cap and army boots . His nose was huge , red and veined . " Pleased to meet you , " he said politely , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first human face he had seen in fourteen days . " Here y'are , Tom , " said the skipper . He handed two cardboard boxes out of the boat . " No eggs this time , but there 's a letter from Devon . " " It 'll be from ma niece . " Lucy thought , That explains the sweater . David was still in the boat . The skipper stood behind him and said , " Are you ready ? " Tom and Papa Rose leaned into the boat to assist , and the three of them lifted David in his wheelchair on to the jetty . " If I do n't go now I 'll have to wait a fortnight for the next bus , " Papa Rose said with a smile . " The house has been done up quite nicely , you 'll see . All your stuff is in there . Tom will show you where everything is . " He kissed Lucy , squeezed David 's shoulder , and shook Tom 's hand . EYE OF THE NEEDLE 43 " I I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ completelyfit , then come back ; there are important war jobs for both of you . " They would not be going back , Lucy knew , not before the end of the war . But she had not told anyone about that yet . Papa got back into the boat . It wheeled away in a tight circle . Lucy waved until it disappeared around the headland . Tom pushed the wheelchair , so Lucy took his groceries . Between the landward end of the jetty and the cliff top was a long , steep , narrow ramp rising high above the beach like a bridge . Lucy would have had trouble getting the wheelchair to the top , but Tom managed without apparentexertion . The cottage was perfect . It was small and grey , and sheltered from the wind by a little rise in the ground . All the woodwork was freshly painted , and a wild rose bush grew beside the doorstep . Curls of smoke rose from the chimney to be whipped away by the breeze . The tiny windows looked over the bay . Lucy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been cleaned and aired and painted , and there were thick rugs on the stone floors . It had four rooms : downstairs , a modernized kitchen and a living room with a stone fireplace ; upstairs , two bedrooms . One end of the house had been carefully remodeled to take modern plumbing , with a bathroom above and a kitchen extension below . Their clothes were in the wardrobes . There were towels in the bathroom and food in the kitchen . Tom said , " There 's something in the barn I 've to show you. , , It was a shed , not a barn . It lay hidden behind the cottage , and inside it was a gleaming new jeep . " Mr. Rose says it 's been specially adapted for young Mr. Rose to drive , " Tom said . " It 's got automatic gears , and the throttle and brake are operated by hand . That 's what he said . " He seemed to be repeating the words parrotfashion , as if he had very little idea of what gears , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THE NEEDLE 43Lucy said , " Is n't that super , David ? " " Top-hole . But where shall I go in it ? " Tom said : " You 're always welcome to visit me and share a pipe and a drop of whisky . I 've been looking forward to having neighbors again . " " " l'hank you , " said Lucy . " This here 's the generator , " Tom said , turning around and pointing . " I 've got one just the same . You put the fuel in here . It delivers alternating current . " " That 's unusual  --  small generators are usually direct cur- rent , " David said . " Aye . I do n't really know the difference , but they tell me this is safer . " " True . A shock from this would throw you across the room , but direct current would kill you . " They went back to the cottage . Tom said , " Well , you 'll want to settle in , and I 've sheep to tend , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ought to tell you  --  in an emergency , I can con- tact the mainland by wireless radio . " David was surprised . " You 've got a radio transmitter ? " " Aye , " Tom said proudly . " I 'm an enemy aircraft spotter in the Royal Observer Corps . " " Ever spotted any ? " David asked . Lucy flashed her disapproval of the sarcasm in David 's voice , but Tom seemed not to notice . " Not yet , " he replied . " Jolly good show . " When Tom had gone Lucy said , " He only wants to do his bit . " " There are lots of us who want to do our bit , " David said . And that , Lucy reflected , was the trouble . She dropped the subject , and wheeled her crippled husband into their new home . When Lucy had been asked to visit the hospital psycholo- gist , she had immediately assumed that David had brain damage . It was not so . " All that 's wrong with his head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the psychologist said . She went on : " However , the loss of both his legs is a trauma , and there 's no telling how it will affect his state of mind . Did he want very much to be a pilot ? " Lucy pondered . " He was afraid , but I think he wanted it very badly , all the same . " " Well , he 'll need all the reassurance and support that you can give him . And patience , too . One thing we can predict is that he will be resentful and ill-tempered for a while . He needs love and rest . " However , during their first few months on the island he seemed to want neither . He did not make love to her , perhaps because he was waiting until his injuries were fully healed . But he did not rest , either . He threw himself into the business of sheep farming , tearing about the island in his jeep with the wheelchair in the back . He built fences along the more treacherous cliffs , shot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when Betsy began to go blind , and burned off the heather ; and in the spring he was out every ' night delivering lambs . One day he felled a great old pine tree near Tom 's cottage , and spent a fortnight stripping it , hewing it into manageable logs and carting them back to the house for firewood . He relished really hard manual labor . He learned to strap himself tightly to the chair to keep his body anchored while he wielded an axe or a mallet . He carved a pair of Indian clubs and exercised with them for hours when Torn could find nothing more for him to do . The muscles of his arms and back became neargrotesque , like those of men who win body-building contests . I Lucy was not unhappy . She had been afraid he might sit by the fire all day and brood over his bad luck . The way he worked was faintly worrying because it was so obsessive , but at least he was not vegetating . She told him about the baby at Christmas . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he gave her a bolt of silk . Tom came over for dinner , and they ate a wild goose he had shot . David drove the shepherdhome after tea , and when he came back Lucy opened a bottle of brandy . Then she said , " I have another present for you , but you ca n't open it until May . " He laughed . " What on earth are you talking about ? How much of that brandy did you drink while I was out ? " " I 'm having a baby . " 46 Ken Follett EYE OF THE NEEDLE 47He stared at her , and all the laughter went out of his face . " Good God , that 's all we bloody well need . " " David ! " " Well , for God 's sake .... When the hell did it happen ? " " That 's not too difficult to figure out , is it ? " she said . " It must have been a week before the wedding . It 's a miracle it survived the crash . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Huh  --  when ? " " So how do you know for sure ? " " Oh , David , do n't be so boring . I know for sure because my periods have stopped and my nipples hurt and I throw up in the mornings and my waist is four inches bigger than it used to be . If you ever looked at me you would know for sure . " " All right . " " What 's the matter with you ? You 're supposed to be thrilled ! " " Oh , sure . Perhaps we 'll have a son , and then I can take him for walks and play football with him , and he 'll grow up wanting to he like his father the war hero , a legless fucking joke ! " " Oh , David , David , " she whispered . She knelt in front of his wheelchair . " David , do n't think like that . He will respect you . He 'll look up to you because you put your life together again , and because you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and because you carried your disability with courage and cheerfulness and  --  " " Do n't be so damned condescending , " he snapped . " You sound like a sanctimonious priest . " She stood up . " Well , do n't act as if it 's my fault . Men can take precautions too , you know . " " Not against invisible trucks in the blackout ! " It was a silly exchange and they both knew it , so Lucy said nothing . The whole idea of Christmas seemed utterly trite now : the bits of colored paper on the walls , and the tree in the corner , and the remains of a goose in the kitchen waiting to be thrown away  --  none of it had anything to do with her life . She began to wonder what she was doing on this bleak island with a man who seemed not to love her , having a baby he did n't want . Why should n't she  --  whynot  --  well , she could .... Then she realized she had nowhereelse to go , nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be other than Mrs. David Rose . Eventually David said , " Well , I 'm going to bed . " He wheeled himself to the hall and dragged himself out of the chair and up the stairs backwards . She heard him scrape across the floor , heard the bed creak as he hauled himself on to it , heard his clothes hit the corner of the room as he undressed , then heard the final groaning of the springs as he lay down and pulled the blankets up over him . And still she would not cry . She looked at the brandy bottle and thought , If I drink all of this now , and have a bath , perhaps I wo n't be pregnantin the morning . She thought about it for a long time , until she came to the conclusion that life without David and the island and the baby would be even worse because it would be empty . So she did not cry , and she did not drink the brandy , and she did not leave the island ; but instead she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her sleeping husband , listening to the wind and trying not to think , until the gulls began to call , and a grey rainy dawn crept over the North Sea and filled the little bedroom with a cold pale light , and at last she went to sleep . A kind of peace settled over her in the spring , as if all threats were postponed until after the baby was born . When the February snow had thawed she planted flowers and vegetables in the patch of ground between the kitchen door and the barn , not really believing they would grow . She cleaned the house thoroughly and told David that if he wanted it done again before August he would have to do it himself . She wrote to her mother and did a lot of knitting and ordered diapers by mail . They suggested she go home to have the baby , but she knew , was afraid , that if she went she would never come back . She went for long walks over the moors , with a bird book under her arm , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very far . She kept the bottle of brandy in a cupboard David never used , and whenever she felt depressed she went to look at it and remind herself of what she had almost lost . Three weeks before the baby was due , she got the boat48 Ken Follettinto Aberdeen . David and Tom waved from the jetty . The sea was so rough that both she and the skipper were terrifiedshe might give birth before they reached the mainland . She went into the hospital in Aberdeen , and four weeks later brought the baby home on the same boat . David knew none of it . He probably thought that women gave birth as easily as ewes , she decided . He was oblivious to the pain of contractions , and that awful , impossible stretching , and the soreness afterward , and the bossy , know-it-all nurses who did n't want you to touch your baby because you were n't brisk and efficient and trained and sterile like they were ; he just saw you go away pregnant and come back with a beautiful , white-wrapped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call him Jonathan . " They added Alfred for David 's father , and Malcolm for Lucy 's , and Thomas for old Tom , but they called the boy Jo , because he was too tiny for Jonathan , let alone JonathanAlfred Malcolm Thomas Rose . David learned to give him his bottle and burp him and change his diaper , and he even dangled him in his lap occasionally , but his interest seemed distant , uninvolved ; he had a problem-solving approach , like the nurses ; it was not for him as it was for Lucy . Tom was closer to the baby than David . Lucy would ! not let him smoke in the room where the baby was , and the old boy would put his great briar pipe with the lid in his pocket for hours and gurgle at little Jo , or watch him kick his feet , or help Lucy bathe him . Lucy suggested mildly that he might be neglecting the sheep . Tom said they did not need him to watch them feed  --  he would rather watch Jo feed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it with small round pebbles , and was overjoyed when Jo grabbed it and shook it , first time , without having to be shown how . David and Lucy still did not make love . First there had been his injuries , and then she had been pregnant , and then she had been recovering from childbirth ; but now the reasons had run out . One night she said , " I 'm back to normal now . " " How do you mean ? " " After the baby . My body is normal . I 've healed . " " Oh , I see . That 's good . " EYE OF THE NEEDLE 49She made sure to go to bed with him so that he could watch her undress , but he always turned his back . As they lay there , dozing off , she would move so that her hand , or her thigh , or her breast , brushed against him , a casual but unmistakable invitation . There was no response . She believed firmly that there was nothing wrong with her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simply want sex , she wanted sex with David . She was sure that , even if there had been another man under seventy on the island , she would not have been tempted . She was n't a sex-starved tart , she was a love-starved wife . The crunch came on one of those nights when they lay on their backs , side by side , both wide awake , listening to the wind outside and the small sounds of Jo from the next room . It seemed to Lucy that it was time he either did it or came right out and said why not ; and that he was going to avoid the issue until she forced it ; and that she might as well force it now . So she brushed her arm across his thighs and opened her mouth to speak  --  and almost cried out with shock to discover that he had an erection . So he could do it ! And he wanted to , or why else  --  and her hand closed triumphantly around the evidence of his desire , and she shifted closer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He said , " Oh , for God 's sake ! " and gripped her wrist and pushed her hand away from him and turned onto his side . But this time she was not going to accept his rebuff in modest silence . " David , why not ? " " Jesus Christ ! " He threw the blankets off , swung himself to the floor , grabbed the eiderdown with one hand , and dragged himself to the door . Lucy sat up in bed and screamed at him , " Why not ? " Jo began to cry . David pulled up the empty legs of his cut-off pajama trousers , pointed to the pursed white skin of his stumps , and said , " That 's why not ! That 's why not ! " He slithered downstairs to sleep on the sofa , and Lucy went into the next bedroom to comfort Jo . It took a long time to lull him back to sleep , probably because she herself was so much in need of comfort . The baby tasted the tears on her cheeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inkling of their meaning  --  would n't tears be one of the first things a baby came to understand ? She could not bring herself to sing to him , or murmur that everything was all right ; so she held him tight and rocked him , and when he had soothed her with his warmth and his clinging , he went to sleep in her arms . She put him back in the cot and stood looking at him for a while . There was no point in going back to bed . She could hear David 's deep-sleep snoring from the living room  --  he had to take powerful pills , otherwise the old pain kept him awake . Lucy needed to get away from him , where she could neither see nor hear him , where he could n't find her for a few hours even if he wanted to . She put on trou- sers and a sweater , a heavy coat and boots , and crept down- stairs and out . There was a swirling mist , damp and bitterly cold , the kind the island @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coat , thought about going back inside for a scarf , and de- cided not to . She squelched along the muddy path , welcom- ing the bite of the fog in her throat , the small discomfort of the weather taking her mind off the larger hurt inside her . She reached the cliff top and walked gingerly down the steep , narrow ramp , placing her feet carefully on the slip- pery boards . At the bottom she jumped off on to the sand and walked to the edge of the sea . The wind and the water were carrying on their perpetual quarrel , the wind swooping down to tease the waves and the sea hissing and spitting as it crashed against the land , the two of them doomed to bicker forever . Lucy walked along the hard sand , letting the noise and the weather fill her head , until the beach ended in a sharp point where the water met the cliff , when she turned and walked back . She paced the shore all night . Toward dawn a thought came to her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As it was , the thought was not much help , holding its meaning in a tightly clenched fist . But she worked on it for a while , and the fist opened to reveal what looked like a small pearl of wisdom nestling in its palm  --  perhaps David 's coldness to her was of one piece with his chopping down trees , and undressing himself , and driving the jeep , andthrowing the Indian clubs , and coming to live on a , cold cruel island in the North Sea .. . What was it he had said ? " ... his father the war hero , a legless joke . . . " He had something to prove , something that would sound trite if it were put into words ; something he could have done as a fighter pilot , but now had to do with trees and fences and Indian clubs and a wheelchair . They would n't let him take the test , and he wanted to be able to say : " I could have passed it anyway , just look how I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had had the courage , and he had suffered the wounds , but he could take no pride in it . If a Messerschmidt had taken his legs the wheelchairwould have been like a medal , a badge of courage . But now , all his life , he would have to say : " It was during the war  --  but no , I never saw any action , this was a car crash . I did my training and I was going to fight , the very next day , I had seen my kite , she was a beauty , and ... " Yes , it was his way of being strong . And perhaps she could be strong , too . She might find ways of patching up the wreck of her life . David had once been good and kind and loving , and she might now learn to wait patiently while he battled to become the complete man he used to be . She could find new hopes , new things to live for . Other women had found the strength to cope with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ camps . She picked up a pebble , drew back her arm , and threw it out to sea with all her might . She did not see or hear it land ; it might have gone on forever , circling the earth like a satellite in a space story . She shouted , " I can be strong , too , damn it . " And then she turned around and started up the ramp to the cottage . It was almost time for Jo 's first feed . EYE OF THE NEEDLE 536It looked like a mansion , and , up to a point , that was what it was  --  a large house , in its own grounds , in the leafy town of Wohldorf just outside North Hamburg . It might have been the home of a mine owner , or a successful importer , or an industrialist . However , it was in fact owned by the Abwehr . It owed its fate to the weather  --  not here , but two hundred miles southeast in Berlin , where atmospheric conditionswere unsuitable for wireless communication with England @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Below that were two huge concrete shelters and several million reichsmarksworth of radio equipment . The electronics system had been put together by a Major Werner Trautmann , and he did a good job . Each hall had twenty neat little soundprooflistening posts , occupied by radio operators who could recognize a spy by the way he tapped out his message , as easily as you can recognize your mother 's handwritingon an envelope . The receiving equipment was built with quality in mind , for the transmitters sending the messages had been designed for compactness rather than power . Most of them were the small suitcase-sets called Klamotten , which had been developed by Telefunken for Admiral Wilhelm Canaris , the head of the Abwehr . On this night the airways were relatively quiet , so everyoneknew when Die Nadel came through . The message was taken by one of the older operators . He tapped out an acknowledgment , transcribed the signal , quickly tore the sheet off his note pad and went to the phone . He read the message over the direct line to Abwehr headquarters atSophien @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a smoke . He offered a cigarette to the youngster in the next booth , and the two of them stood together for a few minutes , leaning against the wall and smoking . The youngster said , " Anything ? " The older man shrugged . " There 's always something when he calls . But not much this time . The Luftwaffe missed St. Paul 's Cathedral again . " " No reply for him ? " " We do n't think he waits for replies . He 's an independentbastard , always was . I trained him in wireless , you know , and once I 'd finished he thought he knew it better than me . " " You 've met Die Nadel ? What 's he like ? " " About as much fun as a dead fish . All the same he 's the best agent we 've got . Some say the best ever . There 's a story that he spent five years working his way up in the NKVD in Russia , and ended up one of Stalin 's most trusted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but it 's the kind of thing he 'd do . A real pro . And the Fuehrer knows it . " " Hitler knows him ? " The older man nodded . " At one time he wanted to see all Die Nadel 's signals . I do n't know if he still does . Not that it would make any difference to Die Nadel . Nothing impresses that man . You know something ? He looks at everybody the same way  --  as if he 's figuring out how he 'll kill you if you make a wrong move . " " I 'm glad I did n't have to train him . " " He learned quickly , I 'll give him that . Worked at it twenty-four hours a day , then when he 'd mastered it , he would n't give me a good-morning . It takes him all his time to remember to salute Canaris . He always signs off ' Regardsto Willi . ' That 's how much he cares about rank . " They finished their cigarettes , dropped them on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man picked up the stubs and pocketed them , because smoking was not really permittedin the dugout . The radios were still quiet . " Yes , he wo n't use his code name , " the older man went on . " Von Braun gave it to him , and he 's never liked it . He 's never liked Von Braun either . Do you remember the54 Ken Folletttime  --  no , it was before you joined us  --  Braun told Nadel to go to the airfield in Farnborough , Kent . The message came back : There is no airfield in Farnborough , Kent . t There is one at Farnborough , Hampshire . Fortunately the Luftwaffe 's geography is better than yours , you cunt . ' Just like that . " " I suppose it 's understandable . When we make mistakes we put their lives on the line . " The older man frowned . He was the one who delivered such judgments , and he did not like his audience to weigh in with opinions of its own . " Perhaps , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his code name ? " " He says it has a meaning , and a code word with a meaningcan give a man away . Von Braun would n't listen . " " A meaning ? The Needle ? What does it mean ? " But at that moment the old-timer 's radio chirped , and he returned quickly to his station , so the explanation never came . PART //07The message annoyed Faber because it forced him to face issues that he had been avoiding . Hamburg had made damn sure the message reached him . He had given his call-sign , and instead of the usual " Acknowledge  --  proceed " they had sent back " Make rendezvousone . " He acknowledged the order , transmitted his report and packed the wireless set back into its suitcase . Then he wheeled his bicycle out of Erith Marshes  --  his cover was a bird-watcher  --  and got on the road to Blackheath . As he cycled back to his cramped two-room flat , he wondered whether to obey the order . He had two reasons for disobedience : one professional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rendezvous one " was an old code , set up by Canaris back in 1937 . It meant he was to go to the doorway of a certain shop between LeicesterSquare and Piccadilly Circus to meet another agent . The agents would recognize each other by the fact that they both carried a Bible . Then there was a patter : " What is today 's chapter ? " " One Kings thirteen . " Then , if they were certain they were not being followed , they would agree that the chapter was " most inspiring . " Otherwise one would say , " I 'm afraid I have n't read it yet . " The shop doorway might not be there any more , but it was not that that troubled Faber . He thought Canaris had probably given the code to most of the bumbling amateurs who had crossed the Channel in 1940 and landed in the arms of MI5 . Faber knew they had been caught because the hangings had been publicized , no doubt to reassure the58 Ken Follett EYE OF THE NEEDLE 59public that something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have given away secrets before they died , so the British now probably knew the old rendezvouscode . If they had picked up the message from Hamburg , that shop doorway must by now be swarming with well-spoken young Englishmen carrying Bibles and practicingsaying " Most inspiring " in a German accent . The Abwehr had thrown professionalism to the wind back in those heady days when the invasion seemed so close . Faber had not trusted Hamburg since . He would not tell them where he lived , he refused to communicate with their other agents in Britain , he varied the frequency he used for transmission without caring whether he stepped all over someone else 's signal . If he had always obeyed his masters , he would not have survived so long . At Woolwich , Faber was joined by a mass of other cyclists , many of them women , as the workers came streaming out of the munitions factory at the end of the day shift . Their cheerful weariness reminded Faber of his personal reason for disobedience : he thought his side was losing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Americans had joined in , Africa was lost , the Italians had collapsed ; the Allies would surely invade France this year , 1944 . Faber did not want to risk his life to no purpose . He arrived home and put his bicycle away . While he was washing his face it dawned on him that , against all logic , he wanted to make the rendezvous . It was a foolish risk , taken in a lost cause , but he was itching to get to it . And the simple reason was that he was unspeakably bored . The routine transmissions , the birdwatching , the bicycle , the boardinghouse teas  --  it was four years since he had experienced anything remotely like action . He seemed to be in no danger whatsoever , and that made him jumpy because he imagined invisible threats . He was happiest when every so often he could identify a threat and take steps to neutralize it . Yes , he would make the rendezvous . But not in the way they expected. * * *There were still crowds in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wondered whether it was the same in Berlin . He bought a Bible at Hatchard 's bookshop in Piccadilly , and stuffed it into his inside coat pocket , out of sight . It was a mild , damp day , with intermittent drizzle , and Faber was carrying an umbrella . This rendezvous was timed for either between nine and ten o'clock in the morning or between five and six in the afternoon , and the arrangement was that one went there every day until the other party turned up . If no contact was made for five successive days one went there on alternate days for two weeks . After that one gave up . Faber got to Leicester Square at ten past nine . The contactwas there , in the tobacconist 's doorway , with a blackboundBible under his arm , pretending to shelter from the rain . Faber spotted him out of the corner of his eye and hurried past , head down . The man was youngish , with a blond moustache and a well-fed look . He wore a black double-breasted raincoat , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not familiar . When Faber walked by the second time on the opposite side of the street , he spotted the tail . A short , stocky man wearing the trenchcoat and trilby hat beloved of English plainclothes policemen was standing just inside the foyer of an office building , looking through the glass doors across the street to the man in the doorway . There were two possibilities . If the agent did not know he had been followed , Faber had only to get him away from the rendezvous and lose the tail . However , the alternativewas that the agent had been captured and the man in the doorway was a substitute , in which case neither he nor the tail must be allowed to see Faber 's face . Faber assumed the worst , then thought of a way to deal with it . There was a telephone booth in the Square . Faber went inside and memorized the number . Then he found I Kings 13 in the Bible , tore out the page , and scribbled in the margin , " Go to the phone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back streets behind the National60 Ken Follett EYE OF THE NEEDLE 61Gallery until he found a small boy , aged about ten or eleven , sitting on a doorstep throwing stones at puddles . Faber said , " Do you know the tobacconist in the Square ? " " Yerst . " " Do you like chewing gum ? " " Yerst . " Faber gave him a page torn from the Bible . " There 's a man in the doorway of the tobacconist 's . If you give him this he 'll give you some gum . " " All right , " the boy said . He stood up . " Is this geezer a Yank ? " " Yerst , " Faber said . The boy ran off . Faber followed him . As the boy approached the agent , Faber ducked into the doorway of the building opposite . The tail was still there , peering through the glass . Faber stood just outside the door , blocking the tail 's view of the scene across the street , and opened his umbrella . He pretended to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something to the boy and walk off . He ended his charade with the umbrella and walked in the direction opposite to the way the agent had gone . He looked back over his shoulder to see the tail run into the street , looking for the vanished agent . Faber stopped at the nearest telephone and dialed the number of the booth in the Square . It took a few minutes to get through . At last a deep voice said , " Hello ? " " What is today 's chapter ? " Faber said . " One Kings thirteen . " " Most inspiring . " " Yes , is n't it . " The fool has no idea of the trouble he 's in , Faber thought . Aloud he said , " Well ? " " I must see you . " " That is impossible . " " But I must ! " There was a note in the voice that Faber thought edged on despair . " The message comes from the very top  --  do you understand ? " Faber pretended to waver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you in one week 's time under the arch at Euston Station at 9 A.M. " " Ca n't you make it sooner ? " Faber hung up and stepped outside . Walking quickly , he rounded two corners and came within sight of the phone booth in the Square . He saw the agent walking in the direction of Piccadilly . There was no sign of the tail . Faber followed the agent . The man went into Piccadilly Circus underground station , and bought a ticket to Stockwell . Faber immediately realizedhe could get there by a more direct route . He came out of the station , walked quickly to Leicester Square and got on a Northern Line train . The agent would have to change trains at Waterloo , whereas Faber 's train was direct ; so Faber would reach Stockwell first , or at the worst they would arrive on the same train . In fact Faber had to wait outside the station at Stockwell for twenty-five minutes before the agent emerged . Faber followed him again . He went into a cafe . There was absolutely nowhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ length of time : no shop windows to gaze into , no benches to sit on or parks to walk around , no bus stops or taxi ranks or public buildings . Faber had to walk up and down the street , always looking as if he were going somewhere , carrying on until he was just out of sight of the cafe then returning on the opposite side , while the agent sat in the warm , steamy cafe drinking tea and eating hot toast . He came out after half an hour . Faber tailed him through a succession of residential streets . The agent knew where he was going , but was in no hurry . He walked like a man who is going home with nothing to do for the rest of the day . He did not look back , and Faber thought , Another amateur . At last he went into a house  --  one of the poor , anonymous , inconspicuous lodging houses used by spies and erranthusbands everywhere . It had a dormer window in the roof ; that would be the agent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Faber walked past , scanning the opposite side of the street . Yes  --  there . A movement behind an upstairs window , a glimpse of a jacket and tie , a watching face withdrawn  --  theopposition was here too . The agent must have62 Ken Follett EYE OF THE NEEDLEgone to the rendezvous yesterday and allowed himself to be followed home by MI5  --  unless , of course , he was MI5 . Faber turned the corner and walked down the next parallelstreet , counting the houses . Almost directly behind the place the agent had entered there was the bomb-damaged shell of what had been a pair of semidetached houses . Good . As he walked back to the station his step was springier , his heart beat a shade faster and he looked around him with bright-eyed interest . It was good . The game was on . He dressed in black that night  --  a woolen hat , a turtlenecksweater under a short leather flying jacket , trousers tucked into socks , rubber-soled shoes  --  all black . He would be almost invisible , for London , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quiet streets with dimmed lights , keeping off main roads . It was after midnight , and he saw no one . He left the bike a quarter of a mile away from his destination , padlocking it to the fence in a pub yard . He went , not to the agent 's house , but to the bombedoutshell in the next street . He picked his way carefully across the rubble in the front garden , entered the gaping doorway , and went through the house to the back . It was very dark . A thick screen of low cloud hid the moon and stars . Faber had to walk slowly with his hands in front of him . He reached the end of the garden , jumped over the fence , and crossed the next two gardens . In one of the houses a dog barked for a moment . The garden of the lodging house was unkempt . Faber walked into a blackberry bush and stumbled . The thorns scratched his face . He ducked under a line of washing  --  there was enough light for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and took from his pocket a small tool with a scoop-shaped blade . The putty around the glass was old and brittle , and already flaking away in places . After twenty minutes ' silent work he took the pane out of the frame and laid it gently on the grass . He shone a flashlight through the empty hole to make sure there were no noisy obstacles in his way , opened the catch , raised the window and then climbed in . The darkened house smelled of boiled fish and disinfectant . Faber unlocked the back door  --  a precaution for fast exit  --  before entering the hall . He flashed his pencil light on and off quickly , once . In that instant of light he took in a tiled hallway , a kidney table he must circumvent , a row of coats on hooks and a staircase , to the right , carpeted . He climbed the stairs silently . He was halfway across the landing to the second flight when he saw the light under the door . A split-second later there was an asthmatic cough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door in two strides and froze against the wall . Light flooded the landing as the door opened . Faber slipped his stiletto out of his sleeve . The old man came out of the toilet and crossed the landing , leaving the light on . At his bedroom door he grunted , turned and came back . He must see me , Faber thought . He tightened his grip on the handle of his knife . The old man 's half-open eyes were directed on the floor . He looked up as he reached for the light cord , and Faber almost killed him then  --  but the man fumbled for the switch and Faber realized he was so sleepy he was practically somnambulating . The light died , the old man shuffled back to bed , and Faber breathed again . There was only one door at the top of the second flight of stairs . Faber tried it gently . It was locked . He took another tool from the pocket of his jacket . The noise of the toilet tank filling covered the sound of Faber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He could hear deep regular breathing . He stepped inside . The sound came from the opposite corner of the room . He could see nothing . He crossed the pitch-dark room very slowly , feeling the air in front of him at each step , until he was beside the bed . He had the flashlight in his left hand , the stiletto loose in his sleeve and his right hand free . He switched on the flashlight and grabbed the sleeping man 's throat in a stranglinggrip . The agent 's eyes snapped open , but he could make no sound . Faber straddled the bed and sat on him . Then he whispered , " One Kings thirteen , " and relaxed his grip. 64 Ken Follett EYE OF THE NEEDLE 65The agent peered into the flashlight , trying to see Faber'sface . He rubbed his neck where Faber 's hand had squeezed . " Be still ! " Faber shone the light into the agent 's eyes , and with his right hand drew the stiletto . " Are n't you going to let me get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can do no more damage . " " Damage ? More damage ? " " You were watched in Leicester Square , and you let me follow you here , and they are observing this house . Should I trust you to do anything ? " " My God , I 'm sorry . " " Why did they send you ? " " The message had to be delivered personally . The orders come from the top . The very top  --  " The agent stopped . " Well ? What orders ? " " I ... have to be sure it 's you . " " How can you be sure ? " " I must see your face . " Faber hesitated , then shone the flashlight at himself briefly . " Satisfied ? " " Die Nadel . " " And who are you ? " " Major Friedrich Kaldor , sir . " " I should call you Sir . " " Oh , no , sir . You 've been promoted twice in your absence . You are now a lieutenant-colonel . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Are n't you pleased ? " " I should be pleased to go back and put Major von Braun on latrine duty . " " May I get up , sir ? " " Certainly not . What if Major Kaldor is held in WandsworthJail and you are a substitute , waiting to give a signal to your watching friends in the house opposite ? ... Now , what are these orders from the very top ? " " Well , sir , we believe there will be an invasion of France this year . " " Brilliant , brilliant . Go on . " " They believe that General Patton is massing the First United States Army Group in the part of England knownas East Anglia . If that army is the invasion force , then it follows that they will attack via the Pas de Calais . " " That makes sense . But I have seen no sign of this army of Patton 's . " " There is some doubt in the highest circles in Berlin . The Fuehrer 's astrologer  --  " " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ astrologer , who tells him to defend Normandy . " " My God . Are things that bad there ? " " He gets plenty of earthbound advice , too . I personally believe he uses the astrologer as an excuse when he thinks the generals are wrong but he ca n't fault their arguments . " Faber sighed . He had been afraid of news like this . " Go on . " " Your assignment is to assess the strength of FUSAG : numbers of troops , artillery , air support  --  " " I know how to measure armies . " " Of course . " He paused . " I am instructed to emphasize the importance of the mission , sir . " " And you have done so . Tell me , are things that bad in Berlin ? " The agent hesitated . " No , sir . Morale is high , output of munitions increases every month , the people spit at the RAF bombers  --  " " Never mind , I can get the propaganda from my radio . " The younger man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything else to tell me ? Officially , I mean . " " Yes . For the duration of the assignment you have a special bolt-hole . " " They do think it 's important , " Faber said . " You rendezvous with a U-boat in the North Sea , ten miles due east of a town called Aberdeen . Just call them in on your normal radio frequency and they will surface . As soon as you or I have told Hamburg that the orders have been passed from me to you , the route will be open . The boat will be there every Friday and Monday at 6 P.M. and will wait until 6 A.M. " " Aberdeen is a big town . Do you have an exact map reference ? " 66 Ken Follett " Yes . " The agent recited the numbers , and Faber memorizedthem . " Is that everything , Major ? " " Yes , sir . " " What do you plan to do about the gentlemen from MI5 in the house across the road ? " The agent shrugged . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Faber thought , It 's no good . " What are your orders after you have seen me ? Do you have a bolt-hole ? " " No . I am to go to a town called Weymouth and steal a boat to return to France . " That was no plan at all . So , Faber thought , Canaris knew how it would be . Very well . " And if you are caught by the British and tortured ? " he said . " I have a suicide pill . " " And you will use it ? " " Most certainly . " Faber looked at him . " I think you might , " he said . He placed his left hand on the agent 's chest and put his weight on it , as if he were about to get off the bed . That way he was able to feel exactly where the rib cage ended and the soft belly began . He thrust the point of the stiletto in just under the ribs and stabbed upward to the heart . The agent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his throat but did not get out . His body convulsed . Faber pushed the stiletto an inch farther in . The eyes closed and the body went limp . " You saw my face , " Faber said. 8 " I think we 've lost control of it , " said Percival Godliman . Frederick Bloggs nodded agreement , and added , " It 's my fault . " The man looked weary , Godliman thought . He had had that look for almost a year , ever since the night they had dragged the crushed remains of his wife from underneath the rubble of a bombed house in Hoxton . " I 'm not interested in apportioning blame , " Godliman said . " The fact is that something happened in Leicester Square during the few seconds you lost sight of Blondie . " " Do you think the contact was made ? " " Possibly . " " When we picked him up again in Stockwell , I thought he had simply given up for the day . " " If that were the case he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was making patterns with matchsticks on his desk , a thinking habit he had developed . " Still no movement at the house ? " " Nothing . He 's been in there for forty-eight hours . " Bloggs repeated , " It 's my fault . " " Do n't be a bore , old chap , " Godliman said . " It was my decision to let him run so that he would lead us to someone else , and I still think it was the right move . " Bloggs sat motionless , his expression blank , his hands in the pockets of his raincoat . " If the contact has been made , we should n't delay picking Blondie up and finding out what his mission was . " " That way we lose whatever chance we have of following Blondie to somebody more important . " " Your decision . " Godliman had made a church with his matches . He68 Ken Follett stared at it for a moment , then took a halfpenny from his pocket and tossed it . " Tails , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The landlord was a middle-aged Irish Republican from Lisdoonvarna , County Clare , who harbored a secret hope that the Germans would win the war and thus free the Emerald Isle from English oppression forever . He limped arthritically around the old house , collecting his weekly rents , thinking how much he would be worth if those rents were allowed to rise to their true market value . He was not a rich man  --  he owned only two houses , this and the smaller one in which he lived . He was permanently bad-tempered . On the first floor he tapped on the door of the old man . This tenant was always pleased to see him . He was proba- bly pleased to see anybody . He said , " Hello , Mr. Riley , would you like a cup of tea ? " " No time today . " " Oh , well . " The old man handed over the money . " I expect you 've seen the kitchen window . " " No , I did n't go in there . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out . I patched it over with blackout curtain , but of course there is a draft . " " Who smashed it ? " the landlord asked . " Funny thing , it ai n't broke . Just lying there on the grass .

Aloud he said , " I do n't suppose it occurred to you that you might have been burgled ? " The old man looked astonished . " I never thought of that . " " Nobody 's missing any valuables ? " " Nobody 's said so to me . " The landlord went to the door . " All right , I 'll have a look when I go down . " The old man followed him out .

" The landlord knocked on the door . There was no answer . He opened it and went in , and the old man followed him . " Well , well , well , " the old sergeant said heartily . " I think you 've got a dead one . " He stood in the doorway , surveying the room . " You touched anything , Paddy ? " " No , " the landlord replied . " And the name 's Mr. Riley .

He went over to the bed . The young man 's face was peaceful , his hands clasped over his chest . " I 'd say heart attack , if he was n't so young .

There was an identity card and a ration book , and a fairly thick wad of notes . " Papers in order and he ai n't been robbed . " " He 's only been here a week or so , " the landlord said . " I do n't know much about him at all . He came from North Wales to work in a factory . " " Well , " the sergeant observed , " if he was as healthy as he looked he 'd be in the Army . " He opened the suitcase on the table . " Bloody hell , what 's this lot ? " The landlord and the old man had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " It 's a radio " at the same time as the old man said , " He 's bleeding . " " Do n't touch that body ! " the sergeant said . " He 's had a knife in the guts , " the old man persisted . The sergeant gingerly lifted one of the dead hands from the chest to reveal a small trickle of dried blood . " He was bleeding , " he said . " Where 's the nearest phone ? " " Five doors down , " the landlord told him . " Lock this room and stav out until I get back . " 70 Ken Follett The sergeant left the house and knocked at the door of the neighbor with the phone . A woman opened it . " Good morning , madam . May I use your telephone ? " " Come in . " She showed him the phone , on a stand in the hall . " What 's happened  --  anything exciting ? " " A tenant died in a lodging house just up the road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Murdered ? " she asked , wide-eyed . " I leave that to the experts . Hello ? Superintendent Jones , please . This is Canter . " He looked at the woman . " Might I ask you just to pop in the kitchen while I talk to my governor ? " She went , disappointed . " Hello , Super . This body 's got a knife wound and a suit- case radio . " " What 's the address again , Sarge ? " Sergeant Canter told him . " Yes , that 's the one they 've been watching . This is an MI5 job , Sarge . Go to number 42 and tell the surveillance team there what you 've found . I 'll get on to their chief . Off you go . " Canter thanked the woman and crossed the road . He was quite thrilled ; this was only his second murder in thirty-one years as a Metropolitan Policeman , and it turned out to involve espionage ! He might make Inspector yet . He knocked on the door of number 42 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said : " Are you the secret agents from MI5 ? " Bloggs arrived at the same time as a Special Branch man , Detective-Inspector Harris , whom he had known in his Scotland Yard days . Canter showed them the body . They stood still for a moment , looking at the peaceful young face with its blond moustache . Harris said , " Who is he ? " " Codename Blondie , " Bloggs told him . " We think he came in by parachute a couple of weeks ago . We picked up a radio message to another agent arranging a rendez- vous . We knew the code , so we were able to watch the rendezvous . We hoped Blondie would lead us to the resi- dent agent , who would be a much more dangerous specimen . " " So what happened here ? " " Damned if I know . " Harris looked at the wound in the agent 's chest . " Stiletto ? " " Something like that . A very neat job . Under the ribs and straight up into the heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of entry ? " He led them downstairs to the kitchen . They looked at the windowframe and the unbroken pane of glass lying on the lawn . Canter said , " Also , the lock on the bedroom door had been picked . " They sat down at the kitchen table , and Canter made tea . Bloggs said , " It happened the night after I lost him in Leicester Square . I , fouled it all up . " Harris said , " Do n't be so hard on yourself . " They drank their tea in silence for a while . Harris said , " How are things with you , anyway ? You do n't drop in at the Yard . " " Busy. , , " How 's Christine ? " " Killed in the bombing . " Harris 's eyes widened . " You poor bastard . " " You all right ? " " Lost my brother in North Africa . Did you ever meet Johnny ? " " No . " " He was a lad . Drink ? You 've never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he could never afford to get married  --  which is just as well , the way things turned out . " " Most have lost somebody , I guess . " " If you 're on your own , come round our place for dinner on Sunday . " " Thanks , I work Sundays now . " Harris nodded . " Well , whenever you feel like it . " A detective-constable poked his head around the door and addressed Harris . " Can we start bagging-up the evidence , guv ? " Harris looked at Bloggs. 72 Ken Follett " I 've finished , " Bloggs said . " All right , son , carry on , " Harris told him . Bloggs said , " Suppose he made contact after I lost him , and arranged for the resident agent to come here . The resi- dent may have suspected a trap  --  that would explain why he came in through the window and picked the lock . " " It makes him a devilish suspicious bastard , " Harris observed . " That might be why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into Blondie 's room and wakes him up . Now he knows it is n't a trap , right ? " " Right . " " So why does he kill Blondie ? " " Maybe they quarreled . " " There were no signs of a struggle . " Harris frowned into his empty cup . " Perhaps he realized that Blondie was being watched and he was afraid we 'd pick the boy up and make him spill the beans . " Bloggs said , " That makes him a ruthless bastard . " " That , too , might be why we 've never caught him . " " Come in . Sit down . I 've just had a call from MI6 . Ca- naris has been fired . " Bloggs went in , sat down , and said , " Is that good news or bad ? " " Very bad , " said Godliman . " It 's happened at the worst possible moment . " " Do I get told why ? " Godliman looked at him intently , then said , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have forty double agents broadcasting to Hamburg false information about Allied plans for the invasion of France . " Bloggs whistled . " I did n't know it was quite that big . I suppose the doubles say we 're going in at Cherbourg , but really it will be Calais , or vice versa . " " Something like that . Apparently I do n't need to know the details . Anyway they have n't told me . However , the whole thing is in danger . We knew Canaris ; we knew we had him fooled ; we felt we could have gone on fooling him . A new broom may mistrust his predecessor 's agents . There 's more  --  we 've had some defections from the other side , people who could have betrayed the Abwehr 's people over here if they had n't been betrayed already . It 's another reason for the Germans to begin to suspect our doubles . " Then there 's the possibility of a leak . Literally thousandsof people now know about the double-cross system . There are doubles in Iceland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Middle East . " And we made a bad mistake last year by repatriating a German called Erich Carl . We later learned he was an Abwehragent  --  a real one  --  and that while he was in internmenton the Isle of Man he may have learned about two doubles , Mutt and Jeff , and possibly a third called Tate . " So we 're on thin ice . If one decent Abwehr agent in Britain gets to know about Fortitude  --  that 's the code name for the deception plan  --  the whole strategy will be endangered . Not to mince words , we could lose the fucking war . " Bloggs suppressed a smile  --  he could remember a time when Professor Godliman did not know the meaning of such words . The professor went on , " The Twenty Committee has made it quite clear that they expect me to make sure there are n't any decent Abwehr agents in Britain . " " Last week we would have been quite confident that there were n't , " Bloggs said . " Now we know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let him slip through our fingers . " " So now we have to find him again . " " I do n't know , " Bloggs said gloomily . " We do n't know what part of the country he 's operating from , we have n't the faintest idea what he looks like . He 's too crafty to be pinpointed by triangulation while he 's transmitting  --  otherwisewe would have nabbed him long ago . We do n't even know his code name . So where do we start ? " " Unsolved crimes , " said Godliman . " Look  --  a spy is bound to break the law . He forges papers , he steals petrol and ammunition , he evades checkpoints , he enters restrictedareas , he takes photographs , and when people rumblehim he kills them . The police are bound to get to know of some of these crimes if the spy has been operating for any length of time . If we go through the unsolved crimes files since the war , we 'll find traces . " 74 Ken Follett " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Bloggs said incredulously . " The files would fill the Albert Hall ! " Godliman shrugged . " So , we narrow it down to London , and we start with murders . " They found what they were looking for on the very first day of their search . It happened to be Godliman who came across it , and at first he did not realize its significance . It was the file on the murder of a Mrs. Una Garden in Highgate in 1940 . Her throat had been cut and she had been sexually molested , although not raped . She had been found in the bedroom of her lodger , with considerable alcoholin her bloodstream . The picture was fairly clear : she had had a tryst with the lodger , he had wanted to go farther than she was prepared to let him , they had quarreled , he had killed her , and the murder had neutralized his libido . But the police had never found the lodger . Godliman had been about to pass over the file  --  spies did not get involved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with records , so he read every word , and consequently discovered that the unfortunate Mrs. Garden had received stiletto wounds in her back as well as the fatal wound to her throat . Godliman and Bloggs were on opposite sides of awoodentable in the records room at Old Scotland Yard . Godliman tossed the file across the table and said , " I think this is it . " Bloggs glanced through it and said , " The stiletto . " They signed for the file and walked the short distance to the War Office . When they returned to Godliman 's room , there was a decoded signal on his desk . He read it casually , then thumped the table in excitement . " It 's him ! " Bloggs read : " Orders received . Regards to Willi . " " Remember him ? " Godliman said . " Die Nadel ? " " Yes , " Bloggs said hesitantly . " The Needle . But there'snot much information here . " " Think , think ! A stiletto is like a needle . It 's the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those signals in 1940 that we could n't trace , the rendezvous with Blondie ... " " Possibly . " Bloggs looked thoughtful . EYE OF THE NEEDLE 75 " I can prove it , " Godliman said . " Remember the transmissionabout Finland that you showed me the first day I came here ? The one that was interrupted ? " " Yes . " Bloggs went to the file to find it . " If my memory serves me well , the date of that transmissionis the same as the date of this murder ... and I 'll bet the time of death coincides with the interruption . " Bloggs looked at the signal in the file . " Right both times . " " There ! " " He 's been operating in London for at least five years , and it 's taken us until now to get on to him , " Bloggs reflected . " He wo n't be easy to catch . " Godliman suddenly looked wolfish . " He may be clever , but he 's not as clever as me , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to the fucking wall . " Bloggs laughed out loud . " My God , you 've changed , Professor .

" It 's the fashion , dear . It saves on material . But it is n't as cold as this on the mainland . Such a wind ! I suppose it 's all right to leave my case on the jetty  --  nobody to steal it ! Jane is engaged to an American soldier  --  a white one , thank God . He comes from a place called Milwaukee , and he does n't chew gum . Is n't that nice ?

They reached the cottage . Mother said , " Is n't this lovely ? " They went in . " I think this is just lovely . " Lucy parked Mother at the kitchen table and made tea . " Tom will get your case up . He 'll be here for his lunch shortly . " " The shepherd ? " " Yes . " " Does he find things for David to do , then ? " Lucy laughed . " It 's the other way around . I 'm sure he 'll tell you all about it himself . You have n't told me why you 're here . " " My dear , it 's about time I saw you . I know you 're not supposed to make unnecessary journeys , but once in four years is n't extravagant , is it ? " They heard the jeep outside , and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother-in-law and introducedTom . Lucy said , " Tom , you can earn your lunch today by bringing Mother 's case up , as she carried your groceries . " David was warming his hands at the stove . " It 's raw today . " " You 're really taking sheep-farming seriously , then ? " Mother said . " The flock is double what it was three years ago , " David told her . " My father never farmed this island seriously . I 've fenced six miles of the cliff top , improved the grazing , and introduced modern breeding methods . Not only do we have more sheep , but each animal gives us more meat and wool . " Mother said tentatively , " I suppose Tom does the physi-calwork and you give the orders . " David laughed . " Equal partners , Mother . " They had hearts for lunch , and both men ate mountains of potatoes . Mother commented favorably on Jo 's table manners . Afterwards David lit a cigarette and Tom stuffed his pipe. 78 Ken FollettMother said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're going to give us more grandchildren . " She smiled brightly . There was a long silence . " Well , I think it 's wonderful , the way David copes , " said Mother . Lucy said , " Yes . " They were walking along the cliff top . The wind had dropped on the third day of Mother 's visit and it was mild enough to go out . They took Jo , dressed in a fisherman 's sweater and a fur coat . They had stopped at the top of a rise to watch David , Tom and the dog herding sheep . Lucy could see in Mother 's face an internal struggle between concern and discretion . She decided to save her mother the effort of asking . " He does n't love me , " she said . Mother looked quickly to make sure Jo was out of earshot . " I 'm sure it 's not that bad , dear . Different men show their love in diff  --  " " Mother , we have n't been man and wife  --  properlysincewe were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jo with a nod . " That was a week before the wedding . " " Oh ! Oh , dear . Is it , you know , the accident ? " " Yes , but not in the way you mean . It 's nothing physical . He just ... wo n't . " Lucy was crying quietly , the tears tricklingdown her wind-browned cheeks . " Have you talked about it ? " " I 've tried . " " Perhaps with time  --  " " It 's been almost four years ! " There was a pause . They began to walk on across the heather , into the weak afternoon sun . Jo chased gulls . Mother said , " 1 almost left your father , once . " It was Lucy 's turn to be shocked . " When ? " " It was soon after Jane was born . We were n't so welloffin those days , you know  --  Father was still working for his father , and there was a slump . I was expecting for the third time in three years , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making ends meet stretched out in front of me with nothing to relieve the monotony . Then I discoveredhe was seeing an old flame of his  --  Brenda Simmonds , you never knew her , she went to Basingstoke . Suddenly I asked myself what I was doing it for , and I could n't think of a sensible answer . " Lucy had dim , patchy memories of those days : her grandfatherwith a white moustache ; her father in a more slender edition ; extended family meals in the great farmhouse kitchen ; a lot of laughter and sunshine and animals . Even then her parents ' marriage had seemed to represent solid contentment , happy permanence . She said , " Why did n't you ? Leave , I mean . " " Oh , people just did n't , in those days . There was n't all this divorce , and a woman could n't get a job . " " Women work at all sorts of things now . " " They did in the last war , but everything changed afterwardwith a bit of unemployment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Men get their way , you know , generally speaking . " " And you 're glad you stayed . " It was not a question . " People my age should n't make pronouncements about life . But my life has been a matter of making-do , and the same goes for most of the women I know . Steadfastness always looks like a sacrifice , but usually it is n't . Anyway , I 'm not going to give you advice . You would n't take it , and if you did you 'd blame your problems on me , I expect . " " Oh , Mother . " Lucy smiled . Mother said , " Shall we turn around ? I think we 've gone far enough for one day . " In the kitchen one evening Lucy said to David , " I 'd like Mother to stay another two weeks , if she will . " Mother was upstairs putting Jo to bed , telling him a story . " Is n't a fortnight long enough for you to dissect my personality ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He wheeled himself over to her chair . " Are you telling me you do n't talk about me ? " " Of course we talk about you  --  you 're my husband . " " What do you say to her ? " " Why are you so worried ? " Lucy said , not without malice . " What are you so ashamed of ? " " Damn you , I 've nothing to be ashamed of . No one80 Ken Follett wants his personal life talked about by a pair of gossiping women  --  " " We do n't gossip about you . " " What do you say ? " " Are n't you touchy ! " " Answer my question . " " I say I want to leave you , and she tries to talk me out of it . " He spun around and wheeled away . " Tell her not to bother for my sake . " She called , " Do you mean that ? " He stopped . " I do n't need anybody , do you understand ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me ? " she said quietly . " Perhaps I need somebody . " " What for ? " " To love me . " Mother came in , and sensed the atmosphere . " He 's fast asleep , " she said . " Dropped off before Cinderella got to the ball . I think I 'll pack a few things , not to leave it all until tomorrow . " She went out again . " Do you think it will ever change , David ? " Lucy asked . " I do n't know what you mean . " " Will we ever be ... the way we were , before the wedding ? " " My legs wo n't grow back , if that 's what you mean . " " Oh , God , do n't you know that does n't bother me ? I just want to be loved . " David shrugged . " That 's your problem . " He went out before she started to cry . Mother did not stay the second fortnight . Lucy walked with her down to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they both wore mackintoshes . They stood in silence waiting for the boat , watching the rain pit the sea with tiny craters . Mother held Jo in her arms . " Things will change , in time , you know , " she said . " Four years is nothing in a marriage . " Lucy said , " I do n't know , but there 's not much I can do . There 's Jo , and the war , and David 's condition  --  how can I leave ? " The boat arrived , and Lucy exchanged her mother for three boxes of groceries and five letters . The water was choppy . Mother sat in the boat 's tiny cabin . They waved her around the headland . Lucy felt very lonely . Jo began to cry . " I do n't want Gran to go away ! " " Nor do I , " said Lucy. 10 Godlirnan and Bloggs walked side by side along the pave- ment of a bomb-damaged London shopping street . They were a mismatched pair : the stooped , birdlike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking where he was going , taking short , scurrying steps ; and the flat- footed youngster , blond and purposeful , in his detective 's raincoat and melodramatic hat ; a cartoon looking for a caption . Godliman was saying , " I think Die Nadel is well- connected . " " Why ? " " The only way he could be so insubordinate with impu- nitYIt 's this Regards to Willi ' line . It must refer to Canaris . " " You think he was pals with Canaris . " " He 's pals with somebody  --  perhaps someone more pow- erful than Canaris was . " " I have the feeling this is leading somewhere . " " People who are well-connected generally make those connections at school , or university or staff college . Look at that . " They were outside a shop that had a huge empty space where once there had been a plate-glass window . A rough sign , hand-painted and nailed to the window-frame , said , " Even more open than usual . " Bloggs laughed , " I saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we are still open . ' " " It 's become a minor art form . " They walked on . Bloggs said , " So , what if Die Nadel did go to school with someone high in the Wehrmacht ? " " People always have their pictures taken at school . Mid- dleton down in the basement at Kensington  --  that house where MI6 used to be before the war  --  he 's got a collection of thousands of photdgraphs of German officers : school photos , binges in the Mess , passing-out parades , shaking hands with Adolf , newspaper pictures  --  everything . " " I see , " Bloggs said . " So if you 're right , and Die Nadel has been through Germany 's equivalent of Eton and Sandhurst , we 've probably got a picture of him . " " Almost certainly . Spies are notoriously camera-shy , but they do n't become spies in school . It will be a youthful Die Nadel that we find in Middleton 's files . " They skirted a huge crater outside a barber 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pole lay in shards on the pavement . The sign in the window said , " We 've had a close shave  --  come and get one yourself . " " How will we recognize him ? No one has ever seen him , " Bloggs said . " Yes , they have . At Mrs. Garden 's boarding house in Highgate they know him quite well . " The Victorian house stood on a hill overlooking London . It was built of red brick , and Bloggs thought it looked angry at the damage Hitler was doing to its city . It was high up , a good place from which to broadcast . Die Nadel would have lived on the top floor . Bloggs wondered what secrets he had transmitted to Hamburg from this place in the dark days of 1940 : map references for aircraft factories and steelworks , details of coastal defenses , political gossip , gas masks and Anderson shelters and sandbags , British morale , bomb damage reports , " Well done , boys , you got Christine Bloggs at last  --  " Shut up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a black jacket and striped trousers . " Good morning . I 'm Inspector Bloggs , from Scotland Yard . I 'd like a word with the householder , please . " Bloggs saw fear come to the man 's eyes , then a young woman appeared in the doorway behind him and said , " Come in , please . " The tiled hall smelled of wax polish . Bloggs hung his hat and coat on a stand . The old man disappeared into the depths of the house , and the woman led Bloggs into a84 Ken Follettlounge . It was expensively furnished in a rich , old-fashioned way . There were bottles of whisky , gin and sherry on a trolley ; all the bottles were unopened . The woman sat on a floral arm-chair and crossed her legs . " Why is the old man frightened of the police ? " Bloggs said . " My father-in-law is a German Jew . He came here in 1935 to escape Hitler , and in 1940 you put him in a concentration camp . His wife killed herself at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Man . He had a letter from the King , apologizing for the inconvenience to which he had been put . " Bloggs said , " We do n't have concentration camps . " " We invented them . In South Africa . Did n't you know ? We go on about our history , but we forget bits . We 're so good at blinding ourselves to unpleasant facts . " " Perhaps it 's just as well . " " What ? " " In 1939 we blinded ourselves to the unpleasant fact that we alone could n't win a war with Germany  --  and look what happened . " " That 's what my father-in-law says . He 's not as cynical as I. What can we do to assist Scotland Yard ? " Bloggs had been enjoying the debate , and now it was with reluctance that he turned his attention to work . " It 's about a murder that took place here four years ago . " " So long ! " " Some new evidence may have come to light . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ owner was killed by a tenant . My husband bought the house from her executor  --  she had no heirs . " " I want to trace the other people who were tenants at that time . " " Yes . " The woman 's hostility had gone now , and her intelligent face showed the effort of recollection . " When we arrived there were three who had been here before the murder : a retired naval officer , a salesman and a young boy from Yorkshire . The boy joined the Army  --  he still writes to us . The salesman was called up and he died at sea . I know because two of his five wives got in touch with us ! And the Commander is still here . " EYE OF THE NEEDLE 85 " Still here ! " That was a piece of luck . " I 'd like to see him , please . " " Surely . " She stood up . " He 's aged a lot . I 'll take you to his room . " They went up the carpeted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ While you 're talking to him , I 'll look up the last letter from the boy in the Army . " She knocked on the door . It was more than Blogg 's landlady would have done , he thought wryly . A voice called , " It 's open , " and Bloggs went in . The Commander sat in a chair by the window with a blanket over his knees . He wore a blazer , a collar and a tie , and spectacles . His hair was thin , his moustache grey , his skin loose and wrinkled over a face that might once have been strong . The room was the home of a man living on memories  --  there were paintings of sailing ships , a sextantand a telescope , and a photograph of himself as a boy aboard HMS Winchester . " Look at this , " he said without turning around . " Tell me why that chap is n't in the Navy . " Bloggs crossed to the window . A horse-drawn baker 's van was at the curb outside the house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deliveries were made . That " chap " was a woman with short blonde hair , in trousers . She had a magnificent bust . Bloggs laughed . " It 's a woman in trousers , " he said . " Bless my soul , so it is ! " The Commander turned around . " Ca n't tell these days , you know . Women in trousers ! " Bloggs introduced himself . " We 've reopened the case of a murder committed here in 1940 . I believe you lived here at the same time as the main suspect , one Henry Faber . " " Indeed ! What can I do to help ? " " How well do you remember Faber ? " " Perfectly . Tall chap , dark hair , well-spoken , quiet . Rather shabby clothes  --  if you were the kind who judges by appearances , you might well mistake him . I did n't dislike him  --  would n't have minded getting to know him better , but he did n't want that . I suppose he was about your age . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people assuminghe must be older simply because he was a detective. 86 Ken Follett EYE OF THE NEEDLE 87The Commander added , " I 'm sure he did n't do it , you know . I know a bit about character  --  you ca n't command a ship without learning  --  and if that man was a sex maniac , I 'm Hermann Goering . " Bloggs suddenly connected the blonde in trousers with the mistake about his age , and the conclusion depressed him . He said , " You know , you should always ask to see a policeman 's warrant card . " The Commander was slightly taken aback . " All right , then , let 's have it . " Bloggs opened his wallet and folded it to display the picture of Christine . " Here . " The Commander studied it for a moment , then said , " A very good likeness . " Bloggs sighed . The old man was very nearly blind . He stood up . " That 's all , for now , " he said . " Thank you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to help . I 'm not much value to England these days  --  you 've got to be pretty uselessto get invalided out of the Home Guard , you know . " " Good-bye . " Bloggs went out . The woman was in the hall downstairs . She handed Bloggs a letter . " The boy 's address is a Forces box number , " she said . " Parkin 's his name ... no doubt you 'll be able to find out where he is . " " You knew the Commander would be no use , " Bloggs said . " I guess not . But a visitor makes his day . " She opened the door . On impulse , Bloggs said , " Will you have dinner with me ? " A shadow crossed her face . " My husband is still on the Isle of Man . " " I 'm sorry  --  I thought  --  " " It 's all right . I 'm flattered . " " I wanted to convince you we 're not the Gestapo . " " I know you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Bloggs said , " I lost my wife in the bombing . " " Then you know how it makes you hate . " " Yes , " said Bloggs . " It makes you hate . " He went down the steps . The door closed behind him . It had started to rain ... . * * *It had been raining then too . Bloggs was late home . He had been going over some new material with Godliman . Now he was hurrying , so that he would have half an hour with Christine before she went out to drive her ambulance . It was dark , aitd the raid had already started . The things Christine saw at night were so awful she had stopped talking about them . Bloggs was proud of her , proud . The people she worked with said she was better than two men  --  she hurtled through blacked-out London , driving like a veteran , taking corners on two wheels , whistling and cracking jokes as the city turned to flame around her . Fearless , they called her . Bloggs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not let it show . He knew because he saw her eyes in the morning when he got up and she went to bed ; when her guard was down and it was over for a few hours ; he knew it was not fearlessness but courage , and he was proud . It was raining harder when he got off the bus . He pulled down his hat and put up his collar . At a tobacconist 's he bought cigarettes for Christine  --  she had started smoking recently like a lot of women . The shopkeeper would let him have only five , because of the shortage . He put them in a Woolworth 's bakelite cigarette case . A policeman stopped him and asked for his identity card ; another two minutes wasted . An ambulance passed him , similar to the one Christine drove ; a requisitioned fruit truck , painted grey . He began to get nervous as he approached home . The explosions were sounding closer , and he could hear the aircraftclearly . The East End was in for another bruising tonight ; he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one , terribly close , and he quickened his step . He would eat his supper in the shelter , too . He turned into his own street , saw the ambulances and the fire engines , and broke into a run . The bomb had landed on his side of the street , around the middle . It must be close to his own home . Jesus in heaven , not us , noThere had been a direct hit on the roof , and the house was literally flattened . He raced up to the crowd of people , 88 Ken Follettneighbors and firemen and volunteers . " Is my wife all right ? Is she out ? Is she in there ? " A fireman looked at him . " Nobody 's come out of there , mate . " Rescuers were picking over the rubble . Suddenly one of them shouted , " Over here ! " Then he said , " Jesus , it 's FearlessBloggs ! " Frederick dashed to where the man stood . Christine was underneath a huge chunk of brickwork . Her face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called , " Lifting gear , boys , sharp 's the word . " Christine moaned and stirred . " She 's alive ! " Bloggs said . He knelt down beside her and got his hand under the edge of the lump of rubble . The rescuer said , " You wo n't shift that , son . " The brickwork lifted . " God , you 'll kill yourself , " the rescuer said , and bent down to help . When it was two feet off the ground they got their shouldersunder it . The weight was off Christine now . A third man joined in , and a fourth . They all straightened up together . Bloggs said , " I 'll lift her out . " He crawled under the sloping roof of brick and cradled his wife in his arms . " Fuck me it 's slipping ! " someone shouted . Bloggs scurried out from under with Christine held tightly to his chest . As soon as he was clear the rescuers let go of the rubble and jumped away . It fell back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realized that that had landed on Christine , he knew she was going to die . He carried her to the ambulance , and it took off immediately . She opened her eyes again once , before she died , and said , " You 'll have to win the war without me , kiddo . " More than a year later , as he walked downhill from Highgateinto the bowl of London , with the rain on his face mingling with the tears again , he thought the woman in the spy 's house had said a mighty truth : It makes you hate . In war boys become men and men become soldiers and soldiers get promoted ; and this is why Bill Parkin , agedEYE OF THE NEEDLE 89eighteen , late of a boarding house in Highgate , who should have been an apprentice in his father 's tannery at Scarborough , was believed by the Army to be twenty-one , promoted to sergeant , and given the job of leading his advance squad through a hot , dry forest toward a dusty , whitewashedItalian village . The Italians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the Germans who were defending Italy against the combined British-American invasion . The Allies were going to Rome , and for Sergeant Parkin 's squad it was a long walk . They came out of the forest at the top of a hill , and lay flat on their bellies to look down on the village . Parkin got out his binoculars and said , " What would n't I fookin ' give for a fookin ' cup of fookin ' tea . " He had taken to drinking and cigarettes and women , and his language was like that of soldiers everywhere . He no longer went to prayer meetings . Some of these villages were defended and some were 6 ' ; 1 not , Parkin recognized that as sound tactics  --  you did n't know which were undefended , so you approached them all II cautiously , and caution cost time . The downside of the hill held little cover just a few ) bushes  --  and the village began at its foot . There were a few white houses , a river with a wooden bridge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a town hall and a clock tower . There was a clear line of sight from the tower to the bridge ; if the enemy were here at all , they would he in the town hall . A few figures worked in the surrounding fields ; God knew who they were . They might be genuine peasants , or any one of a host of factions : fascisti , mafia , corsos , partigianos , communisti ... or even Germans . You did n't know whose side they would be on until the shootingstarted . Parkin said , " All right , Corporal . " Corporal Watkins disappeared back into the forest and emerged , five minutes later , on the dirt road into the village , wearing a civilian hat and a filthy old blanket over his uniform . He shambled , rather than walked , and over his shoulder was a bundle that could have been anything from a bag of onions to a dead rabbit . He reached the near99 Ken Follett EYE OF THE NEEDLE 91edge of the village and vanished into the darkness of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Standing close to the wall , where he could not be seen from the village , he looked toward the soldiers on the hilltop and waved : one , two , three . The squad scrambled down the hillside into the village . " All the houses empty , Sarge , " Watkins said . Parkin nodded . It meant nothing . They moved through the houses to the edge of the river . Parkin said , " Your turn , Smiler . Swim the Mississippi here . " Private " Smiler " Hudson put his equipment in a neat pile , took off his helmet , boots and tunic , and slid into the narrow stream . He emerged on the far side , climbed the bank , and disappeared among the houses . This time there was a longer wait : more area to check . Finally Hudson walked back across the wooden bridge . " If they 're ' ere , they 're ' iding , " he said . He retrieved his gear and the squad crossed the bridge into the village . They kept to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A bird flew off a roof and startledParkin . Some of the men kicked open a few doors as they passed . There was nobody . They stood at the edge of the piazza . Parkin nodded at the town hall . " Did you go inside that place , Smiler ? " " Yes , sir . " " Looks like the village is ours , then . " " Yes , sir . " Parkin stepped forward to cross the piazza , and then it broke . There was a crash of rifles , and bullets hailed all around them . Someone screamed . Parkin was running , dodging , ducking . Watkins , in front of him , shouted with pain and clutched his leg . Parkin picked him up bodily . A bullet clanged off his tin hat . He raced for the nearest house , charged the door , and fell inside . The shooting stopped . Parkin risked a look outside . One man lay wounded in the piazza : Hudson . Hudson moved , and a solitary shot rang out . Then he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Watkins was doing something to his leg , cursing . " Bullet still in there ? " Parkin said . Watkins yelled , " Ouch ! " then grinned and held somethingup . " Not any more . " Parkin looked outside again . " They 're in the clock tower . You would n't think there was room . Ca n't be many of them . " " They can shoot , though . " " Yes . They 've got us pinned . " Parkin frowned . " Got i ' . any fireworks ? " " Aye . " " Let 's have a look . " Parkin opened Watkins 's pack and 1 , took out the dynamite . " Here . Fix a ten-second fuse . " 1 The others were in the house across the street . Parkin called out " Hey ! " A face appeared at the door . " Sarge ? " " I 'm going to throw a tomato . When I shout , give me covering fire . " " Right . " Parkin lit a cigarette . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Fire ! " He lit the fuse with the cigarette , stepped into the street , drew back his arm , and threw the bomb at the clock tower . He ducked back into the house , the fire of his own men ringing in his ears . A bullet shaved the woodwork , and he caught a splinter under his chin . He heard the dynamite explode . Before he could look , someone across the street shouted , " Bullseye ! " Parkin stepped outside . The ancient clock tower had crumbled . A chime sounded incongruously as dust settled over the ruins . Watkins said , " You ever play cricket ? That was a bloody good shot . " Parkin walked to the center of the piazza . There seemed 1 to be enough human spare parts to make about three Germans . " The tower was pretty unsteady anyway , " he said . " It would probably have fallen down if we 'd all sneezed at it together . " He turned away . " Another day , another dollar . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Sarge ? Radio . " It was the R/T operator . Parkin walked back and took the handset from him . " Sergeant Parkin . " " Major Roberts . You 're discharged from active duty as of now , Sergeant . " " W by ? " Parkin 's first thought was that they had discovered his true age . " The brass want you in London . Do n't ask me why because I do n't know . Leave your corporal in charge and make your way back to base . A car will meet you on the road . " " Yes , sir . " " The orders also say that on no account are you to risk your life . Got that ? " Parkin grinned , thinking of the clock tower and the dynamite . " Got it . " " All right . On your way . You lucky sod . " Everyone had called him a boy , but they had known him before he joined the Army , Bloggs thought . There was no doubt he was a man now . He walked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and was respectful without being ill at ease in the company of superior officers . Bloggs knew that he was lying about his age , not because of his looks or manner , but because of the small signs that appearedwhenever age was mentioned  --  signs that Bloggs , an experienced interrogator , picked up out of habit . He had been amused when they told him they wanted him to look at pictures . Now , in this third day in Mr. Middleton'sdusty Kensington vault , the amusement had gone and tedium had set in . What irritated him most was the nosmokingrule . It was even more boring for Bloggs , who had to sit and watch him . At one point Parkin said , " You would n't call me back from Italy to help you in a four-year-old murder case that could wait until after the war . Also , these pictures are mostly of German officers . If this case is something I should keep quiet about , you 'd better tell me . " " It 's something you should keep quiet about , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They were all old , mostly browned and fading . Many were out of books , magazines , and newspapers . Sometimes Parkin picked up a magnifying glass Mr. Middleton had thoughtfully provided , to peer more closely at a tiny  --  face in a group ; and each time this happened Bloggs 's heart raced , only to slow down when Parkin put the glass to one side and picked up the next photograph . They went to a nearby pub for lunch . The ale was weak , like most wartime beer , but Bloggs still thought it was wise to restrict young Parkin to two pints  --  on his own he would have sunk a gallon . " Mr. Faber was the quiet sort , " Parkin said . " You would n't think he had it in him . Mind you , the landlady was n't bad looking . And she wanted it . Looking back , I think I could have had her myself if I 'd known how to go about it . There , I was only  --  eighteen . " They ate bread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When they went back , they stopped outside the house while Parkin smoked another cigarette . " Mind you , " he said , " he was a biggish chap , good-looking , well-spoken . We all thought he was nothing much because his clothes were poor , and he rode a bike , and he 'd no money . I suppose it could have been a subtle kind of disguise . " His eyebrows were raised in a question . " It could have been , " Bloggs said . That afternoon Parkin found not one but three pictures of Faber . One of them was only nine years old . And Mr. Middleton had the negative . Heinrich Rudolph Hans von Muller-Gilder ( also known as Faber ) was born on May 26 , 1900 , at a village called Oln in West Prussia . His father 's family had been substantial landowners in the area for generations . His father was the second son ; so was Heinrich . All the second sons were Army officers . His mother , the daughter of a senior official of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an aristocrat'swife , and that was what she was . At the age of thirteen Heinrich went to the Karlsruhe cadet school in Baden ; two years later he was transferred to the more prestigious Gross-Lichterfelde , near Berlin . Both places were hard disciplinarian institutions where the minds94 Ken Follett EYE OF THE NEEDLE 95of the pupils were improved with canes and cold baths and had food . However , Heinrich learned to speak English and French and studied history , and passed the final examinationswith the highest mark recorded since the turn of the century . There were only three other points of note in his school career : one bitter winter he rebeled against authority to the extent of sneaking out of the school at night and walking 150 miles to his aunt 's house ; he broke the arm of his wrestling instructor during a practice bout ; and he was flogged for insubordination . He served briefly as an ensign-cadet in the neutral zone of Friedrichsfeld , near Wesel , in 1920 ; did token officer training at the War School at Metz in 1921 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the phrase you used ? " Godliman asked Bloggs . " The German equivalent of Eton and Sandhurst . " ) Over the next few years he did short tours of duty in half a dozen places , in the manner of one who is being groomed for the general staff . He continued to distinguish himself as an athlete , specializing in long-distance running . He made no close friendships , never married , and refused to join the National Socialist party . His promotion to lieutenantwas somewhat delayed by a vague incident involving the pregnancy of the daughter of a lieutenant colonel in the Defense Ministry , but eventually came about in 1928 . His habit of talking to superior officers as if they were equals came to be accepted as pardonable in one who was both a rising young officer and a Prussian aristocrat . In the late ' 20s Admiral Wilhelm Canaris became friendly with Heinrich 's Uncle Otto , his father 's elder brother , and spent several holidays at the family estate in Oln . In 1931 Adolf Hitler , not yet Chancellor of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was promoted to captain , and went to Berlin for unspecified duties . This is the date of the last photograph . About then , according to published information , he seems to have ceased to exist .... " We can conjecture the rest , " said Percival Godliman . " The Abwehr trains him in wireless transmission , codes , map-making , burglary , blackmail , sabotage and silent killing . He comes to London in about 1937 with plenty of time to set himself up with a solid cover  --  perhaps two . His loner instincts are honed sharp by the spying game . When war breaks out , he considers himself licensed to kill . " He looked at the photograph on his desk . " He 's a handsome fellow . " It was a picture of the 5,000-meters running team of the 10th Hanoverian Jaeger Battalion . Faber was in the middle , holding a cup . He had a high forehead , with cropped hair , a long chin , and a small mouth decorated with a narrow moustache . Godliman passed the picture to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He looked a lot older , but that might have been his .. . bearing . " He studied the photograph thoughtfully . " His hair was longer , and the moustache was gone . " He passed the picture back across the desk . " But it 's him , all right . " " There are two more items in the file , both of them conjectural , " Godliman said . " First , they say he may have gone into Intelligence in 1933  --  that 's the routine assumption when an officer 's record just stops for no apparent reason . The second item is a rumor , unconfirmed by any reliable source , that he spent some years as a confidential advisor to Stalin , using the name Vasily Zankov . " " That 's incredible , " Bloggs said . " I do n't believe that . " Godliman shrugged . " Somebody persuaded Stalin to executethe cream of his officer corps during the years Hitler rose to power . " Bloggs shook his head , and changed the subject . " Where do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Let 's have Sergeant Parkin transferred to us . He 's the only man we know who has actually seen Die Nadel .

" Bloggs said doubtfully . " No . For now , let 's tread softly . If we put the thing in96 Ken Follettthe newspapers he 'll get to hear of it and vanish . Just send the photo to police forces for the time being . " " Is that all ? " " I think so . Unless you 've got other ideas . " Parkin cleared his throat . " Sir ? " " Yes .

At this stage , one Italian village more or less makes relatively little difference  --  but this man Faber could lose us the war . Truly . " IIFaber had gone fishing . He was stretched out on the deck of a thirty-foot boat , enjoying the spring sunshine , moving along the canal at about three knots . One lazy hand held the tiller , the other rested on a rod that trailed its line in the water behind the boat . He had n't caught a thing all day . As well as fishing , he was bird-watching  --  both out of interest ( he was actually getting to know quite a lot about the damn birds ) and as an excuse for carrying binoculars . Earlier today he had seen a kingfisher 's nest . The people at the boatyard in Norwich had been delighted to rent him the vessel for a fortnight . Business was bad  --  they had only two boats nowadays , and one of them had not been used since Dunkirk . Faber had haggled over the price , just for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thrown in a locker full of tinned food . He had bought bait in a shop nearby ; the fishing tackle he had brought from London . They had observed that he had nice weather for it , and wished him good fishing . Nobodyasked to see his identity card . So far , so good . The difficult bit was to come . For assessing the strength of an army was difficult . First , for example , you had to find it . In peacetime the Army would put up its own road signs to help you . Now they had been taken down , not only the Army 's but everyone else 's road signs . The simple solution would be to get in a car and follow the first military vehicle you saw until it stopped . However , Faber had no car ; it was close to impossible for a civilian98 Ken Follett EYE OF THE NEEDLE 99to hire one , and even if you got one you could n't get petrol for it . Besides , a civilian driving around the countryside following Army vehicles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Hence the boat . Some years ago , before it had become illegal to sell maps , Faber had discovered that Britain had thousands of miles of inland waterways . The original network of rivers had been augmented during the nineteenth century by a spider web of canals . In some areas there was almost as much waterway as there was road . Norfolk was one of these areas . The boat had many advantages . On a road , a man was going somewhere ; on a river he was just sailing . Sleeping in a parked car was conspicuous ; sleeping in a moored boat was natural . The waterway was lonely . And who ever heard of a canal-block ? There were disadvantages . Airfields and barracks had to be near roads , but they were located without reference to access by water . Faber had to explore the countryside at night , leaving his moored boat and tramping the hillsides by moonlight , exhausting forty-mile round trips during which he could easily miss what he was looking for because of the darkness or because he simply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of land . When he returned , a couple of hours after dawn , he would sleep until midday , then move on , stopping occasionally to climb a nearby hill and check the outlook . At locks , isolated farmhouses and riverside pubs he would talk to people , hoping for hints of a military presence . So far there had been none . He was beginning to wonder whether he was in the right area . He had tried to put himself in General Patton 's place , thinking : If I were planning to invade France east of the Seine from a base in eastern England , where would I locate that base ? Norfolk was obvious : a vast expanse of lonely countryside , plenty of flat ground for aircraft , close to the sea for rapid departure . And the Wash was a natural place to gather a fleet of ships . However , his guesswork might be wrong for reasons unknown to him . Soon he would haveto consider a rapid move across country to a new area  --  perhaps the Fens . A lock appeared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slow his pace . He glided gently into the lock and bumped softly against the gates . The lock-keeper 's house was on the bank . Faber cupped hands around his mouth and halloed . Then he settled down to wait . He had learned that lock-keepers were a breed that could not be hurried . Moreover , it was tea time , and at tea time they could hardly be moved at all . A woman came to the door of the house and beckoned . Faber waved back , then jumped onto the bank , tied up the boat and went into the house . The lock-keeper was in his shirtsleeves at the kitchen table . He said , " Not in a hurry , are you ? " Faber smiled . " Not at all . " " Pour him a cup of tea , Mavis . " " No , really , " Faber said politely . " It 's all right , we 've just made a pot . " " Thank you . " Faber sat down . The little kitchen was airy and clean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Fishing holiday ? " the lock-keeper asked . " Fishing and bird-watching , " Faber answered . " I 'm thinking of tying up quite soon and spending a couple of days on land . " " Oh , aye . Well , best keep to the far side of the canal , then . Restricted area this side . " " Really ? I did n't know there was Army land here-abouts . " " Aye , it starts about half a mile from here . As to whetherit 's Army , I would n't know . They do n't tell me . " " Well , I suppose we do n't need to know , " Faber said . " Aye . Drink up , then , and I 'll see you through the lock . Thanks for letting me finish my tea . " They left the house , and Faber got into the boat and untied it . The gates behind him closed slowly , and then the keeper opened the sluices . The boat gradually sank with the level of the water in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Faber made sail and moved out . The lock-keeper waved . He stopped again about four miles away and moored the100 Ken Follett EYE OF THE NEEDLE 101 boat to a stout tree on the bank . While he waited for night to fall he made a meal of tinned sausage meat , dry biscuits , and bottled water . He dressed in his black clothes , put into a shoulder bag his binoculars , camera , and copy of Rare Birds of East Anglia , pocketed his compass and picked up his flashlight . He was ready . He doused the hurricane lamp , locked the cabin door and jumped onto the bank . Consulting his compass by flashlight , he entered the belt of woodland along the canal . He walked due south from his boat for about half a mile until he came to the fence . It was six feet high , chicken wire , with coiled barbed wire on top . He backtracked into the wood and climbed a tall tree . There was scattered cloud above . The moon showed through fitfully . Beyond the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had done this sort of thing before , at Biggin Hill , Aldershot , and a host of military areas all over south- ern England . There were two levels of security : a mobile patrol around the perimeter fence , and stationary sentries at the installations . Both , he felt , could be evaded by patience and caution . Faber came down the tree and returned to the fence . He concealed himself behind a bush and settled down to wait . He had to know when the mobile patrol passed this point . If they did not come until dawn he would simply return the following night . If he was lucky they would pass shortly . From the apparent size of the area under guard he guessed they would only make one complete tour of the fence each night . He was lucky . Soon after ten o'clock he heard the tramp of feet , and three men marched by on the inside of the fence . Five minutes later Faber crossed the fence . He walked due south ; when all directions are equal , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flashlight . He kept close to hedges and trees when he could , and avoided high ground where he might be silhouetted against a sudden flash of moonlight . The sparse countryside was an abstract in black , grey and silver . The ground underfoot was a little soggy , as if there might be marshes nearby . A fox ran across a field in front of him , as fast as a greyhound , as graceful as a cat . It was 11:30 p.m. when he came across the first indications of military activity  --  and very odd indications they were . The moon came out and he saw , perhaps a quarter of a mile ahead , several rows of one-story buildings laid out with the unmistakable precision of an Army barracks . He dropped to the ground immediately , but he was already doubting the reality of what he apparently saw ; for there were no lights and no noise . He lay still for ten minutes , to give explanations a chance to emerge , but nothing happened except that a badger lumberedinto view , saw him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he got closer he realized that the barracks were not just unoccupied , but unfinished . Most of them were little more than a roof supported by cornerposts . Some had one wall . A sudden sound stopped him : a man 's laugh . He lay still and watched . A match flared briefly and died , leaving two glowing red spots in one of the unfinished huts  --  guards . Faber touched the stiletto in his sleeve , then began to crawl again , making for the side of the camp away from the sentries . The half-built huts had no floors and no foundations . There were no construction vehicles around , no wheel-barrows , concrete mixers , shovels or piles of bricks . A mud track led away from the camp across the fields , but spring grass was growing in the ruts ; it had not been used much lately . It was as if someone had decided to billet 10,000 men here , then changed his mind a few weeks after building started . Yet there was something about the place that did not quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lest the sentries should take it into their heads to make a patrol . There was a group of military vehicles in the center of the camp . They were old and rusting , and had been degutted  --  none had an engineor any interior components . But if one was going to102 Ken Follett EYE OF THE NEEDLE 103cannibalize obsolete vehicles , why not take the shells for scrap ? Those huts which did have a wall were on the outermost rows , and their walls faced out . It was like a movie set , not a building site . Faber decided he had learned all he could from this place . He walked to the east edge of the camp , then dropped to his hands and knees and crawled away until he was out of sight behind a hedge . Half a mile farther on , near the top of a rise , he looked back . Now it looked exactly like a barracks again . The glimmer of an idea formed in his mind . He gave it time . The land was still relatively flat , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woodland and marshy scrub that Faber took advantage of . Once he had to detour around a lake , its surface a silver mirror under the moon . He heard the hoot of an owl , and looked in that direction to see a tumbledown barn in the distance . Five miles on he saw the airfield . There were more planes here than he thought were possessedby the entire Royal Air Force . There were Pathfindersto drop flares , Lancasters and American B-17s for softening-up bombing , Hurricanes and Spitfires and Mosquitoesfor reconnaissance and strafing ; enough planes for an invasion . Without exception their undercarriages had sunk into the soft earth and they were up to their bellies in mud . Once again there were no lights and no noise . Faber followed the same procedure , crawling flat toward the planes until he located the guards . In the middle of the airfield was a small tent . The faint glow of a lamp shone through the canvas . Two men , perhaps three . As Faber approached the planes they seemed to become flatter , as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and touched it in amazement . It was a piece of half-inch plywood , cut out in the outline of a Spitfire , painted with camouflage , and roped to the ground . Every other plane was the same . There were more than a thousand of them . Faber got to his feet , watching the tent from the corner of his eye , ready to drop to the ground at the slightest sign of movement . He walked all around the phony airfield , looking at the phony fighters and bombers , connecting them with the movie-set barracks , reeling at the implicationsof what he had found . He knew that if he continued to explore he would find more airfields like this , more half-built barracks . If he went to the Wash he would find a fleet of plywood destroyers and troop ships . It was a vast , meticulous , costly , outrageous trick . Of course it could not possibly fool an onlooker for very long . But it was not designed to deceive observers on the ground . It was meant to be seen from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the latest cameras and fast film would come back with picturesthat indisputably showed an enormous concentration of men and machines . No wonder the general staff was anticipating an invasion east of the Seine . There would be other elements to the deception , he guessed . The British would refer to FUSAG in signals , using codes they knew to be broken . There would be phony espionage reports channeled through the Spanish diplomaticbag to Hamburg . The possibilities were endless . The British had had four years to arm themselves for this invasion . Most of the German army was fighting Russia . Once the Allies got a toehold on French soil they would be unstoppable . The Germans ' only chance was to catch them on the beaches and annihilate them as they came off the troop ships . If they were waiting in the wrong place , they would lose that one chance . The whole strategy was immediately clear . It was simple , and it was devastating . Faber had to tell Hamburg . He wondered whether they would believe him . War strategy was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own standing was high , but was it that high ? That idiot Von Braun would never believe him . He'dhated Faber for years and would grab at the opportunity104 Ken FoIlett EYE OF THE NEEDLE 105to discredit him . Canaris , Von Roenne ... he had no faith in them . And there was another thing : the radio . He did n't want to trust this to the radio ... he 'd had the feeling for weeks now that the radio code was n't safe anymore . If the British found out that their secret was blown ... There was only one thing to do : he had to get proof , and he had to take it himself to Berlin . He needed photographs . He would take photographs of this gigantic dummy army , then he would go to Scotland and meet the U-boat , and he would deliver the pictures personally to the Fuehrer . He could do no more . No less . For photography he needed light . He would have to wait until dawn . There had been a ruined barn a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night there . He checked his compass and set off . The barn was farther than he thought , and the walk took him an hour . It was an old wooden building with holes in the roof . The rats had long ago deserted it for lack of food , but there were bats in the hayloft . Faber lay down on some planks but he could not sleep . Not with the knowledge that he was now personally capable of altering the course of the war . Dawn was due at 05:21 . At 04:20 Faber left the barn . Although he had not slept , the two hours had rested his body and calmed his mind , and he was now in fine spirits . The cloud was clearing with a west wind , so although the moon had set there was starlight . His timing was good . The sky was growing perceptibly brighter as he came in sight of the " airfield . " The sentries were still in their tent . With luck , they would be sleeping . Faber knew from his own experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during the last few hours . But if they did come out , he would have to kill them . He selected his position and loaded the Leica with a 36- frame roll of 35mm fast Agfa film . He hoped the film 's light-sensitive chemicals had not spoiled ; it had been stored in his suitcase since before the war , and you could n't buy film in Britain nowadays . It should be all right ; he had kept it in a lightproof bag away from any heat . When the red rim of the sun edged over the horizon he began shooting . He took a series of shots from different vantage points and various distances , finishing with a closeupof one dummy plane ; the pictures would show both the illusion and the reality . As he took the last , he saw movement from the corner of his eye . He dropped flat and crawled under a plywood Mosquito . A soldier emerged from the tent , walked a few paces , and urinated on the ground . The man stretched and yawned , then lit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and returned to the tent . Faber got up and ran . A quarter of a mile away he looked back . The airfield was out of sight . He headed west , toward the barracks . This would be more than an ordinary espionage coup . Hitler had had a life of being the only one in step . The man who brought the proof that , yet again , the Fuehrer was right and all the experts were wrong , could look for more than a pat on the back . Faber knew that already Hitler rated him the Abwehr 's best agent  --  this triumph might well get him Canaris 's job . If he made it . He increased his pace , jogging twenty yards , walking the next twenty , and jogging again , so that he reached the barracksby 06:30 . It was bright daylight now , and he could not approach close because these sentries were not in a tent but in one of the wall-less huts with a clear view all around them . He lay down by the hedge and took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a barracks , but big enlargements ought to reveal the details of the deception . When he headed back toward the boat he had exposed thirty frames . Again he hurried , because he was now terriblyconspicuous , a black-clad man carrying a canvas bag of equipment , jogging across the open fields of a restricted area . He reached the fence an hour later , having seen nothing but wild geese . As he climbed over the wire , he felt a great release of tension . Inside the fence the balance of suspicionhad been against him ; outside it was in his favor . He could revert to his bird-watching , fishing , sailing role . The period of greatest risk was over . He strolled through the belt of woodland , catching his breath and letting the strain of the night 's work seep away . He would sail a few miles on , he decided , before mooring again to catch a few hours ' sleep . He reached the canal . It was over . The boat looked pretty in the morning sunshine . As soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , thenA man in uniform stepped out of the cabin of the boat and said : " Well , well . And who might you be ? " Faber stood still , letting the icy calm and the old instincts come into play . The intruder wore the uniform of a captain in the Home Guard . He had some kind of handgun in a holster with a buttoned flap . He was tall and rangy , but he looked to be in his late fifties . White hair showed under his cap . He made no move to draw his gun . Faber took all this in as he said , " You are on my boat , so I think it is I who should ask who you are . " " Captain Stephen Langham , Home Guard . " " James Baker . " Faber stayed on the bank . A captain did not patrol alone . " And what are you doing ? " " I 'm on holiday . " " Where have you been ? " " Bird-watching . " " Since before dawn ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ denim uniform appeared on Faber 's left , carrying a shotgun . Faber looked around . There was another man to his right and a fourth behind him . The captain called , " Which direction did he come from , corporal ? " The reply came from the top of an oak tree . " From the restricted area , sir . " Faber was calculating odds . Four to one  --  until the corporalcame down from the tree . They had only two guns , the shotgun and the captain 's pistol . And they were basically amateurs . The boat would help too . He said , " Restricted area ? All I saw was a bit of fence . Look , do you mind pointing that blunderbuss away ? It might go off . " " Nobody goes bird-watching in the dark , " the captain said . " If you set up your hide under cover of darkness , you 're concealed by the time the birds wake up . It 's the accepted way to do it . Now look , the Home Guard is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's not take it too far . Do n't you just have to check my papers and file a report ? " The captain was looking a shade doubtful . " What 's in that canvas bag ? " " Binoculars , a camera , and a reference book . " Faber 's hand went to the bag . " No , you do n't , " the captain said . " Look inside it , Watson . " There it was  --  the amateur 's error . Watson said , " Raise your hands . " Faber raised his hands above his head , his right hand close to the left sleeve of his jacket . Faber choreographed the next few seconds  --  there must be no gunfire . Watson came up on Faber 's left side , pointing the shotgunat him , and opened the flap of Faber 's canvas bag . Faber drew the stiletto from his sleeve , moved inside Watson'sguard , and plunged the knife into Watson 's neck up to the hilt . Faber 's other hand twisted the shotgun out of the young man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moved toward him , and the corporal began to crash down through the branches of the oak . Faber tugged the stiletto out of Watson 's neck as the man collapsed to the ground . The captain was fumbling at the flap of his holster . Faber leaped into the well of the boat . It rocked , sending the captain staggering . Faber struck at him with the knife , but the man was too far away for an accurate thrust . The point caught in the lapel of his uniform jacket , then jerked up , slashing his chin . His hand came away from the holster to clutch the wound . Faber whipped around to face the bank . One of the soldiersjumped . Faber stepped forward and held his right arm out rigidly . The leaping soldier impaled himself on the eight-inch stiletto . The impact knocked Faber off his feet , and he lost his grip on the stiletto . The soldier fell on top of the weapon . Faber got to his knees ; there was no time to retrieve the stiletto , the captain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hands going for the officer 's face . The gun came out . Faber 's thumbs gouged at the eyes of the captain , who screamed in pain and tried to push Faber 's arms aside . There was a thud as the fourth guardsman landed in the well of the boat . Faber turned from the captain , who would now be unable to see to fire his pistol even if he could get the safety off . The fourth man held a policeman 's truncheon ; he brought it down hard . Faber shifted to the right so that the blow missed his head and caught his left shoulder . His left arm momentarily went nerveless . He chopped the man 's neck with the side of his hand , a powerful , accurateblow . Amazingly the man survived it and brought his truncheon up for a second swipe . Faber closed in . The feelingreturned to his left arm , and it began to hurt mightily . He took the soldier 's face in both his hands , pushed , twisted , and pushed again . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At the same instant the truncheon landed again , this time on Faber 's head . He reeled away , dazed . The captain bumped into him , still staggering . Faber pushed him . His cap went flying as he stumbled backward over the gunwale and fell into the canal with a huge splash . The corporal jumped the last six feet from the oak tree onto the ground . Faber retrieved his stiletto from the impaledguard and leaped to the bank . Watson was still alive , but it would not be for long  --  blood was pumping out of the wound in his neck . Faber and the corporal faced each other . The corporal had a gun . He was understandably terrified . In the seconds it had taken him to climb down the oak tree this man had killed three of his mates and thrown the fourth into the canal . Faber looked at the gun . It was old  --  almost like a museum piece . If the corporal had any confidence in it , he would already have fired it . The corporal took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his right leg  --  perhaps he had hurt it coming outof the tree . Faber stepped sideways , forcing the corporal to put his weight on the weak leg as he swung to keep his gun on the target . Faber got the toe of his shoe under a stone and kicked upward . The corporal 's attention flicked to the stone , and Faber moved . The corporal pulled the trigger ; nothing happened . The old gun had jammed . Even if it had fired , he would have missed Faber ; his eyes were on the stone , he stumbled on the weak leg , and Faber had moved . Faber killed him with the neck stab . Only the captain was left . Faber looked , and saw the man clambering out of the water on the far bank . He found a stone and threw it . It hit the captain 's head , but the man heaved himself onto dry land and began to run . Faber ran to the bank , dived in , swam a few strokes , and came up on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and running , but he was old . Faber gained steadily until he could hear the man 's agonized , ragged breathing . The captain slowed , then collapsed into a bush . Faber came up to him and turned him over . The captain said , " You 're a ... devil . " " You saw my face , " Faber said , and killed him. iThe Ju-52 trimotor transport plane with swastikas on the wings bumped to a halt on the rain-wet runway at Rastenburgin the East Prussian forest . A small man with big features  --  a large nose , a wide mouth , big ears  --  disembarkedand walked quickly across the tarmac to a waiting Mercedes car . As the car drove through the gloomy , damp forest , Field Marshal Erwin Rommel took off his cap and rubbed a nervoushand along his receding hairline . In a few weeks time , he knew , another man would travel this route with a bomb in his briefcase  --  a bomb destined for the Fuehrer himself . Meanwhile the fight must go on , so that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  could negotiate with the Allies from a reasonably strong position . At the end of a ten-mile drive the car arrived at the Wolfsschanze , the Wolves ' Lair , headquarters now for Hitlerand the increasingly tight , neurotic circle of generals who surrounded him . There was a steady drizzle , and raindrops dripped from the tall conifers in the compound . At the gate to Hitler 's personal quarters , Rommel put on his cap and got out of the car . Oberfuehrer Rattenhuber , the chief of the SS bodyguard , wordlessly held out his hand to receive Rommel 's pistol . The conference was to be held in the underground bunker , a cold , damp , airless shelter lined with concrete . Rommelwent down the steps and entered . There were a dozen or so there already , waiting for the noon meeting : Himmler , Goering , von Ribbentrop , Keitel . Rommel nodded greetingsand sat on a hard chair to wait . They all stood when Hitler entered . He wore a grey tunicEYE OF THE NEEDLE 111and black trousers , and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straight to the far end of the bunker , where a large wall map of northwestern Europe was tacked to the concrete . He looked tired and irritable . He spoke without preamble . " There will be an Allied invasion of Europe . It will come this year . It will be launched from Britain , with English and American troops . They will land in France . We will destroy them at the high-water mark . On this there is no room for discussion . " He looked around , as if daring his staff to contradict him . There was silence . Rommel shivered ; the bunker was as cold as death . " The question is , where will they land ? Von Roenneyourreport . " Colonel Alexis von Roenne , who had taken over , effectively , from Canaris , got to his feet . A mere captain at the outbreak of war , he had distinguished himself with a superb report on the weaknesses of the French army  --  a report that had been called a decisive factor in the German victory . He had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that bureau had absorbed the Abwehr on the fall of Canaris . Rommel had heard that he was proud and outspoken , but able . Von Roenne said , " Our information is extensive , but by no means complete . The Allies ' code name for the invasion is Overlord . Troop concentrations in Britain are as follows . " He picked up a pointer and crossed the room to the wall map . " First : along the south coast . Second : here in the district known as East Anglia . Third : in Scotland . The East Anglian concentration is by far the greatest . We conclude that the invasion will be three-pronged . First : a diversionary attack on Normandy . Second : the main thrust , across the Strait of Dover to the Calais coast . Third : a flanking invasionfrom Scotland across the North Sea to Norway . All intelligence sources support this prognosis . " He sat down . Hitler said , " Comments ?

" 112 Ken Follett EYE OF THE NEEDLE 113Goering said , " What intelligence sources support your prognosis , Von Roenne ? " Von Roenne stood up again . " There are three : air reconnaissance , monitoring of enemy wireless signals and the reportsof agents . " He sat down . Hitler crossed his hands protectively in front of his genitals , a nervous habit that was a sign that he was about to make a speech . " I shall now tell you , " he began , " how I would be thinking if I were Winston Churchill . Two choices confront me : east of the Seine , or west of the Seine . East has one advantage : it is nearer . But in modern warfare there are only two distances  --  within fighter range and outsidefighter range . Both of these choices are within fighter range . Therefore distance is not a consideration . " West has a great port  --  Cherbourg  --  but east has none . And most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The enemy too has air reconnaissance . " So , I would choose west . And what would I do then ? I would try to make the Germans think the opposite ! I would send two bombers to the Pas de Calais for every one to Normandy . I would try to knock out every bridge over the Seine . I would put out misleading wireless signals , send false intelligence reports , dispose my troops in a misleading fashion . I would deceive fools like Rommel and von Roenne . I would hope to deceive the Fuehrer himself ! " Goering spoke first after a lengthy silence . " My Fuehrer , I believe you flatter Churchill by crediting him with ingenuityequal to your own . " There was a noticeable easing of tension in the uncomfortablebunker . Goering had said exactly the right thing , managing to voice his disagreement in the form of a compliment . The others followed him , each stating the case a little more strongly  --  the Allies would choose the shorter sea crossing for speed ; the closer coast would allow the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the southeast was a better launch pad , with more estuaries and harbors ; it was unlikely that all the intelligence reports would be wrong . Hitler listened for half an hour , then held up his hands for silence . He picked up a yellowing sheaf of papers from the table and waved them . " In 1941 , " he said , " I issued mydirective Construction of Coastal Defenses , in which I forecastthat the decisive landing of the Allies would come at the protruding parts of Normandy and Brittany , where the excellent harbors would make ideal beachheads . That was what my intuition told me then , and that is what it tells me now ! " A fleck of foam appeared on the Fuehrer 's lower lip . Von Roenne spoke up . ( He has more courage than I , Rommel thought . ) " My Fuehrer , our investigations continue , quite naturally , and there is one particular line of inquiry that you should know about . I have in recent weeks sent an emissary to England to contact the agent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Ah ! I know the man . Go on . " " Die Nadel 's orders are to assess the strength of the First United States Army Group under General Patton in East Anglia . If he finds that this has been exaggerated , we must surely reconsider our prognosis . If , however , he reports that the army is as strong as we presently believe , there can be little doubt that Calais is the target . " Goering looked at von Roenne . " Who is this Nadel ? " Hitler answered the question . " The only decent agent Canaris ever recruited  --  because he recruited him at my direction . I know his family  --  strong , loyal , upright Germans . And Die Nadel  --  a brilliant man , brilliant ! I see all his reports . He has been in London since  --  " Von Roenne interrupted : " My Fuehrer  --  " Hitler glared at him . " Well ? " Von Roenne said tentatively , " Then you will accept Die Nadel 's report ? " Hitler nodded . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against a tree , shivering , and threw up . Then he considered whether he should bury the five dead men . It would take between thirty and sixty minutes , he estimated , depending on how well he concealed the bodies . During that time he might be caught . He had to weigh that risk against the precious hours he might gain by delaying the discovery of the deaths . The five men would be missed very soon  --  there would be a search under way by around nine o'clock . Assuming they were on a regular patrol , their route would be known . The searchers ' first move would be to send a runner to cover the route . If the bodies were left as they were , he would see them and raise the alarm . Otherwise , he would report back and a full-scale search would be mounted , with bloodhoundsand policemen beating the bushes . It might take them all day to discover the corpses . By that time Faber could be in London . It was important for him to be out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ murderer . He decided to risk the additional hour . He swam back across the canal with the elderly captain across his shoulder , dumped him unceremoniously behind a bush , then retrieved the two bodies from the well of the boat and piled them on top of the captain . Next he added Watson and the corporal to the heap . He had no spade and he needed a big grave . He found a patch of loose earth a few yards into the wood . The ground there was slightly hollowed , to give him an advantage . He got a saucepan from the boat 's tiny galley and began to dig . For a couple of feet there was just leaf mold , and the going was easy . Then he got down to clay and digging be-118 Ken Follettcame extremely difficult . In half an hour he had added only another eighteen inches of depth to the hole . It would have to do . He carried the bodies to the hole one by one and threw them in . Then he took off his muddy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the grave with loose earth and a layer of foliage ripped from nearby bushes and trees . It should be good enough to pass that first superficialinspection . He kicked earth over the patch of ground near the bank where the life-blood of Watson had poured out . There was blood in the boat , too , where the impaled soldier had lain . Faber found a rag and swabbed down the deck . Then he put on clean clothes , made sail , and moved off . He did not fish or watch birds ; this was no time for pleasantembellishments to his cover . Instead he piled on the sail , putting as much distance as possible between himself and the grave . He had to get off the water and into some faster transport as soon as possible . He reflected , as he sailed , on the relative merits of catching a train and stealing a car . A car was faster , if one could be found to steal ; but the search for it might start quite soon , regardless of whether the theft was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ railway station might take a long time , but it seemed safer ; if he were careful he could escape suspicion for most of the day . He wondered what to do about the boat . Ideally he would scuttle it , but he might be seen doing so . If he left it in a harbor somewhere , or simply moored at the canalside , the police would connect it with the murders that much sooner ; and that would tell them in which direction he was moving . He postponed the decision . Unfortunately , he was not sure where he was . His map of England 's waterways gave every bridge , harbor and lock ; but it did not show railway lines . He calculated he was within an hour or two 's walk of half a dozen villages , but a village did not necessarily mean a station . The two problems were solved at once ; the canal went under a railway bridge . He took his compass , the film from the camera , his walleEYE OF THE NEEDLE 119and his stiletto . All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The towpath on both sides was shaded with trees , and there were no roads nearby . He furled the sails , dismantled the base of the mast , and laid the pole on the deck . Then he removed the bung-hole stopper from the keel and stepped on to the bank , holding the rope . Gradually filling with water , the boat drifted under the bridge . Faber hauled on the rope to hold the vessel in positiondirectly under the brick arch as it sank . The afterdeck went under first , the prow followed , and finally the water of the canal closed over the roof of the cabin . There were a few bubbles , then nothing . The outline of the boat was hidden from a casual glance by the shadow of the bridge . Faber threw the rope in . The railway line ran northeast to southwest . Faber climbed the embankment and walked southwest , which was the direction in which London lay . It was a two-line track , probably a rural branch line . There would be a few trains , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stronger as he walked , and the exertion made him hot . When he had buried his bloodstained black clothes he had put on a double-breasted blazer and heavy flannel trousers . Now he took off the blazer and slung it over his shoulder . After forty minutes he heard a distant chuff-chuff-chuff and hid in a bush beside the line . An old steam engine went slowly by , heading northeast , puffing great clouds of smoke and hauling a train of coal trucks . If one came by in the opposite direction , he could jump it . Should he ? It would save him a long walk . On the other hand , he would get conspicuously dirty and he might have trouble disembarkingwithout being seen . No , it was safer to walk . The line ran straight as an arrow across the flat countryside . Faber passed a farmer , ploughing a field with a tractor . There was no way to avoid being seen . The farmer waved to him without stopping in his work . He was too far away to get a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ten miles when he saw a station ahead . It was half a mile away , and all he could see was the rise of the platforms and a cluster of signals . He left120 Ken Follett the line and cut across the fields , keeping close to borders of trees , until he met a road . Within a few minutes he entered the village . There was nothing to tell him its name . Now that the threat of inva- sion was a memory , sign-posts and place-names were being re-erected , but this village had not got around to it . There was a Post Office , a Corn Store , and a pub called The Bull . A woman with a pram gave him a friendly " Good morning ! " as he passed the War Memorial . The little sta- tion basked sleepily in the spring sunshine . Faber went in . A timetable was pasted to a notice-board . Faber stood in front of it . From behind the little ticket window a voice said : " I should n't take any notice of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work of fiction since The Forsyte Saga . " Faber had known the timetable would be out of date , but he had needed to establish whether the trains went to London . They did . He said , " Any idea what time the next train leaves for Liverpool Street ? " The clerk laughed sarcastically . " Sometime today , if you 're lucky . " " I 'll buy a ticket anyway . Single , please . " " Five-and-fourpence . They say the Italian trains run on time , " the clerk said . " Not anymore , " Faber remarked . " Anyway , I 'd rather have bad trains and our politics . " The man shot him a nervous look . " You 're right , of course . Do you want to wait in The Bull ? You 'll hear the train  --  or , if not , I 'll send for you . " Faber did not want more people to see his face . " No , thanks , I 'd only spend money . " He took his ticket and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few minutes later , and sat on the bench beside him in the sunshine . He said , " You in a hurry ? " Faber shook his head . " I 've written today off . I got up late , I quarreled with the boss , and the truck that gave me a lift broke down . " " One of those days . Ah , well . " The clerk looked at his watch . " She went up on time this morning , and what goes up must come down , they say . You might be lucky . " He went back into his office . EYE , UF ' " 1'HE N1 WLL 1G1Faber was lucky . The train came twenty minutes later . It was crowded with farmers , families , businessmen and soldiers . Faber found a space on the floor close to a window . As the train lumbered away , he picked up a discarded twoday-oldnewspaper , borrowed a pencil , and started to do the crossword . He was proud of his ability to do crosswords in English  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ language . After a while the motion of the train lulled him into a shallow sleep , and he dreamed . It was a familiar dream , the dream of his arrival in London . He had crossed from France , carrying a Belgian passport that said he was Jan van Gelder , a representative for Phillips ( which would explain his suitcase radio if Customs opened it ) . His English then was fluent but not colloquial . The Customs had not bothered him ; he was an ally . He had caught the train to London . In those days there had been plenty of empty seats in the carriages , and you could get a meal . Faber had dined on roast beef and Yorkshire pudding . It amused him . He had talked with a history studentfrom Cardiff about the European political situation . The dream was like the reality until the train stopped at Waterloo . Then it turned into a nightmare . The trouble started at the ticket barrier . Like all dreams it had its own weird illogicality . The document they queried was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The collector said , " This is an Abwehr ticket . " " No , it is not , " said Faber , speaking with a ludicrously thick German accent . What had happened to his dainty English consonants ? They would not come . " I have it in Dover gekauft . " Damn , that did it . But the ticket collector , who had turned into a London policeman complete with helmet , seemed to ignore the suddenlapse into German . He smiled politely and said , " I 'd better just check your Klamotte , sir . " The station was crowded with people . Faber thought that if he could get into the crowd he might escape . He dropped the suitcase radio and fled , pushing his way through the crowd . Suddenly he realized he had left his trousers on the train , and there were swastikas on his socks . He would have122 Ken Follett EYE OF THE NEEDLE 123to buy trousers at the very first shop , before people noticed the trouserless running man with Nazi hose . Then someone in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " and tripped him , and he fell with a bump and landed on the floor of the railway carriage where he had gone to sleep . He blinked , yawned and looked around him . He had a headache . For a moment he was filled with relief that it was all a dream , then he was amused by the ridiculousness of the symbolism  --  swastika socks , for God 's sake ! A man in overalls beside him said , " You had a good sleep . " Faber looked up sharply . He was always afraid of talking in his sleep and giving himself away . " I had an unpleasant dream , " he said . The man made no comment . It was getting dark . He had slept for a long time . The carriage light came on suddenly , a single blue bulb , and someone drew the blinds . People 's faces turned into pale , featureless ovals . The workman became talkative again . " You missed the excitement , " he told Faber . Faber frowned . " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through some kind of police check . " One of them Yank trains passed us . It was going about ten miles an hour , nigger driving it , ringing its bell , with a bloody great cowcatcher on the front ! Talk about the Wild West . " Faber smiled and thought back to the dream . In fact his arrival in London had been without incident . He had checked into a hotel at first , still using his Belgian cover . Within a week he had visited several country churchyards , taken the names of men his age from the gravestones , and applied for three duplicate birth certificates . Then he took lodgings and found humble work , using forged references from a nonexistent Manchester firm . He had even got on to the electoral register in Highgate before the war . He voted Conservative . When rationing came in , the ration books were issued via householders to every person who had slept in the house on a particular night . Faber contrived to spend part of that night in each of three different houses , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He burned the Belgian passport  --  in the unlikely event he should need a passport , he could get three British ones . The train stopped , and from the noise outside the passengersguessed they had arrived . When Faber got out he realized how hungry and thirsty he was . His last meal had been sausage-meat , dry biscuits and bottled water , twenty-four hours ago . He went through the ticket barrier and found the station buffet . It was full of people , mostly soldiers , sleeping or trying to sleep at the tables . Faber asked for a cheese sandwich and a cup of tea . " The food is reserved for servicemen , " said the woman behind the counter . " Just the tea , then . " " Got a cup ? " Faber was surprised . " No , I have n't . " " Neither have we , chum . " Faber contemplated going into the Great Eastern Hotel for dinner , but that would take time . He found a pub and drank two pints of weak beer , then bought a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the newspaper wrapping , standing on the pavement . They made him feel surprisingly full . Now he had to find a chemist 's shop and break in . He wanted to develop his film , to make sure the pictures came out . He was not going to risk returning to Germany with a roll of spoiled , useless film . If the pictures were no good he would have to steal more film and go back . The thought was unbearable . It would have to be a small independent shop , not a branch of a chain that would process film centrally . It must be in an area where the local people could afford cameras ( or could have afforded them before the war ) . The part of East London in which Liverpool Street station stood was no good . He decided to head toward Bloomsbury . The moonlit streets were quiet . There had been no sirens so far tonight . Two Military Policemen stopped him in Chancery Lane and asked for his identity card . Faber pretended to be slightly drunk , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doors . He found the shop he was looking for at the north end of124 Ken Follett EYE OF THE NEEDLE 125Southampton Row . There was a Kodak sign in the window . Surprisingly , the shop was open . He went in . A stooped , irritable man with thinning hair and glasses stood behind the counter , wearing a white coat . He said , " We 're only open for doctor 's prescriptions . " " That 's all right . I just want to ask whether you developphotographs . " " Yes , if you come back tomorrow  --  " " Do you do them on the premises ? " Faber asked . " I need them quickly , you see . " " Yes , if you come back tomorrow  --  " " Could I have the prints the same day ? My brother 's on leave , and he wants to take some back  --  " " Twenty-four hours is the best we can do . Come back tomorrow . " " Thank you , I will . " On his way out he noticed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He crossed the road and stood in the shadows , waiting . Promptly at nine o'clock the pharmacist came out , lockingthe shop behind him , and walked off down the road . Faber went in the opposite direction and turned two corners . There seemed to be no direct access to the back of the shop , and Faber did not want to break in the front way in case the unlocked door was noticed by a patrolling policemanwhile he was in there . He walked along the parallel street , looking for a way through . Apparently there was none . Still , there had to be a well of some kind at the back , the two streets were too far apart for the buildings to be joined back-to-back . Finally he came across a large old house with a nameplatemarking it as a residence hall for a nearby college . The front door was unlocked . Faber went in and walked quickly through to a communal kitchen . A lone girl sat at a table , drinking coffee and reading a book . Faber muttered , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her text . Faber went out of the back door . He crossed a yard , bumping into a cluster of garbage cans on the way , and found a door to a lane . In seconds he was at the rear of the chemist 's shop . This entrance was obviously never used . He clambered over some tires and adiscarded mattress , and threw his shoulder at the door . The rotten wood gave easily , and Faber was inside . He found the darkroom and shut himself in . The light switch operated a dim red lamp in the ceiling . The place was quite well equipped , with neatly labeled bottles of developingfluid , an enlarger , and even a dryer for prints . Faber worked quickly but carefully , getting the temperatureof the tanks exactly right , agitating the fluids to develop the film evenly , timing the processes by the hands of a large electric clock on the wall . The negatives were perfect . He let them dry , then fed them through the enlarger and made one complete set of ten-by-eight prints @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the images gradually appear in the bath of developer  --  damn , he had done a good job ! There was now a major decision to be made . The problem had been in his mind all day , and now that the pictures had come out he was forced to confront it . What if he did not make it home ? The journey ahead of him was , to say the least , hazardous . He was more than confident of his own ability to make the rendezvous in spite of travel restrictions and coastal security ; but he could not guarantee that the U-boat would be there ; or that it would get back across the North Sea . And , of course , he might walk out of here and get run over by a bus . The possibility that , having discovered the most importantsecret of the war , he might die and his secret die with him , was too awful to think about . He had to have a fall-back stratagem ; a second method of trying to ensure that the evidence of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no postal service between England and Germany . Mail had to go via a neutral country . And all such mail was sure to be censored . He could write in code , but there was no point ; he had to send the pictures  --  they were the evidence that counted . There was a route , and a good one , he 'd been told . At the Portuguese Embassy in London there was an official , sympathetic to Germany  --  partly for political reasons and partly , Faber worried , because he was well bribed  --  who126 Ken Follettwould pass messages via the diplomatic bag to the German Embassy in neutral Lisbon . From there , it was safe . The route had been opened early in 1939 , but Faber had used it only once before , when Canaris had asked for a routine test communication . It would do . It would have to do . Faber felt angry . He hated to place his faith in others . They were all such bumbling  --  still , he could n't take the chance . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a lesser risk than using the radio  --  and certainly less than the risk if Germany never learned at all . Faber 's mind was clear . The balance of argument indisputablyfavored the Portuguese Embassy contact . He sat down to write a letter . Frederick Bloggs had spent an unpleasant afternoon in the countryside . When five worried wives had contacted their local police station to say their husbands had not come home , a rural police-constable had exercised his limited powers of deductionand concluded that a whole patrol of the Home Guard had not gone AWOL . He was fairly sure they had simply got lost  --  they were all a bit daft , otherwise they would have been in the Army  --  but all the same he notified his constabulary headquarters just to cover himself . The operations-roomsergeant who took the message realized at once that the missing men had been patrolling a particularly sensitivemilitary area , and he notified his inspector , who notifiedScotland Yard , who sent a Special Branch man down there and notified MI5 , which sent Bloggs . The Special Branch man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He and Bloggs met on the train , which was one of the Wild West locomotives lent to Britain by the Americans because of the shortage of trains . Harris repeated his invitation to Sunday dinner , and Bloggs told him again that he worked most Sundays . When they got off the train they borrowed bicycles to ride along the canal towpath until they met up with the search party . Harris , ten years older than Bloggs and fiftyfivepounds heavier , found the ride a strain . They met a section of the search party under a railway bridge . Harris welcomed the opportunity to get off the bicycle . " What have you found ? " he said . " Bodies ? " " No , a boat , " said a policeman . " Who are you ? " They introduced themselves . A constable stripped to his128 Ken Follett EYE OF THE NEEDLE 129underwear was diving down to examine the vessel . He came up with a bung in his hand . Bloggs looked at Harris . " Deliberately scuttled ? " " Looks like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Notice any- thing else ? " " She has n't been down there for long , she 's in good con- dition , and the mast has been taken down , not broken . " Harris said , " That 's a lot of information from a minute under water . " " I 'm a weekend sailor , " the diver said . Harris and Bloggs mounted their cycles and moved on . When they met up with the main party , the bodies had been found . " Murdered , all five , " said the uniformed inspector in charge . " Captain Langham , Corporal Lee , and Privates Watson , Dayton and Forbes . Dayton 's neck was broken , the rest were killed with some kind of a knife . Langham 's body had been in the canal . All found together in a shallow grave . Bloody murder . " He was quite shaken . Harris looked closely at the five bodies , laid out in a line . " I 've seen wounds like this before , Fred , " he said . Bloggs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  " Harris nodded . " Stiletto . " The inspector said in astonishment , " You know who did it ? " " We can guess , " Harris said . " We think he 's killed twice before . If it 's the same man , we know who he is but not where he is . " " What with the restricted area so close , " the inspector said , " and Special Branch and MI5 arriving on the scene so quick , is there anything else I need to know about this case ? " Harris answered , " Just that you keep very quiet until your chief constable has talked to our people . " " Found anything else , inspector ? " Bloggs asked . " We 're still going over the area , and in ever-widening circles ; but nothing so far . There were some clothes in the grave . " He pointed . Bloggs touched them gingerly ; black trousers , a black sweater , a short black leather jacket , RAF-style . " Clothes for night work , " Harris @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bloggs added . " How tall is your man ? " " Over six foot . " The inspector said , " Did you pass the men who found the sunken boat ? " " Yes . " Bloggs frowned . " Where 's the nearest lock ? " " Four miles upstream . " " If our man was in a boat , the lock-keeper must have seen him , must n't he ? " " Must have , " the inspector agreed . Bloggs said , " We 'd better talk to him . " He returned to his bicycle . " Not another four miles , " Harris complained . " Work off some of those Sunday dinners , " Bloggs told him . The four-mile ride took them most of an hour  --  the towpathwas made for horses , not wheels , and it was uneven , muddy and mined with loose boulders and tree roots . Harriswas sweating and cursing by the time they reached the lock . The lock-keeper was sitting outside his little house , smoking a pipe and enjoying the mild air of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and slower movements . He regarded the two cyclists with some amusement . Bloggs spoke , because Harris was out of breath . " We 're police officers , " he said . " Is that so ? " said the lock-keeper . " What 's the excitement ? " He looked as excited as a cat in front of a fire . Bloggs took the photograph of Die Nadel out of his walletand gave it to the man . " Have you ever seen him ? " The lock-keeper put the picture on his lap while he held a fresh match to his pipe . Then he studied the photograph for a while , and handed it back . " Well ? " Harris said . " Aye . He was here about this time yesterday . Came in for a cup of tea . Nice enough chap . What 's he done , shown a light after blackout ? " Bloggs sat down heavily . " That clinches it , " he said . Harris thought aloud . " He moors the boat downstream from here and goes into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so that the lock-keeper would not hear. 130 Ken Follett " When he comes back , the Home Guard has his boat staked out . He deals with them , sails a bit farther to the railway , scuttles his boat and ... hops a train ? " Bloggs said to the lock-keeper : " The railway line that crosses the canal a few miles downstream  --  where does it go ? " " London . " Bloggs said , " Oh , shit . " Bloggs got back to the War Office in Whitehall at mid- night . Godliman and Billy Parkin were there waiting for him . Bloggs said , " It 's him , all right , " and told them the story . Parkin was excited , Godliman just looked tense . When Bloggs had finished , Godliman said : " So now he 's back in London , and we 're looking for , in more ways than one , a needle in a haystack again . " He was playing with matches , forming a picture with them on his desk . " Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I get the feeling I 've actually met the damn fellow . " " Well , think , for God 's sake , " Bloggs said . " Where ? " Godliman shook his head in frustration . " It must have been only once , and somewhere strange . It 's like a face I 've seen in a lecture audience , or in the background at a cock- tail party . A fleeting glimpse , a casual encounter  --  when I remember it probably wo n't do us any good . " Parkin said , " What 's in that area ? " " I do n't know , which means it 's probably highly impor- tant , " Godliman said . There was a silence . Parkin lit a cigarette with one of Godliman 's matches . Bloggs looked up . " We could print a million copies of his picture  --  give one to every policeman , ARP warden , member of the Home Guard , serviceman , railway porter ; paste them up on boardings and publish them in the papers ... " Godliman shook his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ al- ready talked to Hamburg about whatever he 's seen ? If we make a public fuss about the man they 'll know that his information is good .

We 'll give his description to the press and say he 's just a conventional murderer . We can give the details of the Highgate and Stockwell murders , without saying that security is involved . " Parkin said , " What you 're saying is , we have to fight with one hand tied behind our back . " " For now anyway . " " I 'll start the ball rolling with the Yard , " Bloggs said . He picked up the phone . Godliman looked at his watch . " There 's not much more we can do tonight , but I do n't feel like going home . I sha n't sleep . " Parkin stood up . " In that case , I 'm going to find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out . The matches on Godliman 's desk made a picture of a horse and carriage . He took away one of the horse 's legs and lit his pipe with it . " Have you got a girl , Fred ? " he asked conversationally . " No . " " Not since  --  ? " " No . " Godliman puffed at his pipe . " There has to be an end to bereavement , you know . " Bloggs made no reply . Godliman said , " Look , perhaps I should n't talk to you like a Dutch uncle . But I know how you feel  --  I 've been through it myself . The only difference was that I did n't have anyone to blame . " " You did n't remarry , " Bloggs said , not looking at Godliman . " No , and I do n't want you to make the same mistake . When you reach middle age , living alone can be very depressing . " " Did I ever tell you , they called her Fearless Bloggs . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Godliman . " Tell me , where in the world will I find another girl like that ? " " Does she have to be a hero ? " " After Christine ... " " England is full of heroes , Fred  --  " I I ! Ken Follett EYE OF THE NEEDLE 133At that moment Colonel Terry walked in . " Do n't get up , gentlemen . This is important , listen carefully . Whoever killed those five Home Guards has learned a vital secret . There 's an invasion coming . You know that . You do n't know when or where . Needless to say , our objective is to keep the Germans in that same state of ignorance . Most of all , about where the invasion will come . We have gone to some extreme lengths to ensure that the enemy be misled in this matter . Now , it seems certain , he will not be if their man gets through . He has , it is definitely established , found out our deception . Unless we stop him from delivering his news , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say , the war  --  is compromised . I 've already told you more than I wanted to , but it 's imperative that you understand the urgency and precise consequences of failure to stop the intelligence from getting through . " He did not tell them that Normandy was the invasion site , nor that the Pas de Calais via East Anglia the diversionary one  --  though he realizedGodliman would surely conclude the latter once he had debriefed Bloggs on his efforts to trail the murderer of the Home Guardsmen . Bloggs said : " Excuse me , but why are you so sure their man found out ? " Terry went to the door . " Come in , Rodriguez . " A tall , handsome man with jet-black hair and a long nose entered the room and nodded politely to Godliman and Bloggs . Terry said : " Senhor Rodriguez is our man at the Portuguese Embassy . Tell them what happened , Rodriguez . " The man stood by the door . " As you know , we have been watching Senhor Francisco of the embassy staff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man in a taxi , and received an envelope . We relieved him of the envelope shortly after the man in the taxi drove off . We were able to get the license number of the taxi . " " I 'm having the cabbie traced , " Terry said . " All right , Rodriguez , you 'd better get back . And thank you . " The tall Portuguese left the room . Terry handed to Godlimana large yellow envelope , addressed to Manuel Francisco . Godliman opened it  --  it had already been unsealedand withdrew a second envelope marked with a meaninglessseries of letters : presumably a code . Within the inner envelope were several sheets of paper covered with handwriting and a set of ten-by-eight photographs . Godliman examined the letter . " It looks like a very basic code , " he said . " You do n't need to read it , " Terry said impatiently . " Look at the photographs . " Godliman did so . There were about thirty of them , and he looked at each one before speaking . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Bloggs glanced through the pictures , then put them down . Godliman said , " This is only his backup . He 's still gotthe negatives , and he 's going somewhere with them . " The three men sat still in the little office , like a tableau . The only illumination came from a spotlight on Godliman 's desk . With the cream walls , the blacked-out window , the spare furniture and the worn Civil Service carpet , it was a prosaic backdrop for dramatics . Terry said , " I 'm going to have to tell Churchill . " The phone rang , and the colonel picked it up . " Yes . Good . Bring him here right away , please  --  but before you do , ask him where he dropped the passenger . What ? Thank you , get here fast . " He hung up . " The taxi dropped our man at University College Hospital . " Bloggs said , " Perhaps he was injured in the fight with the Home Guard . " Terry said , " Where is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Euston Station , " Godlimansaid . " Trains from Euston go to Holyhead , Liverpool , Glasgow ... all places from which you can catch a ferry to Ireland . " " Liverpool to Belfast , " Bloggs said . " Then a car to the border across into Eire , and a U-boat on the Atlantic coast . Somewhere . He would n't risk Holyhead-to-Dublin because of the passport control , and there would be no point in going beyond Liverpool to Glasgow . " Godliman said , " Fred , you 'd better go to the station and show the picture of Faber around , see if anyone noticed him getting on a train . I 'll phone the station and warn them134 Ken Follett EYE OF THE NEEDLE 135you 're coming , and at the same time find out which trains have left since about ten thirty . " Bloggs picked up his hat and coat . " I 'm on my way . " Godliman lifted the phone . " Yes , we 're on our way . " There were still plenty of people at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closed around midnight , wartime delays were such that the last train often had not left before the earliest milk train of the morning arrived . The station concourse was a mass of kitbags and sleeping bodies . Bloggs showed the picture to three railway policemen . None of them recognized the face . He tried ten women por- ters : nothing . He went to every ticket barrier . One of the guards said , " We look at tickets , not faces . " He tried half a dozen passengers without result . Finally he went into the ticket office and showed the picture to each of the clerks . A very fat , bald clerk with ill-fitting false teeth recog- nized the face . " I play a game , " he told Bloggs . " I try to spot something about a passenger that tells me why he 's catching a train . Like , he might have a black tie for a fu- neral , or muddy boots means he 's a farmer going home , or there might be a college scarf , or a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's took off her wedding ring ... know what I mean ? Everybody 's got something . This is a dull job  --  not that I 'm complaining  --  " " What did you notice about this fellow ? " Bloggs inter- rupted him . " Nothing . That was it , see  --  I could n't make him out at all . Almost like he was trying to be inconspicuous , know what I mean ? " " I know what you mean . " Bloggs paused . " Now , I want you to think very carefully . Where was he going  --  can you remember ? " " Yes , " said the fat clerk . " Inverness . " " That does n't mean he 's going there , " said Godliman . " He 's a professional  --  he knows we can ask questions at railway stations . I expect he automatically buys a ticket for the wrong destination . " He looked at his watch . " He must have caught the 11:45 . That train is now pulling intoStafford . I checked with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to stop the train this side o , Crewe .

You 'll be dressed as a ticket inspector , and you'l look at every ticket  --  and every face  --  on that train . Wher you 've spotted Faber , just stay close to him . " Bloggs , you 'll be waiting at the ticket barrier at Crewe just in case Faber decides to hop off there . But he wo n't You 'll get on the train , and be first off at Liverpool , and wait ing at the ticket barrier for Parkin and Faber to come off Half the local constabulary will be there to back you up .

" Godliman opened a desk drawer , took out a pistol , anc gave it to Parkin . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Parkin pocketed the weapon without comment . Godliman said : " You heard Colonel Terry , but I want to emphasize the importance of all this . If we do n't catch thi : man , the invasion of Europe will have to be postponedpossiblyfor a year . In that year the balance of war could turn against us . The time may never be this right again . " Bloggs said : " Do we get told how long it is to D-Day ? ' Godliman decided they were at least as entitled as he . . they were going into the field , after all . " All I know is tha it 's probably a matter of weeks . " Parkin was thinking . " It 'll be June , then . " The phone rang and Godliman picked it up . After a mo ment he looked up . " Your car 's here . " Bloggs and Parkin stood up . Godliman said , " Wait a minute . " They stood by the door , looking at the professor . He wa , saying , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Good-bye , sir . " Bloggs could not think of anyone Godliman called Sir He said : " Who was that ?

" EYE OF THE NEEDLE 13715 The carriage was pitch dark . Faber thought of the jokes people made , " Take your hand off my knee . No , not you , you . " The British would make jokes out of anything . Their railways were now worse than ever , but nobody complained any more because it was in a good cause . Faber preferred the dark ; it was anonymous . There had been singing , earlier on . Three soldiers in the corridor had started it , and the whole carriage had joined in . They had been through " Be Like the Kettle and Sing , " " There 'll Always Be an England " ( followed by " Glasgow Belongs to Me " and " Land of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , appropriately , " Do n't Get Around Much Any More . " There had been an air raid warning , and the train slowed to thirty miles an hour . They were all supposed to lie on the floor , but of course there was no room . An anonymous female voice had said , " Oh , God , I 'm frightened , " and a male voice , equally anonymous except that it was cockney , had said : " You 're in the safest glace , girl  --  they ca n't ' it a movin ' target . " Then everyone laughed and nobody was scared any more . Someone opened a suitcase and passed around a packet of dried-egg sandwiches . One of the sailors wanted to play cards . " How can we play cards in the dark ? " " Feel the edges . All Harry 's cards are marked . " The train stopped unaccountably at about 4 A.M. A cut- tured voice  --  the dried-egg-sandwich supplier , Faber thought  --  said , " My guess is we 're outside Crewe . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bol- ton to Bournemouth , " said the cockney . The train jerked and moved off , and everyone cheered . Where , Faber wondered , was the caricature Englishmai with his icy reserve and his stiff upper lip ? Not here . A few minutes later a voice in the corridor said : " Ticket please . " Faber noted the Yorkshire accent ; they were ii the north now . He fumbled in his pockets for his ticket . He had the corner seat , near the door , so he could see into the corridor . The inspector was shining a flashligh onto the tickets . Faber saw the man 's silhouette in the re flected light . It looked vaguely familiar . He settled back in his seat to wait . He remembered th , nightmare : " This is an Abwehr ticket "  --  and smiled in thi dark . Then he frowned . The train stopped unaccountably shortly afterward a ticket inspector began ; the inspector ' face was vaguely familiar ... It might be nothing , but Fabe stayed alive by worrying about things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the man had entere4 a compartment . The train stopped briefly  --  the station was Crewe , ac cording to informed opinion in Faber 's compartment  --  am moved off again . Faber got another look at the inspector 's face , and nos he remembered . The boarding house in Highgate ! The bo , from Yorkshire who wanted to get into the Army ! Faber watched him carefully . His flashlight moved acros the face of every passenger . He was not just looking a the tickets . No , Faber told himself , do n't jump to conclusions . Hos could they possibly have got on to him ? They could no have found out which train he was on , got hold of one o the few people in the world who knew what he looked like and got the man on the train dressed as a ticket inspecto in so short a time .. . Parkin , that was his name . Billy Parkin . Somehow h. looked much older now . He was coming closer . It must be a look-alike  --  perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Parkin entered the compartment next to Faber 's . Then was no time left . Faber assumed the worst , and prepared to deal with it . He got up , left the compartment , and went along the138 Ken Follett corridor , picking his way over suitcases and kitbags and bodies , to the lavatory . It was vacant . He went in and locked the door . He was only buying time  --  even ticket inspectors did not fail to check the toilets . He sat on the seat and wondered how to get out of this . The train had speeded up and was traveling too fast for him to jump off . Besides , someone would see him go , and if they were really searching for him they would stop the train . " All tickets , please . " Parkin was getting close again . Faber had an idea . The coupling between the carriages was a tiny space like an air-lock , enclosed by a bellowslike cover between the cars of the train , shut off at both ends by doors because of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , fought his way to the end of the carriage , opened the door , and stepped into the connecting passage . He closed the door behind him . It was freezing cold , and the noise was terrific . Faber sat on the floor and curled up , pretending to sleep . Only a dead man could sleep here , but people did strange things on trains these days . He tried not to shiver . The door opened behind him . " Tickets , please . " He ignored it . He heard the door close . " Wake up , Sleeping Beauty . " The voice was unmis- takable . Faber pretended to stir , then got to his feet , keeping his back to Parkin . When he turned the stiletto was in his hand . He pushed Parkin up against the door , held the point of the knife at his throat , and said , " Be still or I 'll kill you . " With his left hand he took Parkin 's flashlight , and shone it into the young man 's face . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be . Faber said , " Well , well , Billy Parkin , who wanted to join the Army , and ended up on the railways . Still , it 's a uniform . " Parkin said , " You . " " You know damn well it 's me , little Billy Parkin . You were looking for me . Why ? " He was doing his best to sound vicious . " I do n't know why I should be looking for you  --  I 'm not a policeman . " Faber jerked the knife melodramatically . " Stop lying to me . " " Honest , Mr. Faber . Let me go  --  I promise I wo n't tell anyone I 've seen you . " Faber began to have doubts . Either Parkin was telling the truth , or he was overacting as much as Faber himself . Parkin 's body shifted , his right arm moving in the darkness . Faber grabbed the wrist in an iron grip . Parkin struggledfor an instant , but Faber let the needle point of the stiletto sink a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the man was still . Faber found the pocket Parkin had been reaching for , and pulled out a gun . " Ticket inspectors do not go armed , " he said . " Who are you with , Parkin ? " " We all carry guns now  --  there 's a lot of crime on trains because of the dark . " Parkin was at least lying courageously and creatively . Faber decided that threats were not going to be enough to loosen his tongue . His movement was sudden , swift and accurate . The blade of the stiletto leaped in his fist . Its point entered a measuredhalf inch into Parkin 's left eye and came out again . Faber 's hand covered Parkin 's mouth . The muffled scream of agony was drowned by the noise of the train . Parkin 's hands went to his ruined eye . " Save yourself the other eye , Parkin . Who are you with ? " " Military Intelligence , oh God , please do n't do it again . " " Who ? Menzies ? Masterman ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Godliman ! " Faber knew the name , but this was no time to search his memory for details . " What have they got ? " " A picture  --  I picked you out from the files . " " What picture ? What picture ? " " A racing team  --  running  --  with a cup  --  the Army  --  " Faber remembered . Christ , where had they got hold of that ? It was his nightmare : they had a picture . People would know his face . His face. 140 Ken Follett EYE OF THE NEEDLE 141He moved the knife closer to Parkin 's right eye . " How did you know where I was ? " " Do n't do it , please ... the embassy ... took your letter ... the cab ... Euston  --  please , not the other eye .... " He covered both his eyes with his hands . Goddam . That idiot Francisco .... Now he  --  " What 's the plan ? Where is the trap ? " " Glasgow . They 're waiting for you at Glasgow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lowered the knife to the level of Parkin 's belly . To distract him , he said , " How many men ? " Then he pushed hard , inward and upward to the heart . Parkin 's one eye stared in horror , and he did not die . It was the drawback to Faber 's favored method of killing . Normally the shock of the knife was enough to stop the heart . But if the heart was strong it did not always work  --  after all , surgeons sometimes stuck a hypodermic needle directly into the heart to inject adrenalin . If the heart continued to pump , the motion would work a hole around the blade , from which the blood would leak . It was just as fatal , but longer . At last Parkin 's body went limp . Faber held him against the wall for a moment , thinking . There had been something  --  aflicker of courage , the ghost of a smile  --  before the man died . It meant something . Such things always did . He let the body fall to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with the wounds hidden from view . He kicked the railway cap into a corner . He cleaned his stiletto on Parkin 's trousers , and wiped the ocular liquid from his hands . It had been a messy business . He put the knife away in his sleeve and opened the door to the car . He made his way back to his compartment in the dark . As he sat down the cockney said , " You took your time  --  is there a queue ? " Faber said , " It must have been something I ate . " " Probably a dried-egg sandwich . " The cockney laughed . Faber was thinking about Godliman . He knew the name  --  he could even put a vague face to it : a middle-aged , bespectacled face , with a pipe and an absent , professorial air ... that was it  --  he was a professor . It was coming back . In his first couple of years in London Faber had had little Faber was not among the optimists . ) He had been able to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Abwehr 's out-of-date maps , plus general reports based on his own observations and his reading of the newspapers  --  but not much . To fill in time , to improve his English , and to flesh out his cover , he had gone sightseeing . His purpose in visiting Canterbury Cathedral had been innocent , although he did buy an aerial view of the town and the cathedral that he sent back for the Luftwaffe  --  not that it did much good ; they spent most of 1942 missing it . Faber had taken a whole day to see the building : reading the ancient initials carved in walls , distinguishing the differentarchitectural styles , reading the guidebook line by line as he walked slowly around . He had been in the south ambulatory of the choir , looking at the blind arcading , when he became conscious of another absorbed figure by his side  --  an older man . " Fascinating , is n't it ? " the man said , and Faber asked him what he meant . " The one pointed arch in an arcade of round ones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't been rebuilt . For some reason , somebody just altered that one . I wonder why . " Faber saw what he meant . The choir was Romanesque , the nave Gothic ; yet here in the choir was a solitary Gothic arch . " Perhaps , " he said , " the monks demanded to see what the pointed arches would look like , and the architect did this to show them . " The older man stared at him . " What a splendid conjecture ! Of course that 's the reason . Are you an historian ? " Faber laughed . " No , just a clerk and an occasional reader of history books . " " People get doctorates for inspired guesses like that ! " " Are you ? An historian , I mean ? " " Yes , for my sins . " He stuck out his hand . " Percy Godliman . " Was it possible , Faber thought as the train rattled on through Lancashire , that that unimpressive figure in a142 Ken Follett EYE OF THE NEEDLE 143tweed suit could be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were civil servants or something equally vague ; not historians  --  that lie could be too easily found out . Yet it was rumored that Military Intelligencehad been bolstered by a number of academics . Faber had imagined them to be young , fit , aggressive and bellicose as well as clever . Godliman was clever , but none of the rest . Unless he had changed . Faber had seen him once again , although he had not spoken to him on the second occasion . After the brief encounterin the cathedral Faber had seen a notice advertising a public lecture on Henry II to be given by Professor Godlimanat his college . He had gone along , out of curiosity . The talk had been erudite , lively and convincing . Godliman was still a faintly comic figure , prancing about behind the lectern , getting enthusiastic about his subject ; but it was clear his mind was as sharp as a knife . So that was the man who had discovered what Die Nadel looked like . An amateur . Well , he would make amateur mistakes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recognized the boy . Godlimanshould have sent someone Faber did not know . Parkin had a better chance of recognizing Faber , but no chance at all of surviving the encounter . A professional would have known that . The train shuddered to a halt , and a muffled voice outsideannounced that this was Liverpool . Faber cursed under his breath ; he should have been spending the time working out his next move , not remembering Percival Godliman . They were waiting at Glasgow , Parkin had said before he died . Why Glasgow ? Their inquiries at Euston would have told them he was going to Inverness . And if they suspected Inverness to be a red herring , they would have speculated that he was coming here , to Liverpool  --  this was the nearest link point for an Irish ferry . Faber hated snap decisions . Whichever , he had to get off the train . He stood up , opened the door , stepped out , and headed for the ticket barrier . He thought of something else . What was it that hadflashed in Billy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not fear , not pain  --  although all those had been present . It was more like ... triumph ? Faber looked up , past the ticket collector , and understood . Waiting on the other side , dressed in a hat and raincoat , was the blond young tail from Leicester Square . Parkin , dying in agony and humiliation , had deceived Faber at the last . The trap was here . The man in the raincoat had not yet noticed Faber in the crowd . Faber turned and stepped back on to the train . Once inside , he pulled aside the blind and looked out . The tail was searching the faces in the crowd . He had not noticedthe man who got back on the train . Faber watched while the passengers filtered through the gate until the platform was empty . The blond man spoke urgently to the ticket collector , who shook his head . The man seemed to insist . After a moment he waved to someoneout of sight . A police officer emerged from the shadows and spoke to the collector . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man in a civilian suit who was presumablya more senior railway official . The engine driver and his fireman left the locomotive and went over to the barrier . There was more waving of arms and shaking of heads . Finally the railwaymen shrugged , turned away , or rolled their eyes upward , all telegraphing surrender . The blond and the police officer summoned other policemen , and they moved on to the platform . They were obviously going to search the train . All the railway officials , including the engine crew , had disappeared in the opposite direction , no doubt to seek out tea and sandwiches while the lunatic tried to search a jampackedtrain . Which gave Faber an idea . He opened the door and jumped out of the wrong side of the train , the side opposite the platform . Concealed from the police by the cars , he ran along the tracks , stumbling on the ties and slipping on the gravel , toward the engine . It had to be bad news , of course . From the moment he realized Billy Parkin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 44 Ken Follett EYE OF THE NEEDLE 145 Frederick Bloggs knew that Die Nadel had slipped through their fingers again . As the uniformed police moved onto the train in pairs , two men to search each car , Bloggs thought of several possible explanations of Parkin 's nonap- pearance ; and all the explanations were depressing . He turned up his coat collar and paced the drafty plat- form . He wanted very badly to catch Die Nadel ; and not only for the sake of the invasion  --  although that was reason enough , of course  --  but for Percy Godliman , and for the five Home Guards , and for Christine , and for himself . . . . He looked at his watch : four o'clock . Soon it would be day . Bloggs had been up all night , and he had not eaten since breakfast yesterday , but until now he had kept going on adrenalin . The failure of the trap  --  he was quite sure it had failed  --  drained him of energy . Hunger and fatigue caught up with him . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hot food and a warm bed . " Sir ! " A policeman was leaning out of a car and waving at him . " Sir ! " Bloggs walked toward him , then broke into a run . " What is it ? " " It might be your man Parkin . " Bloggs climbed into the car . " What the hell do you mean , might be ? " " You 'd better have a look . " The policeman opened the communicating door between the cars and shone his flash- light inside . It was Parkin ; Bloggs could tell by the ticket inspector 's uniform . He was curled up on the floor . Bloggs took the policeman 's light , knelt down beside Parkin , and turned him over . He saw Parkin 's face , looked quickly away . " Oh , dear God . " " I take it this is Parkin ? " the policeman said . Bloggs nodded . He got up , very slowly , without looking again at the body . " We 'll interview everybody in this car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who saw or heard any- thing unusual will be detained for further questioning . Not that it will do us any good ; the murderer must have jumped off the train before it got here . " Bloggs went back out on the platform . All the searchers had completed their tasks and were gathered in a group . He detailed six of them to help with the interviewing . The police-inspector said , " Your man 's hopped it , then . " " Almost certainly . You 've looked in every toilet , and the guard 's van ? " " Yes , and on top of the train and under it , and in the engine and the coal tender . " A passenger got off the train and approached Bloggs and the inspector . He was a small man who wheezed badly . " Excuse me , " he said . " Yes , sir , " the inspector said . " I was wondering , are you looking for somebody ? " " Why do you ask ? " " Well , if you are , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Why do you ask ? " Bloggs interrupted impatiently . " Yes , a tall man . Come on , spit it out . " " Well , it 's just that a tall chap got out the wrong side of the train . " " When ? " " A minute or two after the train pulled into the station . He got on , like , then he got off , on the wrong side . Jumped down onto the track . Only he had no , luggage , you see , which was another odd thing , and I just thought  --  " The inspector said , " Balls . " " He must have spotted the trap , " Bloggs said . " But how ? He does n't know my face , and your men were out of sight . " " Something made him suspicious . " " So he crossed the line to the next platform and went out that way . Would n't he have been seen ? " The inspector shrugged . " Not too many people about this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say he was too impatient to queue at the ticket barrier . " " Did n't you have the other ticket barriers covered ? " " Afraid I did n't think of it . . . well , we can search the surrounding area , and later on we can check various places in the city , and of course we 'll watch the ferry  --  " " Yes , please do , " Bloggs said . But somehow he knew Faber would not be found . It was more than an hour before the train started to146 Ken Follett EYE OF THE NEEDLE 147move . Faber had a cramp in his left calf and dust in his nose . He heard the engineer and fireman climb back into their cab , and caught snatches of conversation about a body being found on the train . There was a metallic rattle as the fireman shoveled coal , then the hiss of steam , a clanking of pistons , a jerk and a sigh of smoke as the train moved off . Gratefully , Faber shifted his position and indulged in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the back of the coal tender , buried deep in the coal , where it would take a man with a shovel ten minutes ' hard work to expose him . As he had hoped , the police search of the tender had consisted of one good long look and no more . He wondered whether he could risk emerging now . It must be getting light ; would he be visible from a bridge over the line ? He thought not . His skin was now quite black , and in a moving train in the pale light of dawn he would just be a dark blur on a dark background . Yes , he would chance it . Slowly and carefully , he dug his way out of his grave of coal . He breathed deeply of the cool air . The coal was shoveledout of the tender via a small hole in the front end . Later , perhaps , the fireman would have to enter the tender when the pile of fuel got lower . But he was safe for now . As the light strengthened he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toe in coal dust , like a miner coming up from the pit . Somehow he had to wash and change his clothes . He chanced a look over the side of the tender . The train was still in the suburbs , passing factories and warehouses and rows of grimy little houses . He had to think about his next move . His original plan had been to get off the train at Glasgow and there catch another train to Dundee and up the east coast to Aberdeen . It was still possible for him to disembarkat Glasgow . He could not get off at the station , of course , but he might jump off either just before or just after . However , there were risks in that . The train was sure to stop at intermediate stations between Liverpool and Glasgow , and at those stops he might be spotted . No , he had to get off the train soon and find another means of transport . The ideal place would be a lonely stretch of track just outside a city or village . It had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the coal tender  --  but it had to be fairly near houses so that he could steal clothes and a car . And it needed to be an uphill grade of track so that the train would be traveling slowly enough for him to jump . Right now its speed was about forty miles an hour . Faber lay back on the coal to wait . He could not keep a permanentwatch on the country through which he was passing , for fear of being seen . He decided he would look out wheneverthe train slowed down . Otherwise he would lie still . After a few minutes he caught himself dropping off to sleep , despite the discomfort of his position . He shifted and reclined on his elbows so that if he did sleep he would fall and be wakened by the impact . The train was gathering speed . Between London and Liverpoolit had seemed to be stationary more than moving ; now it steamed through the country at a fine pace . To complete his discomfort , it started to rain : a cold , steady drizzle that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ice on his skin . Another reason for getting off the train ; he could die of exposure before they reached Glasgow . After half an hour at high speed he was contemplating killing the engine crew and stopping the train himself . A signal box saved their lives . The train slowed suddenly as brakes were applied . It decelerated in stages ; Faber guessed the track was marked with descending speed limits . He looked out . They were in the countryside again . He could see the reason for the slowdown  --  they were approaching a track junction , and the signals were against them . Faber stayed in the tender while the train stood still . After five minutes it started up again . Faber scrambled up the side of the tender , perched on the edge for a moment , and jumped . He landed on the embankment and lay , face down , in the overgrown weeds . When the train was out of earshot he got to his feet . The only sign of civilization nearby was the signal box , a two-story wooden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , an outside staircase148 Ken Follettand a door at ground-floor level . On the far side was a cinder track leading away . Faber walked in a wide circle to approach the place from the back , where there were no windows . He entered a ground-floor door and found what he had been expecting : a toilet , a washbasin , and , as a bonus , a coat hanging on a peg . He took off his soaking wet clothes , washed his hands and face and rubbed himself vigorously all over with a grubby towel . The little cylindrical film can containing the negatives was still taped securely to his chest . He put his clothes back on , but substituted the signalman 's overcoat for his own sopping wet jacket . Now all he needed was transport . The signalman must have got here somehow . Faber went outside and found a bicycle padlocked to a rail on the other side of the small building . He snapped the little lock with the blade of his stiletto . Moving in a straight line away from the blank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cycle until he was out of sight of the building . Then he cut across until he reached the cinder track , climbed on the cycle and pedaledaway. 16Percival Godliman had brought a small camp bed from his home .

He had not suffered insomnia for almost forty years , not since he took his final exams at the university . He would gladly swap the anxieties of those days for the worries that kept him awake now . He had been a different man then , he knew ; not just younger , but also considerably less ... abstracted . He had been outgoing , aggressive , ambitious ; he planned to go into politics . He was not studious then  --  he had reason to be anxious about the exams . His two mismatched enthusiasms in those days had been debating and ballroom dancing .

He was no great womanizer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not because he believed in any high-minded principles to that effect , I but because that was the way he felt about it . And so he had been a virgin until he met Eleanor , who was not one of the debutantes but a brilliant graduate mathematician with grace and warmth and a father dying of lung disease after forty years as a coal mine worker . He had taken her to meet his people . His father was Lord Lieutenant of the county , and the house had seemed a mansionto Eleanor , but she had been natural and charming and not in the least awestruck ; and when Percy 's mother had been disgracefully condescending to her at one point she had reacted with merciless wit , for which he loved her all the more . He had taken his master 's degree , then after the Great War he taught in a public school and stood in three by-150 Ken Follett EYE OF THE NEEDLE 151elections . They were both disappointed when they discoveredthey could not have children ; but they loved each other totally and they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Godliman ever knew . It had ended his interest in the real world , and he had retreated into the Middle Ages . It had drawn him and Bloggs together , this common bereavement . And the war had brought him back to life ; revivedin him those characteristics of dash and aggression and fervor that had made him a fine speaker and teacher and the hope of the Liberal Party . He wished very much for something in Bloggs 's life to rescue him from an existence of bitterness and introspection . At the moment he was in Godliman 's thoughts , Bloggs phoned from Liverpool to say that Die Nadel had slipped through the net , and Parkin had been killed . Godliman , sitting on the edge of the camp bed to speak on the phone , closed his eyes . " I should have put you on the train ... " " Thanks ! " Bloggs said . " Only because he does n't know your face . " " I think he may , " Bloggs said . " We suspect he spotted the trap , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got off the train . " " But where could he have seen you  --  oh , Leicester Square . " " I do n't see how , but then ... we seem to underestimatehim . " Godliman asked impatiently , " Have you got the ferry covered ? " " Yes . " " He wo n't use it , of course  --  too obvious . He 's more likely to steal a boat . On the other hand , he may still be heading for Inverness . " " I 've alerted the police up there . " " Good . But look , I do n't think we can make any assumptionsabout his destination . Let 's keep an open mind . " " Yes . " Godliman stood , picked up the phone , and began to pace the carpet . " Also , do n't assume it was he who got off the train on the wrong side . Work on the premise that he gotoff before , at , or after Liverpool . " Godliman 's brain was in gear again , sorting permutations and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " He 's here . " There was a pause , then a new voice said , " Chief SuperintendentAnthony speaking . " Godliman said , " Do you agree with me that our man got off this train somewhere in your area ? " " That seems likely , yes . " " All right . Now the first thing he needs is transport  --  so I want you to get details of every car , boat , bicycle , or donkey stolen within a hundred miles of Liverpool during the next twenty-four hours . Keep me informed , but give the information to Bloggs and work closely with him followingup the leads . " " Yes , sir . " " Keep an eye on other crimes that might be committed by a fugitive  --  theft of food or clothing , unexplained assaults , identity card irregularities , and so on . " " Right . " " Now , Mr. Anthony , you realize this man is more than just a conventional murderer ? " " I assume so , sir , from the fact of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ details . " " It 's a matter of national security , important enough to keep the Prime Minister in hourly contact with this office . " " Yes ... uh , Mr. Bloggs would like a word , sir . " Bloggs came back on . " Have you remembered how you know his face ? You said you thought you did  --  " " Oh , yes  --  and it 's of no value , as I predicted . I met him by chance at Canterbury Cathedral and we had a conversationabout the architecture . All it tells us is that he 's clever  --  he made some perceptive remarks , as I recall . " " We knew he was clever . " " As I said , it does us no good . " Chief Superintendent Anthony , a determined member of the middle class with a carefully softened Liverpool accent , did not know whether to be peeved at the way MI5 ordered him about or thrilled at the chance to save England on his own manor . Bloggs recognized the man 's conflict  --  he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ local police forces  --  and he knew how to tip the balance in his own favor . He said , " I 'm grateful for your helpfulness , Chief Superintendent . These things do n't go unnoticed in Whitehall , you know . " " Only doing our duty ... " Anthony was not sure whether he was supposed to call Bloggs " Sir . " " Still , there 's a big difference between reluctant assis- tance and willing help . " " Yes . Well , it 'll likely be a few hours before we pick up this man 's scent again . Do you want to catch forty winks ? " " Yes , " Bloggs said gratefully . " If you 've got a chair in a corner somewhere ... " " Stay here , " Anthony said , indicating his office . " I 'll be down in the operations room . I 'll wake you as soon as we 've got something . Make yourself comfortable . " Anthony went out , and Bloggs moved to an easy chair and sat back with his eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if projected onto the backs of his eye- lids like a film , saying , " There has to be an end to bereave- ment ... I do n't want you to make the same mistake ... " Bloggs realized suddenly that he did not want the war to end ; that would make him face issues , like the one Godli- man had raised . The war made life simple -- he knew why he hated the enemy and he knew what he was supposed to do about it . Afterward ... but the thought of another woman seemed disloyal . He yawned and slumped farther into his seat , his thinking becoming woolly as sleep crept up on him . If Christine had died before the war he would have felt very differently about remarrying . He had always been fond of her and respected her , of course ; but after she took that ambulance job respect had turned to near-awestruck admiration , and fondness turned to love . Then they had something special , something they knew other lovers did not share . Now , more than a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find an- other woman he could respect and be fond of , but he knew that would no longer be enough for him . An ordinary mar- riage , an ordinary woman , would always remind him that once he , a rather ordinary man , had had the most extraordi- nary of women .... He stirred in his chair , trying to shake off his thoughts so that he could sleep . England was full of heroes , Godlimanhad said . Well , if Die Nadel got away .. . First things first ... . Someone shook him . He was in a very deep sleep , dreaming that he was in a room with Die Nadel but could not pick him out because Die Nadel had blinded him with a stiletto . When he awoke he still thought he was blind because he could not see who was shaking him , until he realized he simply had his eyes closed . He opened them to see the large uniformed figure of Superintendent Anthony above him . Bloggs raised himself to a more upright position and rubbed his eyes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of things , " Anthony said . " Question is , which of ' em counts ? Here 's your breakfast . " He put a cup of tea and a biscuit on the desk and went to sit on the other side of it . Bloggs left his easy chair and pulled a hard chair up to the desk . He sipped the tea . It was weak and very sweet . " Let 's get to it , " he said . Anthony handed him a sheaf of five or six slips of paper . Bloggs said , " Do n't tell me these are the only crimes in your area  --  " " Of course not , " Anthony said . " We 're not interested in drunkenness , domestic disputes , blackout violations , traffic offenses , or crimes for which arrests have already been made . " " Sorry , " Bloggs said . " I 'm still waking up . Let me read these . " There were three house burglaries . In two of them valuableshad been taken  --  jewelry in one case , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steal valuables just to throw us off the scent . Mark these on the map , will you ? They may show some pattern . " He handed the two slips back to Anthony . The third burglary had only just been reported , and no details were available . Anthony marked the location on the map . A Food Office in Manchester had been robbed of hundreds of ration books . Bloggs said , " He does n't need ration books  --  he needs food . " He set that one aside . There was a bicycle theft just outside Preston and a rape in Birk-154 Ken Follett EYE OF THE NEEDLE 155enhead . " I do n't think he 's a rapist , but mark it anyway , " Bloggs told Anthony . The bicycle theft and the third of the house burglaries were close together . Bloggs said , " The signal box that the bike was stolen from  --  is that on the main line ? " " Yes , I think so , " Anthony said . " Suppose Faber was hiding on that train and somehow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first place the train stopped at after it left Liverpool ? " " It might be . " Bloggs looked at the sheet of paper . " An overcoat was stolen and a wet jacket left in its place . " Anthony shrugged . " Could mean anything . " " No cars stolen ? " " Nor boats , nor donkeys , " Anthony replied . " We do n't get many car thefts these days . Cars are easy to come by  --  it 's petrol people steal . " " I felt sure he 'd steal a car in Liverpool , " Bloggs said . He thumped his knee in frustration . " A bicycle is n't much use to him , surely . " " I think we should follow it up , anyway , " Anthony pressed . " It 's our best lead . " " All right . But meanwhile , double-check the burglaries to see whether food or clothing was pinched  --  the victims might not have noticed at first . Show Faber 's picture to the rape victim , too . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Preston ? " " I 'll get you a car , " Anthony said . " How long will it take to get details of this third burglary ? " " They 're probably interviewing at this minute , " Anthony said . " By the time you reach the signal box I should have the complete picture . " " Do n't let them drag their feet . " Bloggs reached for his coat . " I 'll check with you the minute I get there . " " Anthony ? This is Bloggs . I 'm at the signal box . " " Do n't waste any time there . The third burglary was your man . " " Sure ? " " Unless there are two buggers running around threateningpeople with stiletto knives . " " Who ? " " Two old ladies living alone in a little cottage . " " Oh , God . Dead ? " " Not unless they died of excitement . " " Eh ? " " Get over there . You 'll see what I mean . " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of cottage that is always inhabited by two elderly ladies living alone . It was small and square and old , and around the door grew a wild rose bush fertilized by thousands of pots of used tea leaves . Rows of vegetables sprouted tidily in a little front garden with a trimmed hedge . There were pink-and-white curtains at the leaded windows , and the gate creaked . The front door had been painted painstakingly by an amateur , and its knocker was made from a horseshoe . Bloggs knock was answered by an octogenarian with a shotgun . He said , " Good morning . I 'm from the police . " " No , you 're not , " she said . " They 've been already . Now get going before I blow your head off . " Bloggs regarded her . She was less than five feet tall , with thick white hair in a bun and a pale , wrinkled face . Her hands were matchstick-thin , but her grasp on the shotgun was firm . The pocket of her apron was full of clothes-pegs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that she was wearing a man 's working boots . He said : " The police you saw this morning were local . I 'm from Scotland Yard . " " How do I know that ? " she said . Bloggs turned and called to his police driver . The constablegot out of the car and came to the gate . Bloggs said to the old lady , " Is the uniform enough to convince you ? " " All right , " she said , and stood aside for him to enter . He stepped down into a low-ceilinged room with a tiled floor . The room was crammed with heavy , old furniture , and every surface was decorated with ornaments of china and glass . A small coal fire burned in the grate . The place smelled of lavender and cats. 156 Ken Follett EYE OF THE NEEDLE 157A second old lady got out of a chair . She was like the first , but about twice as wide . Two cats spilled from her lap as she rose . She said , " Hello , I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take any notice of that shotgun  --  it 's not loaded , thank God . Jessie loves drama . Will you sit down ? You look so young to be a policeman . I 'm surprised ScotlandYard is interested in our little robbery . Have you come from London this morning ? Make the boy a cup of tea , Jessie . " Bloggs sat down . " If we 're right about the identity of the burglar , he 's a fugitive from justice , " he said . " I told you ! " Jessie said . " We might have been done . in  --  slaughtered in cold blood ! " " Do n't be silly , " Emma said . She turned to Bloggs . " He was such a nice man . " " Tell me what happened , " Bloggs said . " Well , I 'd gone out the back , " Emma began . " I was in the hen coop , hoping for some eggs . Jessie was in the kitchen  --  " " He surprised me , " Jessie interrupted . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gun . " " You see too many cowboy films , " Emma admonished her . " They 're better than your love films  --  all tears and kisses  --  " Bloggs took the picture of Faber from his wallet . " Is this the man ? " Jessie scrutinized it . " That 's him . " " Are n't you clever ? " Emma marveled . " If we were so clever we 'd have caught him by now , " Bloggs said . " What did he do ? " Jessie said , " He held a knife to my throat and said , One false move and I 'll slit your gizzard . ' I believe he meant it . " " Oh , Jessie , you told me he said , I wo n't harm you if you do as I say . ' " " Words to that effect , Emma ! " Bloggs said , " What did he want ? " " Food , a bath , dry clothes and a car . Well , we gave him the eggs , of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late husband , Norman  --  " " Would you describe them ? " " Yes . A blue donkey jacket , blue overalls , a check shirt . And he took poor Norman 's car . I do n't know how we 'll he able to go to the pictures without it . That 's our only vice , you know  --  the pictures . " " What sort of car ? " " A Morris . Norman bought it in 1924 . It 's served us well , that little car . " Jessie said , " He did n't get his hot bath , though ! " " Well , " Emma said , " I had to explain to him that two ladies living alone can hardly have a man taking a bath in their kitchen ... " Jessie said : " You 'd rather have your throat slit than see a man in his combinations , would n't you , you silly fool . " Bloggs said , " What did he say when you refused ? " " He laughed , " Emma said . " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help but smile . " I think you 're very brave , " he said . " I do n't know about that , I 'm sure . " " So he left here in a 1924 Morris , wearing overalls and a blue jacket . What time was that ? " " About half-past nine . " Bloggs absently stroked a red tabby cat . It blinked and purred . " Was there much petrol in the car ? " " A couple of gallons  --  but he took our coupons . " " How do you ladies qualify for a petrol ration ? " " Agricultural purposes , " Emma said defensively . Sheblushed . Jessie snorted . " And we 're isolated , and we 're elderly . Of course we qualify . " " We always go to the corn stores at the same time as the pictures , " Emma added . " We do n't waste petrol . " Bloggs smiled and held up a hand . " All right , do n't worry  --  rationing is n't exactly my department . How fast does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never exceed thirty miles per hour . " Bloggs looked at his watch . " Even at that speed he could be seventy-five miles away by now . " He stood up . " I must phone the details to Liverpool . You do n't have a telephone , do you ? " " No. " 158 Ken Follett " What kind of Morris is it ? " " A Cowley . Norman used to call it a Bullnose . " " Color ? " " Grey . " " Registration number ? " " MLN 29 . " Bloggs wrote it all down . Emma said , " Will we ever get our car back , do you think ? " " I expect so  --  but it may not be in very good condition . When someone is driving a stolen car he generally does n't take good care of it . " He walked to the door . " I hope you catch him , " Emma called . Jessie saw him out . She was still clutching the shotgun . At the door she caught Bloggs 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me  --  what is he ? Escaped convict ? Murderer ? Rapist ? " Bloggs looked down at her . Her small green eyes were bright with excitement . He bent his head to speak quietly in her ear . " Do n't tell a soul , " he murmured , " but he 's a German spy . " She giggled with delight . Obviously , she thought , he saw the same movies she did. 17Faber crossed the Sark Bridge and entered Scotland shortly after midday . He passed the Sark Toll Bar House , a low building with a signboard announcing that it was the first house in Scotland and a tablet above the door bearing some legend about marriages which he could not read . A quarter of a mile farther on he understood , when he entered the village of Gretna ; he knew this was a place runaways came to get married . The roads were still damp from the early rain , but the sun was drying them rapidly . Signposts and nameboards had been re-erected since the relaxation of invasion precautions , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kirkpatrick , Kirtlebridge , Ecclefechan . The open countryside was pleasant , the green moor sparkling in the sunshine . He had stopped for petrol in Carlisle . The pump attendant , a middle-aged woman in an oily apron , had not asked any awkward questions . Faber had filled the tank and the spare can fixed to the offside running board . He was very pleased with the little two-seater . It would still do fifty miles an hour , despite its age . The four-cylinder , 1548 cc side-valve engine worked smoothly and tirelesslyas he climbed and descended the Scottish hills . The leather-upholstered bench seat was comfortable . He squeezed the bulb horn to warn a straying sheep of his approach . He went through the little market town of Lockerbie , crossed the River Annan by the picturesque Johnstone Bridge , and began the ascent to Beattock Summit . He found himself using the three-speed gearbox more and more.
