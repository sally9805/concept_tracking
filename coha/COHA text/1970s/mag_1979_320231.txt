" Black work " and a thrift ethic help them handle those prices <P> It used to be that Americans returned from a vacation across the Atlantic full of tales of shopping bargains and cheap travel . No longer . Today , most return with their wallets empty , their credit cards fully charged and their spirits shaken by how little the dollar now buys . Many wonder just how Europeans can afford to live at all in Western Europe , let alone so well . <P> Prices are indeed high . In the shopping meccas of Paris ' Rue du Faubourg-Saint-Honor , Munich 's Maximilianstrasse or Brussels ' Avenue Louise , a Pierre Cardin tie costs $40 , a Rty suit $440 and a Balenciaga handbag $370 . Even the cost of window-shopping is steep . Hotel rooms in a smart area of a capital city can easily cost $75 a night , a good dinner for two starts at $60 or more , and a week 's car rental often tops $300 . Local residents , of course , avoid the stores and services that tourists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A modest two-bedroom house in a suburb rents for $1,600 a month ; a gallon of gas costs $2.30 or more , a pair of Levi 's about $40 , cigarettes $1.10 to $2.70 , newspapers at least 40 and a pound of steak up to $11 . <P> But while surveys show that compared with America , living costs are up to 73% higher in Switzerland and about 40% higher in West Germany and France , it is also true that European salaries are occasionally richer . A recent study by a U.S. management consulting firm , Towers , Perrin , Forster &; Crosby , calculates that the chief executive of a typical medium-size company in Germany earns 50% more than his U.S. counterpart , 40% more in Belgium and The Netherlands , and 20% more in France . Business International , a Geneva research firm , notes that in Switzerland today , a receptionist now gets $19,700 a year , an executive secretary $27,000 and a salesman $37,000 . <P> Though part of the rise in European pay ( and prices ) when expressed in dollars reflects the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not explain all the difference . In real terms , incomes have simply risen much faster in Europe than in America . According to the Paris-based Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development ( O.E.C.D. ) , between 1972 and 1977 the annual increase in the average hourly wage in the U.S. was less than 1% above the inflation rate . But in Europe , wages have stayed ahead of prices by much greater margins : more than 5% in France , Belgium , Norway and Italy , and over 3% in Germany . <P> Part of Europeans ' gains have been wiped out by their higher taxes ; a typical Belgian family earning $56,000 will keep no more than $32,000 . But though their taxes are generally lower , Americans must shell out more of their incomes for medical and educational expenses , both of which are largely free in Europe . The net result is that many Europeans end up with somewhat fatter disposable incomes than Americans but they also face generally much higher prices . So how do they do it ? How do they afford the rows of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are so conspicuous to visitors ?
