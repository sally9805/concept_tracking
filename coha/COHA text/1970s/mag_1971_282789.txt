With her bright red lips , flashing fire-engine fingernails and dramatically mascaraed eyes , the woman of ' 71 looks like Marilyn Monroe of the ' 50s , Rita Hayworth of the ' 40s , Marlene Dietrich of the ' 30s or even Theda Bara of the ' 20s . Anybody , that is , but the so-called natural-looking woman of the ' 60s . The cosmetics makers and the fashion magazines have passed the word : the natural , no-makeup look is a bore . Flashy cosmetic colors are back . <P> Deep Colors . The experts do not phrase it precisely that way . " I would use the words deeper and more vibrant to describe the look , " says the beauty editor of one of the leading fashion magazines . " It involves the forthright use of makeup and more colors . " The house of Este Lauder , which first introduced what it calls the " civilized look " in 1969 and has heavily advertised it ever since , heralds it as " the return to real makeup . " Revlon followed with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , from brown and purple to bright red , a color not seen on fashionable women since the ' 50s . <P> People in the cosmetics business claim , however , that the new hues have little to do with those of the ' 40s or ' 50s . The new colors , they maintain , are so sophisticated that it is now possible to have a mulled russet eye shadow , a Dubonnet-toned rouge and a nail polish that falls somewhere between brown and mauve . Red lipstick in the ' 40s tended to be blue-red and caky in consistency ; the ' 70s red is clear and guaranteed not to cake . So wide is the range of colors she has before her , a woman can now be her own Gauguin when she dabs away in front of her cosmetics mirror . <P> That range , in fact , has sent the manufacturers into an orgy of name giving . Charles Revson has come up with such goodies as Baby Biscuit and Raisins for his Etherea line . Este Lauder has picked Coffee Brandy and Ginger Brandy for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On the theory that a French phrase or two is equally intoxicating , Christian Dior has countered with Chataigne Dor eye shadow and Brume de Rose lipstick . <P> Basic Black . The return to classic clothes is giving added impetus to the rush toward the " more sophisticated " look . Longer skirts , heavier fabrics and the once again popular basic black demand an accenting feature , and this season it will be a colorful face . No firm seems more confident of that trend than London 's Biba Cosmetics , which already is selling lipsticks in Prune and Magenta shades . This fall , Biba will add to its lipstick line two colors that are bound to make men happy to see red : Matisse Green and Royal Blue .
