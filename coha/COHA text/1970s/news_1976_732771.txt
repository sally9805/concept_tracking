txt The power struggle in China over the succession to the late Chairman Mao Tse-tung has led to serious shadow boxing involving both the Soviet Union and the United States . On the Soviet side , there has been a probably " inspired " dispatch from a Soviet journalist to London and Paris newspapers . It is being interpreted as meaning that Moscow will once again take the gloves off with Peking if recently installed Chairman Hua Kuo-feng does not stop his anti-Soviet line and respond appropriately to the muting of anti-Chinese propaganda from the Soviet Union since Chairman Mao 's passing last month . On the American side , there was ( little noticed at the time last week ) a statement by Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger at a news conference in Boston . The Secretary said : " The territorial integrity and sovereignty of China is very important to the world equilibrium and we will consider it a grave matter if this were threatened by an outside power . " Moscow is clearly concerned to use the uncertainty or fluidity in Peking at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at or near the top in China and to encourage in Chinese diplomacy a less hostile attitude toward all things Russian . Washington is concerned to discourage the Russians ( or anybody else , such as the Chinese Nationalists in Taiwan ) from using the present uncertainty in Peking at the moment to make any move against China itself . The State Department , questioned about the significance of the Secretary 's Boston statement , insists ( according to reports reaching here ) that it was merely a restatement of earlier U.S. policy . But to many , the timing of the restatement is interesting . In one sense , Secretary Kissinger 's remark is a counterweight to former U.S. Defense Secretary James R. Schlesinger 's clinical conclusions after a recent visit to China , on which he was accompanied by // From ? age 1 * Moscow and Peking in a test of wills Time magazine 's diplomatic editor .

Western sources who specialize in Soviet attitudes toward China find the Louis indications deeply interesting . If Mr. Louis is right , the sources say , Moscow could revert to the kind of anti-Peking rhetoric it has noticeably dropped since Mao 's China was designed to take advantage of Chinese-Soviet rivalry . The sources note ? again if Mr. Louis is right ? that like any skilled diplomatic strategist , Moscow is refusing to tip its ultimate hand in advance . But the sources do not believe that Moscow is actually likely to resort to military threats . Nor do they really expect that the " month " Mr. Louis refers to is a hard and fast time period . Instead they see its significance in the implication of a definite time limit ? and in the im pression given that the new Chinese leader , Hua Kuo-fang , really can not expect Moscow to keep its tone of sweet reasonableness intact indefinitely in the face of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ month . Mr. Louis himself , denied to this newspaper that his articles contained any ring of an " ultimatum . " He emphasized he was simply trying to show that Moscow 's wait-and-see attitude so far has been advocated by an older generation of Russians who knew many Chinese personally in earlier days . This generation believed that those Chinese still knew very well that China needed military and other aid from Moscow . They might yet want to find a " common language " with Moscow . Some analysts believe that Moscow is likely to wait much longer than a month for any possible Chinese response to Moscow 's current mild tone . These analysts do keep open the possibility that Mr. Louis , who has written against the Chinese in the past , may only be airing a policy dispute within the Kremlin rather than reflecting actual decisions taken .
