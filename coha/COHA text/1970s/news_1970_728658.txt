txt President Nixon has changed an impression that he gave last month . The reason is not clear . He now says that American Air Force missions will be carried on in Cambodia after the rest of the American forces are out . He also says that South Vietnamese troops may remain . They will withdraw from the sanctuaries . But their actions in Cambodia thereafter " will be determined by the actions of the enemy . " Last month Mr. Nixon said , " I would expect that the South Vietnamese would come out of Cambodia at approximately the same time that we do , because when we come out . . . our air support will also come out . . . . " Array of forces Why the apparent reversal ? Is it a real change of direction ? One reason suggested here is the gathering battle for control of all Cambodia , its government and its capital city , that is taking place west of the sanctuaries out of bounds to the American troops which now are being withdrawn . A hastily improvised array @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in case the North Vietnamese try to push westward across the Mekong River to seize the rest of Cambodia . They include battalions trained by Thailand , Cambodian mercenaries trained in Vietnam by the United States , the slender , untrained regular Army of Cambodia , and various fighting units from South Vietnam . Original reason quoted It is not yet clear whether the Communist North Vietnamese will choose to make a determined thrust across the Mekong . Under similar circumstances last winter , they refrained from toppling the pro-Western government of Laos  --  perhaps because they did not want to overextend themselves and bring the Thais into the war against them . At any rate , a small array of forces , with token help from Thailand and some American air support , was able to block their path . A similar collection of forces now might block the path to Phnom Penh ? provided the South Vietnamese troops were not withdrawn from central Cambodia and provided that American warplanes assisted at key times and places . // *Nixon air strategy in Cambodia ? // The question of policy raised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this : Has Mr. Nixon extended his aim in Cambodia to include the defense of its newly established pro-Western government and the rest of the country ? Mr. Nixon this week quoted his original given reason for going into Cambodia : " We take this action not for the purpose of expanding the war into Cambodia . . ? . Once enemy forces are driven out of these sanctuaries and once their military supplies are destroyed , we will withdraw . " He did not mention defense of the Cambodian Government . The President now says , in this week 's televised report to the nation , that American air missions will be continued " . .. to interdict the movement of enemy troops and material where I find this is necessary to protect the lives and security of our forces in South Vietnam . " He could easily decide that loss of all Cambodia to the Communists was such a threat . That could be interpreted as an enlargement of the American aim in Cambodia , to the extent that American air power would help to achieve it in collaboration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could decide to confine the use of American air missions to movements of enemy troops and supplies , banning close-in support for the South Vietnamese forces . There is quite a different interpretation that could be placed on this week 's talk by the President . He might be warning Hanoi that South Vietnamese armed forces and American air power would be used against it , in the event of a power drive westward across the Mekong . His purpose could be to dissuade Hanoi from deciding to make such an attempt . He might privately be planning not to use American air power in important strength unless it were actually necessary , and perhaps not even then . But . Hanoi would not know this , and would have to prepare for the worst . Calculated uncertainty like this is a normal part of standard military maneuver in tight situations like the present one in central Cambodia . It was used against North Vietnam in Laos last winter and may have contributed to halting the Communist attack . Withdrawal commitment Mr. Nixon already has had to tie one hand behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by announcing that American ground troops would definitely be withdrawn . Aides have said flatly that they would not return . By feinting now with American air power and South Vietnamese forces , the American President ? might keep some salutary uncertainty in the picture . The uncertainty also remains for the American public and for newsmen striving to understand the President 's latest remarks . Critics who feared that Mr. Nixon would be drawn beyond the sanctuaries into open-ended war in Cambodia , and who Mr. Nixon said raised " an unprecedented barrage of criticism " against him , now are renewing their apprehension . Supporters of the President will emphasize that he did not directly assume an obligation to defend the Cambodian Government , even with air power , and that the fears of the opposition are overdrawn . Mr. Nixon will clear up the ambiguity starting July 1 by whatever air action he does or does not take in central Cambodia , whether it is in support of South Vietnamese troops , and how large or small it turns out to be .     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
