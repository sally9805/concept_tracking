In the five months that he served as special Watergate prosecutor , Archibald Cox more than made good on his promise to follow any trail , " wherever that trail may lead , " in his investigation . Cox and his 80-man legal staff brought criminal charges in 14 cases , and at the time of his ouster they were investigating literally dozens of criminal allegations extending far beyond the Watergate breakin . Indeed , it was the unfettered scope of Cox 's inquiries that led Nixon to the angry decision that he had to go . <P> TIME has learned that the White House seemed especially upset about Cox 's determination to pursue these areas of investigation : <P> &gt; The " Town House Project , " which raised up to $4,000,000 in campaign funds for Nixon-favored congressional and gubernatorial candidates in the 1970 election . The operation was so named because it was headquartered in the basement of a private town house four blocks from the White House . Directed by former White House Employee Jack Gleason , the effort was conducted before present campaign-financing laws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been made public . The story of how the money was raised and what became of it is presumably still contained in a satchel of reports that Gleason delivered to former White House Counsel Charles Colson in December 1970 . Cox 's investigators believed that the Town House operation is potentially one of the most explosive scandals in Washington , but White House lawyers refused to provide information about it on the ground that Cox had no claim to evidence bearing on any campaign except that of 1972 . ( To invalidate that contention , Cox three weeks ago charged a Democratic donor to Hubert Humphrey 's 1968 campaign with making an illegal contribution . ) <P> &gt; The handling of anti-Nixon demonstrators at 1972 rallies attended by the President in Illinois and Tennessee , the latter featuring Billy Graham as a booster . Some of the activists , as well as witnesses , have accused Secret Service agents and White House advance men of interfering with the civil rights of peaceful protesters . <P> &gt; Exploits of the White House " plumbers " that have not yet come fully to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such an investigation , claiming that some of the team 's activities involved the " national security . " <P> &gt; The White House-authorized campaign to tap the telephones of certain Administration aides and outside newsmen . <P> In addition to these investigative avenues specifically challenged by the Administration , the Cox task force was looking into a wide variety of other reported criminal acts . They range from " dirty tricks " allegedly committed in behalf of candidates of both parties to various allegations of perjury . Yet the central thrust seems directed at the all but endless amounts of cash raised by Nixon 's moneymen during the last three biennial elections-some $60 million for the 1972 race alone .
