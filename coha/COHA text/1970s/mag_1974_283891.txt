The Civil War confrontation that changed the course of naval warfare forever and brought an end to the era wooden battleships was the fierce , four-hour battle between the U.S.S. Monitor and the Confederate Merrimack Hampton Roads , Va. , on March 9,1862 . The contest between the two legendary ironclad men-of-war-the first of its kind in naval history-wound up in a banging , clanging draw , and in May 1862 the Merrimack was scuttled to keep it from falling into the hands of the advancing Union forces . The Monitor met a different fate . Nine months after the fight , she sank in a gale off Cape Hatteras , N.C. , taking 16 members of her 63-man crew down with her . The precise spot where the ship-with her eight layers of 1-in. iron plates and two 111n. guns in a revolving turret-went down remained a mystery . <P> Now a team of oceanographers has located the Monitor in a storm-swept spot 15 miles southeast of Cape Hatteras , at a murky depth of 220 ft . Using sonar equipment to locate the site and an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the team has pieced together portions of video tape to confirm that the Monitor 's broken hull lies upside down in the water , partly buried under 3 ft. of sediment . But the ruins of the ship are so fragile that attempts to lift them from the ocean depths would probably cause the 112 year-old vessel to fall apart , and for now it will have to remain at rest in the deep .
