18 Stanley Kauffmann on films Lenny ( United Artists ) The first image is a mouth in immense close-up , with the down visible under the lower lip . I thought it was Lenny Bruce , unshaved . Then the mouth speaks , with a woman 's voice . The camera pulls back : it 's Honey , Lenny 's ex-wife , a bit raddled , being interviewed " today " in the soft yet prying daylight that pervades this black-andwhite picture . The tonality of light comes from Bruce Surtees ' fine photography . ( He did Sweet Charity , in color . ) The editing , nervous or cruelly fixed as and when it needs to be , is by Alan Heim , who edited Godspell . These two men , best known for their work on musicals , collaborate here with a director , Bob Fosse , whose name was made in theater and film as a choreographer and who directed the film of Cabaret . Thus ? rightly , I think ? the biography of the nightclub comic was put in the hands of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ method and matter , is doubled by Fosse himself . He has moved here toward a directing style that would itself approximate the anarchic effect that Bruce used to have with his performances . Apparently Fosse has modeled his work on the arch-anarchist of our film era , Godard . ( Which is only fair because Godard has acknowledged his admiration of Fosse . See Godard 's review of The Pajama Game or Belmondo 's line about Fosse in tine Femme est une Femme . ) The ambiguity of the enormous opening close-up , resolved only by pulling back ; the nearly subliminal cutting at times , like Honey 's opening strip act , which gives us her body as through a prism ; and , for contrast , the very long , unbroken long-shot later in the film , when Lenny comes out to do his act full of heroin and sick , his raincoat over his jockey shorts , wearing only one sock ? all these devices are pure Godard . Lenny wants to be , in form and feeling , an anarchic " act " about a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that form and feeling , it succeeds much more than in what is actually said and done . This is certainly not to knock the performances , all of which are good and some of which are far better than that . Dustin Hoffman is , one can say , back . The night before I saw Lenny I saw some of Midnight Cowboy again on TV and marveled again at how , through the cinematic shenanigans , Hoffman and-Jon Voight give the work validity . I wondered whether Hoffman would ever work that hard again , after the lazings of Papillon and other pictures . He works , hard and well , in Lenny . He has evidently studied , as well he might , the Lenny Bruce Performance Film , made by John Magnuson in 1965 at a San Francisco night club ? a 65-minute unbroken take of Bruce 's next-to-last performance . But Hoffman does more than give a good imitation of Bruce , as Bruce did of , say , Barry Fitzgerald in his Father Flotsky bit . Hoffman tries , as far as the script permits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He lacks , I think , the last manic charge that Elliott Gould ( who is physically wrong for the part ) might have given it , but Hoffman engraves very sharply the lineaments of a ferret who ferreted out his own true talents ? moving from stock jokester to wild blasphemer ? behind the cover of the " tits and ass " of cheap strip joints ; and then , on the wave of his own release and the era 's hunger , moved in front of the girls to disembowel himself on the altar of outrage . The journalist who first wrote seriously of Bruce , Ralph J. Gleason , made what I still think is the most helpful comment about his method : " Bruce 's whole orientation is that of the jazz musician . " Bruce 's riffs and runs are like a jazz player 's on a theme , improvisations of hot , almost sexual abandon that are an evanescent escape , a knowingly futile blow at ugliness . Hoffman gets a lot of all this , very well , very movingly . Valerie Perrine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ script , is almost as good : a woman who lives and suffers by sexuality , whose values are scaled to a relatively small but intensely detailed moral landscape . Jan Miner is appealingly coarse as Bruce 's mother . Stanley Beck is exact as the ( fictitious ) agent , who of course looks younger in the " today " sequences , with long hair and mod shades , than in the flashbacks of 15 years earlier . And Gary Morton gives an appropriately loathsome caricature of a famous loathsome comic , under a pseudonym . The film 's troubles are in the script by Julian Barry , who wrote the poor play THE NEW REPUBLIC of the same name . But the troubles here are not exactly the same . The play was toothless and was festooned with arty touches ? giant puppets ? by the director Tom O'Horgan . The film script has none of that artiness and it does have some teeth : the trouble is that they are taken out , like dentures , and shown to us . For instance , during one performance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him " nigger " ; then he spots others whom he identifies as " kike , " " spick , " " wop , " etc . The real Bruce would have kept on using those terms without mitigation , possibly to make us see how close we all are to using them , even if we do n't admit it , and anyway just to make us angry and to make us laugh at our embarrassment over our anger . But Barry 's Bruce explains . He explains that he 's repeating those terms in order to take the sting out of them , so that no little kid will . ever be hurt by them again . And there are biographical gaps and distortions , as one can tell from the Albert Goldman-Lawrence Schiller hook . The wildness of Bruce 's sex life is only sketched . His odd ? relation with Honey is only sketched . ( Was he , for instance , responsible for her drug arrest in Hawaii ? The film never touches the matter . ) His discovery of his " dirtiness " as performer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His decline into drugs is shown but not motivated or dramatized , as is his decline into legal- ( confirmed on page 33 ) SK F DECEMBER 14 , 1974 asked to work long hours of overtime ; thus the abnormal state of affairs is supposed to become the normal . No American worker would tolerate it ; but on the other hand , most American industries know how to be efficient , while British - industries are possessed of the cottage , . industry mentality . It is not that the English enjoy their - problems ; it is simply that they do not know how to solve them , and are in desperate need of help ; help which will . cause them to see anew . In a country that still has an outmoded legal system ( barrister , solicitor , clerks who negotiate fees between each , junior barristers and junior solicitors who accompany seniors , etc. ) , it is little wonder that anything else is modern or efficient . The quaintness of everything is , I fear , being paid for by an awful inflation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . J. M. B. Crawford London Kauffmann , from page 18 istic boringness . During his last months in New York , people I knew who knew Bruce said they could hardly bear to visit him , he was so hung up on law talk . This is shown in the film , after his obscenity busts , but not connected psychologically with anything we have seen before . There are gaps in the script that are supposed to be filled in either by our knowledge of Bruce or of movies : either by facts or by the conventional strophes of disintegration in film heroes . However I ca n't help noting that much of the clamor against the sentimental distortion of Bruce 's life comes from people who raised no protest against the sentimental distortion of Christopher lsherwood 's fiction in Fosse 's last film , Cabaret . Evidently facts are more important than works of art . Further , I hope that the film will serve one real purpose : I hope it will close the subject of Lenny Bruce . I do n't want to get involved in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never saw him in person ? but as authentic and significant as he was , the Bruce aggrandizement , the glib comparisons with Voltaire and Swift , the effort to make him a figure of ongoing importance seem to me a bit foolish . To know no more about Bruce than is in this wobbly script is to know that he contributed to the ' 70s temper ; but was he its onlie begetter ? He suffered from prosecution on obscenity charges ; but would n't he have been a failure if he had been unprosecuted ? He suffered from harassment by narcotics police ; but that puts him on a rather long list . Now , after the numerous plays and films and articles and books , the debt , if that 's what it was , looks to have been paid .
