" La-a-a-a-dies and gentillllmen : the Greatest Show on Earrth ! " Charlton Heston , dressed in black boots , white pants , scarlet coat and top hat , was kicking off the celebrity-filled first night of Ringling Bros , and Barnum &; Bailey in Los Angeles . Walter Matthau turned up as one of the clowns . " I was raised in an orphanage , and I went to the circus for the first time when I was twelve , " Matthau recalled . " It was one of the happiest times of my childhood . " Matthau 's son Charlie , 10 , was crowned King of the Circus . Then came the grand parade of elephants with spangled riders led off by Sonny and Cher and their daughter Chastity , 4 , who was crowned Queen of the Circus . Star after star - from Carol Burnett to Jimmy Stewart-rode once around the ring , helping to raise $25,000 for the S.S. Hope , a floating clinic full of doctors who sail the seas to teach medicine in underdeveloped countries . <P> " The music consisted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hammering all their might on a hundred anvils and artillery , " wrote Painter Thomas Eakins to his sister Fanny about the Boston Jubilee in the summer of 1869 . The letter , one of 20 recently given to the Archives of American Art , a part of the Smithsonian complex in Washington , D.C. , went on to observe that " Bostonians have music on the brain . " Added the proper Philadelphian : " God forbid they should get art there , or they will get some hundred firemen to copy a Jerome or Meissonier a thousand times bigger than the original to hang up in their coliseum . " <P> Will Colinot Trousse Chemise be Brigitte Bardot 's last picture ? So she says . The French title is almost impossible to translate , but trousser means to hitch up a skirt , a shirt or whatever . Colinot , a 14th century peasant boy , does just that to the ladies . After finishing Colinot in Auvergne a few weeks ago , B.B. , 38 , is now cruising around Corsica with her boy friend Laurent Vergez @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intends to find herself a farm-unless someone talks her out of early retirement . <P> Seated among the few morning spectators in the London law court was a tall , familiar American figure . As the head of a select group of U.S. jurists observing British justice at work during a two-week Anglo-American exchange program , Chief Justice Warren Burger was on a busman 's holiday . On a London street a senior British official was pleased to find Burger sufficiently briefed to congratulate him on a very recent appointment . The official , in turn , offered his congratulations to Burger as just about the only man in Washington who had not lost his job in the past six months . Burger , the official reported later , was not amused .
