THE historical area known as Palestine was originally bounded to the west by the Mediterranean Sea and to the south by the Sinai Desert . To the north it included a sliver of Lebanon and to the east it stretched beyond the Jordan River . Today , Israel holds most of the territory . <P> Jewish domination in Palestine diminished after the destruction of the Second Temple of Jerusalem in A.D. 70 , and in the Diaspora most Jews were ultimately scattered . The Bible notes that Palestine had been promised to the " seed of Abraham . " This properly applies to Arabs as well as Jews , since Abraham 's first son , Ishmael , was born of the Egyptian concubine Hagar and is thus the father of the Arabs . Though Arabs did not conquer Palestine until A.D. 634 , they have remained ever since , first as rulers and later as the subjects of an Ottoman hegemony that ended after the British captured Jerusalem in 1917 . The British took part of Palestine east of the Jordan River to create Transjordan as a reward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Turks . <P> In 1947 the U.N . partitioned what remained of Palestine into Jewish and Arab states . When Arab armies marched on the infant state of Israel the following year-and were clobbered-the Israelis retaliated by seizing 1,400 square miles of Arab territory . Transjordan 's King Abdullah , grandfather of the present King Hussein , annexed the Jordan River 's West Bank , a sizable chunk of Palestine ; he renamed his expanded kingdom simply Jordan . In the Six-Day War , Israel captured the West Bank as well as the Arab quarter of Jerusalem . This marked the 25th time that the old city , a holy place to three faiths , had changed hands .
