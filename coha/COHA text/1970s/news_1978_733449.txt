txt Senator ! Pmxmire and Brooke , the ranking members of the Committee o : - . ! Banking , Housing and Urban Affairs , recently took a cut at explaining New York City 's financial problems to the President of the United States , in 13 single-spaced pages . The cut was most unkind . It suggested that solution of the problems is impeded now only r , by a failure of New York will . The Senators maintain that the city 's financial requirements could be supplied by increased state aid and by further loans from city and state employee pension funds , from the Municipal Assistance Corporation and from the major New York banks . In their view , nothing is needed from the Federal Government . Let 's look at the facts . On June 30 , 1975 , New York City 's funded debt was $12.3 billion , almost 40 percent of it in notes that had to be paid off within a year . To head off catastrophe , the state and city created the Municipal Assistance Corporation to sell long-term bonds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they came due . The Federal Treasury agreed to provide new short-term money to pay the city 's running expenses during those periods each year when expenses exceeded income . By Nov. 1 , 1977 , New York 's basic debt had risen slightly ; in addition , it owed the Treasury $1.9 billion in short-term loans , which are to be repaid by next June 30 . In brief , New York City owes more money now than it owed at the time of the 1975 crisis . This was inevitable . The city 's major expenses have , included $2 billion a year in interest and debt repayment , and about $1 billion in welfare . If it is ever to balance its budget regularly ? assuming that its economy at least stays on an even keel ? it must reduce its debt payments . This can be done only by paying off some existing debt , and refinancing some of the rest . Its long-term solvency depends also on major relief from its uniquely heavy welfare load . ? In all , the Municipal Assistance Corporation believes that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the city 's interest and repayment burdens , while also giving it a soundly balanced budget . M.A.C . would probably be able to borrow that amount from the public , secured by the city 's sales-tax receipts , like previous M.A.C . . borrowings . Such a program , however , would leave the city totally without capital funds with which to repair its bridges , tunnels and other deteriorating facilities , and without the means to stimulate economic development . M.A.C . estimates the city 's capital needs at another $2.25 billion over three years , a sum that M.A.C . could not possibly finance because sales-tax receipts are not large enough . It has proposed that the Federal Treasury lend the city this long-term money . Even then , the city would still need some short-term seasonal financing , like the present Treasury loan , at least until M.A.C . has sold its bonds . Senators Proxmire and Brboke  --  whose committee is central to Federal policy in this area  --  believe that it is not necessary for the city to refinance and adjust its present debts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ balance its budget without such arrangements . They claim that the city 's future capital needs will be less than forecast by M.A.C . They also argued to the President that even without seasonal loans from the Treasury , the banks , the pension funds and the State of New York should be able to lend the city all the money it truly needs . ? The trouble with the Senators ' argument is that it overlooks the basic fact that the city 's interest and welfare loads prevent it from making progress toward a sound budget . Because of this , the city 's underwriters could not sell its notes three months ago . Because of this , the trustees of pension funds will be unable conscientiously to continue to put pensioners ' money into city bonds that the rating services will not approve . Because of this , the state must hesitate to commit further assets to the city , whose basic position can not command confidence with-. out a concerted plan for long-range assistance . The disclosure of the Senators ' letter has itself had a depressing effect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands . This means that if the city can not receive help from the Federal Government , the cost of any new loans would be still higher , and the possibility of balancing accounts even more remote . There is merit to the Senators ' contention that all parties to the New York City crisis must review the role each will have to play in solving it . But if no further help is forthcoming from the Federal Government , the other participants will find their own roles more difficult if not impossible . In the end , everyone would suffer in a disaster that need not occur .
