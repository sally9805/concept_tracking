JASON AND MEDEIA <P> by JOHN GARDNER <P> 354 pages . Knopf. $7.95 . <P> Once upon a legendary time there was this young Greek hero-handsome as a god . naturally , and the son of a king-who was promised the throne if he could perform one small , one merely impossible quest : bring back from far-off Asia Minor a golden fleece guarded by a monster that never slept . <P> Once upon a not-so-legendary time-a time when writers have to borrow their heroes and their morals if not their plots-Jason 's story is getting retold by the most unlikely of bards : a professor of Old and Middle English , living on an Illinois farm , over a thousand miles from the nearest wine-dark sea . <P> A feat more impossible than stealing the golden fleece ? Maybe . But John Gardner , a myth lifter from way back ( Grendel ) , pulls off his quest brilliantly-not just as a tour de force but as an act of profoundly contemporary writing . A novelist who often writes like a poet , Gardner here becomes a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ narration in blank verse like a very good translation of the Odyssey . He uses the story of Jason to confront his own moral dilemma , the characteristically American theme that runs through his writing , most recently in The Sunlight Dialogues : How can law and freedom be reconciled ? <P> Gardner 's Jason is a man whose struggles to gain justice for himself seem destined to do injustice to others . Betrayed of his royal inheritance , he finds himself betraying the birthrights of others to get it back : particularly Medeia , daughter of the King of Colchis , owner of the golden fleece . What a humiliation for a questing hero ! Jason builds a supership , the Argo. assembles his all-star crew of Argonauts , including Herakles . When he gets to Colchis , after all the usual obstacles , he finds that only by seducing Medeia-by making her betray her father and her brother-can he gain the fleece . <P> Like Euripides , Gardner picks up the tale years later . Medeia has contrived to have Jason 's uncle turned into mincemeat , and she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exile in Corinth . He is still after a throne , however , and about to betray Medeia to marry the daughter of the King of <P> Corinth . Is treason , alas , " life 's great norm " ? This , Gardner appears to say , is Jason 's real quest-to learn the hard way what , if any , are " the principles of faith between men " as they pursue self-interest . <P> Meanwhile , life and Gardner 's tale roil on , hardly a pallid allegory . Black waves tower about Jason and his crew . Popular stock characters are recalled : Circe , the Sirens . Libations of pure wine , sweet as honey , pour from a gold cup . Old crones mutter curses in dark corners , and blind seers moan ; in Greek-tragedy circles , precognition is no blessing . Loves are twice as strong as life , and so are hates . This is epic country , full of men on the scale of gods and gods " as illogical as sharks . " <P> John Gardner pursues his story with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to imagine human beings as free as the gods . Yet Jason 's betrayal of Medeia must be followed according to the moral geometry of known Greek tragedy . Medeia kills Jason 's bride with a poisoned robe woven from the golden fleece , then slaughters the children she has borne Jason .
