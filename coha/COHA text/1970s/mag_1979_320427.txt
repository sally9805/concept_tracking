It may some day cause another major earthquake <P> It was as frightening a natural cataclysm as had befallen the young nation . Buildings tumbled and forests were destroyed . Giant fissures opened in the ground , accompanied by a thunderous roar and a spreading sulfurous odor . Wrote one eyewitness : " The whole land was moved and waved like waves of the sea . " The usually placid Mississippi became an angry torrent of whirlpools and rapids , overflowing its banks and possibly even briefly reversing course . <P> Three times , between Dec , 16 , 1811 , and Feb. 7 , 1812 , such scenes were repeated as major earthquakes jolted the region around the small Mississippi River town of New Madrid , Mo . Because the region was sparsely inhabited , few lives were lost . Still , the shocks were so powerful that they caused church bells to ring as far away as Charleston , S.C. , stopped pendulum clocks in Washington , D.C. , and shook buildings in New York City . No seismographs existed at the time , but detailed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quakes would have ranged between 7.3 and 7.5 on the Richter scale . By comparison , the big quake that destroyed San Francisco in 1906 was 8.3 , and the 1964 quake in Alaska registered 8.5 . <P> The trio of quakes has another distinction . Most major quakes occur around the boundaries of the great moving plates that form the earth 's outer layers . One such region lies along California 's quake-prone San Andreas fault , where the North American plate and the adjacent Pacific plate are grinding horizontally against each other as they move in opposite directions . When friction causes these plates to stick , stresses build up that are eventually released in a quake when the rock suddenly fractures and the plates lurch ahead . Yet the New Madrid area lies in the very heart of the North American plate , far from its boundaries . Why should it have shaken so violently in the early 1800s and , in fact , continued to quiver occasionally ever since ? <P> Seismologists now believe they have part of the answer . Using oil-exploration equipment , they bounced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ centered . The echoes yielded a surprising profile of this hidden structure . <P> Along a large crack , corresponding layers of rock were offset vertically-in some places by as much as 1,000 meters ( 3,300 ft . ) . In other words , a break had occurred and some of the rock sank . Apparently , at some time in the remote past , the rock had been uplifted-perhaps by volcanism . <P> Then , as the volcanic flows cooled , part of the rock collapsed , creating sharp breaks . Subsequently the breaks were obscured by the soft sediments of the Mississippi River Valley . <P> The U.S. Geological Survey scientists mapped only a small section of this fault zone-in Arkansas ' Mississippi and Craighead counties-but they suspect it continues north for some 100 km ( 62 miles ) , through Arkansas and northwestern Tennessee . There the fault system veers off past New Madrid and probably continues into southern Illinois . In all , the scientists count about half a dozen associated faults , although their data are still sketchy . Says St. Louis University Geophysicist Sean-Thomas Morrissey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finger in the fault like in California . "
