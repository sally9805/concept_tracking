Rome Bureau Chief Wilton Wynn , who traveled with Pope John Paul II through Poland for this week 's cover story , is no stranger to papal tours . He flew twice with Pope Paul VI and had a chat with John Paul II on the new Pontiffs trip to Mexico last January . Wynn reports great differences between the two as air passengers . " Pope Paul established the habit of visiting the press section during each flight , " recalls Wynn . " But he was reserved and a bit shy . He would shake each newsman 's hand , murmur a greeting , and then return to his compartment . " But when John Paul II meets the press , he is outgoing and garrulous . On the flight from Rome to Warsaw , the Pope fielded inquiries in six languages ( English , German , Polish , Spanish , Italian , French ) and managed a brief conversation with Wynn ( in English , though the correspondent also speaks Italian and Arabic ) . " I touched his arm to get his attention , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personal warmth he exudes - John Paul grasped my hand , turned to me and gave me a warm smile as if we were old friends . " <P> Covering the papal newsmaker on the ground proved a bit more challenging ; the Pope went by helicopter to all stops , while reporters had to follow by car . Wynn and Eastern Europe Correspondent Barry Kalb devised a system of " leapfrogging " the papal party . One would spend a day covering the Pope , while the other drove to the next destination and saw to all the complicated logistical and bureaucratic arrangements the trip required . <P> Says Kalb , who joined TIME last December after serving with CBS News in Hong Kong : " I spent the past three years as a China watcher , so I had some idea of how the official Communist mind works . " Kalb was not prepared , however , for the major role that religion plays in Poland . " Here is 1,000 years of almost unbroken living tradition , " he says . " It is easy to see how the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become such a powerful attraction for the Poles . " Wynn and Kalb also found it easy to see why Pope John Paul II has become such a powerful attraction for journalists . Says Wynn : <P> " You never know what he will do next . Almost daily he says or does something you can not ignore . He is a good conversationalist , full of anecdotes and humorous sayings . "
