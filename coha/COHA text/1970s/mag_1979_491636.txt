THE AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF NORMAN ROCKWELL . by Norman Rockwell as told to Thomas Rockwell W hen I was ten years old , a skinny kid with a long neck and narrow shoulders , I wanted to be a weight lifter . So I began a program of exercises to strengthen myself . Every morning I would do pushups , deep knee bends , jumping jacks , and the like before my bedroom mirror . After a month or so , unable to detect any improvement , I gave up . Instead of becoming a weight lifter , I decided to fall back on what seemed to be my only talent  --  drawing . And here I am , 56 years later , still drawing . Every so often , usually when I 'm having trouble with a picture , I spread on my studio floor reproductions of the 306 Post covers I have painted since 1916 , walk around them , and try to decide whether my work has progressed through all those years . If it has n't , I say to myself , I 'm washed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work has improved , because my memories keep intruding . Looking at all those covers , I recall their history : the models I used , the trouble I had getting the original idea , how the public reacted . Everything I have ever seen or done has gone into my pictures in one way or another . The story of my life is really the story of my pictures and how I made them . There was my uncle , Gil Waughlum , for example , a well-to-do elderly gentleman , who in his youth had been something of a scientist and inventor . It was always told with pride in my family that Uncle Gil , in the course of one of his experiments , had flown the great Gil Waughlum kite from a tower on Washington Square in New York . I do n't know what the experiment proved  --  something to do with Benjamin Franklin and electricity , I believe  --  but it was important , for in their day Gil Waughlum and the great Gil Waughlum kite were well known . When I knew him he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pink cheeks and a bald head , he was always giggling and nudging my brother Jarvis and me to make sure we were properly merry . Whenever I think of him , I 'm reminded of Mister Dick , the kindly , gay simpleton who was Betsey Trotwood 's companion in Dickens ' David Copperfield . I do n't mean that Uncle Gil was a simpleton . He was n't . But he had one eccentricity  --  he got holidays mixed up . On Christmas Day , with snow on the ground , Uncle Gil would bring firecrackers to celebrate the // Fourth of July . On Easter he would bring us Christmas gifts ; on Thanksgiving , chocolate rabbits . The next year we had firecrackers on my birthday and chocolate rabbits for Christmas . We never knew what to expect . I always wondered where he got firecrackers in December or Christmas cards in April . But I guess the merchants in Yonkers , his home town , understood his problem . He always sneaked into the house and hid our gifts  --  under pillows , behind the couch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we might have the fun of a treasure hunt . I remember him shouting , " Warm . Norman , warm ! " as I approached a hidden present , and " Hurrah ! " when I found it . In 1936 , when I painted a Post cover of a small boy searching the pockets of his grandfather 's overcoat for a gift , I was really painting Uncle Gil . Of course , I do n't claim to have put on canvas 66 years ' worth of people , places , and events . Rather , I store up things in my mind , and when I need something for a picture  --  a feeling , a character , a wry smile  --  there it is . And I draw it out and paint it . Whenever I want embarrassment , I think of the time I tried , and for several agonizing minutes failed , to lift a 250-pound soprano during a performance at the Metropolitan Opera . For rackety-bang confusion , I recall my early days as an illustrator , when my models were surly dogs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want despair , I remember the time I was swindled out of $10,000 . For chagrin I remember my flops  --  the affair of me and the seven movie stars ; the United Nations picture I could n't bring off . And for a mixture of embarrassment , confusion , despair , and chagrin I recall my dinner at the White House . Come to think of it , that dinner embraces vanity , exuberance , fright , and a wonderful , warm personality . It 's too complex to paint ; it would n't fit inside a frame . It all began one sunny day in May , 1955 , when I received a note from President Eisenhower , inviting me to a stag dinner at the White House . I had painted his portrait in 1952 , but I had never expected an invitation to dinner . Overcome with delight and anxiety , I posted my acceptance and hurried to the attic to dig out my tuxedo . As I pulled it from a steamer trunk , a cloud of moths flew up . The sleeves were tattered , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a local haberdasher for a replacement , I was shown a midnight blue jacket with lapels dropping in a fat , glittering curve to the waist . I thought it looked cheap . " You 're sure it 's fashionable ? " I asked . " Oh , yes , " said the clerk , " Midnight blue , shawl collar  --  that 's the latest . " So , in spite of my misgivings , I bought it . That was n't the end of my preparations . I expected to be nervous , even scared , at the dinner . Suppose my mouth dried up and I was unable to speak ? What then ? I thought . Why , you 'll be ashamed of yourself . ( " Hello , " says the President ? " Gargle , " say I. ) I visited the office of my friend , Dr. Donald Campbell . Could medical science help me ? It could . Doctor Campbell handed me a tranquilizer pill . " Take it 20 minutes before you go to the White House , " he said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Norman . It obliterates apprehension , tension , and dread . " Armed with my pill ( pea green ) and my tuxedo ( midnight blue ) I went to Washington , confident that I was bulwarked against catastrophe . On arriving at my hotel I inquired how long it took to drive to the White House . Then I went to my room and worked out a schedule . At 6:30 , exactly one hour before the dinner , I gave my tuxedo to the valet to press . At 7:00 he brought it back . As I fumbled for a tip , I noticed him looking at the tuxedo queerly . " What 's the matter ? " I asked . " Nothing , sir , nothing , " he said , recovering the blank stare of valets waiting for a tip . " The tux is n't fashionable , is it ? " " Well , sir , " said the valet , " I might say that I have never seen that particular shade of blue before . " When he had left , I stared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tuxedo . Patting the pillbox in my coat pocket , I thought , At least you 've got that ; you may look like a fool , but you 'll feel like Grant at Appomattox . I went into the bathroom , drew a glass of water , and shook the pill out of its box into my hand . It fell on its edge , rolled into the sink , and went down the drain . " In 15 years , " I said out loud , " I'Il laugh at that . " Stunned , I went into the bedroom , put on my extraordinary tux , tied my tie , and went downstairs . As I reached the taxi stand outside the hotel , a battered old cab chugged up , clanking and rattling . At the wheel was a stout , middle-aged woman with a chauffeur 's cap cocked over one eye . The doorman waved her away , but I signaled her to stop , feeling that we two , the cab and I , victims of adversity , should stick together . " The White @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she exploded heartily . " You going to the White House ? Whatta you going to do there ? " " I 'm going to dinner , " I said , cheered by this onslaught of good nature . " Wow ! " she exclaimed . " I 've never taken nobody to the White House before . I 'll get ya there in five minutes flat . " The cab leaped forward with a roar like a wounded rhinoceros . " Wait ! " I said . " I do n't want to be early . We 'd better go to the White House and then drive back and forth in front of it until the dot of 7:30 . " " O.K. , mister , " she said . While we were cruising up and down Pennsylvania Avenue she asked , " What 's your name ? You fa-mous ? " " I do covers for The Saturday Evening Post , " I said . " My name 's Norman Rockwell . " " Are you scared ? " " Yes , " I said , studying my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time .... Now ! " We turned into the White House gate and jolted to a stop . The guards checked my invitation . Continuing up the drive , we waited while a chauffeur helped a gentleman out of a limousine . A crowd of Secret Service men and other functionaries were standing at the entrance . I paid my fare and started up the steps . " Hey , Mr. Rockwell , " boomed a voice behind me . I turned around . The cab driver was waving at me . " Good luck , Mr. Rockwell ! " she shouted . " Good luck ! " The Secret Service men laughed . I waved back . " Thanks , " I called . A secretary ushered me upstairs and into a sitting room . I almost panicked as I crossed the threshold , for all the tuxedoes were black , with dull lapels . A minute later President Eisenhower greeted me warmly , and I felt right at home . Then the President , raising his voice a trifle , explained to all of us that his stag dinners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the press about the dinner . So I will only say that I had a fine , easy time and enjoyed myself very much . After leaving the President , as we were standing on the steps of the White House , we sounded like a bunch of kids discussing the high school football hero . A secretary had told us that our evening had lasted one-half hour longer than any of the President 's other informal evenings . We were delighted and flattered , which shows how President Eisenhower affects people . You just ca n't help liking him . I have one dark confession to make . Before each place at the dinner table was a small jackknife , a gift from the President to each guest . There was no inscription on the knife , however , so I went to a jeweler 's in New York the next day and asked to have " From DDE to NR " engraved on the knife . During the next few months , whenever I took out my knife , always being careful to show the inscription , people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Where 'd you get that knife ? " So I 'd get a chance to describe my evening at the White House . Ah , vanity , vanity , thy name is Norman ! I sometimes wonder why I was so nervous at the prospect of dining at the White House . After all , I 'm no pink-cheeked innocent . Still , I have a rather simple view of life . To me , a President is an awe-inspiring figure . I ca n't be as cool as a clam at the prospect of dining at the White House . And then I have a mercurial temperament . When that pill rolled down the drain , my spirits followed . The same sort of thing happens with my work . When Continued on page 102 Autobiography continued from page 10 the art critics call me " cornball " and my work " kitsch , " which I 'm told is a derogatory term for popular art , I begin to worry . But I always pick up my brushes and go back to work . For better or for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or a modern artist . I 'm an illustrator , which is very different . The modern artist and the fine arts painter have only to satisfy themselves . The illustrator must satisfy his client as well as himself . He must express a specific idea so that everybody will understand it . He must meet deadlines . The proportions of the picture must always fit the proportions of the magazine . Ten or fifteen years ago a Bohemian art student  --  beard , long hair , sandals  --  kept hanging around a studio I had rented in Province-town , Massachusetts . One day he interrupted my work on a painting of Johnny Appleseed  --  an old man with an iron kettle on his head and a burlap sack for a coat , striding across a hilltop , flinging out handfuls of seed . " Whatta ya do it that way for ? " the art student asked . " What do you mean ? " " Why n't ya do it with more feeling ? " he said . " Like this . " He pulled some colored chalk out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big piece of paper . " Now , " he said , filling in with light-brown chalk a shape like a hawk 's beak , " that 's old Johnny 's body . It was browned by the wind and sun . O.K. ? " I nodded , startled . " O.K. , " he said , and above the hawk 's beak , which projected from the lower right corner , he divided the rectangle into a red area and a white area , each roughly triangular . " He was kind of a religious fanatic , " he said . " Right ? " I nodded dumbly . " So the white 's his spirit , " he said , " and the red 's the physical part of him , and they 're contending , the physical and the spiritual . " He rubbed blue chalk over the area below the hawk 's beak ? " That 's nature . " ? made the base of the rectangle dark brown ? " That 's earth . " ? and drew a hand casting a seed , the arm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I said when he 'd finished , " nobody knows it 's Johnny Appleseed . Only you know it 's Johnny Appleseed . Nobody else can tell who it is . " " So ? What difference does it make about anybody else ? I know it 's old Johnny . I 'm painting it for myself . Who cares about the unwashed masses ? " " Besides , " I said , " your picture wo n't fit into the book it 's supposed to appear in . The proportions are wrong . You 've got it too tall . " " So make the book tall , " he said . All of which demonstrates , I think , that a modern artist or fine arts painter does n't go at a picture the same way an illustrator does . I believe strongly that a painting should communicate something to large numbers of people . So , according to some critics , my work is old-fashioned , trite , banal . This criticism worries me now and then , especially when a picture I 'm trying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ca n't change . I 'm not a modern artist and never will be . I do n't see things the way modernists do , even though I enjoy studying their work . I 've been an illustrator since I was 16 years old . I 'm not particularly satisfied with my work  --  at least I 'm always trying to improve it  --  but I believe in it . It 's not that painting Post covers is easy . I have n't been doing it for 43 years just because it was the simplest way to earn a living . It 's been darned difficult at times . Once I could n't finish a picture for six months ; I almost went under that time . And there is a recurring crisis when I seek Post cover ideas . During my first years as an illustrator , when I 'd sit down in the evening to think up a batch of new ideas I 'd feel all washed out , blank , nothing in my head but a low buzzing noise . I 'd stare at the wall and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and crumpling up sheets of paper for hours , I said to myself , This has got to stop ; I ca n't sit here and muse all day . So I figured out a system and used it for 20 years or so . When I had run out of ideas , I 'd eat a light meal , sharpen 20 pencils , and lay out a dozen pads of paper on the dining room table . Then I 'd draw a lamppost ( after a while I got to be the best lamppost artist in America ) . Then I 'd draw a drunken sailor leaning on the lamppost . I 'd think about the sailor . Did his girl marry someone else while he was at sea ? He 's stranded in a foreign port without money ? No . I 'd think of the sailor patching his clothes on shipboard . That would remind me of a mother darning her little boy 's pants . Welt , what did she find in the pocket ? A top . A knife handle . A turtle  --  I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would make me think of a kid going to school . No , it 's been done . How about the kid in school ? Of course , he hates school . Gazes out the window at his dog . I 'd sketch that . The dog runs after a cat . Cat climbs a tree . Dog ambles about , looking for trouble . Sees an old bum stealing a pie from a kitchen window . Dog latches onto the seat of his pants . I 'd sketch that . Bum escapes . Eats the pie . Sheriff collars bum . I 'd sketch that . Bum to jail . ... I 'd keep this up for three or four hours , the rough drawings piling up on the floor . Then , worn out , I 'd ar ? rive at the absolute conviction that I was dried up , through , finished . So I 'd go to bed , completely discouraged . The next morning I 'd be desperate . After pawing at my breakfast eggs for a few minutes , I 'd push them away and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to do ? No ideas . I 'd kick my trash bucket and suddenly , as it rolled bumpety-bump across the floor , an idea would come to me like a flash of lightning . I 'd given my brain such a beating the night before that it was in a sensitive state . Pretty soon I 'd have a Post cover . Nowadays I do n't think up ideas in exactly the same way , but the process is just as nerve-racking . You 'd think that by this time I would have thought up a simple , efficient system , but I have n't . A good idea for a Post cover is hard to come by . I have to work for it . But a picture is worth any amount of bother . I cling to this belief in spite of the trouble it 's got me into . Further on I 'll tell about how I bought almost all the old clothes in Hannibal , Missouri , because of it . And why I 'd be embarrassed if I met Stan Musial , Van Johnson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's a marvel to me the situations I 've got into and out of during my life . When I was 15 years old , I taught French and athletics at a private school , though I could n't speak a word of French or play a slow game of tiddlywinks . Later on , my life was complicated by impostors who committed practical jokes  --  even swindles  --  in my name . Compounding confusion , my name is sometimes mistaken for that of Rockwell Kent , the noted artist , writer , and left wing sympathizer . But all these stories are for later telling . Right now , I guess , I 'd better begin at the beginning . I was born on February 3 , 1894 , in a shabby brownstone-front house on 103rd Street and Amsterdam Avenue in New York City . My mother was an Anglophile  --  I wore a black arm band for six weeks after Queen Victoria died  --  and she named me after Sir Norman Perceval , an English ancestor who reputedly kicked Guy Fawkes down the stairs of the Tower of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Lords . The line from Sir Norman to me is tortuous but unbroken , and my mother insisted that I always sign my name Norman Perceval Rockwell . " You have a valiant heritage , " she said . " Never allow anyone to intimidate you or make you feel the least bit inferior . There has never been a tradesman in your family . You are descended from artists and gentlemen . " But I had the notion that Perceval was a sissy name . I darn near died when a boy called me " Mercy Percy " ; to my relief , the name did n't stick . When I left home I dropped the Perceval immediately , despite my mother 's protestations . My family moved to an apartment on 147th Street and St. Nicholas Avenue when I was two years old . It was narrow and gloomy , with few windows . My father had to carry coal for our two stoves up four flights from the basement . But the flat was uptown from 103rd Street and , in those days , that meant we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ genteel neighborhood  --  a few private houses , but mostly four- or five-story apartment houses ; a grocery store or saloon on every corner ; here and there a vacant lot strewn with bottles and cans . It was n't a slum neighborhood ; just lower middle class , with a smattering of poorer families . When I was six or seven my father 's mother died , and we moved in with my grandfather , who lived in an apartment at 152nd Street and St. Nicholas Avenue . Again we had taken a step up . There were two small elm trees in front of our house , and our apartment had a mock fireplace with a plaster mantelpiece . There was a lot of racial and social prejudice in New York City in those days . Children felt it . Boys whose families could afford to live in private houses looked down on those who rented . Sons of white-collar workers disdained boys whose fathers worked with their hands . I remember one boy , Ewald E. Swenson , whose mother took in washing . That put him below @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew it . One day his uncle , a drunkard , dropped dead in the street . When the police arrived in the pie wagon to take the body away , a lot of us boys were gathered around . The policeman asked who the dead man was . We pushed Ewald to the front . " It 's Ewald 's uncle , " we said . " Well , " said the policeman , " come on , the whole bunch of you , get in the wagon . Ewald there will have to identify the body down at the station . " We grabbed Ewald , who was almost paralyzed with fright , and piled into the patrol wagon . We were heroes for a week . From then on Ewald was an honored member of our gang . We even initiated him into our secret society , the Jamel Athletic Club . He signed his name in blood and swore eternal secrecy . The J.A.C . was devoted to knowledge . We read the Rover Boys and Horatio Alger , even G. A. Henty , who was considered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Based on Historical Fact , " on the title pages of his books . We made expeditions along the Hudson River . Sometimes we went over to Amsterdam Avenue to look under the swinging doors of saloons ; it gave us a thrill to see the feet of the men standing at the bar . We dug holes to China in vacant lots and , kneeling down , one ear pressed to the bottom of the hole , listened intently . " D' ya hear anything ? " " Yeah , yeah , I hear something . Quiet ! " ( Breathless silence ) " Whatta ya hear ? " " Voices . They 're talking Chinese ; I ca n't understand them . " We boasted about our families . I was thought to be tops in culture because my family had two Caruso records . We climbed telegraph poles , played prisoners ' base , sat on the stoops of our houses in the evening watching the lamplighter climb his ladder and light the gas lamps . I guess we led the average life of city kids around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my parents , I recall a scene which was repeated day after day during my childhood . It is late afternoon , and I am playing on the stairs of the apartment house . My father comes up the stairs , tired by his day at the office and his hour 's ride home on Continued on page 130 Autobiography continued from page 103 the trolley . He goes into the apartment , and I hear him say to my mother , " Well , now , Nancy , how are you ? " She would reply , " Oh , Waring , I 've had such a hard day , I 'm just worn out . " " Now , Nancy , " my father would say , " you lie down on the couch there , and I 'll get a cold towel for your head . " Then I could hear my mother complaining , interrupted at long intervals by my father speaking in tones of gentle sympathy . " Your father 's a saint ! " the neighbors used to tell me . " He 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after he married my mother , a small , pretty woman , she fell ill . That was the beginning of a long series of illnesses continuing through her whole life  --  she lived to be 85 years old . The doctors often said there was nothing wrong with her . I think she felt that my father was lowering himself when he married her , the daughter of a wild , impoverished artist . When I was a child she would call me into her bedroom and say , " Norman Perceval , you must always honor and love your mother . She needs you . " Somehow that put a barrier between us . My father was a very handsome man . There was something aristocratic about his fine dark eyes , his neatly trimmed mustache , the way he carried himself . He wore dark , well-tailored suits and never removed his coat in the presence of ladies . He did not drink but was a gentlemanly smoker . Dignified , gentle but distant , aware of Jarvis and me , always treating us as grown-up sons even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my father . I was never close to him . He worked all his life for George Wood , Sons and Company , a textile firm , rising from office boy to manager of the New York office . He was intensely loyal to the firm . Every so often he would come home from the office beaming with pleasure , a sure sign that Mr. Wood had been in the office and spoken to him . At dinner Jarvis and I would beg him to tell us what Mr. Wood had said , and he would repeat the conversation verbatim . My parents were very religious . Jarvis and I were n't allowed to play with our toys or read the funny papers on Sunday . I was a choirboy , first at St. Luke 's , and then at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine . At the Cathedral we sang four services every Sunday . There were rehearsals three afternoons a week after school and again on Friday evenings . I did n't enjoy it much ; it was hard work . After the Spanish-American War many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the congregation were drilled by some church member who had had military training . On holidays we marched in parades , dressed in copies of Spanish-American War uniforms and carrying wooden guns . I was the smallest boy in the St. Luke 's Battalion and marched alone in the rear  --  my father used to call me " the High Private in the Rear Rank . " Sometimes I 'd be strutting along trying to hold myself ramrod straight , eyes front , and the motorman of the trolley following the parade would bring his car quietly up behind me , then clang the bell and nudge me with the cowcatcher  --  to the great detriment of my military bearing . On Sundays , if my mother was too ill to go to church , we would sing hymns in the parlor . On weekday evenings , after Jarvis and I had finished our homework , we sat around the dining room table while my father read Dickens aloud . I drew pictures of the different characters as I imagined them  --  Mr. Pickwick , Oliver Twist , Uriah Heep . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moved by Dickens . I suffered with Little Dorritt in the Marshalsea Prison , had nightmares over Bill Sikesand Fagin , felt ennobled by Sidney Carton : " It is a far , far better thing that I do .... " The variety of life in Dickens  --  its sadness , horror , happiness , treachery , the sharp impressions of dirt , food , inns , horses  --  shocked and delighted me . So that , I thought , is what the world is really like . Two memories of the city overshadow all else , unfairly perhaps . One is of the night President McKinley was shot . I remember the streets were dark except for the yellow pools of light beneath the gas lamps . The newsboys were shouting , " Extra ! Extra ! Extra ! McKinley assassinated ! Extra ! Extra ! " People were gathering under the gas lamps , reading the news and brushing off their faces the moths that swarmed about the light . There was a kind of horror in the streets . Because I did not understand the meaning of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mortally wounded in some cruel , torturing way . I was only seven at the time . The next day we went to church , where they played " Nearer , My God , to Thee , " McKinley 's favorite hymn . My father and mother cried . The other memory is of a vacant lot in the cold , yellow light of late afternoon and a drunken woman in filthy rags beating a man over the head with an umbrella until he fell , then standing over him , kicking and striking him again and again . We kids watched from the edge of the lot until a policeman ran up and grabbed the woman . The man got up slowly and , seeing the policeman struggling with the woman , attacked him , swaying drunkenly and swearing . I forget how it ended . But the memory of that night and of that drunken woman became my image of the city . Against this image of the city  --  distorted as it is , I have never been able to rid myself of it entirely  --  I set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old , my family spent every summer in the country at various farms which took in boarders . The grownups played croquet , or sat in high slat-backed rockers on the front porch . We kids were left to do just about anything we wanted . We helped with the milking , fished , swam , trapped birds , cats , turtles , and snakes , smoked corn silk behind the barn , fell off horses and out of lofts  --  did everything , in fact , that country boys do , except complain about the drudgery and boredom of farm life . Those summers , as I look back on Continued on page 134 Autobiography continued from page 130 them now , more than 50 years later , have become a collection of random impressions outside of time , not connected with a specific place or event , and all together forming an image of sheer bliss . I remember throwing off my shoes and socks to wiggle my bare toes in the cool green grass on our first day in the country , then running off gingerly over gravel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I remember the hayrides , all the boarders singing as the horses trotted along the dark country lanes ; the excitement of eating lunch with the threshing crew at long board tables ; hunting bullfrogs with a scrap of red silk tied to the end of a pole ; the turtles and frogs we carried back to the city in the fall , snuffling and crying on the train because summer was over . During the summer I lived an idealized version of the life of a farmboy in the late nineteenth century , and my memories of those days had a lot to do with what I painted later on . Every artist has his own way of looking at life , and this view affects the treatment of his subject matter . Coles Phillips and I used to use the same girl as a model . She was attractive , almost beautiful . In his paintings Coles Phillips made her sexy , sophisticated , and wickedly beautiful . When I painted her , she became a nice , sensible girl , wholesome and rather drab . This view @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ugly . I paint life as I would like it to be . Somebody once said that I paint the kind of girls your mother would want you to marry . In 1951 , for the Thanksgiving issue of the Post , I painted a cover showing an old woman and a small boy saying grace in a shabby railroad restaurant . The people around them were staring , some surprised , some puzzled , some remembering their own childhood ; but all were respectful . If you actually saw such a scene , some of the staring people would have been indifferent , some insulting and rude , and perhaps a few would have been angry . But I did n't see it that way . I just naturally made the people respectful . Frederic Remington painted the romantic , glamorous aspects of the West  --  cowboys sitting around a campfire , an attack on a stagecoach . Any old-timer can tell you that life in the wild Westwas often dull . But Remington , who was born and reared in upstate New York , did n't find drudgery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ missed the dullness of farm life . I doubt that I would have idealized the country if I had grown up as a farmboy . Maybe as I grew up and found that the world was n't the perfectly pleasant place I had thought it to be , I unconsciously decided to compensate . So I painted only the ideal aspects of life  --  pictures in which there were no drunken slatterns or self-centered mothers , in which , on the contrary , foxy grandpas played baseball with the kids and boys got up circuses in the back yard . If there were problems in this created world of mine , they were humorous problems . The people in my pictures are n't mentally ill or deformed . The situations they get into are commonplace , everyday situations , not the agonizing crises and tangles of life . The summers I spent in the country as a child became part of this idealized view of life . Of course , country people fit into my kind of picture better than city people . Their faces are more open and expressive , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a bad case of the American nostalgia for the clean , simple country life , as opposed to the complicated world of a city . Then , I have other motives for painting as I do . For one thing , I have always wanted everybody to like my work , so I have painted pictures that I knew everyone would understand and like . Icould never be satisfied with the approval of the critics ; and , boy , I 've certainly had to be satisfied without it . T  --  I ' ,
