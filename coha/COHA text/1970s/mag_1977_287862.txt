President Jimmy Carter discussed his foreign policy with TIME Managing Editor Henry Grunwald , Washington Bureau Chief Hugh Sidey , White House Correspondent Stanley Cloud , Diplomatic Correspondent Strobe Talbott and State Department Correspondent Chris Ogden . Excerpts from the interview : <P> <P> Q .. The principles you have enunciated for a Middle East settlement are clearly not accepted by Israel . Why , then , do we press so hard for a Geneva conference ? Is n't it very likely that , if it convenes , it will break down ? <P> <P> A. That is certainly always a likelihood . It would be a mistake to assume that the Geneva conference is going to be easy or brief . But it will be the first opportunity , if it materializes , for the Arab leaders and the Israeli leaders to meet together hi extensive negotiations to understand one another 's approach , positions , attitudes , and to marshal the opinion of the world on the points in dispute . <P> I think if a particular leader of one of the countries should find that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the other parties involved , including ourselves and the Soviet Union , and was a narrowly defined question in his own country , there would be a great impetus on that leader to conform with the overwhelming opinion . <P> No one can guarantee success . It is a problem that has been extant for 29 years or more-some say thousands of years . But I think it is a good first step and I think that anyone who would only go with a guarantee of success would probably not likely take the first step toward peace . <P> <P> Q. If the conference breaks up in animosity and anger , would n't that increase the danger of war ? <P> <P> A. That is a possibility . My genuine belief is that all the leaders want peace . They all have a publicly expressed position of flexibility that all items are negotiable . This is our best hope in many years . <P> <P> Q. If the Israeli position at Geneva should be quite different from yours , would you find some means of persuasion or pressure ? <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say that our own positions that have been spelled out in general terms deliberately are the ones we still espouse . They have n't been completely accepted by the Israelis nor the Arab leaders , of course , and we ca n't say yet that they are completely endorsed by the Soviets either . I think there has been a general acceptance of the proposition that the step-by-step incremental approach is too long , too tedious and leaves unhealed wounds . I think there is a general acceptance of the proposition that we ought to have a comprehensive settlement , based on peace treaties with all the Arab nations and the Israelis being involved together . I ca n't anticipate now what our position would be . I would try to marshal the support of the leader , first of all . Secondly , the opinion of his people back home , the constituencies that might exist in our own country that would have influence around the world , opinion that exists in the European Community , and in the Arab nations as well . <P> <P> Q. Did Mr. Begin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ P.L.O . participation in the Geneva conference if the P.L.O . were to accept the principle of the existence of Israel ? <P>
