These are not the best of times for President Nguyen Van Thieu . Since the 1973 Peace Accords were signed in Paris , the opposing sides in South Viet Nam have methodically killed each other at a doleful rate of 4,000 a month . What makes the fighting utterly futile is the fact that neither the Communists nor the Saigon government has scored any strategic gains . Moreover , public discontent with Thieu 's tautly run regime has been fueled by inflation , which is currently running at a staggering 70% a year . As a result , Thieu , for the first time since the ceasefire , now faces a disparate but potentially volatile opposition from militant Roman Catholics and Buddhists , as well as from the normally docile Saigon press . <P> Land Deals . The opposition first surfaced a fortnight ago in the shattered former imperial capital of Hue , where 5,000 civilians gathered in front of the city 's Roman Catholic cathedral to protest government corruption . The complaint was familiar enough , but the specifics were startlingly new . In a document that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had profited handsomely from housing and land deals , that his wife Nguyen Thi Mai had taken a rake-off from running a hospital that admits mostly well-to-do patients , and that his brother-in-law Nguyen Xuan Nguyen had made hundreds of millions of piasters in fertilizer speculation . <P> The priests also accused the mother of freewheeling Information Minister Hoang Due Nha , 32 , a cousin of the President 's and his closest confidant , of profiteering in sales of subsidized rice in the largely barren central coast . Police roughed up some of the Hue demonstrators , but to avoid triggering trouble elsewhere , they dispersed the crowd peacefully . <P> Next a group of editors and publishers met in Saigon to protest the press code that has long muzzled South Vietnamese newspapers and magazines . After a long series of unproductive meetings with Information Minister Nha , the editors announced that they would henceforth ignore government restrictions . When three Saigon newspapers published the full text of the Catholic priests ' charges against Thieu and his family , about 60 Catholics , Buddhists and journalists marched to prevent police @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 10,000 copies of an edition the police had ordered confiscated while a crowd shouted , " Down with dictatorship and corruption ! " Such public displays would have been unthinkable only a few months ago . <P> Although Buddhist immolations in 1963 roused American opinion against Ngo Dinh Diem and in 1966 forced Thieu to promise elections , until recently the Buddhists had limited their anti-Thieu protests to pathetic little marches in downtown Saigon , in which they were outnumbered 10 to 1 by police . They have now formed an organization called the Forces for National Reconciliation . The Buddhists carefully refrained from labeling the " force " a political party in order to avoid legal harassment , but they clearly intend to exert renewed political influence . Says Senator Vu Van Mau , leader of a Buddhist group in the Thieu-dominated Senate : " I think in a democracy-and Thieu claims that this is a democracy-that he must take account of the opinion of the people . He must explain himself . "                 @ @ @ @
