Women 's Issue <P> Sir / Re " The American Woman " March 20 : congratulations ! You have stated our case with realism , legitimacy , statistics , and sanity . <P> <P> GAIL BASKIN <P> Cincinnati <P> Sir / Some of the women , all of the TIME . All of the women , some of the TIME . <P> Please never again all of the women , all of the TIME . <P> <P> JEANNE MCNALLY <P> La Jolla , Calif . Sir ( or Ms. ) / Female chauvinist pigs ! ! <P> <P> JOHN F. MCGRATH <P> Boulder , Colo . <P> <P> Sir / Your issue on Women 's Lib should be used as a bible by those who are trying to correct inequalities to women . Publicity for Women 's Lib has been unfair . Through frivolous publicity , emphasis has been placed on silly demands which completely obscure the real and serious issues . <P> <P> EDWARD LYSEK <P> Chicopee , Mass . <P> <P> Sir / I found your issue of March 20 from start to finish an absolute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , N.Y . <P> <P> Women 's Gallery <P> Sir / " A Gallery of American Women " tells the success stories of eight white women and the failure story of one black woman . What was the point ? To show us that white women can successfully cope and black women can not ? There are thousands of black women who are success stories , and thousands who are coping successfully ( yes , even some on welfare ) . <P> I am a black woman who usually gives you high marks for integrity and fair play , but this time your insensitivity to Betty Jackson , and black women in general , is showing . <P> <P> ROSETTA B.

I worked seven years before I was married ( I was the first industrial diamond-powder saleswoman in the U.S. ) and dreamed of a time when I would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ academic subjects , painting , photography , poetry writing , reading , tennis . <P> In 25 years of marriage , constant examination and evaluation of my husband 's life ( he is an advertising man ) has not led me to believe that his life is more satisfying than mine . His days are long and arduous , stressful , hectic , immensely tiring and relatively confined to one track . By contrast , I have been free to pursue my college career to graduation , become a published writer , a portrait photographer , a reasonably accomplished painter , and even a mediocre tennis player . No one in our house has ever been a slave , least of all me . <P> <P> MRS . IRVING A. PINSKY <P> Los Angeles <P> Sir / I have a question for Gloria Steinem : How many times in her job has she felt frustrated ? Although I am now a full-time housewife , less than a year ago I was a working wife . I had one of nursing 's " glamour " jobs in the intensivecare unit of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Yet at times I felt another disaster would make me leave . <P> The purpose of this letter is just to inform the housewives who wonder what it would be like to hold down a full-time job that although the grass may seem greener , there is just as much frustration and monotony at times . <P> <P> EILEEN M.
