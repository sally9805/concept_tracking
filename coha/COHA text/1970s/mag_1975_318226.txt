Hong Kong 's traditions of complete laissez-faire and growth without ruinous inflation have given it a reputation as one of the world 's most lucrative-and safest-havens for investment . Now that reputation is being tarnished : for the first time in memory , one of the colony 's fabled hongs ( trading companies ) is struggling to avert financial collapse . The endangered hong is Hutchison International , Ltd. , a conglomerate with a labyrinthine network of more than 350 subsidiaries and affiliates , including diamond merchants , earth movers , fashion boutiques and a mailorder business that deals in food , fowl and live animals . <P> Hutchison was built in taipan ( big boss ) style by Sir Douglas Clague , a 59-year-old Rhodesia-born Englishman . Under his aegis the company boosted profits from $3 million in 1969 to $27 million in 1973 , mainly by buying up other companies at a headlong pace . To pay for them , it floated no fewer than ten stock issues in three years , ballooning the number of shares outstanding from 13 million in 1971 to 269 million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ December , however , a crash on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange and declining confidence in Hutchison wiped out nearly 90% of the value of those shares . Clague was unable to continue tapping the stock market for capital . <P> Hutchison 's woes were further aggravated by the recession-a slump in exports depressed its revenues-and by its inability to manage its subsidiaries . The firm 's principal lender , the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corp. , began to apply gentlemanly persuasion to straighten Hutchison out . In August the bank agreed to pump $30 million into the company in return for 150 million newly created shares of its stock-on condition that Clague give way to a bank-picked successor . That ultimatum prompted Clague to make a last-ditch effort to raise capital from European banks . He failed . <P> <P> Defeated , Clague last month moved out of his plush offices at the 24-story Hutchison House on Hong Kong 's waterfront . His bank-picked successor is Conglomerate Rescue Artist William Wyllie ; a four-man caretaker team , in consultation with Wyllie , has moved to sell off some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peddled an 18% interest in a British investment firm . Company insiders expect that a commercial helicopter subsidiary may be sold off or folded , while management control of a merchant banking affiliate will be divested . Hutchison has also been selling off shares of other companies from its investment portfolio at a feverish pace , so confusing its books that accountants can not even produce a sales estimate for 1974 . Wyllie , a 43-year-old Australia-born millionaire with a reputation as a cost cutter , will not formally take over Hutchison 's management until Nov. 1 . But he has already seen enough to conclude that " there probably are n't 50 subsidiaries that are worth a damn . " <P> Hutchison 's designated savior rejects any suggestion that the root cause of the company 's trouble is Hong Kong 's freewheeling atmosphere . Says Wyllie : " Hong Kong is still a place where you can make money freely and legitimately and , what 's more , you can keep it . " As for Hutchison , he adds : " Once we have stopped to take a breath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a drastically shrunken base .
