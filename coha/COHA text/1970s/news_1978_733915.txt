txt The Rev. Jim Jones , who died with more than 900 followers in Guyana on Nov. 18 , lefty network of secret bank accounts around the world totaling more than $10 million , according to former aides . With his death , a mysterious international battle has ; begun for the fortune amassed by the People 's Temple . According to his former associates , Mr. Jones had established at least six and possibly a dozen or more accounts in Switzerland , Panama and other countries , using anonymous numbered accounts Ind dummy corporations to conceal their ownership . One former official of the cult said the total amount of the fortune might be as much as $15 million . Timothy Stoen , a San . Francisco lawyer who was once a Jones aide and legal adviser , developed the plan for the international network of secret bank accounts before he defected from the People 's Temple . A Possible Gift to P.L.O . Mr. Stoen said that Mr. Jones had spoken of channeling the money to the Palestine Liberation Organization , the umbrella grouping of Palestinian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might have ordered this in the final hours of his life . Another former aide said that the charismatic leader , a Marxist and once a San Francisco city official , had mentioned giving the money as a gift to the Soviet Union if he should die . Meinlers of a group of survivors of the Guyana killings said that after the deaths they were on their way to the Soviet Embassy . in Georgetown , the Guyanese capital , with $500,000 in cash , but abandoned the money in the jungle . It was too heavy to carry , they said . Two women ? one of whom may be dead  --  appear to have the answers regarding ' the Jones bank accounts . The women , Carolyn Layton and Terri Buford , both in their late 20 's , were graduates of the University of California and close financial advisers to Mr. Jones . Miss Layton was one of Mr. Jones 's mistresses and his chief administrator on money matters immediately before his death . Witneses reported that they saw her shortly before the killings and sucides at Jonestown. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but her death has not been confirmed . Reliable sources in the cult said that she had been assigned by Mr. Jones to shoot him if the anticipated suicides were ever carried out . Mrs. Buford managed the People 's Temple accounts until she defected from the cult last month . Although Mrs. Buford 's exact whereabouts is not known , there are indications that she was residing recently in so-called safe-houses selected by Mark Lane , the cult 's attorney . Says Lane Mentioned S3 Million Mr. Lane and Charles Garry , a San Francisco lawyer for the People 's Temple , were in Guyana when Representative Leo .1 . Ryan , Democrat of California . led a delegation to Guyana , in northern South America , to investigate the Jones commune . It was that visit that precipitated the killings and suicides . After Mr. Garry and Mr. Lane , fearing for their lives , fled into the jungle , Mr. Garry said in an interview , Mr. Lane told him that there was $3 million in People 's Temple money in Guyana . Mr. Garry quoted Mr. Lane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once controlled that money and other People 's Temple assets . The San Franciscan said the woman had decided to defect and had turned to him for help . Mr. Garry would not identify the woman , but other sources close to the case identified her as Miss Buford . F.B.I . Looking Into Acccounts The Federal Bureau of Investigation , as part of its inquiry into the death of Representative Ryan , is seeking to identify the cult 's bank accounts and determine if any Federal laws were broken in the transactions . Once the accounts are located and catalogued , the ownership of the money ? if , by that time , the money is still in the ' accounts ? must be established . According to other former Jones aides , young female members of the cult played the principal role in the complex scheme of international banking . They were assigned to open dummy overseas bank accounts in several countries ; they would then be sent on hastily arranged trips to deposit or transfer money from the accounts . Several accounts were established in Switzerland and Panama @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman who had taken such a trip had this to say : " We 'd walk into these banks in Switzerland , three kids , all girls about 25 , and sit down and start talking about all these millions of dollars , and the men would n't know what to do . " I remember one man in Zurich looked at us funny , and asked if we were part of a women 's liberation group . He thought we were saving money for some liberation group . " She said that one account was established in Switzerland last year , exclusively for Mr. Jones 's personal use , and under the name of a dummy corporation , " Bridget . " The initial deposit , she said , was $1.5 million . Another account was said to have been opened in Panama by a corporation that included the word " Angelique " in its name . The cult got all that money through collection-plate offerings , the sale of members ' homes and other properties , members ' Social Security checks totaling more than $60,000 a month , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his followers . A woman involved with the accounting records of the People 's Temple said that the organization 's income averaged at least $250,000 a month last year , while she had access to the records . Millions of dollars of the assets were from the sale of homes and properties of members who moved to Guyana or remained in People 's Temples in San Francisco , Los Angeles or in Mendocino County , north of San Francisco . Contenders for the Prize There are already several contenders for the cult 's fortune . Members of the People 's Temple in San Francisco who did not go with others to Guyana have said they intend to keep their temple in operation , and have argued that any assets belong to the congregations . But since the accounts are not in the name of the cult itself , legal sources here have pointed out that their claim might encounter problems . Other claims are expected from the families of people whose homes and other property was extorted from them by the cult , and several lawsuits , seeking the money , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legal adviser , said that he developed the concept of concealment of the organization 's mounting revenues after Mr. Jones told him : " Tim , set up a scheme whereby we can get our assets protected , and do it in a legitimate way . " Mr. Steen said that he studied banking laws in a number of countries and developed a plan that Mr. Jones adopted : A branch temple would be established as a corporation in a foreign country ? " say Luxembourg , " Mr. Steen said ? and the money would then be sent on the bank 's wire to the corporations in an " aboveboard operation . Mr. Steen said that he had advised the cult leader to be sure that he apointed only trustworthy and loyal directors . He also suggested , the lawyer said , that he establish " bearer stock corporations " and keep the stock himself in Nassau. the Bahamas . to keep ultimate control of the money . He said he had told Mr. Jones that it was necessary that all the signatories of the accounts be individuals " who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jones cult , Mr. Steen said , finding obedient people was not difficult : " He was really very good at keeping females in line . " Mr. Steen added that the accounts were set up so that there would be no direct link to Mr. Jones , among other reasons to avoid possible prosecution for evasion of income taxes . The young women selected as his emissaries , he said , had no income of their own and therefore did not need to file any tax returns . Moves to Soviet or Cuba Hinted A former aide said that Mr. Jones had hoped to move his commune Guyana to the Soviet Union or Cuba if he was ever forced out of Guyana . " He wanted to open an orthodox church in Russia so he could keep the money , " that aide said . Only three young women in Jones 's inner circle were assigned to do the banking . In an interview , one of the three explained how the system worked : " We never knew where we were going ; Terri would say that we would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go , and then we 'd just go to the airport and leave . Usually , it was Panama or Switzerland . Before we 'd leave , each of us would get $5,000 . " Once , before Mrs. Buford left San Francisco for to Guyana , the young woman said , " Terri told us we 'd have to I pack for a month , and we were supposed to pack for hot and cold weather , " and she and another young woman did so . " We flew to Panama and stayed in the best hotel , " the woman went on . " Terri was gone all day and said she had to turn over some money to a Swiss bank . We were there about a week . Then we flew to England for two days , then to France . And then we went into Zurich . " We were sitting at the bank and the man said something about a $2 million deposit , and Terri got very annoyed , saying he should n't have said anything . He mentioned two account numbers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did ? they were 747 and 748 . " After that , she said that she and her friend returned to San Francisco while Miss Buford went to Rumania to do more banking . The woman , who discussed the banking operation only under an agreement that her name not be made public , said that she had been required to sign dozens of blank pieces of paper and banking forms . It was assumed that these would be used later to withdraw or transfer money . She also admitted that she had once forged the name of one of the other women cleared for the bank transaction . This young woman said that Mrs. Layton , the former wife of Laurence Layton , who is being held in Guyana in connection with the attack on Representative Ryan and his party , appeared to be the most important figure in the banking operations . Spending in Event of Suicides " The rule was , " the young woman said , " that if Carol Layton came forth with the signatures of two of the three people approved for the account @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time to time , she continued . there were discussions of how the money would be spent if a mass suicide was ever carried out . Among other things , she said that Mr. Jones had once discussed giving some of the money to Angela Davis , the black militant leader , or Dennis Banks , the American Indian Movement leader . Mr. Jones had expressed support for both of them from his pulpit . On another occasion , the young woman said , a fellow assistant to Mr. Jones emerged from a meeting with him with a puzzled expression on her face . Mr. Jones , she was told , had proposed giving the money to the Soviet Union by flying over the country and dropping it from a plane . " She wondered how we would get a plane to do it , " the interviewee said .
