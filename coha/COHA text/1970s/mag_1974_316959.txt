" Nothing delights me so much , " Nelson Rockefeller told the House Judiciary Committee , " as facing up to a complex public issue , with all its confusions , turmoil and intensity , and trying to pull together the human resources to deal with it . " That pleasure was put to the test last week , as Rockefeller withstood the most intense interrogation of his career , covering almost every possible substantive issue and personal idiosyncrasy . Fresh from its impeachment triumph , the committee was plainly determined to outdo its Senate counterpart , the Rules Committee , in dissecting the Rockefeller persona and finding out what makes it tick . Rockefeller , on the other hand , was no less concerned with clearing his name of any hint of scandal or conflict of interest . It was a rigorous confrontation of intellect and ideology in which , in a way , both sides emerged as winners . <P> Since the Senate Rules Committee had scoured the affair of the Goldberg book and the various loans to associates , the Judiciary Committee focused on larger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capacity to respond . The committee 's concern was , fundamentally , the possibility of unceasing conflict of interest if Rockefeller should become President . With a kind of waspish persistence that the Senators had not employed , Democrat Don Edwards wanted to know how Rocky could not avoid making decisions that would affect his own or his family 's holdings . <P> Taxing Oil . There would be conflict in an 8 a.m. decision on banks , suggested Edwards , a 9 a.m. decision on oil , a 10 a.m. decision on airlines , an 11 a.m. decision on communications and a noon decision on insurance . Replied Rockefeller : " I think that 's absurd . The decisions you refer to affect the American people . They do n't affect the Rockefeller family . " Throughout , he was at pains to separate his family 's wealth from the actual management of companies . " I have not followed the management of the companies I invest in . They are investments for investment , not for control . " Though his family has heavy investments in oil stocks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tax on oil companies . <P> Continuing the attack , Edwards cited a study indicating that in recent years representatives of the Rockefeller family have sat on the boards of almost 100 corporations with assets of some $70 billion . Rocky replied that such a figure is " totally misleading . " Ever since President Theodore Roosevelt broke up the Standard Oil monopoly , he said , the Rockefellers have exercised only marginal control over the oil industry . Family influence hardly compares with that of other groups . " The three major American insurance companies invest $156 million a week . The pension funds of the country invest $200 million a week . The Arabs in a week are accumulating more money than my family has after three generations of work . "
