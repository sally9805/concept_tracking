The achievement of a negotiated settlement in the Viet Nam War is a personal triumph for Henry Kissinger , the most brilliant and fascinating figure in the Nixon Administration . An avid Kissinger watcher ever since their days at Harvard , TIME Diplomatic Editor Jerrold Schecter offers the following assessment : <P> <P> HENRY KISSINGER is back on top now , his darkest days behind him . They occurred just after his celebrated comment in October that " peace is at hand .

If peace develops , he may go to Hanoi in the spring to discuss postwar reconstruction . <P> Kissinger 's skill has been in keeping his options open and never providing an exact account of where he stood on an issue . He plays the press and the calculated news leak with great ability , usually to serve his current negotiating or power needs . He strives to maintain his credibility with the Eastern establishment even while serving Nixon . Thus , when asked to explain the effect of the December B-52 bombing upon
