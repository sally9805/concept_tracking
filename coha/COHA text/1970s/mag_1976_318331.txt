Suddenly Gerald Ford ran into his toughest week of the presidential campaign-and perhaps of his entire political career . For a month Ford has been closing fast on Jimmy Carter . But now the President was struck by a series of setbacks that were remarkable even in this mercurial year , marked by flip-flops at the podiums and in the polls . Amid the flood of blunders and bad news , there were also reports that revived questions about the President 's probity in the past . Some of the charges were both old and minor , but even his supporters feared that unless Ford was able to make a clear and quick refutation , he would be seriously damaged . <P> As Ford was besieged on every side , Carter 's camp worked overtime to take advantage of the situation . Nobody has ever accused Carter of lacking an instinct for the jugular , and he displayed it clearly throughout the week . For the first time since Labor Day , the Democratic candidate was scoring points with the voters , as he crisscrossed the country and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attacks , Carter was so aggressive that it was possible he would provoke a sympathetic backlash for Ford-if the allegations about him were shown to be untrue or grossly overblown . But for the moment , the President gave the Democrats plenty to criticize : <P> &gt; Ford 's grasp of foreign policy and even his mere competence were called into question during his debate with Carter when he insisted that the Soviet Union does not dominate Eastern Europe . <P> &gt; His ability to manage economic policy-and his hopes of going into the election with a nicely improving economy-Were challenged by the news that in September wholesale prices jumped at about an 11% annual rate , the steepest rise in eleven months , and that unemployment declined only a hair , to 7.8% ( see ECONOMY &; BUSINESS ) . <P> &gt; His leadership capacity was again being debated because of his hesitation in firing Agriculture Secretary Earl Butz for making an obscene , racist remark . <P> &gt; His straight-arrow reputation came under suspicion because of reports , confirmed by the White House , that in 1972 he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and plane tickets . The amounts were relatively small and , in the case of the plane tickets , quickly paid back to his campaign fund . But Ford had violated Congress 's Code of Official Conduct , which states that " a member shall keep his campaign funds separate from his personal funds " and " shall expend no funds from his campaign account not attributable to bona fide campaign purpose . " Such separations can be difficult and ambiguous , as any taxpayer knows who has dealt with ( and perhaps fudged ) the line between personal and business expenses . <P> Further , Watergate Special Prosecutor Charles Ruff , who is investigating Ford 's use of his congressional campaign money , last week brought a witness to testify before a Washington grand jury . The witness was Jesse Calhoon , president of the National Marine Engineers Beneficial Association , one of the two maritime unions that contributed to Ford 's campaign funds when he was a Congressman but more recently broke with him .               @ @ @ @ @ @
