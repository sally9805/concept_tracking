A MANUAL FOR MANUEL <P> by Julio Cortzar <P> Pantheon ; 389 pages ; $10.95 <P> Argentina is a country rich in every thing but stability . The nation has been so cursed by bloody political convulsions that its own best people have pro nounced their homeland incurable . Julio Cortzar 's novel , A Manual for Manuel , is one Argentine expatriate 's eccentric response to violence in his country ( and to some extent Uruguay and Brazil ) in the early 1970s . Cortzar , who has lived in Paris for some decades , writes in a surreal fashion . The effects can be dazzling - as in All Fires the Fire and Other Stories of several years ago . Here , in a disjointed narrative , he gives a low-key , comic and rather appealing picture of " the Screwery , " a band of romantic South American revolutionaries based in France . As the book commences , they are subverting the Establishment by filling new cigarette packages with burnt-out butts , and smuggling cartons of the fakes into bars and tobacco shops to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matters , among them the kidnaping of a South American police official . <P> As Cortzar wrote , he clipped news paper articles about political torture and other governmental outrages . He has his characters read these from day to day and paste them into a scrapbook for little Manuel , the baby son of two cell mem bers . The dispatches are photocopied in the novel so that the fictional Manuel , and all of the real Manuels who may be involved in the struggle some day , will know what their elders were fighting against . But there is no real attempt to examine the causes of right-wing terror or the pendulum swing left to counterterror . <P> Cortzar finished his book in 1972 , when the oppressive and ineffective General Alejandro Lanusse was President . A note to the American reader says that conditions under the present military government of General Jorge Videla are just as bad . This may be true , but it seems somewhat disingenuous not to have men tioned that between Lanusse and Videla was another leader of some notoriety . His name was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years ( 1946-55 , 1973-74 ) . His second coming lasted just one year . Then he died , leaving the country to his wife Isabelita , and to chaos . During the last Peronista years , terror spread by the guerrilla left was a similar but bloodier version of that practiced by the Screwery . It paralyzed the country with out materially advancing the revolution aries ' aims - and brought on the current repression . There have been some signs that the Videla regime would like to govern in a more moderate fashion , when extremists let them . And the pendulum swings on . - John Show
