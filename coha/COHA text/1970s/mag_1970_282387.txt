Since the charge was made three weeks ago that most cereals offer little nutritional value , the issue has grown from a tempest in a breakfast bowl to a national debate that has provided wits and pundits with plenty of grist . In one of many newspaper cartoons , a worried father says to his child : " I want to talk to you , son . It 's about the cereal we have insisted that you eat ... " Columnists , with varying degrees of levity , have called the health promises for cereals so much pap , cackle and puff . Bumper stickers note that " Jack Armstrong died of malnutrition . " <P> Preoccupied though it was with other weighty matters , Congress last week provided a forum at which the cereal makers defended themselves . For representatives of the industry , which spends $87.5 million yearly in TV advertising , the hearing was a sober matter . They had to face charges by Robert Choate , a consultant to last year 's White House Conference on Food Nutrition and Health , that their health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more nutritious foods . <P> A Matter of Taste . In testimony before the Senate consumer subcommittee , industry officers and some nutritionists contended that dry cereals should not be evaluated alone , but in combination with milk . Even cereal with milk , they said , was never intended to be the sole source of protein , minerals and vitamins at breakfast . " A breakfast of cereal and milk , " testified Harvard Nutritionist Fredrick Stare , " along with some fruit , a couple of pieces of toast , some polyunsaturated margarine , a little jelly and jam , is just as nutritious as a bacon-and-eggs breakfast with fruit , toast and something to put on . the toast . " As for the cereal makers ' marketing tactics , Dr. Robert Nesheim , research and development chief at Quaker Oats , argued : " No one will get food nutrition into his stomach unless the product has an appealing taste . I see nothing wrong with promoting quality products on the basis of taste , convenience and even premiums . " <P> An equally distinguished panel of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a Cornell professor , condemned cereal advertising . " The consumer has been led to believe that ordinary cereals have a nutritive value superior to common foods such as bread , hominy grits , rice , spaghetti , baked beans , potatoes and pizza , " he said . " This is not true . " Besides , Latham added , " Puffed rice is five times as expensive as ordinary rice and yet provides smaller amounts of most nutrients . " <P> Harvard Nutritionist Dr. Jean Mayer pointed out that different brands of cereals vary widely in nutritional values . " Such differences , " he argued , " could easily be avoided and many products upgraded . " It would be fairly easy , for example , for the companies to add more vitamins and minerals to cereals . They already produce some highly fortified cereals , notably Kellogg 's Product 19 and General Mills ' Kaboom and Total .
