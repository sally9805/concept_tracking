A highrise apartment . No one home . Light coming in the balcony window from the buildings across the street . Light shining under the door to the hall . There is someone in the hall , opening the door with a key . This is hard to hear because there is music blasting from the apartment next door . As the door to the hallway opens , the music blares louder . It 's DAISY 's apartment . She is a little high , glad the music is as loud as it is . She dances into the apartment . RAFE hangs back in the corridor . He has never been here before . In fact , he has never been to an apartment building which seemed to promise such high times . DAISY turns on the lights , pulls him into the apartment , closes the door behind them and bolts it . The music is still too loud to encourage conversation . DAISY dances instead . RAFE looks around while she dances off with his jacket . He is carrying a guitar case and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his guitar . DAISY thinks she 's going to have a private concert . She bangs on her neighbour 's wall . Hard . The music becomes sub-audible . RAFE plays guitar like a good ole boy from East Texas . He need not be very good . Even if he were good , DAISY would hate it . She is n't comfortable west of Bathurst Street . RAFE ( sings ) I said I liked the way you looked I said I liked your style And I sat right down beside you Bought a drink and watched you smile . I told you I picked a guitar with A country ' n western band But I did n't want another one night stand . ( RAFE begins to yodel . He knows DAISY hates it ) p. 3 RAFE I wrote that song . I 'm a composer . DAISY I guess . RAFE But I 've got a lot of other songs here ... They 're sort of audition tapes . ( He produces cassettes from his knapsack ) DAISY You 've got your whole wardrobe . You 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you may move in for the next six months . RAFE And you 'll be trapped up here with a fugitive from Grand Ole Opry . Do n't worry . I only came up here so you could sew the sequins on my shirt . DAISY I think you should take your shirt off . RAFE You 're kidding . DAISY Who me ? RAFE You want me with my shirt off ? DAISY Sure . RAFE Well , sure , okay . ( He starts to unbutton his shirt ) DAISY I want to see if you 've got a tattoo someplace that says mother . ( RAFE stops unbuttoning his shirt ) RAFE You were kidding . ( DAISY nods ) You 've got a real good sense of humour . p. 4 DAISY It 's an act , is n't it ? You 're all country boy and flannel shirts and aw shucks ... RAFE What do you want me to be ? ( DAISY laughs ) Why did you let me pick you up if you thought I was a phoney ? DAISY I picked you up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that why ? Really ? DAISY I think so . ( The telephone rings . DAISY wants to answer it ) RAFE When are you going to know for sure ? DAISY The telephone ... RAFE You do n't care about the telephone . ( As she picks it up ) You know , I wrote a really boring song about it . About waiting for the phone to ring . DAISY ( on the phone ) Hello ... oh , hello , mother . RAFE Oh sure . DAISY ( on the phone ) No , thanks very much for calling ... No , thanks very much . RAFE Does your mother call you at 11:30 every night ? Is that to check up on the guy you brought home ? p. 5 DAISY ( on the phone ) Well , yes , but I do n't have time to talk to you right now . Well , yes , because there are some people here ... Well , yes , it 's sort of a party ... RAFE Where ? DAISY ( on the phone ) Just some friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phone ) No really , thanks very much for calling but I have to get back to the party , that 's all ... Say hi to him from me too ... Say hi to Aunti Vi ... Say hi to Tippy and Edward ... Good-bye . ( She hangs up ) You see . That was long distance . RAFE It was your mother . DAISY So ? RAFE I bet she would have called back . DAISY Everybody calls back . RAFE How would you know ? You pick up the phone every time it rings . DAISY She wanted to wish me Happy Birthday , that 's all . ( Beat ) RAFE Is it your birthday ? p. 6 DAISY So my mother tells me . I guess she should know . RAFE Happy Birthday , Daisy . DAISY ( flat ) Thanks . RAFE Where 's your party ? DAISY Oh come on . RAFE The one you told your mother about . Where are all your friends ? Where 's the cake , where 's the presents ? DAISY I hate cake . RAFE Nobody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vegetarian . RAFE Since when are cakes made out of meat . DAISY Sugar . Sugar . They are made out of refined sugar ... RAFE How come you go out picking up strangers on your birthday ? Hey , Daisy ? Hey , babe ? DAISY Because I 'm adventurous . ( RAFE lights one of the candles sitting on the coffee table ) RAFE Do you want an adventure ? ( He hands the candle to DAISY ) Make a wish . ( DAISY blows the candle out . A beat ) p. 7 DAISY I got that candle in Majorca . RAFE Oh yeah . DAISY ( picking up another one ) And I got this one in Port-au-Prince . RAFE You 're sentimental . You remind me of my sister . DAISY I 'm not sentimental . RAFE I 'm going to throw a birthday party for you . So you can feel young again . We 'll have balloons and crepe paper streamers and funny hats . Have you got any balloons ? DAISY I do n't care about birthdays . I 'm grown up now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No . RAFE Here . I made you a funny hat . ( He has made a cocked hat out of newspaper . He drops it on her head ) DAISY The last time I had a hat like this , I had cake on my face . ( She tries it out in one of her mirrors , tries to make it more sophisticated ) RAFE Going to make you a cake . DAISY No ! p. 8 RAFE Do you have any eggs ? DAISY Stay out of that refrigerator . ( But RAFE has opened the refrigerator . He whoops ) RAFE ( with the cake ) Hey , Daisy , I do n't have to make a cake ... Look . Because the good birthday cake tooth fairy has put this chocolate layer cake in that refrigerator and it says Happy Birthday Daisy on the top ... What do you think about that ? DAISY It 's my cake . RAFE I see that . DAISY Okay ... Now you know . RAFE Know what ? DAISY Now you can have your big laugh . RAFE I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You know it 's been scientifically discovered that people who make jokes about other people are very unsure of themselves . DAISY Who discovered that , Albert Einstein ? RAFE That 's why stand-up comics are unhappy . DAISY Oh sure . p. 9 RAFE Stand-up comics have the highest suicide rate of any occupational group . DAISY Oh sure . RAFE That 's true . DAISY Oh sure . You see them lining up to jump off the CN Tower . RAFE You argue about everything , do n't you ? DAISY I mean , people do n't kill themselves because they have a sense of humour . RAFE The last person I know committed suicide was a girl I went to school with . We used to call her Laugh-A-Minute Appleton . DAISY What do they call you ? ( Beat ) RAFE How come you have this big cake , Daisy ? DAISY For my big party . What do you think ? RAFE There can still be a party . You do n't have to be so mad about it . DAISY I mean a dinner party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was supposed , to bring her stupid boyfriend , Eddie ... RAFE Who were you supposed to bring ? DAISY No one . p. 10 RAFE Who ? DAISY Look , that 's another story . RAFE What 's his name ? DAISY ( with some finality ) Nick . RAFE ( arranges an imaginary table ) Sharon . And Eddie . And Daisy . And Nick ... Where 's Nick ? DAISY I 've known Sharon for years . We went to Daniel Mac High School together . In Winnipeg , if you really want the sad dull tale . And after she finished high school , she bought a bus ticket to Los Angeles . She said she was the only girl from Daniel Mac High School ever to do that and the first person she met in Los Angeles married her and brought her back to Winnipeg every Ukranian Christmas , but she really hated him . But it turns out he knew a guy who knew a guy at Ashleigh Famous and she got a job , she finally did , in the national tour of Disney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the movie magazines except that she did n't get into the movies . She danced the part of Dewey Duck for eighteen months with a big papier mache duck head on her head ... Can you imagine anything that stupid ? I mean , Sharon and I used to take dancing lessons together . From Rita Melnick . She was a June Taylor Dancer before she moved to Winnipeg . ( Beat ) I could always dance better than Sharon could , but I never had the guts . p. 11 RAFE I thought you picked me up . I thought that was gutsy . DAISY You picked me up . RAFE I think you 're gutsy . I think you 're very brave . DAISY Sharon thinks I 'm a pushover . She quit the show the second time she toured through Buffalo . She took a Greyhound bus to Toronto and moved in with me . RAFE When are you expecting Sharon ? DAISY And I am a pushover . I let her stay . For three weeks in a bachelor apartment . I might have let her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hockey , believe it or not . I mean , really he sells insurance but he and the other salesmen play hockey every week and pretend they 're Bobby Clarke . It 's like a beer commercial . RAFE Is Sharon staying with Eddie ? DAISY You know why she told me we were friends ? When we were kids ? Because I had every Nancy Drew book ever written . Too bad for me she 's such a slow reader . RAFE Is Sharon going to walk in on us ? DAISY I 'm glad she met Eddie even if I sit around till 9:30 looking at a dinner that 's supposed to be served at eight and a stupid looking chocolate cake . And I 'm glad Nicky got a chance to phone me and tell me he had to work late . Because what I really wanted tonight was an overpriced drink in a cheap bar and a chance to meet new people . p. 12 RAFE I 'm sorry . DAISY I 'll bet . RAFE Really . I like you , Daisy . DAISY Sharon said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She said I looked more like a duck than she did . RAFE I can quack like a duck . DAISY Oh sure . RAFE Quack quack . DAISY I needed that . RAFE You try it . DAISY Do n't be stupid . RAFE Quack quack . DAISY You 're quacking in my ear . RAFE Quack . Quack . Let me see your imitation of a duck . Come on . DAISY Quack quack . RAFE ( encouraging ) Quack quack . DAISY Quack quack . RAFE ( moving cushions ) This is a Hide-A-Bed Sofa , is n't it ? ( The telephone rings ) Oh no ! p. 13 DAISY I can answer it . RAFE After the mating call of the eiderdown goose ? DAISY ( picking up the phone ) Hello , Sharon ... oh , good-bye Sharon . RAFE Do n't hang up . ( He stops Daisy before she can cradle the receiver ) Tell her you have some people over . DAISY ( plays along ) I 'm glad you called earlier , Sharon . I 'm sorry I was out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . DAISY It 's too bad you did n't call before dinner . To say you could n't come ... RAFE I 'll make party noises . I 'll get my guitar . ( He does ) DAISY You did not forget it was my birthday , Sharon . You were born on July 20th and I was born on March 20th . RAFE Not everyone has a composer at their party . DAISY That 's a friend of mine . He 's a composer . He 's playing his guitar . RAFE ( sings ) That Sharon is a real bitch , is n't she ? p. 14 DAISY ( on the phone ) What do you mean , ha ? There are lots of people here , Sharon . I can hardly hear what you 're saying . RAFE ( takes the phone ) Let me talk to her . DAISY ( knocks on table ) Just a minute , Sharon . There 's someone at the door . RAFE ( on the phone ) There are lots of people here , Sharon . I ca n't hear what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Are you calling me a liar , listen nobody calls me a liar . Who are you , you think I 'm such a phoney ? DAISY ( discovers tape recorder ) Here are some people at my party and I do n't know how to turn them on . ( She takes the taps recorder back to RAFE , expecting to continue the game ) RAFE ( on the phone ) Who are you , you phoney bitch ? ( RAFE 's anger has escalated quickly enough to be puzzling . DAISY tries to pull the phone away ) DAISY Let me talk to her . RAFE Nobody 's going to make a liar out of me . We 're going to have a party . p. 15 DAISY ( on the phone ) I guess he had a little too much to drink , Sharon . RAFE ( opens door to apartment hallway ) I 'm going to get some people . DAISY ( on the phone ) Wait a minte ... Rafe , where are you going ? RAFE Going to ask your neighbours to your party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hate my neighbours . RAFE ( exit ) That 's not neighbourly . DAISY ( on the phone ) What do you mean " Who 's my friend ? " ... He does not sound crazy , Sharon , we are having a party , that 's all ... I do n't know where Nicky is and I do n't care . ( There is a shriek of delight from RIVA next door ) No , he is n't here ... I do have other friends ... What do you mean " who ? " ( Someone bangs on the wall , " Shave and a haircut " DAISY bangs back " Two bits . " ) He is n't crazy , he 's a musician ... He 's a singer . No , he does n't want to sing you something . He does n't even want to talk to you . He ca n't talk to you because he is n't here right now , he 's next door , he just banged on the wall . Stop laughing , Sharon ... Listen , there 's a tape of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can listen to that for a while . ( There is a knock on the door . RAFE closed it behind him ) p. 16 DAISY Wait a minute , Sharon ... ( DAISY puts the tape recorder next to the phone and turns up the volume ) How 's that , Sharon ? Can you hear that all right ? RAFE ( outside door ) Daisy ? ( There is a knock on the door . On the tape , RAFE sings : " I said I liked the way you looked , " and the song continues under ) DAISY And he 's at the door , too . Just a minute , Sharon . I have to answer the door . ( There is a burst of laughter from RIVA as DAISY opens the door ) Rafe ? Rafe ? ( The song ends on tape . There is applause , a girl 's laughter . There is no one at the door . DAISY leaves the door open and goes back to the phone ) He was at the door , Sharon , but he got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't want to talk to you anymore , I 've got better things to do . What girl on the tape ? There is n't any girl on the tape . ( The girl on the tape laughs again . It sounds like a seduction ) Good-bye Sharon . ( DAISY hangs up . The tape continues with soft murmurs , rustling , everything but bed springs creaking . DAISY is listening intently to the tape as RAFE enters from the hallway ) p. 17 RAFE The girl next door says she does know you . She met you in the laundromat . Her name is Riva , do you remember ? ( DAISY ignores him , engrossed in the tape . There is a laugh from RIVA next door which sounds through the wall , as all RIVA 's sounds do ) RAFE Another minute and she was going to let me climb over here by her balcony railing . You know how close your balcony is to Riva 's balcony ? ( He demonstrates with his hands ) DAISY Yes I do . RAFE Have you ever been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she upholstered the floor and she has John Wayne posters all over the walls . She and this weird guy are sitting around rubbing oil all over him so she said they were n't dressed for a party . ( Very loud disco music begins in RIVA 's apartment . It drowns out DAISY 's voice ) DAISY Who is the girl on the tape ? RAFE What ? ( DAISY goes over , pounds on the wall . Someone pounds back . The volume of sound is lowered . RAFE turns his tape recorder off ) DAISY Who is the girl on the tape ? p. 18 RAFE What girl ? ( DAISY stares him down ) She 's a fan , I guess . DAISY Oh sure . RAFE I did n't know her very well . DAISY You were making love to her . You have a tape recording where you 're making love to her . RAFE I did n't get a chance to turn it off . DAISY I noticed . RAFE Look , you did n't think I was raised in a locker room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ RIVA shrieks ) Riva really screams a lot , does n't she ? DAISY I do n't care about your girls ... RAFE Maybe she 's in some kind of trouble ... she 's screaming ... DAISY Shrieking . RAFE She is screaming and you do n't even care . DAISY Ca n't you tell the difference between a scream and a shriek ? They are in bed together . Or she 's swinging from the shower rail . It 's showtime . RAFE Is it the Jack the Ripper Show ? p. 19 DAISY No . RAFE There 's a pretty big weird looking guy in there with her . He told me he sold exploding cigars and dribble glasses . ( Random bumps from next door ) Maybe we should call the police ? DAISY Who ? RAFE For next door . Listen . DAISY ( because the music continues ) I 've heard all her records already . RAFE Maybe she 's getting strangled . Or smothered . DAISY I 've heard her scream too . She screams in the laundromat . She screams when her wash turns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to get involved . DAISY You 're kidding . RAFE You 're isolated . You 're alone . DAISY Some people do not mind being isolated and alone , you know . Some people like privacy . ( There is a cry of Ole from next door ) You see , he did n't strangle her . RAFE Yet . ( There is the crack of a whip from next door ) Maybe I should go back in there , check the situation out . p. 20 DAISY If I were swinging from the shower rail , I would n't thank you for the interruption . RAFE I 'm going . ( DAISY bars the door ) DAISY You 're embarrassing me . ( The telephone rings . RAFE picks it up ) RAFE ( on the phone ) Hello ... Can I tell her who 's calling ? ... It 's Nicky . ( He dangles the phone in front of her . She grabs for it . He is kind enough to know she 'd like to talk to Nicky alone ) RAFE ( exit ) Here I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Like Tyrone Power in Captain from Castile . DAISY ( on the phone ) Hello , Nicky ... He 's just a guy , Nicky ... I do n't know , I just met him . That 's right , it 's my birthday and I went out and picked up a guy ... Well , I did call you first , Nicky , but they told me you were n't working late at the office so I wondered where it was you were working late ... That 's right . You got it . I do n't trust you . ( DAISY hangs up . And bursts into tears . There is a knock on the door ) RAFE ( outside ) Hey , Daisy , I locked myself out . ( The telephone rings . DAISY reaches for it ) p. 21 DAISY ( on the phone ) Hello ... I do n't care if you 're sorry , Nicky . I do n't care if I should have told you when my birthday was . Is it so hard to remember a birthday ? I know your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were n't you ? It did not conflict with your wife 's subscription concert series ... I am not crying . ( DAISY slams the phone down again . RAFE enters behind DAISY , through the balcony doors . He is wearing a rubber Richard Nixon mask . DAISY hangs up the phone , he reaches down and takes it off the hook . She sees the hand before she 's really realized he 's there . She looks up at him . She screams ) RAFE Guess who . DAISY What are you doing on my balcony ? RAFE It 's okay . It 's only me . Rafe . The guy with Riva sells these wholesale . DAISY ( looking for it ) Valium . RAFE I scared you . You do n't trust me . DAISY I do n't trust anybody . RAFE You know what you have on your balcony ? I bet you forgot about it . There 's a dead Christmas tree out there . DAISY Who cares ? p. 22 RAFE ( produces tree on stand , no needles ) I bet they told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their fire insurance rates or something . But that did n't stop you . You smuggled it in ... DAISY I 'm a real rebel . RAFE And here it is March and you have n't had the guts to smuggle it out again . DAISY I 'm impulsive . RAFE You know what I think we should do ? Since we do n't have any crepe paper ? We should decorate the tree for your birthday . DAISY Over my dead body . RAFE Why ? Do you think it 's sacrilegious ? DAISY Will you stop pretending you 're so god damn cute ? Can we please remember that I picked you up , that 's all . We are not supposed to be decorating a Christmas tree . RAFE Look , Daisy ... ( He hangs the Richard Nixon mask on top of the tree . She laughs . He takes off his St. Christopher medal and hangs it on the tree . She takes off her bracelets and throws them toward the tree , aiming for one of the branches . He takes off his boots and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He takes off his belt and hangs it on the tree . She takes the flower out of her hair and hangs it on the tree . The whole scene becomes progressively giddier and more Rabelaisian . There seems to be nothing left to do but move the coffee table and pull out the Hide-A-Bed Sofa . They are a little embarrassed by the finality of it all . They jump into bed enthusiastically to show they are n't embarrassed . RAFE kisses her . DAISY laughs ) p. 23 DAISY Do you wnat to turn your tape recorder on ? RAFE What ? DAISY Do you want to turn your tape recorder on ? RAFE ( rolls away from her ) What do you mean ? DAISY We could try for the top ten . ( She laughs longer . He has his back to her . She reaches out to touch him ) RAFE Why are you all messed up with a married man ? DAISY I beg your pardon ? RAFE Nicky . DAISY I do n't care about Nicky . RAFE He 's married , is n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ RAFE I mean , if you 're supposed to be so mature . Is that supposed to be adult behavior ? DAISY Well , kids do n't do it . RAFE Let 's talk . DAISY I do n't want to talk . RAFE Let 's try to get to know each other . Let 's be friends . p. 24 DAISY I do n't want to be friends . RAFE Do your friends have to pay at the door ? DAISY What do you mean ? RAFE Do you have to have a reason for being friends with people ? Do you have to get something from all your friends ? DAISY No . RAFE I am not the kind of guy who thinks that just because a fairly beautiful chick who is anyway five years older than me picks me up in a disco and brings me home to her highrise apartment , I am not the kind of guy who thinks that means we 're going to climb into bed with each other right away or anything . I mean , I know we have to get to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each other . DAISY Ha . RAFE I mean if I wanted to sit around with a complete stranger I could have gone to the bus depot , right ? DAISY Right ! RAFE I mean , for example , what do you do ? DAISY Who cares ? RAFE I can guess people 's occupations . The other day I guessed a guy who was a chocolate dipper . You 're going to be easy . p. 25 DAISY I would be if you gave me half a chance . RAFE You work in a bank . DAISY I beg your pardon . RAFE Am I right ? Do you know how I knew ? DAISY Why did you guess I worked in a bank ? RAFE I 'm magic . DAISY There is nothing duller than banking , is there ? Why did you take one look at me and think that I worked in a bank ? RAFE I do too . DAISY What ? RAFE Takes one to know one . DAISY Ha . RAFE I 'm a loan officer . DAISY What bank do you work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bank manager saw you walking around dressed like that , he 'd tell you to get a job with a finance company . RAFE Would I lie to you ? DAISY You do n't even have a bank account . RAFE I 'm perfectly presentable . I have a whole collection of Herb Alpert records . I have an attache case with my initials on it . I have some Canada Savings Bonds and a 1976 Datsun and a really great future . The only difference between us is you were born in Winnipeg and I was born in Kapuskasing . ( DAISY wishes they were in bed . She reaches for him . He pulls away ) p. 26 RAFE Does it make you feel safe to think I 'm just like you are ? DAISY You and your plaid flannel shirt and your guitar case and your jeans are too damn tight you know . You were standing there , arguing with the bouncer and I hustled you out on the street . RAFE Because you 're adventurous . DAISY And you 're nervous . RAFE Me ? DAISY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with you ? Make an audition tape ? RAFE ( reaching for his glass ) What 's in this drink anyway ? DAISY It 's a Marguerita . Marguerita is Daisy in French . RAFE How do you make a drink like that ? DAISY It 's tequila and lime juice and you rub salt around the edge of the glass . RAFE Is that right ? DAISY I learned to make it last year in Mexico . In San Miguel de Allende . That 's the artists ' colony . RAFE Here I am with a Marguerita in a highrise apartment that looks like Mary Tyler Moore slept here . p. 27 DAISY What is that supposed to mean ? RAFE You remind me of my sister . DAISY I do not . RAFE Her name is Marguerita . That 's Daisy in French . DAISY Cut it out . RAFE My sister is French . So am I. DAISY Oh sure . RAFE So am I. DAISY Your name is n't French . RAFE My name is Raoul but no one can spell it . I mean , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? But you know what Raoul is in English ? Ralph . I mean , would you have picked me up if my name was Ralph ? DAISY I would have picked you up if your name was Rover . But you do n't seem to understand that . RAFE What I try to tell my sister is there 's more to life than sex . DAISY In Kapuskasing ? RAFE There is adventure . DAISY I do n't remember what sex is like . It 's been so long that I 've forgotten . RAFE You think making jokes is adventurous . You think if you go somewhere you 've never been before ... If you wake up in the morning and you do n't know who with , that 's an adventure . p. 28 DAISY Yes . I do . RAFE It is low level adventure . It is low life . DAISY What do you want me to do ? Discover insulin ? RAFE I want you to talk to me . I want you to listen to me . DAISY I do n't want you to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed is the only thing I do . Sex is not the only thing in my life , but it is the only thing right now , that 's all . I 'm very single-minded . RAFE Did you ever see Captain from Castile ? DAISY No . RAFE Did you see Son of Ali Baba with Piper Laurie and Tony Curtis in it ? Or the one where they squeezed Tony Curtis ' eye like it was a grape ? DAISY No . RAFE What I need to do is ride to the rescue , am I right ? The strange prince of the desert drugs the young virgin he met at the foreign exchange counter and drags her off on his camel . And she gets sand in her hair ... And she gets sand between her teeth . And there is sand at the back of her throat ... DAISY Why ? RAFE Because she 's trying to get away . p. 29 DAISY Why ? RAFE Because she 's heard about the initiation rite . I mean the loathsome initiation rite that inspired the phrase " a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's a fate worse than death ? RAFE I need to get you away from your birthday parties and your bank job . You know why you 're in that bank job ? Because your friend is the bank manager , is n't that so ? What 's his name ? Nicky ? DAISY Nick . RAFE Yeah . Whoever heard of a bank manager named Nicky . DAISY How did you know that ? RAFE I 'm going to rescue you . I 'm going to tear these sheets in strips and throw you over my shoulder and climb down over the balcony just like in the movies . DAISY How did you know about Nicky ? RAFE Except we 're on the seventeenth floor . DAISY How do you know everything I 'm going to say before I 'm going to say it ? RAFE Because I heard it before . Because Joan Crawford was in it . Joan Crawford always liked married guys . p. 30 DAISY The worst part about married guys is they 're so grateful . Or that 's the worse part about Nicky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DAISY He does almost everything right . RAFE I bet he told you he could get you into an IBM Training Course . So your future would be secure . I bet he told you he would call you every time the symphony concert had an intermission . DAISY We do n't argue all the time , anyway . RAFE Is that all you want ? DAISY Like I argue with you . RAFE Is that all you want , not to argue ? DAISY And he makes me feel elegant . RAFE You are elegant , Daisy . DAISY He makes me feel like ... look , I do n't know , he bought me this dress ... RAFE It 's a pretty dress . DAISY It 's a wonderful dress . It 's a dream of a dress . Because he 's married already , he 's got enough of real life . RAFE You are a beautiful , elegant lady , Daisy . p. 31 DAISY Then why do you make me feel smart ass ? ( Beat ) RAFE I do n't want to fight with you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me to do ? ( DAISY turns down the sheet on his side of the bed ) RAFE Is that all ? ( RAFE brings her her drink . He lies down beside her . He still feels uncomfortable . He takes a sip from the drink and makes a horrible face ) RAFE Is this supposed to be a Marguerita ? DAISY Yes . RAFE Do you call this a Marguerita ? DAISY Yes . RAFE Let me mix you a Marguerita . ( He jumps out of bed to demonstrate ) Do you know how to do it ? You take a jigger full of tequila and you pour it over crushed ice ... you fill the glass up with lime juice and then you rub salt around the edge of the glass . DAISY Where did you learn to do that ? RAFE I used to be a bartender. p. 32 DAISY Oh sure . RAFE That 's how I got out of Kapuskasing . That 's how I worked my way through school . I was sitting in the Holiday Motor Inn beverage room in Kapuskasing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Do you know why they were called Dark Victory ? They were all blind , but that was n't the worst part . The worst part was they were tone deaf too . I said to myself , look at those guys . They are terrible but they do not have to live in Kapuskasing eighty per cent of the time . I was cleaning under my fingernails with a paper match and I saw on the matchbook cover , Learn a Trade . So I sent off for the free aptitude test and I found out I should be a bartender . I was sixteen years old . Now you probably know , at that time , you had to be twenty one years old to be a bartender . But I had to get out of Kapuskasing , you see . Because it 's the bush , you know and you can cry all you want to about getting back to the land , but the land is very nutsy when you come right down to it . I do n't know if you have ever come right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be out in the bush and the nutsy thing is there is nothing going on out there . Nothing . There are a lot of people who will try to tell you that nothing is peaceful , but do n't let them kid you because it 's noisy . I mean , there is the wind in the trees all the time . It 's windy and that is only one example . A country stream is a picture of bucolic simplicty to most people who do not have to sit beside it , hearing it . Kachunga . Kachunga . Kachunga . The water rushing over pebbles . Dzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz . The wind in the grass . Of course , there is no wonder that the noise in the country is so omnipresent because of all the stuff going on . Nature . Nature is very busy , of course , There are so many things growing and eating and changing into chlorophyll that it makes the Yonge Street Strip look like the core of down-town Detroit .

Kapuskasing . What are they ? Maybe five hundred miles apart ? I mean , if you were looking at a map of the globe and somebody trying to explain the difference between Detroit and Kapuskasing , you would n't even have time to listen , would you ? Who the hell cares where I come from as long as I go away ? DAISY What is it you really do ? RAFE For work you mean ? DAISY Yes . RAFE I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I just got out of prison .

RAFE You come here and sit beside me ... Come on ... DAISY No . RAFE Why are we chasing each other around the room ? Nervous , are n't you ? Is it because you 're a vegetarian ?

DAISY Give me the phone book . RAFE ( as she dials ) Why would I kill anybody ? No , really . Why would I kill a girl ? Look , it 's because you were coming on at me , right ? All about how to mix drinks and what kind of music . And how I should get myself a good job in a bank . Look , I think you 're a very nice girl . You 're a beautiful girl . And you 're very warm ... DAISY ( on the phone ) Hello , Sharon ... RAFE You really called her ... The girl who thinks you look like a duck . DAISY ( on the phone ) Can you get over here ? Fast ? RAFE You 're going to hate yourself if you tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( He takes the phone ) p. 36 DAISY Give me that phone . RAFE ( on the phone ) Hello , Sharon ? ... Hi , it 's Rafe ... How come you have n't heard about me when I know so much about you ? I do ... I know you danced with Disney on Parade . DAISY Let me talk to her . RAFE ( on the phone ) Quack quack eh Sharon ?

In this apartment with a very weird guy , Sharon . RAFE Me ? DAISY He does not sound nice . RAFE The trouble with bankers is they never have a sense of humour . DAISY ( on the phone ) I am going to tell him to go . As soon as I get off the phone . But what if he wo n't go ? RAFE She thinks I 'm weird . DAISY ( on the phone ) I am not in the shower . I did not just get out of the shower . He told you that . He is weird , Sharon . He lies all the time . RAFE I lie ? Oh sure . I do n't go around pretending I was born in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) You can bring Eddie . And Eddie can bring his hockey stick .

DAISY ( on the phone ) What do you mean what 's the use of coming back ? Because I need you , Sharon . This weird guy could murder me . RAFE Oh sure . Oh brother . That does it . DAISY ( on the phone ) I know I could be dead before you got here , Sharon . That 's exactly the point . RAFE ( struggling with locks on the door ) You 're the kind of loony lady who locks herself in with an axe murderer . DAISY ( on the phone ) How am I supposed to call the cops , Sharon ? I am talking to you on the phone . RAFE ( at the door ) Good-bye , okay ? DAISY ( on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think he 's leaving . RAFE ( exit ) The trouble with people who work in banks , they 're much too imaginative . p. 39 DAISY ( on the phone ) He 's gone . Oh wow ! Sharon , he 's gone . He just wound himself up and slammed out of the apartment . ( There is a shriek of laughter from next door ) I am not hysterical . I am perfectly calm . That is Riva screaming in the background ... I do n't know , maybe she opened her refrigerator and the little light went on . ( RIVA laughs ) That 's right , I picked him up ... I did not pick him up because I was angry with you . I do n't care that you were n't at my birthday party ... Well , fortunately , it does n't matter what you think . Fortunately , you can crawl back into bed with your friend Eddie and no further thought of me ... No , I 'm fine , Sharon ... I would n't want you to drive half an hour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm hysterical . Good-bye , Sharon . ( She hangs up the telephone . There is a tap on the window behind her . She turns to see RAFE wearing a Dracula mask and an evening cape that could belong to no one but RIVA . DAISY screams . RAFE waves . She turns back to the phone and starts dialling rapidly as RAFE enters the room behind her ) RAFE Do n't scream , Daisy ... You 're always on the phone , are n't you ? ( DAISY fumbles the phone and starts to dial again ) I 'm going all right ? Do you want me to go ? I forgot my guitar , that 's all . And my tape recorder . And I came back for my shoes . Look , a guy walking around without shoes at this time of night is going to get picked up by the cops . It 's March , Daisy . You 're supposed to wear shoes in March . p. 40 DAISY ( on the phone ) I 'll give you cops . RAFE Are you calling the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ screams ) Stop screaming ! DAISY Stay away from me . RAFE What am I doing on the seventeenth floor of a high rise apartment with a crazy screaming lady who thinks I murder girls ? DAISY You told me you murder girls . RAFE Did you believe me when I said I came from Kapuskasing ? DAISY Yes ! RAFE Ha ! Did you believe me when I said I came from Detroit ? Did you believe me when I said I worked in a bank ? DAISY What am I supposed to believe ? RAFE Why are n't your neighbours beating down the door ? You 're screaming like I killed you and nothing happens . ( There is a shriek from the apartment next door ) You do n't care about Riva next door so she does n't care about you . DAISY You are so exhausting . RAFE ( shouting ) Where are all you people ? Daisy was screaming ! She could have been dying in here and you all want to pretend it 's a K-Tel commercial . ( Still louder ) In memory of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called the police . RAFE Not a chance . DAISY You do n't know . I spilled a bag of brown rice once and they called the police . They hear everything . ( RAFE yells like Tarzan ) RAFE Ah-eeee-ahhhhhhh ! DAISY What 's going on ? RAFE Did they hear that ? ( RIVA did . She calls Ah-eee-ahhhh ! like Tarzan back . RAFE tackles DAISY and throws her down on the couch ) Would they hear if I swung through the trees with you ? ( DAISY screams . The people next door scream in reply and pound on the wall . RAFE gets up off DAISY ) Okay . I 'll call the police . ( RAFE reaches for the phone and dials ) DAISY What ? RAFE If you 're so nervous you wo n't even talk to me . DAISY Now what ? RAFE If calling the police is going to make you feel better , I 'll call them and they 'll come over and you can tell them why you ca n't stop screaming . DAISY Oh sure . You 'll call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Hello , police ... ( He hands her the phone ) DAISY ( on the phone ) Is this the police ? ( To RAFE ) You were n't kidding . ( To PHONE ) There is a guy here who just told me he murdered a girl ... Why do you want to know my name , I 'm not the one who ... I do n't know if I know his name , because he lies all the time ... No , I have n't been drinking ... Look , I have n't been drinking very much . ( To RAFE ) He wants me to say my address . RAFE Go ahead . DAISY They 'll come up here if I tell them where I live . RAFE You 're the one who 's scared , Daisy . DAISY ( on the phone ) Look , I live on Yonge Street . But I have to move my house because there 's a car coming . ( DAISY hangs up ) RAFE Why did you do that ? ( DAISY laughs ) The cops ca n't help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DAISY I feel so stupid . p. 43 RAFE You still want me to go ? DAISY I do . Of course I do . RAFE Okay . ( He starts to get his things together , DAISY is miserable ) RAFE Pass me that tape recorder first , okay ? DAISY Why ? RAFE What do you mean " why " ? No wonder you do n't trust me . You do n't trust anybody . If Pope Paul came in here and asked you to hand him the tape recorder , you 'd say " why " . I want to play a tape , that 's all . DAISY Is it you singing ? RAFE Indulge me . DAISY What is it ? RAFE And right after this , I 'm leaving for Lima , Peru . DAISY What 's on tape ? RAFE ( turns on tape recorder ) It 's a birthday present . DAISY On tape ? RAFE Shhhhh ! ( TAPE begins : RAFE sings : Happy birthday , baby That 's all I 've got to say I called you to make sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've been fighting And I know I 've been unkind But I called you on your birthday Just because you 're on my mind RAFE turns the tape off with some satisfaction . He is proud of that song ) p. 44 RAFE I made that tape for a girl who was glad it was her birthday , you know what I mean ? DAISY It 's a very stupid song . RAFE No , it is n't . DAISY I hate country ' n western music . Well , I hate it when they sing through their nose . RAFE You think I sing through my nose ? Oh brother . DAISY You 're about as Nashville as smoked salmon . RAFE What do you want me to be ? ( She reaches for him ) DAISY Rafe ... RAFE Why do n't you kick me out if you think I 'm such a phoney ? DAISY You 're not a phoney . RAFE Is that right ? DAISY Phoney is not the word . ( He kisses her . She kisses him ) RAFE Is that right ? Really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? What 's the good word , Daisy ? ( The word is " crazy " but DAISY does n't care . RAFE is ecstatic . He breaks away from her . He is bouncing off the walls , collecting candles , arranging them on the coffee table ) p. 45 DAISY Rafe ... RAFE Come on , Daisy , it 's your birthday . What are you saving all these candles for ? DAISY It better be better with candles . RAFE We 're going to celebrate , okay ? DAISY We 're going to bed together , that 's all . What 's it supposed to be , Great Moments from the 20th Century ? RAFE You have no sense of occasion . DAISY This is going to be worth waiting for ? Is n't it ? ( RAFE is lighting candles . He seems entranced by the flames ) Because many Great Moments from the 20th Century turned out to be real turkeys . ( DAISY sweeps regally into the bathroom . Her exit is ruined because she has to come back out to turn on the light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her defection ) RAFE Daisy ? ( He knocks on the bathroom door ) Daisy ? ( He rattles the doorknob ) You locked yourself in . ( He races around the room , collecting the telephone book , telephone . He finds Eddie 's number on the phone book cover , dials it ) ( on the telephone ) Hello , Eddie ... Listen my name is Tyrone Power and I 'm trying to rescue a friend of yours . ( DAISY throws open the bathroom door and arranges herself in the doorway wearing a slip . RAFE is too preoccupied to notice , but she looks stunning ) ( on the telephone ) I do n't care if I woke you , fella , because she locked herself in the bathroom and the last girl I know did that was taking sleeping pills . p. 46 DAISY Let me talk to him . ( She takes the phone away ) RAFE ( over-joyed ) Daisy ! DAISY ( on the telephone ) Hello , Eddie ... No , I 'm all right . ( RAFE takes the phone back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... RAFE ( on the telephone ) Eddie ... Let me talk to Sharon ... Well , roll her over and hand her the phone because I want to tell her her friend , her best friend , does not look like a duck ... ( DAISY laughs ) ( on the telephone ) What do you mean I 'm crazy ? ( He laughs and hangs up the phone ) She 's coming over . DAISY Sharon ? RAFE She 'll take Eddie 's car unless he kills her first . DAISY She was fighting with Eddie . RAFE He was fighting with her . DAISY I 'm the one who 's going to get killed . p. 47 RAFE Maybe she is a friend of yours . DAISY ( on the telephone ) Hello , Eddie ... He hung up on me . RAFE So she 's on her way . DAISY She 's going to tear my throat out . RAFE We 'll turn off the lights and pretend we are n't home . DAISY Sharon is going to kill me . ( RAFE is putting out candles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . DAISY laughs . She helps him extinguish candles . It becomes something of a competition in daring and style ) RAFE Hey , do you want to marry me ? ( DAISY laughs ) You think that 's funny ? DAISY Yes . RAFE Why ? ( DAISY laughs . He must be kidding ) Why do you think that 's funny ? ( DAISY wonders ) Let 's get married , okay . ( He takes a ring off DAISY 's finger and puts it on his own ) DAISY Rafe ... RAFE Tyrone Power married Jean Peters . p. 48 DAISY Do you want it like the movies ? ( RAFE grins at her . Of course he does ) In slow motion or what ? ( The room is lit by birthday candles ) RAFE Happy birthday , Daisy . ( He kisses her ) Blow out the candles , okay ? Make a wish . ( He moves her head so she 's facing the birthday cake . There is something frightening about the way he holds her neck . DAISY decides it 's an accident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lit by moonlight . RAFE carries her to bed like Clark Gable carried Vivien Leigh in Gone With The Wind . RIVA puts on yet another disco record which segues into intermission music . Fade-out moonlight ) END OF ACT ONE @x As the lights come up , DAISY is singing in the bathroom . RAFE is accompanying her on the guitar . He has tied one of DAISY 's straight-back chairs to the bathroom door with his belt . DAISY will be able to open the door a little , but she wo n't be able to get into the room . DAISY ( sings ) I said I liked the way you looked I said I liked your style RAFE Hey Daisy ... DAISY ( sings ) And I sat right down beside you Bought a drink and watched you smile RAFE Hey , Daisy ... do you know how often they fly to Lima , Peru ? DAISY ( sings ) You told me you picked a guitar With a country'n western band RAFE Should we phone Air Peru ? Would they tell us ? DAISY ( sings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . RAFE You can put airplane tickets on a credit card , ca n't you ? Hey , Daisy ... where 's your credit card ? ( RAFE is searching through her closets . He finds her wallet in her coat pocket , or her purse if she has one ) p. 50 DAISY The door wo n't open . ( She rattles the handle . RAFE stuffs her wallet in his pocket ) RAFE Hey , Daisy , Nicky 's on the phone . ( This is patently untrue ) DAISY How did you lock the door on that side ? There is n't any lock . RAFE I told him you 're running off with me . I told him you 're going to be a bandit queen , is that okay ? DAISY Let me out of here . RAFE It is okay ? What I told Nicky ? ( He opens the door ) DAISY No , it is n't okay . ( RAFE hands her the phone ) RAFE Call him back . Go on . That 's his number . You wrote it down there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , did he ? Why would Nicky call me at four in the morning ? RAFE I called him . DAISY What ? RAFE I said listen , this is just like on daytime tv , here is Daisy in love with her boss ... p. 51 DAISY What did he say ? RAFE But Daisy is n't on tv . Daisy is real . DAISY What did he say ? RAFE It was like on tv . His wife answered . ( DAISY moans ) I said is this Mrs. Nicky and she said who 's this . You know , some of your friends are n't very friendly . DAISY We are n't friends . Why should we be friends ? RAFE I said you 'd been locked in the bathroom for half an hour with a blow dryer and a bottle of Vitabath but she did n't care . She wanted to tell me what time it was , that 's all . I said who cares . She said at the tone the time will be four thirty eight and ten seconds , beep . At the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seconds , beep . At the tone the time will be ... DAISY Rafe ... RAFE I said you were locked in there ... I told her about Laugh-A-Minute Appleton . And the sleeping pills . I told her to wake Nicky . She hung up on me . DAISY I have to work on Monday . RAFE No , you do n't . DAISY With Nicky . And he hates to fight with his wife . ( RAFE is ranging around the apartment opening drawers and cupboards ) p. 52 RAFE Where do you keep your Christmas stuff ? DAISY I am going to have to fight with Nicky . I am going to have to fight with Sharon . You poured her Vitabath all over me . ( RAFE discovers a box of Christmas lights and tinsel ) RAFE Never mind I found it . DAISY Sharon is going to come in here and demand her Vitabath . ( RAFE is decorating the Christmas tree ) RAFE Tell her to smell you . DAISY Sharon is a very selfish person . RAFE Tell her to take one last deep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't care , Daisy . Look at the Christmas tree . DAISY It does n't take an hour and a half to drive in from Scarborough . ( RAFE plugs in the Christmas tree lights ) DAISY Why is Sharon crawling in from Scarborough ? Why did you lock me in the bathroom ? RAFE Daisy , you are locked into all sorts of things . p. 53 DAISY Why ? RAFE It 's safe in there , is n't it ? It 's secure . It 's a minimal sort of environment but a space you can understand . thoroughly . It 's like a bank job . DAISY Why ? RAFE You know why you 're working in that bank ? So you can suffer every day . Keep your guilty secret from the tellers in the trust department . Daisy loves Nicky but nobody must ever know . DAISY Everybody knows . RAFE I wrote a song about it . DAISY Sure . You locked me in the bathroom and you wrote me a song . RAFE Do n't you want a song about your birthday cake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... RAFE And your TV Guide and your married lover and your future ... DAISY Shut up , Rafe ... RAFE ( Sings ) Daisy I think I 'm crazy I think I 'm crazy I think I 'm crazy I think I 'm crazy I think I 'm crazy I think I 'm crazy I think I 'm crazy ( And he continues to sing . There is no doubt RAFE is prepared to go on all night . He sings like a madman until he 's sure DAISY 's speechless , then he sings to her gently ) I think I 'm crazy over you . p. 54 DAISY Rafe ... RAFE I did n't call Nicky . DAISY I know it . RAFE But I think you should call him . Okay ? Tell him who we are and where we 're going ? Come on , Daisy . Phone him up and tell his wife what time it is . ( DAISY reaches for the phone ) DAISY I 'll disguise my voice , okay ? ( RAFE picks her up and spins her around ) RAFE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lives . DAISY Who told you that , Marshall McLuhan ? ( RAFE pulls DAISY out on the balcony ) RAFE Look over that way . The sun 's going to rise in an hour and a half . DAISY Look down there . RAFE Look up , Daisy . Come on . We 're supposed to stare off to the future . We 're idealistic . DAISY There 's a cop car in the parking lot . RAFE You 're paranoid . DAISY Someone must have called them . Because of the noise . p. 55 RAFE They 're going next door . They 're going to the tenth floor where someone else was murdered . DAISY They 're going to come up here . Say it was the people downstairs who called . They know my apartment number . These cops are going to come up here and knock on the door and they 'll want to come in and they 'll want us to tell them what 's wrong . RAFE Tell them nothing is wrong . DAISY I ca n't go to the door dressed like this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's four in the morning , Daisy . You 're supposed to be in bed . DAISY But they know I screamed . They know , you know , that I do n't know you . RAFE ( Gives up ) Get dressed ... Go on , get dressed and save your reputation . DAISY I do n't want to get dressed . RAFE We wo n't go to the door . DAISY They 'll think I 'm dead . RAFE Are you crazy ? DAISY I was screaming . If I do n't answer the door , they 'll think I 'm dead . p. 56 RAFE You think cops break down doors just because it 's quiet inside ? DAISY If they thought I was getting killed ... RAFE We 'll turn the lights out . ( He does . The room is lit by moonlight ) DAISY They 'll want us to answer , Rafe . RAFE Look , the cops will come up here . They 'll knock on the door . We 'll stay still inside and nothing will happen . They 'll knock , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ downstairs exactly what happened and we 'll be laughing . ( There is a knock on the door ) DAISY That 's them . RAFE Shhhhhh ... ( Pause . DAISY giggles ) Shhhhhh ! DAISY ( whisper ) They wo n't believe it . They wo n't believe everything is quiet and we 've gone to sleep . RAFE ( whisper ) They want to go catch crooks , Daisy . Catch crooks or have coffee . DAISY ( whisper ) Is n't it against the law to scream all night for no reason ? Is n't that disturbing the peace ? p. 57 RAFE Shhhhhh ! DAISY I mean , I could get evicted , could n't I ? ( There is another knock at the door . DAISY giggles ) RAFE Shhh ! DAISY Maybe it 's Sharon . RAFE Does Sharon ride around in a cop car ? DAISY Maybe I was wrong about the cop car . Because the light is different down there , you know , the parking lot has those weird arc lights . How am I supposed to recognize a cop car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know ? RAFE I can recognize a cop car from underneath it . ( There is another knock ) DAISY This is stupid . When somebody knocks , you answer the door , do n't you ? ( She moves for the door . RAFE dives for her and catches her ) RAFE When somebody knocks , you lie there quite still in the dark . DAISY Let me go . RAFE It is n't Sharon at the door . She called back , you know , while you were in the shower . I explained . I told her not to come ... I tried to get you to the phone , but you did n't answer . You know . The shower was running . Kachunga . Kachunga . Kachunga ... Sharon reminds me of a friend of mine , Andy . He 's a con man ... You know how he gets girls to go to bed with him ? ( Whatever efforts DAISY makes to get away , RAFE meets , with as little force as possible ) p. 58 RAFE He tells them sad stories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along without them . He told one girl he had to go to New York to rescue his kid brother . The kid brother had actually killed somebody in the streets of New York but Andy knew he could talk the kid into giving himself up to the police . He 'll say anything . He lies all the time . And the girl believed him . She gave him her credit card to book the airline ticket . ( He takes her wallet out of his pocket and hands it to her ) DAISY You lie all the time . RAFE Not as much as Andy . DAISY You 're a real rat , are n't you ? RAFE I wish I were n't . DAISY Oh sure . RAFE I wish every story I told you was true . I wish everything did n't have to change into garbage at midnight . DAISY Rafe ... RAFE I wish I did n't have to go back to Andy . He cons me . I try to con him . I wish I could stay here with you until all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the time . RAFE The thing about you , Daisy , is I can believe everything that you say . p. 59 DAISY Let me go then . RAFE What ? DAISY You trust me . I 'm like your sister . RAFE ( Rolling away from her ) Sure . Okay . DAISY And we 'll sit here , in the dark , perfectly quietly . And we 'll wait for the cops to go away . ( They have been sitting under the Christmas tree , its lights providing the only illumination in the room . RAFE turns out the Christmas tree lights ) RAFE It 's boring , is n't it ? ( DAISY starts for the door in the dark . RAFE follows her , catches her as she tries to unlock the door . She screams . He switches the light on ) RAFE Trust , Daisy . Friendship . Do you know who your friends are ? Because the cops have gone away . ( He opens the door to show her the hallway . DAISY looks out into the hall ) DAISY ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . RAFE Call them . Call Riva in from next door and she can chaperone . But if we have the cops in here . And Riva . And Sharon . And John Wayne next door . There wo n't be any room for us . Daisy . I mean the springs , they wo n't take it . ( DAISY finds herself locking the door against SHARON 's entrance ) p. 60 DAISY I would hate it if Sharon were here . RAFE Sharon told me her side of the Disney on Parade story . How you never shut up about dancing around for eighteen months with a duck head on her head . How you tell every new guy she meets about the time she made the dog food commercial ... DAISY She did phone . RAFE She left you in my hands . DAISY What ? RAFE She said she was sure I could handle it . She was going to turn around and drive back to bed with Eddie . DAISY Why should I believe you ? RAFE You think I 'm a con man . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ con man . If you want to watch a beautiful con , you want to call Andy . DAISY There is n't any Andy , is there ? RAFE That would be convenient . DAISY I mean , you 're Andy . RAFE That would wrap everything up very neatly . You could call it The Three Faces of Rafe and Joanne Woodward could be in the movie . DAISY Look ... p. 61 RAFE I 'm like Andy . Except he is so into the con , you know , he ca n't do anything else , so some people might say he was sicker than I was . I mean , Andy is what they call impotent and I make love like an Arthur Murray dance teacher . DAISY I guess . RAFE I make love like Genghis Khan and the mongol hordes . DAISY I 'm not going to argue with you . RAFE I make love like it was tax deductible . DAISY You 're all right . Look , you do n't have to worry about it . RAFE I 'm not worried . I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And that 's security , is n't it ? It 's better than a bank clerk . Because we 'll only have banks as long as we have our present economic system . But we 'll always have computers . We might have computers longer than we have people . DAISY What do you do ? Really ? RAFE I look for work . DAISY Of course . You do n't work . RAFE I go down to Canada Manpower and I tell all those little girls with their honours B.A. in English and Psychology , I say , what do you have for me , I do n't play guitar very well , I do not have a useful trade and I can not talk to the latest computers because I do not have recent computer experience . p. 62 DAISY And then what happens ? RAFE They say why is it you do not have recent computer experience and I tell them because I was in prison . DAISY We 're supposed to be friends . RAFE We are friends , Daisy and I was in prison . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Canada Manpower say oh why were you in prison and I say homicide . And then they blink at me for a while . You know how Canada Manpower finds a job for an ex-con axe murderer ? Very carefully . DAISY Rafe ... RAFE They sent me out to a gas station on the Danforth . Can you figure why a computer programmer who also happens to be an ex-murderer should end up pumping gas ? DAISY I want to get dressed . ( She crosses to her closet to change into jeans and a T-shirt ) RAFE After I go to Canada Manpower then I come home and watch tv . That is my main occupation , if you like . I watch all the game shows . I like to watch people winning Jacuzzi whirlpool baths . DAISY You have to ruin everything .
