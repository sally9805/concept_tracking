Paul is a nine-year-old pariah . Schoolmates taunt him , and even his own family has begun to reject him . His offense : he insists on dressing up in his mother 's clothes and playing dolls with his sister rather than joining his brother in outdoor games . His lot is not a happy one , but it is common enough among the patients at a unique psychiatric clinic at U.C.L.A. , the Gender Identity Research Treatment Program . <P> Begun in 1967 by Psychiatrist Richard Green , 37 , to study homosexuality , the program 's current enrollment includes 50 boys between the ages of 4% and ten . All the youngsters are overtly effeminate : many walk with a mince , talk with a lisp and want to be girls . Left untreated , Green believes that most of them would grow up to be homosexuals , if not candidates for transsexual operations . By studying and treating them through adulthood , Green hopes not only to discover why they became effeminate but also to help them handle the hostility they generate among their peers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them to grow into heterosexual relationships . <P> Unlike tomboyish girls , a few of whom Green has also studied , " sissy " boys are quickly marked out for social rejection . All the little boys at the clinic have suffered harassment ; one seven-year-old had his shirt ripped off by classmates who wanted to see if he had female breasts . To ease a boy 's anxiety about being a misfit , Green concentrates on changing his behavior through weekly therapy . Under the direction of a male therapist , the patients are divided into small groups and encouraged to assume traditional male roles in their play . <P> Point System . One result is that the boys often react to one another just the way their outside peers react to them . A five-year-old with a passion for dolls teased a fellow patient who picked up a doll , saying , " That 's sissy stuff . " Because many of the youngsters seem unaware of the way they appear to others , they are shown videotapes of themselves mincing down the hall . <P> Another major @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parents . Green counsels them to criticize consistently their child 's effeminate habits and encourage him to play with boys neither unaggressive nor overly so . He sometimes has the parents use a complicated point system : five points might be awarded for taking the role of father in playing house , for example , five subtracted for wearing a dress . The tally may be kept on a blackboard , and , when a positive total of , say , 30 is reached , the boy will be rewarded with a trip to Disneyland . Conversely , enough demerits might result in the loss of television privileges . The aim of this stern regimen is to prod the boys into masculinity through rewards and penalties .
