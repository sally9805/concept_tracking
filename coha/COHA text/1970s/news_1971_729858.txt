txt Everyone appears determined to put at least a good face on the realignment of currencies completed over the weekend . Americans feel their initiative was more successful than expected in producing an agreement which ends the threat of economic war as well as promising to speed U.S. economic recovery . While France might have preferred a smaller dollar devaluation , it welcomes the agreement as ' fair to all . ' Japanese are turning their prodigious energies When a major industrial nation devalues its currency , the move is usually regarded as an admission of economic weakness . But the Nixon administration , having devalued the U.S. dollar , is wreathed in smiles . The President has gone so far as to say that the international monetary agreement just reached is " the most significant . . . in the history of the world . " His assessment that the overall settlement is , in his eyes , a triumph , arises from several factors ? 1 . The agreement ? by which the dollar is devalued an average of 12 percent against other major currencies ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ float according to supply and demand ) ? virtually ends the danger of economic warfare within the Western alliance . Mr. Nixon 's sweeping assessment probably referred to the fact that the work the Group of Ten has just ended here is the first time the world has seen a multilateral agreement on exchange rates . Willingness to compromise The exchange rate for a nation 's currency is highly important and politically sensitive . Thus the agreement reflects a willingness of the major nations to hammer out a compromise for the sake of economic peace . Somewhat similar efforts before World War II failed . Other postwar devaluations , such as those of the British pound and French franc , weedone unilaterallY , though with some consultation with other nations . 2 . Devaluation of the dollar promises to speed up the domestic economic recovery . This year the United States will suffer a deficit in its trade balance for the first time in decades . Economists say this was a considerable factor in holding down growth of domestic production . On Friday , Dec. 17 , Peter G. Peterson , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told a small group of reporters that a devaluation of 11 percent against the other major currencies could have the effect of creating 500,000 to 750,000 jobs over two years . This would reduce the unemployment rate by 0.6 to 0.9 percent . With the jobless rate now at 6 percent of AP photo U.S. negotiator Secretary Connally -- a triumph ? the labor force , even half of that additional job growth by the fall of 1972 would cheer President Nixon 's reelection prospects . 3 . The United States won very substantial revaluations from its trading partners ? considerably larger than would have been thought likely on Aug. 15 when President Nixon suspended entirely the gold convertibility of the dollar . ( Convertibility remains suspended. ) // * Devaluation with a smile // Japan has agreed to fix a new rate for the yen of 308 to the dollar , meaning an upward revaluation from the old par rate against the dollar of 16.8 percent , After the Aug. 15 speech , Japan tried to prevent any revaluation of its currency . The West German mark **34;657;TOOLONG percent and against - the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ French franc will be unchanged in terms of gold . But that means an upward revaluation against the dollar of 8.57 percent  --  the same amount as the U.S. dollar has been devalued against gold . The Italian lira and Swedish krone will have small devaluations of 1 and 1.5 percent . They will still be upgraded , however , in dollar terms . Swiss , Dutch , Belgians . Switzerland will revalue its , franc against gold by a further 7 percent . It boosted the franc previously only last spring . The Dutch will increase the value of the guilder 3 percent against gold , and more against the dollar . The Belgians will hike their franc 2 percent against gold , and 11.5 percent against the U.S. dollar . ( The President will ask Congress for a devaluation of the dollar against gold from $35 per troy ounce to $38 . That is 8.57 percent . ( This Congressional procedure is the " trump card " the United States still holds to ensure that bargaining continues for trade concessions in talks over the next few weeks . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anticipated this weekend 's currency realignment . The price of the German mark , for instance , will need hardly any increase . Surtax to be dropped Other currencies , such as the Japanese yen , the French franc , and the British pound , still have some adjustments to make . In return for the currency revaluation , the United States will this week drop the 10 percent surtax on imports and the " buy American " provision of the 7 percent investment-tax credit . The Group of Ten also agreed " promptly " to consider long-term reform of the international monetary system . This would be done within the " framework " of the International Monetary Fund Pending such reform , the Ten decided to permit more price flexibility in the trading of currencies . They will be allowed to trade with margins of 2.25 percent on each side of parity , as against 1 percent under the old rule . Further , the European Community agreed to establish an " appropriate agen- da " for considering basic trade issues . This could develop into what administration of . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Nixon round ' coming ? Treasury Secretary John B. Connally Jr guessed that long-term monetary reform would take a year or longer to resolve . ? **27;693;TOOLONG to reduce trade barriers-would take-even-longer. -  - -  Within both monetary and trade areas , there remain many sticky issues that will require hard bargaining ' before solutions can be reached . Early reaction among economists and businessmen in this country and elsewhere indicate great satisfaction with the agreement on exchange-rate realignment . Who won , who lost ? ' Mr. Nixon , in his brief announcement to the press , asked rhetorically : " Who won , who lost ? " " The answer is , " he said , " when agreements are reached in which all parties bargain hard and fight hard for their positions , when that agreement is mutually reached , then it is an agreement which is to the mutual benefit of both . " What has happened here is that the whole free world has won . . . "                   @ @
