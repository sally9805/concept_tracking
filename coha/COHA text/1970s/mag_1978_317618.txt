A strategy fails , and the Senate blocks the labor reform bill <P> The nation 's labor unions have been dwindling in recent years in both membership and political clout . But they mustered all the lobbying power they could behind the Labor Reform Act of 1978 . Pressured by AFL-CIO Boss George Meany , President Carter gave the bill forceful , if not all-out , support . But businessmen , large and small , rallied strong opposition , arguing that the bill would put them at a disadvantage with Big Labor and lead to a wave of organizing , particularly in the South , where unions have been weak . Last week , after the bill had been stalled for 19 days by a filibuster , labor 's forces suddenly lost , at least for now , in a showdown on the Senate floor . <P> The bill would have made union organizing easier by simplifying the enforcement of existing labor-relations laws . A key provision would have given any worker fired for union recruiting-such firings are already banned by law-time and a half in back pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ normal retroactive pay . Another provision would require that elections among employees on whether to form unions be held in at least 35 days ; current law specifies 45 days . <P> During the fight , the Senators were inundated by millions of letters , postcards and phone calls from both sides . Teams of labor lobbyists roamed the Capitol Hill corridors . Business supporters papered the Hill with statements , studies , polls and visits from small businessmen . <P> All along , the Administration and Senate Democratic leaders were confident that they had a firm majority of votes for passage of the bill . But they were not certain they could enlist the 60 votes needed to cut off the filibuster led by Republican Senators Richard Lugar of Indiana and Orrin Hatch of Utah . Lugar argued that owners of small businesses are " overtaxed and overregulated " and had a legitimate fear of a " further extension of union organizing power and of a strengthened National Labor Relations Board . " He had helped prepare 1,200 amendments that could have come up for votes , one by one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Senate majority leader , Robert Byrd , repeatedly called for cloture votes to end debate . Through five such roll calls , the antifilibuster support slowly mounted from 42 to 58 . Last week Byrd was ready with a plan to reach the magic 60 votes on the sixth attempt . <P> Byrd knew he had 58 votes . He hoped that he could persuade Alabama Democrat John Sparkman to cast the 60th vote if the 59th could be secured . Byrd had acquired a pledge of that vote from Louisiana Democrat Russell Long , who would switch from his pro-filibuster stand if , among other things , the bill were amended to outlaw labor 's use of " stranger " pickets , workers from one plant who join picket lines at another . Byrd planned to send the bill back to the Human Resources Committee to add the Long provision .
