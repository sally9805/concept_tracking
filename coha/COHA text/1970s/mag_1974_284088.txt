The illegality of hiring practices based on race or sex has been so etched into the national consciousness that the phrase " equal opportunity employer ( M/F ) " needs no explanation to anyone who reads help-wanted ads . Many fewer people realize that there also is a six-year-old federal law against age bias in employment ; among other things , it provides that workers aged 40 to 65 can be fired only for deficient performance or other good cause .

Labor Secretary Peter Brennan , 56 , hailed the scope of the settlement , which covers workers in eight Western states whose former jobs ranged from assistant service-station manager to executives ; some earned about $40,000 a year . Individual awards to the employees will run from just under $10,000 to more than $50,000 . Those figures , said Brennan , show that age bias will cost employers heavily in cash as well as wasted talent .
