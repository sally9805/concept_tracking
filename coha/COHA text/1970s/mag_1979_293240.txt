MADE IN AMERICA <P> by Peter Maas <P> Viking ; 347 pages ; $10.95 <P> Made in America seems at first blush an odd title for a novel about the Mafia , but Peter Maas should be forgiven his irony . Sicily 's best-known export has , of course , become as American as frozen pizza . As Maas has shown in The Valachi Papers and Serpico , Cosa Nostra reaches far below the imperial realms of The Godfather into virtually every working-class neighborhood where cash is short and the Mob 's loan sharks cruise . <P> The all-American slob-hero of Maas ' book is Richie Flynn , 33 , a poor Irish boy from Manhattan who had a flurry of fame as a New York Giants ' running back eleven years earlier . Though still honored on the saloon beat , where he peddles Goldblatt beer , Flynn has gnawing dreams of recaptured affluence . His road to riches is outlined for him by a city hall insider , who shows the ex-jock how he can buy a building condemned by the city and lease it back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Richie needs is title to an abandoned synagogue in the South Bronx : for $50,000 ( $10,000 down ) , he will be able to unload the building on the city for $125,000 a year for 15 years . Until this kind of scam was exposed a few years ago , it was almost as lucrative as a card-carrying membership in OPEC . <P> To get his down payment , Richie must go to the Mafia , where he is quickly impaled on the meat hooks of 243-lb . Albert ( " King Kong " ) Karpstein , a.k.a . The Animal , a.k.a . Milky , for his diet of Milky Way chocolate bars . A part-time enforcer for Joe Hobo , a.k.a . Joe Hoboken , a.k.a . Joseph lacovelli , the simian Karpstein is a semidemented Jew whose appeal to his Italian bosses lies in the imagination and diligence he brings to his work . He would as soon see his creditors default as pay , for the added diversion of carving them up . But Milky is also an independent Shylock , one of the biggest and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sure , he can advance Flynn $12,500 for 30 days in return for $20,000 in on-the-dot weekly payments . <P> In his euphoria , Richie acquires a one-seventh part of an expensive call girl and recovers some of the old Giants swagger . Inevitably his deal with the city dies , and Richie faces a similar fate at the hands of King Kong . Flynn is saved temporarily because of a minor Mafia dispute . A more permanent salvation is offered by the FBI and an ambitious new special prosecutor , Hamilton Wainwright IV , who has vowed to rip out the " cancer " of organized crime . They want Richie to sing . <P> Author Maas ' novel is a comedy of terrors that is all the more absorbing because of the methods used by both sides : the law bending the law , the mob making a farce of it . The area 's top don , whom Wainwright is out to get despite his non-involvement in the case , roves free as a boccie ball . King Kong , among others , is appropriately retired by his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little wealthier and healthier , though back to selling booze .
