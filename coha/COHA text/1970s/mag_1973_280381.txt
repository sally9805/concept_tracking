Computers , said an official Soviet encyclopedia in 1955 , are part of a " capitalist ploy used for increasing the exploitation of the working class by creating artificial redundancy and also loosening the revolutionary tie between the worker and the means of production . " Times have changed . The Soviet Union is now rushing to wire its economy up to the computer , and the great bleep forward could open up enormous trade opportunities for Western computer firms . <P> The current five-year plan calls for investing more than $4 billion in computer technology-six times the amount in the last plan . By 1975 , the Soviets aim to increase their stock of high-speed computers from about 7,000 to some 22,000 . Even if that goal is met , the U.S.S.R. will have only about one-sixth as many of the machines as the U.S. has today . This year , the Soviets introduced a series of sophisticated computers called the Riad ( Row ) System , the first entirely new line since 1964 . The Riad models are about the equal of the IBM System/360 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , editor of the Rand Corp . ' s Soviet Cybernetics Review : " The Soviet computer industry has always been a shambles . " <P> Compared with Western models . Soviet computers tend to be slower , less reliable , and have less extensive memories . Russia 's most widely used model still in production , the Minsk-32 , can perform 100,000 operations a second and has a memory that accommodates 30,000 " bytes , " or items of information . By contrast , the IBM System/370-135 can do 500,000 operations a second and retain up to 246,000 bytes . Only about 10% of Soviet computers are so-called third-generation , integrated-circuit models , and many are first-generation contraptions that use vacuum tubes , which were phased out in U.S. computers more than a decade ago . Soviet peripheral equipment and programming are also far cruder than in the West . <P> Why has the U.S.S.R. been so slow to computerize ? The Soviets are adept at performing technological spectaculars-like orbiting a Sputnik-but inept at quality mass production and mass distribution . Computer Scientist Allen Reiter , who interviewed some 100 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " The Soviet mainframe industry is characterized by disjointedness . One plant keeps its work secret from another plant , and they come out with incompatible products . " They are also weak on service . The Minsk enterprise , Russia 's largest computer maker , began servicing its products only in 1970 ; before then , customers had to train their own maintenance men . Soviet managers still have little understanding of computers . Says the Rand Corp . ' s Holland : " Factory managers think that all they have to do is plug them in like an electric fan . " <P> Think Big . To meet their new goals , the Soviets may well have to buy much more Western equipment or even allow Western firms to set up plants there . The Soviets have bought about 100 Western computers , 21 of them from Britain 's International Computers Ltd . But the Russians are beginning to prefer U.S. gear to European machines ; they feel that American computer makers think on the same large scale as they do and have the technology to implement their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
