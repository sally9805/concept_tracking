txt THE FEDERAL government late Friday night denied a renewed request of the Chicago , Rock Island &; Pacific Railroad for a $100 million loan which company officials said was vital to nrevent a shutdown . The action was taken at an emergency meeting in Washington of directors of the United States Railway Association . It was followed by a call from John Ingram , Rock Island president , for an emergency meeting of the railroad 's directors at 10 a.m . Monday to decide the fate of the carrier . In Chicago , John Mitros , vice president of staff for the railroad , said the denial means the Rock Island will shut down . " There is no way known to me railroad can go on , " said Mitros , scribed the decision as a shock . HE SAID THE Rock Island will run " as long as there 's money to buy fuel and pay wages , " but he declined to speculate on when the railroad might shut down . He said , however , he expected it to remain in operation at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the railway association said the Interstate Commerce Commission " would insure the continued operation of Rock Island services " in event of a shutdown . He made the statement in announcing the loan denial . The spokesman said George Stafford , chairman of the ICC , has the power to order other railroads to take over Rock Island services under the Regional Rail Reorranizatinn AA of 1973 . He said Stafford had been conferring over the phone during the week with executives of 15 other railroads relative to such a - takeover . The USRA directors were convened into the emergency session late Friday after Ingram A federal investigation of Amtrak is causing a decline in rail passengers and requests for refunds . The Amtrak president asked that hearings be suspended to avoid ' ' negative implications . " Page 2. and other railroad executives warned that the Rock Island had only sufficient money to last thru Wednesday at the latest . THE ASSOCIATION FIRST rebuffed the railroad on Feb. 26 . Its board said that quick funds would not easily help the line 's financial plight , and that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formed under the 1973 act to administer a loan program to aid financially ailing railroads . The association also turned down a last-ditch request of the Rock Island for a $10 million loan to meet requirements in the next two months . Of the overall $100 million application , $30 million was sought for operations thruout this year and $70 million for the subsequent three years . STAFFORD . a member of the USRA board as well as ICC chairman , urged the board to reconsider the earlier rejection . He said the loan would be far less expensive to the federal treasury than if the ICC were forced  --  as the Department of Transportation advocates  --  to require other railroads to take over Rock Island service , using the road 's track , equipment , andmanpower . MITROS said in Chicago the Rock Island " obviously expected to get the loan . " It 's kind of futile to talk about it , but in my - view nur pLebeniation demonstrated beyond any reasonable doubt that the railroad is fully capable of restructuring its routes , affairs , and management to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said . Mitros said the railroad 's financial position was very precarious . He said that during the last year the ICC rejected a rate increase request , unions won a 10 per cent wage increase , ridership fell off 20 per cent , and the cost of vital materials rose 14 to 15 per cent because of inflation .
