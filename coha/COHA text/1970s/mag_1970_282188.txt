When a multimillion-dollar Vatican building program reaches completion next winter , it will add a boldly modern look to the city 's architecture , as well as to a few Roman Catholic traditions . Chief among these is the peculiar spectacle known as the Pope 's general audience . Since its beginning during the first decade of the 20th century , this event has usually taken place in St. Peter 's Basilica , a resplendent setting that is unfortunately characterized by slushy acoustics and poor visibility . Centerpiece of the current Vatican construction is a sleek new papal audience hall designed by Pier Luigi Nervi , with well-planned , air-conditioned facilities for 14,000 pilgrims . Once it goes into use , the atmospheric old St. Peter 's audiences will fade forever . Last week TIME 'S Rome Bureau Chief Jim Bell revisited one to savor the sights and sounds - and smells-for the last time . His report : <P> " You mean we 're supposed to applaud ?

Hence a battle for position goes on . And it is difficult to appreciate the glory of Michelangelo and Bernini when some child is whacking your shins , a woman has her pocketbook jammed into your floating rib and half a dozen nuns are giving you the old high-low so the mother superior can better enjoy this supreme moment . <P> Herded Sheep . They start gathering in St. Peter 's Square as the sun comes over the magnificent Bernini colonnade - black suits and neckties , Bermuda shorts and T shirts , miniskirts barely covering buttocks , long-sleeved dresses with mantillas . In long lines before wooden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lean wearily on crutches . A roar of protest in a dozen languages goes up as a middle-aged American with a red face tries an end run . He is spat on as he retreats , his wife near tears . <P> When the barriers go down and the bronze doors of St. Peter 's part , people are herded like stray sheep into pens on both sides of the central nave . Outside , a few holders of blue tickets are ushered along niches and cornices of pitted travertine marble through a side entrance and into box seats from which they can observe , with slightly arched nostrils , the antics below .
