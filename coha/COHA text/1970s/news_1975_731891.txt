" Dr. Burns was said to have argued that the tax bill would put the Federal Reserve Board ' in , an untenable position as a re4 sult of the huge Federal deficit ; from the massive tax reduction . I If the Federal Reserve decided to finance the deficit by rapidly expanding the supply of money , it would touch off la new round of serious inflation ; at least by 1977 and perhaps by next year , according to Dr. Burns 's argument . But if the board declined to finance the deficit in this manner , interest rates would climb quickly and substantially , making it diffi ' cult for businesses and homebuyers to get loans and perhaps aborting the recovery from the recession , in the view attributed to Dr. Burns . Simon 's Opposition Mr. Simon was also said to 4 have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opposed to the tax cut itself . He reportedly told : the President that he agreed with those who said the big tax cut would support the re/ covery of the economy , making the recovery more certain and stronger . But he also was said to have argued that the economy would recover even without the massive tax reduction . In the meantime , he reportedly warned , many of the provisions of the bill were very unwise and might become permanently embedded in the tax structure . He was said to have told Mr. Ford that some of the provisions passed by Congress , .. such as the special Social Security payment , were merely new forms of welfare . . .

Many of thdm had serious reservations of the kind President Ford himself expressed about the legislation when he announced his decision last Saturday night .

Meanwhile , in this view , weeks or months could pass before a new bill enabled a tax rebate to go out to American families and the recovery would be slowed at great cost to the country .
