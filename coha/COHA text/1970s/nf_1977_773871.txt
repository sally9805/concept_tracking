txt 80 Introduction treatment subsequent to their healing ritual . Such treatment was regarded as being of secondary importance , and in fact not contributory to their healing . Half of the subjects reported instantaneous healing , whereas the other half reported gradual healing . However , in both instances this was not based on the subject 's observed disappearance of symptoms . Instead , he or she asserted that he or she had been healed , regardless of the state of the symptoms . Thus , the instantaneous healings often occurred in the face of a history that demonstrated continuing symptoms after the instantaneous healing , while the gradual healings were described in terms of being healed with the persistence of symptoms that were " left over " and would now take some time to disappear . This interesting observation was obtained by asking the subjects to describe carefully the time sequence and changes in symptomatology before inquiring about their faith healing . It became apparent through this device that the subjects ' perception of healing was related to their participation in a healing ritual , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long-term residual symptoms , 57 healings left no residual symptoms , 6 minimal symptoms , 7 moderate symptoms , and 1 with severe symptoms . No correlation was found between initial severity of illness and severity of residual symptoms ; between severity of illness and medical treatment received ; between medical treatment received and residual symptoms ; or between any of the above and instantaneous or gradual healing . Attitudes Toward Physicians and Medical Treatment Subjects were asked about their use of medical treatment and their attitudes toward physicians and scientific medicine . The subjects uniformly voiced no disapproval of physicians or the practice of scientific medicine . As noted above , the majority had consulted physicians for diagnositic purposes , and many had obtained occasional or continuous treatment for the conditions that were " faith healed . " These latter subjects continued medical treatment many times after they had received their faith healing . Almost all the subjects had consulted physicians for medical treatment for conditions both before and after the faith healing . The subjects viewed physicians as " useful and necessary ; given to us by God . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would first seek faith healing . However , if that did not result in a cure , they would then , without reluctance , seek the help of a physician and follow the prescribed treatment . Indeed , many had done so since their faith healing . Religion , Faith and Healing 81 Development of Alternate Symptoms Each subject was asked a systematic medical history of illnesses , treatment , and a review of systems . Although there were a number of minor intercurrent complaints , we were unable to elicit any instances of suspected or manifest alternation of either organic or psychological symptoms . Effects of Faith Healing on Life-style Each respondent was asked initially to describe his or her own emotional functioning , work functioning , and relationships with people prior to the faith healing . Then each subject was asked to describe his or her life-style in each of the above areas after the faith healing . And , finally , each subject was asked to describe changes in each area after the faith healing . No change was reported by our subjects , using either the indirect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The subjects reported that their lives , work , and social relationships had always been serene and comfortable . Rarely were personal or interpersonal conflicts reported . In retrospect , even their illnesses , for which they had sought faith healing , were not seen as seriously disruptive events in their lives . Their faith healing was not seen as particularly significant , nor an eventful occurrence in their lives , but almost an expected event . Thus , their faith healing was no watershed that changed their lives . On the other hand , a number of subjects who had been " born again " in adult life did report that their lives had been disturbed prior to their religious conversion , but subsequent to their religious commitment life had become peaceful and satisfying . The subjects were also questioned regarding changes in religious behavior subsequent to their faith healing . As before , there was no change in church attendance , private devotions , Bible reading , or religious interest . However , there was one major change noted by all respondents . All reported that their certainty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ markedly increased after their faith healing experiences . Personality Status Personality status was first assessed by the Spitzer Mental Status Schedule and by a clinical rating scale in which the interviewer rated each subject on self-reports of : 1 ) level of energy , 2 ) worry , 3 ) anxiety , 4 ) 82 Introduction restlessness , 5 ) depression , and 6 ) anger . The scores on both methods of rating were uniformly very low . The subjects reported themselves as having high energy and rarely experiencing worry , anxiety , restlessness , depression , or anger . The standard attitude expressed was that " God can take care of everything , " and since they had placed their trust in God there was little about which to be concerned or to get upset . Adverse emotional experiences were seen as " works of the devil . " Hence , devout religious persons , such as themselves , would not experience such adverse feelings so long as they lived in the proper religious manner . In contradistinction to the self-reports , the interviewer noted manifestations of anger , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the interviews . However , the subjects would deny or minimize these emotions when questioned . It appeared that they wished to see themselves and present themselves in a uniformly good light . On the Cornell Medical Index , the scores fell within normal group norms . But on the psychiatric items checked , both men and women were significantly on the low side of " normal " population norms . The number of illness symptoms checked can be seen asa measure of personal adjustment reflecting perception of self as a psychological failure or a psychological success . In this instance , the uniformly low scores on the CMI suggest that this population viewed themselves as psychological successes . It should be noted that three men and six women fell outside the " normal " group norm ranges . These subjects also did not deny untoward emotional reactions , and reported disruptive personal and interpersonal experiences . Although these persons had experienced faith healing and perceived faith healing in a fashion similar to the other subjects , they readily acknowledged difficulties in life with which they were unable to cope . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used , but were not as effective as for the majority of the subjects . On the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory , a relatively uniform pattern was found , with no statistical difference between male and female scores . After statistical analysis of the MMPI scores , it was found that there was minimal deviation among subjects , thus making it appropriate to construct a composite MMPI profile for the entire group of subjects . The MMPI results corroborate and extend the prior impressions . There is intent to present a good impression of oneself in a highly socially acceptable manner . Yet there is great defensiveness against psychological weakness , a defensiveness that verges upon deliberate distortion in Religion , Faith and Healing 83 the " good " direction ; there is reliance on repression and denial of emo-tional difficulties . This profile implies " an overcompensating rejection of the possibility that the subject is capable of being neurotic . .. the subject tends to overstate his condition in the direction of saying that he does not tire easily , does not get depressed , that life about him is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he should be grateful for what the world offers him . " This aptly sums up exactly how our subjects described themselves in the clinical interview . Further , it suggests that these subjects rely on specific somatic complaints as a method of express-ing discomfort , rather than on emotional complaints that are repressed . We can summarize the MMPI profile as follows : They are affiliative , constrictedly overconventional people . These individuals show prominently in their relations with others an exagger-ated striving to be liked and accepted . Characteristically , they maintain an unassailable optimism and emphasize harmony with others , if neces-sary at the expense of internal values and principles . They are likely to become extremely uncomfortable in , and therefore to avoid , situations demanding angry responses , independent decisions , or the exercise of power . When such persons do end up in the clinic , which is infrequent , they are most resistant to considering that their difficulties may result from emotional conflict . It is also a remarkable fact that even in the face of catastrophic failure , they often resolutely maintain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem to be intolerable to these people . Summation of Data A high degree of congruence has been demonstrated from the history of life-style , religious belief and behavior , clinical interview observations , subjects ' self-reports , and psychometric analyses . These subjects present psychological characteristics indicative of a strong need for social acceptance and social affiliation . This exaggerated need , along with the extensive use of denial and repression as major coping mechanisms , is so pervasive that major disruptive events in their lives are ignored and interpreted as part of a normal , smooth , unruffled existence . These psychological characteristics are consistent with the fact that these subjects do not perceive of illness as a major disruptive event , nor do they perceive their faith healing as a major life enhancing event . Further , these psychological characteristics explain why the subjects perceive of their faith healing as a definite occurrence regardless of presence or absence of symptoms , and regardless of persisting symptoms , and with concomitant medical treatment . 84 Introduction Further , it is not surprising that no evidence for symptom alternation is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ illnesses as conflictual events . Thus , in a sense , their faith healing does not remove their symptoms . Remission of symptoms does not significantly affect their psychic balance of defenses , and , therefore , emergence of alternate symptoms is not required to maintain psychic equilibrium . The issue of whether the subject actually achieved symptom relief or remission of organic symptomatology was not investigated , since there is ample evidence from psycho physiologic research to provide explanations for perceived and actual change in illness . From the subjects ' point of view , relief of symptoms is really a tangential issue . For them , faith healing reaffirms their belief system and their style of life . Faith healing serves to buttress their psychological life-style . From a scientific medical point of view , the question usually asked of faith healing is " does it cure the disease ? " But that is not the question asked by the prospective applicant for faith healing . His or her question is , " Am 1 living in the right way ? " Thus , faith healing is not an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exercise in the treatment of life-style . MEDICINE OR FAITH ? From early on in the twentieth century , illness and healing have been seen in America solely from the view of scientific medicine . Therefore , faith healing has been viewed as an anachronistic throwback to a prescientific era of thought . From this position , scientific healing and faith healing would be seen as competitive . However , in our study we found that these two methods of healing were not competitive but complementary . The same situation has been shown to occur in various studies on folk healing in societies that are undergoing rapid scientific acculturation ( Mischel 1959 ; Nash 1967 ) . In these social settings , both types of healers are used by the populace but for different reasons . When a personal problem is perceived by the patient as due to a condition culturally defined as impersonal , such as a germ or accident , then the patient seeks treatment from a scientific healer . However , when a problem is perceived by the patient as due to a condition culturally defined as due @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeks a religious healer . The reason is logical , for the religious healer is a healer not of specific things but of the whole person . Further , such sickness is sin , and , therefore , the problem is religious and the cure is religious . The problem then is not the condition but what caused the condition . Therefore , one seeks either a scientific healer or a religious healer , not in terms of the condition but the cause . One might casually assume that all people in contemporary America share a common scientific view of the world and the medical scientific view of the cause of disease . But this is certainly not true for the population of people in our study . Illness and emotional distress are not viewed in scientific terms but in religious terms ( Havens 1961 ; Nunn 1964 ; Nunn , Kosa , Alpert 1968 ) . Thus , as our respondents told us , depression , anger , emotional imperfections , even memory lapses , and especially physical disease are not expected occurrences in life . Rather , they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of personal error and sin . Therefore , it is quite logical within this world view to not seek the help of a scientific healer , but rather to seek religious healing for being a bad person . This ethos is expressed by various charismatic faith healers , such as Oral Roberts or Kathryn Kuhlman , who inform their audiences that God does not intend for any of his children to be ill . If you are sick , you need to confess your sins and make yourself right with God , and then you will be healed . The results of this research , if taken in isolation , might lead to the conclusion that our subjects participated in faith healing ritual and experienced faith healing solely because of the life-style , which might be labeled neurotic . Such a view , however , is ethnocentric . Within the world view of our faith healing subjects , their life-style and means of coping with emotions and interpersonal behavior are defined by their religious culture . Faith healing in their world is not aberrant behavior , nor can it be considered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ healing is a culturally defined and sanctioned method for getting right with oneself and one 's world to continue living in a functional manner . In conclusion , to understand the meaning and function of faith healing in the lives of our subjects , we have been led to understand their view of life , their religious culture , and the manner in which it defines patterns of health and illness . Within this cultural context , faith healing is neither illogical nor irrational . Rather , it is an acceptable and appropriate method of dealing with the perceived causes of their illness . SUMMARY In this chapter we have examined the uses of religion in response to illness , dying , and death . Religion may be peripheral in one 's life , and , if so , religion will doubtless be peripheral in facing dying and death . On the 86 Introduction other hand , if religion is a central dimension of one 's life , it may play a critical role in one 's approach to death and dying . When religion is central , it may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ positive uses of religion in Chapter 5 and in this chapter . Yet we must not neglect the fact that a religious person may use his or her religion negatively , just as Job was tempted to curse God for his fate . For example , a young mother was confronted with her young child dying of leukemia . She blamed God for this illness . Yet she asked her minister to stay with them when the child lay dying . Just after the child died , she began to scream curses at God ' , and turned to beat on the hapless pastor who represented God to her . Finally , we should be aware of " foxhole religion . " I have in mind those people who frantically search for some magical solution to the problem of dying . They search out each new cure , each new diet , each new healer , each new faith . In this instance , we do not have faith but merely the disheartening and fruitless search for a remedy that can not be found . In conclusion , we have looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem imponderable . Life is more than cold rationality . We are flesh and blood beings . " And now abideth faith , hope , and love . " An Interview with a Dying Mother E. Mansell Pattison Now that we have taken an overview of the general principles involved in the dying process , it is time to take a closer personal look at specific examples . To introduce this detailed examination , I shall present a verbatim conversation I had with a dying woman . I invite the reader to examine carefully how the patient is coping with dying , and how I cope with the same . This is not a perfect model of how to talk with a dying person . Rather , I want to share this interview because it clearly reveals how two people actually talk , feel , and interact . INTERVIEW D = Dr. Pattison P = 28-year-old mother Location : Medical ward of a hospital D : Hello , I do n't think I 've met you before . I 'm a psychiatrist here in the hospital . I understand your doctor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning . D : This morning ? He talked with you about the purpose of our interview today ? P : He said something about medical histories . D : Yes . We 're trying to teach medical students how an illness develops in a person ; how you deal with an illness ; what you do when a sickness hits you . P : Yes . ( flat ) D : You 've been , I guess , sick now for what , six months or more ? P : Well , most of the last year . 89 90 Introduction D : Most of the year ? P : Yeah . D : How did it start ? P : Ah , with bronchitis , with a bad case of bronchitis . D : Uh um . P : In January . D : In January ? That would be January of 69 or 70 ? P : Oh just this last year . This is 71 ( both ; laugh ) D : So this has gone on for an entire year , and your symptoms started with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's happened since then ? P : ( pause ) Oh , 1 had a lot of chest pain , waking up at night . I ca n't sleep with the pain . ( clears throat ) And 1 came into the hospital in August , and they ran a few tests on me , about 100,000 . D : A hundred thousand tests ! ( both laugh ) P : At least . ( pause ) 1 know it 's that many X rays , but ( pause 15 seconds ) I just kept getting sicker and sicker . D : Were they doing any treatment , or just running tests ? P : Oh treatment . 1 had an operation and I had radiation therapy . D : Uh hum . P : And a lot more X rays , to see what was happening . I had trouble with my heart . D : You had trouble with your heart ? P : Uh huh . D : And this was a heart operation that they did ? P : Yes , it was a pericardial drainage . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cause I had fluid around my heart and the sack . D : You 're getting to learn all the right medical terms , are n't you ? P : I do n't know , just what they tell me. ( laughs ) D : Right ! ( both laugh ) D : So they found out what the trouble was with your heart ? P : Well , the technical term , ah , ah , angiosarcoma . D : Angiosarcoma ? P : Of the heart D : Uh-hum , it 's been a while as a psychiatrist since I 've looked all those things up in a textbook . P : 1 looked it up in the dictionary to see , it 's cancer of the blood vessels of the heart . D : Cancer of the blood vessels of the heart ? P : That 's what the dictionary says . D : Uh-hum . P : That 's all I could gather , I have n't had a doctor actually explain it to me , ... ( pause ) ... in detail what 's been wrong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sick , and ( pause ) for a long , long time , and I could n't stand up . D : You walked in here today , I noticed ! P : Yeah . An Interview with a Dying Mother 91 D : A little bit shaky , but not too bad . P : Well , ( clears throat ) the last time I was in the hospital , when they were finished with me , I could n't get up . I was real dizzy when I would stand tip . And I went home even though I was dizzy , and I stayed in bed at home . I could barely make it into the bathroom . Then I was in bed for a month and a half . D : And then you were able to get up and walk around ? P : Then after a while I could , and I was allright , and I would do a little bit of work around the house . But then , a couple of weeks ago , well ah , this cold weather has really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? P : I started having trouble breathing . D : I noticed . You know , you do n't have to talk real fast . I see that you are breathing a little bit rapidly , and I do n't know if this is your regular breathing rate or you 're a little bit anxious ? P : No ! It 's usually worse than this , really . I 'm breathing kind of easy right now . D : Is that right ? You feel pretty comfortable right now , or ? ( pause ) a little hit on edge ? P : Yeah . ( giggle ) D : I was on edge too , the first time I was on television . P : ( giggle ) D : I could n't recognize myself . ( both laugh ) D : But to come back to this problem you have with your heart ; you say that the doctors have been giving you treatment for the angiosarcoma . P : Radiation therapy for about five weeks . D : Uh-hum . P : And they stopped that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ P : And , ah , they 've been talking , my doctor ( pause 15 seconds ) has been talking to me about taking a drug , but he is n't at this hospital anymore . He 's at Veterans Administration Hospital now . And he was going to call another doctor , Dr. Smith , but I did n't talk to Dr. Smith before I came in. ( pause ) I talked to him on Wednesday , and I told him that I did n't want to come in the hospital ( nervous giggle ) because , ah , ( nervous laugh ) I really did n't . D : Why was that , you did n't want to come in the hospital ? P : I just do n't like hospitals . I 'm just prejudiced , I guess . ( nervous laugh ) D : You 're entitled to a little bit of prejudice after a whole year of it , are n't you ? P : Oh , needles , and ? well , here I am again . I just could n't do anything at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worse and worse and the cough ( pause ) . D : So it sounds like things have been a little bit up and down in the last year since you first got sick , and in the last few months it 's been a pretty handicapping disease for you . P : Yeah , I have n't been able to get around hardly at all . D : Hardly at all ? And you say that although the doctors told you what this was , this angiosarcoma ? 92 Introduction P : They did n't tell me . I read it on the hospital admission slip . D : Oh , you did ? P : ( laughs ) D : You 're one of those kind ? P : ( nervous laugh ) ... I was curious . D : That 's right . Then nobody told you or you did n't ask anybody , or ( pause ) I was kidding , you know , about being sneaky , because sometimes that 's the only way you find out things . P : I do n't know . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I knew I was sick ? ahvery sick , and .. . D : What were you afraid of ? P : Lots ! Somebody asks what 's wrong with you and tells you you 're going to drop dead , you know . ( pause ) All they will tell you is there 's always hope , ( nervous laugh ) I guess . D : That is a question . How do you have hope when you have a very serious disease . P : Faith . D : Faith ? P : Faith in God . D : Has that played a role in your thinking about your disease and your future ? P : ( pause 10 seconds ) Well , it plays a role in all my life . D : It does . How does it work ? Can you tell me about it ? P : It 's just ah ( nervous laugh ) you do what you have to do , that 's all . Ah ? I mean , ( pause ) if I 'm sick , you know , if the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... if they can they will . D : So , you 're coming to the hospital now again to get more treatment ? P : Well , I was thinking of taking this drug . D : And you 're hoping that taking the drug will help ? P : Yes . D : So , when you say that you have some hope that drugs and the treatment will help , I guess you are thinking about how am I going to have faith in possible treatment , but , yet , how do I also deal with the fact that I 've got a pretty serious disease ? I 've got to make some plans for my life . P : Yeah , I guess so . ( very low voice ) D : Have the doctors talked with you at all about plans for yourself and for your children , your husband , your family , in terms of your disease ? P : No , they just come and go real ( low quivery voice ) fast . ( nervous giggle ) D : They do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discuss anything with me . How my life is . D : I wonder . You know you have a very serious issue to deal with in your own life . I 've been impressed that often-times , just as you were talking about the chart , sometimes it 's more difficult for us to deal with our feelings if we do n't know what it is we 're dealing with . In other words , it 's like in the dark , if you do n't know what 's in the dark then you may be very scared of it . If you know what 's out there in the dark , then you can do something about dealing with it . P : Yes . An Interview with a Dying Mother 93 D : And I wonder about your husband and your children . I understand you have three children ? P : My husband and I are separated . D : You 're separated ? I see . So he 's not involved in your life now at all ? P : No . He comes to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have one child by my second husband , and he comes to see the baby on weekends . D : And who are the children living with ? P : My brother 's taking care of my kids . He 's 34 , he used to teach , and he had a lot of psychology ? child psychology . He 's real good with the kids . D : So he 's helping take care of your kids while you 're sick now . Does he know about your illness and what is wrong with your heart ? P : ( nervous cough ) I think so . D : You have n't talked with him about it ? P : No ( nervous laugh ) He is n't a very talkative person . D : Who is it that you talk with ? P : I do n't talk to anybody . D : Do n't talk to anybody ? P : No , ( pause 15 seconds ) not at all about my problems ( pause 10 seconds ) . D : Yet you are able to sustain some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very depressed or very discouraged ! P : I think you just do what you have to do , that 's all . ( nervous laugh ) There is n't anything else I can do ! ( clears throat , pause 15 seconds ) D : With this courage , then , you do what you have to do , which is a pretty good day-by-day way of tackling things . Now , have you talked with your brother about the management of your children , or plans to take care of them while you 're so sick like this ? P : I do n't have to talk to him , I just watch him . He 's good with them , and they like him a lot . He 's great with them . ( pause 10 seconds ) D : One of the things about serious illness is the need for appropriate plans , with your family , with your kids . With a serious illness like this , you were sort of half kidding , and I assume maybe half serious , in saying , " gee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might possibly drop dead " ? you might have a sudden heart attack . So , how will your kids be taken care of ? P : I do n't know , I just figure that God will take care of them , that 's all I can think . That 's the only thing I can believe , anything else would frighten me . D : Would frighten you ? P : Well , would n't it frighten you ? ( pause ? ah ) Well , sure it would . D : I 'm not sure what you 're frightened of , that 's why I 'm not responding . P : ( clears throat ) Well , ( clears throat , pause 15 seconds ) I ca n't worry about what will happen to the kids , you know . If I can take care of them , I 'll take care of them ; if I ca n't , I just can't. ( coughs several times , clears throat ) D : Do you want a drink of water ? P : O.K. ( 40-second pause ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and handle a lot of this by yourself , ( pause 10 seconds ) someways courageous ! What about your brother and your parents , what is their willingness to support or share with you the situation , you 're in today ? 94 Introduction P : I do n't know . D : Have they tried to talk with you at all ? P : ( pause ) No . Just take the kids a lot . D : They do ! P : Yep . ( pause 10 seconds ) D : But they never openly share with you , talk openly with you about your illness ? Do you think it would be helpful to them if they could talk openly with you ? P : I do n't know . D : Do they live around here ? P : Yes . D : And they know that you 're sick ? P : Yes . D : You know sometimes we play the game of " you know that I know that we both know but we ca n't let each other know " ? you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( pause 15 seconds ) D : So I would imagine they might have a lot of questions about your illness ! How serious it is and what 's going to be the outcome . Have they talked with any of your doctors about it ? P : A couple of times . D : What 's their understanding of your sickness ? P : I do n't know . ( clears throat ) They seem annoyed . D : Really ! P : Yeah . D : Well , what happened ? P : Well , they have to take the kids a lot cause I ca n't take care of them . And , it just seems like you know , well , not that they do n't want to be bothered , cause they always , you know , are good with the kids , and come to see them a lot and everything , but they 've had to be bothered more than they used to , and ah , I do n't think they like it . D : Do they say so ? P @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just seems to me , I do n't know , maybe I 'm being a bother , maybe they do n't feel that way at all . I ca n't really say , you 'll have to ask them . D : That raises a possibility ! I wonder how you feel about it . Sometimes when people have a serious illness like you have , we find it useful to get the family together , the brothers , the sisters , mom , dad . Sit down and talk together as a family about how we can handle things together , how we can be honest and open with each other , and how we can agree together to do the things that need to be done . How do you think they 'd respond to something like that ? P : I do n't know . D : Do you think it might be helpful to them ? P : Helpful to them ? I doubt it . D : How about to you ? P : ( pause 10 seconds ) I doubt it . ( pause 10 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm not saying that should be done , but just a possibility for you to think about these things . An Interview with a Dying Mother 95 P : ( clears throat ) D : The doctors apparently talked with-your relatives , but you do n't quite know what they 've told them , and you have n't talked with them all that much yet ? P : No . D : Any questions you 'd like to have answered ? That we could have your doctors tell you about your disease ? P : Oh ! I do n't know , I guess so when it comes right down to it . D : What sort of things are the big hanging questions ? P : Whether or not I 'm going to live , and if I am for how long , and if I 'm going to die , how long do I have to live . D : I do n't know the answer to those questions myself . I do know that you have this cancer of your heart and I do know from my reading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Like you said half-joking , sometimes it does cause sudden death . You may have a heart attack suddenly , but we ca n't predict that . I 'm no heart specialist ? human heart , but not the anatomical heart . These heart tumors grow at different rates , so it 's difficult to predict exactly how long a person may live until they die . ( pause ) But the issue is not whether a person dies or not , since we all die at some point or other in life . But the question is what we have to deal with , human heart speaking , while we look forward to the possibility of our own death ? what are the emotional human heart problems we 've got to deal with ourselves ? P : ( pause 25 seconds , clears throat ) I do n't understand what you mean . D : I 'll try to explain ? you were asking , when do I die and how long before I die ? I do n't know those answers specifically . But there are other things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How do we deal with our kids , our family , how do we deal with our own feelings about being sick , about having this serious disease ? We 've got these sorts of things to deal with , our own feelings , our feelings about the people we love , people we have some responsibility for , our kids . P : Yeah . D : How we can deal with these things . How we can be of help . We ca n't change the disease . I ca n't really help that . P : No. ( pause 10 seconds ) I feel pretty secure that my brother has my kids , I think , cause he 's good with them . ( clears throat ) I was frantic once because my mother could n't keep them , but then he showed up on the scene and I guess that 's why I feel confident that he 's got them and will stay with them if something does happen to me , if I die . And I , I , feel relieved and I feel confident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , and they just love him . D : Has he made that commitment to you that he will take care of the kids if you die ? P : Just , he has n't actually said that he would , but he 's been there , he 's been there . He was gone in the daytime for awhile , but , ah , he 's coming every night , he 's keeping watch , cause he knew I was sick . D : Yes ! And he knew that this was a fatal disease that you have ? P : A-huh . D : Does he know that you have the cancer ? P : ( clears throat ) I think so . D : You think so ? You 're just not quite sure ? 96 Introduction P : ( pause ) Well , he knows as well as anybody knows , as well as I know . D : Yeah ? P : That 's what they tell me . D : Do you find that doctors find it hard to talk about fatal diseases and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we can deal with it ? P : Doctors do n't talk much about anything . ( giggle ) They make their own language . D : Yeah . P : They just come in and they start talking about stitches and your injuries , and all this business of well , I do n't know what they 're talking about . They do n't say much to you , you know , just what you need in the line of medicine , how you feel and check your pulse and everything . D : The reason I bring this up is because we doctors are just beginning to learn to deal with our own feelings about dying and death . Doctors have had as much trouble in dealing with our personal feelings and reactions to it as anybody else ; and doctors have a great deal of difficulty in talking with patients who are dying , unless patients happen to be very old people , who are sort of wearing out at the end of the line . With young people that are dying , I think we often have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or frank . It is almost as though we were afraid to talk about it , for fear that something bad is going to happen if we talk about it . P : Well , ah , I know I would feel that way if I had to tell someone about death . D : Uh-huh . P : They 're just human beings , you know . D : Yeah . P : They are n't superpeople , or anything , so it either frightens them or it does n't , I guess . D : Have you felt frightened about your own dying at all ? P : Yeah ? have you ? D : Sure . P : Do you feel frightened about your dying ? D : Yes . P : O.K. then , you know . ( giggle ) D : Yes . P : ( giggles again ) Then you do n't have to ask me. ( nervous laugh , clears throat ) D : I guess what I was asking was really not how does it feel , because I know that you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now ? Is it tolerable not to know just where you are going ? P : Just , I do n't want to be alone , that 's all , and do what I have to do . D : In other words , you were more frightened about the idea of dying a while back than you are now ? P : Yeah . D : Any other feelings that are bothersome now , besides the frightening feelings ? P : No , when you 've been as sick as I 've been and for as long as I 've been , you just have to , to accept it , because there is a very strong possibility . D : Yeah . That 's right ! But you 've made some adjustments to the illness , in An Interview with a Dying Mother 97 the sense that when you were first frightened you learned to deal with that and accept that frightened feeling , am I right in that ? ( pause ) Or is it still bothering you ? P : It does n't bother me now . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used to being sick and not being able to care for yourself and the kids the way you used to . And you have made some plans about the care of your children and yourbrother 's going to take care of them . P : I feel he 's helped . D : And these other things that need to be planned out or taken care of while you 're still sick , before you have to face really getting very sick and dying ? P : ( pause 10 seconds ) D : Do you think they are pretty well handled ? P : ( pause 15 seconds ) D : So you 're going to live it day-by-day ? P : Yeah . D : Well , that 's a pretty healthy way of doing things . P : ( nervous giggle ) Yeah , that 's the way I 've always done it ( clears throat ) just what I 've had to do . D : The reason I mention this is that the nurses and other personnel at the hospital have been very on edge . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say " How are you feeling today " , or say " Do you know that Mrs. so-and-so has a bad heart disease that is ultimately going to be fatal ? " Then we start building up half-truths , where everybody gets on edge and tense instead of being able to be straightforward , honest , and respect each other . P : They 've all been great . D : They 're been very concerned about you . P : Well , I certainly have been getting a lot of attention to me , today anyway . ( light laugh ) D : Yeah . You get to be superstar today ! P : Yeah . ( laughs ) They told me a long time ago that I would obtain star billing from my illness , and it looks like I have . ( both laugh ) D : Well , if not a huge star billing , at least a small one . P : ( laughs ) A gold one . ( laughs ) D : Well , we 've been talking today about the whole process of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for it . But perhaps you have some questions you 'd like to ask about things we have n't talked about . P : No. ( pause 10 seconds ) I ca n't think of anything . D : I very much appreciate your talking with us today . Your openness , honesty , frankness , and willingness is a real help to us . The patient died suddenly the next morning . COMMENT Several major issues , common to many dying persons , are raised and illustrated in this interview I offer my comments and interpretations , while inviting readers to reflect on their own possible interpretations . 98 Introduction The Function of Denial At the beginning , the patient alleges that she knows little if anything about her illness and her prognosis . As our discussion continues , it becomes obvious that she has much greater awareness of her condition than she intimates . Why is this ? One reason might be the social constraints on conversation . This is the familiar theme of " closed awareness . " All parties possess personal awareness of what is going on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For example , the patient refers to peeking at her chart , looking up her disease in the dictionary , and never obtaining any information from the doctors on their daily rounds . Thus , the subtle message may be that one is not supposed to discuss dying and death , even if you know about it . There seem to be elements of social constraint encouraging denial here . A second reason , however , may lie with the patient herself . As she gradually talks more openly about her dying and death , she does not pursue her thoughts and feelings even after acknowledging and accepting them . Rather , after each bit of open acknowledgement she pauses , coughs , and withdraws back into her immediate self . To describe the process in a metaphor : We openly write her feelings and thoughts in the moist sand , which are then washed away in the next wave of denial . We write again in the sand , and it is washed away again by the recurrent wave of denial . But should she somehow be forced into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I certainly nudged and pushed along toward an open discussion . But then I moved back from a demand for open discussion ? and supported her use of denial . What is to be gained from pushing and demanding some explicit open stance ? I suggest that the need in this case was the doctor 's need ( my own need ) to have the patient discuss issues in the same way that I wanted to discuss them ; not her need . It is not her lack of awareness that is the major denial mechanism here . She is aware . She just wants to maintain herself without having to face that painful awareness all the time : " When you 've been as sick as long as I 've been , you just have to accept it . " So she closes over , she suppresses , she denies . And it helps her to manage her daily hour-by-hour existence . Do we want to deny her the freedom and modest tranquility of her style of coping , by demanding that she continually endure the pain of her conscious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us look at ourselves in our daily life with such ruthless honesty . In this An Interview with a Dying Mother 99 rase , as perhaps throughout life , mechanisms of denial are useful and necessary . The extent of this patient 's use of denial was remarkable . In fact , her brother had formally adopted her children . In fact , her brother and parents had a precise knowledge of her diagnosis and prognosis . In fact , her personal physician had discussed her medical condition in exact LIctail with her . In fact , her relatives had been visiting regularly with her . /n fact , she talked often and closely with many of the nursing staff . This posthoc data indicates a substantial degree of denial of the major interest , involvement , and concern on the part of others . However , I do not consider this degree of denial necessarily dysfunctional nor pathological . Rather , it enabled her to maintain some degree of emotional composure . she set the level of awareness . I think that the interview demonstrates her need to maintain a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And she can then continue to function so long as she can maintain denial along several fronts . To summarize : I could push this young mother to discuss her thoughts ; wd feelings about dying and death . I could engage her conscious awareness . I would momentarily broach her defenses of denial . However , she indicated that she needed those denial mechanisms . I would be inappropriate , inhumane , and irrelevant to suggest that she not use her denial mechanisms to maintain herself . Hie Function of Withdrawal Throughout the interview , the doctor ( myself ) continually came back to the patient 's relationships with her family , and more specifically her children . In retrospect , my focus was out of place . I was influenced in my own thinking at that time about anticipatory grief and the problems of maintenance of relationships during the dying period . My concern was ; appropriate , but out of phase . Much earlier in her dying trajectory , this young mother no doubt was concerned about her children and family . But she is too sick now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ability to cathect others . She is withdrawing into herself . She can barely sustain herself . She has little available resource inside herself to invest in others . Lime and again I tried to elicit her involvement with others . She appropriately resisted me : " I ca n't worry about what will happen to the kids , %ou know , if I ca n't take care of them . " She is sicker than I realize . She is approaching death more quickly than I sense . I try to pull her into reality ; while she is withdrawing from reality . I did not support her withdrawal , which was the only way she could now maintain herself . 100 Introduction The Function of Faith and Hope This young mother says that her faith and hope sustain her . Does that mean she realistically believes she will be cured ? I think not . She believes that her children will be taken care of . She believes that her doctors and nurses will give her the best possible care . She believes that it would be good to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dies . Her faith and hope are not in the fantasy that things will change , but rather her assurance that her life is acceptable and her situation is tolerable as she is . She believes that it is all right to live just one day at a time . In my opinion , her faith and hope is that she is all right , she is affirming her sense of being at peace with herself . Major Fears It may well be that different issues provoke fear at different phases throughout the trajectory of dying . Some items suggest this in the interview . Apparently , the fear of death did present itself early in the patient 's illness . But she no longer is afraid of death . In fact , she is more comfortable than I. She challenges me when I inquire as to the fear of death . She knows ? do n't I know ? Of course I do . But she is less afraid of death now than I am . Early in her illness she feared for her children . But now she has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She need no longer fear for the welfare or her relationship with them . The fear of being a bother , a nuisance , and an imposition crops up in relation to her family . Apparently , she feared the possible anger of her family . But that has been resolved . The fear of being alone , however , still remains . When I asked if it was tolerable to not know exactly what was going to happen , she responds : " Just ? I do n't want to be alone . " Finally , she repeatedly expresses her need to be able to manage ? to cope , to deal with her own day-to-day existence . At the end of the interview we briefly kid about rewards for performance ? star billing ? or just the child 's stickum star . She expresses what she needs : " A gold one . " She , in my opinion , wants recognition and affirmation that she is doing a good job of doing what she can do . Recognition that she is a person doing the best she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she remains a person of integrity in her dying . An Interview with a Dying Mother 101 CONCLUSIONS The lessons I have learned from this one patient include the following : First , that despite my years of talking with dying persons , my own anxieties about death and dying still remain close and undeniably real in my own sense of existence , ready to be stirred in every personal encounter , for this dying woman challenges my own denial of mortality . Two , that awareness may be confused with denial . I believe that this young mother demonstrated how a person can have awareness and still appropriately use denial mechanisms . I conclude that denial mechanisms are important and useful . Three , I learned that withdrawal rather than engagement becomes more important as one approaches death . Four , I observed that different fears and anxieties emerge at different phases of the dying process . In this case , I was out of phase with the patient , and failed to address fears of the present in the best way possible , because I was intent on fears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I learned that a person needs affirmation of who they are . The dying person can cope with death but not loss of the sense of self-integrity . EARLY CHILDHOOD The first two chapters , by Carlin and by Wood , present the problem of dying in the young infant stage of life . The focus is on the family of the infant . Notice the feelings of guilt , disappointment , anger , and frustration that the parents express . In both chapters similar feelings are strongly expressed by the professional staff . In this social system there is a shared belief that the death of an infant is a tragedy . What is the meaning of bringing a malformed child into the world who will never attain normal adulthood ? The struggle to make sense of this event appears to be a central issue . Ambivalence toward the infant is obvious : Shall we let the child die , or shall we struggle to keep it alive against insurmountable odds ? Both authors suggest that the staff must resolve their own ambivalence and sense of helplessness before they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Seligman on the burned child gives an accurate picture of the primitive coping mechanisms used by the very sick child : hallucinations , delusions , manifest phantasies , and various obvious distortions of reality . These are not psychotic children but rather very sick youngsters experiencing severe stress . Thus , they rapidly fluctuate in using the primitive coping mechanisms available to the young child . Seligman illustrates the devastating emotional impact on staff and on families when the dying trajectory takes an unanticipated shift . The interaction between child , family , and staff is clearly demonstrated here . The chapter by Towne and Wold is a contrast , with its focus on the home and family life of a chronic dying trajectory . Here they highlight the impact of dying upon the other children of the family as well as on 103 104 Early Childhood the parents . They stress the importance of clear and accurate communication of information . They note how vulnerable the family members are to unexplored phantasies , hopes , fears , and expectations . They rightly point out that the care of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Life of the Malformed Child Jean E. Carlin Unlike other chapters , which deal with conditions leading to the death of a previously normal and healthy person , this chapter deals with the dying of children , most of whom have never been normal and healthy . Many of the problems of developmental anomalies have their origins before birth and can be recognized at birth ; others became apparent shortly after bith . Thus , the primary concern will be with the unique problems faced by parents and medical personnel dealing with developmental anomalies severe enough to lead to a probable termination of life in days or months or a few years . These abnormalities are the results of genetic abnormalities ; prenatal infections of the developing fetus ; damage to the developing fetus as a result of toxins and drugs ; damage to the developing fetus from oxygen deprivation ; or interference with normal development from as yet unknown causes . Although the etiologies ( causes ) are diverse , the abnormal children present many similarities with which parents and medical personnel must cope . Of primary importance is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after many months of pregnancy . Parents of normal babies are often seriously disappointed if their new baby is not the sex for which they had hoped . How much more profound is their disappointment when the baby is not " normal " as they had expected ? No one can really know , unless he or she has experienced this overwhelming shock and disappointment . Much has been written on this ( Gardner 1968 ; Menolascino 1968 ; Solnit , Stark 1961 ) . But , little has been written about how these parents and the medical personnel cope with watching 105 106 Early Childhood these abnormal babies live and slowly die . Also , many parents cease to have contact with these dying children , and so the medical personnel are surrogate parents . Observations of new personnel , medical students , and resident physicians unaccustomed to facing the malformed and malfunctioning child give some clues as to how they come to terms with these realities . Parents go through similar sequences if they remain in contact with their children ; but some parents and some employees flee the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frequently used method of coping , but since escape-avoidance tells little about the acceptance and integration necessary actually to care for these infants and children until their death , the option of massive and total denial will not he discussed here . STAGES OF ' ADAPTATION I have observed new staff unaccustomed to developmental anomalies progress through various stages in their adjustment . As in early childhood development , one may remain fixated at an earlier level , so , too , personnel may remain fixated at any of the following levels , thus hampering their effectiveness : Stage 1 ? Most medical students and uninitiated resident physicians do not want to see nor hear about people with severe physical and mental developmental problems . They seek ways to avoid knowing , trying not to come to hospitals or wards with this kind of patient , or by being late or ill . It is as if " out of sight is out of mind " will solve the problems ? or denial and escape-avoidance . Stage 2 ? When they do come and see , the next stage is one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what , onto the hospital or ward caring for these patients , onto the doctors and nurses working with these patients , and onto the person or persons whom they perceive as responsible for sending them to work and learn in such a terrible place . Stage 3 ? They enter a period of depression often clinically apparent and even picked up on psychological tests . Sometimes the depression immobilizes the doctor or medical student for a time to the point of being unable to get from his or her office onto the wards and he or she may even develop symptoms of physical illnesses allowing him or her to say home " sick . " During this stage of depression , the whole problem of the meaning and purpose of life ? everyone 's life , the abnormal patient , other patients , one 's family , and even one 's own life ? comes into focus and re-evaluation . The question of the ultimate meaning of life , which had been wrestled with in adolescence and thought to be well solved and The Life of the Malformed Child 107 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reevaluation . If these maldeveloped patients are alive , why are they alive ? And why am I alive ? And what is life ? and death ? And if these anomalies exist , they could happen to my children ! These kinds of existential meaning problems are what immobilize one 's energy during this , stage of depression . Stage 4 ? This stage is again one of directed anger ? but now anger directed at God or the Powers That Be , or at society for allowing such anomalies to occur and live . The problem of how can a God permit innocent babies ( and families ) to suffer so much haunts those who believe in God . Others become angry with a society the " allows " these children to live . And suddenly the unacceptable thought ? they would be better off dead ! ? occurs to otherwise kind medical personnel , who are trained and committed to respecting and preserving life . This is often a frightening and unacceptable thought . Immobilization may occur because of ambivalence , that is , the strong desire to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ training and commitment to saving life ? all life . Anger is intensified by the ambivalence as a result of being forced to make such a choice , and one experiences a strong need for someone else to make that choice instead ( a desire to be dependent ) . Stage 5 ? A period of resignation and helplessness , which could be stated : These patients are people who are alive and are going to live for a time , but there are too many with too many needs ; there is nothing I can do ! This feels more comfortable than the preceding stages , but it also may immobilize for a time . Stage 6 ? this stage is one of acceptance and involvement , which might be stated : All right , I ca n't prevent these problems yet and I ca n't cure them now and I ca n't help all of the people , but I can begin with a few patients and a few problems and see what I can learn and teach and accomplish . This stage is the beginning of the end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at hand is scaled down to bite-sized pieces and begun . In much the same way , parents who remain involved with their retarded and/or handicapped children proceed through stages complicated by guilt and fears and misunderstandings , in addition to the above six stages . CASE ILLUSTRATIONS Conversations with ward personnel , medical students , resident physicians , staff doctors , and families of patients , all of whom are somewhere along the way proceeding through or beyond these six stages , have been 108 Early Childhood valuable to observe . One psychiatric technician , a middle-aged woman , said " I never had any children and I have much love to give to babies , and these babies need much love . When I look at them I think it would be better if they would die because I know what is ahead for them if they live with their problems . But I learn to know each one as an individual and love him or her . And yet , when they die , I am glad . " When asked if that did n't create a conflict @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would die ? she answered , " Oh , no . I take good care of each one , and when God is ready He takes each child , and I did n't cause the child to die ? we always try to keep it alive , but sometimes it is out of our hands . " An educated and sophisticated father of a profoundly retarded malformed child said , " I hope she will die soon . I want to know she is being well cared for , but I hope she will die . " He claimed to be an atheist . He engaged in much discussion in his attempt to find meaning for this , his third child with the same defects . Finally , he began to ask if the hospital " experimented " on these babies . He clarified that he did not mean anything harmful to them , but rather if we attempted to learn anything from them that might eventually be of use to others . I assured him that we do study many things about our patients in an attempt to understand normal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been interfered with at various stages , when enzymes are missing , or when unusual gene combinations occur . He then smiled , seemed relieved , and said , " You mean , like the sacrificial lamb ? my baby 's life and death might help someone else someday ! " He had found a meaning to his existential problem . One physician wrote the initial evaluation of a baby with multiple congenital anomalies , who was transferred from another hospital for care . The initial statement regarding the general appearance of the patient read , " Cute chubby little chappie , who looks perfectly normal with his clothes on . " And , thus , the physician attempted to deny reality by focusing on what looked normal . This is a common phenomenon . One nurse , in discussing a baby with multiple facial and central nervous system anomalies , kept commenting on what a beautifully formed body the infant had . She had learned to attend to the few signs of normalcy to help her to keep her perspective . One psychiatric resident insisted that he could not work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very verbal , and hence he has " nothing in common " with his retarded patient . After two months of almost daily contact between the patient and the resident The Life of the Malformed Child 109 doctor , both had changed . The resident doctor decided that the patient was n't retarded ! Because the two of them had related well and enjoyed each other , they were genuinely sad on parting . Since the doctor had not become less bright , he had to perceive that the patient was really bright to be of interest to him ! The patient himself perceived that he could have friends who were not other patients , and he requested discharge to a foster home ( after 13 years in the hospital for the retarded ) . The psychiatric resident was able to become involved with the patient 's problems and only persisted in a verbal denial of his own uselessness in working with the retarded . CONCLUSIONS The multihandicapped infant or child with developmental anomalies , who is at or near death at all times , presents a very real threat to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all who encounter him or her . Parents and medical personnel alike are forced into frequent re-evaluations of their beliefs and values and actions . It is painful and exhausting , for with each child 's death , the personnel , parents , and family die a little . But , it can be challenging and rewarding . Some babies ? few , but each one important ? make it past the time of imminent death . An occasional comatose child awakens or a cardiac problem can be corrected . Then the child can start from there to proceed through the stages of development to the limit of his or her physical and mental potential . Others die , and their suffering has ended . And others linger on between life and death . Every tiny sign of development is noted and encouraged , and every new medical discovery is greeted with guarded optimism that some day prevention and cures might be reality . But in the meantime , what is one tiny step for mankind may be a giant step for a tiny needy patient . It seems essential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stages first before they can get on with the business at hand . Second , staff and families must be able to identify and appreciate those positive and normal aspects of appearance , personality , and behavior that are part of the child . Third , staff and families must be able to set short-term immediate goals that can be achieved and produce some short-term rewards . Fourth , staff and families must attain some resolution of the existential issues of ultimate meaning for their own existence and the meaning of the existence of the retarded and handicapped child ? even though the life of that child may be short and unpredictable . 110 Early Childhood Once a sense of meaning has been established , even though at times that sense may be shaken , the life and death of the child with developmental anomalies become similar to the life and death of any other person . Meningomyelocele Infants Paul E. Wood The birth , life , and death of a deformed child in a family is always painful and traumatic , and such a child presents a complex emotional , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not those of simple death , grief , and mourning , but they are the problems of how family , friends , and professional staff adapt and cope with the labyrinthine complexities of an oftentimes life-threatening , multifaceted , deforming handicap . In the deformity of meningomyelocele , the meninges ( membranes that envelop the brain and spinal cord ) and the spinal cord nerves protrude through a defect in the spine , resulting in hydrocephalus , loss of bladder and sphincter control , and varying degrees of decreased motor activity and sensation of the lower extremities . Secondary complications often include infections of the blood and/or meninges , blocked ventriculoatrial ( involving the heart ) shunts , eye muscle imbalance , urinary tract infections , deformities and fractures of the lower extremities , trophic ulcers , and obesity . In addition , mental retardation may also occur . The reported incidence of death in the first five years of life in these children ranges from 80 to 90 percent if untreated , down to approximately 20 percent with comprehensive medical and surgical treatment . The majority of deaths occur in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the neonatal period before the infant goes home or after repeated lengthy and costly hospitalizations . The impact of the deformed child on the family begins at birth when the mother senses the anxiety and concern of the doctors and nurses in the delivery room . The newborn often will be whisked away to an isolation 111 112 Early Childhood room , frequently without the mother ever seeing him or her . Later , after she asks many attendants , nurses , and doctors , someone will begin to explain honestly how her baby is different . Her shock , grief , confusion , and physical exhaustion will make it difficult for her to comprehend all that is said , but she will know that she has given birth to a deformed child . This fact will weigh heavily on her as she attempts to deal with her feelings of guilt and responsibility , which are mixed with confusion and a sense of personal inadequacy . No amount of professional reassurance or medical knowledge will assuage the guilt she feels . As one mother put it , " That baby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 's my fault . " Another examined her period of gestation looking for clues as to what she had done wrong that caused her baby to be deformed . Many others view the deformed child as God 's way of punishing them for sins they have committed . In the midst of all this emotional turmoil , parents are confronted with the need for a decision regarding surgery on their newborn . Most commonly , physicians will advise in favor of surgery ( especially in teaching hospitals ) , and the majority of parents will consent , feeling the doctor knows best and that the decision is really a medical one . This way , essentially allowing the physician to make the decision , reduces further guilt and responsibility of the parents , at the same time giving them a feeling that they are doing everything they can for the child . Unfortunately , most parents are so confused and ambivalent at this time that they do not adequately deal with whether or not they really want to do everything possible to save their deformed child . The parents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child are frequently of a higher socieconomic status . They may have experienced an earlier deformed child and wish not to repeat the process . In one dramatic example , a young middle class woman became pregnant out of wedlock and attempted to abort herself with an overdose of medication . She gave birth to an infant with meningomyelocele and has since devoted her entire life to the treatment and rehabilitation of her child . She shuns any adult social contacts for herself unless they are related to the treatment of her child , and in essence she has sacrificed her own life out of guilt over her deformed child . This kind of behavior does not become problematic until the child attempts to separate from the overprotecting mother , and then they both encounter serious problems . In three other similar cases , two became juvenile delinquents in adolescence and one developed psychosomatic symptoms , which forced him to stay at home with his mother . Another example of " save the baby at all costs " behavior was a Meningomyelocele Infants 113 grandmother and grandfather who adopted their daughter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lifestyle to accommodate the child . The grandmother gave up a very good job , the family moved to the inner city to be near the hospital , and the 24-hour care of the child became their reason for living . They denied many of the child 's limitations and would concentrate exclusively on her achievements . They isolated themselves from their old friends , and their only social contacts became parents of deformed children . In our group therapy , it became clear that both of these people felt very guilty about the way their own three children had turned out . Their daughter ran away at age 17 , became pregnant , and was not sure who was the father of her child . Of their two sons , one had been shot to death in a drug raid and the other was in federal prison for murder . It is little wonder that they wished to devote themselves to exclusively to their daughter 's grossly deformed baby in an effort to absolve themselves of some of their guilt feelings . Less dramatic are the families who appear to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lower class minority families , who have known of deformity in their local community and who may , indeed , have had a sibling or relative with the deformity . They tend to appear very accepting , yet there are many evidences of denial in their behavior . They often isolate themselves and avoid talking about or revealing that their baby is deformed . An interesting example of this is the way these mothers wrap the head of their hydrocephalic baby so that only the face shows , thus concealing any evidence of deformity . In addition , they are excessively overprotective and frequently allow little or no self-sufficiency or independence in the child . They also tend to overfeed the deformed child in an attempt to make him or her look fat and healthy . Behaviors such as temper tantrums , demanding one 's own way , and retention of infantile habits are viewed as cute and appropriate , and therefore , do not require any intervention or confrontation from the parents . These parents tend to view their deformed children as incapable of any kind of normal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not allow them the opportunities for growth experiences that other children receive . This becomes a problem as the child reaches school age and the parental views of the child 's incapability conflict with the views of his or her doctors and school officials . A good example of this type of behavior is a 30-year-old MexicanAmerican mother of five , whose husband had told her not to have any more babies after the third . Her sixth infant was born with a midthoracolumbar ( chest and abdominal regions ) meningomyelocele with 114 Early Childhood hydrocephalus , incontinence , and no motor ability in the lower extremities . Her guilt over having a deformed child was expressed in thoughts when she repeatedly stated that it never would have happened if she had just done what her husband had told her . Her behavior toward the deformed child was remarkable in her overprotectiveness and isolation of herself and her infant . She grossly overfed the baby so that at 14 months the child weighed 45 pounds and could do nothing but remain in the position in which she was placed . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the family 's attention , demanding and receiving anything she wanted . At age six she was still taking all her milk from a bottle , sleeping in her parent 's bed , and refusing to go to school . When the school officials demanded that the child attend school , the mother came to our group for help . She quickly perceived how she was allowing her daughter to manipulate and control her , but it was with great reluctance that she was able to take a firm parenting stand and demand that the child go to school . Interestingly , after a few months in school , the child gave up many of her infantile ways and behaved quite appropriately . Her mother became depressed over the loss of her baby , and again the group helped her to understand and be a part of the growth and progress that the child was making . On the other end of the spectrum is a middle-aged mother of three , who gave birth to a meningomyelocele baby and refused to acknowledge the infant 's existence after one look at his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet born and denied that the deformed infant was hers . She refused to consent to any treatment for the infant , and he died shortly thereafter . In this example , the husband was interviewed and was in agreement with his wife 's position . He stated that if the baby upset his normally easygoing wife to that extent , then he felt that what she was doing was best for herself and her family , and he supported her . In another somewhat similar case , an upper-middle class mother of a normal two-year-old gave birth to a badly deformed infant and stated that she wanted nothing to do with the infant , that it would seriously intrude into her life , and she would not accept it . After this woman left the hospital , the baby was treated and some minor improvements in his condition were made . His mother later visited him at the urgings of her own mother and broke down in tears when her baby made eye contact with her . She then visited regularly and became involved with her child . However , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman maintained her original feelings and asked for placement of her child , with a fund to be established to pay for his care so that she would not need to know whether he was alive or dead . Meningomyelocele Infants 115 The problem of ultimate death for the families of deformed children is a continuation of their problems in life . For many families , death comes as a relief from the painful , trying , daily existence they have suffered . For others , who have invested so deeply in the child , death is felt as a great loss and is mourned and grieved extensively . For still others , whose personal guilt over the deformed child is so great , the death only corn-pounds the guilt , and these people frequently try to make up to their lost child , in death , what they feel they did not do in life . There is no set pattern of behavior exhibited when a deformed child dies , but the follow ing case examples will serve to illustrate some typical reactions . CASE STUDIES CASE 1 . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meningomyelocele infant as her first child . Her husband left her when she refused to give up the child for placement . The child had repeated shunt infections , brain abscesses , pulmonary and urinary tract infections , and his mother stayed by his side all the time making plans to take him to the best specialists in the world . When she was told that he had a very poor prognosis with his final infection , she renewed her intensive involvement with him , spending long hours at his bedside caring for him . However , as the weeks drew on and he changed little , she decreased her visits and became less and less involved with him . At that time his condition worsened , he weakened and died . His mother accepted his death as best for both of them and resumed her professional life . It appears that her tapering off of contacts with her son demonstrated a reality-based recognition of his true status , and this helped her to deal with his death . CASE 2 . A multiple deformed meningomyelocele baby was born to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the many deformities , he had to be hospitalized many times in the first year of his life , and he finally died at age 14 months . His family was deeply grieved at his loss because they had tried very hard to accept him and love him , and to overcome their own guilt over conceiving him . In spite of genetic counseling , this woman became pregnant again soon after the death of her son and later gave birth to an even more deformed baby . She originally tried to deny the baby and did not visit him in the hospital , but as his condition became critical , and she was notified , she visited regularly taking pictures and involving herself with her infant . He lived only six weeks , and the family appeared relieved at his death . This family did not give up , however , in their desire to have a child . They further underwent 116 Early Childhood genetic counseling , established a major contributing factor in the husband 's heredity , and sought artificial insemination , which proved successful and gave them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a happy ending , however , as demonstrated in the following two examples . CASE 3 . An 18-year-old girl gave birth to a meningomyelocele baby with many deformities and a very poor prognosis . She demanded that every attempt be made to save her baby , claiming that it was the only thing that could hold her and her boyfriend together . After she left the hospital , she visited the baby once and was not able to be reached at the time of the baby 's death . It appears that she had very little investment in her baby because most of her energy was tied up in trying to meet her own infantile needs . CASE 4 . In another tragic case , a woman gave birth to her fourth child , a badly deformed meningomyelocele baby . Her husband rejected the baby as not being his and refused to live in the same house with the baby . When she brought the baby home , her husband fled , taking the three other children and leaving her with nothing . She tried desperately to love and accept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her husband and three children made it very difficult and she began neglecting the infant . The baby died a few weeks later , and this guilt-ridden distraught woman borrowed a large sum of money for an elaborate funeral for her dead baby in an apparent attempt to relieve her guilt . The families of deformed children are not the only persons who become deeply involved . Hospital staffs , because of their multiple and often lengthy , intensive contacts , also face many problems in dealing with their feelings and behaviors related to deformed , dying children . No one can remain neutral and objective dealing with these children . Because the doctors , nurses , social workers , and attendants are all very human , their responses tend to be individualized and personal . They do , however , tend to fall into two major groups , which are the " every life must be saved at all costs group " and the " some babies are better off dead group . " A few examples will help to clarify these feelings and behaviors . A nursing student became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who was hospitalized for a shunt revision . In her vigorous efforts to help , she regularly propped him up in an infant seat , which , unknown to her , applied pressure to his back which led the meningomyelocele to breakdown , infection , and eventual death . She was very upset when she discovered that she had contributed to his death because she had such a strong conviction that she could really help him , although others had given up . Meningomyelocele Infants 117 A similar feeling was expressed by a junior resident during his stay on the ward . He expressed the view that to him death meant a medical or surgical failure , and since he viewed himself as a very fine physician and surgeon , he expected no deaths on his service . He ran into major conflict with the head nurse , a very compassionate and sensitive person who viewed death as a legitimate function of life . When a new multiple deformed infant was admitted to the service , the resident and nurse talked to the parents , who asked that no heroic measures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them that he was the doctor in charge and would make those decisions . The infant was then placed on electronic monitoring of his vital functions with instructions to the nursing staff to notify the resident at the first sign of any abnormality . The infant underwent numerous medical and surgical procedures and treatments , and finally died three weeks later when the resident was out of town . The nursing staff and parents were relieved at the infant 's death , but the resident maintained that he could have saved the life if he had been there . What he did not know was that the child had stopped eating nearly two weeks before and the nurses were not force feeding him or reporting his poor intake . A very different view was held by the thoughtful , humble woman resident who succeeded the above resident on the ward . She did an extensive work-up on each new child and then held an in-depth interview with the parents to try to determine their honest feelings about their deformed child . She always accepted their decision to allow their child to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confusing she held further conferences to clarify their feelings . This physician was loved and respected by the parents , the patients , the staff , and the other residents . The determination to turn off a respirator or not to perform heroic measures when a child dies in a hospital is always difficult , but when it is made in concert with the parents and physician it appears to be more acceptable . A technique that has been extremely helpful and successful in dealing with the families and involved staff is regular group meetings . It is always impressive to see the interactions between families , and it is eye opening and sensitizing to the staff . The most popular themes of the groups are the successes and achievements the children have made . They share ideas and information , which is helpful to all , and frequently bring up problems and concerns , which the group handles . The issues of overprotection , isolation , sibling rivalry , discipline , marital stress , and guilt are also common concerns . The issue of death is usually avoided in favor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life . When a death occurs , the group supports the bereaved parents but does not want to 118 Early Childhood talk about the possibilities of it happening to them . It appears that this denial may be very important in sustaining the motivation , high energy , and sacrifice required to live day-to-day with a seriously deformed child . The Burned Child Roslyn Seligman No sooner had I entered the Intensive Care Unit than I caught myself leaving and stopped. * I realized that my behavior was in response to the atmosphere of tension and apprehension ! I remained for one hour and observed . Carl , 10 , is dying . He is on dialysis and does not respond to verbal stimuli . He appears in a great deal of distress . There is much activity and medical care around him , yet the sensed prognosis is dim and frus trating . Bob , 11 , is confused and disoriented as to his age , the time , and his father 's visit two days ago . As I question him , he gets upset and then sus pects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see him . Bob seems to be dealing with Carl , the dying patient , by identifying with the dying and then projecting his own behavior onto his dad in expecting that his dad will ignore him . Bob looks at a dried spot of blood on his leg and be-comes concerned that it will start bleeding . At the same time he com pulsively covers and uncovers his genitals . This same apprehension has kept him from sleeping last night . His apparent brain syndrome , which may be organic in burned patients , seems more likely an adaptive with drawal mechanism to this painful situation . Sam , 10 , is sleeping more 120 Early Childhood and Art , 15 , is complaining . Librium has assisted in keeping his anxiety within manageable limits . After observing , I talk with the nurses about this tense atmosphere . One nurse , recognizing my supportive and empathic position , acknowledged that the situation was so tense that she too had had to leave the Intensive Care Unit ( ICU ) for awhile this evening . In quarters as close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I talk with the captain of the evening shift , hoping that a focus on the apprehension of the nursing team might lessen their anxieties and hence those of the patients . Over the next three days , Carl improves ? he can follow verbal commands . At the same time the tense atmosphere diminishes and Bob 's confusion clears . Something new develops . Bob notes the condition of one of his hands , the less severely injured one . He speaks of how terrible it looks and complains of bugs crawling around it . His concern three days ago about his leg must have been a downward displacement of the apprehension he felt when he learned that parts of his fingers from both hands were missing . In addition , his concern about bleeding , likely related to anxiety about dying , is greater than his concern about his real mutilation . The next day Carl dies . A nursing note states : " There is comparatively little confusion surrounding this event . External cardiac massage and artificial respiration are administered . The other patients appear to be sleeping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His mother weeps loudly . The visit lasts five minutes . The curtains are pulled around his bed . Art is awake . Since the dying event , he has not asked for attention in any form and seems overly cheerful . His father visits this morning . " The morning after , another recently admitted 10-year-old , Brad , dies . The same procedure is followed . Art is on his abdomen and appears to be sleeping . His eyes are closed and he does n't answer when his name is called . An hour after the removal of Brad 's body from the ICU , Art asks his father , " Where 's Brad ? " The nurse , being unsure of the policy for telling patients of a death , replies , " Brad is n't here now . " Art drinks his provomalt and says no more . An hour later he asks if he too is going to die . He wants to know how many kids get out of the ICU . The nurse reassures him that Carl and Brad had been much sicker than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not get well . She also tells him that he is getting better and will soon move out of the ICU just as Bob and Sam have . His father is present and seems nervous but reinforces what she says . Art reveals his continued anxiety about dying in his curiosity about when he will go to the operating room , and he asks The Burned Child 121 repeatedly , " How many kids get out of here ? " He seems more relaxed and less demanding after his talk with the nurse , STUDY OF A BURN UNIT The material upon which this chapter is based comes from my observations as the child psychiatrist for children admitted to the Cincinnati Unit of the Shrine Burns Institute . In February 1968 the 30-bed Shrine Hospital opened , and my observations were made from that time until July 1972 . There I saw patients on rounds , for consultations , and chaired two weekly meetings with the nursing , social service and physical therapy staffs , the dietician , and the teacher contributing . Some families were interviewed either by me or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken verbatim from nursing observations , which were recorded in a log . We used the log to get a better picture of the children 's reactions and interactions within the group , a vivid and rich picture not fully appreciated by observations isolated in each individual patient 's chart . Plan of Procedure From the initial ICU scene of responses to a dying patient , I will now describe our unit and discuss some technical aspects of burns , such as mortality rate , total body surface ( TBS ) , total body burn ( TBB ) , full thickness burn ( FTB ) , and postburn day ( PBD ) . These technical aspects are important for the understanding of the expectations and anxieties of all those involved with burned children . Hereafter , the abbreviations TBS , TBB , FTB , and PBD will be used to represent the burn terminology . Also , the fraction TBB/FTB will follow the patient 's name and will represent the percentage of total body burn as the numerator and full thickness burn as the denominator . After briefly discussing the technical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the potentially dying patient . Some of these will have lived , some died . They will be divided further into those who were themselves grieving for the loss of a parent or sibling killed in the same fire . Others will be patients who responded to a death of another patient . Burns , like cancer , span all age and sex groups so that these cases will not be confined to any one age or sex . In one of our studies ( Seligman , Carroll , MacMillan 1971 ) , no survival trends related to age or sex were found . 122 Early Childhood Description of the Unit Children , 1-day-old to 16-years-old , are admitted to the unit for acute and reconstructive treatment of burns . The unit occupies one floor of the 4-floor hospital and consists of two mirror-image wards of 15 beds each . At certain times all patients in reconstructive treatment have been housed in one ward and all acute patients in the other ; at other times patients have been intermixed . Each ward has a central nursing station that is surrounded by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one 4-bed intensive care unit ( ICU ) , and three 1-bed rooms . The ICU has its own nursing personnel , separate from those of the rest of the ward . The outer sides of the patients ' rooms face a surrounding glass-enclosed , walkway visiting area ( Seligman , Carroll , MacMillan 1972 ) . Mortality Rate MacMillan states : " The mortality rate associated with flame burns in children is 25 percent , as opposed to 5 percent for hot liquids . In the absence of other associated injuries , thermal injury by itself has a predictable mortality . A child with a burn of 25 percent of the body surface will almost invariably survive in spite of inadequate therapy , whereas a burn of over 70 percent of the total body surface is associated with a mortality rate that is formidable under even the most optimal circumstances . In the 25 to 50 percent group , proper medico-surgical management will result in the survival of the majority of these patients " ( MacMillan 1972 ) . In a recent report ( National Commission on Fire Prevention and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Commission stated that of all the two-year-olds treated in general hospitals for second- and third-degree burns over 45 percent of the body , only 1 in 10 survives . Of the small proportion of these children who are treated in burn centers ( such as ours ) , more than 6 out of 10 survive . Among eight-year olds suffering second- and third-degree burns over 60 percent of the body , the national survival rate if only 2 out of 10 . In burn centers among patients in this category , half survive . In our unit , the mortality rate over two identical time periods , February 1968 through December 1969 and February 1970 through December 1971 , as correlated with TBB is illustrated in Figure 1 . In 14 of the 17 children who died in the 1968-69 period , the deaths occurred between postburn day 16 and 48 ( Seligman in press ) . Hence , my case material will include postburn day . The mortality rate of those ? 124 Early Childhood burned 40 percent and over TBS is further divided into a group burned 40 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over TBS ( Figure 2 ) . As can be seen from this figure , mortality rate is not a constant figure . Percentages of total body burn and full thickness burn in children over 15 years are determined by a simplified method of estimating the amount of body surface that is burned ? " the rule of nines " of Pulaski and Tennison . Each arm represents 9 percent ; each leg , 18 percent ; the anterior trunk , 18 percent ; the posterior trunk , 18 percent ; the head and neck , 9 percent ; and the perineal region , 1 percent . The method of Lund and Browder ( Manteuffel , Berkich 1969 ) is used in children under 15 years to account for their growth and , hence , their changing body proportions . Full thickness burn , according to Manteuffel and Berkich ( 1969 , p. 4 ) , " involves the destruction of all epithelial elements and is characterized by a dry , pearly white , or charred anesthetic surface " They further state , " Diagnosis of the depth of the burn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the skin varies according to both its location and the age of the patient . " In consideration of the factors relevant to mortality rate and the difficulty in assessing percent of full thickness burn , we acknowledge that all large burns 40 percent and over TBS are potentially dying patients . This fact is known among all staff , and quickly comes to be known by the patients and their families . These patients are admitted to the ICU where tensions are high until patients become well enough to move out . RESPONSES TO DEATH AND DYING BY PATIENTS WHO LIVED Earlier I described the responses of Bob and Sam to Carl , the dying patient . Bob and Sam had been together 23 days in the ICU prior to Carl 's admission , on their 38th PBD . Both boys had had losses ; Bob lost his mother , brother , and a friend in the car accident in which he was burned , and Sam lost a friend in an accident just prior to his own injury . The conversations of these patients were filled with themes related @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conversations Sam had with the nurse , one on PBD 24 and the other on PBD 38 . I found it interesting that Sam took 14 days after talking of Bob 's losses before he could speak of his own . His own death anxiety is revealed as he identifies partially with his friend who died . This is seen in his concern about the doctor not being available . 126 Early Childhood Excerpts of conversations during that 14-day interval are given to help us sense the atmosphere that Sam 61 /61 ( in the high mortality group ) ? had td tolerate . The conversations also reveal why a dying patient who dies intensifies the anxieties with which these patients have been actively dealing . When Bob ( 40/28 ) , age 11 , has been taken to the operating room , Sam ( 61/61 ) , age 10 , inquires , " Nurse , is it true that Bob 's mom died ? Does he know about it ? " Fourteen days later , PBD 38 , Sam told the nurse that the day before he was burned , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his who died in an auto accident . He said that a doctor was at the accident and took care of this boy 's brother . When the doctor finished with the boy 's dressing , he left . Sam said that this was why his friend had died . The nurse , sensing what Sam 's anxiety was about , responded by saying , " We are going to take real good care of you , and there is a doctor here all the time . " Sam replied that he knew this . Excerpts : PBD 25 ( for both boys ) Bob : Nurse , do you know my mother was killed in the accident ? Guess she went through the windshield . She was so good . Will you call my dad ? I must talk to my dad . Cover my peep ( penis ) . I wish I could get up ( said to another patient who was getting up in a wheelchair ) . I would not cry . Will you ( to that patient ) pray for my mom ? ( Then spoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) Jim 's my brother . I will have to ask him to move my hand . It is falling down ( had been complaining of pain in his badly burned hands ) . PBD 26 : Bob : Get the doctors in here . Nurse : They have already been here . Bob : Well , they should be in here doing their work on us . I want out of this bed because this one is burning up . PBD 27 : Bob : Get me out of here . I am tangled up in wires . My legs are in a vacuum cleaner and it squeezes them . Sam : Shut up , Bob . You are crazy . Get me some earplugs . Bob : I want to get out of here because this room is going to explode in flames and I will go up in flames . Sam : ( to nurse ) Do you think these burns will make my urine sterile ? ( We later learned he had seen a television show where a man became sterile after having mumps . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Can I go today ? Nurse : No . The Burned Child 127 Bob : Tell my dad to come and see me . Daddy , daddy . ( later ) I am sorry for screaming so loud . I have to do this once in awhile at home to let off steam . PBD : 33 : Bob : ( talking of accident ) Luckily , I am going to be all right . ( later ) Why ca n't I have a drink of water ? Nurse : You are going to surgery . Bob : But , I am not Bob , I am Jim , Bob 's brother . I am eight years old and the baby of the family . Nurse : Where is Bob ? Bob : I do not know . Bob , Bob . Nurse : What grade are you in ? Bob : He is in the second , he is little . Nurse : Who are you ? Bob : I am Bob . RESPONSES OF A BURNED GIRL , HER FATHER , AND THE UNIT STAFF Martha ( 53/49 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was burned when she got too close to her mother 's Christmas gift , a commercial fireplace . Her mother , who had been ill for 18 months following the discovery of a lump in her breast ( carcinoma ) , was admitted to the hospital four days prior to the patient 's burn . Since the mother was known also to have a growing brain tumor , our patient , the oldest of five children , was being groomed to take over her mother 's role . The patient 's father believed that Martha did not know of her mother 's tumor or of her mother 's death during our patient 's hospitalization . From her responses , I thought she did know . Martha 's father had described his wife as inadequate as a woman and not demonstrative . He described Martha as a tomboy and expressed concern that she would feel negative about being a woman . Responses to a Structured Interview Following are Martha 's responses during an interview : Dr. S. : Pretend you can have three wishes and state them . Martha : One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get well . I miss her , need her at home , and love her . And three ? for all of the family to stay well and together . It is lonely without everybody together . Dr. S. : When you grow up , what would you like to become ? Martha : An airline stewardess ( her father is a travel agent who travels a lot by plane ) . 128 Early Childhood Dr. S. : What one person would you take to a desert island ? Martha : Nobody . I do not want to take anybody else from the family . Dr. S. : Pretend you had a dream in which you felt ashamed . Martha : I ran away from home because I was mad at my mother for making me do the dishes . One day after admission ( 18th PI31 ) ) , the following nursing note was recorded : During her dressing change , Martha told me she had come downstairs in her nightgown to get warm by a gas logs fireplace . Her gown caught fire ; the babysitter failed to put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's for help . Martha thought of rolling in a blanket but was afraid , and besides she did not know where a blanket was . The sitter and neighbors returned and put out the fire by putting her in water in the bathtub . I thought that was a long time to be burning , but she said it was not because the neighbor lived only a few doors away . Her brothers ' and sister 's screaming and crying upset her more . I inquired where her parents were . She said her mother was a patient in the hospital and her father was visiting her mother . As to why her mother was in the hospital , she stated she did not know because she did not think her father wanted her to k:tow . Later a friend of the family visited . I told the visitor of my conversation with Martha . The visitor seemed surprised because she knew Martha 's father had told two of her brothers that the mother would not be returning home because she had a brain tumor and was not expected to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Martha speak of her mother returning home , either before her burn injury or since . Excerpts From Martha 's Clinical Course On her 24th PBD , Martha 's father surprised her by visiting a day earlier than expected . She cried , then asked about her mother . Her father said her mother was the same . ( Actually , her mother had died a few days before . ) Later that day during dressing change , the conversation was as follows : Martha : Daddy , I am sorry . I am a bad girl . Nurse : You are not a bad girl . Martha : Yes , I am bad and I am stupid . Nurse : Are you mad at yourself ? Martha : Yes . The Burned Child 129 PBD 28 : During whirlpool and dressing change : Nurse : Martha , cry instead of screaming . Martha : I can not cry . I do not know how to cry . Nurse : Could you cry before you were burned ? Martha : Yes , but I have not cried since . Nurse : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : I can not . I just do not know how to make tears . NURSE 'S NOTE . Martha is very uncomplaining . She grits her teeth and hyperventilates and then screams when the pain gets too severe . As soon as the episode is over , she immediately stops screaming . While being buttered , she screams only when touched . Last week patient stated , " It is n't fair ; it is n't fair . " She was referring to the pain she was going through . She further stated , " It feels like everybody is so mean and that they want to hurt me , but I know that they do n't . They all work so hard for me . " One patient in the ICU was moaning and groaning loudly , another was crying as blood was being drawn , and then Martha cried out , " I 'm going to die . " She continued , " Daddy come save me . I 'm sorry . " Two days later when Martha was being moved out of the ICU to a room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed , the patient who earlier had been crying asked , " Why are they moving Martha out ? " After the nurse explained , this patient replied , " Okay . " I think he was anxious that she had died and , if she had , that his crying had been the cause . ANOTHER NURSING NOTE . Martha 's course is slowly downhill . She has been alert but talking as though her tongue was very thick . She cries for her father and continues saying that she is sorry for everything , like putting us to so much trouble . I explain that this is our job and we are glad to help to get her better . Her father called last night and arrived at two A.M. He visited for an hour . An uncle visited for five minutes and left saying , " I can stay no longer . It is too much for me . " Her father returned and visited for a brief period . Later , Martha was apologetic for having fallen asleep during her father 's visit . She cried and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NOTE . I met Martha 's father in the gowning room . He asked me how Martha was , and he said , " It is only a matter of time , is n't it ? " I told him that we were doing our best and that the best we could do right now was to pray . He agreed . He was very emotionally 130 Early Childhood upset , shaking , and near tears . He visited alone briefly with Martha . I noticed he was sitting there crying silently , and so I joined him for awhile . I told him it was not necessary for him to stay , and he said he just wanted Martha to know he was there . I told him she knew . He replied yes and said he would be leaving . Ile lingered a few more minutes while crying and kissed her saying , " Goodbye Martha , I love you . " He left crying heavily . Fifteen minutes later she passed away . Reactions the Next Day The day following Martha 's death , the following note appears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continually starts screaming and sitting up in bed for no apparent reason . This time he was screaming for dad . When I asked him why , he said , " I am going to die . I am going to bleed to death and I want my daddy . " Even though this patient had not been in the ICU with Martha , he must have sensed the gloom that surrounded the unit in response to her death . Sixteen days later he celebrated his seventh birthday and was noted to be feeding himself and pleased with his birthday . On PBD 41 , three days later , he was noted to be in good physical condition . His parents visited and he ate a large meal . He then became nauseated , vomited , sat up in bed , turned blue , and once again cried out , " I 'm going to die , " and expired . The response to this unexpected tragedy is not noted in the log . I do not recall this patient . I do wonder if the unexpected and sudden death of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too much for the group to note our response , especially since Walter 's death followed so soon after Martha 's . RESPONSES OVER A 10-DAY-PERIOD TO TWO UNUSUAL , DEATHS The responses to the deaths of Bessie and Scot are separated into those of the staff , the other patients , families of the two children , and families of other burned children still living . This separation is for clarity , but the reader should remember that all of these actions and interactions were going on simultaneously , one response feeding into another , yielding a complex picture . The Burned Child 131 The Sudden and Unexpected Death : Responses of the Staff One Saturday evening Bessie ( 35/25 ) , a six-year-old , died on her 90th PBD . She was the Unit 's first death in a patient who had gotten better , moved out of the ICU , and was beginning to walk . The next morning the charge nurse called to tell me of Bessie 's death and to ask how to respond to the other patients who were beginning to ask questions . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learn more about the Unit responses to the death as well as to learn more about the issues that were inhibiting the nurses in handling the situation . As I talked with three nurses together , I realized they were identifying with the nurse who had been caring for Bessie last evening . They had some conflict around the issue of whether or not this nurse had been negligent , and they feared that other staff , patients , and their families might share this concern . One nurse kept saying , " Im afraid of what the children might ask . " When I asked what could be so terrible in the children 's questions , she answered by an association . She recalled that while she was caring for Bessie in the ICU , Bessie threw a temper tantrum , quit breathing , and turned blue for a moment . In other words , Bessie could easily have died under her care at an earlier time . During still another temper outburst in the ICU , Bessie had had to have her closed tracheostomy reopened . After looking at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feelings that she might have played a role in Bessie 's death , we were able to move on to more of the reality factors involved . Twenty minutes had elapsed between the time Bessie had been given her capsule and the time she had vomited and aspirated . Recognizing this somewhat relieved the nurses , who then were able to respond to the questions of some of the children , and the apprehension of others , who could not yet acknowledge what they had either observed , heard , or sensed . That evening I phoned the nurse who had been caring for the now deceased patient . She did not sound responsible for the death either in the description of her own feelings or of the event . She described having given the patient her capsule , which she swallowed , and then 20 minutes late complained that she was having trouble getting it down . Then she gave Bessie some bread ; Bessie began to request water , which she received . She demanded more water and then threw a temper tantrum , stopped breathing , and turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's chest , only to have fluid ooze from her mouth and 132 Early Childhood nose . With the failure of these resuscitation efforts , she was pronounced dead . Bessie had complained earlier of having trouble breathing but at that time was not cyanotic . Five days later in my regular staff meeting , Bessie 's death and its surrounding events were still disturbing to the Unit staff ; clearly they wanted to talk more about it . They asked what had happened and I indicated that their version of the story was as good as anyone else 's . With encouragement they were able to volunteer their ideas . Many thought the nurse caring for the deceased patient had been at fault . Only one of the nurses had been able to approach this nurse to ask directly about the event ; the others felt that asking would put the nurse on the spot . I saw this as a reflection of their own feelings that this nurse was responsible in some way . Excerpts from Bessie 's Life : Understanding Death Through Life Since Bessie should not have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days since being burned ) , the nursing staff and I explored the meaning of living ( versus dying ) for Bessie . We did this through looking at Bessie 's previous role and her anticipated role in her family . In the history was marital rift . At the time of the fire the evening Bessie was burned , her father was out . Her two-year-old brother , Shep , died in the fire . Prior to Bessie 's mother being able to visit her ( the mother was being treated elsewhere for burned hands ) , one nurse wrote , " There appears to be sincere love in this father for Bessie . " On an early PBD , Bessie 's father heard by phone from her mother that a television news item reported Bessie as having died . ( She had not . ) When her mother was able to join the father with Bessie , joy and sorrow prevailed . Together they cried over the loss of Shep and then sang , " Swing Low , Sweet Chariot . " Thereafter , mother and father talked frequently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appeared in newspapers across the country . Gifts poured in . When her mother would visit , even before asking how Bessie felt , she would say , " Oh , we got so many packages , Bessie . " Throughout , the message I heard the mother giving was that illness and death have more value than life . Responses to Bessie 's Death by Her Parents and Parents of the Other Burned Children Many of the families of our burned children live far away . To accommodate their visiting over a prolonged period , the Shrine Unit has found The Burned Child 133 a hoarding house within walking distance of the hospital . In this close living situation , these families share each other 's suffering , anxieties , and even some joyous moments . Each person 's response to the other is not only predicated by the daily events , including death and dying , but also on individual personalities and how they rub each other . Bessie 's mother had moved into the boarding house the evening before Bessie 's death . Following Bessie 's death , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ banged on the window , while screaming " My God , my God . " Those mothers in the boarding house whose children were getting better became apprehensive . They had had the feeling that after their child had gotten beyond the acutely ill stage , they could give a sigh of relief . This unexpected death on a 90th PBD reawakened all previous parental fears . Now the feeling was one of hopelessness . Each became concerned that her child might do the same as Bessie . One of the mothers , closely attached to her seven-year old son , fainted in our lobby prior to visiting her son . We had been trying to loosen this attachment , but this event only cemented it . Her son 's response was to have abdominal pains . Responses by the Other Patients Having presented Bessie 's death , the responses of the nurses , the behavior of her mother , and the intensified apprehension of the other parents , we can now view the responses of the other children within the context of this social interaction . In general , two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they knew by asking questions or they acted as if they knew nothing and wished not to know . In the room next to Bessie were three boys . They had witnessed the behavior of Bessie 's mother . Sam ( 61/61 ) asked questions ; his two younger roommates could do so only a day later . A nine-year-old boy ( 41/18 ) in a recovery stage , who had observed the resuscitative efforts , could also ask questions ; Bessie 's roommate , a six-year-old , could not talk about her observations . Jean , a teen-ager in the ICU , asked questions ; Scot ( 55/47 ) , a 14-year-old , was much sicker and did not appear to know . Two days later , Scot and a nurse conversed . Scot : I am glad that little girl died like she did . She died like my daddy , instantly . Nurse : What little girl , Scot ? Scot : Bessie . May I have some water ? 1 34 Early Childhood Nurse : . lust one minute , please . Scot : I wish every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , Scot . Scot was injured in an auto accident in which his father burned to death at the wheel . The man who pulled Scot from his jammed seat belt said , " You 're lucky . That man at the wheel burned to death . " Scot would vacillate between grieving the loss of his father and deny ing that his father was dead . However , his unconscious never denied that death . He continually dreamed of his father bursting into flames as he was reaching out to him . While having much pain on his 15th P13I ) , Scot conversed with the nurse . Scot : I want to die and I will try all day tomorrow to kill myself . Is my father okay ? Is he dead ? My mother told me he was not , but I 'm not sure . I believe her . Nurse : You will have to ask your mother . Scot : Please show me the pictures of my father . NURSE 'S NOTE . Was unable to reassure Scot and calm him . After receiving Demerol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's death , his surgical resident and he became very attached . Scot told this doctor that he had replaced his father . The doctor rotated to another service shortly after Bessie 's death . Scot responded by saying that he could not deal with losing two fathers in one month . Several days later he told his mother that he was praying to die and hoped to join his father . He asked if she would forgive him . She prayed with him . He also learned that he would have two stubs for hands and might lose a leg . He told her that most of his life he had been ridiculed for being fat , and now he could not take the ridicule he anticipated for having two stubs and one leg . Two days later , while talking to the doctor , he suddenly stopped breathing . Resuscitation attempts failed . Five days before Scot 's death , his legs showed no evidence of Pseudo monas ( a bacterial ) infection . At autopsy he had Pseudomonas infection on his legs , but " surprisingly there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the prosector stated . Even though Scot 's 57-year-old mother and I had excellent rapport , her communication that she wanted to see me the day before his death never reached me . No nursing notes were recorded in the log revealing Scot 's desire to join his father . The Burned Child 135 Scot 's mother looks at life in a very realistic fashion . She exuberates both warmth and hardness in that she feels that if you really love someone you can not wish for them to live and be a cripple if that would bother them . She felt that his death was really the best answer to his prayers . She explained this by telling me about his family and their " sensitivities . " These sensitivities referred to suicide attempts and successful suicides in members of the family . I sensed she had communicated to him what I was hearing ; namely , that it might be better if Scot did not get well because she might not be able to tolerate having a crippled son . She feared that she did not have many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commit suicide as had other relatives . She much preferred the natural death that occurred . Unit Responses the Next Day Mike ( 41/18 ) , whose mother had been close to Scot 's , and Sam asked questions about who was in the ICU . Only gradually could they ask directly about Scot . Mike would ask his mother where Scot 's mother was . Our approach was to answer these questions simply and truthfully . We did not tell the sick children who were not asking ; we felt not asking meant " I am not ready to hear . " Jean , the teen-ager , said how brave Scot was with all his burns . Now she seemed ashamed to complain . During dressing change she stated , " Scot , oh Scot . Where 's Scot ? " She was asked what she meant . She replied , " I know he is in heaven with his dad , but where are they keeping him ? His mother is so brave . She is such a wonderful woman . " Two days later Sam and I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He thought waiting until they asked would be better because telling them before they were ready might be too upsetting . . PERSONAL RESPONSES Two other cases I wish to comment about briefly are a 14-year-oldboy , Tim ( 87/44 ) , and a five-year-old girl , Beth ( 47/43 ) . Tim was remarkable , as was the staff 's response to him . In spite of extensive burns , operations , and amputations , he survived for 55 days . On the day he returned from the operating room with his scalp covered by a surgical dressing ( his scalp had been the only site of his body previously without an injury ) , the nursing staff was shocked and angered . Their anger was directed at the surgeon . They felt that Tim had been through so much 136 Early Childhood that injuring the only untouched spot was unfair . Shortly thereafter , Tim died . I believe he sensed the change in the nurses ' attitudes and then gave up his hope and desire to live . In contrast to Tim 's intense relationship with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ related only to her older sister , who traveled 3(X) miles to visit , but she was not part of Beth 's current household ; no other family member came . Her mother had no phone . Beth showed no desire to live ; she lingered until her quiet death . The deaths of all the children described affected me , but two were especially difficult . The one that was most painful and still has effects today , many years later , is Scot , who prayed to die . His qualities , to which I could make meaningful associations within my own life , made my response to his dying and death an intense one . My understanding then of the dynamics of my response did not lessen the pain . In his feelings about being painfully teased about his obesity , I could identify with a favored relative . In his desire to be an oceanographer and contribute to science , I saw that which I value . In his mother I saw the strength , warmth , and concern for her child that reminded me of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I talked with his mother , she did not weep ; I did . Months later when she visited and called , we had dinner together . With no other family has that occurred . My failure to help Scot was troublesome to me as a doctor , whose role is to help people live , and especially to me as a psychiatrist , whose role was to help Scot deal with his grief about his father . In both of these , I had to accept my failure . My associations with this family intensified the loss . I received some comfort from his mother 's position ; I knew she understood Scot enough to judge what was best for him . Even so , when at dinner that evening she talked of her loneliness , I knew she was in the midst of her own grief work . In contrast to Scot , I never knew Beth ; she never gave me a chance . Again , I was a failure but in a different way . The frustration and disappointment of not being able to help a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fortunately for us on the Unit , we meet some who through their will to live let us help . For example I was called to see a teen-age boy , Ralph , burned over 90 percent TBS , the result of an industrial accident . He had requested to see himself in the mirror , and the nurse wanted to know whether he should or not . After talking with Ralph , I said , " Let him do whatever he wishes . " In my interview with him I was impressed with his strengths and ability to accept his position . Later I called to ask what his response had been . The nurse stated he said , " Gee , it 's not as bad as I thought it was going to be . " This boy came from a very warm , close The Burned Child 137 family . His mother was caring for him each day . His girlfriend , as well , faithfully visited . Ralph emphasizes my impression that we can help those patients who through their families or through our staff find enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Scot and Beth emphasize that those who do not have hope for whatever reason do not live no matter what our efforts are . In summary , I have presented variations on the living , dying , and death theme in a burned child 's life . I have seen , as I have tried to indicate by case material , many different ways of coping or not coping . In my own opinion , we have not adequately studied dying and death . Neither have we dealt adequately with the dying patients and their families . In the Shrine Unit , when the child dies , the family returns home . I have no follow-up data except in Scot 's instance to say whether or not these families are able to grieve adequately . Money and profes sional time for and interest in dealing with the emotional understanding and needs of burned children and their families have lagged far behind the medico-surgical advances . Three of my previous studies ( Seligman , Carroll , MacMillan 1972 ; Seligman in press ; Seligman , MacMillan , Carroll 1971 ) report @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remedy the situation . 11 Childhood Leukemia* Brenda D. Townes / David A. Wald In the past two decades , there has been about a 50 percent increase in the incidence of cancer in childhood . Accompanying this increased frequency , the life-span in childhood leukemia has been increased from an average of three months to a current median of over 21 months . Thus , replacing the past expectation of imminent death , parents of a youngster with leukemia are now exposed to the prolonged anxiety of a critically ill child for whom painful medical procedures , hospitalizations , remissions , and ultimate death are predicted . In a seminar in 1965 , the director of the hematology program at Children 's Orthopedic Hospital and Medical Center in Seattle asked , " Why do some families and some individuals within families disintegrate in the presence of prolonged illness and death of a child with leukemia ? Why do other families appear to draw closer together ? Can mental health professionals help by identifying factors that facilitate and interfere with adjustment to the death of a family member ? " Participants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death ; it is not a researchable question ? " ADAPTATION OF FAMILIES TO LEUKEMIA STUDY A few months later , in the summer of 1965 , a three-year investigation was initiated to study the adaptation of families to a child with leukemia . Parental interviews and multiple tests and questionaires were completed *This work was supported in part by grants MH 12548 and CA 04937 from the USPHS , and grant 5 107A66 from NIH. 138 Childhood Leukemia 139 by eight families at yearly intervals . Findings have been reported elsewhere concerning parental ( Townes , Wold , Holmes in press ; Wold , Townes 1969 ) and medical staff ( Wallace , Townes 1969 ) responses to the dying child . This chapter discusses the impact of the degree of parental communication about the diagnosis and prognosis of childhood leukemia upon siblings ' adaptation to the dying process . Subjects Sixteen families , each with a child under treatment for leukemia at the I lematology ( blood study ) and Oncology ( tumor study ) Division located at Children 's Orthopedic Hospital and Medical Center , were approached to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ illness and death of a child . Of the 16 families , 4 had no healthy siblings , 2 did not wish to participate in the study , and 2 had only one sibling less than two years of age . The remaining 8 families , with a total of 22 healthy siblings , were followed at yearly intervals . At the onset of the study , 6 out of 8 of the children with leukemia were of preschool age , two were of school age . Five were males , 2 females , and the data on the last child was incomplete . Of the 22 healthy siblings , 3 were 4 years of age or less , 11 were between the ages of 5 and 8 years , and 8 children were 9 years of age or over . There were 10 males and 12 females among the siblings . Methods The healthy siblings of the children who had leukemia were tested individually during the summers of 1965 , 1966 , and 1967 ; this was on the average approximately 10 , 20 , and 32 months , respectively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the Communication Questionnaire each sibling 's knowledge that the child with leukemia was ill , had leukemia , and might die ; parents indicated how much the sibling had been told , how much the sibling had asked questions , and how much the parents thought the sibling knew about his or her brother 's or sister 's disease . Both parents completed for each sibling the Symptom Checklist ( Wimberger , Gregory 1968 ) , a quantitative measurement of each sibling 's academic and interpersonal adjustment . The sibling then estimated on the Silhouette Test ( Colvin 1964 ) the adequacy of his or her own and the ill child 's health and his or her expectation concerning the longevity of him- or herself and the child with leukemia.
