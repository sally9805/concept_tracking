txt Harvey and Dorothy Doss , a Michigan couple making about $26,000 a year , thought they had a formula for sending their tour children through college . With scholarship aid and other financial assistance , they figured that their own outlays could be held to $3.000 a year Der child . Barbara , their oldest , went off to Kenyon College in Gambier , Ohio , where she now is a sophomore . Tuition , room , board and other fees total about $5,700 . She got enough scholarship and other aid to bring her parents ' bills down to $3,650 , including spending money . " That 's more than we figured on , " Dorothy Doss said , " but we think we can still do it . " Now , however , the Dosses have run into trouble . Their next oldest , Jean , has been accepted for admission next fall to Syracuse University . Tuition , room , board and fees there total $5,770 . Like her sister , Jean applied for enough financial help to bring the family 's expense down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to what the Dosses wanted The reason : At $26,000 a year , the Dosses have too big an income to qualify for so much aid from Syracuse But they figure that without that much aid , they ca n't afford to send Jean to Syracuse . Costs Up 70% Since 1970 Like millions of other American families making from $12,000 to , say , $40,000 a year , the Dosses are caught in a tightening squeeze in higher education Because of the skyrocketing costs of college , these families , need help . Because of their incomes , they ca n't get it  --  at any rate , not enough of it . Since 1970 , total costs of college , not counting spending money , have climbed more than 70% , to a median of $2,790 a year at state-run schools and $4,568 at private colleges , according to the College Scholarship Service , the branch of the College Entrance Examination Board that establishes the generally accepted standards on financial-aid eligibility . Parents usually file income and savings statements with the service , which makes the statements available to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state , federal and company aid programs designed to help meet the soaring costs . They are based on need , which means that the lion 's share goes to students from lower-income families , with little left over for the middle class .

Starting at about $12,000 , the higher your income the harder It is to get help . The crunch really begins at $20,000 a year . Those making at least 00,000 can rely on little outside help at all , except for the local Rotary , ' Chiming or Woman 's Club scholarship , which usually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the difficulty should be noted : The straight-A student active in school affairs can get plenty of aid , no matter what his family 's income , authorities say . " Those kids do n't apply to college ; they get recruited by the colleges , " a high-school guidance counselor says . But for the families of most collegebound students , the already tight financial situation is likely to get worse . Oakland PInancial Group Inc. , a personal-finance consulting firm , estimates that the higher-education bill for today 's 14-year-old high-school freshman will be $5,522 a year at a state college and $9,665 at a private university . For today 's 8-year-old , the firm calculates , the annual cost will be $7,677 at a state college and $12,662 at a private one . These projections do n't include pin money and they assume no increase in the inflation rate . " Admit-Deice " Formula Clearly , college-financing problems have reached " worrisome proportions , " says John Kemeny , president of Dartmouth College . He says that most schools , unable to provide all the help that families @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " admit-deny " formula ; that is , they admit the students but deny them the required financial assistance . " It 's tantamount to denying admission in the first place , " he says . Dartmouth , Harvard and some other colleges are Vying to do something about this . Dartmouth has a " custom-tailored " financial aid program intended to make sure that any student admitted for academic reasons wo n't have to opt out for financial reasons . " It 's the opposite of the admit-deny formula , " Mr. Kemeny says . After seeing a 10% drop in middle-income students last year , Harvard started a pilot program of low-interest loans-8% compared with about 12% for conventianal loans  --  to families earning between $15,000 and $50,000 a year . The loans are repayable over six years . At least five other schools are phasing in loans similar to Harvard 's and carrying interest rates of 8% to 8%% . They are Amherst , Bryn Mawr , Cornell University 's School of Hotel Administration , Pomona College and Stanford . Yale has come up with a program it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ student to repay loans after college at a rate based on his income One reason that more people are feeling the higher-education squeeze is simply that more people are demanding a college education . The Conference Board , a nonprofit economic-research organization , estimates college enrollment at 11 million and climbing , compared with just three million in 1960 . " More people expect to send their children , so more people are aware that it is costly , " says Michael , an economist at Williams College who studies higher-education costs . William Brennan of Longmeadow , Mass , is more than aware of the situation ; he is bitter about it " Sometimes I think my kids would be better off if I made less money , " he says . Mr. Brennan , the father of three children , is a section manager at a rollerchain plant in nearby Springfield He makes between $30,000 and $35,000 a year . By most people 's reckoning , that 's a good paycheck . Mr. Brennan says , " I may be a good manager at the plant , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has little savings in the bank After paying federal and state taxes , the Brennans are hit with more than $2,000 a year in mortgage payments , another $2,000 for property taxes and " one heck of a lot of money " for such necessities as food , heating fuel and insurance . ( The Brennans own two cars  --  a 1966 Chevrolet and a 1971 Oldsmobile , both paid for ) Indeed , a rundown of the Brennan family ledger shows little surplus , " and we do n't live the high life , " Mr. Brennan says . Still , his income precludes any state , federal or college financial aid for the Brennan 's son , Bill , completing his second year at Holy Cross College in Worcester , Mass . The tab for tuition , room , board and " pocket money , which really builds up , " is more than $5,000 a year , Mr Brennan says . Last summer Bill made about $1,200 as a clerk in a bookstore and used some of his meager savings This brought the Brennan family 's tab down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ credit union at 10% interest to be paid in one year , in monthly installments of about $320 The crunch , though , will come next year when the Brennans ' daughter Sheila , an honor student in high school , also tries to attend Holy Cross . If she ca n't get financial aid and if costs rise as expected , Mr Brennan could be facing a monthly bill of well over $750 , or more than $9,000 a year , for the two collegians . " What really gets me is Sheila gets good marks in school because she wants to get scholarships , " Mr Brennan says " But if she ca n't get a scholarship because of my income , then what kind of incentive is that for a kid to study hard ? " A Case of Overreach ? While many may sympathize with the plight of the Dosses and Brennan , some others do n't Many college administrators and other authorities say the situation is n't nearly so bad as it 's often painted For one thing , they say , some parents could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ send two or more of their children through college at the same time , without being willing to make such personal sacrifices as remortgaging their homes or selling one of the family cars . " I 'm alarmed at the changing attitude in this country , " says Jonathan D. Fife , associate director of a higher-education study group at George Washington University in Washington " People in the middle class used to be willing to give up anything to help , but today they wo n't give up anything . " Richard Z. , a $25,000-a-year store manager outside Los Angeles , bemoaning the high cost of putting his two sons through college , says he ca n't contribute anything from his personal savings account because " we finally have enough to renovate our basement . " The renovation includes transforming the basement into a 19205-style speakeasy . " We entertain a lot , " Mr. Z. says . Parents who have conscientiously saved money for college are frequently jarred to find the savings taken into account by college-aid administrators . The savers are entitled to less assistance than families @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was really surprised when I found that out , " says Mrs. Victoria Lodoly of St. Louis , whose two sons commute to St. Louis University . She says she and her husband , George , a brewer for Anheuser-Busch , " always tried to put a little away because we knew our children would be going to college some day . " One of her sons received a small scholarship , but neither was entitled to other help , principally because the Lodolys ' income is around $30,000 a year and they have a savings account . Some observers discount the talk of overreach and unwillingness to sacrifice . " We 're talking about the term liquidity " says William Cavanaugh , an official of the College Scholarship Service . " People appear to be richer , but their resources are n't liquid , they 're tied up with bills and other payments . " What 's more , the term " middle class " covers a wide area , says Nicholas Ryan , financial aid director at Grinnell College , situated amid cornfields outside Des Moines . " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sell a couple of acres a year to put his children through college ? " Declarations of Independence One way to right back is to declare your children independent . A student who lives away from home can use his own income , not his parents ' , as the basis for seeking financial aid . This technique has n't spread much . The College Scholarship Service says the percentage of students declared self-supporting has risen  --  but only slightly , and mainly because more people in their middle or late 205 are beginning college these days . Cutting the apron strings can pay off , says John of Springfield , Masc . His daughter Sherry was n't eligible for financial aid when she entered Framingham ( Maas . ) State College three years ago . She married a student at the school , and now , her father says , " she can get financial help from the school or state if she wants . " Moat authorities agree that , severe or not , the middle-class squeeze is forcing parents to become more selective  --  and realistic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of such families are the Dosses of Michigan . After denial of aid from Syracuse , daughter Jean has decided to go to the University of Michigan , which is in her home town of Ann Arbor and has a tuition of $904 a year for state residents . Still , her parents , Harvey Doss , a pilot for an air-freight carrier , and Dorothy , a nurse , say they are " a little crushed . " Michigan is a good school , " but we always felt that part of the education process was to live away from home , to meet new people in a different environment , " Mrs Doss says . " I guess we 'll have to give that up .
