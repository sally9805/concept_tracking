Figuratively as well as literally , bomb making is a boom-and-bust business . Last year it was bust for Norris Industries of Vernon , Calif. , one of the biggest and busiest U.S. makers of casings and other metal hardware for bombs , mortar shells and artillery projectiles . The reduction of the American war effort in Viet Nam cut Norris ' military sales by more than a third , though they still accounted for 28% of the company 's total revenues of $272 million . Now the boom seems likely to resume with the intensification of U.S. bombing in Southeast Asia . In the first nine months of the Government 's current fiscal year , Norris received $81 million worth of ordnance contracts , and it has another major contract pending . <P> Constructive Change . Happily for Norris , however , war is no longer essential to its prosperity . Since 1965 , Kenneth Norris Jr. , son of the company 's founder and now its chief executive , has been using military profits to buy a string of firms that make such civilian products as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acquisitions may not have freed the company from volatile shifts in sales and profit . Most of the new businesses that it has entered are related to home building , which in the past has suffered up and down swings almost as extreme as those in weapons manufacturing . Right now , however , Norris has hit the civilian market at a good time : residential building has helped lead the U.S. economy 's recovery from the 1970 recession . The construction surge played a major part in pushing Norris ' profits up 34% last year , to $16 million , despite the slump in its military work . <P> The current conversion to civilian products is the second major change that Norris has made in the nature of its business . The company , founded in 1930 , began life as a maker of magic coins , trick mirrors , chauffeurs ' badges and dispensers for toilet paper and soap . Before World War II , however , it developed the first seamless cartridge casing , and by V-J day it had " produced more kinds and sizes of artillery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company brochure . During the Korean conflict , Norris operated the largest single plant producing cartridge cases for the U.N . forces , and the increased U.S. involvement in Viet Nam caused it to build two new ordnance-making plants in the mid-1960s , raising the total to five . <P> Price of Peace . In the past , Norris has paid a high price in peacetime for its war wealth . Its profits dropped dramatically after World War II . That could happen again when the Viet Nam War ends , but the switch to civilian production makes that much less likely than it would have been a few years ago . The laconic Kenneth Norris argues further that " people tend to forget that tank and artillery crews are always burning up shells in training . "
