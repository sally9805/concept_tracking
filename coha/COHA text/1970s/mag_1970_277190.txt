An army in which civilians do the housekeeping chores . A radar technician never washes dishes . A helicopter mechanic never mows the parade grounds . There are no inspections on Saturday mornings to delay enjoyment of a weekend pass . No one stands in line for anything for more than 15 minutes . The purpose of each training exercise is explained so clearly that even the most dim-witted recruit gets the point . Above all , each man is a soldier because he wants to be one . <P> A master sergeant 's alcoholic reverie ? Not at all . That vision of the future U.S. Army was soberly presented last week by the Pentagon as a realistic goal to be achieved within three years as part of an all-out drive to make the U.S. armed forces consist solely of volunteers . Ideally , Selective Service would be reduced to a stand-by status , its machinery available only in an emergency requiring an unusual mobilization of manpower . <P> The big guns lined up behind the plan . Defense Secretary Melvin Laird announced that he had ordered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immediately ; Army Chief of Staff William Westmoreland vowed that " unnecessary irritants and unattractive features of Army life " will be eliminated as quickly as possible ; and Laird 's top manpower assistant , Roger T. Kelley , spent 90 minutes briefing newsmen on the program . <P> Pay Inducement . That kind of Pentagon commitment to a volunteer Army represents more of a yielding to political pressures than a solid conviction that the idea is sound . As one means of alleviating antiwar sentiment in the <P> U.S. , President Nixon pledged in the 1968 campaign to work toward such a force . Privately , top Pentagon officials have opposed the plan , mainly because they doubt that they could get enough money from Congress to make the Army attractive to the kind of volunteer that a modern , highly mechanized force requires . Many generals still , are skeptical , but they are now willing to try . <P> To make the plan work , Westmoreland said , the current rate of recruitment and re-enlistment must be at least douled and possibly tripled . This will be difficult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ potential volunteers . At present , the Army figures that only about 40% of its volunteers would have enlisted if they had not feared that they would be drafted anyway . <P> To overcome volunteers ' reluctance , the Pentagon stressed higher pay as a major attraction . A recent pay increase raised the salary of new recruits in all services to $124.50 a month ; Laird proposed that by next January it be jumped again to $149.40 . Kelley suggested that added pay of $30 to $150 a month be given to soldiers and Marines who volunteer for the least desirable duties with infantry , artillery or armor units , which normally come under fire in combat . This would be on top of present hostile fire pay . <P> Better housing , especially for enlisted families and bachelors , who often complain of a lack of privacy , is also promised by the Pentagon . So is an expansion of the Army 's many educational programs . The toughest task of all may simply be to make daily military life more enjoyable , without impairing service efficiency or discipline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
