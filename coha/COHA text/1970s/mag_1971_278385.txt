When Secretary of State William H. Seward bought Alaska from Russia in 1867 , his critics quickly asked : Who wants 375 million acres of " icebergia , " good only for a few " wretched fish " - even at $7.2 million , or 2 an acre ? The answer is now plain : everyone . Most Alaskans see the state as a treasure house of minerals , including the huge North Slope oil reserves on the edge of the Beaufort Sea . Ardent conservationists yearn to protect as much as possible of America 's last great wilderness . But standing in the way of fulfilling anyone 's wishes was a knotty legal hitch . <P> What Seward purchased was not land , but only the right to tax and administer it . Ownership remained in the hands of Alaska 's Eskimos , Aleuts and Indians , who now number some 55,000 . Starting in 1959 , they pressed their ancient claims . Last week , after years of sporadic haggling , Congress passed a bill to resolve the issue . If the natives approve it , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law by President Nixon this week . <P> Generous Settlement . Under the bill 's complex terms , the natives will receive title to 40 million acres throughout the state . To settle the rest of their claims , they will be paid $962.5 million - $500 million from mining royalties and $462.5 million from federal appropriations over eleven years . Twelve regional and 220 village corporations will invest the money to pay dividends to the natives and start a series of social programs . <P> As one critic sees it , the settlement amounts to " the second purchase of Alaska . " It nonetheless seems fair on two counts . In Alaska , rural natives need what seems like exorbitant space merely to subsist . Moreover , Congress was clearly trying to compensate for past inequities that it has inflicted on America 's aborigines . <P> Different Bonanza . Conservationists are generally happy with the bill . One provision allows Interior Secretary Rogers Morton to select 80 million acres of some of the loveliest land in the world for national parks , forests and wildlife refuges . For the state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind . Alaska has already set aside for state development 26 million acres , including some on the North Slope . The bill now frees state officials to choose another 77 million acres , and they are sure to favor areas that are rich in natural resources . <P> Most important to Alaska 's economy , the bill in effect removes a barrier to the proposed $2 billion trans-Alaska oil pipeline from the North Slope fields to the ice-free port of Valdez . The oil companies have been desperate to get on with the job ; costs of waiting have been estimated at $400,000 per day . The big question now is whether the 789-mile-long pipeline can be built with sufficient safeguards to protect Alaska 's environment .
