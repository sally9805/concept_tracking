Take Me Out to the Ball Game <P> To the Editors : <P> <P> Babe Ruth and Yankee Stadium symbolize the all-time greats of the national game April 26 . Babe Ruth started his career as a pitcher , but in the American League today pitchers never come to bat . This great talent would never have been discovered today . Let 's get rid of that " designated hitter " rule and a new great batting talent might be discovered . <P> Charles F. Post Pacific Grove , Calif . <P> Every time a batter gets a hit off Andy Messersmith or any other million-dollar pitcher , he should be given a raise simply because a million-dollar pitcher should be unhittable . <P> Sunil Thomas Queens , N.

In all , nearly 40 major leaguers have played for the Fanners . The Fairbanks team won the National Baseball Congress championship in ' 72 , ' 73 and ' 74 , and nearly repeated in 1975 before being nosed out by those archrivals from the " Deep South , " the Anchorage Glacier-Pilots . <P> Larry Gedney Ester , Alaska <P> Million-Dollar Manager <P> It looks like Mr. Hughes ' take-home average was more than $3.6 million a month during his working years April 19 .

Those crimes most damaging to our society , corporate , whitecollar , governmental and organized crimes , are conveniently ignored . The real criminals are not , as Wilson would have us believe , burglars , thieves , or those who have otherwise developed " deformed personalities . " The real criminals are those who have manipulated the growing interpenetration of the political and economic spheres of our society . <P> Discussing crime in America in terms of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking for fun and profit " is simplistic and misleading . <P> Ivor O.
