THE GENTLE BARBARIAN by V.S. PRITCHETT 243 pages . Random House . $10 . <P> <P> Dostoyevsky thought him a haughty poseur ; the Goncourt brothers found him an amiable giant . He wrangled with Tolstoy , befriended Zola , intrigued Carlyle , enchanted Henry James . He was at once a hunter of game and celebrity , a well-traveled man of letters , and a provincial Russian . Ivan Turgenev 's life is several lives , and by now several biographies should have recounted them . Yet , as Critic V.S. Pritchett notes , there has not been a definitive biography of Turgenev in any language . <P> Until now . This brisk , critical Life operates under a great handicap : Pritchett does not read Russian ; literary and biographical sources come almost entirely from translations . But the author has the compensating virtues of insight and wit . Turgenev 's oeuvre has long been accessible to an English-speaking audience ; The Gentle Barbarian at last makes the neglected author as approachable as his work . <P> Unpredictable Virago . Ivan 's father , an impoverished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get away from his wife . Turgenev 's mother was a wealthy , unpredictable virago who alternately punished and indulged her serfs and sons . " Children brought up under a tyranny , " observes Pritchett , " spoiled one moment and beaten the next are likely to be evasive and to lead a double life . " Ivan , Mama 's favorite , always existed on two planes : the imaginative and the real . On the first he succeeded ; on the second he foundered for six decades . <P> Turgenev began his career as a narrative poet . He was later to describe his verse as " dirty tepid water . " But it served to attract influential critics , and propelled him to local prominence . Like many in his privileged caste , Ivan furthered his education in Western Europe . On the Continent , the perpetual bachelor commenced the affair that was to last a lifetime . Heinrich Heine provides the best description of Prima Donna Pauline Viardot : " Her ugliness is of a kind that is noble and , if I might almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great lion-painter Delacroix . " She was married - and remained married-to Louis Viardot , a prosperous litterateur . Viardot and Turgenev met and found much in common : an interest in writing , bird shooting and Pauline . <P> An amalgam of these categories brought Turgenev his widest recognition . Enraptured by the Spanish singer , he reached back for lyric memories of his rural Russian youth . The Sportsman 's Sketches provides a landscape with figures-peasants and hunters who wander in a remote and somehow doomed pastorale . The book was to become a profound influence on Hemingway , and Poet Randall Jarrell called its evocations of the countryside " the best of all possible worlds . " Pritchett agrees . " There are two masters of seeing in Russian literature , " he observes . " Tolstoy sees exactly as if he were an animal or a bird : and what he sees is still and settled for good . He has the pride of the eye . Turgenev is also exact but without that decisive pride : what he sees is already changing . " A country daybreak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , crimson at first and later brilliantly red , brilliantly golden . Everything began quivering into life , awakening , singing , resounding , chattering .
