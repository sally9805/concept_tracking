Mr. Leiter , formerly a newspaper man in the South and Midwest , is now on the faculty of the University of Tennessee . Knoxville A large sign on U.S. 11 , inside the city limits of Sweetwater , in east Tennessee , announces boldly that " Birds of a Feather Flock Together . " It was put up by Sen. Albert Gore 's opponent , and it lists the names of Sens . Edward Kennedy , George McGovern , J , William Fulbright and Gore . The first three names are roughly 4 inches high ; Gore 's name is in 8-inch letters . The remainder of the sign , which stands some 6 feet , says " Elect Bill Brock " in letters almost 2 feet high . - An advertisement that has appeared in several of the state 's daily newspapers shows a picture of Gore at the fund-raising party given for him by Democratic leaders in the Senate at Kennedy 's Virginia estate . Mr. Kennedy can be seen in the background . The ad was paid for by a group reportedly Republican in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is no accident that Gore , who is seeking re-election to his fourth term in the Senate , is being associated in campaign publicity with other Senate liberals . The Republican strategy is to label him a man " too liberal to represent Tennessee " any longer . His opponent in the August primary , the Governor 's press secretary who had never before run for public office , said so and collected some 238,767 votes , just about 30,900 less than the veteran Senator . His Republican opponent in the coming general election , Rep. William Brock , seemed to spend as much time campaigning against Gore in the Republican primary as he did against his own opponents . Since winning that election 4 to 1 , Brock has stepped up his attack against Gore 's " liberal " record , and to give Brock as much help as possible , Vice President Spiro Agnew came to Tennessee on September 23 and blasted Gore as one " who voices the tired and boring clich  --  s of defeated liberalism . " The Vice President also charged that Gore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for " radical liberals " by such men as Senator McGovern . He chided Gore for calling himself the " No. 1 Target " of the Nixon Administration and said : " There have been complaints that Bill Brock has invited his friends into Tennessee to address the people here . Well , let me say that Bill Brock is not ashamed of the President and the Vice President of the United States . They are his friends and he has welcomed them to his home state of Tennessee . But when the incumbent Senator comes home , you do not see him bringing down to Memphis his radical liberal friends he hobnobs with up in Manhattan and Georgetown , because these friends would not sit very well with the people of Tennessee . " On the liberal issue , Gore , of course , disagrees . He sees this election as a choice " between a progressive Democrat and a reactionary Republican . " He has said : " The real issue of the campaign is my record as contrasted with Rep. William Brock 's record . It is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people of Tennessee . Congressman Brock has continually voted against legislation which would be beneficial to Tennesseeans -- funds for education , for mental health research and rehabilitation , for community hospitals and nursing homes and for highway construction and beautification . " Congressman Brock 's charges against Gore seem to make sectionalism and even patriotism , as well as liberalism , major issues in this campaign . " Senator Gore has consistently turned his back on the people of Tennessee with his positions on the war , his opposition to Southern judges nominated for the Supreme Court , and his vote for gun control , " Brock declares at almost every campaign - stop . Although Gore has said he did not see " how patriotism could become an issue in the campaign , " he more recently acknowledged that some of Brock 's comments about his opposition to the war , were a challenge to his patriotism . For example , Brock told cheering party workers at Memphis : " I pledge that I will stand behind every boy we put in uniform , no matter where he is in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voted , as Gore did , for the Cooper-Church amendment " to tie the hands of the President in Southeast Asia . " Such statements have caused some persons to question Gore on his stand . In reply to one such question from a college student , he said he has opposed the policies that sent American soldiers into Vietnam , but that he has " voted 100 per cent for every measure to give them the/ money and material to do the job . " Gore is seeking to counteract all efforts to paint him as too liberal and perhaps insufficiently patriotic by stressing Brock 's voting record on issues of prinie interest to voters in Tennessee . He has recently distributed throughout the state reprints from the Congressional Record showing that on fifty issues " important to Tennessee , " Gore and a majority of Tennessee Congressmen of both parties voted Yes . And so did Gore 's fellow Senator , Republican Howard Baker , 90 per cent of the time . But Brock voted Nay . Gore brings this up at almost every political stop . He cites @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Congressman Brock vote ? He voted No , no , no , no , fifty times no . He 's Mr. No . No . " And when a Republican National Committee publication recently labeled Gore as the " big spender " of the week , the Senator sent an open letter to the President  --  and the press  --  saying : " This official publication has charged me with supporting anti-poverty programs , housing programs , programs to improve education , and veterans ' benefits and Appalachia , all of which President Nixon has vetoed . To this I plead guilty . " How does all this campaign rhetoric register with voters in Tennessee ? A sampling of voters across the state , brings such comments as these : " I think Brock 's main sin is one of omission rather than commission . In reference to voting records , Gore has Brock beat so bad it 's pitiful . I do n't give a damn about the Southern judges Gore voted against either  --  let 's face it , even Carswell 's own state did n't want him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ candidate is in favor of Nixon or against him . " The speaker , a middle-aged lawyer , added emphatically that he was for Nixon and so was Brock ; so Brock will get his vote . A few blocks away , a woman voter was asked what she thinks about the candidates : " I think it is about time people realized that everybody should get a fair shake from their government . . ? not just rich whites and campaign workers . I 'm for Gore . I think Brock is just trying to make himself look good in Nixon 's eyes . " Brock has characterized Gore as remote from the people of the state and , by implication at least , connected with social unrest domestically because of his opposition to the war . Apparently this got through to an officer in the Shelby County ( Memphis ) sheriff 's office . " I do n't like Brock , " he said . " But I think he 's the lesser of two evils . I have a kid at Memphis State University who has grown hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sign the other day when I told him to get it cut . He keeps telling me how great Gore is , , and if that 's what Gore is for , then I 'm not . " A telephone ' operator swore and ' then said that " if it was n't for Gore 's stupidity , and liberal attitude for so long , I do n't think there would be so many college riots in Tennessee . He just keeps egging it on . " ( During the 1969-70 school year the state was relatively free of major campus disruptions. ) ci On several major campuses young Gore partisans are urging radicals to " cool it " until after the election . And the Senator obviously had that in mind when he issued a special plea for calm and politeness when Gen. William Westmoreland visited Knoxville early in October to attend the Army-University of Tennessee football game . An off-campus newspaper produced by persons active in various protests also urged students not to ' picket or otherwise oppose Westmoreland 's presence . The General 's visit went off without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trounced . But early in October a rumor began circulating that Mr. Nixon will be in Knoxville for the Tennessee-Florida game on October 24 , and will have Congressman Brock at his side . When the President visited the Billy Graham crusade here in May , he was picketed and booed , and a number of students and several faculty members were arrested . Gore 's people fear that a second visit from Nixon could touch off still larger campus disorders , to the disadvantage of their candidate . A cafeteria manager referred to Brock as an " apple-pie flag waver , " along with a few other phrases . He said he thought Gore should be given a chance to finish the job ' he started . But a dock worker said he thought it was " going too far " when Gore " voted against Nixon just for the hell of it . I did n't mind too much when he voted against Haynsworth , but when he voted against Carswell too , it began to show him for what he is . " And another man said he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this with Gore and said : " I voted for Gore once , but I think he 's outlived his usefulness , beginning about midway through the last term . " While Gore was a heavy favorite among Negro voters in the primary , feelings about him in the black community are mixed . For example , one Negro woman told an interviewer , " I 'm for Gore , because maybe he 'll help get us out of Vietnam , and I think he 's better for the black people . " But a much younger black man , an insurance adjuster , said : " I 'm for Brock , I think Brock is in favor of our business more than Gore . Not only that , but I have a son in ' Vietnam , who is proud of his country and glad to fight for it . I ca n't see how Gore can consider pulling everybody out after everything that 's already happened over there . " Negro leaders are reportedly planning to invite the Rev. Ralph David Abernathy of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Political observers feel that Gore would on the whole benefit from any such move . However , there is some feeling that too great a display of black support might alienate a segment of the voters . Brock 's repeated charge that Gore is out of touch with the people of Tennessee was endorsed by a well-educated woman in Oak Ridge , home of the Atomic Energy Commission 's National Laboratory . She complained that as a member of the Joint Congressional Committee on Atomic Energy , the Senator had not fought hard enough . " He just did n't do his homework , " she said . " But I am going to vote for him again because I think Tennessee needs a representative on that committee . " Speaking recently in Oak Ridge , Gore reminded his audience of the position 4 he holds on the committee and told them , " I 'm in a good position to help the atomic energy programs for Oak Ridge . " Like many major candidates , Gore recently wrote a book outlining his years of service and his political philosophy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the book , Eye of the Storm , they chose to 4 emphasize that Gore wrote in favor of full diplomatic , cultural and trade relations with Red China . Communism is a major worry of many voters in the state , and the timing of the book 's release was perhaps a bit unfortunate , because during this campaign , the Senator has tended to ik play down his interest in international affairs . From the beginning of the primary , Gore was rated ' a sure loser . Many local and most national political writers wrote him off , sensing , perhaps , a surge of conservatism across the nation . However , some political observers are now reading the signs differently . Several national political writers see Gore gaining on Brock , and reports that the distinguished , gray-haired Senator is being given 10-to-8 odds by bookies in the central part of the state encourage many of his followers . They are also cheered by word that in some of the south-central counties betting men are calling it an even race . There are rumors that informal polls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tennessee by five td three , so if everyone voted a straights party ticket Gore would have no problem . But there is a third candidate in the race , Dr. Cecil Pitard of Knoxville , the American Party nominee , and no one forgets , the last poor third . Presidential election when the Democratic candidate ran a t Dr. Pitard has been overshadowed by both Gore and Brock , and feW expect him to make much of a showing . But there is still the question of where all those voters who cast their lot with George Wallace in 1968 will jump this time . Wallace finished a strong second to Nixon . Both major candidates acknowledge that the voters who went r for Wallace two years ago " could have an important bearing on the outcome . " As a rule they are not folk who cotton to so-called liberals ; often they are sectional in outlook ; and they vigorously support the President 's war efforts . So if Brock , can make liberalism , sectionalism and patriotism stick as major issues , his chance of Overcoming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enhanced . Both candidates are using television commercials produced by professional image makers . Brock tried at first to capitalize on the fact that Gore had hired an " outsider " to shore up his image at home ; but it was then revealed that Brock had his own " outside " image maker , and he dropped the issue . In both cases , some observers question the cunning of the image makers . One commercial , for example , shows Gore on a white horse ; many Gore supporters thought it a bit too much . And a Brock commercial shows him out hunting with a group of friends . It caused one loyal Republican to lament : " There goes ' the votes of the lovers of wildlife . " Gore is said to have spent only $90,000 on television so far ; Brock is thought to have invested around $300,000 . Gore 's campaign headquarters claims it does n't have much more money to spend . Brock , at 39 , has been in the House eight years , but his political prestige in Tennessee still can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years in the House before being elected to the Senate . So Brock relies heavily on his publicized closeness to President Nixon , a highly organized campaign operation , and heavy television expenditures to overcome the discrepancy . The 62-year-old Gore is a prodigious campaigner . He has covered hundreds of towns and crossroad hamlets in the state . On a person-to-person basis , he comes across exceedingly well . As one veteran Republican Party worker in east Tennessee said : " I do n't hear much talk about this liberalism and patriotism bit among my friends , so do n't count Albert Gore out . He 's running scared , but he does n't need to . He has shaken more hands across this state than any ten politicians I know . That counts with Tennessee voters . " And then talking like a man whose own candidate had lost to Brock in the primary , he added a bit wistfully : " But if we had a stronger candidate  --  well , it might be a different story .
