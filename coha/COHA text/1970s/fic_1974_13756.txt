The Stage is aclutter . It is the **30;1669;TOOLONG area of a low-income housing development . The furniture is cheap and garish . A cot is behind the sofa , a homemade comforter thrown over it . A broken motorcycle is in one corner , a new bicycle is in another . The walls are covered in dime-store paintings . A home entertainment center covers one wall . Kitchen cabinets are so full of junk , they stand open . The top of a washing machine serves as an eating place while an ornate dining table , garnished with fake flowers , sits decoratively untouched . There is a front door , of course , and a door to the hallway , bath and bedroom . There is also a glass door to a terrace on which there is a clothesline , a St. Bernard dog ( unseen ) and a nauseating view of downtown Jersey City . The WIFE enters , her arms full of grocery bags . She puts them in the sink . She is fat , fifty and was obviously once beautiful  --  at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life stopped .
