txt At a time when gasoline prices are skyrocketing , many US motorists may be paying an illegal surcharge : price gouging . So says the Consumer Federation of America ( CFA ) , which represents some 240 nongovernmental , grass-roots consumer groups around the country . But this " big problem , " to use the words of CFA energy specialist Michael Podhorzer , is being fought on an increasing number of federal and local fronts : ? The Department of Energy 's Economic Regulatory Administration ( ERA ) has set up an emergency hot line to receive complaints of alleged gasoline gouging . Some 2,500 complaints were received from Feb. 15 to March 30 , with the number of complaints increasing all the time , says ERA spokesman Peggy Dalrymple . Alleged price gougers are being sent so-called NOPVs ( notices of probable violations ) . *Please turn to Page 7 From page : 1 Plugging the price leak at gas pump - ? Many local government consumer watchdog agencies , including the Boston Energy Office and the New York City Consumer Affairs Department , have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Says Karen Borak of the Consumer Affairs Department here : " The enforcement of federal gasoline price reguations is almost up to the gasoline dealers themselves " because of a lack of federal enforcement ? and thus there is price gouging . ? The President 's Office of Consumer Affairs , run by special assistant for consumer affairs Esther Peterson , will soon send a strong letter to David Bardin , head of the Economic Regulatory Administration , urging the agency to enforce its regulations , " says Fred Goldberg , a spokesman for the Office of Consumer Affairs . " You will have more vigilance on this issue of gas price gouging from grass-roots consumer groups and the national groups will probably push for more enforcement of regulations , " Mr. Goldberg said . Under the federal Emergency Petroleum Allocation Act , which Congress passed on Nov. 27 , 1973 , Gasoline retailers have to follow a complicated formula setting legal limits on the retail price of gasoline . The regulations established under the act work this way : On top of the wholesale price of gasoline , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of profit he was making before Nov. 27 , 1973 , plus 3 cents , plus the rent increases for the station . So hypothetically , if the wholesale price of gasoline was 30 cents back then , and has since doubled , and if the margin of profit was 10 cents a gallon then , the maximum allowable price today would be 73 cents ( this does not include rent increases ) . Bob Cecil , a spokesman for the Economic Regulatory Administration of the Department of Energy , said that 10,321 letters had gone out to retailei*s in 48 states urging compliance with regulations . But he said that , as of this moment , no fines had been levied . Fines of up to $10,000 a day are possible for " willful violations . " He stressed , however , that " obviously we ca n't investigate all 170,000 gasoline stations around the country . " That is where local consumer groups come in , says Mr. Podhorzer of the Consumer Federation of America . lie suggests that local groups begin publishing the names of stations with exorbitant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stations . Some oil industry spokesmen say the complicated price ceiling regulations help foster overcharges.
