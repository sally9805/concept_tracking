txt Apollo 15 astronauts John Young and Charles Duke are scheduled to make man 's fifth landing on the moon tomorrow . While astronaut Thomas Ken Mattingly remains in lunar orbit , Young and Duke will land in the Descartes area of the moon , where the highlands tower 16,000 feet . Once there , they will use their lunar rover to cover 18 miles in three trips of seven hours each . 12 Miles from Surface The astronauts set the stage for ** landing by going into an initial orbit around the moon this afternoon . Early tonight they changed that orbit to bring them to within 12 miles of the moon 's surface . It is from this distance that Young and Duke will start their descent to the surface . Twice during the spaceship 's fourth orbit of the moon , a mysterious drop in electrical voltages triggered the craft 's shrill master caution and yarning alarm . However , there was no immediate indication of trouble that might interfere with the lunar landing series . The three astronauts went to bed on schedule at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As they came out from behind the moon after firing their rocket engine to go into orbit , Duke commented , " It feels like we 're clipping the tops of the trees . " A jubilant Young later reported , " Hello , Houston , Sweet 16 has arrived . A super doublefantastic burn . " Calls It " Greatest " Then he added that " three guys have each got a window and we 're staring at the ground . That has got to be the greatest way to make a living anybody has ever invented . " Duke , looking at a peak in the middle of a crater said , " It looks like a piece of marshmallow floating in a cup of hot chocolate . " Shortly after the astronauts went into orbit , the third stage of their Saturn 5 rocket crashed into the lunar surface whir the impact of 11 tons of TNT . The shock waves were measured by seismometers left on the moon by earlier Apollo astronauts . The seismographs will be studied by scientists here for more clues to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to touch down on the surface in the Descartes area tomorrow afternoon to begin man 's first exploration of a lunar highlands . The area in which they will land is an estimated 16,000 feet in altitude . Young and Duke will use their lunar rover vehicle to drive over 18 miles in three exploratory trips lasting seven hours each . The astronauts went into lunar orbit at 2:32 p. m . Chicago time after a six-minute rocket firing . This cut their speed from 3 , - 305 to 1,296 miles an hour and allowed the gravitational pull of the moon to hold the space . craft . The engine was fired while the astronauts were behind the moon and out of contact with the earth . Ground controlers had to wait 22 minutes for the astronauts to come out from behind the moon before learning the maneuver was successful . As they were approaching the moon earlier in the afternoon , Mattingly , who will remain in lunar orbit in the mother ship while Young and Duke are on the surface , looked out the window of the spacecraft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moon .
