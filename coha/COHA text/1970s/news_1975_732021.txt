txt Letters to the Editor pg . 24 Letters to the Editor City Prisons : The Backward Steps To the Editor : The announcement by the Department of Correction that the Bronx House of Detention for Men will be closed , with its inmate population to be transferred to Rikers Island or to the Ossining facility , is further evidence of the regressive trend in the city 's correctional administration . The recent closings of three borough houses of detention indicate the official pursuit of an " out-of-sight , out-ofmind " policy by the department , a retreat from the city 's commitment to correctional reform following the major prison rebellions in 1970 . The past year has witnessed the shift of large numbers of detained persons to Rikers Island . The result has been the quiet establishment of a veritable prisoners ' colony on Rikers , many of whose institutions , especially the House of Detention for Men , are in appalling condition . Institutional overcrowding , structural decay , incidents of prison violence , a lack of significant programs for detainees and the reduction of opportunities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public to tour the facility characterize it . In contrast , the Bronx House of Detention is , in the department 's own words , " in excellent condition . " Most importantly , it is accessible to inmates ' families and to the community at large . The location and visiting procedures of Rikers Island facilities reduce the opportunities for inmates awaiting trial ( and therefore innocent citizens under the law ) to receive desperately needed contact with persons in their communities . Obviously , the transfer of inmates to Ossining virtually eliminates such opportunities . A disturbing aspect of this major change in the city 's correctional policy is that it is being accomplished without public scrutiny . Several years ago , the Board of Correction , an independent watchdog , proclaimed as a major goal the involvement by the community at large in New York 's prisons . It was hoped that a public aware of and concerned about prison conditions would not tolerate the recurrence of factors that contributed to the violence of 1970 . The over-all thrust of the board 's advocacy was toward the development @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ virtually everything that Rikers Island represents . The city 's budget crisis should not be allowed to compel the abandonment of the lessons of prison reform that the violence of 1970 should have taught us . WILLIAM J. ARNONE New York , June 23 , 1975 City Hall vs. the Majority To the Editor : When the Board of Estimate and the City Council consider the proposed new taxes , they would do well to keep in mind the interests of those of us who are not on the city payroll . We are the great majority of the population . Zero unemployment and regular wage increases in the civil service are not our main concern these difficult days , yet our top public officials appear to think their responsibility is first of all to preserve the good life of their own employes . The wage freeze urged by The Times editorial June 28 must be negotiated . One notes that the tax increases agreed upon in Albany about equal the wage increases called for in present union contracts , a quid pro quo of zero appeal to the taxpayers our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . New York , July 7. 1975 ? What to Do With Garbage To the Editor : What New Yorkers can do in the next sanitation crisis : ? Put out for collection only perishable garbage  --  table scraps , potato peelings , the smelly paper the fish came in . ? For a reasonable time , let the rest accumulate , neatly , inside  --  newspapers and magazines in piles in a closet ; clean waste paper in one carton , washed bottles and cans in another in the kitchen . ? As a permanent solution , recycle . All those wrappings that we pay for and then pay to have carted away , those piles of expensive newsprint , In Support of a Veto To the Editor : In a June 12 editorial you attacked President Ford for vetoing the Surface Mining Coal Bill and me for voting to sustain his veto in the House of Representatives . Although you singled me out by name , it is only fair to point out that 57 Democrats and 86 Republicans joined me in that vote backing the President . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concluded by characterizing the President and me as " captives " of the cal mining industry . I do not know , nor have I ever met , a coal mine operator , nor do I have any reason to favor or fear one . I do represent people in Nassau County , who want me to help reduce unemployment , keep down electric rates and reduce our nation 's dependence on Arab oil . In his veto message , the President stated that the Surface Mining bill , as written , would have cost the nation as many as 36,000 jobs ; that under its provisions consumers would pay even higher electric bills and that the nation would lose substantial coal production and become more dependent on foreign oil . I have to take such statements by the President seriously . glass and aluminum ? if they could be salvaged , paying the sanitation men would be no problem . The problem is in the " if , " starting with : If we will take the trouble . DONALD W. MARSHALL Bedford Hills , N. Y. , July 3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should like to make my periodic observation that the current " recession " is largely imaginary . The loaded shopping carts in all the supermarkets and the crowded luxury tours to points all over the world bear witness to our continued prosperity . Our unemployment rate is slightly higher than two or three years ago , but well within the range of the past fifty years . To be sure , prices are high , but so are wages . This is not due to any conspiracy on the part of producers . or labor ? it is simply that our paper money has no Government backing . Inflation will continue just as long as the Government refuses to redeem its paper with gold or silver coin as provided by the Constitution ( Article I , Section 10 ) . A carpenter who receives the normal union wage can buy his daily food ( for one person ) in return for only nine minutes ' labor . In 1950 it required nineteen minutes , in 1960 fourteen minutes , in 1970 ten minutes to earn three meals . The real sufferers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insurance income , pensioners and people who live on their lifetime savings . ROBERT W. BUCK , M.D. Waban , Mass. , July 4 , 1975 The issue on the veto was whether he was right . Congressional hearings were held to challenge the President 's statement . I have carefully read the testimony , and while the exact number of jobs to be lost or the precise amount of cost increases or lost production were questioned , it clearly appeared that the economy and employment would suffer . My vote , accordingly , was in the best interest of the people of the Fifth Congressional District . I still want a surface-mining bill enacted . Any such bill must take account of current economic conditions and employment problems . The states directly involved can do the job of regulating surface mining within their borders . They have such power and , of course , the most at stake . Any Federal law should encourage them to protect their own lands , without a Federal takeover of enforcement . We can have a good surface-mining bill along the lines President Ford @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that will protect not only the environment but the economy as well . JOHN W. WYDLER U.S. Representative , 5th Dist. , N.Y . Washington , June 23 , 1975 Of Illness and Freedom To the Editor : The New York Civil Liberties Union may be right in asserting that the Supreme Court 's unanimous decision in the Donaldson case would establish a new right to freedom for thousands of institutionalized mental patients . This writer , however , has some serious reservations as to the extent and nature of the freedom these discharged patients would enjoy . The Court ruled that harmless mental patients may not be involuntarily detained without treatment if they are capable of surviving outside an institution . If not dangerous and presumably capable of " hacking it " on the outside , how did . such individuals come to be involuntarily confined in the first instance ? The Supreme Court 's decision , however , bypassed the crucial issue as to what real " freedom " awaits patients who have been discharged into the " community " without adequate preparation , and with no available community @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are struggling to adjust to a new and often hostile environment . The problem is not simply how to depopulate the custodial institutions of persons who should not have been involuntarily committed or retained in the first place , nor even that of solely " humanizing " the present institutional system for those appropriately retained . Civil libertarians are properly concerned with constitutional questions of involuntary commitment or retention and of assuring to institutionalized , individuals decent standards of treatment . The real issues involved go deeper than the protection of individuals from arbitrary restraint . A civilized state has an affirmative obligation to provide for its handicapped , vulnerable or dysfunctional members . - and the mentally ill are only a segment of such populations ? the preventive , treatment and rehabilitative services enabling them to live and contribute to societal life according to their capacities and limitations . It is only when such services are made available in a normalizing and community-based milieu that one can truly talk of freedom .

IRVING BLUMBERG Executive Vice President Intl . Comm , Against Mental Illness New York , July 3 , 1975 ? The Women of Israel To the Editor : I am appalled by the International Women 's Year World Conference declaration in Mexico City condemning Zionism . Through the many study I have organized and directed in Israel , I and my colleagues have had untold opportunities to witness the fact that Israel has been and is a champion of women 's right to work and is a leader in equal rights for women . We visited the many institutions in Israel where Israeli women serve Arabs , Druze and Bedouins , and Christian and Moslem as well as Jewish men , women and children . In the " Arab-Mother-Child . Care " centers , Israeli women volunteers teach the essentials of child care . In the Negev , Dr. Viola Torak serves peoples of all backgrounds : 120,000 Jews and 20,0(X) Bedouins . ?

Editorial June 6 . ( Sister ) ROSE THERING Seton Hall University South Orange , N. J. , July 5 , 1975 ? He Loves a Parade To the Editor : Your June 24 editorial " The High Cost of Marching " suggests that the cost of parades is too high for ' New York City . Of course , there is a high cost to everything nowadays . The question is whether the high cost is worth the music , fun , pride and spectacle provided for all the family by such affairs , especially to lower-income families , who can not afford weekends in Southampton or ' the more sophisticated entertainments of our theaters and concert halls . Like millions of other New Yorkers , I love a parade  --  the bigger , the livelier , the noisier , the better . Nowhere . else can anyone see and enjoy so much at so little cost to us all as at our great ethnic parades ( the cause of your editorial ) , whose color and spirit do so much to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practical " city . More often we should strike up the marching bands and clear from our great Fifth Avenue the gas-spewing , horn-blowing vehicles ; and bring on the costumed beautiful girls , the bright , waving flags and banners and the eyedazzling floats and cultural displays . New York City can ill afford the high cost of not having such pageants , even if they do cause " overtime " for some sanitation workers and a " nuisance " to some Fifth Avenue dog walkers , " impede " the movement of scam people in  --  a hurry and " leave " some areas in our richest . city in the world without ' ' proper police protection " ( the latter . an inexcusable shortcoming , is always present and in no way can be placed on " marching " ) . I think it would be well for The Times to give a more serious cost . benefit analysis to this important subject . BERTIL SWANTESON New York , June 25 , 1975               @ @ @ @ @ @
