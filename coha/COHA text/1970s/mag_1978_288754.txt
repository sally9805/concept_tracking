MADAME ROSA Directed and Written by Moshe Mizrahi <P> She slumps up the tenement stairs , leaking sighs , an old , sick , fat woman with an elastic bandage on one leg . Can this really be Simone Signoret , the stunning actress who won a 1959 Oscar for her role as Laurence Harvey 's lover in Room at the Topi ? Yes . Time is a carrion-eating bird , and this is what appears left of Signoret , 57 , unrecognizable except for those cat 's eyes . She is cast all too convincingly as a broken-down ex-hooker who squeezes out a living in a seedy quarter of Paris by being a foster grandmother for prostitutes ' children . Blink twice , and Brooke Shields will be playing the part . <P> Madame Rosa won an Oscar last week as the best foreign film of 1977 , but the honor seems slightly askew . Director Moshe Mizrahi 's film is so unashamedly a vehicle for a grand old actress that the award might better have been made by Motor Trend magazine . Signoret is marvelous as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Momo , the 14-year-old Arab boy who sticks with Madame Rosa to the end . Claude Dauphin is gallant as the indomitable old doctor who tends Rosa , and who is himself so rickety that he must be carried up to her room when he makes his house calls . <P> The trouble is that Director Mizrahi , an Israeli whose credits include The House on Chelouche Street , has not found a way to turn this fine acting into a movie . Watching Madame Rosa is like spending an interesting couple of hours at an actors ' workshop on an afternoon when everyone is noodling with death scenes . One reason the film lacks conviction is that the script is loaded with melodrama . Rosa is not simply a dear old party , she is made to be a survivor of Auschwitz , an agnos tic Jew who clings to the ceremonies of her religion in a basement shrine . Momo is not just an abandoned child ; he is the son ( as one of the film 's stagier scenes reveals ) of a psychotic pimp who murdered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only get a little help from their friends , they are supported by a black transsexual whore who displays the customary heart of gold . <P> This flabbiness spoils a considerable effort to look clearly at the defeats of old age . A courageous old boarder in Rosa 's house simply collapses and dies . Rosa knows that her mind is slipping into senility . The boy Momo , caught in the erratic currents of adolescence , tries to puzzle out these shabby indignities . When the film sees life through his eyes , its strengths begin to cohere . There is no discredit to Signoret in speculating that Madame Rosa would have made better artistic sense if it had been called Momo , and if it had given most of its attention to the life that was beginning , not the one that had all but ended . <P> - John Skow
