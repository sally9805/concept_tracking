When the alarm clock went off at half past four I was awake and waiting for it , wishing for it , the nightlong , fitful southwest wind having made my sleep fitful  --  that , plus my anticipation , mixed with some misgiving , over the coming day . The place was Nantucket , the month September , the day the last one of my two weeks ' stay on the island . // Disgruntled with freshwater fishing , with drought and pollution and crowds on the streams , I had heeded the advice given me by a famous fisherman , now dead , and had turned to the ocean , expecting to find it teeming with trophies and to have , if not all of it to myself , at least a sizable private portion of it . During my time on Nantucket I had seen more fishermen than fish . The striped bass and the bluefish had shunned its accessible shores . In the tackle shops , fishermen reported daily on conditions at Surfside , Smith Point , Tom Nevers Head , and the story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daylight or dark , using this bait or that lure  --  nothing . // Such conversations , however , often ended on a note intriguing to a newcomer like me . " Catching them out at Great Point , " one man would observe with a sigh . To which another man would give a snort and say , " Oh , sure ! There ! " After that , there was nothing more to be said , it seemed . I ventured a time or two to wonder aloud , why not try at Great Point , then , if that was where the fish were ? What I got by way of reply was the dampening look of an old salt for a rank apprentice , of an islander for an off-islander. // Now surfcasters are men of stamina , rugged and adventurous , ready for anything . Theirs is not a gentle and contemplative recreation . They rise in darkness , drive distances , fish in the worst weather . Of all the many subspecies of fishermen , they take the greatest risks ; in fact , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , breasting the breakers , invading the surf , seeking to extend their casts a few feet to reach schools of feeding fish , are swept to sea and lost each year , leaving widows and orphans to mourn them . What was there about Great Point that deterred these oldtime surfmen whose scuttlebutt I overheard at Bill Fisher 's Tackle Shop ? And who were those fools who rushed in where others feared to tread , the ones who were out there catching the fish ? // These questions were to be answered today . I had been joined on the island by my friend , the dauntless Al Clements , a man whom nothing can discourage or deflect , or even distract , wherever there is water with possible sport in it , who groans at the thought of fishes being changed into loaves . Al would stop at nothing . Knowing this was the cause of my misgiving , and my anticipation . He had arrived in his four-wheel-drive Scout  --  the indispensable conveyance for the trip to Great Point . Now as I dressed in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I felt a bit like Melville 's Ishmael , accosted on another Nantucket morning by Elijah , crazed survivor of a voyage aboard the Pequod with that maniacal fisherman Captain Ahab : " Shipmates , have ye shipped in that ship ? Anything down there about your souls ? " // Today 's Nantucket fishing fleet is not made up of square-rigged whalers with longboats on davits ready for lowering at the cry of " Thar she blows ! " It is an even more numerous fleet of four-wheel-drive vehicles bristling with surf rods the length of harpoons , ready-rigged for the signal that sweeps over the island with the wind  --  " Bluefish in ! " You see them coming off the ferryboats from Hyannis , bouncing over the cobblestones of Main Street , parked outside the A &amp; P , rods riding flat in racks on the roof or else upright , like lances , in a row of sockets bolted to the front bumper so that the riders look through them as through bars . In the darkness of early morning and early evening , from May to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the beaches . For although the books tell you that bluefish are mainly daytime feeders , the ones that vacation around Nantucket have not read the books . They are as independent and set in their ways as the islanders themselves ; they dine at dusk , they breakfast by the light of the moon . // It was dark but moonless when we set off that morning from Madaket , on the west side of the island , with Al , pipe in mouth , at the wheel . The treeless , featureless , flat landscape might have been the sea and we in the cabin of a boat . We were to traverse the length of the island . A strong starboard wind opposed us as we tacked toward Nantucket town . Sanguine as always , Al said , " Today , Bill , we 're going to kill them . " Doubtful as always , I grunted . // Our course took us around the town and out east toward Siasconset . We veered from that route shortly to go northwest toward Polpis . Long , narrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At the coastal settlement of Wauwinet , the paved road ended . It seemed that the world ended there . We stopped and got out and , by flashlight , in a hurricane wind , deflated our tires . For not even a four-wheel-drive vehicle , even in low , low gear , can get through deep sand with its tires inflated . We reduced the pressure to 10 pounds , making certain by the gauge that it was the same in all four tires . The least imbalance  --  as little as a pound 's difference  --  can cause one wheel to dig into the sand and spin uselessly . You do not want to be stuck on a narrow beach with the tide rising or a line storm coming on . A fisherman-conscious community has provided an air compressor and hose at that jumping-off place for the use of those returning from the Point and resuming travel on the paved road  --  a reassuring thought , one that I , buffeted by the wind and blinded by the darkness , grasped at uncertainly but eagerly . // There we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon Great Point , a narrow spit of sand extending five miles into Nantucket Sound . Instantly we learned why all but the most determined  --  some might say , the most demented  --  fishermen avoid Great Point . It was as though we had launched a small craft upon a stormy sea and in a raging gale . // On either side of the land , which rose barely above water level , the ocean heaved and swelled . The spit seemed to undulate upon it . Running more or less down the middle of this ribbon of sand was a road of sorts  --  a track about as permanent as the wake of a boat . Ruts made in it by previous vehicles lasted little longer than a trail in water , buried within minutes in drifts , dunes , waves of sand . You had to cut your own path through them . No caution could be observed , for to pause was to sink , so we went at breakneck speed  --  I know of no stretch of road anywhere that restores that tired expression to more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we pitched , we tossed , we yawed , almost plunging into the water on one side and the next moment into that on the other side . We rolled , we crested , we bottomed . We were jolted in all directions , now against the roof and now against the doors and now against the dashboard and now against each other . His pipe removed from his mouth for safety , Al clung to the wheel . I clung , when I could , to my door handle . // The five-mile trip took 20 minutes ; it seemed longer . After about the first mile of it I began to laugh . I was laughing at my own madness in going to such lengths in pursuit of fish . After that , I laughed because I did n't know what else to do . Then I laughed to keep myself from crying . Finally , I laughed because I was enjoying myself . So was my friend . There comes a time in life when , because you are on an adventure , even an uncomfortable one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ routine , whatever it may be , and there is no knowing how many more chances life will bring you to do something madcap . Living over just such experiences as you try to fall asleep at the end of yet another day , you are reassured that you have lived . // It was just over a year earlier , shortly before his death , that the world-renowned fisherman Charles Ritz had said to me , " Our kind of fishing , yours and mine , fly-fishing for trout and salmon , is coming to an end . The habitat of these fastidious fish has been tampered with too much . Their range has shrunk steadily and , despite the efforts of a few concerned people , will continue to shrink . The future of sport fishing is in the ocean . Only it  --  up to now  --  has been big and mighty enough to withstand man 's mistreatment of it . " His prediction was being realized faster than he had foreseen , if my experience the past couple of seasons was indicative . So , late in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ocean . // To get here I had come a long way  --  not in distance so much as in attitude , orientation  --  and I had arrived as ignorant as an immigrant . Born and brought up on the prairies , I had remained a landlubber . Oh , I had crossed the Atlantic more times than I could remember , both by boat and by plane , but once safely on either of its shores I had headed inland instinctively . No beachcomber , I. That was not my element . So much water seemed too much for me . Now , a latecomer to the ocean , I felt as though I were the first , as though I had discovered it . From this desolate outpost , in the nacreous light just breaking , it looked as though the ocean were being seen for the first time , just emerging from the primal void . // A fierce wind was blowing  --  just how fierce we would learn when , battered and bruised from our wild ride , we stepped out into it . From off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a veritable sandstorm , making the waves look like windswept desert dunes . Arrested upon the wind , hundreds of gulls and terns hung low over the water , screaming incessantly . The waters off the Point  --  treacherous waters where many a shipwreck lies  --  matched the wind in their convulsions . Heaving and seething , hissing loudly , the waves dashed against the spit , each lapping higher than the last on the rising tide , each undertow capturing and carrying back with it more of the shrinking shoreline . They seemed at war among themselves , wave rearing and crashing against wave , roller chasing roller . // I was , of course , far from the first ever to see it . From this very island , so changed since his time , Herman Melville once looked to sea , and it appeared the same to him as it does now to us  --  about the only thing that does . Arresting thought ! We have polluted it , depleted it , we have all but exterminated the leviathans Melville fished for in it , yet it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it be said that we see it now as it has always been seen . The ocean withstands our imposition . In its ceaseless motion lies its permanence . // No wonder we invest it with prodigies , with sea serpents and monsters , for not even its real and observable wonders , its whales and its great sharks , its giant squid and octopuses , seem commensurate with its vastness , the mysteries of its depths , its tremendous pressures , its titanic moods . No wonder we fancy it to contain a Bermuda Triangle into which all who venture disappear , with a lost Atlantis , with legends such as that of the Flying Dutchman doomed to wander eternally over its wastes . The imagination is unmoored by it and drifts without landmarks on its limitless expanses , over its fathomless profundities. // Was it hereabouts , on Nantucket , perhaps , that Melville first had his thought : Meditation and water are wedded forever ? // At first the doors of the Scout could not be opened . They were unlocked , yet they could not be opened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , wrenched it half off its hinges , slammed it against the front fender and sprung it so it could not be closed again until after a visit to a body shop . // Outside , you could not see your feet ; they were lost in the driven sand . It seemed that the entire spit was being blown away ; we wondered whether by the time we were ready to leave we would be able to get back overland . There was no looking into the wind  --  no facing it , even . Wherever you were exposed to it , your skin smarted and stung , even the palms of your hands . It was a moving wall . It doubled you over , knocked out your breath , rocked you on your heels . It threatened momentarily to blow just a puff harder and pick you up and hurl you out to sea . The sand filling it was coarse , all finer stuff having long since been winnowed out ; rated as shotgun pellets , it would have been about No. 9 , the size for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , removed house paint , scoured brick buildings , engraved  --  or effaced  --  tombstones . Luckily for us the wind was at our backs as we faced the water ; otherwise we could not have fished . Had we had to cast into the wind , it would have flung our big , heavy lures , treble hooks and all , right back at us. // The sea surface erupted regularly in a fine spray as though a shotgun had gone off underwater . Then birds dropped to the water as though shot . They rose again with baitfish wriggling in their bills . An instant later the same spot erupted again , this time with heavier ammunition . Out of the water and into the air leaped fish a yard long , missile-shaped , metal-colored , glistening : bluefish of 12 to 15 pounds . It was these that had driven the baitfish inshore and made them leap out of the water in terror and desperation . The baitfish drew the gulls and the terns . Now these were drawing other fishermen besides us. // Here was one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One of the principal charms of trout fishing , at least for me , is the solitude ; one of my disappointments in it recently had been the growing crowds on my favorite streams . Now , expecting to find myself alone somewhere on the long Atlantic coast , I found myself on one of its most inaccessible points fishing in a crowd , at times even tangling lines with my neighbor on one side or the other , and finding this a key element of the excitement . Just seeing so many fish caught was exhilarating . There were times when every man on the beach was tugging at a rod bent nearly double . To be one among them elevated the blood pressure  --  not to be one among them did , too . Then you cast even faster , even farther . // There was , I was learning , a pattern , a rhythm to waves  --  a different one each day , even at different hours of the same day , and even on adjacent stretches of the same beach . I was learning , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to it , else you may feed the fish instead of their feeding you . Even then you must be alert , for the sea is capricious and can slip in a breaker out of step . Already in my brief experience I had had unlooked-for waves take the sand from under my feet , drop me in a hole , sweep me up and draw me in. // That morning off Great Point it was twin breakers succeeded by the undertow . In tandem they slammed the shore , then withdrew deeply to gather themselves for another assault . By waiting out the breakers , then sprinting after the tow , I could lengthen my cast by a good 30 feet . Then , while my plug was still traveling through the air , I scurried up the strand , sandpiper-quick , to escape the incoming breaker , meanwhile leaving open the bail of my reel and letting out line . In effect , I was casting my lure in one direction and myself in the other . I had to propel myself backward , for the wind was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steadiness with which it blew that the sand was driven into everything . It grated in the gears of reels designed to keep it out . It spoiled a can of beer before I could down it . It had later to be shoveled from the Scout . I was to find on returning home after four hours ' exposure to it that my pants pockets contained enough sand to fill a large hourglass . My hair and scalp could have furnished enough for several egg timers . Five showers later , I would still be picking grains from my ears . // I would backpedal up the strand and retrieve my lure . That may sound like a leisurely enough exercise to someone whose fishing has been confined to freshwater ponds . In surfcasting for bluefish , using a big , long , heavy rod , a big reel , and big , heavy plugs , you retrieve as fast as you possibly can . Seeing it done for the first time , you will think those maniacs on the beach reeling so frantically away are not trying to catch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are doing what you must do . When baitfish find themselves in the vicinity of bluefish they flee fast ; your imitation baitfish has got to do the same . So you reel until you pant , until your hand is stiff , your arm trembling with the strain . And as soon as you have recovered your lure you hurl it back out as fast as you can get rid of it . As in all fishing , you will catch nothing with your bait out of water , but in fishing for bluefish you can not rest for a minute . For , just as capriciously as they appear offshore , they are gone again . You fish for them while they are there , before they consume all the baitfish and depart . That does not take them long , for they are a gluttonous fish , equipped with a mouthful of teeth that could shred a truck tire . They will redden the surf with the blood of their prey . When they have gorged themselves , they vomit and start all over again . Although it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Great Point after that ride to get there , you are too absorbed to notice . // You crank as fast as you can , and with today 's fast-ratio spinning reels , each turn of the handle recovers nearly a yard of line : that will give you an idea of the speed of your lure on top of the water . The first time it is stopped dead as though hooked to a pier , you will have an idea of the speed of a big bluefish frenziedly on the feed . Casting a minute dry fly to a finicky , mistrustful , one-pound trout is no preparation for it . No caution in bluefish . They are greedy , undiscriminating and seem never to have been warned against fishermen . My first one that day nearly yanked the rod from my hands . // The fish and I were both stunned and disbelieving to find ourselves connected by a line . The fish did not panic and bolt . It just stopped where it was like a balky mule with all four feet dug in . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , mistaking my lure for the real thing on which it had been feasting , it bit my barbed plug and found itself being pricked and tugged at . I could feel its bafflement and indignation through the line . I could feel it toss its head as it tried impatiently to shake the hook . Then it made a run ; the drag of my reel was loosened to give it its head . One hundred yards it went before I could rein it in . I was using 20-pound-test line , and the odds were long that my fish weighed much less than that , yet , fresh-hooked and full of fight , it easily had the power to break the line . I lowered my rod tip and pumped . I gained line , the fish took it . For a quarter of an hour this tug-of-war went on . At the end I was almost as spent as the fish . // I coaxed my fish in at last on an incoming wave and beached it . I knew not to put my hand in its mouth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fingers . Nor did I pick it up by the tail while it was still alive . Bluefish are limber , like sharks , able to bend double and bite you . I beat my fish to death with a billy club . // Unlike freshwater fish , solitaries that drive others of their kind out of their territories , saltwater fish school . Where you catch one you are apt to catch more . Bluefish hunt in packs , like wolves . Sometimes these packs fill acres of water . ( When that happens you are in for an added sensation , unless , as we had that day at Great Point , you have a steady , strong wind at your back : you can smell them . The smell is that of a ripe melon . ) It was plain that we were into such a school , and , there being no legal limit on the catch of bluefish , nor any prohibition against their sale , as there is against the sale of a few saltwater fish and all freshwater game varieties , fish were now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon covered with sand . // There was no time to put them in cars , no time even to shoo away the gulls that alighted to peck at their gills . // The frenzy with which the fish were foraging was imparted to us . Add to this the pounding surf , the wind , the screaming birds , and now the sun rising red and swollen , possibly portending an early end to the fishes ' feeding and to our sport . Meanwhile , on every other cast you hooked one . You grew impatient with the time it took to subdue and land it before you could catch another . Down the line one man was setting his hook , another pumping his bent rod , another beaching a fish , another clubbing one . Seeking to cast farther , I stood in the surf now , wet to my chin . All caution was thrown to that wild wind . The teeming ocean was casting up its bounty to us . It was shortly to prove too much of a good thing . // I was trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wing . Beside me , Al was fighting a fish . I heard a twang , like the crack of a rifle , audible above the wind . When I had freed the bird I turned and found Al reeling in a slack line . It had broken and he had lost his fish and with it his lure and wire leader . A moment later the same thing happened to another fisherman . On my next cast it happened to me. // We tied on longer leaders . When , even with these , we lost lures , we reasoned that our lines had been frayed on submerged rocks . // Our school offish had multiplied and , their numbers goading them to competition among themselves for the baitfish , they were feeding more voraciously than ever . Baitfish exploded everywhere from the water . The birds collided with one another in falling upon them . // Now on every cast you hooked a fish , only to lose it . I watched one man alone lose what he told me were 22 plugs , costing $3 to $4 apiece @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the waves and the wind and the clamorous birds and the frenzied fish and the very frustration of it goading you on . The more of them you lost the more determined you were to land this one . And you would think you were going to . You would regain line , feel the fish finally tire , its will and its resistance weaken , walk it down the beach to somewhat quieter water . Then it was gone like all the others , taking with it yet another of your lures . Al had been cleaned out , was using mine and losing them . // All were mystified by what was happening to us . It was the man at the body shop who later enlightened us . A native Nantucketer and a fisherman himself , he explained that our trouble had been simply too many fish . When a bluefish , one of a large school such as we had run into , is hooked , he told us , the others bite the line , the swivels , even bits of weed caught on the line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that of a baitfish. // By 10 o'clock the other fishermen , out of lures , or out of patience , or both , had departed , leaving the beach to us . Al had gone through his half of my lures ; finally I lost my last one . We exhumed our fish , and I began to recover from the spell I had been under . // I was not sorry to quit , though I had had to be forced to do it . Only then did I realize how tired I was  --  contented but tired , and sore all over  --  and I had yet to fillet and freeze my share of all those fish as soon as I got them home . // And before I could do that , as I remembered only now , I had to make the return trip over that road .
