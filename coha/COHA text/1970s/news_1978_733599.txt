txt A spectacular sunset lighted the evening sky over the Panama Canal as the United States Senate in Washington was ratifying the second ' of two canal treaties . In a way , the sunset was symbolic of the approaching end of a colorful era that had witnessed the building of the waterway despite all obstacles and its smooth operation by the U.S. for 64 years . But the symbolism was lost on most people in both the Canal Zone and neighboring Panama City . In ' neither place did they seem happy . There was an atmosphere of gloom here in the zone as residents awaited the expected outcome of the Senate vote that spells joint operation of the canal for 22 years and then its takeover by Panama in the year 2000 . " All that is left is for us to pack up our tents and then not so slowly slink away , " commented a veteran of World War II who has worked on the canal for 30 years as he listened to the vote at the American Legion club here . A woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country , and my senators , and everything this means , " she sobbed . For many in the zone , however , the vote was anticlimactic . Months of waiting while the Senate deliberated had in a sense drained away the outbursts of anger and bitterness , leaving most zonians , as residents here are called , certain of the outcome . In fact , April 18 was like any other day in the zone . Thousands of workers turned up at their appointed tasks , and absenteeism was less than normal . Schools were open . The same was true in Panama City ( which lies cheek-by-jowl with the zone ) , where Pan- amanians did little celebrating . There were a number of typical Panamanian bands on the tops of trucks at the Plaza Cinco de Mayo . But the crowds were small , and the expected dancing in the streets to the music of the bands was , in the words of one guitarist , " disappointing . " Panama City simply did not appear to be in a celebrating mood . The countryside was similarly quiet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than ever to controlling the waterway , most Panamanians apparently do not much care . April 19 , the day after the vote , declared a national holiday by the government , looked much like a Sunday . Thousands of Panamanians rushed to the beaches and countryside , grateful for a day off . What fireworks there were were provided by Gen. Omar Torrijos Herrera , the chief of government , who angrily told a press conference that his patience with the U.S. was about exhausted . Had the Senate not ratified the treaties , he commented , he was prepared to take matters " into our own hands . " Warning that if the U.S. were to intervene in Panama at sonic future date Panama would invade the zone , he added that the National Guard had the capacity " to destroy the canal . " Although General Torrijos 's words were seen in some circles as simply so much bombast , there was anger here in the Canal Zone over what was widely described as " his poor taste . " " When you have won the round , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quit swinging . " Another zonian commented : " If he thinks he can close the canal , let him try . He would be surprised at how fast we can keep him from doing it . "
