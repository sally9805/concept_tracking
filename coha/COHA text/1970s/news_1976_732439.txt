txt The Senate aging subcommittee on long term care has produced material that it says points to a growing scandal in the care of - the elderly  --  the " warehousing " or old , mentally ill people who have been pushed out of state mental hospitals into substandard profitmaking boarding houses that are supported by a Federal welfare program . The findings are included in a report to be released in New York City tomorrow by the subcommittee chairman , Senator Frank E. Moss , Democrat of Utah , The report tells of boarding houses that provide room and board of questionable quality and no recreational activity or medical services for the cost of the resident 's Supplemental Security Income check . Potential residents in these homes are 2.5 million old people in need of mental health services that do not exist , the report said . " Throughout America , a forprofit boarding house industry is expanding to meet a need ? a roof for unwanted thousands caught in a bureaucratic revolving door which sends them from mental hospitals to nowhere and back again , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // patients in Nebraska who were admitted and discharged from state mental hospitals a total Of 127 times among them . The boarding house problems include many of the unsafe , unsanitary and inhumane conditions found in nursing homes and single-room occupancy hotels , which have become repositories for patients discharged from state mental hospitals . In the last decade . Federal figures show , almost half of the half-million state mental hospital patients were discharged as part of a decade-old community mental health movement . A disproportionately high percentage were elderly . That effort , begun by President Kennedy , sought to end warehousing in state institutions through the development of about 4,500 communitybased mental health centers , most of them clinics . Only 443 are in operation , and Federal support has been reduced . In the interim , the Federal Government enacted and began in 1974 the Supplementary Security Income program for the elderly poor and disabled ? as former inmates of mental hospitals are classified  --  and set a basic level of out-of-institution support for them . Without Federal support , comprehensive local programs never developed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years in institutions , were discharged into strange communities away from family or friends , without comprehensive services . Some find their way into nursing homes , but the report says , nursing homes do not want them and many are too dangerous to be placed with health patients . Many have no access to medication they received in hospitals and engage in bizarre behavior such as drinking from toilets , the report said . Others are " overmedicated " without medical supervision in some boarding houses . It costs a state at least $12 , - 000 a year to house a mental patient , the report says . As outpatients , however , the former inmates are entitled to a Federal welfare stipend that is not available to them or the institution when they are state patients , the report says , and the states have a financial incentive not to readmit them as patients . Man 's Inhumanity to Man ' Into that void stepped the profit-making hoarding homes . " Operators understand that the way to make a profit is to cut hack on food , staff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " Whatever is not spent becomes profit . " To make matters worse , there is absolutely no accountability . No states require boarding home operators to file cost reports to show how money is being used , " he said . " The inevitable conclusion is that the quality of the homes is at best marginal , and at worst , it is a cruel act and intolerable exploitation of helpless human beings ranking with prisons and concentration camps as prime examples of man 's inhumanity to man , " the report says . It recommends Congressional action , including changes in the Medicare , Medicaid and Supplemental Security Income programs to provide more psychiatric care for the elderly . The report is the seventh of a series by the subcommittee on the failure of various types of nursing home care in America . It is entitled " The Role of Nursing Homes in Caring for Discharged Mental Patients ( and the Birth of a for-Profit Boarding Industry ) . " The report supports in detail one released last month by Andrew Stein , a Democratic New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the state , many concentrated in Queens and Long Island . Senator Moss said he visited many of these homes . " I have seen broken windows letting the cold air into rooms without radiators . " he said . " 1 have seen leaking roofs and holes in ceilings . I have seen hungry people with their faces up against vending machines begging for a quarter . " It became evident to me , " he continued . " that operators were cutting corners every way they could in order to maximize profits . Apparently , mental patients are a good investment in New York as well as in Illinois , " Mr. Moss said . One Chicago home operator reported earning $185,000 in profit from $400,000 in Federal annuity payments for 180 former mental patients . Senate investigators went to New York today in preparation for a hearing on hoarding homes tomorrow at the New York County Lawyers ' Association , 14 Vesey Street , and they visited several home . At the Elmhurst Manor Adult Home , 100-30 ' Ditmars Boulevard , subcommittee investigators reported findings a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ percent of them dismissed mental patients . During the visit , investigators said that carpeting and other renovation material was being delivered as part of a general refurbishing . The Supplemental Security Income recipients at the home receive $1 a month spending allowance , they told investigators today , after turning over to operators checks that average $386 a month . The Federal Government gives all who qualify a basic monthly stipend of $157 . Some states , including New York , supplement that amount , but They usually spend less in the supplement than they did under state-run welfare programs . A spokesman for Social Security said of the growth of boarding homes : " This situation concerns us because the practice leaves recipients without any money for their personal needs . " He said that while the New York State Board of Welfare sets allowance rates for such institutions , compliance is voluntary . Most states have no such rule , he said .
