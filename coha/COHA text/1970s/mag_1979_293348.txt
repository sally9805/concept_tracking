Bloomington , Ill. , creates a bend in U.S. 66 , midway on the long , straight run across the dark prairie from St. Louis to Chicago . A traveler notices the sign - POPULATION 41,500-and wonders why the place resonates slightly in the mind . Is this the Bloomington of the movie Breaking Away ? No , that Bloomington is in Indiana . Ah ! Memory serves . This Bloomington is the place where Adlai Stevenson II grew up a renegade ( i.e. , a Democrat ) and now lies buried with his ancestors , men of substance in the town since the very beginning ; men who had urged a Republican circuit lawyer named Abraham Lincoln to run for President . <P> The traveler , a Middle Westerner turned self-made Eastern snob , assumes nothing else interesting has ever happened in Bloomington . The traveler is wrong . Bloomington , Ill. , is the county seat of McLean County . If you are talking corn and soybeans , McLean County is the capital of the world . If you are talking heartland , you are standing on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , divided on the plot map into square-mile sections still owned by descendants of German and Scotch-Irish immigrants who cleared and settled their way across Pennsylvania , Kentucky and Indiana , out onto the prairie . If you are talking history in McLean County , you are talking about a place that has achieved its destiny , and now has time for a backward look . The traveler discovers the pathos of the conquest of the prairie sod , and romance in the development of hybrid corn by the Funk Brothers Seed Co . <P> Such stories are regional legacies , essential to understanding of time and place . All over the U.S. they now are being reclaimed from attics , dusty files and the memories of the old timers by the phenomenal burgeoning of local historical societies . <P> Over the past 20 years or so , for example , the McLean County Historical Society has been keeping an eye on an object in its care known as the McNulta time capsule . The McNulta in question , a Bloomington man , was a Civil War general in the 94th @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bottle , seven inches high and sealed with a broken stopper , containing several mysterious thin packages wrapped in cloth . A notification tucked into its base read : " Souvenirs of the meeting of the Society of the Army of Tennessee . Held at Chicago November 1879 . To be kept unopened for 100 years . " <P> McNulta went upstate to Chicago in 1895 , and died in 1900 at the age of 62 . In 1858 he had started moving west from New York City , working as a horse dealer and " race rider . " He sold tobacco in Bloomington , enlisted in the Army in 1861 and made brigadier general in four years . But in 1874 he was defeated for reelection to the U.S. Congress by Adlai Stevenson ( Adlai Stevenson the first , people stress in McLean County , meaning the one who went on to become Vice President under Grover Cleveland from 1893 to 1897 ) . McNulta read law , as was the go-getter 's custom , and almost certainly profited by his duties as appointed receiver for an extraordinary number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time and place , and he thought in terms of securing the future .
