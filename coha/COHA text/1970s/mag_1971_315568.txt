THE ADOLESCENT by Fyodor Dosfoevsky . A new translation by Andrew R. MacAndrew. 585 pages . Doubleday . $10 . <P> <P> To judge by the red-blue-green-gold psychedelic dust jacket , the emphasis on " a new translation , " and the streamlined title ( it used to be A Raw Youth ) , one might conclude that the world 's greatest novelist is somehow becoming obsolete . For today 's readers , apparently , Dostoevsky needs to be dressed up in motley and passed off as an expert on the generation gap or the counterculture . Indeed , the jacket blurb describes this 97-year-old novel as a work of " extraordinary timeliness . " <P> Undeniably , the traditional translation by Constance Garnett ( done in 1916 ) had a quality of oak paneling and stained-glass windows ( not to say cobwebs ) , and Professor MacAndrew 's new version is brisk and straightforward . A typical Garnett phrase like " bother the fellow " has become " the hell with him . " And those elaborate patronymics have disappeared , so that Tatyana Pavlovna is now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up-to-date , MacAndrew also afflicts us with such colloquialisms as " know-how " and " twerp . " Mrs. Garnett 's simple statement , " Do n't be angry , Prince , I 'll leave you , " turns into " Take it easy , Prince , I 'll make myself scarce . " <P> Is this really necessary ? Should a 19th century novel try to read like a 20th century novel ? Do Bach 's harpsichord preludes really sound better on a Moog synthesizer ? Does a modern-dress version of Hamlet really make Shakespeare seem modern , and therefore by implication better ? More relevant ? Is any new translation really going to cast a new light on Dostoevsky 's least popular major novel ? <P> Gibberish . Even the author admitted he had thrown together " enough material for four novels . " Turgenev described A Raw Youth as " sour stuff-the stench of the sickroom , unprofitable gibberish . " And on the occasion of this new edition , John Updike condemns the novel for a " penetrating badness that casts doubt over even the peaks of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrong . The novel has never been popular because it is long , repetitious and confusing . But it is a marvelous book , fully worthy of the master who had just finished The Possessed and was soon to write The Brothers Karamazov . It is true that it attempts to portray " an age of the golden mean and insensitivity , of a cult of ignorance and idleness ... and of a longing for the readymade . " But its greatness lies not in its timeliness but in its transcendence over time . <P> The Adolescent 's two principal themes are universal : the search for the father and the search for a meaning in life . They tormented Dostoevsky with a special force , for he was endlessly haunted by the revelation , at age 17 , that his feared and hated father had been murdered by a band of his own serfs , including several whose daughters the elder Dostoevsky had molested . Patricide ultimately became the core of The Brothers Karamazov . Before confronting that , however , Dostoevsky had to write " this first trial flight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
