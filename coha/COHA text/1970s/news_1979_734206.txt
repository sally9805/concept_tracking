txt IF YOU WANT to know what the weather was like at 7:30 a.m . ' July 1 , 1863 , in Gettysburg , Pa. , just ask Joseph Eisendrath of Highland Park . The 70-year-old businessman can tell you that at that time  --  the start of three thunderous days of the Battle of Gettysburg  --  it was oppressively hot with " a blood-red sun , " intense humidity , rain , and a gentle southerly wind . Eisendrath has spent years compiling more than 10,000 index cards with specific references to day-to-day weather in almost every theater of the America i Civil War . " Weather has so much to do with the outcomes of battles , " he said . But because there were no daily weather reports from that period , he painstakingly searched scores of diaries , histories , biographies , and old War Department records for bits and pieces of information . EISENDRATII. a coin bank manufacturer . is among a welter of would-be warriors who meet every month at the Chicago Bar Association to discuss the War Between the States . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buffs still battle // Table , an untiring fraternity of about 300 die-hard Civil War buffs . They know the troop dispositions and tactics used in the battles , and the generals who fought them . They 're also sharp students on President Lincoln . Moreover , they know a lot about those " gone with the wind ' ' days . Like Lisendrath , who knows the weather , each Round Table member has a Civil War specialty . AN AUTHORITY on the railroads is Charles Wesselhoeft , a Chicago hank vice president . Edward C , Johnson , a funeral director , is an expert on Civil War period embalming , graves , and lunerals , Brooks Davis , the manager of a furniture showroom in the Merchandise Mart , is a student on the Battle of Perryville 18621 . And Dan Lapinski , president of a plumbing a n d heating firm , is a student on the numerous legends surrounding t h e corpse of John Wilkes Booth , Lincoln 's assassin . The Round Table has plenty of factions , too . For instance , one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At their evening meetings , while ii , e clock chimes away the hours and smoke spins slowly under the lights , the buffs sit and talk , persuade1 second-guers , browbeat , and burst into fits of friendly annoyance over a certain general 's decision in a time of crisis . " The Civil War was the most romantic period of our history , " said Ralph Newman , Chicago 's official archivist and noted Lincoln scholar , who cofounded the group . " SOMEONE ONCE called it ' the last war fought b e t w e e n gentlemen , ' he said . " It was the country 's last old-fashioned war , and the first modern mar simultaneously . The remarkable thing of it was that during the four war years- - in that narrow hourglass of our nation 's history  --  we had a lot of great men living at the same time in the country 's greatest crisis . " Even today we measure things by Civil War standards  --  as great a statesman as Lincoln , as good a fighter as Ulysses Grant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no marches as great as ' Battle Hymn of the Republic ' ; there are no books or movies as great as ' Gone with the Wind ' ; and there is n't a poem as noble as ' John Brown 's Body ' . . . . " Another appeal for the buffs is th .. t the Civil War was uniquely American , " We did n't share it with anyone , " said Newman . " In the war we were both the victors and the vanquished . " The Round Table began in 1940 after Newman opened his Abraham Lincoln Book Shop on Madison St. , which specializes in the Civil War and Lincoln . NEWMAN , AUTHOR of several books Column 1 on Lincoln , often closed his shop , now at 18 E. Chestnut St. , to meet friends to discuss " the great American conflict " over lunch . In time , that group grew . " We got too big for lunch ; so we decided to hare monthly get-togethers , " Newman said . The club has since spearheaded afoul 150 other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Germany , Australia , and Japan . Locally , the members have written more than 300 Civil War books and have a Civil War collection books , manuscripts , ? Lincolnania , posters , letters , documents , uniforms , flags , weapons , currency , photographs , and diaries that is valued at several million dollars . THE MEMBERS also do their own field work . Annually the group go ... s south to tramp over one or more of the Civil War 's famous battlefields . They do n't re-enact the battles . Instead tlrey study the terrain by hiking down roads , trudging across fields , scrambling into and out of ravines , and climbing over fences . Sometimes local Civil War scholars lecture during their explorations . One year , for instance , the enthusiasts trailed back and forth along the deliberately confusing but strategic trails used by " Stonewall " Jackson , a Confederate general , in the Shenandoah Valley campaign of 1862 . Another year they went by bus along the 80-mile route of Union Gen. William Sherman 's famous march from Chattanooga , Tenn. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Glen Wishes Chicago 's Round Table president . " It sure beats being an armchair strategist back in Chicago . " %VITO ALL the research and field work they have done , and all the books they have written and read on the Civil War , these " vicarious warriors , " as some members of the Round Table call themselves , are a tough audience for anyone who speaks at their monthly meetings . " Woe to any speaker who is not yell documented , " said Neuman , " for the members will fire away mercilessly with penetrating questions or rebuttals . " To some of their meetings , the members bring original song sheets for a round of old-fashioned battlefield singing ? such soul-stirring tunes as " Just Before the Battle , Mother , " " Marchir , g Through Georgia , " " Tenting Tonight on the Old Camp Grounds , " " The Yellow Rose of Texas , " and , certainly , " Dixie . " The buffs are quick to emphasize , however , that the Civil War was not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a terrible war , " said Newman . " More than 617,000 soldiers died  --  that 's the most dead of any U.S. war . " But at least the war accomplished something , " he said . " Carl Sandburg once said it was a war over a verb . Before 1865 , it was the United States are : And after 1865 , it was the United States is . No American can contemplate that fact without emotion .
