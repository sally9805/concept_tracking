txt President Nixon is known to be feeling extremely enthusiastic over his latest campaign to pull the public 's attention away from Watergate and thus to let him get down to governing the nation . Yet neither elections , polls , nor Monitor soundings around the country show that Mr. Nixon is on an upward climb in terms of public approval . As he spoke over radio in behalf of his education bill ( emphasizing fund control at the local level and anti-busing provisions ) , Mr. Nixon was assessing his recent Chicago , Nashville , and Houston appeamnces as distinct pluses . And he was mapping out a series of new activities , trips at home and abroad together with numerous speeches and question-and-answer sessions . Still an issue However , Watergate-related events still continued to tug at public attention . The Senate Judiciary Committee 's struggle to get 42 White House tapes from the Preisdent persisted . Even while presidential aide Bryce Harlow was indicating that Mr. Nixon would accept a compromise on the tapes , another aide , press secretary Ron Ziegler , reacting to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn over the tapes , was saying the President was sticking to his guns on not releasing them . Meanwhile , it was reported here that Republican Senate leader Hugh Scott had told presidential counsel James D. St. Clair that Mr. Nixon must somehow avoid a confrontation over delivering the 42 tapes ? or be impeached . Sen. Howard Baker ( R ) of Tennessee , vice-chairman of the Senate Watergate Committee , on " Face the Nation " said of the 42-tape question : " The time for conciliation is at hand . " He hoped both sides would be willing to give a little . He said that the President should be " forthcoming " in producing the tapes that are " relevant . " Asked if he thought impeachment would follow if the President did not give up the tapes , the Senator said , " I hope not . " Instead , he saw both the committee and the President finding accommodation on the tapes . // *Nixon sees upturn in political fortunes , but polls do n't // Actually , the persuasive reference points ? elections @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at long last is on an upwaid climb in terms of public approval . Elections recalled The special congressional races held over the last several weeks in Pennsylvania , Michigan , Ohio , and California have provided strong indication , in fact , that the voters still are preoccupied with Watergate-related charges and investigations . Thus , the upcoming Michigan congressional election ( April 16 ) will be watched closely for signs of a Nixon upturn . Further , the national polls now have the President down to his lowest point yet ? 25 percent in Gallup and 26 percent in Harris . But the President now is getting encouraging reports ? from congressmen and more-localized polls ? which are telling him that his recent meetings with questioners via TV have met with vast public approval . Encouragement in Florida The President was receiving similar encouraging reports more than a month ago during a weekend in Florida . At that time information , coming from similar sources , was telling Mr. Nixon the worst was over and that he was beginning to edge up in public opinion . Such a rise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ national polls . Continuing conversations with Republican leaders throughout the United States by this reporter have yet to indicate that Mr. Nixon is making much headway . These Republicans , who would normally be expected to be the first to sight a pro-Nixon trend , have yet to report a resurgent Nixon in the states in which they reside and in which they are particularly well placed to make soundings . These Republicans in recent weeks have tended to stress the President 's troubles elsewhere ? on the economic front in particular . But many , citing the woes of inflation and the energy crisis , have admitted that Watergate and the President 's continuing woes over Watergate still lay there ? underscoring and emphasizing and making all the President 's other problems worse than they otherwise would have been . A typical comment from these leaders came from a Midwest national committeeman who said : " The President certainly is buoying those hard-core Republicans who have never questioned him over Wa tergate . These people are really heartened by Mr. Nixon 's new efforts to fight back . " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nixon last time ? Republicans as well as Democrats ? who have become terribly disenchanted with the President . Many feel he has let them down . Now among those voters I have yet to see much of a move to forgive and forget . Many have had it with Nixon and think Ford should take over . Nope , I think Nixon has a long way yet to go before he makes a big comeback with the voters . " A national chairman from the West put it this way : " Look , I 'm ready for a Nixon comeback , I need it if we are going to have any chance in the fall elections . " But I simply do n't see signs of it yet . When I do , you can be certain I will be standing on a mountaintop here and shouting it . You will hear about it . " True , in some rural areas there still are Republican leaders who say that Watergate has never been an issue there . But some of them will admit , reluctantly , that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in getting good people to work for the party . Some report that campaign contributions have been slow in coming in , too .
