txt This article is based on interviews conducted by Arthur Veysey , chief of The Tribune 's London Bureau . Silt HUGH BEAVER , a crack shot and a rich man , fired at a Golden Plover . He missed . And that is how the Guinness Book of World Records was born . It was a curious start for a book , but it is a cttrious book . The Guinness Book of World Records is well on its way to becoming the most successful Norris and Ross : the " ologists of the eds. " publishing venture in history . except for the Bible . Its 671 pages detail more than 10,000 " ests , " from the tallest man Chleago'i Don Koehler at 8 feet , 2 inches to the fattest cat 48 pounds . IT IS . JAMPACKED with lowests , oldests , longests , masts , fewests , and firsts , enough to elevate it to the status of a basic reference work along with the dictionary , the encyclopedia , and the Old Farmer 's Almanac . Curious , too , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Ross , who call themselves the " ologists of the ests . " The youthful-looking twins , who are 48 , do all the writing together and check the facts together . In fact , they do nearly everything together . THEY BOTH GRADUATED from Oxford , where both Were on the track team . They served in the Royal Navy together . They both do radio and television commentaries for the BBC , and both are contributors to the Encyclopaedia Brittanlca . Both are married . Both have two children . They dress alike . They even answer questions together , as when they explained about Sir Hugh and the Golden Plover . " It all began by chance one day , " said Norris . " In September , 1954 , " said Ross . " SIR HUGH BEAVER , " said Norris , " spelled like the animal , " said Ross , " was out shooting , " said Norris , " on the River Slaney , " .. said Ross , " in Southern Ireland , " said Norris . " Sir Hugh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " That night he said he 'd never seen a bird fly so fast . Why , he said , the Golden Plover must be the fastest bird in the world . So he started asking around . " As it happened , the brothers explained , Sir Hugh could ' not find a book with the answer . But because he was a rich man , and the owner of Guinness Breweries , he decided that . he would cause such a book to exist . " He said it was over facts like this that arguments , began in pubs , " said Ross . " AND BRITAIN has 73,000 pubs , " said Norris . It was a ready-made market for Sir Hugh 's planned book , and he went to the twins because they operated a small fact-finding service in London 's Fleet Street . The brothers took on the job , and in 16 weeks of 18-hour days , they wrote a slim volume with a first printing order of 20,000 copies . From then on it was a rocket ride , a publisher 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are chief officers of Guinness Superlatives , Ltd. , a subsidiary of the brewery . They have sold more than 19 million copies in the first 20 years ' since Sir Hugh missed his shot at the Golden Plover . Among secular books , only Dr. Benjamin Spock 's Baby . and Child Care , with 25 million copies sold to date , is a bigger success . " We ca n't really forget the Bible , " said Ross . " It 's estimated that between 1800 and 1850 some billion and a half Bibles were printed . " NORRIS SAID they take advance orders ' every year and in October they close the order book , printing only enough books to fill the orders , a quantity running to about 6 million a year now . The United States paperback edition alone keeps one press going year-round . " And that 's only the English edition , " Ross said . " The book now appears in 15 languages . " " We keep nothing in type , " said Ross . " My brother and I write each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vast body of basic reference information that includes the bizarre and the trivial along with the more weighty claims to superlative fame . " WE LIKE TO Include people with special talents , " said Ross . " Like the boy with the photographic memory who can reel off the figure for pt ( the ratio of a circle 's diameter to its circumference , 3.14159265 . .. etc. down to 1,200 places . " " He does it in four minutes , 20.2 seconds , " said Norris . The brothers checked the boy against a book that carries pi down to a half-million places . That book , incidentally , is called by the " the most boring book in the world . " There seems no end to the collection of trivia the have gathered into their book . There are , for example , the Guinness records for the largest and smallest brains ever recorded . They belonged to two of the western world 's greatest writers , Ivan Turgenev ( whose brain weighed 4 lbs. , 6.96 oz.1 and Anatole France 12 lbs. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should submit carefully authenticated claims if they want their names , and their accomplishments , to he enshrined in the Guinness book . According to the preface to the 1974 edition , authentication should include newspaper clippings and a document signed " by an independent adult individual or representative of an organization of standing in the community . " Chicago figures prominently in the book . The cover of the 1974 edition features photographs of Koehler , the tallest man , and of Sears Tower , the tallest building ; dozens of other Chicogo record holders are ' sprinkled thru its pages . The U. S. paperback edition , in fact , is printed in Chicago . " I love Chicago , " Norris said . " So brisk . It is not known as the Windy City for nothing . " ACCORDING TO the book , tho , It is not the windiest place . That honor goes to Commonwealth Bay , George V Coast , Antarctica , where the breezes run up to 200 miles per hour . The strongly disapproved of dangerous records , such as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the book contains such records as that of Robert L. Foster , Richmond , Cal. , who stayed - under water for 13 minutes and 42.5 seconds without taking a breath . And there is the record set by a hard drinker named Vqnhorn who died in London in 1811 . Ile drank more than four bottles of ruby port every day for 23 years , emptying 35,688 bottles and winning immortality in the Guinness book as " The Most Alcoholic Person . " The take great pride in the accuracy of their book , and they are seldom caught in ' an error . " WE FORE ? ' Elt GET letters from irate schoolmasters saying they 've taught for 40 years and do n't we know that geography books have said such and such , " Norris said . " We write back and tell them the geography books are wrong . " He said they check every record annually to make sure it still stands . SOMETIMES THE brothers will eliminate an entry if it causes personal hardship to the record holder . For example , they removed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because he had gone straight and the book was making life difficult for him . Still , the have made a few mistakes . Like the big oversight in the first edition of Sir Hugh 's book : There was no mention of the fastest bird in the world . " It turned out not to be the Golden Plover , " Norris said , " but the Spur Wing Goose . " The twins got busy on that one . and now , Sir Hugh , you can find on Page 80 of your book that the Spur Wi ig Goose can fly SO miles an hour in level flight , and 88 hi an escape dive . The Golt:c . ) Plover is nowhere in the running .
