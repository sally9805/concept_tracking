Leon Jaworski , Archibald Cox 's replacement as special Watergate prosecutor , has within the past weeks sent four letters to the White House requesting additional notes , memoranda and tapes of key presidential con ? versations . Athong the items he requested is the record ? ing of the President 's April 19 , 1971 telephone conver ? sation with then Attorney General Richard Kleindienst ? a call during which the President told the attorney general in curt language to drop plans for a govern ? ment appeal to the Supreme Court of one of the ITT merger cases . It could be an important piece of evi ? dence in the special prosecutor 's inquiry into whether perjury was committed before the Senate Judiciary Committee during its 1972 hearings on Kleindienst 's nomination . It also could be relevant to the inquiry into whether ITT 's promised contribution of $400,000 to the Republican Party 's convention was in any way tied to resolving its antitrust difficulties . The White House is studying whether to turn the April 19 telephone call tape over to Mr. Jaworski , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ House sources , the President 's counsel already is preparing to give the special prosecutor three other requested taped coversations ? April 16 , 1973 between the President and John Dean ; April 18 , 1973 between the President and Assistant Attorney General Henry Petersen when the President offered to play a " tape " of the now missing April 15 , 1973 talk with John Dean ; and June 4 , 1973 , the tape of President Nixon receiv ? ing and playing 12 hours of tapes of his March and April 1973 meetings with John Dean . There is a particular irony to these Jaworski requests and the apparent White House compliance . Less than two months ago Cox was fired for refusing to agree to drop all further requests for presidential papers or tapes . In the negotiations leading up to his dismissal , Cox specifically cited the Nixon-Kleindienst phone call as the type of tape he would need in the future . Three days before Cox was fired , former Attorney Gen ? eral Elliot Richardson told White House presidential counsel J. Fred Buzhardt that Cox wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said flatly that the special prosecutor would have no right to it . Although Cox is gone , Jaworski appears to be build ? ing his investigation on the foundation Cox laid . Thus to see where that operation is headed , one has to review where the Watergate special prosecution force stood when Cox was fired and Richardson quit . Both men appeared last month before the Senate Judiciary Com ? mittee and their testimony , along with other material , permits a good look at the overall Cox inquiry and the discreet but important role Richardson played in it . Beginning in the last weeks of May , Cox took almost two months to put together his staff of between 40 and DECEMBER 8 , 1973 50 lawyers . Five specific areas were established and are being investigated today . The first is directed at the Watergate break-ins and the cover-up that followed arrest of five men inside Democratic Party headquarters June 17 , last year . Although the President has roundly criticized Cox for his delay in seeking indictments in the Watergate af ? fair , the former @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still be explored before making what Cox termed " the most difficult decisions " ? determination of who , if anyone , should be indicted . Mr. Jaworski apparently agrees with this assessment , and the three Cox inquiries are being pursued . They are : follow-up on leads provided by John Dean after Dean 's October 18 plea of guilty to a charge of conspir ? ing to obstruct justice ; follow-up on information con ? tained in presidential tapes that eventually will be turned over to the grand jury ; and reexamination of former CIA Director Richard Helms as a consequence of a recently discovered Helms memorandum , ap ? parently written 11 days after the break-in and arrests which , in Cox 's words , " seemed to be totally at odds with everything else he had said and that a number of other people had said " in their . grand jury testimony . Although Cox-believes that Dean 's testimony could " open new avenues , " he has no great admiration for , Dean . He said that the former White - House counsel " had rendered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . up to a five-year sentence and to a very heavy fine . . . I thought that would be an entirely proper disposition of the case against any defendant who pleaded guilty . " The second major subject of the Cox inquiry was unlawful campaign contributions and any government actions that may have been taken as a result of spe ? cific contributions . Several corporations have already pleaded guilty to making illegal cash contributions out of corporate funds but , according to Cox , these were the " simple and straightforward cases . " Other investi ? gations in this area are " at difficult and critical stages , " and some " are scarcely beginning because evidence has just come to light . " Among the still outstanding investigations ' are the publicized donations by milk producers and , according to Cox , " the question of whether they had undue influence on certain govern ? ment decisions , " specifically the Nixon administra ? tion 's 1971 decision to reverse itself and raise the fed ? eral subsidy on milk . Another Cox-begun inquiry was into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partic ? ularly that by Nixon lawyer Herbert Kalmbach under the direction of H. R. Haldeman . Called " Operation Town House , " it primarily channeled unreported funds into GOP Senate . and House races in 1970 . In the last weeks before his dismissal , Cox approved an inquiry into the $100,000 in cash given presidential friend Charles ( Bebe ) Rebozo in 1969 and 1970 by rep-11 resentatives of millionaire Howard Hughes . Cox 's de ? cision angered the President . According to Richardson , Mr. Nixon in early October wanted to know why Cox was " looking into what Bebe Rebozo is doing even though that has already been the subject of a thorough investigation by the Internal Ikevenue Service . " Cox could hardly ignore the Rebozo story , since it had been widely publicized in newspapers . But he pro ? ceeded in the most meticulous way . He sent a mem ? orandum to Thomas McBride , chief of the unit looking into campaign contributions , instructing him to " pro ? ceed without consulting " Cox . " My brother 's law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Cox explained . " I wished to be sure that that relationship did not re ? sult in the staff feeling we should go easy . " So the Rebozo inquiry , that Richardson said caused " sensi ? tivity " within the White House shortly before Cox 's ouster , was not even being directed by Cox . A third area of study was 1972 campaign " dirty tricks . " With the conviction last month of campaign saboteur Donald Segretti all that remained to be deter ? mined , according to Cox , was " whether persons above Segretti had or did not have any responsibility for . . . the unlawful tricks in which he was engaged . " That inquiry focusses particularly on two former Nixon aides , appointments secretary Dwight Chapin and Haldeman assistant Gordon Strachan . Chapin 's in ? dictment for perjury stemmed from this investigation . Cox 's fourth area was described broadly as " poten ? tial criminal offenses involving the abuse or attempted abuse of governmental power .. or agencies of the government . " Within this category Cox lumped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , House special investigations unit that among other things planned and executed the break-in at the office of Daniel Ells-berg 's psychiatrist . Around September 20 the Cox investigative team was about to bring indictments in this matter . Letters suggesting cooperation were sent to lawyers for some of those involved , particularly former White House aide Charles Colson and the Miami-based Cuban Americans who had carried out the break-in . Word of those letters leaked to the press . White House counsel Buzhardt immediately contacted Richardson and informed him of the possibility that national security could be jeopardized if the case were brought to trial . What the White House reportedly had in mind were intelligence channels through which it was learned that the Russians had copies of the Ells-berg Pentagon papers . Richardson explained the situa ? tion to Cox . As Cox recalled it , " The question whether the return of such an indictment would not endanger the national security was an entirely proper question . I was indebted to the attorney general for raising it . We went back and wrestled with it . " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before his firing , Egil Krogh ? one of the directors of the " plumbers " ? was indicted for making a misstatement under oath . It was a charge , the Cox prosecutors argued , that avoided 12 disclosure of the troublesome national security matter . Whereas Cox exercised extreme caution , his successor , Mr. Jaworski , is said to be less impressed by the na ? tional security aspect . He is moving ahead with in ? dictments akin to those planned by the Cox force . Another area of inquiry is the Nixon administra ? tion 's wiretapping . " The question , " as Cox described it , " is whether such bugging was conducted for pur ? poses of harassment . . . and whether some of the con ? versations overheard were not used for purposes of political intelligence rather than governmental secu ? rity . " In July Cox 's staff sent a questionnaire to all government agencies that could conduct wiretaps . The Secret Service , upon receipt of the letter , protested to the White House . On July 23 presidential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very uptight about Cox , " because of the letter to the Secret Service . Haig , according to Richardson , said " the President wants a tight line drawn and no further mistakes ; if Cox does n't agree we will get rid of Cox . " In fact Cox had been unaware of the sweeping nature of the questionnaire , and it was thereafter modified . But the complaints did not cease . Four days later the White House in the person of Mr. Buzhardt protested the subpoenaing of two Secret Service men , which he characterized to Richardson as " Cox . . . getting into the middle of personal matters . " The subject this time apparently was the wiretapping and surveillance of the President 's brother , Donald . Again , as in the " plumb ? ers " situation , Cox took a conciliatory line . Richard ? son said he did not believe Cox would go any further , once the facts in the case were established . " Not all violations of law are subject to prosecution and the question here would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ potential embarrass ? ment . . . . I have some reason to believe Mr. Cox felt there might be a sort of implicit , if not statutory , ex ? ception at least from the standpoint of prosecutorial discretion . . . . " Though Cox seemed willing to let the administra ? tion off the hook on the bugging of the President 's brother , his staff was tenacious in pursuing other wiretaps . After much hassling , a Cox attorney was per ? mitted to review the FBI files on the 17 so-called na ? tional security wiretaps of White House and other government officials and newsmen . That inquiry also focussed on the 1969 bugging and surveillance of columnist Joseph Kraft . According to Richardson White House counsel Buzhardt said that former White House aide Jack Caulfield " had attempted to tap Kraft in 1969 but apparently it did n't work . " Kraft was out of town and all they overheard was his maid . " So , " added Richardson , " other steps were taken . . . They called on the FBI , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? lance undertaken in Paris by French police . " This was a matter of interest to the Cox staff , " Richardson con ? cluded . On August 27 this year Cox asked the White THE NEW REPUBLIC House to supply " all records relating to . . . electronic surveillance of Joseph Kraft . . . " As Cox described it , " after about a month and a half of discussion on his subject we identified nine specific items that were particularly urgent among them , but according to my records . . . none of those have . . . yet been produced . " The Kraft records and those relating to Krogh and other " plumbers " which had been requested but not produced for Cox are evidently now going to be turned over to Jaworski . Still another line of the Cox inquiry had to do with " some part played by John Ehrlichman in connection with a Gerieral Services Administration contract in New Jersey . " According to Richardson this caused the White House to raise " some question about the basis on which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said that , " it fell within the special prose ? cutor clause dealing with actions of Presidential staff . " The last part of the Cox investigation was one given him by Richardson : inquiries into ITT and hearings on the Kleindienst nomination as attorney general . Although Nixon spokesmen have said the latter in ? quiry was near completion in March 1973 , Cox says almost nothing serious had been done when he began work in May , two months later . Richardson 's decision to turn over the substantial ITT documents that were in the possession of the Justice Department , and to subsequently inform the White House that it had been done , was of course of considerable help to Cox . " In the case of some Krogh papers , " Richardson said , " I also concluded that since they were in the hands of the FBI that we should respond armatically , in effect to the Cox request . " All of this makes plain that Richardson and Cox , friends for some time ; worked well together , and that did not make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late September , when the President was bothered by Cox 's probing , Richardson said he " did get from Mr. Cox an ? overview of the matters that were under investigation and it was understood that I would not repeat to anyone in the White House the full outline of that review . And I did not . " Instead , according to a Richardson aide , the attorney general told General Haig that almost everything Cox was looking into had surfaced publicly before , and there was no need to fear some new bombshell . Haig , how ? ever could not understand why Richardson refused to pass on any details , when the request was being made in the name of the President . Richardson did not produce everything Cox wanted , however . Beginning last August Cox sought access to income tax returns of various individuals . A presiden ? tial executive order is required before those returns are released . According to Richardson , Cox 's request for an executive order " had gotten hung up in the White House . " Cox then suggested that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I never did get it resolved before I left , " Richardson said . The issue is still not resolved and the prosecutors have not been given tax returns . Richardson also wanted to turn over to Cox , White House material in the possession of his civil division and which related to the milk contri ? bution inquiry . In this case he wanted to first get White House approval . But he never had a chance to take the matter up with the President , so the material never went to Cox . When charges were made that the Justice Depart ? ment had backed off on an antitrust suit against the President 's close friend Robert Abplanalp , Cox in ? vestigated and , according to Richardson , " concluded there was no impropriety and very correctly so wrote the department of Justice and the White House . " When a Senate committee charged that favoritism was shown in the grant of commutation of sentence to Mafia figure Angelo DeCarlo , Cox again investigated . Here , said Richardson , " there was nothing in it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and had been unwilling to submit to vol ? untary deposition . " That witness was former Spiro Agnew aide Peter Malatesta . Summing up the Cox inquiry , one former Justice Department official says the White House will soon find it did itself great damage beyond the immediate political impact , by forcing out the first special prose ? cutor and the attorney general who had selected him . " They were both disciplined professionals , moving with great care , " he says . In Richardson the President had a man he neither trusted nor controlled , but Rich ? ardson was able to influence Cox . If Sen. William Saxbe is confirmed as attorney general and Jaworski remains special prosecutor , the White House may find itself with an even less tractable team . In the opinion of one who knows them both , they are like " unguided missiles , both driven in good part by ego . " When President Truman was contemplating the cre ? ation of the Central Intelligence Agency more than a quarter-century ago , Secretary of State George C. Marshall warned against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . seem almost unlimited and need clarification . " Since then the CIA has suc ? cessfully resisted hundreds of attempts by Congress to limit and clarify its powers , and the latW such bid , this time by Senator John C. Stennis of Mississippi , promises by be equally ineffective . Stennis , whose Armed Services subcommittee is supposed to super ? vise the CIA , has consistently protected it against any serious investigation , control or criticism , and , con ? sistent with that practice , his present bill is less a gen ? uine effort to harness the agency than a diversionary tactic designed to prevent other members of Congress , notably Senator William Proxmire , from pushing through stronger measures . The CIA is likely to emerge unscathed again . Even so , other pressures have combined to diminish the CIA 's influence , and , although it continues to carry on covert and sometimes reckless activities , the agency is not quite the sinister " invisible government " ofyears past . For one thing its reputation has suffered badly from misadventures like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well as its tangential involve ? ment in the Watergate scandals , and , as a result , it has fallen prey to the fierce bureaucratic rivalries of Wash ? ington . It has gradually become overshadowed by the Defense Department 's various espionage services , which now account for about 85 percent of the esti ? mated six or seven billion dollars spent annually by what is known in the idiom of the.capital as the " intel ? ligence community . " The biggest of the Pentagon out ? fits is the National Security Agency , whose 25,000 employees manage satellites , fly reconnaissance air ? craft , and , among other jobs , monitor open and secret foreign radio communications from some 400 clandes ? tine bases around the world , all on a budget that runs into the billions . In contrast the CIA staff of 15,000 operates on roughly $750 million per year , and , in many respects , it could not function without military support . Unlike the Defense Department , moreover , the CIA can not seek funds directly from Congress , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Therefore , while he is technically in charge of
