txt There were more than 5,000 peasant women in all , lined up in front of the emergency food post and , tretching hundreds of yards down the dusty road that led back to the farmlands parched by drought . Near the end 01 tile line , propped against a whitewashed wall , was Osalita Rodrigues , six months pregnant , holding an empty basket at her side and a gray tag above her head to ward off the midday sun . She took a gulp of water from a tin can , gargled and spat it out She had set out at dawn , she explained , and walked 12 miles . By daybreak the next day , she would make the same journey back , but loaded with about 10 pounds of food rations . " I have three small children , boss , and my husband was let go three weeks ago , " said Mrs. Rodrigues. " 1 have to be back there tomorrow because there is nothing left to eat except cactus .

The drought has struck here in the state of Bahia and in the adjoining states of Minas Gerais , Piaui and Pernambuco . This is the heart of northeastern Brazil , a million square miles of tropical and semi-arid farmland whose 32 million inhabitants represent the greatest concentration of poverty in Latin America . The northeast 's seemingly insoluble backwardness has created widespread pessimism over the efficacy of the economic development model adopted by Brazil 's 12-year-old right-wing military regime . A Spectacular Surge Through a combination of state capitalism and local private and foreign investment , there has been a spectacular economic surge during the last seven years that saw the gross national product grow by about 10 percent annually . But that growth has been largely confined to central and southern Brazil , stretching from Belo Horizonte , Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo down to Ptrto Alegre .

In all , there are five million jobless or underemployed northeasterners . Nationally , the average annual income is about $750 . In the rurul areas of the northeast , the figure drops to $150 . More than half of northeasterners over 15 years of age are illiterate . With epidemics and malnutrition rampant , the population has the lowest life expectancy in the country. , In the worst rural zones , health authorities estimate that infant mortality is as high as 25 percent . The New York Times/Feb 11 , 1976 The colonization of the country by the Portuguese began in the northeast four centuries ago . Until 100 years ago , the sugar , cocoa and tobacco plantations here accounted for two-thirds of the national economy . Today , the descendants of the African slaves , Indians and poor whites who worked those plantations number almost a third of the country 's population .

Civilian governments promised to industrialize the area . During the 60 's the United States poured several hundred million dollars into the now largely forgotten Alliance for Progress projects . Under the military regime , there were at first hopes that the booming factories of Rio and Sao Paulo would drain the northeast 's reservoir of cheap , unemployed labor , much the same way that industrial growth in the northern United States led to a migration of southern blacks .

After touring the hardesthit zones last week , the Minister of Interior , /Mauricio Rangel Reis , announced that there was no drought , but " an unfavorable climatic situation . " " We can not call this a drought , " added Jose Lins de Albuquerque , who heads the regional development agency . " It is still only a prolonged dryness . " The drought or " prolonged dryness " becomes evident soon ' after a drive out of Salvador , Bahia 's capital and main port . Jungle to Dull Backland The lush jungle terrain outside Salvador gives way to the semi-and " sertdo , " or backlands , where brown , yellow and gray colors submerge the dull , dusty vegetation Tree &; 300 miles to the northwest , was a breadbasket for much of the state .

The inhabitants have gathered in the larger towns hoping to receive food rations or emergency jobs . In the town of Central , just north . of Irece , several hundred peasants had looted a food warehouse . In other small towns , street markets had closed down for fear of pillaging . In Irece , an Italian priest , the Rev. Enzo Ferrone , who is president of the local farmers 's cooperative , is in charge of distributing the Government 's emergency food rations . ' The Cows Are Dying ' ' We give out beans and rice , " he said . " We were also distributing milk . But the cows are dying .

One of the larger emergency projects was being carried out about 20 miles south of Treed outside the village of Gameleira . Some 400 men dropped their machetes and shovels when a water truck drove up to the work site . The man in charge of the group was Bernardino Peceira Miranda , a 49-year-old peasant with nine children , whose small plot had succumbed to the drought " Tell you the truth boss , I do n't know exactly what we are supposed to be doing , " he said " We 're clearing the area , but I do n't know if it 's going to be a road or just a clearing .
