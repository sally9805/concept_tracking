Those who knew Janis Joplin only from her records can be forgiven for wondering quite what the fuss was about . It could not be communicated fully on records-the burning lava flow of energy raising audiences to their feet and into the aisles . But for those who saw her perform even once , it was not easy to forget the gyrating girl in a glowworm mini , all surging emotion boiling up through swirls of curses and Southern Comfort in a Dixie cup . Or the single vivid impression recorded in the mind 's eye that , without the scalding voice and tremulous ostrich plume headdress , she was really rather small . <P> She was the White Queen of the Blues . When she threw back her head to sing she became a lioness . From the moment she stomped , wailed , moaned , sweated her way through Love Is Like a Ball and Chain at the Monterey pop festival in June 1967 until her death three years later from an overdose of heroin , Janis Joplin was the high priestess of rock , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order of Mick Jagger or Jim Morrison . <P> " If the zany creature that the public saw , all that campy , trivial bluster , was real enough in its way , it was far from the substance of her deeper glow , " writes Myra Friedman in Buried Alive ( Morrow ; $7.95 ) . " The hysteria , the extravagance , and the foolish noise were a barren fuss embraced by barren hearts , and it was a lost child who would kick up such rubbish to gain entrance into rooms so empty . " Written with a sympathetic intelligence , at times fiercely lyrical , Buried Alive is an honest book about Joplin the idol and Joplin the victim in the frantic , manic disarray of rock in the ' 60s . A meticulous researcher , Friedman has taken great pains to document the Joplin chronicle as exhaustively as one might document the biography of a statesman-with the result that the large cast of minor characters may be recognizable only to groupies .

A docile , soft-faced child , she was a voluminous reader , and her grades were excellent . No incidents of her early childhood foreshadowed fame - or a life crudely bartered away in exchange for counterfeit thrills from drugs , sex and alcohol . <P> / guess I 'm just like a turtle , Hiding underneath its horny shell . . . <P> More than anything else she wanted to be pretty . But in adolescence her complexion raged and she got fat . A lifelong obsession with personal ugli ness began . Unequal to the conventional standards of Southern femininity , Joplin decided to be its antithesis : she became one of the guys-palling around with boys who drank beer , listened to jazz , and tolerated her because she was willing to play court jester . <P> They call me mean , people call me evil , I 've been called much worse things around , But I 'm gon na take good care of Janis , yeah , honey , Ai n't no one gon na dog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school in 1960 , she was a walking cartoon . Her dress was outlandish , her behavior outrageous . Even the boys were embarrassed by her gamy language and alcoholic escapades at sleazy bars across the river in Louisiana . Classmates took to calling her " Pig . "
