txt The Nation Prices : A Reminder About Who Really Calls the Signals WASHINGTON  --  The ostensibly independent Pay Board and Price Commission were established by the Nixon Administration to make the rules for Phase Two , and they have easily dominated the news in the 10 weeks that have elapsed since Phase One 's 90-day freeze ended on Nov. 14 . But the Administration 's own agency  --  the Cost of Living Council  --  reminded everyone last week that economic controls do not finally rest with the rule-making labor leadets , big businessmen and academics . The council , which oversees Phase Two , sets the pace in imposing the rules strictly or loosely , and retains the power to exempt various sectors of the economy from any regulation . It is also most sensitive to politics ? to the way things look to the nation 's voters in an election year . Last week the council moved on two fronts , creating at least the impression of a stern enforcement effort and freeing from controls some not very vital parts of the economy . On Monday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States attorneys in 93 Federal judicial districts began a week-long drive to force retailers to post lists of their base prices . Merchants with sales of $200,000 a year or more had been required to display by Jan. 1 the amounts they had charged during the freeze for all food items subject to controls and , in the non-food departments , the prices of the most popular items . Most of them did n't . They insisted it was too difficult , and they correctly noted that the information by itself could not be used by consumers to determine whether increases above the freeze levels were legitimate ( it depends , among other things , on undisclosed wholesale prices ) . But the Government believes that the posting serves as a psychological deterrent . Also , shoppers become restless when they see sharp price increases and many feel that the program 's credibility would suffer with no sign of a Federal presence . On Friday , the Government reported that consumer prices rose 0.4 per cent in December , the first full month of Phase Two . This was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but about half of it was caused by uncontrolled items such as fruits and vegetables . The council took considerable pains , as the enforcement sweep went on , to collect figures showing how many places the I.R.S. was investigating . It announced at week 's end that the agents had made 20,076 inspections and had turned in about 1,500 apparent violators . The " bulk " of the recalcitrants would be turned over to Federal prosecutors , the council said , and yesterday the Government announced that it had filed 67 law suits in priceposting cases . This was 13 times as many as had been filed previously during Phase Two . On Wednesday , the council announced that three-fourths of the country 's retailers ( those with annual sales of less than $100,000 ) would be exempt from price regulations and that more than 40 per cent of the rental units ( mostly held by the smallest landlords ) would be freed from any ceiling . The rent program had become messy . It had provided I.R.S. with half its stabilization work , and most of it involved dwellings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Goveriament because rents make up only 5 per cent of the Consumer Price Index . So the council decided to forget 10 million units , including apartments that cost more than $500 a month , houses leased for periods of more than a month ( if the landlord owns no more than four of them ) and the buildings with four units or less ( if the owner lives in one of them ) . Much the same reasoning was applied to the retailers . There are 1.5 million with gross receipts of less than $100,000 a year , but the council found that altogether they generated only 15 per cent of the nation 's retail trade . They are small " mom and pop " groceries , modest dress shops , neighborhood candy and tobacco merchants , country hardware outlets , and similar enterprises . Nearly half of them , the Government said , are run entirely by their owners . There has been much speculation as to how and when the Government would begin to wind down Phase Two , and Donald Rurnsfeld , the council director @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were a straw in the wind . Absolutely not , he said , and added that the Government was now free to concentrate on the biggest and most important economic sectors and that competition from these would keep the little stores and landlords in line . But the action brought to about 20 per cent the proportion of the nation 's total output of goods and services freed from controls . Items such as local , state and Federal taxes , raw agricultural products and life insurance premiums were previously exempted . Exemptions on the wage side are not coming so smoothly , Congress added a provision to the stabilization law last month which was designed to free the " working poor , " but the Government is having trouble defining the point below which a worker would qualify for that designation . The council , which has the power to decide , proposed an exemption for those earning less than $1.90 an hour and asked the Pay Board what it thought . One majority said this was too low ; another majority found $3.50 too high ; still another majority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the issue this week .
