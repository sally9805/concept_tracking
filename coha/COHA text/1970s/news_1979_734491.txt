txt While America remains baffled by an isolated Iran , Britain has seemingly sliced a far more intractable knot . The major obstacles to a cease-fire in Zimbabwe Rhodesia have finally been removed after 13 weeks of non-stop negotiations in London . On what manna did the British feed ? The answer is instructive . It took not supernatural diplomacy but years of pain and failure before all concerned could be persuaded to rise to the level of a ruthless self-interest . That does not minimize the skill of Prime Minister Thatcher and her Foreign Secretary , Lord Carrington . They indeed had the wit to sense that the time was right for a ninth attempt at a settlement , and they managed it brilliantly . But the accidents of history , as much as human design , opened the path to a cease-fire . And the interplay of politics in nations on three continents helped impel blood enemies to turn to a British-supervised election as the best means of resolving the conflict . The vote should be in a matter of months . When Rhodesia 's whites @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held out the alluring promise of preserving minority privileges indefinitely . Few foresaw that Portuguese Africa would gain its independence within a decade , closing off trading ports and opening Rhodesia to wider guerrilla attacks . Without the toll of the guerrilla war , and without the increasing hardships of sanctions , especially British and American , it is hardly imaginable that Rhodesia 's whites would have moved toward last year 's " internal settlement . " Whatever its flaws in excluding the guerrillas , it at least gave the appearance of power to the overwhelming black majority and created a new opportunity . That settlement swelled domestic pressures in Britain and America for an immediate end to sanctions . But both Governments recognized the obvious injury to their interests in Africa , most notably to trade with oi  --  rich Nigeria . The Carter Administration wisely begged time for the British diplomacy . And Mrs. Thatcher , new to office , restrained her preelection enthusiasm for ending sanctions to try to prevent a split in the Commonwealth . The African Commonwealth nations had staunchly supported the Zimbabwe guerrilla movements , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war that was ruinous to their economies . ? In sum , the equilibrium of pain was sufficiently spread to permit Lord Carrington to attempt his highwire act , Ripeness can be all , in diplomacy as in life . War and sanctions had combined to generate incentives to compromise on every side . The diligence of the British at the end was crucial . But so was the general exhaustion . Mutual concessions on such key matters as white representation and the status of contending armies became feasible . As Clausewitz observed , " War is often nothing more than armed neutrality , a threatening attitude meant to support negotiations . " It is when belligerents pause on the battlefield that scope is given to intelligence , " and gambling for high stakes seems to turn into haggling for small change . " In Rhodesia , the latest pause has been impressively exploited . Plainly , there will be much haggling before Zimbabwe Rhodesia finds its way to multiracial nationhood . But that is beginning to look like small change .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
