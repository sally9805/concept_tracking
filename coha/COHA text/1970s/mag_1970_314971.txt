BEFORE he discovered Sesame Street last year , Associate Editor Stefan Kanfer , like many parents , had little faith in the educational value of television . " My first reaction whenever I saw my kids in front of the set , " he recalls , " was to distract them somehow until I could shut it off . Then I noticed what they were watching , and pretty soon I found I was watching Sesame Street with them . When they peeled off to play from time to time , I was still there watching it . Now I even watch it when the kids are n't home . " <P> Kanfer who wrote this week 's cover story on TV s best children 's program relied for much of his inspiration on Daughter Lilian , 9 , and Son Ethan 6 . " I took them along to the studio for a show , " he says They 'd been to TV shows before , even backstage . They were fairly blas this time , too , until the Muppets came on . Then it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They were enchanted ! " <P> Equally Muppet-struck are Correspondent Mary Cronin and Researcher Patricia Beckert , who did the reporting for the story . Cronin set out to interview the puppeteer who manipulates Garbage-Can Resident Oscar the Grouch , but ended up conducting a canside dialogue with Oscar himself " In your off hours , do you ever talk to any kids ? " she asked him . " Once I met a blind boy and he had heard the show , " Oscar recounted " He felt my hair and I bit him . But I do n't have any teeth so I ca n't hurt anyone . So we shook hands and we talked . Beautiful kid . " Beautiful Grouch Naturally Cronin watches the show whenever she can . As for Beckert she has become so entranced that " I 've been getting up every morning for weeks to watch the show before coming to work . " <P> What is it that makes a children 's program so addictive for adults ? " It takes you back to childhood , " says Cronin . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There are double-entendre puns and jokes but they do n't get in the way of the children 's enjoyment . " Adds Kanfer : " Deep down we 're all culturally disadvantaged . Because there 's not enough irony , humor and liberated nonsense for all us kids . There 's a profound wit that we 've all lost track of since Edward Lear and the Alice books . " <P> Whatever the attraction , Sesame Street 's proven effectiveness in teaching basic skills to youngsters indicates that it will be a favorite of parents for years to come . " I 've learned to count to ten , " says Kanfer , " and I 'm much better at recognizing letters now . " The Cover : Photograph of Sesame Street 's Big Bird by Bill Pierce .
