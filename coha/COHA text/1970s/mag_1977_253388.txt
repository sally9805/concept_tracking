Robert Lowell : 1917-1977 <P> " Ah the swift vanishing of my older/ generation , " Robert Lowell lamented in a sonnet not long ago , " the deaths , suicide , madness/ of Roethke , Berryman , Jarrell and Lowell . " There was a justifiable pride in this facetious reference to himself , for while his contemporaries died early , Lowell seemed to thrive on middle age . He too had been humbled by madness-an experience he documented in Life Studies ( 1959 ) - but had survived to become America 's most distinguished contemporary poet . When Lowell died last week of a heart attack in a New York City taxi at the age of 60 , he was enjoying the acclaim that greeted his last book , Day by Day . <P> Apart from Lord Weary 's Castle , a collection of tortuous , difficult poems that won him the Pulitzer Prize in 1947 , Lowell 's books were devoted to a ceaseless self-scrutiny . The glimpses of his private world could be harrowing . " I hear/ my ill-spirit sob in each blood cell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he confessed in Skunk Hour , a famous testament to his dark inner life . It was an outwardly tempestuous life as well . He was a Roman Catholic convert in his 20s-he later renounced the church - and a conscientious objector who served five months in prison for draft resistance during World War II . In his later years , he suffered from manic-depression and was often in mental institutions . He had three wives , all writers : Novelist Jean Stafford , Critic Elizabeth Hardwick and English Novelist Lady Caroline Blackwood . The Byronic drama of his marriages made its way into Lowell 's poetry , where he quoted his wives ' letters and reproaches , chronicled his infidelities and begged forgiveness . But he portrayed his worldly sorrows with a fervor transcending mere confession . There are , for example , these lacerating lines from " Man and Wife " : <P> you were in your twenties , and I , <P> once hand on glass <P> and heart in mouth , <P> outdrank the Rahvs in the heat <P> of Greenwich Village , fainting at your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pass , <P> while the shrill verve <P> of your invective scorched the traditional South . <P> <P> Now twelve years later , you turn your back . <P> Sleepless , you hold <P> your pillow to your hollows like a child ; <P> your old-fashioned tirade- <P> loving , rapid , merciless- <P> breaks like the Atlantic Ocean on my head . <P> Tall and stooped , at once courtly and disheveled , Lowell presided with a grim conscience over American intellectual life and willingly intervened in politics , appearing in demonstrations against the Viet Nam War and campaigning for Eugene McCarthy . Norman Mailer , in The Armies of the Night , recalled him during the march on the Pentagon in 1967 , " virile and patrician , " with " a Cromwellian light in his eye . "
