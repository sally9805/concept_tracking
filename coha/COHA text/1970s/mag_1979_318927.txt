Kerr-McGee found liable <P> In the wake of Three Mile Island , the battered nuclear power industry suffered another blow last week , this one in a court of law . A federal jury in Oklahoma City handed down a finding in the celebrated case of Karen Silkwood that vastly increased the chances that a company using nuclear materials might have to pay heavy damages for harming not only its employees , but people in surrounding areas . <P> The jury found Kerr-McGee Corp . negligent in the handling of highly radioactive plutonium because it did not protect Silkwood , a lab technician , from contamination . The jury awarded her three children $10.5 million . She herself was killed mysteriously in 1974 when her car ran off a road as she was on her way to give evidence of the plant 's carelessness to a New York Times reporter . <P> During the eleven-week trial , the manner of Silkwood 's death was not an issue .

Asked Spence : " Did she know too much ? " <P> The jury seemed impressed by the testimony of witnesses claiming that Kerr-McGee had carelessly handled radioactive materials . But the decision awarding damages to Silkwood 's heirs went far beyond the simple finding that the company was guilty of negligence .
