My letters are often sold not as literature but as the material relics of a modern saint , wrote George Bernard Shaw to a friend . " Often , some impecunious journalist asks me to refuse his requests for material on an insulting postcard , so that he can dispose of it to a collector for the price of a meal . " That particular letter brought the price of a pretty good meal-$250-at an auction of G.B.S. letters and memorabilia at Manhattan 's Parke-Bernet Galleries . A total of $41,900 was paid for the 165 lots-including $4,250 for a packet of 19 love letters from young Shaw to his " undeservedly beloved , " a nurse named Alice Lockett . " I am , " he wrote , " opinionated , vain , weak , ignorant , lazy and so forth . " He gave her a sample in his final letter : " Lovemaking grows tedious to me-the emotion has evaporated from it . This is your fault . " <P> " None is Fun " is the slogan of NON-the new National Organization for Non-Parents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jim Bouton ( who has had two children and a vasectomy ) and Theater Iconoclast John Simon ( divorced non-father ) . Non-Mother 's Day and Non-Father 's Day will be celebrated on the appropriate days , as will anything that promotes a " child-free life-style . " To that end , Bouton announced the first NON awards : to David and Julie Eisenhower and Congresswoman Shirley and Conrad Chisholm as Child-Free Couples of 1972 , and to Ralph Nader and Gloria Steinem as Single Man and Single Woman of the Year . " Wonder what kind of a kid they 'd produce , " mused Bouton . <P> " Irreconcilable differences " is the term in California divorce law that covers a multitude of marital problems , and pretty , Dutch-born Mieke Tunney , 35 , has used it to sue for dissolution of her 13-year marriage to California 's Democratic Senator John V. Tunney , 37 . In addition to alimony , child support and half the community property , she is asking for custody of their three children . Tunney , claiming surprise , hurried back from California @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , prepared to get along without one of its most glamorous couples . <P> The great Willie Mays-a running , throwing , hitting folk hero in his own time-was back in New York City , and everyone was glad . The San Francisco Giants were glad because their failing gates would no longer have to bear the burden of Willie 's $165,000 salary ( not to mention what they got in exchange : about $100,000 and a pitcher from the New York Mets ) . The Mets were glad because Mays , even at 41 , is still a powerful player as well as an enormous drawing card in the city where he began his career 21 years , 646 home runs and 2,857 big-league games ago . Willie , who has been trying to get a long-term contract to guarantee his future , was delighted . " It 's a wonderful feeling , " he said . " When you come back to New York , it 's like coming back to paradise . "                @ @ @ @ @
