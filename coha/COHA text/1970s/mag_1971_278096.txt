IT is only the latest paradox in the career of Robert McNamara that he turns out to be a chief victim of the Viet Nam study that he initiated . In the documents that have been revealed to date-a partial picture , to be sure - the judgment of the once infallible Defense Secretary seems badly flawed . In the early 1960s , few other Government officials had quite his sense of assurance that escalation would pay off , that a steady application of American pressure and resources would turn the tide of war . <P> Somehow the strategies that won praise for McNamara in his early years as Pentagon chief landed him in deep trouble later . He wanted to escape from the Eisenhower era 's reliance on massive retaliation , so he pursued what was then considered a liberal course . He prepared for conventional war to combat Communism wherever it appeared to threaten American interests . Yet he helped lead the nation into a war of unforeseen magnitude . His business acumen enabled him to gain control of the sprawling Defense establishment . Yet he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the human factors in the Viet Nam conflict . It was a puzzling outcome for a man who had entered Government renowned for his humane instincts as well as his technological brilliance . McNamara became a divided personality . <P> At first his personality seemed monolithic enough . He gave a powerful impression of the assured technician . Even reporters who did not cover the Pentagon liked to attend his press conferences . Briefed to the eyeballs behind his almost rimless glasses , his gleaming black hair immaculately slicked , McNamara delivered an unstoppable stream of convincing detail . He had a swift answer for every question , a sharp rebuttal for every doubt . <P> <P> McNamara overawed the generals and admirals who worked for him , and he barely disguised his contempt for the military way of doing things . His notion of opening a conversation was not " Hello " but " I 've got ten minutes for this one . " And ten minutes it was . The military resented the fact that he and his small band of " Whiz Kids " shunned their advice and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admitted that McNamara 's cost-effectiveness program had brought rationality to much Pentagon planning , but they could not forgive him for never admitting he was wrong . He was once summoned to appear before the House Armed Services Committee to explain why he had ordered the closing of 672 Army bases . Could he have made a mistake in the case of one or two ? asked Representative Edward Hebert . " No , " said McNamara emphatically . Replied an exasperated Hebert : " Six hundred and seventy-two decisions and not a single mistake ? You 're better than Jesus Christ . He had only twelve decisions to make and he blew one of them .
