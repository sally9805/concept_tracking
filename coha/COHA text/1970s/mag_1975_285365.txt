<P> On a gray dawn ten years ago , five U.S. soldiers were killed and twelve wounded during a Communist commando attack on Phuoc Binh , the capital of Phuoc Long province . That marked the Viet Cong 's first offensive against the picturesque hill town of about 25,000 people located 75 miles north of Saigon on a bend of the Song Be River . Last week , after a violent six-day siege of the city , the Communists finally captured Phuoc Binh . During the drive they also took a key crossroads and two airstrips , as well as every village and town in Phuoc Long province ( see map ) . Though the Communists have made considerable territorial gains during the last decade of war , Phuoc Long is the first entire province they have conquered . <P> The Communist offensive began in mid-December , when the North Vietnamese 7th Division overran the district town of Due Phong on Route 14 . Gradually moving southwest , the Communist forces captured a series of government outposts , eventually pushing South Vietnamese troops into the outskirts of Phuoc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vietnamese began a heavy shelling of Phuoc Binh , although they allowed civilians to escape along footpaths to the South . <P> Saigon was unable to provide much help for the 2,500 to 3,000 troops trapped in the besieged city . Because of heavy clouds , South Vietnamese air force planes at first failed to get off preliminary air strikes . Once Saigon did get some A-37 fighter planes into action , the pilots refused to fly below 12,000 ft. out of respect for the Communists ' imposing antiaircraft arsenal . That , in turn , made it impossible for government helicopters carrying reinforcements to land within the city . In the end , the South Vietnamese were only able to put two Ranger companies totaling about 200 men into the battle . After two days of close fighting between outnumbered government troops and Communist tanks and sappers , Phuoc Binh was in North Vietnamese hands . By the time Saigon 's air force belatedly started to bombard the area , destroying what remained of the small lumbering town , the Communist attackers had already withdrawn into their well dug-in and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and several hundred soldiers on both sides are believed to have died in the battle . <P> Ominous Change . Though Phuoc Binh itself is of little strategic importance to Saigon , the ease with which the Communists overran Phuoc Long province was a major psychological defeat . " Its fall showed that the central government in Saigon is quite weak , " conceded one State Department analyst . " A year ago it would have gone in to defend or recover the place . " Equally important , the offensive against Phuoc Long was an indication of an ominous change in the Communists ' overall strategy in South Viet Nam . Since the Paris Accords , the Communists have concentrated on building up their hold on rural areas ; now they seem ready to attack and conquer key administrative centers and major towns . Their apparent goal is to erode the political base of President Nguyen Van Thieu 's Saigon government , forcing it eventually to resign or enter a coalition with the Provisional Revolutionary Government .              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
