txt Letters to the Editor pg . 17 Letters to the Editor Time to ' Recycle ' Abandoned Schools To the Editor : My eight-year-old son recently came home from school saying he had been invited to join the Cub Scouts . I gave him the money and he started to receive Boy 's Life magazine . It is full of ads for firearms and air rifles . On page 12 it 's " ammo you can count on " ( Federal brand hi-power cartridges ) , On page 35 it 's " The gun " and " The son of the gun , " that is , Winchester 30-30 rifles and 22 rifles . Bullets are appealingly pictured to capture the imagination of the small boy who is already feasting his eyes on the firearms . On page 45 there 's the mushroomtype bullet by Winchester ( a murderous killer ) and other bullets , including the Western 22 Rim Fire Cartridge and the Super-X Magnum . The inside front cover is a full-page ad for air rifles , which says boys can learn " what a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tells the young boy that " One good Smith &; Wesson deserves another . " It 's an ad for CO2 rifles , and the boy is urged to say , " Dad , I 'd like a Smith &; Wesson . " Another air rifle is advertised on page 64 . Bows and arrows arc offered on page 10 . Page 52 offers the young boy an opportunity to spend $21.95 for a World War II helmet , apparently a real Nazi type , as well as " Uniforms , Bayonets , On Predicting Birth Defects To the Editor : In a recent letter , Dr. Micheline M. Mathews-Roth uses an argument of the " slippery slope " variety against efforts to predict ( and possibly prevent ) births of babies with grave defects . Giving prospective parents the ability and the right to abort such births does not precipitate us down the slope to a vicious program of " race improvement , " such as Hitler 's , any more than a Social Security tax leads inevitably to Communism , or fluoridation of water supplies to totalitarianism . Insistence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insistence on the absolute sanctity of life can in some instances be cruel . JANICE AURITT OSER Staten Island , N.Y. , July I , 1976 ? Unwelcome ' Soloist ' To the Editor : As the 85th anniversary of Carnegie Hall is being joyously celebrated and as a vigorous fund-raising drive is being undertaken , it is pertinent to point to the unwelcome soloist that never fails to appear in whatever performance is taking place and ruins the glorious sound of the hall : the subway . As Isaac Stern played the adagio of one of Mozart 's violin concertos a few days ago , the roar of a passing train could be clearly perceived , and this is in Long Island City , Queens , was even converted into a community art center , as your June 20 news article illustrated . Earlier this year I introduced two companion measures in the House to help communities convert their unused school buildings to new public and private uses . The first , the Surplus School Conservation Act ( H.R. 12627 ) , makes housing and urban development grants available to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the school buildings into other appropriate public uses . The second measure , the Surplus School Conversion Act ( H.R. 12628 ) , provides a tax incentive for private industry to purchase empty school buildings and develop them as commercial properties . It is time to recognize that our resources are limited and that we can not afford to waste a single element  --  even buildings . In short , it is time to " recycle " our abandoned schools . H. JOHN HEINZ 3D Member of Congress , 18th Dist. , Pa . Washington , July 2 , 1976 etc . " Another company offers a spy pen radio .. The inside rear cover tells the young boy he can have a " Widowmaker Drag Car " if only he will sell boxes of greeting cards . My son has already responded to another ad , which tells him how to turn Christmas into a moneymaking occasion by selling cards . There are lots of ads for other offensive things , including a knife ( page 54 ) described as a " powerful brute .

We do n't need a lot of killing and swashbuckling attitudes in a world which needs builders rather than destroyers . We need civilized persons who want to deal with our real civilian problems . I am truly sorry to learn that this magazine is published by the Boy Scouts of America . I was a Boy Scout as well as a Cub Scout . My father was a scoutmaster and my mother was a den mother . I am sorry to see the parent organization has sold out to commercialism , the profit motive and the very attitudes I want to teach my son to oppose . Apparently the tentacles of the gun lobby have reached even into the Boy Scouts of America . BERNARD LAMMERS Canton , N. Y. , June 27 , 1976 true not only with slow movements but with virtually any kind of tempo or intensity of sound . Many listeners are unaware of this extra noise because of the deep concentration in which they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some sort of peculiar sensitization takes place , and this brings a bitter note of dissatisfaction with the performance because it is known that early or late and more than once the unwelcome soloist is apt to make its appearance . It would be most rewarding to the audiences attending the hall if this noise could be suppressed by providing the building with an adequate acoustic insulation . The technology is undoubtedly available ( if we can go to the moon , we can make Carnegie Hall noise-proof , no question about it ) . The financial means to this end should be sought or allocated . MIGUEL A. CIMA , M.D. Rockville Centre , L. I. , June 23 , 1976 Civilized Big Foot To the Editor : Why are the alleged observers of Big Foot so anxious to stone and kill him ? It seems that Big Foot , who quietly retreats , is the more civilized animal . We need to be alerted to the rights of all other animals . ANABEL PARSHALL Old Greenwich , Conn. , July 1 , 1976 China : Another Option ... To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Barnett , commenting on your June 17 editorial " The China Knot , " advocates de jure breaking relations with the group presently in control of Taiwan so as to " normalize " relations with the People 's Republic of China while at the same time maintaining de facto the same kind of economic , cultural and military relations with Taiwan as before . ( This policy is well-known as the Japanese formula . ) Professor Barnett , a long-time advocate of the " two Chinas " policy , claims that he has now abandoned that policy , which " no longer is a realistic option . " I suggest that his present proposal is actually a continuation of the same " two Chinas " policy under a new and more sophisticated smokescreen . It would perpetuate indefinitely the separation of Taiwan province from People 's China , and in my opinion would not be acceptable to the People 's Republic : The other option , the only realistic one , which neither Professor Barnett , nor The Times , nor the State Department are prepared to accept , is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ control of its province of Taiwan ( both de facto and de lure ) , and for the United States to withdraw its military forces and abrogate its military commitments to Taiwan . Only in this way can the United States improve relations with the onequarter of humanity that constitute the People 's Republic of China . JACK SHULMAN Brooklyn , July 2 , 1976 ? ... And a Weak Thesis To the Editor : Your June 17 editorial on improving American-Chinese relations without abandoning fourteen million Taiwanese and the platform adopted by the Democratic Platform Committee calling for normalizing diplomatic relations with Peking in the context ? of a peaceful resolution of the future of Taiwan are welcome signs that American public opinion has come to realize the existence of the Taiwanese people . This should help formulate a fair solution to the Taiwan " problem . " The thesis advanced by some experts that the United States should hasten toward normalizing relations with Peking lest China change its present foreign policy should Chairman Mao pass from the scene is highly implausible . They seem to suggest that China will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his ailing seal on it . That kind of guarantee is only believable to those people with a certain degree of naivete . The only sensible way toward normalizing our relations with Peking is one that is based on the mutual interests of the two countries . These interests include the long-term peace and stability in the Far East . Denial of the Taiwanese people to have any say concerning their own future is contrary to the promotion of that peace and stability . The United States should insist on respecting the will and the free choice of the Taiwanese people in its negotiations with Peking . For only in so doing can we be consistent with Secretary Kissinger 's condemnation of Chile at the recent O.A.S . meeting on violating human rights and his current efforts in achieving majority rule in Rhodesia . Otherwise , we will be accused of conducting a foreign policy of hypocrisy , simply riding the tide of the world opinion without destination . As we celebrate our nation 's 200 years of liberty and freedom , let us Americans ( native as well as naturalized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ determine their own destiny , too . Ko-Yu LEO Jamaica , N. Y. , June 22 , 1976 To the Editor : On June 19 and 20 , The Times published two news articles about the growing problem of school closings and the unused buildings which result . Thousands of school buildings throughout the country have been abandoned due to decreasing enrollment , population shifts , consolidation and other reasons unrelated to the buildings ' structural condition . In Pennsylvania , 144 schools were closed between September 1974 and September 1975 ; 120 are to close this academic year . In New York State , over 200 schools were closed during the last academic year . Demographic data point to an increase in this trend . A recent study in Providence , RI , predicted that , because of declining enrollment , within ten years Providence would have twice as many schools as it will need . Thus , many school administrators are faced with the problem of closing relatively modern schools which have yet to be paid for . Most abandoned schools are centrally located and could be converted into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disrepair . But financially strapped localities are finding that funds to convert the buildings to other public uses or suitable private uses are nearly impossible to obtain . Yet experience shows it can be done : ? In Ithaca , N. Y. , a school building was recycled into a shopping center , housing for the elderly and private offices . ? In Dayton , Ohio , a 2,200-student high school was converted to a center for manpower training , adult basic education and community recreation . Other cities have converted schools into community health centers or plants for light industry , and a school Gun Ads : The Young Targets ? Sri Lanka : To Set The Record Straight To the Editor : I read with interest the June 15 letter from my compatriot Dr. Buddhadasa Kirthisinghe . His plea for a regional approach and for closer economic cooperation among the countries of the Indian Subcontinent is both cogent and tjmely . However , from a strictly Sri Lanka perspective , I must set the record ? straight on two matters . First , whatever Dr. Kirthisinghe may mean by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ historical fact that the Gamsabhavas ( analogous to the Indian Panchayats ) which flourished in ancient Sri Lanka did ensure popular participation in government at the very village level , which formed the socio-economic basis of the country . More recently , the adoption of the Western-style parliamentary democracy from 1948 onward has seen governments being changed five times by the peaceful exercise of the vote based on adult franchise , with 85 percent of the registered voters actually voting in the general election in 1970 . Secondly , Sri Lanka 's population problem is very much under control as a result of the success of Government and privately sponsored campaigns among a population whose literacy rate is as high as 89 percent . As-a result , the rate of population growth , which in 1963 was ' 2.6 percent , has declined to 1.6 percent in 1975 ? an impressive achievement by any standards . To state , in the light of these internationally accepted figures , that Sri Lanka " suffers from an unchecked population explosion " is an inaccurate presentation of the facts .
