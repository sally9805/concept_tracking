If some poor bloke ever did carry coals to Newcastle , like most visitors he undoubtedly would feel compelled to haul himself right back out of that grim industrial outpost on England 's northeastern frontier . One quick way is to ask directions to the smaller city of Gateshead across the River Tyne . The traditional reply , rendered in the native burr that is as thick as the murk that rolls in off the North Sea , is , " Gan ower the Tyne bridge until ye come to the end . Then ye 'll look roond and ye 'll say to yersel ' , ' This canna be Gateshead . ' But ye 'll be wrang . It is ! " // Or at least it was . Long defamed as " the dirty lane leading to Newcastle , " which is itself as grimy a pot as ever called a kettle black , Gateshead is experiencing a rather remarkable swelling of pride that goes beyond its slum-clearance program . Indeed , late of an evening at the Old Fold Pub near Gateshead Stadium , some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( dark ale ) are moved to declare that the surge in civic morale is nothing short of a " flamin ' miracle . " // Bill Collins , a toolmaker who leads the Gateshead City Council , which governs a population of 100,000 , explains , " I believe it was Dr. Johnson who first referred to the town as a dirty lane and then others took it up . As a boy I remember reading J.B. Priestley 's English Journey and his description of Gateshead as ' nothing better than a huge dingy dormitory . ' And the trouble is , he was right . We 've gone a long way toward cleaning up the muck and filth since then . But , aye , it 's true , the people of Gateshead have never had much to cheer about . Until now , that is , until Brendan Foster . " // Foster , a Gateshead resident for all of his 28 years , is a middle-distance runner who holds the promise of bringing home an Olympic gold medal to a town that for centuries buried its brightest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even an object of derision as he ran along the gray-stained streets and country byways of Gateshead , the sight of Foster in his warmup suit now elicits cries of " Howay , Big Bren ! Ye 're doin ' us prood , lad ! " // Every day , often in a drizzly haze that seems as much a part of the landscape as the tiers of huffing chimneys , Foster runs 15 miles or more to and from his job as the city 's manager of sports and recreation . Hardly an inviting tour , he primes for it each morning with a bracing pot of hot tea shared with his wife Susan at their home , one of a cluster of identical two-family brick houses built on the side of a hill overlooking a vast industrial sprawl called Team Valley Trading Estate . // Jogging out his front door and down an embankment , Foster plunges headlong into " The Gut , " the popular name for the once-swampy valley that has 100 factories spread across a landfill of two million tons of colliery waste . Though Gateshead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abandoned drift mines that wind beneath the city like an ant farm still occasionally give way , claiming a chunk of roadway here or a house or two there . // But Foster pays no heed to the roadside signs warning AREA LIABLE TO SUBSIDENCE . Once in the valley he runs across a bridge spanning a busy stretch of railroad tracks and then pads alongside a four-lane highway roaring with early morning traffic . // Midway on the Coach Road , Foster swings through a massive stone gateway that is posted TRESPASSERS WILL BE PROSECUTED . Trotting up a horse trail , he skirts the ruins of Ravensworth Castle . It was here a few years ago that the Ravensworth gamekeeper , shotgun at the ready , threatened to shoot Foster as a suspected poacher . Now he just waves . // When Foster emerges into the clamor of the Lobley Hill thoroughfare , shopkeepers nod their greetings and motorists toot their hooters . As he dips back down into the valley , he hastens by the Norwood Coking Works with its pyramids of coal and huge black stacks spewing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the intersections , he grinds up a steep grade , winding past a ramshackle row of racing-pigeon crees , past the Motorway Tyre Centre , the Gateshead Crematorium and the Bensham Bingo Club . // Just before the Boilermakers Social Club Ltd. , Foster veers right and goes by a deserted " pit village , " one of the infamous piles of brick flats that once passed as miners ' housing . Then , finally , after pushing himself by the new Gateshead indoor bowling green , he skitters up the front steps of the 19th-century Shipcote Baths , where his office is just a few more weary strides beyond the swimming pool . // What makes Brendan run ? " It 's not a question of the loneliness but the enigma of the long-distance runner , " he said cryptically during an afternoon break for tea . Offering to spice the brew with a " bit of brown sugar " from a bottle of Bell 's Scotch Whiskey , he continued , " I 'm normal in every respect except that I run to work . And without question , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a contest , is n't it ? Here in the northeast you do n't succeed because of your circumstances but in spite of them . " // Foster turned to check the clock on his office wall . " Yes , " he said , " the training is hard work . I do n't particularly enjoy running up those bloody hills in the rain and cold . But you try to forget that . At least until you 're out there racing and trying to stretch it , trying to win . That 's when you remember how hard you worked . That 's when you remember those bloody hills . " Precisely at four o'clock , he stood up and said , " Excuse me , I have to run now . " // So run he does , assured that when it comes to adversity , absence makes the heart grow stronger . Take the coking works , for example . Foster once confessed at an awards banquet that he carries with him a special affection for that smoking monument to lung congestion . Why ? " Because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's much easier to run . " // In 1973 Foster only had to go 250 miles south to London 's Crystal Palace to prove his point . That was the time he staged one of his patented midrace surges to pull away from a dozen rivals in a two-mile invitational and then , all alone , turned it on in the final laps to set a world record of 8:13.8 , one-fifth of a second better than the mark held by Finland 's Lasse Viren. // As for 1974 and the hometown affair that the local press acclaimed the " greatest day in Gateshead sporting history , " well , that was special . For one thing , it was Saturday and the coking works was shut down . For another , it was August and  --  behold !  --  the sun was shining . And most wondrous of all was that Gateshead Stadium , a modest old structure resting in a reclaimed chemical dump down by the river , had a brand-new $300,000 all-weather Tartan track . // The redecorating was the town 's way of saying Howay ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the stadium 's ancient cinder track usually looked as if the dump was making a comeback . Which meant that for all his serious pre-race tune-ups , Foster had to travel to Edinburgh , 90 miles to the north , or to London , the only two cities in Britain that had the new artificial ovals . " We knew we were breeding a champion , " says Council Leader Collins , " so we decided to spend our money on something good . And no doubt about it , the wonder track is the best investment we ever made . " // He and just about everyone else in town were convinced on that August Saturday when , just 10 days after the new track was installed , a class field of runners was imported to challenge Foster over 3,000 meters . The 1974 Gateshead Games drew a sellout crowd of 13,500 , the largest that turned out for a meet in Britain that year . And every last Tynesider , it seemed , began clapping right at the opening gun of the featured race and kept increasing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . // After burning off challenges by Britain 's David Black and the U.S. 's Dick Buerkle , Foster 's face tightened into the knife-in-the-back grimace he always assumes when pulling for home . " With two laps to go , I felt very tired , " he recalls . " I was dead . Finished . Then , suddenly , I heard the crowd . All that noise . And I felt a new man . I knew I could beat the record . " That he did , being timed in 7:35.2 to lower Emiel Puttemans ' world mark by 2.4 seconds . // Like notches in a gunslinger 's six-shooter , Foster 's two world records have inspired a lot of young hotshots to test the quickness of the master . It happens every Tuesday evening when Foster works out at the stadium with his fellow Gateshead Harriers , as rambunctious and footloose a lot as ever came down the straightaway . // In a wonderful sort of way , in fact , all of Gateshead seems to be running amok nowadays . Runners of every description  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agents , everyone from the boss right down to the junior typist  --  join in the lunchtime jogalongs at the stadium or run through the streets or around factory parking lots . Foster , who often leads the organized sessions , preaches , " Jogging is the simplest , most basic form of activity . It exercises the heart , and that 's what running is all about . " // Though Foster provides the inspiration , the longtime Pied Piper of Pedestrianism , as they used to call running in those parts , is Harrier Coach Stan Long . A welder until he joined Foster 's recreation staff 18 months ago , Long has been coaching his boss for a dozen years . He accepts Harrier candidates at age 11 and then runs them until their dependency drops off . // Long says , " I reckon I can teach a runner what I know by the time he 's 18 , and then he 's on his own . He can come to me for advice but he must think for himself . I want the lads to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a man who has weathered 46 winters in Gateshead , Long seems most truly in his element when he is putting his charges through their training hoops . " C'm on , young Murray ! " he cried one evening as he sent off successively faster waves of runners , timing it so that each group had the incentive of trying to catch and surpass the one before . Standing in the infield , Long said , " Doing your laps is more fun  --  go on , Gerald !  --  if you make a game out of it . Going great , Bradley ! Use your arms . Go on , lad . Move up , Alice . Only one lap to go . Go on , Winston ! Smash it ! " // Nearby , Terry Nagel , a TV engineer , and his wife Stephanie , were cheering on their son Stephen , who was running alone on the shadowy perimeter of the track . // " Who knows , " said the father , " Stephen might turn out to be another Brendan Foster . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dollar Man , to come out and train tonight . We could n't keep him away . With the help of that man over there , Stan Long , we figure Stephen might be ready for the Olympics in about 10 years . " As it is , Stephen will have to wait four years until Long takes him under wing . He is seven . // Not surprisingly , the Gateshead Harriers are the national cross-country and road-relay champions . And earlier this year at the European Club championships in Arlon , Belgium , their 13-member contingent won the trophy as the best team on either side of the Channel . // The Harriers will go to any lengths to win races , down to but not including the dashes . Sprinters are as rare in Gateshead as coal miners in Miami Beach . Scotland 's David Jenkins , the British and American 400-meter champion , joined Foster 's recreation department last year , but he is still trying to explain that starting blocks are not toys for tots . And the only local field events anyone can recall are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dropped from the league in 1961 because of a lack of support . // " We just have n't the men to coach field events , " says Gateshead Stadium Manager John Caine , himself a distance runner of national repute . Only half kidding , Foster says , " If we have a pole vaulter , we turn him into a miler . " Conditions more or less dictate it . As Long puts it , " You ca n't throw the hammer in the rain . " // And you ca n't deny custom . " The interest in foot racing stems from the traditional working-class Sunday up here , " Foster says . " You raced your whippets in the morning , played darts at lunch-time and then , after a skinful of beer , watched the local harriers run in the afternoon . People in the northeast know about foot racing . They 'll tell you how 45,000 people went to St. James Park to see Arthur Wint run 20 years ago . " // Stan Long will tell you how John White , the Gateshead Clipper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $300 for defeating a Tonawanda Indian in a 10-mile stakes race in New York City . He will tell you , too , about other old-time whizzes like James Rowan , the British six-mile champion and Gateshead 's own Black Assassin , who died prematurely because he guzzled more postrace beers than his wee 104-pound body could tolerate . And with a pint of shandy ( half beer , half lemonade ) firmly in hand and with only the slightest prompting from Foster , Long will even sing you the Tyneside Anthem , a ditty about going to the races a century ago . // " Thor wer lots o ' lads and lasses there , " Long crooned in his most lilting burr one otherwise drab afternoon , " all wi ' smiling faces .... " He was lunching with Foster at the Wheelhouse Restaurant , a converted ferryboat moored on the Tyne , and after the floor show the talk turned to running and regional determinism. // " It 's all in the mind of the bloke , " Foster said , pushing aside his cheese and onion sandwich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Noting that over the centuries the warring Scots had made far greater inroads in the northwest , he said , " There 's the back-to-the-wall thing . That 's when we northeasterners are most lethal . " // Long added , " I think people in the northeast are naturally determined . It 's part of our heritage here . It has nothing to do with being working-class , just the sort of struggles we 've had in the past . " // Determined is surely the word for Foster . Son of an office worker for British Steel , he is the eldest of six children , a self-described " slow developer " who made his quickest moves at the family dinner table . Though chubby as a boy , he joined the track team at St. Joseph 's Roman Catholic School as a 400-meter man and puffed his way to a second-place finish in the 1963 Durham County championships . " Brendan was good , " recalls George Felton , his coach at St. Joseph 's , " but there were other lads equally as good . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joined the Harriers in 1965 and , he says , " Taking up cross-country really gave me an idea of what I could do . " At first , it was strictly a private vision . Lindsay Dunn remembers competing against his close friend a decade ago . " There were races back then when Brendan would finish miles behind everybody , " he says . " Afterward he 'd always say it was just a matter of time until he started winning . I was n't convinced , but he was . " // In 1969 , while attending Sussex University , Foster had an even tougher time convincing officials that he was worthy of entering the British universities cross-country championship . No matter that he had corrected an iron deficiency that had shown up in a blood test a few months earlier , they plainly did not think he was good enough . // " Eventually , " Foster now recalls , " I looked up the program and saw that the highest competitor 's number was 380 . So I made my own 381 on a piece of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run . ' I did and I finished ninth . And although the officials were n't very pleased , they did select me for the universities team for a match against the combined services and an all-England team . I thought I 'd be last , but midway out I found myself with the leaders and just took off . They never caught me , and it was only after the race , when I realized who I 'd beaten , that I thought I really could be a good runner . " // Good enough to finish fifth in the 1,500 at the 1972 Munich Olympics , and even better when he moved up to the 5,000 and won the 1974 European Championships in Rome . After watching Big Bren on the telly and the way he left Olympic champion Viren for dead with a sparkling 13:17.2 , more than 500 Tynesiders turned out to witness his next training session at Gateshead Stadium in person . // At the time , Foster had just given up his job as a chemistry teacher to head the recreation department , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spent running the two miles from St. Joseph 's School to await the 12:30 klaxon at the boiler factory where Long worked . And for his mentor , who would appear in his overalls , carrying his lunch pail and stopwatch to oversee the midday workouts , the acclaim is , well , a flamin ' miracle . // Just like that , Stan Long of Gateshead , the man whose living room has been a youth center for nearly a quarter of a century , was whisked from his welder 's bench to a podium in Budapest where his lecture at the European coaches ' conference received a long ovation and a special request from the president of the European Athletic Association . " Imagine , " says Long , still lost in the wonder of it all , " Adrian Paulen wanting to shake Stan Long 's hand . " // But what really sent him " over the moon "  --  and Foster 's Olympic prospects soaring  --  was Long 's appointment in February as manager of Britain 's distance runners for the Montreal Games . Long says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ London in 1948 because I just could n't afford to go . I could n't even afford to be in Rome when Brendan won his European championship . Now , well , I 'm just thrilled to bits . " // Foster figures to stay in one piece . A low-key chap with a pulse rate idling at a cool 45 beats per , he contends , " The Olympics is just another race . Treat it any differently and you can be greatly disappointed because anything can happen  --  a pulled muscle , the flu , anything . " He recalls the time when Long , the former walking champion of Durham County , fell prey to an untimely gastrointestinal attack . " They reckon Stan was a good walker but he missed out in the nationals because of too many cucumber sandwiches on the train . " // Nor is Foster short on confidence . In Britain 's dual meet with Russia last year , after he triumphed in the 1,500 with an electrifying finishing kick , he was asked at what point he thought he would win . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . And although Foster insists that " The five 's me event , " he may also compete in the 10,000 in Montreal . Attempting the distance for the first time last summer , Foster not only outdistanced the U.S. 's Frank Shorter , the 1972 Olympic marathon champion , but he also won in the fastest time of the year , 27:45.4. // " Whatever happens in Montreal , " Foster says , " I 'll come back to Gateshead and find I 've still got food to eat , a job to do and my friends . Win or lose , it would be wrong if it was any different . " He feels it would also be wrong for him to accept the $60,000 he was offered to join the pro track circuit . " Running is hard enough , " he says , " without having to do it for a living . " // Foster could do without the hometown pressure as well . In fact , in enlisting a top international field for last year 's Gateshead Games , he inadvertently helped his cause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him in the 5,000 . " It took a lot of the heat off , " Foster claims . " Now people here know I can lose , which is a rather nice spin-off from an unpleasant afternoon . " // All of which he hopes will help ward off other unpleasant happenings such as the time when , out for his morning tour in the pouring rain , he became ill and started retching . Almost immediately , a passing car skidded to a stop , a man jumped out and rushed over and asked Foster for his autograph . // Foster attributes the untamed enthusiasm to deprivation . " People have never had much here , " he says . " Nobody brings great culture here , no theater , not even good soccer . Everything that 's good seems to happen somewhere else . So horizons have been limited . People 's ambitions have been confined . " // Foster has succeeded royally in raising the consciousness level in more ways than one . In February , while he was being invested as a Member of the British @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I hope this does n't interfere with your training . " " No , ma'am , " said Brendan Foster , M.B.E. , " I already ran seven miles in Hyde Park this morning . " // The Queen smiled .
