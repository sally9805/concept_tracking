Tall , thin Thomas Fitzgerald , 19 , a junior at Queens College , stood in the crisp night air on Indian Island , a 50-acre patch of scrub just 50 feet off Long Island 's South Shore . From his neck , in front of his chest , hung a strip of 2-by-4 wood , 20 inches long . On it was scrawled " P.O.W. " Fitzgerald , a member of the St. John 's University Reserve Officers Training Corps program ( Queens College has no ROTC unit ) was trying to get into the corps ' Pershing Rifles fraternity . According to police , he and nine other pledges were taken to the island as part of the fraternity 's initiation rites and told to play the part of war prisoners withholding military secrets . Playing Fitzgerald 's interrogator was James Savino , 21 , a cadet officer in the ROTC unit . Savino emphasized his questions by jabbing a knife into the narrow plaque.Somehow one jab missed the target . The knife plunged through the main artery of Fitzgerald 's heart , killing him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charged with second-degree murder ; ROTC headquarters assigned an inspector-general to investigate the incident ; St. John 's suspended the fraternity pending the outcome of a university inquiry . Even before their full-scale investigations began , both the ROTC and St. John 's disputed the police version that the fatal stabbing stemmed from hazing . One ROTC officer suggested that the Pershing Rifles were simply conducting unauthorized training maneuvers . That theory raised the question of why only the pledges played the roles of P.O.W.s . As for St. John 's , its spokesman noted that hazing was forbidden by the university and New York state law . <P> Straight Alcohol . In fact , hazing that inflicts physical or mental abuse is banned by most universities and colleges and several states . But it still goes on to some degree . There have been other deaths . Last year at the University of Nevada at Reno John Davies died after being forced to drink straight alcohol , whisky , vodka and gin , for more than 24 hours by a fraternity called the Sundowners . In New Jersey in 1974 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fraternity at Monmouth College , suffocated in a " grave " he had been forced to dig for himself on a rainswept beach . <P> Most hazing does not result in death , of course , but if the practice is not always dangerous , it is often demeaning . At Michigan State University hazing was banned by 1950 , but it remains an integral part of initiation rites at several fraternities . Senior Steve Ryckman lost interest in joining the Delta Sigma Phi house last year after he developed a burn on his nose from being forced to rub it along a carpet . " They wanted to see how much they could humiliate you , " he recalls . " It was degrading . " On the Champaign-Urbana campus of the University of Illinois , nearly two-thirds of the 54 fraternity chapters still haze . The more extreme initiation rites range from paddling and " chugalug " contests to sticking fingers up rectums or inserting penises in light sockets .                    @
