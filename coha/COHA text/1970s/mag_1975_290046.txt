" There 's a hum on this street , " says Sandy Dennis , looking down a line of lighted marquees in the heart of Broadway , " a feeling of encouragement that has n't been around for a long , long time . " Dennis is starring in Absurd Person Singular , her first Broadway hit in ten years . Her success , along with the return of several other top actors , marks an unexpected renaissance of Broadway . After years of frustration over a Great White Way beset by urban squalor , rocketing costs and deserting audiences , Broadway is enjoying the kind of lively season that seemed to have disappeared permanently . Grosses have been of record proportions . Advance sales for Bette <P> Midler 's Clams on the Halfshell Revue set a new one-day record ( more than $200,000 ) , and Bob Fosse 's $650,000 musical Chicago has not even come in yet . <P> The excitement is not just box office . This season Broadway has offered something for everyone . Oscar Winner Ellen Burstyn is back in the hit comedy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harris star in In Praise of Love , and Ingrid Bergman is in The Constant Wife . Cleavon Little escaped Mel Brooks ' clutches long enough to run off with the notices in Murray Schisgal 's flip farce All Over Town , and Elizabeth Ashley returned triumphantly in Cat on a Hot Tin Roof . The British sent over a generation of stars , including Alec McCowen and Diana Rigg playing together with the finesse of the Lunts in The Misanthrope , John Wood portraying a rapier-sharp Sherlock Holmes , Anthony Hopkins and Peter Firth in the psychological tour de force Equus . Even Liv Ullmann turned up , though in a disappointing production of A Doll 's House ; her presence gave the season an extra glow . <P> Hottest Ticket . At the end of last season only three plays had even made their money back . Yet this season began with hit after hit . Playwright Neil Simon credits the British invasion with supplying the spark . " I think there are better plays here because of what London sent us the first half of the season . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sooner had Peter Shaffer 's Equus and the Royal Shakespeare Company 's Sherlock Holmes settled in as enduring successes than Americans hit back with All Over Town and what has turned out to be the season 's hottest ticket , Bernard Slade 's exercise in extra-conjugal domesticity , Same Time , Next Year . But the sleepers of the season-indeed , the main reason the season itself was a sleeper-were the revivals . Pirandello 's The Rules of the Game and Congreve 's Love for Love drew enthusiastic audiences ; so did Cat and then Gypsy with Angela Lansbury . It was their success that signaled how theater audiences have changed . <P> Elizabeth Ashley felt it directly . <P> Away from Broadway since 1964 , she remembers audiences " looking as if they were hijacked-at the theater under duress . " But when she opened in Cat , she was stunned . " You could feel the audience breathe-they were moved . " They were also younger than they used to be . Says Producer Hal Prince : " Young people have begun to be exposed to serious regional theater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just sitcoms , has rubbed off . "
