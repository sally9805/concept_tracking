Some landscapes were invented by painters and carry their names . The stone farmhouse on a lavender Provenal hill proclaims Czanne ; the shuttered hotel room with a blue glimpse of sea beyond a curlicued balcony announces Matisse . On a less exalted level , can one drive through rural Pennsylvania and not think of Andrew Wyeth ? It happens in California too , through the work of Richard Diebenkorn . <P> If one has admired Diebenkorn 's paintings of the late ' 50s , like Balcony , 1958 , or View from the Porch , 1959 , one comes to see the coastal suburbs of California in terms of them . Parallels of white curb and bright green lawn , the rising streets and bright evanescent houses , the thickly painted figures with features eroded by light , the sharp eupeptic color-emerald , persimmon , rust , ultramarine : the work was a discovery , a naming . For a time most young painters in the San Francisco Bay Area , where Diebenkorn studied and taught art in the late ' 40s and ' 50s , tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Landscape as Cop-Out . These paintings , central to the so-called West Coast look , were the figurative works of a man who had once been an abstract painter and would become one again ; purist criticism gave them short shrift . Landscape was regarded as the abstractionist 's copout . Diebenkorn 's work was described as abstract expressionism ( the New York style par excellence ) diluted for West Coast palates . If not unserious , at least it was not major . " It was always a putdown for me in the ' 50s , " recalls Diebenkorn , 55 , a big , reticent man with a no-nonsense bearing . " There were , one was told , all the New York artists doing strictly abstract painting ; but according to Art News I was nothing but a landscapist . I resented being cut out from the rest , some of whom were as much or as little landscapists as myself . " <P> No fear of that now . Diebenkorn 's retrospective of more than 130 works , originally organized by the Albright-Knox Art Gallery in Buffalo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as masterly a demonstration of a sensibility in growth as any living painter could set forth . He is not , as the condescending tag once read , a California artist , but a world figure . He is not an avant-gardist either , and his work keeps alluding to its sources : the color to Bonnard and Matisse , the strong , fractionally unstable drawing to Mondrian and Matisse again . Diebenkorn 's best paintings mediate between the moral duty to acknowledge the ancestor and the desire to claim one 's own experience as unique , unrepeatable . In short , he is a thoroughly traditional artist , for whose work the words " high seriousness " might have been invented . <P> <P> The curious thing is that , in hind sight , the once criticized swings between abstract and figurative in Diebenkorn 's work seem not to matter . Beyond them , one sees the profound consistency with which he has pursued his essential lan guage as a painter - how the zigzagging pipes under the basin in Corner of Studio - Sink , 1963 , relate to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ landscapes , and are exquisitely refined in the later Ocean Parks ; how the vitreous transparencies of his Californian rooms in the late ' 50s , gridded by mul lions and tabletops , become the sharp glazed intercuts of Ocean Park No. 83,1975.
