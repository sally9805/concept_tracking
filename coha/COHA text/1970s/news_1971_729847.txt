txt For three weeks the youngsters had painted , hammered , sawed , and drilled . Now they were putting the finishing touches to their handiwork . Each of the 15 sixth-graders bent with pride over the object he or she had fashioned  --  a crude abacus . The forerunner of the modern adding machine ? in this instance , rectangular frames fitted out with wooden counters ? could have been purchased for a dollar or so in the city . But that would have spoiled the whole thing . Using the abacus will be important to this math class . But not as important as the making of it . To one member of the class , Danny Knight , the project " put fun into math . " Asked about the program , a school staffer responded with an explosive " WOW ! " He was expressing his unbounded enthusiasm for the experimental plan . But he was also identifying the program , for WOW is the acronym for World of Work . Garry Mandell , coordinator for WOW in the Contoocook Valley Regional School District @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new approach makes education more meaningful and valuable to youngsters . ? When Danny Knight talks about " fun " in working with his hands , Mr. Mandell sees a child motivated to learn and started on the road toward career training . The Contoocook program gradually prepares students for the world of work . It runs through the curriculum from Grade 1 to 12 . In the later years , the program introduces students to career possibilities and updated vocational training . But it is at the elementary level that WOW is revolutionary . " We are breaking down the boxes of English , math , science , and so on , " Mr. Mandell explains . " This means restructuring the curriculum . Each subject now becomes part of vocational education instead of an entity of its own . " Thus a science class spends some time building bird feeders , a history class makes simple " shields " when studying about the Crusades . And all pupils , from first grade on , visit a cider mill , bakery , dairy , and post office . They also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or less complicated operations according to the age of viewers . Handling tools is vital in this training , Mr. Mandell declares . Manipulative skills are basic to an educator and fun to Danny . Federal funding Bringing tools into the classroom has been simplified in the Contoocook area by resource teacher Russ Haviland . Mr. Haviland designed a tool cabinet on wheels . In use , the sides drop down to make work benches , with tools on pegs above ; gut of use , it all folds up compactly for rolling into a corner . Approaches similar to the one in Contoo:ook are being used in other communities Across the United States : Hackensack , I.J. ; Pontiac , Mich. ; Atlanta ; Los Angeles ; Tefferson County , Colo. ; and Mesa , Ariz. , imong others . All are funded by the U.S. Office of Edumtion to develop model programs that can ) e applied elsewhere . Part of the rationale behind this venture s that for too long students have been . eparated according to college potentialvith preference in curriculum and status ; oing to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been increasingly frowned upon ty society . College is often viewed as the oute to avoiding dirt under the fingernails . // *Tooling u the very you // Many school officials are concerned that . although half of high-school graduates go on to college , only 20 percent of American youths earn degrees : They ask : Should public schools be geared largely to the needs of one-fifth of their students ? Yet career education in the elementary grades and higher is not antiintellectual . It is not designed to turn students against college . Rather , the program is viewed as aiding the college-bound , as well as the terminal student , helping both to make intelligent career choices . U.S. Commissioner of Education Sidney P. Marland Jr . argues that " every student leaving school should possess the skills necessary to give him a start in making a livelihood for himself and his family , even if he leaves before completing high school . " And that 's where WOW and other career-education projects cut in ? exposing students to the range of career opportunities available to them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and interests , providing training appropriate to their abilities and ambitions . Danny may not yet be thinking about his adult role in the world , but WOW is gradually nudging him in that direction .
