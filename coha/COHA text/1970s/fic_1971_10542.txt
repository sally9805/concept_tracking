, glossy finish photographs in series of fives in my lap , all of which Harry apparently had said he 'd bought in London , I rememberedvaguely . Beside me on the low Louis Treize table was an even greater flock of them which I apparently had already been through ; and beside these was a stack of Olympia Press and Ophelia Press books I must have looked at too . All of this is crystal clear . The photos were of varied subjects , but most of them were of two women making love in various ways . Some of them were of white girls committing fellatio upon young Negro males . The girls changed from series to series . " That 's the trend it 's taking , " Harry was saying beside me from over my shoulder . " More and more . Lesbianism . Or not even true lesbianism . Just two women , two normal women , making love together . I do n't know why it turns me on so , but it does . " Then I disappeared again . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in its glass-doored shelves . I was aware dimly that he had been talking about " his Fantasy " . He himself had capitalized the word with his voice , and it had something to do with making love with two women at the same time , instead of the normal , usual one . " You would n't believe it , " he growled over his shoulder , as he turned the key on the last great batch of the pornography . " But it 's the God 's truth . " Apparently he had just been talking about something else , too . " If I did n't lock them up , they 'd disappear in a minute . That 's why I had the doors put on . Why , I 've had producers and directors staying up here working on a script with me , big important men I mean , and making plenty of their own money . Well , by God , after they 'd leave , I 'd find one or two of my choicest items missing . Stolen . " He put the keys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different ring from his other keys . All of this was crystal clear , too . " I do n't know why it is . But pornography just is considered fair game . By everybody . An honest man that you could leave all sorts of money lying around in front of , and just let him loose around your pornography ! " Harry said . Then he was suddenly sitting in the black chair talking again , without having walked there or sat down in it  --  just as if some film cutter in a studio working in front of a Moviola had expertly clipped that unnecessary footage out of the scene . Harry was talking about his Fantasy again.  | " And that 's it . That 's what it is : Me and two women in the same bed together , as you may have surmised by now . " Surmised ? I peered at him owlishly . I was incapable of surmising anything . Harry was leaning forward pouring again , first his glass , then mine . This was clearly not the same bottle . Feebly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ failed . " Me and two women , doing everything to each other , to the other two , and all of us watching it all with great relish and the greatest of pleasure . " Are you listening to me ? " I remember the first time  --  First ?  --  the only time I ever had it . One spring day I drove through the pass and over into the Burbank area . It was flat , for miles before you got to the actual city . There used to be lots of massage parlors over there , back then , where you could get laid for anything from ten dollars up to fifty dollars , depending upon what exactly you wanted . I was a pretty big shot then , and not married . I picked out this slender young girl with nice boobs , one of the three who worked there . Slim young thing . She had sneaky eyes and she looked me over closely , a real scrutiny , and then asked me privately if I 'd like for her to bring her friend with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we did just about everything three people can do together , I guess . I 've never had another scene like it . " I went back there later , and saw my girl again , but her friend had left . I asked her about our scene , and she said sure , and she got another girl . But it was n't the same . The two of them were just putting on an act for me , the second time . I suppose my girl did n't want this other strange girl to find out she really liked it . I learned one thing . The women have to like it , or it 's no good . " I 've known women since then that I thought might like that kind of action . Some of them , when I was making it with them , I was sure had been making it with other girls . But I could never quite get my nerve up enough to ask them . And none of them ever asked me . " So that 's the one time I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ haunts me . " I tell you , Jack , there 's nothing like lying there watching two women go down on each other while one of them is gently jacking your cock . Or one of them sucking the other , while you 're fucking the one.  | " But I think it takes a special kind of woman . She has to like men too . " Oh , I know it 's just a fantasy . For a man in my position now , married , and with a wife and all , and a family . It 's like one of those fantasies you have about taking your wife to one of those undressing orgy places , like Olga 's , where you take off all your clothes before you even go into the bar . You imagine it , but you would never do it . It would hurt too much . If it was your wife . You ca n't do those things with a woman you really love . " Oh , I know all about fantasy . Enough to know that when you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to cause mayhem . Or murder .. .  --  or else they 'll just be ridiculous . " He moved then , and stretched his muscles stiffened by sitting immobile too tensely too long , and I realized in my befogged , dimly apprehending way , suddenly , that he had not moved at all in a long time . " I do n't know what got me onto all of this .  --  ? Oh , yes . See , I know it 's only a Fantasy . But it haunts me . Haunts me like some haunting melody . Maybe because I only had it that one time . But why should it affect me so ? Well , see , I think it has something to do with that male masochism I was talking about earlier when we  --  . " . . . It was exactly as if a black curtain had descended between us , cutting off the play in the middle of the second scene of the third act . I had departed again . Later I found myself out in the street , weaving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stand up erect and straight , in case any police or youthful muggers after my gold wristwatch passed by . But when I stood straight , I found I had a tendency to lean too far over backwards . When I corrected for this and leaned forward again , I would almost fall on my face . The chill A.M. air tasted good , but did not aid me . I had only to make it from the end of the Island up past the darkened deserted Brasserie and the rue Jean-du-Bellay , past the rue Boutarel to the rue le Regrattier . That was n't far . I could remember dimly something about Harry offering me the big couch in his living room , but I had refused . I did not want McKenna , or even Hill , to see me there in the morning , when they got up to go to school . I kept one hand pressed firmly to the top of the stone parapet that lined the quai'sp59sidewalk to keep people like myself from falling to the lower level and cracking their skulls . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overcoat , I 'm sure , hunched up messily across the back of my neck . In the morning I found I had pressed the parapet so firmly that the skin of the fingertips of my one hand looked successfully sandpapered . But mainly I was worried about Harry . I was terribly afraid he would never want to see me again , after all he 'd said . I knew I would n't , were I he . And after all , I was McKenna 's Godfather . But I need n't have steamed up . Not with Harry . Not only did he call me at one the next afternoon , but he invited me to a late lunch at Lipp 's that same day . There we ran into both Mary McCarthy and Romain Gary , both looking too terribly bright and chipper , though at separate tables , of course . Harry said hello to them both.  |p61I  AM CONVINCED THAT had the weather not held good through most of May , there would have been no Revolution . There might have been a few flurries . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ **26;12642;TOOLONG more than just about any other thing . I know that sounds cynical . But I believe it 's true , and so did the Paris police believe it . I understand the officials at the Prefecture gathered every day at noon to study the daily weather projections . But the weather did hold . Day after day the sweeter , less violent European sun rose to a nearly cloudless sky , pouring its unexpected bonus of warmth down upon cobblestone and leafing tree , demonstratorand cop alike , calling us all to come outdoors : warming even the gray Paris stone , which even in 1968 was still permeated with medieval damp and chill . Such weather was an almost phenomenal thing in Paris in May . And day after day officials scanned the reports , and the sky itself , for the rainclouds that ought to be coming along , but did n't . Hill Gallagher came by to see me on the Saturday of May 4th , the clay after the closing of the Sorbonne by the Rector , one M. Roche . Beams of sun were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the quai sent up a constant murmur of pleased voices . Hill had four of his student friends with him : three boys , and one girl.  |p62The  first thing I noticed about Hill was that he had a beauty of a black eye . The second thing I noticed was that he was  --  they all were  --  dressed in what was soon to become the uniform of the Revolution : blue jeans , flannel shirt , running shoes ( i.e. , tennis shoes ) , and a large bandanna knotted loosely around the throat . There had been rioting into the night by the students the night before . And I had sat at my desk pretending to work , and watched the clouds of gas and smoke rising in the glare of light from the Latin Quarter across the river , and had listened to the two-toned French sirens hooting across the night : and the dim shouts and chants of the students and the soft plops of the tear-gas grenades exploding . The morning papers had stated that 496 arrests had been made by the police , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , five of them , in my living room  --  one of them a girl . And I soon learned that that girl was not to be discounted . She would have made a saint angry . Hill had come up first alone . In all my dealings with the students and their Revolution I have never known one of them not to be absolutely polite , thoughtful and respectful to me when I was with him . " Listen , I 've got a couple of buddies with me , " he said when we had said hello and I had commented on his eye . " They 're waiting downstairs . Would you mind if I invited them up ? And offered them a drink ? " " Absolutely not , " I said . " I 'd like to meet them . " " It 's perfectly all right if you do mind , " he smiled . " No , no ! Ask them up . " We walked to a window and he leaned out and whistled down to what appeared to be four long-haired boys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stone of the quai above the river . He waved down to them on the crowded sidewalk and motioned them up . It was not until they were inside my living room that I realized one was a girl . It was hard to tell at a distance , with them all dressed alike , because of the long hair . And she had almost no boobs at all . What little she had , along with the not-negligible swell of female hip in the tight jeans , was hidden by an imitation American Indian 's buckskin jacket complete with fringe , but made of suede . They were absolutely handsome kids . Anyone should have been proud to be their parents . Since they were all French and had littlep63English , we spoke mostly in French . Hill had let his own sideburns and hair grow out some , although he had n't grown a beard . But these boys ' hair hung literally to their shoulders . One of them was bearded . If anything , the girl 's bobbed hair was a little shorter than theirs . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had the most beautiful head of hair I 've ever seen on anyone . Any woman would have given her eyeteeth to have his hair . Parted in the center , it fell in tight natural waves all the way to his shirt shoulders . And below it was the most innocent , sweet , open , trusting face imaginable . I gathered his name was Terri . The bearded one , though perhaps less striking , was no less handsome : with his full , pointed black beard and the intelligent , sensitive eyes peering out at you from above it . What the hell ? I found myself wondering to myself . What was so unmanly about long hair ? Hell , in the eighteenth century you would have called a dandy 's long hair unmanly at your direst peril . I hustled around to make them drinks , trying to show them my feeling for Hill included them . It was easy to see that a Scotch " un ze rucks " , which was what they all asked for , was quite a treat for them at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explain how much and why the Sorbonne means what it does to the students of France . It is only one of five autonomous colleges of the University of Paris . Yet it is the spiritual and symbolic head of all the universities of France . Probably just its history alone accounts for a lot of this . It was founded in the thirteenth century , and dedicated to those elite problems of the age : religion and politics . Throughout the Middle Ages it attracted the greatest scholars of Europe . St. Thomas Aquinas was one of its great masters . Latin was its language then , and its men played very important roles in nearly every big intellectual question of the age  --  such as how many angels can stand on the head of a pin . As the big religious problems of that period faded under the pressures of time and living , philosophy naturallymoved in to replace these and became the Sorbonne 's almost exclusive province . Always its students , and usually its teachers , stood for freedom of expression , freedom of the right to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the worst part of the French Revolution , it had been re-opened by Napoleon in i8o8 with a series of sweeping educational reforms  --  and it had changed almost not at all since then . But to French students it remained the holy of holies of the true French education , and in all that time it had remained the students ' private preserve and sanctuary against their hereditary enemies of the status quo : the police . An old law dating almost from the school 's inception 700 years before stated expressly that on-duty policemen could not enter the students ' revered Sorbonne without the particular invitation of the Rector . However antiquated and quaintly medieval all this might sound to an American system in the first miseries of a World Technological Revolution , it meant a lot to the French kids . And that M. Roche their Rector could utilize this old rule as a Government ploy to call in the cops  --  and without even letting them know he had done so  --  that was the greatest betrayal and insult he could have handed his Sorbonnestudents . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had presented a somewhat garbled , **29;12670;TOOLONG stating there had been a fight , or nearfight , in the building 's courtyard : between the Leftist students holding a meeting and a Rightist student group calling itself the Occident . This fight , the Government said , had forced the Rector to ask the police to intervene . But young Hill with his bruised face told me quite a different story . Hill 's ran this way : Young Dany Cohn-Bendit ( There was that kid again. ) had been making his first speech at the Sorbonne , hoping to get converts for his 22nd of March Movement . His Nanterre group wanted to boycott year's-end exams until the Government agreed to their proposed reforms . Rumors that could never be traced ran around the meeting saying the Occident boys planned to attack the courtyard and break up the meeting . So a student group posted itself at the entrances to the yard armed with sticks and old table legs . What appeared however was not the Occident but a line of police who filed in and lined up along the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , their heavy protective fighting raincoats and carrying the long light hardwood riot sticks . Then , and only then , the students were informed the Rector had called for the police . They were ordered to leave quietly . The implication was that if they ( lid , they would not bep65bothered . So their leaders urged them to go peacefully . But when they did , they found all the entrances to the Sorbonne tightly cordoned off by riot police out in the street , backed up by their " Black Marias " . The students had walked out into a trap where they could be arrested singly or in twos and threes . This was the first establishment of a pattern which the police , and the Government itself , would use on the students during the rest of the troubles :  --  a pattern of dissimulation , false promises , and downrightlies to gain their ends . In this case the end was the arrest of the Leftist students . The riot police began carting them off by the vanloads . " And that was when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grin . " There were plenty of us in the area still , and we began to drift back and jeer the police , when we found out what was really happening . They charged us and started throwing their gas grenades . We retreated to the Boul ' Mich ' and started throwing up barricades . But they had every side street occupied in advance , and closed in from all sides . That 's how they caught so many of us . We 'll know better next time . We 'll have our lines of withdrawal planned . That was our baptism of fire . " I could n't help noticing the military usage . I sympathized with their anger at the dishonesty of the Government and its police . But the military usages irritated me . I was an old soldier myself , though maybe not on Harry 's level . I did n't like military usages . Hill had been at the meeting , it turned out as he went on , but had left early because Red-Headed Dany had reached that part of his speech where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repeating himself . So had some of the others in the know , and that was why they had not been caught in the first net . That comment irritated me further . I had heard too many ambitiouspoliticians talk about the values of oratory on the ignorant populace . But I did n't want to make an argument with Hill . I seized on Red Dany . Did Hill know Dany le Rouge ? No , he did n't really know him , he had only met him a few times briefly , and had talked to him : and he agreed with everything he stood for and believed . Well , how come he had left , then , during his speech ? Well , you had to understand , he explained , that not all students ,  |p66just  because they were students , were equally smart , or sensitive . Percentage-wise , statistically , intelligent students ( on their somewhat higher levels ) were just as rare , just as small in number as intelligent workers or intelligent bourgeois were on theirs . And the latter part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mass of the lessawarestudents , which was where the needed power lay . So there was no reason for the ones in the know to hang around . Dany and his boys all understood that . I found it hard to believe he was telling me this in all innocence , as it appeared . But was n't that sort of  --  cynical ? I asked . But yes ! he said in French ; certainly yes . Shit , yes ! How would you think that my General makes it so well ? Okay , I thought : I stopped right there . But Hill must have caught some look he did n't like that flashed across my face , because he looked disturbed and went back to it : on the other hand it was not cynical at all because they were only saying what they truly believed , and what the other students when they understood it and felt it , would also realize was the truth . I did not pursue this sophism . I easily could have , but I did n't want to or feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But as a matter of fact I would not have been allowed to pursue it , anyway . Because this was where the little girl Hill had brought stepped in . " Would you not , then , allow us the same rights to orate , to rhetoricize , to propagandate the populace that you allow of the Government ? " she demanded in a cold voice . " Is that of fairness to you ? " " I would allow you anything , " I said , and made her a little bow . Something about her way of speech forced me to . That girl instantly inflamed me . " Or rather , anything you can TAKE and KEEP . But that has nothing to do with moral right . Dialectically , you have no moral right at all . So I find it droll that you resort to the same bad methods which you hate and attack the Government for using . " " Because to us they do not permit some choice ! " she said flatly . " They make us to make it ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I smiled . That was one of their big bitches , already . " Will you not become as rotten as they , then , in the end ? If you use their methods ? " " Not we ! " the little girl declared with a cold contempt . " Because wep67are right ! And you know it ! We love . And we have only the good in our heart . " She infuriated me . " You say so . It has not been proved to me , " I smiled . " And if it were proved for this week and this group , it would not be proved for next week and some other group . " " But that is sophistry . Is it not bad that  --  " she began . Then she stopped . It was as if some invisible signal had gone round the room : I was one of them : one of the old ones : I would never understand . None of the old ones would . Why bother ? In the new silence not one of the five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say something ; and they all five simply stood , smiling pleasantly at me . " Excuse me , " I said . " I 'm sorry . " And I guess I was . But that little girl just automatically ignited me . It had nothing to do with being an old one . It had to do with her absolute righteousness . She had a builtininability , that girl , even to conceive  --  let alone admit  --  that she might ever , once , one time , be even four per cent wrong . She looked at me the way some Communists did . She was the teacher and I was the pupil . She had awarded herself total moral superiority . Not only must I come to class , but I must learn my lesson , or she would smack my ! lands with her ruler . Physically , she was a tiny little thing really . A blonde French , with arms like sticks , and nearly stick-like legs , a neck I could put one hand around almost ; and out of that pale , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of pale-blue eyes peered at me with a total , contemptuous , fierce belief . I was n't being political . I had seen Americans look at me that same way : some Liberals , some redneck reactionaries . In fact , I had seen her type often . She was one of those who even if they made a public declaration that they were three-and-three-quarters per cent wrong about some thing , it would only be to prove to themselves and to the world how absolutely good and right they loo per cent were . " Let me get all of you another drink , " I smiled at her  --  though it hurt my face . " The same ? Scotch on the rocks ? " " With intense pleasure , " she smiled back . The others , the boys , all nodded , still smiling , that they would like the same again . It was a thing , an attitude , I would come up against again amongst the students , all during the rest of the Revolution . But I did n't knowp68that then . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to admit they might be right ; but that was not enough . In any case Hill had been sitting in one of those student-haunt cafes on the Place Sorbonne when the arrests began , he went on , and had helped lead in the jeering , and in the retreat to the Boulevard St.-Michel . He laughed happily , suddenly . " I got hit later on in the ' " evening , with one of those long hardwood clubs . But I managed to get away . A lot of us did . But I know by God we dented a few of their damned heads . " My thing with the girl appeared completely forgotten . For our own reasons , we all saw fit to drop it completely . I went around with the ice and the bottle . Hill went on with his story of the night . " Excuse us , please . We have a thing to talk , " Hill said in French after they all had their second drink , and motioned to me toward the kitchen . From their faces as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least something about why he was there : none was surprised . Out there , I looked again at the ugly mark on his face . Seen more closely , it was not a black eye at all . He had taken a horizontal smash along the ridge of the cheekbone . A blue and yellow tear-shaped splotch tailed back toward his ear , and dark venous blood from it had seeped over into the hollow under the eye . " I 've got a nice big chunk of beefsteak you can put on that if you want , " I said . " They say that helps . " I tried a joke . " I can always cook it later just the same anyway . " Hill brushed all this aside . " No , no . That 's not important . I 'll get worse than that before I 'm through with this . That 's not what I came for . " It turned out none of the previous discussion was what he had come for . He had come to speak to me about his father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you see , this thing 's a long way from over . We 're just not going to let it drop . A lot depends on what the judges do with our innocent comrades that 've been arrested . We 're almost certain they wo n't release all of them . But even if they do , we 're not letting it drop . We 're calling a big protest demonstration for Monday the 6th . They 've made a terrible tactical blunder . They 've called police into the Sorbonne ; M. Roche has closed the entire college until further notice ; they 've beaten up and arrested hundreds of innocent students.  |p69They  've made an awful blunder , and we are going to exploit it . We 'll have every damned student all over France out in the streets on strike ! " He was very excited , and his eyes were snapping above his happy grin . I on the other hand could not help but remark his blatantly propaganda usage of the word " innocent " . He went on . " There 'll almost certainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the big demonstration . " He actually said " Manif " , instead of " Demonstration " , which is the argot short form for the proper French word " Manifestation " . In France , in order to have a public Manifestation , any group must first ask for and get express permission from the police . Hill was sure this permission would be refused . " Which will only make it that much better . Because we 'll have so many people out there they wo n't be able to stop us . " " But what has your father got to do with all of this ? " I asked . " Oh . Well . " Well , I did n't get home last night . What with all the meetings and all . And I do n't expect to get home tonight , either . In fact , I do n't really anticipate getting home again for quite some time , now that this has happened . " He looked at me anxiously . " Yes ? " I said . I realized , quite suddenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as his father was . He seemed to be leaning down over me . " I want you to tell dad that for me , " he said . " So he wo n't worry . lust go and see him and tell him you saw me , that I 'm okay , but that I 'll not be coming home for a while . So he should n't expect me . Do n't tell him about the eye . " I nodded . But I felt I ought to say something . " Well , where will you Iw staying , Hill ? " " Oh , we 've got access to a couple of lofts where we 're holding our meetings , and sleeping , when we have to sleep . " " What about your clothes ? And all that . " " We 'll wash them . None of that matters . I 'll tell you a little secret . We expect to be holding our meetings and doing our washing in the Sol bonne itself . Before very long . " Aml we 'll throw it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ workers , Government officials , everybody . Everybody will be weltonu ' ! " He coughed , to contain  --  and to hide  --  his emotion . " But do n't tell my clad that . Just tell him what I told you to tell him . "  | " But I think you should go and tell him all this yourself , " I said . Suddenly his shoulders came up towards his ears , and he looked at the floor . It was not so much a shrug , as it was that same look of dejection I had seen on him that night at their house : head down , shoulders up , his over-big , pup-like paws dangling at the ends of his long arms . " Aw , you know I ca n't talk to him . He wo n't listen to me . I could talk till I 'm blue . He filters everything through those **26;12701;TOOLONG ideas of his ; and comes out believing exactly what he wanted to believe anyway . If I go try to talk to him , it will only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pull rank , and forbid me to go out with the comrades . And then I 'll have to tell him to go screw , and go anyway . He does n't know I 'm grown up enough to decide  --  and have been for quite some time now . He wo n't admit it . " He looked up at me then . " I do n't want to see him . " It had a stubborn , unmovable finality . " What 's your mother going to feel about all this ? " I said as gently as I could . I was beginning to get irritated again . Hill swung his gaze back onto me , and his eyes flashed dangerously . " What do I care what she thinks ! Or feels ! Especially her ! Both of them ! With their phony parenthood , and all that family Togetherness crap they try to sell so hard but do n't live up to ! " " All right , all right , " I said soothingly . I could see I was n't going to change his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll tell him exactly what you want me to . But I want you to know that I think you 're absolutely wrong about your father .

We all know that , Jack . " Besides , you do n't know everything that goes on all the time everywhere , " he added with a dark look . " You 're pretty innocent , at least about your friends . " I did not know what he meant by this last . Also , it was the first time he had ever called me " Jack "  --  at least it was the first time that I could remember  --  instead of " Uncle Jack " , or " Mr. Hartley " . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trial balloon . I slapped him on the back.  | " All right , I 'll talk to him , " I said . " I 'll go down there this evening . And I 'll lay your case out to him exactly as you 've told it to me . Whether you believe it or not , I 'm sure he 'll understand . " Hill grinned at me . " Thanks . " " Now you tell me something , " I said . " Tell me , is that little girl ?  --  What 's her name ? " " Anne-Marie ? " " Anne-Marie . Is she your girlfriend ? " Whether it was my accepting him on a first-name basis , or simply what I said about talking to his father , he had changed suddenly from the unhappy , misunderstood son back into the excited grinning studentRevolutionary . And now he changed again , just as suddenly . His eyes got funny , and faraway-looking . " Girlfriend ? " he said . " You mean lover . " " Well , " I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoulders came up to his ears again , and he sort of spread his hands . " Well , she 's . . . she . . . " Abruptly , for all the world like some adult switching to protect the supposed innocence of some child , he switched to French . " Elle nous fait des pipes az tous les quatre . Elle now fait des pompiers . " I almost shouted . " What ! " I was half badly shocked , and half laughing . " She goes down on the four of us . She blows us all , " Hill said in English . " You mean she . . . " I began . " All at the same . . . I mean , all in the same . . . " Hill 's brows came together in a mildly irritated frown . " No , no . No , no . We 're not orgiasts .

We have been assigned a  --  a certain area of exploration , shall we say . " " And she , Anne-Marie , is a member of the . . . " I said . " But she does n't like to . . . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hill said , frowning . " She knows about the pill ? " " Oh , sure : she knows about the pill . Look . See , she does n't have to do anything at all . Anywhere . I mean , she 's not required to . . . I do n't think you understand . " " Oh , I understand , " I said . " Of course , I understand , that . " I tried to smother my silly grin . " But , did you really feel you had to go into French to tell me that ? " " Well . I do n't think you really understand how things are with us : our generation , " Hill said . He grinned a little bit himself , now . " I mean . . . " " Of course , " I said . " And perhaps not . I am older . But , my God , Hill , I 'm not that much older ! To lapse into French with me , as if you were speaking in front of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phrase in French , " he said , defensively . " It 's a cute phrase . " " Descriptive , " I nodded . " It is pretty . It 's a pretty , and descriptive , phrase in English , too . " I was suddenly reminded of the current American-English joke about the young man explaining to his fiancee that " blow " was just a figure of speech , and almost collapsed . I wanted to let out a roar and laugh out loud , but restrained myself . " I do n't really think you really understand how it is with us , Uncle Jack , " Hill said , peering at me with a frown again . " We 're a sort of a  --  of a family , really . " I do n't think you understand . " I caught that return to Uncle Jack . " Sure I do , " I said . " Of course I do . You 're all on the same committee  --  sub-committee . And AnneMarieis the only girl on the sub-committee . And she feels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No , no ! " Hill said . " She likes us all . It just happens that we 're all on the same sub-committee . " " Of course , " I said . " I understand that . I 'm really not as old as youp73think , Hill . I mean , it 's not like as if I were your grandfather . I think we ought to get back out to your guests , in any case . "  --  " Hill reacted , but did n't answer . " My God , did n't you ever read a copy of my Review ! " I could n't resist crying . " Yeah ; it 's pretty hip , " he said from the door . They were all still standing , or sitting , just exactly as we had left them , in exactly the same positions exactly , as if , when I disappeared from view , they had immediately and at once frozen themselves in the postures they had had , so that , when I eventually and inevitably returned , I would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been nosing around or poking into any of my things , or peering at anything . I could not help thinking that , even for French politeness  --  and the French set a great store by politeness , more than Americans do  --  this was going a bit too far . " Well , kids , " I said , " what about one more drink ! " I went around with the bottle . I could not get rid , whenever I glanced at her , of a sort of imaginative picture like a film clip doubleimageof Anne-Marie standing like a sergeant before her four ranked boys , all standing at attention with large erections projecting from their Revolutionary uniforms , and her going down the line like a good Commissar , or dutiful Den Mother , doing each in turn so that he could keep his mind where it ought to be on the Revolutionary business at hand and stop thinking about his crotch . Therapeutic service . I kept having to blink . And around me , they all sat and talked together easily , about the Revolution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glance at Hill . They were clearly all working together , it came out as they all talked , on the formation of this Committee having something or other to do with Cinema . But mostly they talked about what would be the fate of their comrades who had been arrested the day before . No word had been heard about them yet , and they were still locked up . The big tlut'stion of the moment was whether they would all be freed or not . None of Hill 's gang thought that they would all be freed ; and all was what the students were demanding . As they left , hill said to me in English in a low voice , " Do n't forget what we talked about , about home ? " I nodded and winked and , after they had gone , went to the windowp74to watch them walking together arm in arm , two in front and three behind , down the quai toward the old Bailey bridge footbridge that crosses over to the rear of Notre-Dame . I watched them swing along through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in my throat . In spite of Anne-Marie . As they passed from sight around an angle of the quai , I found myself thinking that nothing could ever really hurt them . Not , at least , the them of this moment , now . That particular them was eternal . Then I got ready to go down and see Harry at his apartment . I called him first . Hill came by again the next evening , Sunday the 5th , just at dusk . This time he came alone , all by himself . There had been very little happening , as far as I could tell , during the day . The French , even young French Revolutionaries , take their Sundays pretty seriously . M. Alain Peyrefitte , the young Minister of Education , had put out some rather threatening communiques saying substantially that the small groups of dissidents causing the trouble would be dealt with summarily by the college authorities if they did not desist . But if these were meant to quell the student troubles , they were apparently having just the opposite effect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , were more concerned with what had happened Saturday night and Sunday morning at the Palais de Justice , that huge and frightening grinding mill of bureaucracy situated like some great pile at the other end of the Ile de la Cite . The judge on duty for the weekend , one M. Isambert , had been lenient on Saturday . In the end only a few , six to be exact , of those arrested actually came before the judge , and he let them all off with small suspended sentences and light fines . But today on Sunday at eleven A.M. , Hill told me , Judge Isambert had sentenced four students to two months in jail . Maybe his breakfast was burned . More likely it was on Government orders . This was going to play a big part in the coming demonstration tomorrow , Hill said . Before anything else , their comradesmust be freed . In spite of my little fight with Anne-Marie , they apparently had taken me in and accepted me as one of them , Hill told me , or at least as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they could talkp75freely . Of course , Hill had introduced me to them all as an editor of an American review who very likely would write something in my Review to aid their cause . But all of this was not really why he had come . After he helped himself to a Scotch and soda at my little bar , he brought up Harry . " Did you talk to dad ? " I nodded . " Well , what happened ? " " Well , as you probably suspected  --  or at least as I suspected  --  he was hurt that you did n't come to him . " " Well , what did he say ? " " He said in effect that if you should need anything , like money or help or legal help or whatever , all you had to do was let him know or come and ask him for it . " Hill frowned and made an irritable gesture . I waved him down and continued . " Or that , if you did n't want to do that , you could use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him through me . If you did n't feel like coming home and asking him for it yourself . " Hill was suddenly and absolutely outraged . " God damn him ! God damn him ! Both of them ! Would n't you know he 'd pull some cheap trick like that ? I knew he 'd pull something like that ! Does n't he know , do n't they both know , that I do n't need anything they 've got to give me ? Do n't want anything they 've got to give me ? They just ca n't keep from trying to get into the act , can they ? Cheap hypocritical liberal bastards ! " I was completely taken off balance . I just gaped at him . I did n't see anything at all wrong with what Harry had said . And as if aware of me suddenly , Hill got a hold on himself . He drew a deep breath in through his clenched teeth , clenched his fists tightly against his flanks at the ends of his long arms , and shut his eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I thought it was a bit theatrical , but later I wondered . Because Hill had a hard time reestablishing himself in the high mood he had come in with . He flung himself down , with a gesture curiously like his father , in one of my armchairs ; and there he brooded . Talking t o him was about as worthwhile as talking to a stone post . When hep76finally left he was himself again but it seemed to me it had cost him a considerable effort . As he started to get up out of the chair , he looked at my windows and said wistfully , " It sure is nice here ! " He turned back to me at the door . " I 'll try and keep you informed of what takes place . But if what I suspect is going to happen happens , after tomorrow , I may not be around to see you for some days . In any case , do n't worry about me . I doubt very much if I 'll see much more action on the barricades . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  the whole group , not just our sub-committee  --  is trying to do is arrange in some way to have a true film record of what 's going to happen between us and the forces of order . " He italicized that last phrase , in a deadly way . " We 're in the process of forming a Cinema Committee of the May Revolution . All of us are Cinema majors , you see : the future directors , producers , screenwritersof the New France . If it works out , as it appears it will , I 'll probably be spending most of my time behind a desk organizing the shooting of what transpires in the next few weeks  --  so our side can present its picture to the world , to contrast with the Government 's propaganda films . You can tell my father that . " Then he added , " If you want to . " I nodded and we shook hands , hard and tightly : for all the world like two combat men being sent off on different missions from which we did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And yet I could n't help it . After he had gone , I went again to my window , and watched him swinging off down the quai toward Cite , in his young Revolutionary 's " uniform " . It was then I noticed , after leaning out a little and looking up the other way , that for the first time the two dark-blue camions of police had been stationed on the Island side of the Pont de la Tournelle beneath the Tour d'Argent , in position to block off the Quai de Bethune where , as every inhabitant of Paris knew , M. Pompidouthe Prime Minister lived . It was the first time the dark , sinister-looking little vans had appearedthere , but they were to become familiar.  |p77IT  WAS SOME TIME during that week of May 6th to May the 12th that some of us Americans established a pattern of meeting at the Gallaghers ' . Every evening around seven , a group of Parisian Americans would congregate at Harry 's apartment . It was like a sort of late cocktail hour . We would discuss the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ news on TV , drink a good deal , and speculate on what might happen tomorrow . Then we would move on to our dinner dates , or whatever we had lined up for the evening . As the rioting got worse night after night , the **26;12729;TOOLONG TV showed less and less about it . Finally it was hardly worth turning the TV on . The Government had decided it was going to play the whole thing down to the French people . Apparently , it hoped the problem would just up and disappear . We got news about the forthcoming Vietnam Peace Talks and Ambassador Harriman , and about how many the Americans were killing out in Vietnam . Hill Gallagher , of course , had not been seen by any of us since the Sunday night when he had stopped by my place alone . ' There were student riots every night now . In the French press they were already calling the students , more or less as a compliment , les enrages : the enraged ones . Hill 's manif ( I always thought of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arranged it all ) , Hill 's manif on the May 6th Monday , although not allowed by the police , was a howling success as a call to arms . On the Tuesday of the 7th some 15,000 students paraded all around Paris in a 12-mile march , and the police let them . On the Wednesday the Government offered to reopen the Sorbonne : the students immediately threatened to " occupy " it . So the Sorbonne stayed closed . Nobody thought that soon France would be literally paralyzed , in the throes of one of its worst social upheavals in this century . Yet somehow our pattern of clustering together established itself anyhow . Everyone was excited and there was a vacation feeling in the air . More than anything , it reminded me of the first weeks of World War II back home . It was almost the same . Everybody knew it was holocaust : that catastrophe , that too much useless killing , was coming . But we enjoyed the beginning anyway : it was a welcome break from the hackwork of daily living and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that in Paris . I know it was during that week I started showing up every night at the Gallaghers ' . And it was during the tail-end of that week that Dave Weintraub first brought Samantha-Marie Everton there . We were a pretty catholic group even for Paris-Americans . And almost all of us had some other reason for needing to be near there . I lived only just down the street , and I had no TV . Then there were two separate painters whom the Gallaghers had been buying , who both had apartments just across the river in the Latin Quarter near the Place Maubert . They were finding it hard to get home at night sometimes , if the students happened to be rioting at Maubert . Then there was an American TV commentator who was quite a famous face back home and was an old poker buddy of Harry 's . He had to be out shooting and commentating the nightly riot every night . So he would stop by for a few drinks and some " Revolution " gossip , before he crossed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the tear-gas clouds of the Quarter like Tarzan plunging into the jungle . There was a very young twenty-two-year-old UPI man who was doing the same thing for UPI , without a cameraman . He was a friend of Harry and Louisa because he wanted to be a screenwriter , and also a novelist , if he had the time.  |p79There  was a wealthy , good-looking American businessman who was unmarried and lived on the Island . He would show up with any one of an apparently endless string of lush young  --  well , " humpers " , I believe they are called  --  that he had access to : humpers , that is , who do it with rich men for kicks and presents , as distinguished from call girls who do it for set prices of hard cash ; and all of whom always lived in the heart of the Latin Quarter , naturally . There was a portly young redheaded **25;12757;TOOLONG publisher 's assistant to a French publishing house whom Harry had met somewhere , who at 32 was so Continental he could hardly be classified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gang of us with snobbish employments of the monocle he affected . He would stop by every night after walking out from his office in the depths of the Quarter , to have a few drinks to clear the tear gas out of his throat , he said , before calling a cab and going off to Auteuil where he lived . There was Weintraub . There were some others ; and there were still others whose faces changed night to night . And it was into this homogenized milk of Americans that Weintraubfinally introduced the lactic acid of the young nineteen-year-old American Negro girl , Samantha-Marie . Looking back on it from after the end of the ballgame , that week seems like a pretty dull inning now . Sure , it was a week of student demonstrations , and students rioting all night almost every night . But none of us felt that this student revolt could actually penetrate to the very heart of French life , and jerk it to a standstill . Normal life seemed to go right normally on . Housewives out shopping pushed with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ centers students and police charged shouting or retreated , heaving paving stones and gas grenades at each other . ( Sometimes it was very funny : to see the carriage-pushing mothers weeping as if their hearts would break as they pushed along ; and then look down and see the babies sitting quietly in their prams blinking and weeping , too . ) And  --  at least , that week  --  the Metro subways ran , autobuses and taxis continued functioning , you could still call New York ( or in Harry'sp80case , the South of France , where his current producer was shooting ) . Food was plentiful , and there was not yet any talk of hoarding sugar or flour . Sometimes the traffic got blocked up on the Boulevard St.-Michel and the Boulevard St.-Germain when the students were out , and there would be a great deal of illegal horn-honking , and a long wait . But by detouring around the Latin Quarter entirely , you could get to where you were going in Paris in the normal amount of time . The students had three basic demands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their seven convicted comrades released ; they wanted the special riot police ( the CRS : Cornpagnies Republicaines de Securite ) withdrawn from the Latin Quarter ; and they wanted the Sorbonne reopened and classes resumed . At the same time , they maintained they would continue to boycott the year's-end exams . But they would consent to sit down with the Government and discuss their program for the reforms they wanted . You have to understand that it was all really a question of timing . For example : To the eternal credit of their profound perspicacity and insight , the Government started off the week by refusing all three student demands . The arrested comrades were not released , the police were not withdrawn , and the Sorbonne remained closed . Only a few agitators were causing this , they stated in their news leaks , not the great mass of the student body . So on the Monday of May 6th , their big demonstration banned officially , the students took to street-fighting again and to building in the Quarter their barricades of paving stones , tree guards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ iq hours all through the night . On the next day the big , nonviolent , unauthorized but uncontested , six-hour , 12-mile march was made all around Paris by more than 20,000 students some said ( anyway , a number which obviously startled the authorities ) , only to end in more barricades and street-fighting when the police tried to break it up after the march was finished . And it was happening now in other cities , too : Toulouse , Strasbourg , Lyons , Bordeaux . Two other young leaders had emerged alongside Dany le Rouge : Jacques Sauvageot of UNEF , the biggest students ' union ; and Alain Geismar of SNE Sup. , the young teachers ' union . On Wednesday the 8th , after four days of refusal , the Government finally offered top81reopen the University  --  if the students would stop demonstrating ; the response , instead of the agreement the students would have given three days before , was now a wild student sit-in in the middle of the Boulevard St.-Michel , tying up traffic for three hours , and a stated threat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the students would take it over and occupy it . So on Thursday the Governmentannounced the Sorbonne would stay closed , and the demonstrationsand street-fighting began again , this time early in the afternoon . It was all one long history of changing their minds , inefficiency , bungling , blundering , and execrable , inexcusably bad timing . Our group of Americans , in our almost ritualistic pattern of meeting at the Gallaghers ' every evening , watched and read and discussed it all . Almost everybody had been out at some time or other to watch . I had not been out to the riots myself . I had been working hard , I had a considerable number of dinner dates that week , and the whole thing bored me . But Harry had been out . He had been out quite a number of times . But there seemed to be strangely little he could tell about it . He said there was a strangely nonserious air of gaiety about it all . It was too vivacious . He did n't think it would accomplish much . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the students . You might almost have said he was jealous in some odd way . They had not heard from Hill since the previous Sunday when I delivered them Hill 's second message . But Hill had had some young woman ( Anne-Marie the pipiste , I wondered ? ) , who seemed to be " working " as his " assistant " they said , telephone them a couple of times . And he had been home once , they found out from their maids , to pick up his big Bolex 16-mm zoom-lens movie camera . But he had sneaked in and out without seeing them . I found them both strangely unworried about it all . I knew I was worried about him . But they just seemed to go right on . Harry had made a deal two months before , and was deep into the writing of a new , American-Western . Louisa went out to her lunches at Lipp 's or Alexandre 's with her friends , shopped afternoons , entertained at home nights or went out with Harry . They both seemed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was more as if Hill were away at school atp82some American university back home , instead of maybe running for his safety from the tough Paris cops . " Naturally , we 're worried , " Harry said when I finally asked them . But then he stopped . And he went on with whatever it was he was doing : fixing himself or me a drink , I guess . I had been very careful with them , when I told them about Hill 's second visit . I had underplayed Hill 's reaction to Harry 's offer of help . I had n't lied . I had told them the offer angered Hill . But I had not told them how angered . Neither of them had reacted . Not in any way I could see , anyhow . And I went away with a distinct feeling that if I had told them : told them how first strangely furious and then melancholiacHill had acted , that they would not have reacted to that , either . Finally 1 stayed late one night . I waited till all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bring it up again . This all was a long way from the powerful parental reaction I had seen that night back in April , when Harry telephoned me to come over because Hill was n't home . And I wanted to know what was going on with them . This time it was Louisa who answered me . " Of course we 're worried , " she said , just like Harry . But then she smiled one of her superior New England smiles at me , the kind that always irritated me , though I 'm sure she never knew this , or was even aware of the superiority . We three were all alone . The Portuguese maids had cleaned away the TV-and-cocktail debris of glasses and hors d'oeuvre plates , and had retired to the kitchen . McKenna was in bed asleep . But then when I brought up Hill , Harry seemed to just sort of fade away and disappear , too : fade right into the wall ; or bend and secrete himself behind the bar or a chair somewhere . So that Louisa and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somewhere there behind me ; but I could not turn to look for him without taking my eyes and attention away from Louisa . And this quickly became increasingly impossible to do . I recognized dimly in some other part of my mind , with a small inner start , that to do so would be to insult her seriously , perhaps irreparably . I had seen her get the bit in her teeth this way several timesp83before , some about politics , and once about summer camps . You simply dared not disagree with her . " On the other hand , we know he 's doing exactly what he wants to do , " she said . " And what he wants to do is what we want for him : what we want him to do , too . " Her faint New England drawl seemed to get visibly longer and more prominent as she spoke . Sitting on the couch , she tilted back her head and let her long New England jaw drop at me . And her veiled green eyes , always a prominentthing with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her face : now , they looked like two spot-lighted marbles . The smile seemed to tell me she was thinking very critically of me , her old friend Jack . " After all , it was Hill 's decision to make . And we would certainly not attempt to interfere in that . So that , in quite another way , I can say that we 're not worried about him at all . We 're glad : that he 's there . We 're proud : that he is out there where he is . " " Well , " I said . " Yes , of course . I mean , there 's very little chance of his  --  " " Getting killed ? None at all , or almost none , " Louisa said . " But even if there were . Even if there were , we should still want him to be where he is . We , Harry and I , are totally and without reservation on the side of the students in this thing . We 'd be rather ashamed of Hill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't want him to have to be coming home every day to reassure us , when there are important things he ought to be doing instead . We do not even expect him to telephone us . I told that little girl that . We will go right on carrying on here , I told her : that is the best way we can help Hill . Help them all . " I could imagine what Hill would say to Anne-Marie about that . " Well , " I said  --  somewhat inconclusively , I suppose . But I found myself , without knowing why , on the defensive . Somethinghad got her up on her high horse and from up there there she was looking down with those marbles for eyes and haranguing me , while I down below stood feeling I had put my foot dumbly into some bear trap , steel-sprung and saw-toothed . " I expect we have all the normal parental anxieties , Jack , " she said . She shook her head . " But those count for little . And since Hill was notp84raised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we could expect him to do anything else than what he 's doing . " " Well , yes , " I said . " Yes , of course not . But I just thought that , if you both wanted to , if there was any way to  --  " She said it for me . " Contact him ? " The superior smile seemed to writhe around on her face for a bit . " And how would that get done ? " " Well , " I said . Of course she was right . " You 're right , of course , " I said . " He did say something to me about some lofts . But he did n't give me any addresses . " " There you are ! " Louisa cried , triumphantly , as if she had won a whole war from me . I was beginning to wish Harry would turn up , from wherever it was behind me he had hidden himself , and get back into this . " I just think that it 's horrible for them to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " Those kids are young , and idealistic , and they have a perfect right to protest against this hypocritical society that they 're forced to inherit and live in without any choice in the matter . If the young are not going to protest , who on earth is going to ? Harry and I have been fighting the same two-faced , hypocritical human society all our lives . We are backing these kids all the way , Harry and I , and we are going to do everything we can to aid them . " The green marbles of her eyes seemed to have gone unfocused . " We are whole-heartedly behind everything these youngsters are doing . Is n't that so , Harry ? Is n't it ? " " Absolutely , " Harry said from behind me . " Yes , absolutely . " He came up . He was carrying three new drinks . He gave one of them to Louisa , and then another to me , kept one . But I had a distinct impression he had used the making of them to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conversation . " To see those kids out there , taking those beatings from the damned CRS , is just beautiful . It 's just something beautiful to see . " From the corner of my eye I saw Louisa bob her head emphatically from the couch . She smiled on us a kind of breathless , aggressive smile . And the eerily brilliant green eyes in her long face seemed to be looking far away . I am sure she was unaware she had a drink in her hand . It is a hard thing to explain . I am sure Harry went away deliber/ately . And when he came back , there seemed to be just the slightest hint of a less than full enthusiasm in Harry . Let me put it this way : His passion for the student movement , while every bit as heartily stated , was a hair less fervent than hers . Still , this was a long distance from the way he had been talking the past days . I had an uncanny but powerful feeling that something here did not have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do with the student movement , either . Did not even have to do with that " hypocritical " human society they all , and me too I guess , disliked so much and were against . And Louisa seemed to have hypnotized herself into a kind of breathless , quiet female hysteria , with her talking . I am convinced that when people are crazy is when they oversymbolize . I mean when every act , gesture , word symbolizes more than it itself is in its own nature is when people are crazy ; certifiably nuts . " If they had come to my apartment , jack , " Louisa smiled , " I would have moved heaven and hell . I would have left no stone unturned until I went back out in the streets with them , back to their lofts and their unwashed washing . " I was upset . It all made me nervous . And not only that . I found myself placed suddenly in the position of the villain . Without any preparation . I was held responsible with regard to Hill and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Me , who had been publishing pieces in my Review on Berkeley and the student troubles in America for over a year . Both of them began to talk at me about how little I was doing , and how thoughtlessly selfish I was being , and what was I doing ? and why was n't I doing ? Finally , when I could finish my new drink politely without seeming to have tossed it off in too much of a hurry , I took my hat and crept quietly away , feeling somehow guilty . As if , in coming to them about I ill , in having seen him and brought them news of him , in fact by having allowed Hill to visit me in my apartment at all , I had become responsible for everything bad that might happen to Hill , and to the st udent movement , and to the Gallagher family itself . Louisa saw me to the door . But her glassy eyes and her voice were both far away . Outside on the quai it was dark . I set my hat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to shake off my awful feeling . Over in thep86Quartier sirens wailed , and tear-gas grenades thudded above the chants . Up in the air between some buildings over there , there was a bright flash , and then a deafening report . It was one of the new percussion grenades the police had begun to use now . And up on the corner of the Pont de la Tournelle squatted the dark little vans of special police , like two awful bugs in the dark night.  |p87I  REMEMBER IT WAS the next day , Thursday , Thursday the gth May , that I first went out to look at the riots for myself . I do know what special thing made me decide to go out that particularday . But I do not know if I can describe it . As I 've said , at that time the whole thing bored me . I had other interests going . And I had no desire to get myself mousetrapped against some apartment building as innocent bystander , and get beaten up by half a dozen CRS riot police . Perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But I was not that naive any more . Not the cynical jack Hartley of today : divorce ; small time editor ; failed writer at a variety of forms , and 47 years old with two arthritic knees . I preferred to ignore it . But that Thursday something happened , something in the air , that made it impossible to ignore it any longer . I must try to get this down exactly . I had risen as usual around eleven , had my coffee and orange juice served me as usual in bed together with the mail by my Portuguese . Then I made my usual morning toilet . Now , my morning toilet is always one of the best parts of any day for me . Showering : then shaving slowly and leisurely with one of my set of straight razors given me by my grandfather : selecting one of my several Caswell-Massey cologne waters , a luxury indulgence on my part I admit , since they could not be bought in France , and hadp88to be sent from New York : attending to my ageing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my grandfather used to say : If you do n't look after your teeth , you ca n't eat ; and I love to eat , as did he . It was one of those times of the day when being a bachelor really paid off . No women running around scattering powder everywhere and leaving the water taps not quite turned off . No female hammering to get in and use the john or the mirror or the toothbrush  --  just when you were about to apply bared blade to lather for the first sensuous stroke . There is no instrument invented that will give you the absolutelyclose , clean , satisfying , esthetic shave that an old-fashioned straight razor will , if you keep it cleaned and take care of it . Then , feeling marvelous , I had dressed and gone to work at my desk editing a revolt piece which had just come in from a professor-friend contributorat Berkeley . I think now that I must have become aware of excitement in the air while I was making my toilet , but that I failed to notice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as I sat down with the revolt piece I realized immediately that I had been sensing excitement for some time . Almost at once I found I could n't concentrate on anything , certainly not on editing an intellectual revolt piece . It was another sunny day . There was a breeze on the river . A lot of people were out , on both sides of the water , walking along and enjoying the exceptional weather . None of this was unusual . But something else was . It is my habit to keep my quai windows tight shut when I am seriously working , but now the closed windows could not keep out the electric quality that was in the air . More than anything it was like a bullfight day in Spain . I thought immediately of the San Fermin Festival in Pamplona : in the morning when one first gets up , late , after staying up all night drinking and waiting for the running of the bulls . Nothing was happening , but people were preparing themselves , just the same . There is an indefinite buzz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , soon people will begin to leave the hotels and houses and move toward the bars and cafes for talk and the first drinks , then there will be a long leisurely lunch with a lot of sangria while the excitement mounts higher , and finally the general exodus toward the bullring in the thickening buzz :  |p89Something  is going to happen today : There will be danger : Maybe someone will even be hurt : Oh , boy : And we are there : We are the excited audience . That was it . That was what it was . The audience . There was an audience in Paris . And the audience was preparing itself to go to the arena . A low , constant murmurous sound as of great crowds of people , an oceanlike sound , it seemed to seep in through the very walls themselves and through the glass panes of the windows . It was monotonous , did not rise or fall in intensity or pitch , and it carried on its low soundwave this air of intense holiday . I tried to go on working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the windows and looked out . Nothing was especially different . It was still the sunny day . It was still the same quite-a-few-people abroad , walking and enjoying the sun . Then I opened the window . It was like opening a dam . I was engulfedin a torrent of sunny , happy , gabbling excitement like an electrical charge , that churned in and swept through the apartment and washed against its walls in a golden flood . The soft air puffed at my face and the sun touched it , as if it too was sucked in with the torrent 's gush inward . I leaned out . Down below people strolled along the quai in twos and threes . On the wide cobbled landing at the top of the ramp under the trees below my windows , a kind of loafing place alongside the moving foot traffic , a group of at least ten was staring off intently toward the Left Bank across the river . Children , and older people too , ate Esquimaux or munched on the large waffle-like crepes sucrees . I felt I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hotel for the first drink and bullfight talk of the day . And with the window open now , I could hear faintly the isolated shout , the chant , a thin piping command , the thud of a gas grenade , the great rending crack , though muffled by distance , of a percussion grenade . The cops and the students , they 're putting on a show ! Puttingon a show ! Let 's go ! Let 's go ! It was noon . The Festival was starting . How could anyone work ? I put my foot up on the windowsill . There was a larger number of students than normal among the strollers . Most of them were dressed in the by now recognizable " run- ping shoes and bandanna " uniform . All of them were laughing inordinately . Happily they strolled along in twos and threes , sometimesarm in arm . They were coming from the Left Bank , across the Pont de la Tournelle at the rue Cardinal Lemoine , passing indifferently by our two camions of CRS police , whose men studiously ignored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recross the river there via the footbridge , and the Pont d 1'Archeveche which butted on the rue des Bernardins , which led to the Place Maubert where they were apparently fighting for the moment . There was an awful lot of them , and they did not stop coming . So , their damned Revolution had finally come to the Seine islands , had it , damn them , I thought grimly ; and found myself grinning . You could n't help it . But the air of electric gaiety and holiday did not come solely from them . It was in the faces of the older people , too  --  the rotund little Frenchmen with their gray moustaches and dark caps and baggy suits ; the older women dressed in dresses designed not to hide but simply to cover their good French fat ; the younger ones in their New York-cut suits and ties and miniskirts . They were all in it together , whatever it was ; and whatever it was , it was fun . Behind me my Portuguese came in and interrupted me . This was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me she had just heard on her kitchen transistor radio that there was a big bagarre , a truly big fight , going on over at the Place Maubert . I gave up entirely on my Berkeley piece and stayed in my window to watch . I could almost see Maubert from where I stood , but not quite . The tall houses along the Left Bank cut it off from my view . But I could see the cloud of smoke and tear gas above it . Maubert was a marche , a street market , on the Boulevard St.-Germain almost on a level with Notre-Dame , where St.-Germain junctions with the rue Monge , which can be considered just about the eastern boundary of the Latin Quarter . It made a nice large junction for erecting barricades , when all the market stalls were taken down . The sun was pleasant and warm on my face and shoulders . I saw , picked out , the high bald dome of Harry Gallagher glistening in the sun as he crossed the Pont de la Tournelle . Harry was striding in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When he was below me , I leaned out and called down to him . " Wait up . I 'm coming down . " We stood against the sidewalk 's belly-high stone parapet . Students who passed us on the sidewalk grinned merrily at us . I grinned back at them . " You 've got to admit it 's exciting , " I said . " Oh , it 's exciting . " Harry had been up to the Brasserie Lipp in St.-Germain for lunch and had walked home through the students ' quarter . " I could n't work , " I said . " I had to give it up . There 's too much excitement all around . " Harry gave me a professional smile , but he looked as if he had not heard me . All through the Quartier the students were out in roving bands , he said , and the place was alive with platoons and companies of riot police , not only the CRS now but also the Gendarmes Mobiles , really a military force , armed with unloaded carbines and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being requisitioned by the Prefect . Barricades were up all over the place , and either being defended , or abandoned , or breached by the police , and then torn down by the truckloads of public-service workers who followed them . " But they have been doing that for days , " I said . " What is so differentabout today ? " " Something is , " Harry said . " I do n't know . But it 's gotten bigger . Whatever it is . " " They 've been fighting at Maubert before today , " I said . " But it never bothered me from working . What has changed ? " " Something has , " Harry said . The students were apparently trying out a new tactic , he went on , which consisted of raising a barricade at some undisputed point , which of course would bring the police in their camions , then after a small fight retreating and fading away , while by radio or motorbike informing another group to begin doing the same thing somewhere else . They were keeping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this way . They seemed very well organized . In addition , large contingents of police were blocking off all the bridges on the Left Bank side , from the Pont Alexandre III at the Invalides to the Pont an Double at the front of Notre-Dame.  | " They 're not going to have ally police left , " Harry said , " if they do n't watch out . " Place Maubert had been one of the big fights today , he said . Barricadeafter barricade had been put up , lost , sometimes retaken there . Both of us looked across the river . We could still hear the occasional chant or shout or muffled thud of a grenade , coming across . And the tear gas made a high , rising cloud of white above the tops of the houses over there . Right then , I made up my mind to go over there , and have a look at it . " Well , I certainly ca n't work around here , " I said . " It 's amazing to see them put one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All they need is one crowbar to start it , and then a couple of shovels to keep it going . They form human chains to pass the paving stones along . There 's something truly ritualistic about it . " " Well , they 've certainly had enough centuries of practice at it for it to become a ritual , " I said . I coughed . " I ca n't get over the feeling that I 'm at Pamplona for San Fermin . " Harry grinned . " It is like that . Everybody 's having a ball , all at once . The whole town . " " I 'm going over there and have a close look at it . Do you want to come along ? " " No . I 've already been . I 'm going home . You 're not going to work any more ? Come on walk down with me toward my place . " Just then , suddenly , across the river , a mass of running bodies , students ' bodies , squirted around the corner of the narrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , moving toward the Pont de 1'Archeveche at Notre-Dame . No police came after them . " We 'll have a beer at the Brasserie , " Harry said after the flurry had passed away . We moved out into the stream of walkers , and I walked along with him . I could not get over a feeling that Harry was wanting to talk to me about something . " What was it you were going to say , Harry ? " He did n't answer for a moment . " I was n't going to say much of anything , " he said . We walked some more.  | " I just ca n't help but think that they 're not doing any good , " he said in a different voice . This clearly was not what he had been meaningto talk about . " The kids , I mean . They 're getting themselves all beat up for nothing . And I do n't think they 're going to do any good . It 's all just too  --  too frivolous . " " It does appear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " Hell , when we were kids demonstrating back in the Thirties , we did n't have any of these kinds of attitudes , or act like this . We did n't do this . " " What did you do , Harry ? " " Well , we . . . " It trailed off , as if he were taking a moment to formulate something . But then his silence continued . We were just strolling again . " I suppose it 's that I do n't like being relegated to the sidelines , " Harry said , and made a rueful smile . " I do n't like being classified as an old fogy and tucked away on a shelf . I do n't like being told I 'm an old-man member of a conservative Establishment who does n't understand , and never knew what it was to revolt . " He paused . " But it 's more than that . I do n't like being told it 's my generation that 's solely responsible for everything that 's wrong with the fucking world . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history ? Did n't they hear about the war we fought with Hitler and Tojo ? Did n't they ever hear about the Depression and the New Deal ? The House Un-American Activities Committee in 1950 ? Who the hell do they think they are ? " I did not try to answer this . It was rhetorical , anyway . " They do n't want us , " Harry said . " They do n't even want to utilize our knowledge and experience to help them . "  --  Another trio of laughing students passed us and grinned happily at us . " They do n't want anything to do with us or our past , and I do n't like that . I also do n't think it 's very sane . " I had been thinking and feeling a lot the same way , since seeing Hill  --  and his Anne-Marie . " Maybe you just do n't like not being young , Harry . " " Maybe . And I 've thought of that . But I 've never thought of myself as young , or not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever applied to myself . "  | " But now they are applying it to you . Through their eyes we must look pretty old ' , Harry . " " Well , I do n't mind being old . I even like it . Let somebody else pick up the old torch . But I refuse to be old ' just because these kids think I think old ' . Hell , I can still get it up three or four times a day . Anyway , at least you would think Hill would know differently . " " Why ? I think Hill least of all would . Hill is the young bull pawing and snorting to take on and pull down the old bull . " " And take over the herd . Sure . Chart-class Freud . The young buck wants to screw the doe I 'm screwing , even if it is his mother . Especially if it is his mother . Chart-class Freud . Christ , Jack ! " " Okay . I know it 's so general it has n't got any applicable meaning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same thing when you were young . " " Yee-ah . " He said it , half-breathed it , in the old tough Hollywood way that Julie Garfield used to say it in his films . " You and your analysis . A great lotta help . And I wish you 'd stop saying when you were young ' like that to me , for God sake . " I hope he 's all right , " he added . " He 's all right . Nobody 's been killed yet . " " As far as we know , " Harry added . " Yee-ah ! " he said again . We had reached the Brasserie . That was all we ever called it . Its full name was the Brasserie of the Red Bridge of the Island of St. Louis : Brasserie du Pont Rouge de l ' le St.-Louis . There was n't any red bridge , but apparently there had once been one , way back . It was our local pub on the Island . It squatted in the ground floor of a building at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ St.-Louis which had been put up temporarily in 1940 when a peniche barge had crashed into and weakened its old stone predecessor , in a tiny Place where a few late beer-drinkers stationed their deux chevauxslate at night , and it served the best beer in Paris in stone mugs . It was generally closed Thursdays but it was open now , and it was crowded with people , and the bridge was crowded with people . A group of its patrons and habitues stood outside its painted windows on the sidewalk with the gray stone mugs in their hands , and stared over at the Left Bank . Harry stopped.  | " I think I 'll beg off on that beer , Jack , and go straight on home . " He put his hands in the pockets of his khaki drill pants . He jiggled some keys . " No , about what I was going to say before , back up the way . " For a moment I could n't read his reference . Then I remembered . He peered at me quizzically . " I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upset or angry about the way Louisa and I jumped on you last night . We lit on you pretty hard . "  --  " I did n't want to complain about it ; but neither did I think I ought to pretend it had not happened . " There certainly was n't anything personal in it , " Harry said . " We were n't attacking you . Hell , you 're the best friend we 've got . Louisa , I think , feels that even stronger than I do . And you know how I feel . " " You do n't have to tell me that , " I said . " It did n't really have anything to do with you at all . We 're in a strange position , with Hill out there . I guess a lot of parents are . " He lowered his head , and looked down at his shoes . " Politics and college kids are two things that really turn Louisa on . Put them both together in something and . . . " " It made me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oddly strange way . And I do n't think I deserve to . " " Fuck , you certainly do n't , " Harry said . " But you know how Louisa is about politics . She wants so badly to help . We 're really behind these kids , Jack . Really behind them , all the way . " " I thought somehow that maybe there was something more behind it than that , " I said . " I mean , I felt that . " " Well , there was n't , " Harry said , looking me squarely in the eye . It seemed to me he was looking me too straight in the eye , or doing it too carefully . " Well , I 'm glad , " I said , simply . It was n't my business , anyway . " Louisa was n't  --  We were n't after you . Louisa 's always gotten these moody spells . Especially about politics . Louisa has n't ever been able to do all she 'd like to do . It 's pretty hard being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them feel that , I expect . It 's worrisome . I know Hill 's younger than I am. "  --  To me that seemed a strange thing to say . " And I would n't have it any other way . I mean , it stands to reasonp96any father 's got to be older than his son . But I sometimes do n't think Hill sees it that way . And sometimes I do n't think Louisa does . " " I think Hill sees it , " I said noncommittally . " I do n't know about Louisa . " " Well , I just wanted to explain . Louisa was n't  --  We were n't after you , last night . " " Oh , forget it , Harry . I do n't really care . Tell Louisa that . " " Be careful over there , " he said as he left . " I mean , you do n't run so good any more . Just do n't get caught between the lines . Especially when a charge is working up . I 've found that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's best to circle back around on another street that is n't in dispute . " He waved , in a kind of awkward way that made me feel sad for him and warm . I still had the feeling that he was trying to tell me something about Louisa that he had not been able to say . Or that I had not been able to get . In the fact , I had seen her in those strange moods before , a lot of times . But her attacks had never been directed at me before . You had the feeling when she was in those moods that if you disagreed with her even in the slightest way , you would destroy her whole psyche , crumble her all up like a handful of soda crackers . She seemed to expect that you would , and how dare you ? You felt she might brood for weeks , for months over it . Yet I had never thought of her as being goofy , or even very neurotic . I was sure she was n't goofy . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , somethingstill , that had nothing to do with what we all had said . I went in the Brasserie . It was cool and dim in there . They kept a thin film of sawdust on the tile floor around the bar in the front . I ordered my beer . It was served in my own special stein , with a pewter top . All of us habitues had our special steins , which were all kept apart , on a separate shelf . The long dining room in the back had hardwood floor and no sawdust , and it was crowded with luncheon eaters . I had been coming there for years , and knew all the waiters by their first names . But I suddenly felt constrained about asking them about the riots . Anyway they were all very busy . The bar was crowded too . The waiters all wore white shirts , black four-in-hand ties , and in winterp97little red sleeveless sweaters , above long blue-denim aprons that wrapped around the back and tied in the front . The place was owned by Monsieur and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of brothers-in-law , Madame Dupont 's brothers , and one thin little old grandmother with an old white dog . Today Madame Dupont was on duty and sat up on a stool behind the cash desk which was placed against the wall , between the bar and the dining room . The waiters from the dining room had to pass this cash desk and run behind the bar , shouting their orders , to the kitchen which was on the other side . Sometimes the grandmother sat up there , sometimes MonsieurDupont , and other times one of the brothers-in-law . Beside the cash desk was a table usually considered the family table . The waiters had a table on the other side near the kitchen . The Duponts had bought the place the first year I lived on the Island , and had been doing a huge business ever since , huge enough that Madame Dupont now sported a leopard coat and purse and wore Chanel suits which , whether they were high-class copies or not , looked like real Chanel . They had a 14-year-old daughter , whom I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was sitting at the family table , and came over to me to say hello , her young breasts covered only by a slip under her sweater . She had nice legs . It was astonishing to think I had watched her grow from almost a baby . " Well , what do you think of it ? " I asked in French . " It is certainly something , is n't it ? " she smiled . She always smiled shyly at me , and always blushed . I was sort of the place 's " very own American " , more than Harry , and maybe that accounted for it . She had the short pert Bretonese nose of her father , who was a tough hombre , and she was sweet when she blushed . " You are on the side of the students ? " I said . She blushed again , and smiled more . She was really very tiny , dark and olive , with black hair . " M'sieu , the police have entered the University . That has not happened in a very long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , and the police have flaunted it . Also , the reforms of the students are good reforms , and are necessary i It the modern world . " " You 're not at school today ? " " My school is closed , " she said shyly . " The students there are on strike , also . Many of them are out marching . " She went to a lycee , the equivalent of our high school . " The lycee young are out , too ? " I asked . " Oui , M'sieu , " she smiled . " Certainly . Many of them are . My school is . I grinned at her , because I thought I already knew the answer . " But you are not marching with them ? " She blushed again . " Maman would not let me . She does n't understand . " Still smiling , she cast a loving look over at her mother . From the cash desk Madame Dupont , who had been listening to us with attention , and who had the long aquiline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rocked her head on one side and put her hand up by her ear . " The young . Mind you , I am with the students , I think they are right . But they are very young . And a young slip of a young girl like that , out marching against the police . It is n't even sane . " It was from her that Marcelline got her olive coloring . She was a good-looking woman , with a fine figure , though perhaps her bottom had spread a little with the ten years of success . " I wanted to go , " Marcelline said simply , blushing . " Maybe you ought to let her go , " I said to Madame . " You see ! " Marcelline cried , clapping her hands . From the backgroundthe oldest of the brothers-in-law , Marcel , smiled at them fondly . " M'sieu Jack ! " Madame said . " You do not really mean to say that . " " I am perhaps only thinking of the possible dental bills , that is all , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her fine smile at me . " As well as possibly other bills . " She was a very attractive woman . She could n't have been much more than five or six years younger than me . She would be just about my wife Eleanor 's age . I looked at Marcelline , 14-year-old Marcelline . The two of them , mother and daughter , exchanged a look of open love . " In any case , M'sieu , " Marcelline said , blushing , " I thank you for your aid ! I shall not forget that ! " I shook hands with her formally , gravely . It was all a joke , all a warm family joke , with Marcel the **26;12784;TOOLONG , and on the periphery of which I participated ap99little . But it was good to see open , honest family love , that was not dominated by either open or hidden resentment of same . " Plenty of time for her to go out marching against grown-up police later , if she has to , " Madame smiled , as I finished my beer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not even University yet . " " But I will be ! " Marcelline said . " Plenty of time , plenty of time , " Madame said . " You be careful over there , " she said to me , as Marcel the brother-in-law shook hands with me formally for having stoppped by . I nodded and winked at them . Harry had said the same thing about being careful over there . Well , I certainly intended to be careful . The footbridge seemed equally crowded with people going to the Left Bank and people coming from the Left Bank . There was a steady two-way stream across the cite behind NotreDame , and on the Pont de 1'Archeveche . The Left Bank quai was jammed up , with a veritable mob of people moving under the leafy shade trees . But the old cathedral looked the same . That old stone barn , raised to tribal blood gods , had been sitting there on its haunches brooding over the bloodletting rituals of mankind for centuries . Beautiful and useless , it squatted over us all . With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to something or other . In the street lots of the children carried balloons . I did not feel scared . It was impossible to feel afraid in the gay excitement . This was completely different from the war , and the dense excitement that comes on you like an additional weight of gravity , before going into an attack . I crossed the Quai de Montebello , after waiting on the traffic light . I entered the narrow mouth of the rue des Bernardins . At once , the crowd stopped moving so much , became almost stationary . In front of me mainly what I could see were the backs of many heads . Mostly they were the backs of heads of Arab Algerians , who largely lived in this quarter . It is as easy to tell an Algerian by the back of his head as it is a Chinese . They shuffled and craned , but forward movement had stopped . They were not densely massed , and it was easy to slip in and out among them. lip ahead a big roar went up from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the crowd by all the heads in front of me . The crowd stirred a little on its feet . I went on , slipping in and out , slipping in and out . At the moment I did not give a damn , and I wanted to see what all this crap was about , that Harry had been talking about in the past few days so proprietarily . You have to understand the topography of the Left Bank and the place of the Place Maubert in it , to understand its importance during the weeks of rioting . The Seine flows through Paris in one long curve from the East to the Southwest , cutting off as it does so about one-third of the city from the other two-thirds . This one-third is called the Left Bank , and of it about one-fifth , roughly bounded by the Boulevard Raspail on the West and the rue Monge on the East , is called the Latin Quarter . The area is largely dominated by the great pile of the Pantheon , which was built on just about the top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a church , but later was taken over and made into a lay memorial to the French Revolution and to France . The bloodletting rituals played an important part in its history too , and were conspicuouslypresent in its murals and sculpture . A couple of blocks below it , west and toward the river , lies the Sorbonne . And a couple of blocks below that is the junction of the boulevards St.-Michel and St.-Germain . These two main arteries cross the area of the Latin Quarter in roughly the shape of a crucifix , if you placed Christ 's head at the river . And their junction , called the Carrefour St.-Michel , is the spiritual and emotional heart of the Quartier Latin . From it Boul ' St.-Germain curves gently northeast to meet the river at the Pont Sully , and about halfway between these points on the Boulevard lies the Place Maubert . Maubert is a sort of arrowhead-shaped square and market into which run about six streets , two of which run steeply uphill crossing the rue des Ecoles ( Street of Schools to you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big square that surrounds the huge mass of the Pantheon . Thus , this area is almost in the heart of University ground . The students could descend easily in swarms to fight there from their homebasearound the Sorbonne and the Pantheon . They could , as well , fade away and retreat back up the hill when over-matched or out-powered.  |p101And  the Place Maubert , in addition to having the largest local food market in the area , also had the advantage of being supremely disruptiveof traffic , always a student objective , since it junctioned with a main artery from the south side of Paris , which was the rue Monge . It was almost as good a place to fight as the symbolic Carrefour St.-Michel , and some ways was even better since it had more choice of escape routes and its arrowhead square gave more room to maneuver . It was the perfect place for the students to make a diversionary fight when they wanted to take pressure off the Carrefour . I came out of the rue des Bernardins into Maubert in exactly the kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were preparingthemselves to charge the students ' barricade . I came out right in among the extreme left of their line . I could have laughed out loud , thinking of Harry , except I realized instantly that any laughter would be exceedingly out of place right here and now . Across the square a kind of not quite visible fog hung everywhere . The sweetish , acrid smell of tear gas was strong . Already , my eyes felt scratchy . Four automobiles and a couple of grocery bikecarts lay on their sides across the Boulevard St.-Germain right in front of me , but the students had abandoned this barricade . They had slipped their line left over to the mouth of rue Monge across the square , where they had pushed a couple of cars out but had n't had time to overturn them . Behind these they pranced , and jumped up and down , and chanted , and whistled and yelled at the police . A couple of them threw one each of the square granite paving stones with which so much of Paris is paved , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policeman darted out , threw a gas grenade , which fell just in front of the cars , exploded with a puff , and then lay there smoking . These were the CRS , armed with the long hickory riot sticks , and carrying shields . They had a different kind of helmet , with a silver strip of ornament running back along the crown . A couple of them right beside me who could not have been more than 19 down there inside their uniforms , goggles , helmets and gloves , glared at me with all the bloodthirst of dedicated head-hunters . I stopped dead still . There were other people standing around , too . But they had been there . And I was new . In fact , all around the square things were going on normally , only inches it seemed awayp102from the combat . People went into the tabac and bought cigarettes and came back out to watch . I stood absolutely still , my hands quiet at my sides . The two boys muttered something , growled almost , tapped their sticks suggestively in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like horses , with wild-eyed absolutely contemptuous insult . I knew explosive hatred when I saw it . Every animal does . So much adrenalin pumped into a system has to have release , and the animal part recognizes that . I could probably have backed off , with an obsequiousmovement . But some other part of me calmly did not think that was the right thing to do , and said quietly inside my head : stand your ground ; just , do n't move . But then , any movement of mine at all might have triggered them , and both of them would have me on the ground that quick and be on me beating me . So we stood . Then the officer down the line shouted a command , and my two boys turned and began with the rest of the line to run across the Place . One 's coattails brushed me . The moment was over , I was no longer the subject of attention . Across the square the students , there were about 30 of them , faded away : into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They stopped after they had gone one block . The police stopped after they had passed the improvised two-car barricade . Of course , everywhere traffic had ceased on the two thoroughfares . I got out a cigarette , and noticed somewhat abstractedly that my hands were shaking a little . I still was not scared , and had not been . The students had certainly made a mess of the square . Broken glass , wet black ashes of cardboard and wooden crates , piles of the paving stones , and the overturned cars with their windshields and headlights all broken out now littered the area . Large light patches of yellow sand showed where the paving stones had been taken up by the hundreds , the thousands . Fire trucks had sprayed the burning crates and boxes , and the water had carried the greasy black filth of the ashes everywhere . Every shop in the market around the square was closed and shuttered . It was for just this the French all had and firmly maintained iron shutters on their shops . Two ambulances stood silent in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Units of Red Cross men in their gray uniforms and white helmets waited together , smoking and looking tired and occasionally shrugging their shouldersp103at each other and at the entire panorama . There were quite a few American and British tourists with cameras , taking pictures . Platoons of the Gendarmes Mobiles , different in their black jackets and blue pants from the CRS , stood around holding their unloaded carbines like quarterstaffs , waiting for orders . For some reason I did not know , a platoon of these filed out and replaced the group of CRS who had captured the two-car barricade . Public-service workers were already at work struggling to clear the streets . A block away the students jeered . The platoon of Gendarmes Mobiles got ready to advance another block . I had noticed that the nearer you got to Maubert and the action the less talking and laughing there was among the crowd . By the same token , I had noticed immediately that the nearer you got to the real action , the less nervous the crowd became , and therefore the less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first cry or wave of movement up front . Harry was quite right when he said there was a curious ritualistic quality about it . It was as if there were a tacit but definite set of rules both sides abided by . The police did not really try to capture the students , and the students did not really try to stay and fight hand-tohandon their barricades . The volleys of paving stones by the students seemed to reach a definite peak and subside , after which the police would prepare to make their charge . It was like a ritual dance almost . There was always a 20 to 40 yard no-man's-land between the two , with the students on the defensive and retreating slowly , while the police took the offensive by charging , but slowly enough to let the defenders retreat . Their strategy obviously was to take over more and more blocks of streets , while herding the students back away from the Sorbonne until they dispersed . The tactic of the police was to keep close enough and charging , so as not to give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new serious barricades . I followed them for maybe an hour . The students backed up rue Monge to rue des Ecoles , then backed around to the left on Ecoles . The police followed them street by street , charging but never quite reaching them . At the rue Cardinal Lemoine the students turned to the right back uphill , backing toward the Place de la Contrescarpe , another hotbed of student activity like Maubert . Twice , following Harry 's advice , I circled around on another street to change sides from one side to the other . On these unfought-over streets everything went on normally , and people shopped , though there was a saturation of excitement in the air . On the student side , there were many more students than were out in the street fighting , sort of following along and watching . There were tourists , taking the eternal pictures . Everybody was weeping copiously , and grinning , laughing . On the police side , I was belly-shoved once in the chest by a Gendarme Mobile , and told to get back , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quickly after a platoon that was just passing . The original unit of Gendarmes Mobiles had been joined by two others , so that they moved up the street after the students in a leapfrogging way , from both sidewalks and in the center . I saw one student taken in . I did not see him actually captured , so I did not know how they got him . But I saw two Gendarmes Mobiles carrying their carbines at the balance in one hand , turn him over to three CRS who were lurking around . There were pairs and trios of CRS all around . It apparently was their job to take care of the captures . These three CRS carried the rubber matraques with the iron rod in the center , which while they probably shocked and hurt as much or more than the hickory sticks , did less physical damage . They clubbed the student to the ground with their matraques , while he tried to protect his head with his arms , and then got him by the armpits and rushed him wobbling away , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mouth hung open , and there were various little streams of blood running down his head out of his long , somewhatgreasy hair . The clubbing was absolutely unnecessary , since he was half out and already bleeding somewhat , when the Gendarmes Mobiles turned him over . And behind me out in the street the other fighting students were shouting and laughing , went on roaring and throwing , having the time of their lives , with a kind of marvelous self-righteousness I had not seen since my own college days and our raids ' . Soon after this I left them . They were still backing up the ruep105Cardinal Lemoine toward Contrescarpe . The excitement was intense , and it never let up . It was so emotionally exhausting that in time it exhausted you physically as well . I walked back down the hill on Cardinal Lemoine , to pick up a carton of cigarettes at my local tabac at the corner of St.-Germain , cross the Pont de la Tournelle and go on home . On my way , I saw a CRS man who evidently had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home to supper . He had taken off his helmet , and was wearing his cloth overseas cap . He carried his helmet close to his leg , his hand wrapped in the straps , as if trying to make it unobtrusive ; or as if signaling with it in a quiet way that he was not working now . He did not have a riot stick , and he did not look guilty . He looked like a working man going home to supper . I got my cigarettes , crossed the bridge past the two camions of CRS still sitting on it there , walked on home to shower and leave my cigarettes , and then went on down to the Gallaghers ' where the American group should be meeting.  |p107IT  Is NOT DIFFICULT to describe Samantha Everton . The difficult thing is that once you have described her , you have not described her . The difficult thing was she seemed to be and act exactly what she was and thought . My grandfather taught me long ago nobody is ever that . I was standing at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought her in . Louisa , instantly hovering over the black girl like a protective mother hen , escorted them slowly down the room , introducing her . The girl moved beside Louisa casually , but tensely . Even from the bar Weintraub 's stentorian voice , made falsely deep , was easily heard . The girl stood quietly behind him , almost submissively , with a thin-lipped ironic smile on her small face . " That 's Dave 's new girl , " Harry whispered . " He picked her up Tuesday night at Castel 's . She 's staying with him at his pension . He called Louisa about her . " " What do you mean , new ? " someone said . " I did n't know he ever had any girl . " Weintraub went on introducing her loudly . So there she was . She was a black , but so were a lot of the others who showed up at the Gallaghers ' . She was 19 . She was not unusually beautiful in the face . She was sleek-looking , but she did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daughter . Rosalie Everton was the great Haitian singer . All of us knew her by reputation , and some of us had seen her perform . But we all were used to stars and celebrities  --  and , in the last few years , to the celebrated children of stars and celebrities . Anyway Samantha was not at all celebrated . Weintraub was making it blatantly obvious that she was at least for the moment functioning as his mistress . She accepted this , smiling her ironic smile . Louisa hovered around them both , looking distressed . Whether Samantha knew as we did that Weintraub had almost never had a girl of his own , I still do n't know . Finally , they got to us . " Gentlemen , this is Weintraub 's new love , " Weintraub told us in his deepest voice , with an arm flourish . " Take a good look . SamanthaMarieEverton . Yes sir , she 's bunking up with me in my little one-bed pension . The old joint has never seen the like . " She smiled directly at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and have no place else to go , " she said sweetly . " That 's true , that 's true , " Weintraub added quickly . There had been genuine pride and pleasure on his face when he looked at her , as well as a look of surprise at his luck . It made me feel sad for him . There was a reliant compactness about her , as if she were holding herself all in solidly together . As she had moved further away from the door , and therefore further into someone else 's territory , it seemed that this compactness got visibly more compact . She slipped up onto a bar stool . She was clearly wearing no underwear at all . Her eyes were a strikinggreen , and she had dressed to them . Above was a green knit pullover with no sleeves at all , which showed off her lean , exquisitely shaved armpits ; and on the front of this the nipples of her small unrestrained breasts made two visible bumps . Below , she was wearing those lowcut , skintight summer stretch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belt and big buckle . The tight crotch of these was up so tight against her that the pants outlined quite clearly for you the two lips of her little crack . This was not unusual , though , was par for the course , in the spring of 1968 . She was quite dark . But her features were not very Negroid . She had some white and some Indian in her . And she had a 19-year-old 's body which , in my day , was a valuable asset one never appreciated until onep109had lost it . But that could not be said of Samantha . She was small . Her hips were narrow and boyish . But she still had that high , hard , largebuttockedNegro derriere that a great many find so attractive . Her hair was cut short , boy-like , around her ears . We had been talking about our adventures of the day watching the riots . There were five of us at the bar . There was the famous TV commentator , there was the young UPI man , there was Ferenc Hofmann-Beck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , part Hungarian-Americanwho was the French publisher 's assistant . There were Harry and myself . I would have thought that those tight pants would have been most uncomfortable , for a girl , but if they were , Samantha gave no sign of it either standing or sitting . Samantha , it turned out , liked to be called Sam . She had an annoying , and arrogant social habit . When she shook hands , she would hold onto your hand and search your face , slowly , and quite openly , for something . Then , not finding it , whatever it was , she would drop the hand and turn away to the next , indifferent . I thought it had to be a ploy . Nobody could do something like that unwittingly . She lingered over some hands longer than others . She spent no time at all over mine . Somebody told me later that she had lingered over Louisa 's longest of all . I looked around for her , but Louisa had left us . I like to remember that moment , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nothing that I know of anywhere exists , now , as did that apartment at the moment before Weintraub hove into view through the entry doorway with Samantha-Marie in tow , for all the world like some tiny burly tug hauling , not some great ocean liner , but a sleek black-hulled racing yacht . His formidable voice , always too loud anyway , continued the metaphor and served as the tug 's deep , belching steam horn , announcing to the rest of the harbor the acquisitionof a new major prize , as he introduced her , hovered over by I , uuisa , to first one group and then to another . " And this is your host Harry Gallagher , " Weintraub 's steam horn brawled . " Hello , Mr. Gallagher . I know your films , " Samantha said , and thrust her hand at him across the bar . She turned from me to Harry a smile that was much too ancient , much too ironic for any 19-year-old.  | " This is some pad you got yourself here . " She looked back down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refectory tables covered with art books and statuettes glistened in the fading sunlight . Around them Louis Treize fauteuils or smaller armchairs clustered , where people sat and talked or stood . Against the inner wall sat a rare hexagonal Louis Treize chess table , with the pieces laid out in some opening . On every bit of available wall space were paintings . The French windows were open on the summery May twilight , and the breeze riffled the white under-curtains , which had been drawn back against the drapes , to let the windows open and let in the night air . Harry looked at it , too . " What can I get you to drink ? " he smiled . " I never drink , " the dark girl said . " I might smoke a little if you 've got some . A little pot ? Otherwise , just give me a Coke . I love Coke . I like you , " she smiled . Harry went at once onto the defensive . " Well , I like you , too . Or I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other a little better . " He looked flustered , and confused . He busied himself fixing her Coke . " Oh , you will , " Samantha said . She accepted the Coke gravely . Then suddenly she laughed , a rich , high , girlish tinkle , vastly amused . I thought  --  we all thought  --  that she was darling . But I thought I just ought to cough a little here . Ferenc Hofmann-Beck had been entertaining us at the bar with one of his famous **27;12812;TOOLONG , when Samantha and Weintraub came up . Ferenc , thoughtfully , took my cough as his cue to continue . Ferenc Hofmann-Beck had been coming to the Gallaghers for about three months at this time . He had met Harry and Louisa at a party somewhere and had fallen madly in love with both of them , but particularly with Louisa , and had sent her a huge mass of flowers the next day with a card asking if he might telephone . When he telephoned , he begged that he might come by on one of her Sunday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been coming ever since . Ferenc resembled nothing quite so much as a huge , cuddly , reddishcolored , American brown bear . Strong as an ox , and shaped exactly like an upright pear , he affected , or truly believed that he had , a condition of permanent ill health brought on by his liver . He hadp111once had hepatitis years ago . His dull , carefully tailored English suits complete with matching waistcoats made him look like one of those roundbottomed dolls from your childhood which you could not knock over . He wore a Baron 's coronet on his monogrammed shirts and handkerchieves , but suavely never mentioned whether he was a Baron or not . In fact , his grandfather Hofmann-Beck had been a Baron , in the long-evaporated Austro-Hungarian Empire of Franz Josef ; and Ferenc knew by heart the right name and title , if there was one , of just about every family in Europe . He was a walking Debrett 's . He had a serious eating problem of which he made much fun , hated all forms of violence including the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mistaken for some kind of a fag if you did not have a good eye . Lately he had taken to wearing a monocle : a scallop-edged one : the latest , chicest type : which he would fix in his eye or fiddle with to punctuate his poking fun at French society engaged in a spelling-match , namedropping contest . Now he fixed his monocle and peered at all of us , but especially at Samantha , putting on his thickest Hungarian accent . " As I wass sayink about the O'Donnells . " Someone at the bar had mentioned the name O'Donnell . " O'Donnell ? O'Donnell ? Mit two Ns and two Ls ? I knew such an O'Donnell in Boston . Two Ns and two Ls . Peasants . Bums . Family had to leaf Ireland durink the second famine . Made money . But American money does n't make peasants not peasants . My grandmother used to say the silk purse iss not from the ear of the sow made . But now , O'Donel ! Mit one Ns and one Ls . I know such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Two big estates . I vissited there . Very fine family . Grows horses . " Ziss is rather like Gramont in French . Gramont mit one Ms is more chic than Grammont mit two Ms , though both are good . Gramont one Ms old and a duke . Grammont two Ms less old and only a baron . But II ass wines . " Ah , Miss Everton ! Ve have not met ! I am Hofmann-Beck . " He seized her hand and bowed over it without carrying it quite to his lips , clicked his heels and stepped back . " Everton ? Mit one Rs and one Ts ? I knew some Everrettons outside London mit two Rs and two Ts . Very large house . Excellent gardens . Could be of you some relations ? "  | Samantha smiled at him . " Are any of them niggers ? " At the bar there was a sort of helpless , full-stop pause , of utter silence , a sort of consternation of silent helplessness . " Actually , no , " Ferenc said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his sweetest , politest voice , with no accent , and he smiled . " Then I doubt if they 're relations , " Samantha smiled back . A short while later Ferenc drifted away , down the room , and I do n't blame him . It certainly put a pall over the bar . Of course , Samantha probably could not really be expected to get the joke . She had never heard Ferenc 's name-spelling routine before . But she ought to have heard the laughter at the bar as she came down the room . The joke of course was that in a suave , handsome way Ferenc was totally ignoring her color . Maybe she did n't want that . Perhaps it was just that she was diffident . That was what Louisa thought later . A long time afterward , weeks afterward , Samantha herself , during one of several long talks we had , told me in all seeming honesty that she had thought it was a funny line , thought that it would get a big laugh at the bar . I find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laugh . At the time I thought it was one of the most wantonly cruel things I had seen in a long time . And yet , there was about her that gamin-like quality , so coltish and innocently young when it cropped out in her grin , that delighted . You were continually being suddenly brought up short by the realization that this child after all was really only 19 years old . From behind us Louisa , sensing potential upset or dissension , had come back up . " Is n't there something else I can get you ? I mean , since you do n't drink ? Is n't there something else you 'd like to have , my dear ? " Samantha smiled at her , warmly . " Well , I do n't suppose you 'd have any  --  " She stopped . She looked at Louisa a long moment , smiling . " No , you would n't , " she said . Then she smiled again , warmly , almost lovingly . " I think you 're beautiful . " Louisa blushed right up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now ! " she said , in a sort of confused breathless way . " I really think you 're one of the most beautiful women I 've ever seen . I love you , " Samantha smiled . " I 'll tell you . What I 'd really like.  |p113is  a Hershey chocolate bar . With almonds ? I do n't suppose you 'd have any of those , would you . " " I do ! " Louisa cried . " I do ! " She was suddenly all eager eyes and bony smile . She positively glowed at the idea of doing something for this girl . " I do have some ! I 've got stacks of them , loads of them . " She turned on her heel toward the kitchen door in the corner . " Our daughter happens to be an addict of Hershey chocolate bars with almonds . " I looked down the room to where my Godchild lay stretched out in front of the empty fireplace . McKenna was all curled up like some halfgrownkitten , oblivious of the party all around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she read one of her perpetual Tin-Tin books . Tin-Tin was a young French comic strip character , who had all sorts of adventures with a bearded sea captain as his sidekick . Not even quite eight yet , she could already read like a ten-year-old . I remember , now , how completely secure she looked there . Her hair caught glints from the various lamp fixtures in the room , and their overlapping lights and shadow lit up softly the small-nosed , wide-eyed , serious little-girl face . " Can I have three or four ? " Sam Everton asked , when Louisa came back with the box . " Take all you want ! " Louisa pulled out a stack of them like letter envelopes . " Thank you . Thank you . I really do love you , " Samantha said , and leaned forward on her stool and kissed the taller woman lightly on the cheek . " Oh , now ! " Louisa said , and blushed again . " Come on , now ! It 's only candy . " Samantha drifted away from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Hershey bars . Later , I was talking to Fred Singer the TV commentator by the chess table , and happened to glance down the room and saw that Samantha was lying on the floor with McKenna . The two of them were lying on their bellies side by side , propped up on their elbows , contentedly munching Hershey bars , and reading the stack of childish Tin-Tin books with equally complete absorption . I knew McKenna did not make friends easily . Soon after that , Samantha and Weintraub left . " She 's taking me to some orgy , " Weintraub whispered , grinning . " Orgy ! " Sate said , looking at him contemptuously . " Orgy ! Orgy ! "  | " It 's the truth ! " Weintraub whispered to me , grinning . I went back up the room to Harry , and the bar . Ah , that bar . Was there ever such a bar existed anywhere , in such an apartment ? I guess Harry 's bar needs a whole paragraph to itself . It got to be famous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made over . What the French call a chaire , one of those pulpits which hang up on a column in the church , with a circular staircase mounting to it . In Harry 's apartment it stood on the floor . He had hunted two years for it , to find it . It cost him a lot ; and it cost him almost as much to have his ebeniste fix it up for him . The ebeniste repaired it , gave it a new , raised floor of ancient wood , and fitted it with two bar shelves of the same , for bottles . It was a five-sided object , with one side open at the back for the drink server ( or priest ) to enter . The other four sides were of wood panels , with peaked arches carved across their tops , below which dim worn figures carved in very low relief and vague with age could be presumed to be doing something religious . It jutted out from the far end wall of the room like the nose of a PT boat cresting a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shop in St.-Germain , thought it would make a great bar , only to find it had been sold the day before , and then had waited two years to find another . It was the showpiece of the entire collection of things . It was also one of Harry 's most prized possessions . " After all , " he liked to say , and said it often , especially when in his cups , " what are the real fucking churches of today , in mid twentieth century ? Where is the one fucking place where a modern city man can go if he wants a dim , quiet place to commune with himself ? " Where nobody will fucking bother him . Or make him feel guilty . Or tell him what he ought to do or believe . Or try to change his philosophy or ideology or faith . Where in short he can be by himself in quiet contemplation and suck spiritual nourishment from the liquid Communion in his hand and clarify his head . Where ! BARS ! That 's where ! And that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Behind it Harry had had the entire end wall covered with a pleated ,  |p115silver-beige  velvet curtain , to accentuate it . No paintings hung there . And against this drapery , on the one side leaned a beautifully made sixteenth-century German executioner 's sword ; and on the other , head down , leaned a horribly crudely made , brutally hammered , steel thirteenth-century executioner 's axe with a brass studded , unlathed and unturned pole handle . " The three greatest things mankind has given to the world ! " Harry liked to say , waving at the three of them . He meant , I gathered from questions I asked him after the first time I heard him say it , by the third " thing " not so much the exquisite sword itself as its clear evidence when compared to the axe , of man 's vast and divine increase in mechanical dexterity , within which Harry hastened to include both the Industrial Revolution and our own Technological Revolution as well . As if all this were not sacrilegious enough to suit him , or perhaps one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had completed the whole tableau with a clutch of five bar stools which were not bar stools at all but in reality those hardest to find and most expensive for their size Louis Treize items of all : the prie-Dieu prayer stools . There is a story that the first time Bunuel ever came to the place , he peered at Harry 's bar and its accouterments and then seized the two-handed German sword and tried to cleave Harry from shoulder to waist as he carried a tray of glasses in from the kitchen , crying , " You son of a bitch ! You son of a bitch ! My mother used to pray on a prayer stool just like that ! " And rushed from the house . Later , of course , he sent an apology . In fact , " Harry 's Bar " ( everyone made the obvious pun on Harry MacElhone 's New York Bar on the rue Daunou ) had picked up quite a singular history all its own in its seven years of existence . Certain dedicated Catholics , though known to be hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeing it . Several times there had been drunken near-fistfights over it right there in the living room . It had been dedicated by James Baldwin the first night Harry unveiled it , with a hellfire sermon on the evils of drink . Ah , that bar . Harry instituted a set of ground rules regarding it . The drunken political , social , racial , philosophical and artistic discussions got so hot and heavy around that bar that finally no one could get a word in edgeways , and if he did , could not hear himself , let alone the others . So one night Harry drew up rules . We had a lovely pulpit , why not use it ? Therefore , in any future discussions , anyone who wished could " Invoke the Pulpit " by simply saying so . The invoker would then be allowed to mount behind the bar and for a measured five minutes could have his say , all alone , while the room remained silent . This would be followed by an optional five-minute question period , at the discretion of speaker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I invoke the pulpit ! " from all over the room , and the ground rules remained . Harry had them printed and framed and hung them up behind the bar on the silver-beige drape . As I have said , it is with more than just a touch of sadness that I remember it . That apartment , and that bar . I imagine it closed and darkened , with the shining tables and rich fauteuils , antiques and statuettes all gathering dust in the gloom . I imagine it like that , even though I know that Harry has kept on a Portuguese maid to come in and take care of it twice a week . I am a romantic fool . Ah , that bar . I suppose that we are a generation of drunks , as Hill 's younger generation are all the time so loudly proclaiming . I have talked with them about it , and about the cowardice , wastage , and lack of responsibilityin it . But I fail to see much difference between that and the potsmokingand LSD-taking of their generation : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ junkies that they produce . If we have failed to much change the world we inherited from our parents , and have not given them , our offspring , any real moral precepts to go by , they do not understand that the generation of our parents failed even more to change the world they inherited , and gave us even less by way of any honest moral outlook . And I ca n't help but wonder what their children will be like , if and when they have them , whether we are drunks or not . And I suppose we are . I suppose we might go down in history ( in this new cataloging of the generations that has become so popular ) as " The Drunk Generation " , were it not that we have before us as example the generation of Faulkner and Fitzgerald and Hemingway  --  The " Lost " Generation  --  all nervously itching to take the credit , andp117jealously yelling " We did it first ! " , while monitoring us , guiding us , leading us by the hand toward the concept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while at the same time claiming the heavy consumption of it to be the quintessence of manliness . Ah , that bar . I suppose most of all I miss those hot and heavy drunken discussions we used to have around it . That was the Thursday night . The next night was the night of the Friday of May loth , and the Great Battle of the rue Gay-Lussac . I suppose it is silly , even dumb , to talk about that battle now at this late date . But at the time it was very important . It was really the first major turning point of the May Revolution , and from it the whole Revolution proceeded , probably . Yet , I think the real May Revolution began at some point during the day on that Thursday of May the 9th . Some time during that Thursday the people of Paris went over to the side of the students . And I think they did it , and it began , in gaiety and a sort of hedonistic social irresponsibility , which passed by osmosis from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suddenly did not want to work for the Patronat , the Establishment any more , at least not for a while . I know many believe it began the next night , the " Black Friday " of May loth , when the night battle on the rue Gay-Lussac so outraged the French with its police brutality . But I believe they were already on the side of the students , and that there would have been no great night battle if the students had now known this . Certainly it was the students who set the battle up , and forced the police into it . When more than three hundred people are hospitalized after a night of barricades ( and there were many , many more than that , who preferred not to give themselves up to a hospital and be arrested for it )  --  when that happens , it is bound to be an important event with big impact . We followed it on our transistor radios at the Gallaghers , on both the Europe Number One and Radio Luxembourg stations . As usual , the French @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there was a student uprising . It began late , after two A.M. , and everybody had left the Gallaghers long before that . I had gone out to dinner and come back later because we were all wondering about Hill . Student leaders had beenp118negotiating with M. Roche at the Sorbonne all through the evening , still about their same three demands , and the students themselves used the time to prepare themselves well ; they built barricades in depth all over the upper half of the Quartier : rue Gay-Lussac ; rue St. Jacques ; rue d'Ulm ; rue Lhomond ; Place Contrescarpe ; rue de 1'Estrapade . The police , under orders to wait , could only stand at the ends of the streets and watch . Finally , shortly after two A.M. , the negotiations broke down and the police were ordered to charge , to clear the streets , and the battle was on . Finally it coalesced itself in two spots , Contrescarpe , and Gay-Lussac . Gay-Lussac was apparently far the worse . Fred Singer the TV man finished his nightly reportage and came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lights on in the apartment , came up . He was redeyedand weeping and his nose was running copiously . " The damned CRS are beating up everybody . Strangers , foreigners , newsmen , photographers . I almost got beat up myself . And for a minute I thought we were going to get our equipment smashed . " The students had piled up cars parked in the street and set them afire . They were dropping Molotov cocktails down off the roofs of the buildings . The police kept on throwing in more and more tear gas . " I do n't see how they stand it , " Fred said , sniffling . " I did n't get anywherenear the heart of it , and I could n't stand it . " Harry made him a stiff drink . It was too far away for us to see or hear anything from the windows . But an eerie glow lit up the night sky over Montparnasse , above the Left Bank houses . We had the two American painters , one of them a woman , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home . There were no barricades near their area yet , but a lot of people were out and there was much activity in the street . At one point Harry and I decided to go out . We would sally forth up to Montparnasse to watch the battle still raging up and down GayLussac . But then Louisa said that if we went , she was going too . Louisa 's bright eyes were feverishly bright now , and her long-jawed face was grim with a kind of frenetic righteousness . If we were going out to look and take a chance on getting ourselves hurt , she was absolutely going , too . And if we were going out to get involved , shep119was going to get involved , also . She had a son out there . She had a son out there , too , she said . Harry took one look at her , and said she absolutely could not go , and that if it meant all that much to her , he would not go either . She subsided . But her face fell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , quietly . As a sort of placating compromise , I offered to telephone a literary friend , an American writer who lived on a small street that crossed rue Gay-Lussac , the rue de 1'Abbe de l'Epee , to see how things were . When I got him on the line , he advised us not to come out at all . " Things are really bad up here , Jack , " he said , " I would n't try it . " The agitation and excitement in his voice were apparent on the phone . " I 'm not even going out myself . The police are really cracking down tonight . We 've got half a dozen hurt students in here now my wife and I are trying to give first aid to , and every half hour there are three or four more taking refuge in our court . I do n't see how these kids can stand it out there . Even the police , with masks , ca n't go into that tear gas they 've laid down on Gay-Lussac . And yet these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retreat . " " All right , Clem , " I said . " Thanks a lot . I guess we wo n't go . " This was obviously something quite different than what I had seen the afternoon before . We did not hear from Hill that night , nor did we hear from him the next day , Saturday . In the morning we walked up to Montparnasse and rue Gay-Lussac to view the devastation . Lots of other people were out to look , too . It looked like a war had passed by . Turned-over and burnt-out cars littered the entire street in a series of fought-over barricades . Store windows were broken out , and some storefronts were burned black . The usual glass and debris , twisted metal signs , paving stones , and blackened fire filth were everywhere . Cordons of tough-looking police now held the street , and gave you a rough looking-over before allowingyou through . You had to have business there or you could not get through . I gave my writer friend 's name and address , in my best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife , who were high and excited , but exhausted , from their night of Red Cross work , we went back to the Gallaghers ' to find that no word at all had come from Hi11 while we were gone.  | JAMES JONESThat was the Saturday , you will remember , that M. Pompidou returned posthaste from Afghanistan . Only four hours later , and after more than 36 hours without sleep , the Prime Minister went on TV with a tight but remarkably well-delivered speech giving in to all the student demands . From it he emerged with a considerably enhanced , if slightly ragged-looking , dignity . Certainly it enhanced his popularity . " The great Zorro arrives in the nick of time to save the day , " one Government official was quoted in the paper as saying . It was certainly something Monsieur le General de Gaulle would never have accepted to do . Hill did not call Saturday night , either . Saturday seemed to be a sort of night off for everybody , while police and students both patched up their ranks and their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ student Revolutionaries and police alike . I suppose a lot of them went to church , and then had a big Sunday dinner . Actually , student groups were meeting with workers ' committees and union committees all that day . I had news that afternoon late , when I walked down the quiet treelined quai to the Gallaghers for what had now become a recognizeddaily ritual . Hill had telephoned me just before I left to go to his parents . " Where in the hell have you been ! " I cried . There was a kind of strange , frustrated pause at the other end . Then he said , " I 've been busy . Have n't you heard about the great battle ? " I was outraged . " Do you have any idea at all how worried we have been about you ! Never mind me , but your mother and dad ! Why in the name of God did n't you telephone ? " " I do n't think you understand , Uncle Jack , " Hill said tersely . " We 've got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we 've got to take care of them . Somebody 's got to . " This slowed me down a little . I could imagine him in some loft , like the one he had roughly described to me , surrounded by wounded and moaning students covered with blood . " Well , is everything all right ? "  | " I 'm okay , " Hill said , " if that 's what you mean . That 's why I tele-phoned . " " I gathered that . And I will tell your folks . But what I meant was , well , all the rest of it . " " We 're making out . We 're making out . As well as can be expected . " " Can I help ? Do you want me to come over there ? " There was a pause . " What could you do ? " " Well , I 'm still pretty expert at first aid . " " We 're past the first aid stage , we 're into the medical . Now , we need oxygen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do you know any doctors ? " " I know so-and-so and so-and-so , " I mentioned two doctors that I went to , and who were friends of mine . " They 've both been here , volunteering their help already . There 's really nothing you can do , Uncle Jack , really . " " Well , do n't hang up for a minute . Tell me , were you out in the middle of all that ? " " Sure . And I think I got some pretty good shots . Tell Dad that . I wo n't know till we get them developed , and there 's no place in Paris we can trust to send them to . The Government apparently has put a tag on all the photo-developing places with the idea of confiscating student film , if it is brought in . So we 'll have to wait . The light was very bad , and we did not have any artificial lighting . And you know how it is with a hand-held camera , especially when you 're breathing hard and standing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " at least you have won , anyway , all of you . Pompidouhas given in on all three of the student demands . The Sorbonne will be open on Monday . " His voice was almost a snarl . " Are you kidding ? Pompidou 's offer is only a token acceptance , to slow us down and cool us off a little . They will discuss reforms ' with us , they say . Well , we 're not quitting now . 11 the Sorbonne opens on Monday , we will occupy it . " His voice suddenlygot cautious . " And we may occupy something else , as well ! " What on earth could they occupy besides the Sorbonne ? I wondered . The Assemblee Nationale ? that would be real war . The huge GovernmentTV and radio building ; on the Avenue du President Kennedy : the O.R.T.F. ?  | " Then you 're not satisfied ? " I said . " Satisfied ? You should be where I 've been for the past thirty-six hours , and then talk about satisfied . No , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Hill ? " " I 'm calling from a pay phone in a cafe in the Place Contrescarpe . " I knew that area . There were ancient old lofts all over , all around that area , and on the rue Mouffetard . That was " Hemingway country " , as George Plimpton might say . " Well , where is it that you are staying ? " " I do n't think I better tell you , Uncle Jack . The police are still out after us , you know . They 'd love to find a loft full of us , wounded , and take us in to some hospital to show their humanitarian intentions . And then arrest us . " " I wish you 'd call your folks yourself , " I said . " I ca n't . You tell them for me . That 's why I called you . You 're going down there now , are n't you ? Jesus ! " he said . " Ca n't you imagine it ? Mother would be insisting to know whether I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me revolutionary advice : Now , son , this is the way we did it in 1936 . ' No , thanks . They 've never let me do anything on my own in my life . They 've protected me . " " I do n't think you 're being fair to them , Hill , " I said . " Listen , Uncle Jack , I 've got to hang up . " Some gleeful devil rose up in me . " And how is Anne-Marie taking all this ? " " Anne-Marie ? Oh , she 's having the time of her life . You never saw such energy , and bravery . People like her are in their glory in something like this . "  --  " I could imagine . " You 've got a thing against her , have n't you ? " Hill said . " You just do n't understand . You do n't understand that we do n't believe in onewoman , one-man monogamy . We believe in love for all , love given to all , and accepted by all . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Listen , Uncle Jack , I 've got to hang up . " " Well , I 'll tell your folks , " I said . " I 'm still your old buddy , " he said . That really made me feel bad . " I know . "  | " So long . I 'll keep in touch . " He hung up , and the phone went dead . I called Harry and Louisa immediately after , so they would not be kept in suspense about Hill longer than necessary . " I 'll fill you in on all the details when I get down there , " I said . Harry met me at the door . The apartment was already half full of people , the regular gang that was coming regularly every day now . " Come into the bedroom , " Harry said . " Louisa 's waiting . We can talk in there . " I followed him , down the long hallway , away from the living room and the entree . " I guess it 's my ego , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want those people to know Hill called you , instead of me . " Louisa was up on the bed , a mass of the satin throw-pillows against her back . She did not look depressed , or moody . She had on one of her at-home robes , and her hair was tied back . She had been cooking her curry in the kitchen apparently . The smell of it was delicious in the hall and in the entree , when I came in . Instead of the normal daily gathering , this was to be one of her old-fashioned , pre-Revolutionary Sunday evenings . And she seemed in fine form , which sort of surprised me . I told them everything Hill and I had said . They were interested , were not upset , and did not even ask any questions , except when I told them Hill had called from a cafe . " Where ? " they said together . I told them Place Contrescarpe . They knew that area of old buildings and lofts as well as I did . It was actually only a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all walked there many times . " He just does not want any help from any of us , " I kept saying over and over . " He insists this is something he has to do , and wants to do , on his own . " They seemed to take this easily enough . " I think Hill does n't understand that we are on his side , " Harry said . " I think he does , " I disagreed . " And I think that that is exactly what he does not want . I think he would much rather have you be against the students , like the other parents . " " I do n't think the parents are against the students , " Harry said . " Not the French . "  | " Well , some of them must be , " I said . " From what I 've heard . " " Maybe not , " Harry said , " maybe not . " Louisa suddenly got up off the bed in a bustling way . " Well , I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look after my curry . I 'll be out in a few minutes . " She gave a distinct impression she did not want to be followed , and neither Harry or I followed her . " I hope you wo n't say anything about Hill to the gathered assembly , " Harry said , with a strange sort of gallant laugh , as we walked back down the hall . " Sure , " I said . " Of course , not . Of course , I wo n't . " But somehow it irritated me that he should ask it a second time . The long salon was filling up with people when we came out into it . All of the old bunch who had been coming by every day were there , plus a number of others . There must have been 12 or 14 people , already in the room . Louisa Gallagher 's Sunday evenings had become quite a famous thing in Paris over the past six years . They were more known , though , in the Artist 's Quarter than in the American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by deliberate intent . Because all three of her Portuguese domestics had the full day off on Sunday , Louisa had started making curry on Sunday evenings , since they had to stay home to look after McKenna . Louisa could make a delicious , real Indian curry . A few people started dropping by , by accident , and then came back . The word got around , and more people tried to get invited . Louisa did not try to make a thing out of it , it was very informal . But she and Harry refused to let it become an open house where the people could come without being asked . Mainly we were artists , painters , writers , a few gallery owners ; almost all from the Quarter ; and of all nationalities . Hill sometimes brought groups of his French and American student friends . There was a smattering of movie people Harry knew . There was a smattering of people from the American business community , the established bankers , lawyers , engineers , and corporation people . The business community people came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come again . I do not think it was because of any especial temperamental differ/ence . I think we just made them uneasy . We were a pretty fiery bunch . We discussed everything . Nothing was sacred . There was a lot of drinking . There were a lot of four-letter words spoken , though Louisa never used them and neither did I. It was bound to make them uneasy . And I think the business community wives took a quiet but determined dislike to Louisa . It was as if , even though Louisa never spoke them herself , they felt she should not have tolerated the bad language or allowed it in her house  --  especially in front of her child daughter . I gradually came to suspect that some of the men of the American business community , though not all , would have liked to come again , and again . But their wives were not about to let them . Louisa , of course , could not have cared less . That Sunday there did not appear to be any of the American businesscommunity present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in some tinyMcKenna was at one of the refectory tables , absorbed so d hhldh homework she had too forer scoo , an se came running over to me with her arms out , to be picked up , tossed and kissed by her Godfather . She was getting harder to toss . She was growing , a lot . At the bar a group was talking over the events of the weekend : the surprising return of Pompidou , his even more surprising speech and acceptance of the students ' demands . The latest news was that a nationwide one-day general strike was being called for Tuesday the 14th , to protest " Police Repression " . Electricity , gas , water , transportation , telephone , telegraph , mail and taxi service would all be affected . Everybody was coming out on the side of the students . There would be no Monday afternoon or Tuesday morning newspapers . Banks , schools and many businesses would close . Students , teachers and workers would be on the march all across France to protest " repression " . The feeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shouting . Someone said the phrase " The Students ' One-Week War " , and others picked it up . There was elation at the bar over the students ' win , but there was a nostalgia for the now-finished Revolution . They were all so certain that it was finished . But I could not forget my picture of Hill , and the things he had said on the phone.  |p127Down  at the end of the room Weintraub came in with SamanthaMarie . Louisa apparently had invited them . They made their way toward us slowly , shaking hands and saying hello . Several others more had come in before them and there were now 18 or 20 people in the room and two of them were black people . One was a slender , beautifully muscled dancer from the Folies Bergere , a friend of Louisa 's , and of Harry 's too , but more of Louisa 's . The other was an old , aged painter , poor but famous in New York and Paris for ten or 15 years , who had the courtly manners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ painter . Weintraub introduced her to them . If Samantha felt any surprise or chagrin or anything else at seeing two other American blacks here , she gave no indication . And yet somehow I had a suspicion that she did . From her table McKenna ran out to meet her and clasp her around the knees . Samantha patted her head and kissed her . McKenna rarely ran to kiss anybody , and I found myself feeling jealous . Our discussion at the bar had centered itself on the question of whether the students would try to take over and occupy the Sorbonne tomorrow as they had threatened . Someone had asked if they would . Now that Pompidou had declared it would open . " They 'd be crazy to , " Harry said . I stared at him . He went right on blandly . " Pompidou 's given in to them on their demands . What 's the point ? Now 's the time for them to sit down with the Government and negotiate . Get the reforms they want for the University . Not keep the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ! They ai nt about to do it ! " Weintraub boomed , coming up . He had his arm around Samantha . At the bar Ferenc Hofmann-Beck , who up to now had been one of the most talkative , slipped off his stool and moved away . He gave Samantha a low bow as he passed her , and a sweet smile , his monocle in his fingers . He did not come back . " But why ? " Fred Singer the TV commentator said . " I have to agree with Harry . What 's the point ? After Pompidou 's agreed to all their demands . " " Because they do n't trust the Government , " Weintraub bellowed in his deepest basso . " That 's why . Every time the Government has given its word on something , and things have started to calm down , the Government reneges on its word again and forces the students a step further . And then they turn loose their jackals , the police , and claim it was all the students ' fault . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's true , " Fred Singer said . " The Government has been playing a **28;12841;TOOLONG game . " " All governments always do , " I put in sourly . " Look at our own . " Almost all of us were against the Vietnam war , if not for moral and political reasons , then for strategic and tactical ones . The Paris talks about it would be opening here tomorrow , in the midst of all this . This whole discussion was boring me suddenly . " That 's true enough , " Harry said to me . Then to Weintraub , " If those kids want to play with grown-ups , they better learn how dirty it 's going to be , when they finally get out there . " " They 're learning , " Weintraub said . " They 're learning damn fast . The students want a firm , solid bargaining position , " Weintraub said in his deepest voice . " And they believe the only way they can have that is to keep the Sorbonne closed and occupied . " He sounded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then maybe they should occupy it , " Harry said . Suddenly he scratched irritably at the close-clipped hair alongside his bald , sharpridgedskull . " But hell , you know the police could throw them out of there any minute they choose . " " The police would n't dare right now , " Weintraub said . " And the Government would n't dare let them . What do you think this big strike is all about ? Everybody 's on the side of the students . Even the shopkeeperson rue Gay-Lussac who had their shops burned , are on their side . " And those kids are mad , " he said . " Do you know nobody knows how many people were hurt Friday night ? Literally hundreds have n't turned themselves in to the hospitals . " " Where do you get all your information , Dave ? " I said thinly , and looked at Harry . Weintraub 's arm around Samantha had slipped down until his hand was on her hip , and now he threw out his burly little chest . He made one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he intoned deeply . " From the kids themselves . That 's where . " He turned to Harry . " And your kid Hill is one of them . Incidentally , he 's all right . "  | " Yes . Yes , we know he 's all right , " Harry said . " He 's been calling us . " Well , he told me to tell you that , " Weintraub said , a little more defensively . " Probably showing off to his buddies , " Harry said , easily . " I guess it 's not popular to be in with your parents right now . " I wanted to take some of the weight off . " Where did you see them , Dave ? " Weintraub was delighted to tell . He took his arm from around Samantha to give himself oratory room . He had met a group of them , at a little cafe-tabac in the Carrefour Odeon , a place called the Monaco , where a lot of American beatniks used to hang out years ago , and where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I knew the Monaco , and it was a pretty low dive . Anyway , Dave had seen this group of kids , students obviously , all huddled up over a table in the back every day , and finally one day he noticed Hill was with them and started talking to them . They were all students of Cinema at the Sorbonne and most of them were studying Sociology too , like Hill , and they were planning what they were going to do when the Sorbonnewas occupied , as all of the student groups had voted for . They were the leaders of a special Comite du Cinema des Etudiants which was assigned the job of photographing the Revolution , the occupation of the Sorbonne , and everything that happened after that until the end of the Revolution , whenever that might be . They all expected a lot more fighting . From their footage they intended to make a film which would show the world the real Students ' Revolution of France . When he described some of them , like Anne-Marie , and Terri of the long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hill and his group who had been to see me . Weintraub had offered them his help in any way he could be of help , and they had accepted it . They had a sort of perpetual rendezvous to meet at the Monaco every afternoon at three or three-thirty , if any of them could at all possibly make it ; and they had invited Weintraub to come , too . He had seen them there this afternoon . None of them had been hurt Friday night . " This afternoon ? " Harry said , and gave me a look . " At the Monaco ? You saw them ? " Hill had told me he was calling from the Place Contrescarpe . But there was no discrepancy in that.  | " Yes , " Weintraub said . " Why ? You know , the great thing is that they 've brought the workers into it , now . They tell me delegations of the students have been working like hell all week to do that , going out to the factories , and the auto assembly plants . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absolutely true , " Fred Singer put in , " that 's going to make all the difference come Tuesday . " We were suddenly off into another discussion , about the workers now , and their plans , their demands , and their hopes for wage increases . Above this , Harry gave me a knowing , sort of conspiratorial look . But I did not know what he meant to do , or convey . It was perfectly possible that Hill could have been at both Contrescarpe and Odeon during the afternoon , and it did n't make any difference if he had , or even if he had not . I could n't read what Harry was trying to signal . Then suddenly Samantha Everton , Weintraub 's little " mistress " , who had said practically nothing at all up to now , burst into the discussion with both her pretty feet . " I think it 's all a lot of bullcrap , " she said to us all with a covering grin , but there was an edge to her voice . I think it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as " Sam " . She had said before she liked to be called that . Instead of Samantha , or Samantha-Marie . I think it was the grin that did it.  |p131HARRY  GRINNED AT HER . " Say shit , " he said . " Bullshit . You can say bullshit here . " " Then , bullshit . I say , it 's all a lot of bullshit . " " What is ? " Harry said . " The Students ' Revolution . They 're not going to change anything . " She grinned up at Harry from the stool she had slipped onto . " Incidentally , I met your son , too . This afternoon . He 's a nice boy . " " Yes . Well , " Harry said . Then after a minute , " I 'm glad he 's all right . He is a nice boy . " " He 's a lovely boy , " Sam said . " But he 's much too young , and much too idealistic , for me . " " He has your age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has n't my experience . I like them older , when they 've been around a little . " " And you do n't think the students are going to change anything ? " Ilarry said . " Men like you , " Sam grinned at him . " What ? Change anything ? " She raised her voice , and the rest at the bar stopped talking to hear . " certainly not . No , they wo n't change anything . Oh , they 'll make the old folks give them a few little concessions and reforms . But they wo n't change anything . Revolutions ca n't happen in the kind of highly organized societies we live in today . And I 'm not so sure they should happen . Look at what their Revolution cost the Russians . Anyway , today everybody 's got to have his electricity and his water and his gas and his automobile . But Revolution ? That 's all horseshit . The TV would n't work . " Weintraub had put his arm around her , after finishing his oratory , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , just at the bone . Beside me , Sam twitched her hip irritably , and Weintraub 's hand disappeared from it as if shot away . " These kids are out there in the streets having the time of their lives . They 're having their war ' . They 're playing games . They 're getting their kicks . All getting their rocks off . That 's the truth about it all ! " She grinned her street Arab grin at us all . " I take it you do n't think the Students ' Revolt of Paris is very important , " Harry grinned at her . " No , not very . " " She just got in from America , you know , " Weintraub said . " Sure , I just got in from America . But I 've lived in France . Quite a lot . I went to school here two years . " Her voice got sing-song , " And I 've been in CORE . And I 've been a SNICK worker . And I 've been SDS . Students are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one person who did n't have personal ambition mixed in with his altruism . If I could find one . Students give me a royal pain in the ass . " " What about Mickey Schwerner , and those other two boys ? " Harry said . " Chaney and Goodman . " " James Chaney and Andy Goodman . What about them ? They 're dead , " Samantha said . " That was a long time ago . So what about them ? They knew what they were getting into . Or should have . They knew the chance they were taking . They went down there . Those two white Jewish boys were white Northern assholes . They were fools . They did n't believe those crazy rednecks would ever kill them . And the nigger , James Chaney , knew the chance he was taking in his home country . They all wanted to be there . " She shifted her little , high Negro behind on the old seventeenthcenturyprayer stool . " Oh , it 's all sexual , all of that , down there , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men . And probly for the niggers . Did you ever read that book ? That Huie book ? Did that man Huie everp133speculate on how much the crazy redneck sexuality might have played in the murder of those three boys ? No . " " He alluded to it , " Harry said . " But did he ever speculate on the real meanings of his allusions ? All those white women making those crazy obscene phone calls about orgies at the Center ? Down there , every crazy redneck believes black girls wiggle their ass better , and know how to clamp down inside better . And every white woman believes every black man 's got a big enormous schlong , and can go on screwing all night long . They hate their white men for screwing nigger gals . And the rednecks are terrifiedof being cuckolded by big black bucks . And rightly so . Because if their white women do n't do it , they sure as hell think about it . No , down there it 's all sexual , sick redneck sex . They 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Not if they think they can answer that with some sociology textbook about the Rights of Man . The textbook has n't been written yet about down there . " " You sound like you know the South pretty well , " Harry said . " Well , I 've been down there , " Sam said . " Students . Students make me laugh . You all make me laugh . " She slid down off her bar stool . She had no drink . " Your students 'll get their reforms . Or watered down half-assed versions of them . And so what ? Meanwhile they 're all out there running and yelling and having themselves a vacation , playing cops and robbers . They 're enjoying it , you 're enjoying it , the police 're enjoying it , and the French 're enjoying it . It 's a bore . I 'd rather talk about dancing . " I came in , here . " Do you feel that same way about the race riots in the States ? " I simply could not not ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pretty much . But when I was there we had some guns , and we killed a few people , and we burned down some warehouses . There , at least old nigger ladies are smart enough to steal themselves a free new TV set out of it . But as for changing society , hanging the world  --  " She shook her head . " The world , " she said , and paused as if searching for an unaccustomed word , " the world absorbs everything . Finally . I wonder if anybody 's talking about anything interesting down at the other end . " And she walked away . " Hey , that 's pretty profound ! " Weintraub bawled from the bar . He grade as if to go with her , but she gave him such a look of contemptu- ous dislike that he stopped . He turned back to the bar . She went off alone . Down the room , I saw Louisa come over to her . Her talk effectively put a damper over the discussion at the bar . But in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was still about the workers , and about how far they might go on the side of the students . But it tapered off . People left the bar to walk down the room . Finally only Harry , Weintraub and I were left . We huddled together at one end . Harry wanted to know more about Samantha . She had come on from New York , Weintraub told us , to Paris on her way to Israel , and had run out of money . In fact , that was incorrect , he said . She had come on from New York knowing she did not have enough money to get to Israel , but figuring something or other would turn up here to get her to Israel . " What about her mother ? What about Rosalie ? " Harry said . " Well , her mother does n't give her any money apparently , " Weintraubsaid . " She claims her mother does n't have much money . " She was going to Israel to live for a while with a friend . " A boyfriend ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Weintraub said . " A girlfriend . A Sabra girl . " There was something about the way he said it . " My God ! " Harry said . " A Sabra lesbian ? " " Why not ? " " She 's a lesbian ? " " I suppose . I mean , that is what she seems to like . " Weintraub tried a bluff grin . " But from personal experience I can say it would be hard to contend that she was n't double-gaited . " " Well , come on . Tell us all , Weintraub , " I said . He puffed out his really quite deep chest like a pigeon . He did not need much urging . She had been sitting in Castel 's in one of her little ye-ye outfits with a French girl whom Dave knew vaguely but only vaguely , nursing a Scotch and soda she did n't want . Castel , whom she knew from two years before , had bought her a bottle as a welcomingbackgesture . Dave had picked her up . She had been hoping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she did not have anyplace to stay . She had gotten off the plane from New York that morning with ten dollars in her pocket . Her bags were locked up in a tin locker at the Invalides Aerogare . Weintraub had taken her home to his one/room , one-bed pad in his pension . He had been feeling vague and strange and not very much with it that night because it was last Tuesday and he had been out in the streets with the students for a while . His clothes and his hair stank of tear gas . So did his room in the rue Conde , when they got there . There had been a fight in the Carrefour Odeon . He had taken a shower and put some stuff in his eyes . When he came back down the hall in his robe , Sam was sitting nude on the bed edge . She had looked at him quizzically and asked if he would n't like for her to call the other girl , the French girl . He 'd said what the hell , sure , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( she insisted that they wait ) he had asked her why she had n't let the other girl pick her up if that was her action , and she said she had tried but the other girl had n't made a play . And she herself had n't felt she had the right to pick the French girl up , since she did not have a room to take her to or enough money to rent one . Also , she thought the other girl maybe liked having a fellow around , too . What about you ? he had asked her . She had smiled and shrugged . I 'm here , ai nt I , baby ? was all she had said . Then the knock came on the door and they let in the other girl . Dave had seen her around with boyfriends a hundred times at least . And there they were . He had never suspected the other girl of making it with chicks . " Man , " Weintraub grinned , " I tell you , when you get together with two girls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like it in the world . " 1 stole a glance at Harry . There was a kind of deep glow in the back of his eyes . So they had gone at it for three days , Weintraub said , whenever the oilier girl did n't have to turn up at home and check in with her folks . Harry was squinting at him from behind the bar , leaning on his elbows on the back of it , but he had no comment to make . " I fell , I 've only known her five days , " Weintraub grinned at us , " and she 's already taught me a lot . " " Come on , Dave , " Harry said . " Do n't tell me there 's anything left . uiy l , ody can teach you at this late date . Not after this past winter . " It was a rare thing to see Weintraub reticent about anything . But he only grinned , and a special word about him seems necessary here . Weintraub for the past several months before the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paris . It was common internationalknowledge that there were two or three paying places in Paris where you could go and take your wife , or some other girl , and check your clothes at the door , drink nude at the bar and dance , and if you were so inclined adjourn to one of the cushion-floored rooms upstairs where others before you had already adjourned , to play games . You might even be invited up by someone who was not your date , but it was perfectly proper to decline , as you would a dance . But these places were only the paying places . In addition , there was a whole set of orgiasts who held their meetings in private homes , and where it was not proper to decline an invitation . Somehow , after living nearly 20 years in Paris without them , Weintraub had gotten himself involved with this set , perhaps by having gone to one of the paying places first . I remember he was telling Louisa all about it one Sunday evening two months before , standing in the kitchen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to walk in . Soon , in his inimitable way , he had told everybody else all he knew about it , and so everybody knew all about Weintraub 's orgy experience . Louisa had been blushing when he told it to her that time in the kitchen , but she had been interested to hear it just the same . As who would n't be ? Dear Louisa . " Hell , Harry , " Weintraub said . " You know I gave all that orgy stuff up , after a couple of months . I told you that . It gets to be a bore . I only did it just to see once what it was like . " He paused . " At least I did until that Sam appeared on the scene . She seems to know more people , and more houses , in that set in five days than I ever knew existed . " He paused again . " She likes to , loves to dance naked for a crowd of them , you see . " " She must have known them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " I suppose so . " " But what I do n't see , " Harry said in an intellectua ' way , " is what new she could have taught you that you did n't learn on the orgy circuit . " " Well , that 's it , " Weintraub said . " She did n't . I mean , not anything physical . It 's something else . That girl is totally without any morality . She has no guilts . I mean , she is n't immoral ; she 's amoral . She 's like ap137healthy , beautiful young animal . " A kind of shadow crossed his face . " She has absolutely no guilts about anything , or anybody . " He turned back to Harry . " That 's what is different . I have never seen anything like that . It adds a whole different dimension , different kind of dimension to sex , Harry . " " Yes . Yes , I can see that , " Harry said . " But I find it hard to imagine . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the shadow crossed his face again . Soon after that Louisa called us to eat , and brought in the huge pot of curry from the kitchen . Some of the other girls brought in the rice and plates and spoons and forks . Harry got out , and opened , the cold wine . McKenna was not allowed to eat the Sunday night curry , and had been given her supper earlier and had by now gone to bed . But the rest of us spent over an hour forking down the rice and curry and the chutney and Indian condiments Louisa bought at Fauchon , pouringthe cold Beaujolais down our scorching throats at intervals to cool them . We were all disgustingly full , sweating , and a little bit drunk , when volunteers finally cleared the dirty dishes away . Only Sam drank no wine . And she ate very little curry . After a token helping , she turned in her plate and sort of disappeared off by herself . I remember sitting on the floor and looking up from my plate , and seeing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the empty fireplace . She was munching on a Hershey bar Louisa must have got for her and reading one of the Tin-Tin comic books McKenna had left behind  --  just exactly as , and in just the same position as , she had done four nights before when she was with McKenna . It was she who suggested putting on some records . There was plenty of ye-ye stuff on the record shelves , because of Hill . With Harry to help her and manipulate the complicated hi-fi system , she selected a stack of them and put them on with the volume up high . Then she went off by herself and began dancing to it those strange , disjointed , jerky new dances my generation always looks so unnatural and silly doing . She stayed all by herself , totally oblivious to everyone , audience and non-audience alike . Some of us , some others , danced a little while and then stopped , gave it up . Sam went right on , all by herself , staring without seeing , jerking her body and snapping her crotch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until the stack was finished . I could imagine what she looked like doing it nude . And I could imagine Harry could imagine it . Everybody applauded when she finished and she gave us a sweet smile , but looked somehow startled , as if she had not been aware there was anybody else there . Later , she came over to us where Harry and I were standing alone at the bar . We had switched to Scotch . " What are you two older-generations ' talking about over here so mopey ? " Harry grinned at her . He seemed in better control than he had the other time he had met her . " Nothing that you should worry your pretty head about . Have you a subject you 'd like to introduce ? " " Yes . As a matter of fact , I do . I 'd like to make it with you , Mr. Gallagher . " She smiled a smile at him which warmed up her eyes so much that they suddenly looked furry and actively overheated . " I 'm propositioning you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Harry said . He grinned at her , and his eyes squinted until they were only thin lines . Then his eyebrows went up , making a washboard of wrinkles of his forehead . " We 'd certainly make an interesting couple in bed . " " There 's something about tall bald men that really turns me on . Tanned heads . Tanned heads between my legs . " " Great ! " Harry said . " But I 'm afraid it 's not possible , Sam girl . " His voice lay down heavily on the hippie phrase . " Why ? " " Because , unfortunately , I 'm a monogamist . I 'm afraid Louisa would take a very dim view of it . " " Well , bring her along . Bring her along , and we 'll all go to bed together , " Samantha said . " It 's really her that I like . I like her better than you , anyway . In fact , I think I 'm failing in love with her . " Harry was still smiling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said . " That 's certainly one idea . But I do n't have that kind of control over Louisa . You 'll have to ask Louisa herself . " " Okay , I will . " She slid lithely off her bar stool , and went swaying down the room . I was still dumbstruck . And I think Harry , at least now , was a littlep139startled too . He stepped down and came around from behind the bar . I leaned out from my own stool , saw I could not see from where I was , and came and stood beside him . Louisa was sitting on one of the couches at the far end with some of the others , talking about something or other . Samantha came up and knelt beside her and leaned on her arms on the low cocktail table . " Will you make love with me , Louisa ? " she asked . Louisa stared at her . Then her face blushed red right up into her hair . " Why ! Why ! Why , what would your mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Are you kidding ? " Sam said . Louisa was laughing now , in a flustered way . So were most of the others . " Why ! Why , I 'm going to tell your mother on you , you bad girl ! " Sam was laughing too , now . " Are you kidding ? My mother was a lesbian before I was born . Whenever I think about it , I 'm surprised she ever went with a man long enough to have me ! " " Well , " Louisa said . " Even so . Whatever possessed you to say something like that to me ? " She was still blushing , and she was still flustered . " Because I think I 'm falling in love with you , " Sam said , still leaning on her elbows , still smiling softly up at her . " I think you 're the most beautiful woman I 've ever seen . Did n't you notice it the other night ? " " No , " Louisa said , looking around in dismayed embarrassment . She was still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not . " " I just propositioned Harry at the bar , " Sam said . " But I only did it because I thought he might bring you along , too . It was really you that I wanted . " Louisa looked around again . Her hand had fluttered up to her breast . " Now you just stop that , " she said . " Get up from there . Me go ont with girls ? I never heard of such a thing . Ugh . " Sam got to her feet . " My luck . Always my luck . " She walked away from the couch , dropping her shoulders in a very cute , charming caricature of despair . " That always is my luck . " It was one of the most outrageous performances I had ever seen . And yet she had cleverly , charmingly , turned it off into a half-joke so thatp140nobody was really shocked and no one was insulted . Nobody , in fact , could even be sure she had meant it . Grinning , Weintraub came up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ai nt she something ? Did you ever see anything like her ? " Sam , smiling her street Arab grin , came right after him . " Come on , Weintraub , " she said sharply . " We got a party to go to . " She turned to Harry . " I did n't have any luck , Harry . Maybe the next time I come . Come on , Weintraub ! There 's nothing to keep me here now . Let 's go to our party . " " Party ! " Weintraub grinned . " Party ! She 's taking me to another orgy . " " Orgy ! " Samantha said , glaring at him contemptuously . " Orgy ! Orgy , Weintraub ! Bark ! Bark ! " " Aaaa000 , " Weintraub said , grinning . " Arf . Arf . " When they left , she shook hands with Louisa and kissed her tenderly on the cheek . Louisa blushed . Almost everybody else was gone by now . " Do you think we 'll ever see her again ? " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Harry said and laughed . " If I were she I would n't be able to show my face here again , " Louisa said , and blushed . " But you 're not her , " I said . " I suppose if Weintraub brings her again , she 'll come . But would you invite her ? " " Well , of course , " Louisa said , looking alarmed . " I could n't not . " I made my own goodbys and left to walk home along the quiet quai , for once not drunk . The next day was Monday , and the students occupied the reopened Sorbonne as they had threatened and promised . I went over there with a friend from Life to look at it . It was like a five-ring circus . The next day was the big strike and march all around Paris and I stood in my darkened , electricity- , water- , and gas-less apartment and watched the workers and students crossing the Pont de la Tournelle with their furled banners , on their way to the Place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ completely given up trying to work . Then on Wednesday night an " unruly mob " of students sallied forth from their bastion at the Sorbonne and down the rue Racine and rue de Vaugirard and occupied the Theatre de ! ' Odeon , after thep141performance of the Paul Taylor American dance troupe finished . And I understood what Hill had meant on the phone when he hinted they might occupy something else . The Odeon was occupied in the name of the students ' new " Cultural Revolution " . " Our typical luck , " a member of the Paul Taylor troupe was quoted as saying in the paper . Now they would not get to finish their engagement . " Most places they do n't want us because we 're too avant-garde . Here we 're out because we 're too bourgeois . " In all those days none of us saw Sam Everton , or Weintraub.  |p143ON  WEDNESDAY THE 2000 workers of the Sud-Aviation aircraft constructionplant at Nantes seized and occupied their factory . They held the plant manager and his chief assistants prisoner in their offices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not a permitted legal one . In France the law is that strikers must give five days notice , and get the permission of the Government and police before they strike . And on Thursday , although we did not know it until the evening papers came out , a number of the nationalized Renault plants were seized and occupied . Renault was the biggest automobile-maker in France . And since being nationalized , it had had one of the best records in labor relations in the country . In spite of that , a sparepartsplant of 4500 workers at Cleon in Normandy was occupied in the late night hours . Then later Thursday morning the i i , 000-worker assembly plant at Flins , near Paris , was taken over . Later in the day plants at Le Mans , at Sandouville near Le Havre , and at BoulogneRillancourtin the Paris suburbs were struck and seized . It was on Thursday that Harry Gallagher called me and invited me to lunch with him at Lipp and afterward walk over and take a look at the Sorbonne . I had already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Press Card of my friend from Life was required to get us in . But nowp144the kids had thrown it wide open , to any citizen who wanted to come and see . I did not mind going again . Especially with Harry , knowing how ambivalent he felt about Hill . We walked to Lipp from his apartment , taking the footbridge to the other island , crossing the cite behind Notre-Dame , and heading right on up the rue des Bernardins to Place Maubert : the exact same route I had taken a week ago the Thursday before . Place Maubert when we came out into it was still a mess . But it was being cleaned up , the burnt-out cars had disappeared , and a crew of Italian specialists were re-laying the paving stones ripped up by the student rioters . This was still back before somebody in the Governmentdecided to replace the ripped-up paving stones with asphalt . We stopped a minute to watch them work . They were beautiful to watch . The men who laid the stones worked on their knees or else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Each master stone-layer had two apprentice workers , one who kept him supplied with two creeping piles of the stones on his right and left which moved slowly forward with him as he worked . The other prepared and smoothed continually with a shovel the bed of sand on which the stones were laid , afterward throwing and sweeping in the sand that filled the minute spaces between the stones . Every so often the stone-supplier , usually a youth , would reject and throw out to the side a stone that was either too large , too small or too unevenly hewn . He would throw out about one stone in seven . But the stones he passed were not at all all that evenly matched , and that was where the miracle came in . The master stone-layer , without ever bothering to look at it , would reach behind him for a stone , heft it , heft it maybe several times , toss it so that another face of the roughly squared stone came down in his palm , perhaps toss it again , looking quickly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in front of him for laying the next stone . Then he would place it , smoothing and adjusting with his other hand the already smooth sand under it  --  and it would fit . Occasionallyhe would heft a stone and then toss it aside and pick up another . They worked amazingly fast , 15 to 20 seconds to lay a stone . Inches away right beside them just beyond the tapes which protected them the reinstituted traffic whirred down the one-way Boulevard toward the river on the surface of paving stones that had already been replaced.  |p145Beside  me , Harry gave me a look of appreciation and admiration , and I nodded . We walked on up the Boulevard under the shade trees . I was thinking . The paves of Paris were really something special . Made of some grayish speckledly stone that looked like granite , and maybe was , they were roughly squared off into cubes of somewhere between four and five inches and they weighed roughly five to six pounds each . The identical scene to what we had just witnessed must have been viewed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laid in concentricarcs which never got any smaller , and which blended in with the other rows of arcs beside them in a way that it was difficult for the eye to follow . None of that had changed since the Middle Ages . When it was wet and raining , they gave back an oily , iridescent , rainbow look with all the colors of the spectrum . The skill , and simple endurance , required to lay them like that were phenomenal . One of the almost lost arts . I was thinking it would be a shame to see them all replaced someday in Paris with the sticky-in-the-heat , evil-smelling modernity of asphalt . But during and after the May Revolution that was just exactly what they did in the Quartier Latin . Along the shady , dust-smelling Boulevard the sites of other fights and barricades were plainly evident . Where it junctioned with the Boul ' Mich ' at the Carrefour was of course always one of the big fights , and it looked truly beat up there . Six big camions of the CRS were parked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trees and grass of the Musee de Cluny . But there had been another at the carrefour of the rue Danton in front of the Ecole de Medecine , and just beyond it still another at the Carrefour Odeon . It was like that all the way up to the Place St.-Germain . There were other camions of CRS placed strategically around , the men in them playing cards , smoking , reading newspapers , or laughing and talking . But the streets were literally alive with kids , most of them with long hair , all of them laughing and strolling , and happy warmth and excitement on their faces . None of them were belligerent ; rather the reverse . About two-thirds of them seemed to be wearing red shirts . Lots of others wore red bandannas . And in all the little ye-ye clothes shops around the rue de Seine and rue du Four ( Street of the Oven , in English ) the red motif had been picked up and showed conspicuously in the display windows : red shirts. , red slacks , red socks , red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ riding the bandwagon of the Revolution . We crossed the dusty , litter-blown Place with the light . Then we worked our way through the usual press of people , mostly youngsters , outside the popular Drugstore St.-Germain . Brasserie Lipp was just next door . Across the street on the sunny side the famous Deux Magots and Cafe Fiore squatted dusty under the trees in sunshine , their sidewalk tables spilling out almost to the curb . There were more American tourists this summer than anyone had expected . Maybe they had come to see and to photograph the Revolution . Lipp was crowded with lunchers . At the revolving-door entrance , which had been opened back in the warm summer weather , " young " Monsieur Cazes , the owner , met us , told us we would have to wait . But he gave me a look that said though there were others in front of us he would slip us in ahead . We sat down at an outside table and ordered the big schooners of beer which are called un serieux at Lipp . Here on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It will be interesting to see what it is like over there , " Harry said after his first long pull , and wiped the foam off his lip . " The Sor-bonne . " " Yes , " I said . " And I 'll be interested to make a comparison to what it was like the first day . " So we sat and watched the faces and stances of the people passing in the street for a while , always one of the best of the fringe benefits of Paris outdoor cafe sitting . " Young " Monsieur Gazes came and got us before our beers were even half finished and I told the outdoor waiter to put them on the bill inside . There were a number of dirty looks thrown at us by the other people waiting . But Monsieur Cazes , " young " Monsieur Cazes , who was aged about 56 , only eyed them blandly with a cold smile . As a matter of fact , he was not the " young " Monsieur Cazes any more . Although we all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " old " Monsieur Gazes , ever since his father the original " old " MonsieurCazes , a tough white-haired very bourgeois old gent , had died in the spring of that year . There was no " young " Monsieur Cazes now , because the new " old " Monsieur Cazes had no son.  |p147We  followed him inside and through the crowded tables , nodding or waving at various literati or movie people we knew . They never took reservations at Lipp . But if Monsieur Cazes knew you , and considered you adequate , there was always a place . I can not say that it was I who introduced Harry Gallagher to Lipp . He had been there before . But it was I who introduced him into its inner sanctum by introducing him to " old " Monsieur Cazes , and to the then " young " Monsieur Cazes . I had been coming there the ten years I had been in Paris , and had been introduced myself by Romain Gary . Once they knew who I was and what I did , and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I became one of the special clients , of which there could not have been more than one or two thousand . I do not think any of them ever read much , though I may be wrong about that , or ever had time much to go to the movies ; but they took very seriously , and with about equal importance , their literary and their film-world clienteles . It was an old tradition , going back to Fitzgerald and Hemingway and Edith Wharton and Cocteau in the Twenties , and even before that . It went back even to before the turn of the century . And its decor had not been changed since then , either . Since I introduced him , Harry had taken to coming there more than I had ever come and now was better known there than I ever was . Harry had really taken the place up . The waiters always dressed in black tuxedo-like suits and aprons and black bow ties from an earlier day . They all wore numbered metal checks on their lapels which signified strictly their proper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a very jealously guarded thing . The most recent Number One had died about two years ago and the new Number One , who had been wearing the Number Two check since I had first come to Paris , was a tiny roly-poly man about as wide as tall , with white hair which stood out from his head and the flushed , veined nose and cheeks of a dedicated red wine drinker . He wheezed when he moved and seemed almost too feeble to work at all , but the others all seemed to help him out almost religiously . " NumCro Unol " Harry called out , when the head waiter Monsieurp148Gazes had passed us to usher us into the back room . And Number One came trotting over to shake hands , his eyes almost disappearing behind his red cheeks . It was a big act Harry and I always did when either one of us came to Lipp . It helped preserve our much-liked Americanism . " M'sieu ' Artley , M'sieu Gallag-her , " Number One grinned . " Ease good toe zee hyou . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put my name first because he had known me the longest and respected seniority everywhere , even though Harry was now more of an habitue than I was . " Comment ca va , Numero Uno ? " Harry cried . " Very finne , very finne , " the old man beamed . When we were seated against the wall it was waiter Number Fifteen who waited on us . The rest of the place was like its waiters . By stepping through the door you might have stepped back into the year 1900 . There were no tables in the center of the floor in the back , only a big serving cabinet , which held the napkins and the bread and condiments and silverware : les converts . The waiters continually clustered around it to get their serving stuff . The electric light fixtures looked like they should be gaslights . Each wall was decorated with a three-foot mirror above the seatbacks , and if you craned your neck you could see the lights and the mirror and the people reflected and re-reflected almost to an infinity . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ highly colored tiles which represented plants . The front was almost exactly like the back except that it was wider and a waist-high wood partition ran down the center making it two rooms . One side was for coffee and drinking only . The other side was for eating . Along its top was a slightly raised plate of glass , so that people could talk under it to each other and see who all was there . Upstairs on the first floor was still another Salle , but nobody went there except the unknowns . The plat du jour for Thursdays was always fricandeau de veau roti , and cassoulet maison . On Fridays there was brandade de morue and raie au beurre noir . On Saturdays and Sundays there was boeuf gros sel and gigot d'agneau . Sole meuniere and choucroute garnie were standard daily items . Harry ordered Baltic herring which was served with sliced onionsp149and whole peppercorns in a vinaigrette , and the cassoulet . I did not feel my stomach was up to a cassoulet , which was a delicious dish of various meats and sausages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ served in an earthenware casserole but a little hard to assimilate . I loved it , but I ordered a boeuf museau vinaigrette and afterward a steak and pommes frites . We had another schooner of beer with the first course , and a bottle of Bordeaux with the entree . But in the end we drank two bottles of the Bordeaux . We must have known at least half of the people sitting in the crowded back room . " No Revolution here , " Harry said and grinned , as we were served the herring and the museau . " No , " I said , " but they 've had their hard times just the same . They 've been through the troubles of ' 36 , when M. Pompidou himself was on the student barricades . They 've had two World Wars , and an Occupation . As well as the time of the Existentialists right after , which must never be discounted . " " Well , may this bastion never fall ! " Harry said , and raised his big beer glass . I answered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever tell you about the time I was having lunch here and Louisa came in ? " Harry said . I lied . " No . " " Well , " Harry said , " I was having lunch here with Zanuck and Ed Leggewie . About some screenplay job or other . And Louisa came in with this Canadian playwright friend of ours who happened to be in town . Well , we were sitting at that end table up front , right by the caisse . The head waiter  --  him  --  that little one , yeah , with the straight white hair  --  he got hold of Louisa and whispered to her , Madame , Madame , Monsieur est la ! ' She did n't know what he meant , of course . But he said it again . Madame , Madame , Monsieur est la ! ' He was warning her . He thought she was out to lunch with a lover , and that she had stumbled onto me by mistake . Now , how 's that for French politesse ? " I had heard it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a funny story . It was very French , I suppose . But it was funny . I laughed , and then Harry laughed too , but there was a sort of anxious look on his face also . When Harry was anxious his forehead got wrinkled like a wash- board . I thought he had remembered in mid-story that he had told it to me before . " That little girl 's been calling me , " he said suddenly . " What little girl ? " " That Sam . Samantha . Samantha-Marie . " " What ? " I said . " No . Come on . You 're kidding me . " " No , " he said , " I 'm serious . Quite serious . She 's called me five times since she and Weintraub were at the house Sunday . " " What does she want ? " I said . " Outside of your money ? " " Me , " Harry said . " Apparently , she wants me . " I think then I suddenly realized what was the purpose of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do with the Sorbonne . " Well , Harry , what do you want me to tell you ? " I said . Probably I said it too sharply . In my middle-age I have become very short-tempered with people asking me for personal advice . I do not know where they get off thinking I know enough to give them any . I have found that the truth is personal advice is not at all what they want . What they really want is reassurance . And if you give them that , they are as often as not likely to come back and throw it in your face later , and tell you that whatever it was that they did was all your fault . " I do n't want you to tell me anything , jack , " he said . " I want you to be a witness , that 's all . " " Witness ? " I said . " Witness to what ? I do not intend to be anybody'switness to any God damned personal junk . " " Witness to the fact that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Not any at all . I know what I am , I know where I stand , I know what is good for me , and furthermore I know what I really want . I think I know where I 've been . And I 'm making you my witness . " That was pretty hard to refuse . In fact , it was not possible to refuse it , under the circumstances . I had been impressed , like a sailor . Once he stated it , like that , I was already committed , simply because my ears had heard it . And anyway , under those circumstances , I did not want to refuse . " Okay , " I said . " I 'm your witness . I fail to see how I can not be . Under the circumstances . Now what ? " " Now nothing , " lie said . " Let 's go sec the fucking Sorbonne. "  |p151We  had about finished the herring and museau by this time . Our waiter Number Fifteen was hovering around waiting to serve the entrees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , gentlemen , " he said in French , " I would like to offer very much the suggestion that you also pass by and view the Odeon . It is not possible that you could not find it amusing . " I thanked him . When he served Harry his cassoulet , I regretted my decision not to order it . But I stuck with my steak . We ate the rest of the meal without talking much , mostly nodding or saying hello to people we knew who came in or got up to leave . " Do not forget to pass by and view the Odeon , " Number Fifteen called , after we paid and were leaving . That was what we did . The easiest way to get to it was to walk back down the Boulevard we had come up , to the Carrefour Odeon , and turn up there , away from the river . It was pleasant strolling along under the shade trees , with the excited kids all around . " I thought it was Louisa she was after , " 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beside me . " But maybe that was just a ploy . Anyway , that 's a joke ! " When we turned up , the whole crazy place was visible way off , straight up the rue de l'Odeon , in the Place de l'Odeon , where the famous fish restaurant La Mediterranee nestled on a warped corner of the Place . The theater itself was called the Theatre de France but everybody spoke of it as " the Odeon " . It had been built by Louis Quinze in the eighteenth century , 1751 or somewhere around there , then was burned in the Revolution and later restored . It had a huge colonnaded facsade with the columns running four or five low stories up to the pediment , very Greek copy , with low , thick , arched arcades you could walk under running around the other three sides . It was a big building with lots of storage rooms and dressing rooms backstage around in the back which hutted on the rue de Vaugirard , and just across the street were the I.uxernbourg Gardens . Now two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the breeze from the very top of the pediment , the tricolor had been hauledp152down , and the entire roof appeared to be alive with unkempt kids swarming around , or just standing , or sitting on the cornice eating their lunch of bread and meat or bread and cheese . Huge banners had been fastened to the big columns just under the architrave . " Imagination takes power at the Theatre de l'Odeon . " Another said " Barrault is dead , " referring to the theater director 's own quote about himself on Wednesday night when he joined the invading students . Another said " FREE ENTRY " . The students intended to throw the stage and pit open to a perpetual dialogue that would go on 24 hours a day every day , everybody invited . Apparently this had already started , and lots of workers , waiters and petits commercants appeared to be taking advantage of the invitation . Up closer , we saw somebody had painted a smaller banner : " When the Assemblee Nationale becomes bourgeois theater , the Bourgeois Theater must become the Assemblee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ performances in front of the Assemblee at the beginning of the week . The whole Place was alive with people , not all of them students by any means , and discussions , dialogues and arguments were going on all around . No auto traffic could have gotten through it . Commercants argued with waiters , waiters argued with students , students argued with commereants , commercants argued with commercants . A TV group was filming it all from the top of their truck . Coming up , the sidewalks and the street itself were jammed with students and other people grinning or laughing and going to or coming from the Place , but there had been no jostling . The whole place was wild , laughing , scratching crazy . " Do you want to try to get in ? " I shouted at Harry . The entire huge porch beneath the great columns was jammed with a mob of people , all evidently trying to get inside to hear the dialogue in the pit . " No , " he shouted back . " We 'd never make it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heading for the rue Racine , which would take us to the Sorbonne . It had the same look as the rue de l'Odeon had had . The Boulevard St.-Michel when we came out into it had a soberer ,  |p153saner  look . We walked up it toward the Place de la Sorbonne . This of course was crowded with knots of kids . So were all the cafes along it . " Well , Number Fifteen was certainly right , " I said . " About Odeon . " Harry nodded . " He sure was . Great sport . But there 's going to be a big bill . I just wonder if anybody is thinking about who 's going to pay that big bill when it is presented . " This sobered me down a little . " Well , I guess they will all have to pay a part . " " They will , " Harry said , " yes . Because the Government and the Patronat sure as hell ai nt going to . " The word patronat translated means " body of employers " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just about the same as our word Establishment , except that it is probably a little more precise in who it means . Everybody knew , at least every American did , just how antiquatedthe French Patronat was in comparison to our equally unloved American Establishment . It was about a hundred times worse , in just about every sense . It had hardly changed at all since Karl Marx started taking the Industrial Revolution to task . Their capitalism was still of the circa 187o variety . Their Stock Exchange even , the Bourse , still worked by secrecy and hidden buying , without open declaration . Comparatively speaking , they were taxed almost not at all . And as a result the comparative richness between them and the French worker was enormously greater . Whoever lost in this " Revolution " , it would almost certainly not be the Patronat . " Well , it 's the people 's vacation , " I said , a little lamely , but Harry did not answer . The Sorbonne , when we got to it , looked about the same as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that now everything looked a little dirtier . The streets and sidewalks outside were covered with litter : mimeographed pamphlets , tracts , mimeographed single-sheet announcements , candy bar wrappers , old cigarette packs . But the students were apparently trying to organize a clean-up group , because we saw a number of them wearing some kind of unreadable armband and carrying brooms . A few of them were sweeping away at the mess , but most were talking . We went in from the rue Victor Cousin side . Inside , the famous court looked like some kind of Persian market . Booths made of card tables or old refrigerator boxes had been set up all over the place . Here the outside theme of increasing litter and dirtiness was continued , in trumps , but here nobody was trying to do anything about it . Each booth it turned out was the station of some particular political persuasion . There were Maoists , Che Guevaraists , Stalinists , Leninists , Trotskyists , and I do n't know what all . Huge portraits of Lenin , Mao and Guevara had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in red paint just about everywhere . " Society is a carnivorous flower , " said one . " I take my desires for reality , because I believe in the reality of my desire , " another said . They were all over the place . " One pleasure has the bourgeoisie , that of degrading all pleasures . " " Be a realist , demand the impossible . " " Those who make a revolution by halves , dig their own graves . " " A Philistine 's tears are the nectar of the Gods . " " Acid is yellow ! " " Imagination power ! " " Sex power ! " " Cunt power ! " " Commodities are the opium of the people . " There were hundreds of others . A steady stream of youthful corners and goers filed through the courtyard gate and milled about in the yard . Everybody had a happy , laughing , vacationing look . I went over to one booth and asked to buy a copy of L'Enrage , a paper with fairly funny cartoons the Anarchist group had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at me coldly , decided I was not ridiculinghim but was simply not one of the well-informed , sneered at me , and said , " They 're over there . Here we are Trotskyites . We do n't mess with their garbage . " 1 apologized , and sauntered away . 1 did not have the courage to try another booth . Anyway , I could buy the paper on the street in St.-Germain . " Come on , " Harry shouted at me across some heads . " Let 's go see the amphitheaters . " The amphitheaters ( lid not appear to have changed any since Monday . They were jammed right up literally to the rafters , with students sitting on the statues and in the niches in the walls . The " NO SMOKING " signs had been mutilated and made to read " SMOKE ! " ,  |p155as  if it were a general 's command . They could have been exactly the same students that I saw on Monday , and as far as I knew they were , so that I had the strange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bowel movements or any other normal function for the three full days that I had been away . We did not go in but stood in the doorway . Some boy had the gavel up on the stage and while we stood there he recognized some girl with long stringy hair and extremely tight gray corduroy pants , who had some indistinguishable amendmentto make to something . The morning papers had said that the students had already voted to boycott year-end exams , but this group apparently did not know this , had not voted yet and was still discussingthe wording of the proclamation . Bottles of red wine , long loaves of bread and hunks of cheese and sausage passed back and forth from hand to hand . The more or less laughing uproar made such a din it was hard to hear anything that was said . Harry motioned to me and we started away down the crowded , ringing corridor and ran head-on into Hill and some of his friends . I must say they looked pretty grubby . Hill appeared to be starting a beard , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time to shave for some days . Anne-Marie was with them , as was Terri of the long hair , and bearded Bernard , but Hill had his arm well around another girl and it was pretty clear they were lovers , at least for the time being . AnneMariedid not appear to mind , in her militant way . Thin and small as she was , she nevertheless moved along like a sturdy little tank , whose turret gun never stops turning and looking . Even the militantly clean Anne-Marie looked a little grubby . But I understood  --  whether Harry did or not  --  that none of them had had a chance at an honest-to-God bath since the Monday of the occupation , if not since the Friday night battle in the rue Gay-Lussac . I guess Harry did understand it ; about the no-bath beatnik , hippie look . At least , lie played it all very cool . So did Hill . I thought then that Hill was desperately wanting to avoid any big argument with his father in front of his friends . I think Harry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have known that they had ever argued about anything in their lives , looking at them shake hands and say hello . " We just came over to look the Sorbonne over , " Harry smiled . " Butp156I did n't have any idea we might find you here , run right into you in the corridors . " " We 've been sleeping here since Monday night , " Hill smiled back , and he squeezed the little girl he had his arm around and smiled down at her , so that it was pretty obvious with whom he , anyway , had been sleeping since Monday night . " A lot of the kids brought their sleeping bags . It 's not bad at all . " Actually , you probably would n't have found me , " he said , " a day later . We 're moving our Cinema Committee over to the Odeon . It is felt that since we in Cinema are basically cultural it is better for us to be in the headquarters of the Cultural Revolution . Anyway , there 's a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is here in this jammed madhouse . " " We understood the place had been thrown open to the public , " I said apologetically . " So we thought we 'd look in . " We were speaking English and Hill 's new girl suddenly answered , in unaccented American-English . " It has , it has , it has been thrown open . Wide open . To everybody in Paris . Workers , artists , everybody . We want everybody to come . We want to get acquainted with everybody , in a whole new way of life , of living . " " This is Florence , " Hill introduced her . " She 's a new member of our Cinema Committee . " It seemed pretty clear to me why she was a new member of the Committee , and I would have bet 50 dollars with anybody that Hill had certainly been her sponsor . " She 's half-American , " Hill said . " But she was born and raised in France . She only returned from the States a few days ago , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Well , I guess she 's finding out now , though , " Harry smiled . " She sure is , " Hill said , and squeezed her again smiling down . " I 'm loving it , " Florence said . " I 'm about to be elected Chairman of the Students ' Cinema Committeeof the Sorbonne and Odeon , " Hill said . " We 're having the meeting this afternoon , if we can find an empty room . Otherwise , we 'll wait and do it after the move to Odeon . " " Well , I think that 's great , Hill , " Harry said . " So do I , " I said.  |p157The  others stood silently smiling at us that peculiar innocent smile , Terri of the innocent face , and bearded warm-eyed Bernard , all of them except Anne-Marie . It is not true that Anne-Marie did not smile . But her smile , while equally innocent and pleasant , was so superior and openly contemptuous of us " Older Generations " that for me at least it did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smirk . Probably she did not even know it . " But the best news , " Hill said , " the best news , is about the Renault plant at Boulogne-Billancourt . Do n't you think ? We 've had our boys out there talking to them since Saturday , almost a week . And now they 've finally closed up shop and seized the plant . At Flins , too . We are all going to march out to Boulogne-Billancourt late this afternoon and hold a solidarity meeting with the Renault workers in front of the gates . " " Do you think that 's wise ? " Harry said , pleasantly enough . " What about the police ? " " Strike while the iron is hot , " Hill said . " We 've got the whole bunch of them on the run , now . I do n't think the police will bother us . But if they do , so much the better for us and worse for them . " Harry was still smiling . " Come on , Jack , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things to see . We did n't mean to bother you , or upset any of your timing or plans . " " Oh , you did n't bother us , " Hill smiled . " It was good to see you . " He did not offer to shake hands now , and neither did Harry . Hill turned away and with his arm still around his little half-American girl led his group off down the hollering , reverberating corridor . " Dumbass kids , " Harry said , as we started off the other way . " They 're monkeying around with dynamite . It 's one thing to close down a couple of universities . Nobody really gives much of a damn , and nothing much is really hurt . But it 's an entirely different thing to close down all the major industries of France . That 's something else again . They do that and they 're going to find their heads in a noose . " We were almost at the great front door now , that opened onto the rue des Ecoles and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ street . A sandwich , coffee and soup kitchen had been opened up by the students in the big main hall near the front door . You did n't pay . You could contribute if you wanted.  | " I think I'rn going to leave you here , " Harry said suddenly as we went between the columns and down the steps . " I just remembered I 've got a producer-director 's meeting with some guys . Over on the Right Bank . " His face suddenly looked all pinched up . " Anyway , I do n't want to see any more right now . " " Dynamite , " he said again as he left . " Absolute dynamite . " I walked home alone through the buzzing , swarming Quarter . Harry certainly appeared to be right . That night M. Pompidou went on television for the second time . General de Gaulle of course was already in Rumania on his six-day state visit which he refused to cancel , had left in fact on Tuesday . He would address the nation in a few days , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of us watched it , the same gang of Americans , at the Gallaghers ' apartment . There was no placating of the students this time , and in fact the speech was announced only 90 minutes before the Prime Minister spoke . It appeared the whole Government had become first terrified , then furious at the prospect of the workers closing down their factories and following the students . M. Pompidou declared that he was prepared to use force if necessary to stem the student rebellion , to keep it from spreading to French industry . " This Government will do its duty , " he said . " Its duty is to defend the Republic . It will defend it . And this time the Government tried a new wrinkle , one which appeared to be caused by desperation , and which also appeared to have backfired . The Government permitted the student leaders on TV for the first time . For maybe 15 minutes before M. Pompidou spoke the three boys , Sauvageot , Dany Cohn-Bendit and Alain Geismar held a dialogue with a group of Government-selected correspondents , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good humor and good sense . Cohn-Bendit was especially good . He had a particular charisma . You could not help but like him . " We just do not like the society which we are forced to live in , " he said over and over , smiling . " We just do not want to live like that any more . " That was the first time that that particular student theme was ever given public voice , as I remember . And after them the Prime Minister seemed very anticlimactic . I looked over at Harry over the heads of the others , and he nodded.  | " This could mean anything , " he told me later privately at the pulpit bar . " Those kids beat him hands down . It could mean a generalized nation-wide illegal strike by everybody  --  and a continuing one , without any time-limit for stopping . The Unions have completely lost control over their younger element . But for God 's sake , do n't tell Louisa . " I walked home alone that night very thoughtfully . Neither Weintraub @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either.  |p161MY  MISTRESS CALLED ME and came by that Thursday evening of the 16th . I was relieved that she did . I did not have a dinner date that night . And I did not feel like going out and dining alone in some restaurant . The French are excessively rude about staring at lone diners . Somehow it seems to menace them , and they are n't careful about hiding their disapproval . Normally I am quite capable of handling this and am good at staring coldly back , but tonight I was pensive and I did n't feel up to it . Neither did I feel like slapping something together and wolfing it down at home alone . I was feeling low and depressed . It was one of those lag periods , one of those spells that come , when a bachelor 's life does n't seem all that good after all and you are inclined to start asking yourself what the hell it all means , and what the hell is it really worth ? That was no kind of mood to have living alongside the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quai streetlights . And yet I knew I would be drawn helplessly to my windows , to stare at it , and its dark , masked , massive indifference to my death . It was going to be that kind of night . So I was glad she called . Besides , I had been wanting to ask her what she thought about what was going on . Martine was sort of my barometer about everything French : economic ; social ; political . I had never known her to be wrong.  | She had for example predicted to me several weeks in advance le Generalde Gaulle 's vicious attack on the dollar . Through this I was able to make myself a small piece of change on the Bourse through my illegal money man Monsieur Jardin . Naturally I was anxious to know what she thought about the Revolution . But our ground rules were that I was never to call her ; never , under any circumstances . She was always to call me . I could hear the phone ringing as I came up the one flight of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get it . A few minutes , and I might very easily have missed her . " Yes ? " " Cheri ? " " Martine ! I 've been wondering  --  " " I can not talk now , " she said guardedly . " But you will be home tonight ? Yes ? You do not have one other date ? No ? " " No . I do n't have . But if I had , I 'd cancel it . I  --  " " I can not talk now , " she said again . " I will come at nine-fifteen . I will cook tonight . I bring everything . He has to be out for Ministerial affairs . By-by , Cheri . " I started to say goodby but the phone had already clicked dead in my ear . I sat and stared at it a while . I certainly did want to see her about the Revolution . And my cafard , my fear and hate of the river were quite suddenly gone . The river could be very romantic , even gay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm apparently a low-keyed man sexually . That is to say , I can take it or I can leave it alone . It does not really bother me when I do n't have it , as it does some people . I was that way even when I was young . But I had n't seen Martine in over two weeks . And Martine had a private special habit of always cooking in her underwear . I contemplated the empty telephone and thought about this with considerable pleasure . The reason she did it was purely practical . She did it to protect her wardrobe . She spent almost every dime she had on her clothes , and she took a great deal of thought and care with her outfits . She was not about to get grease spots on some thing , not even on a robe de chambre . She was not about to have her things permeated with cooking smells . So she cooked , at my place anyway , in her underwear.  |p163I  did n't care what the reason was . I enjoyed watching the result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She had a fine behind , and lovely breasts . She also wore her high-heeled shoes , on her bare feet , after carefully taking off her stockings . Apparently she seemed to feel grease spots would not seriously hurt her Mancini shoes . And kitchen floors are sticky . Somehow the shoes added quite a flair to the whole thing . Do n't ask me why , but they did . And I was the observer . I would pull a chair around , and sit in my living room , and watch her , down the short hallway , concocting whatever dish it was she was making . Once in a while , rarely , she would turn her head from where she bent over the oven and peer at me with an amused smile and say , " Et toil Et voila , toil " She preferred to keep her cooking and her sex separate . She was truly a fabulous cook . Why she originally took up with me I have never figured out . I once asked her this and she grinned that funny , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That is why , Jean . " She always called me Jean , French-style . I sort of got the point , which was not flattering , but it never really answered my question . She was a blonde Southerner , Martine . There is a race of them . God knows where they came from , maybe their origin is Tuscan , but they have the aquiline nose and same high cheekbones as the dark ones , only their skin is fair and their hair blonde . Even their body hair is blonde . It makes a striking contrast  --  I mean , that Roman nose and cheekbone with all that blonde skin and hair . And they were just as tough-headed as the dark Southerners , when it came to bargaining or buying . Maybe even tougher , if that 's possible . I had met her at a literary cocktail at Magdalen McCaw 's , a type of function she absolutely never went to . But Maggie 's husband George , who was with O.E.C.D. , had had to pay off some social debts to minor Government people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well , friend . God only knows why he brought Martine instead of his wife . Maybe he thought Maggie and George , Maggie being such a famous American lady writer , were Bohemians  --  which only shows how little he knew Maggie . I must say , Martine stood out at that literary cocktail . She was tall , statuesque , broad shouldered , big breasted , wore lots of eye make-up , and she was blonde , long-haired blonde  --  all that blondeness on onep164whose features openly proclaimed that she ought to be dark like a Mediterranean type . She looked immensely sexy there . There just was n't anybody at that literary cocktail like her . Or at any other Paris literary cocktail I have ever been to . Within five minutes after I started talking to her she had written down secretly my phone number . All around her were people like Maggie , with her hair skinned back , and her toothy smile , which I have always found innocent and charming , though many others have called it sharklike . The males were at about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , hirsute , pipe-sucking . Why she picked me I have never found out . It could just as well have been one of the others . " Do not call me , " she warned . " I will call you . " Three days later she called me to make our first sexual assignation . Her lover , the man whose mistress she was , was a banker , a wealthy banker . But he also had some kind of hush-hush function or other , that I never clearly understood , with the Government . Her lover : I guess I must call him that : he paid her bills and apartment : I certainly did n't : I was more or less her " mister " , since it was she who spent money on me  --  at least when she cooked for me :  --  Anyway , her lover would pass on to her bits of sometimes important Government informationfor her to use to aid herself , and she would in turn pass these on to me . Like that thing about de Gaulle 's attack on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on . But it was more than that . There was something about her , somethinghard and cold-blooded and sharply French , in that hard-hearted , no-nonsense , tough-minded French way , that seemed to make her know beforehand what France and the French were going to do at any given period or moment . And she could predict them . I 've always felt that maybe her life she had lived accounted for this strange predictive quality she had about the French . She had had an oddly comic if , for her , not very happy life and set of experiences in her 32 years . I think I would have called it laughable , if it were someone else than Martine , somebody I did n't know . She had come from a small town in the South . It 's hard to believe how primitive and backward and set in their ways most of those towns can be . Her people were petits commercants , and at 16 her parents had farmed her out asp165mistress to one of the local richies . This was natural enough , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young man , a spoiled brat apparently , had treated her badly . So she had secretly saved everything he gave her , trading presents in for cash at another town nearby , and swiped a bit more from her folks until she had enough to cut and run for Paris . This had taken her three years . In Paris she had modeled a little , drifted into the boutique world , first as receptionist , then as head saleswoman , then into the managerial side , and there she met the man who became her first official Paris lover and took her officially as his mistress . He too had been a rich banker , and in fact was a good friend of her present banker . With him , the first banker , she had done very well . Unfortunately , five years ago he had died of a heart attack quite suddenly . He had never put her apartment in her own name . Hardly any of them ever did , she told me . It made it too expensive to change mistresses . The result was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but led by the wife , had moved in immediately and locked her out of her apartment . Everything she owned in the world except the clothes on her back was in it : all her expensive outfits : her jewelry he had given her : her shoes : make-up : everything . His wife , the widow , through her lawyers , claimed it all , and the courts awarded it all to her . Martine did not seem to feel that there was anything personally vindictive in the widow 's action , but rather that it was a normal piece of hard-headed French business . In the wife 's place , she would have clone the same . She had had a rough time of it for some weeks , but several girlfriendshad helped out with small loans . After that there had been a series of men , a lot of them Americans in Paris for a few weeks or months on business , but none of these had seen fit to invest more in her than a few presents , dates with her and dinners . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , depending on where they stayed . Finally she went back to a job as a receptionist and assistant manager of an haute couture boutique . She could n't really expect to model any more . And it was here that she was found by her other rich banker , the close friend of her first rich banker , who used to have dinner with them with his own former mistress . He took her up at once . He had always coveted her , it turned out . She had been with him since.  |p166Now  however she was taking better care of herself . She now kept a good deal of her clothes outfits in a storage place , to which only she had the key . She kept only about one-third of her clothes at her apartment , and exchanged these with others at the storage place twice a week . She allowed herself to keep only one-fourth of her jewelry at home , but exchanged it frequently with the rest which was kept in a safety-deposit box in her name in a bank . She still of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But she now had her own bank account , to which she kept adding small sums whenever she could . You had to admit it was sort of a comic story , in a kind of sorrowful , sad way . She would accept absolutely no presents from me , let alone gifts of cash . And usually when she came to my place she bought all the food on the way and brought it with her to cook and had paid for it herself in the market . And that was the way she arrived that night of the Thursday of the 16th . When the bell rang and I opened the door , she was hardly visible at all behind two huge sacks of groceries , plus two large net panniers , one dangling from each hand , plus her little overnight bag . " Here , " she said . " For the God 's sake , take these . " I helped her get them all down somewhere , then helped her get it all into the kitchen . " I have worried much over you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other of the bedroom cubicles , where she preferred to hang her clothes than among my closely packed hangers in my closet . " For more than one week . But his wife went to the country . To visit relatives , you understand . Because of the troubles . So he comes to me every night . He can not go , of course . He has much to do for the minister of his . But you , you have the much to do too , to sais , darrling . " There is no way to write the lilting way she said darling with the French " r " . She unfastened her lacy garterbelt and sat down on the bed to carefully remove her stockings , and then put back on her shoes . " I will tell you about the all of it when we are eating . " I do not remember in great detail what she made that night . She started with mushrooms , the champignons de Paris , cooked and browned in their own brown sauce , and served in little pastry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then heated in my oven with their filling in them . It was a simple enough dish , but God how good she could make it taste.  |p167As  a main course she made something out of thin strips of beef all cooked up with strips of pimentos and green peppers , a dish she said she had learned from a Brazilian cook she had once had . With it she served mashed potatoes , but pureed in the French way , not dry American-stylemashed potatoes . When she had all that ready , and could safely leave it in the oven hot to serve , she went into the second bedroom cubicle and got from her overnight bag her striped floor-length housecoat , which was slit on both sides all the way to her waist , and for this she took off the panties and put on red and gold Moroccan slippers . It must have been some kind of Moroccan or Arab material , and a long sleeveless vest of the same stuff cunningly half-hid the waist-high slits . She served us in that . I do n't remember what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we had a salad . I do n't know what we had for desert . " You must understand the most carefully what I will now tell you , Cheri , " she said conversationally after we had begun to eat . " I have worried for you ten days more than this . But what happened to now is not even something . Now it will begin really . We have had the word . Most serious word . Very dependable . Tomorrow or Saturday , Sunday and Monday everybody , all of France will be making the strikes . You will not have much time , so you must do exactly what I tell to you . The railroads , all the transportations , the gasoline , the oil , all the industrials and manufactures , the Metro , even the garbage men . They will all make the strikes soon . " She forked up a bite of the Brazilian meat dish and chewed it daintily , if lustily . " It is good , this dish , no ? " She waved her fork at me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the students now . They are angry . How long this will be , I do not know . But it will be for some time , believe me . These will not be strikes of protestations that will stop in two , three days . They are really angry , the French people . They are angry with the police for beating the children in the st rcet as last Friday . And they are angry with the General de Gaulle for letting it happen , when by lifting one finger he could have stopped it before the beginning . " Also they are tired , the people . They love de Gaulle , he is their great hero , but they are tired of him now . They are bored with him . You must remember they get bored easy , the French people . They are bored with his kind of sacrifice pour la 1'alrie which asks the people and workers to sacrifice while the Patronat sacrifices by buying more old chateaux and changing their grounds into beautiful private parks for themselves and relatives . " France @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rich country , in the ground , in the agriculture . And especially now it seems to be a rich country . But it is not a rich country . It could be such a one : more things are coming in , more things are being made , more money is floating in the air . But the price of living is going up swiftly and the workers ' wages are not going up in the same speed . The difference , a not inconsiderable sum , is going in the pockets of the nouveaux riches of the new and the old Patronat . " Too , you must remember we are a race of anarchists . Maybe the last left . Periodically for no reason we want to change . It is some kind of mass hysterical . Do not forget that we still keep the louis d'or in the mattress . And we do not complain of the bruises caused by this , or the lack of good sleep . " And now the people are tired , of all this , and they are what you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just sit down . They will refuse to work or do anything , just like the students are . " Now what you must do , Cheri . . . And she began to tell me . With great precision and in the greatest detail she laid out for me exactly what I must do to ride out the coming siege . It was going to be the worst time in France since the Second World War . It would not become civil war , she thought . But it would be bad enough . First , I must get in plenty of staples . I must buy flour , sugar and salt . A stock of honey was good to have . I must absolutely get to my bank and lay by as large a stock of cash francs as I could withdraw . I must buy plenty of soap , both for the bath and for the kitchen . And candles . Lots of candles were going to be a necessity during the electricity strikes . Lay in plenty of cigarettes and whisky . Any mail I wanted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goods of all varieties would always be useful in such a situation . Since I was a member of the American Commissary , I could get all these cheaper than in the large French stores like Samaritaine or Inno 's . She had figured it all out perfectly , down to the slightest detail of my life . I should not to try to buy all these things at once in the same store.  |p169Go  to different shops . Buy in small amounts . Go first to stores where I was known . Then go to stores where I was less known , or not known at all , which naturally would be less friendly to me , and therefore more suspicious . While she lectured me on all of this , we had finished eating . Still lecturing me , she cleared the dishes away , then made us each an espresso on the little one-cup , one-handle Cornocafe espresso machine like all the big five- and six-handle ones used by all the better cafes , and which she had advised me to buy . After she served the coffee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from her splitlengthhousecoat into her green robe de boudoir while I poured us brandies . When she came back down the little hallway with the light from the kitchen behind her , you could see entirely through the robe , even to the spiky shadows between her legs of her body hair . After the brandies , we adjourned to my bedroom . I suppose that we did just about everything that two people do together when making love to each other . Martine was very experienced . When she left , carrying the little nightcase , she did not wake me . But I came awake enough myself to see by my watch dial that it was one forty-five A.M. I snuggled down , and fell back into sleep , peacefullyand happily.  |p171IN  THE NEXT TWO DAYS I did everything exactly as Martine had told me . I felt like some kind of spy or undercover agent , but I followed her orders with as much precision as any Marine sergeant ever followed the orders of his commander . The result of all this was that I was not only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American neighbors along the quai . I was even better prepared than the concierges along the block ; which in Paris is really something to be able to say . I even went out and bought up some five-gallon plastic jerrycans , as she had told me , and had them filled with gasoline for my little car . Martine had said this would not become necessary for nearly a week . But since I had the time I went on out and did it . I stored the jerrycans in my portion of the deep cave , which I could lock up securely . This of course was strictly against the law , but so were a lot of things going to be against the law soon , and , in fact , already were . While I was doing all this , I called Harry and told them about my inside information . They did not share Martine 's Gallic pessimism the way I did . Of course , they did n't know her like I did . In fact , they did not know her or about her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . But I was able to help them out later . Martine was absolutely right about the gasoline troubles not comingp172on right away . But , as she also predicted , a lot of other things did , and they came fast . On Friday , while I was doing all my necessary shopping and laying in , French workers all across the country occupied scores of factories . About half of these were in the Communist Party strongholds of the Paris suburbs . The other half were in the provinces . That same day General de Gaulle , with his usual caution and good sense , said , in effect , that he 'd be damned if he would cut short his state visit to Romania for such silly tomfooleries . And on Saturday May 18th the major railroads , the post offices , and the airports began to go . Already by Saturday communications , transportation and production were throttled in a display of strikes that threatened to completely disrupt the entire French enonomic and political structure . Even the radio and television workers , technicians , producers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Quai Kennedy had voted to strike , against the Government 's muzzling of the news . As Martine had correctly predicted , the French people were just " pissed off " . All these strikes were wildcat strikes , and even the Communist Party , grown fat and complacently nonmilitant over the years of its decent cooperation with the Government , was alarmed . It was like a huge snowball rolling downhill gathering momentum , speed and extra weight , and already threatening to turn itself into a real avalanche . And meanwhile , the students continued their strike and occupation of the universities in Paris and the provinces , as well as the Theatre de l'Odeon . They were still marching and fighting in the streets every night , and cordons of police were everywhere . Our by-now quite cohesive American group continued to meet every evening at the Gallaghers , and on Sunday the 19th , when we all met again to slurp up ( that 's the only honest word I can use ) another of Louisa 's curries , Weintraub and Samantha Everton were there . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listened to radio stations Europe Number One and Radio Luxembourg . In the last few days everybody seemed to have bought himself a pocket transistor radio , complete with earplug for use in the restaurants . I think the thing that shocked us all most was the complete stoppage of trans-Atlantic air traffic at Orly . The great lumbering 7o7s , landing and taking off with such precision at two-minute intervals in front ofp173that great new glittering chrome-and-glass terminal , heading out for and coming in from destinations all over the world , were as dependablea part of life , now , as the air they flew through . It was like the old blue-and-white Greyhound bus of your youth , which , in their interiors , I 've got to say they resembled . The railroads were stopped , which we more or less expected . The docks were struck , and no shipping was sailing . But when Orly and the airlines went , and went totally and completely , I think we realized for the first time seriously that we were cut off . The only way out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that only as long as the gas held out . And yet , there was a merry , excited quality about our gathering that Sunday night . As I 've said , it was like those first exciting days of a major war . As for Weintraub and Samantha , they were as merry as the rest . I was interested in observing both of them . I was interested especially because of what Harry 'd told me about her repeated phone calls to him . But she and Weintraub seemed completely with each other , with Sam still holding her old position of master , naturally . In fact , it was as if they had not missed a day with us since the last time we had seen them a week before ; and Sam made absolutely no reference or allusion this last fact ambiguous . He seemed nonplussed . At the bar , alone , he told me he was relieved she had n't , had n't acted up . And yet I thought he was a little piqued . Later , not without a little deliberate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Weintraub . There was never any need to urge Weintraub to talk , about anything . " Yeah , " he said , " we were out of town from Sunday night till Friday morning , " without my having asked him . " That 's why we never showed up . And all Friday and Saturday and today I was with the kids at the Odeon . " " What kids ? " " Hill 's Cinema Committee . By the way , he did n't get elected Chairman . Did you know that ? Some other kid did . " " But if  --  " I started , but stopped . But I do n't think Weintraub even noticed.  |p174He  took a big slug from his drink and sucked at his cigarette . " Oh , boy . You talk about an orgy , " he said . " I never saw no orgy like this , man . And , as you probably know , I made that circuit for a while , in Paris . " I kept my mouth shut . " It was some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't remember . Anyway the chateau was n't in the town , it was way off by itself in some big forest . And talk about chateaus . They could move this one to the Loire Valley and it would not be out of place , believe me , Hartley . I never did find out who owned it . I never even found out who the host was . Maybe there was not any host even . Where that girl gets her contacts I got no idea . But she 's sure got them . You never saw so many  --  there was nothing but socialites and bignamefilm people and bankers and , and God knows what . " Why that kid chooses to stay with me in my little one room pad  --  " Anyway , we stayed there from Sunday night through Thursday night and did not leave for town till Friday morning . " I simply could n't resist . " But if you were out there all that time , how could she make all those phone calls to  --  " I stopped myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Not to you . To old Harry ? Hell , all she had to do was to step into some temporarily vacant room and pick up the phone , man . Life 's freebeesville out there , man . " " How did you know they were to Harry ? " " She told me , " Weintraub said . " Did she tell you what they were about ? " " No . She did n't . I did n't ask her . " There was a slight pause . " How did you know about them ? " " Well , Harry told me . Naturally . What else ? " Weintraub shrugged and slugged back more booze . " She sure is some strange kid . " Another pause . " I asked her about why she chose to stay in my grubby little pad and she said , Weintraub you are naive if you think knowing a few rich orgiasts is going to get me to Israel . She had no desire to become some cat 's property , she said . And nobody was going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that as soon as she got enough loot together she was going to cut for Israel . " " She could hustle for it , " I said sourly . " Sure she could . And knowing her , I certainly ai nt believing thatp175would ever make her feel bad , or guilty . Like I said , I think she 's just having too good a time to want to move on . " I thought it was time I made myself another drink . I certainly had no answer , no riposte , for that . " But let me tell you about the kids , " Weintraub said proudly . I will spare you his dialogue . On the Friday morning after returning he had gone around to the Sorbonne to look up Hill and his group . He was becoming seriously attached to them , and to their ideal . He found they had moved the day before to somewhere in the vast backstageinterior of the Odeon . Sam was at his place , sleeping it all off , so he had gone over there to try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what it was like until you had been in there . In the first place it was so crowded around the entrance by people trying to get into the 24-hour-a-day marathon dialogue in the amphitheateritself that you could hardly get in the place at all . Once you did get in , and up through the marble staircases and columns to the first floor where the red-plush entrances to the old amphitheater itself were , you were completely blocked off from any entrance to the backstagearea by gangs of young toughs , blousons noirs kids , with thick chains hanging around their necks . The chains apparently served as both their badge of office , and as weapons if necessary . They were guards , hired , or at least acquired , by the students . Certainly none of them could pass for University students . In fact , most of them appearednever to have finished primary school , let alone lycee . They were everywhere , and they were adamant about not letting anybody pass who did not have a Laissez-Passer card . Finally Weintraub had got one of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evil grin but an apparently ready sense of humor , to go up into the dim labyrinthine backstage interior and bring down Hill Gallagher , who got him through . And that was how Weintraub finally became a bonafidemember of the Comite du Cinema des Etudiants de la Sorbonne . IIe took out of his pants pocket his permanent Laissez-Passer card and showed it to me . What he finally found when Hill led him up through five or six crowded grubby floors was a tiny room under the eaves crowded with one table-desk , one large refrigerator box containing cans of film , and176 JAMES JONES13 or 14 rather smelly and not well-washed students , all talking at the same time . One of the floors they passed had been set up as a provisory hospital , where young boys and girls in dirty white coats often with bloodstains on them ran in and out saying " Shh ! " to everybody . You could hear the moans and groans of the wounded , presumably students , as you passed it . What the 13 or 14 students were arguing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ French the student patois coupled with a lot of argot made it difficult for him to understand , and besides as soon as he entered he immediately began to sweat profusely which distracted him further . The entire little room , which had only one small skylight , felt like a hot-house for orchid growers . The Chairman who had been elected over Hill , sitting behind the table-desk , was , or claimed to be , a Swiss student and had never been registered at the Sorbonne . He wore round steel-rimmed glasses , and looked and acted like a genuine Commissar . Two doors led off from the small room , in addition to the entrance door . Behind one was apparently a temporary kitchen which had been set up as a place for them to get something to eat occasionally , and beyond the other was a place a few of them at a time at least could snatch some sleep . Weintraub had spent all of Friday , Friday night , most of Saturday and all day today with them . It was on Saturday that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be raided by a flying squad of riot police and had transferred all their cans of shot film out of a rear door and spirited them all to Weintraub 's one-room pad in his pension , where they remained hidden even now . Though , it developed , the police raid did not materialize after all . " I 'm pretty proud of that , " Weintraub grinned at me across Harry 's bar . " They really do trust me , those kids . You ought to come along with me and see it . It 's something to have seen . " " I guess so , " I said . " As a matter of fact , " Weintraub smiled , " I am commissioned by the Committee to request you to come . " " Me ? Really ? But why ? " " Well , I 'm trying to introduce them to certain different stars and directors I know who might help them . Burton . Harrison . And when I mentioned you , the idea was brought up immediately that you mightp177be the right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A lot of them read your Review , you know , " he added as an obvious flattery . I thought about it for a moment . " All right . I 'll come with you one day . I 'd certainly like to see it . When can we go ? " " Why not go tonight ? " Weintraub grinned . He looked around Harry 's crowded living room . " We can go as soon as we leave here . " " Tonight ? " " Sure . Why not ? They 'll all be there . " " What about Sam ? " " She 'll go with us . She 's been going ever since Saturday morning . She 's got her own card . She loves it up there . " He paused to suck at his cigarette , and grinned . " You 're liable to see some pretty strange sights up there . So be prepared . " I looked around Harry 's quiet living room myself . At the moment everybody was drinking and waiting for the curry , whose delicious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Okay . Why not ? What have I got to lose ? " " Not a thing in the world , " said Weintraub cheerfully . " Oh , by the way , I think I better tell you that Hill voted against having the Committee to ask you to come . " That took me back a little . " But , why ? " Weintraub shrugged . " I do n't know . I guess because you 're such a close relative ' , so to speak . I guess he felt it would be like them asking his dad to come help them . " " That irritates me , " I said . " Do n't let it . He was way outvoted . So we 'll go ? After ? " " Yes . " We took a back way route that mounted the rue Cardinal Lemoine and passed up and around the Pantheon . Apparently there was fightingagain tonight at the Carrefour St.-Michel . As we climbed the hill toward Contrescarpe I could still taste Louisa 's curry , and sucked at my teeth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Lots of people were out tonight , and a heady excitement floated on the air . But the Pantheon itself was deserted , and nearly dark . At least seven or eight big camions of CRS were parked square in front of the Pantheon , in the Place there , loaded with men and ready to move . Therep178was a Commissariat on the opposite corner , and uniformed policemen moved in and out the door continually . Every few seconds a helmeted motorcycle cop roared up , or roared away . We took the rue Cujas down the far side . When we crossed the Boulevard St.-Michel to rue Monsieur-le-Prince , we could hear the roar of the fighting , way down at the Carrefour . The street was jammed with people craning their necks and looking . There were no cars . I had seen the Odeon once with Harry on Thursday , but I was totally unprepared for the crowding and hysteria we encountered as soon as we turned into Monsieur-le-Prince off the Place Edmond Rostand . We cut left on Vaugirard , and before we turned back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could see a huge cordon of CRS or Gendarmes Mobiles blocking off the entirety of Vaugirard in front of the building that houses the Senate . The low little walkway under the low thick arches that surrounds the Odeon building was so jammed with exultant students that we kept to the street , but the street was almost as crowded . The great majority of the crowd did not seem to be students . When we got to the great front doors under the colonnade , it was hard to get close enough to the door guard to get admitted . The porch was mobbed by people trying to get into the talkathon in the amphitheater , and a lot of them were socialites . I recognized the Countess Something-or-other , and saw the Baroness de Whatcha-ma-call-it , whom I had met a few times , both of them with fairly large groups , the ladies all in their furs and escorted by tall handsome men in dinner jackets . Preferential treatment was obviously being given to celebrities of this type . Once we were in and up the not-crowded marble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fat muscle-boy , who wore a bight of bicycle chain three feet long with both ends open and dangling near his waist . The armpits of his half-open jersey shirt gave off an odor that spoke of years of insufficiently washed-away sweat still lingering in them . He grinned and let us through when Weintraub explained who I was . " But be sure you get your pal a card for hisself , hunh ? " he called after us in French . On the back stairs and in the corridors , through half-open doors , every cubbyhole and room seemed filled with a committee of studentsp179violently discussing something or other and the cigarette smoke was thicker than fog . The corridor floors were filthy with ash marks and rubbed-out butts on the once-red carpet . But then the whole place looked like it had n't been washed in over a loo years anyway . We were properly " Shh ! " - ed by the dedicated white-coated workers of the hospital , then after two more flights we were in the little room under the eaves already described to me by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so was bearded Bernard , so was Anne-Marie of course , and so was the half-American girl Florence , who for some reason now seemed to have attached herself to Weintraub . Hill was there , too , but after an embarrassed perfunctory handshake he backed off into a corner and said little . The first thing we took care of was my card . With crisp dispatch the Chairman , who was called Daniel , seized a white card and on it wrote : ODEON  --  COMMISSION CINEMA LAISSEZ-PASSER PERMANENT  --  and then looked up at me through his steel-rimmed glasses . I had already been introduced as Monsieur Hartley . " What is your name ? " he asked . " Why , Hartley , " I said . " No . Your first name . " " Jack . " He wrote it JACQUES on the card , in red ink this time , explaining as he did it , " We never use last names here , on anything we write . It is a precaution . It is a safety measure , for you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by any accident fall into the hands of the police , you know . " His French had a slightly strange accent to the ear . He signed it with an illegible flourish and handed it to me and I put it in my left front pants pocket . Like Weintraub . I somehow appeared not to want it in my wallet , with my passport and my credit cards . Then we launched into a hot and heavy and long-winded discussion about my writing the Commentary for the film they wanted to make . Weintraub was certainly right when he said it was hot in there . Would I be interested in writing such a Commentary ? Yes , I certainly would . But I could n't very well write it until I had seen at least rushes , and preferably a finished copy , of the film they would make . Here someone else broke in . Well , of course , that was the trouble at the moment . They had no way of getting developed the film they had already shot.  |p180Whoever  the boy was , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . The police were watching every shop and company that developed film in Paris , both still photos and tine , and any student film that was turned in would certainly be confiscated . Well , I was willing to wait , I let them know . But I certainly could n't write or even begin to write a Commentary for them until I could see some film . And anyway , I pointed out , the Revolution was n't finished yet . Would I be willing to write and print some articles about them and their aims and the aims of the Revolution in my English-language Review ? I was asked . I certainly would , and gladly . They would be willing to give me a boy , or a girl , to work closely with me on them . When did I expect the next issue of my Review to appear ? I was asked sharply by Daniel . I explained that that depended on a number of things . I had an issue about ready to go , but my Review was printed in Holland , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presented a problem about gettingthe material up there , since the transportation and mail strikes . I need n't worry about that , I was informed by Daniel . He grinned at me . " We  --  that is , the students , not the Cinema Committee alone  --  have cars going to Holland all the time . We could deliver the material for you . And by boys without long hair . " His own hair was cut short , I noted . " We feel , " he looked around , " at least , I feel that the sooner the articles on us are on the stands in Paris and in America the better it is for us , and for the Revolution . Does anyone have any discussion on that ? " Instantly there was a babble of voices that made my head really ache . They certainly did have a thing about discussion . I had noticed from the moment I entered that this thing of democratic discussion was as much a sacred ritual with them as some other ritual might be with a church , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ass . Also , I found I was taking an active dislike to Daniel the Chairman for some reason I could not isolate or name . It was hot as hell in there , I was sweating , and the whole thing had been in French , which , though I speak it well enough , tires me when it is done in a climate of emotionalexcitement . And now Weintraub and that little girl Florence appeared to have disappeared somewhere . Just as if he had actively read my thoughts , Daniel smiled at me and said , " Let one of us show you around the rest of our establishment upp181here , why do n't you ? " He then plunged right back into the discussion , which by this time had turned from the delivery of my Review through to Holland to something having to do with various shooting assignments the various teams were competing for for tomorrow . The boy who took me around had long hair , and his long hair could have stood a good washing . He was called Raymond . The first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " cooking " area , which was in fact slightly larger than the " office " . It was nearly empty , the floor was dotted with rather ripe-looking blankets , and over a tiny butane cooking apparatus one boy was heating himself some canned soup . And over in one corner Weintraub was fucking that half-American girl Florence . The boy Raymond , he was quite short , did not turn one greasy hair . " Would you like to take a look down at the theater ? We have our own special balcony , " he told me quietly in French . " Why , yes , " I said . Neither Weintraub nor Florence looked up from their locked embrace , and as far as I could tell , without actually peering , did not even break their rhythm . So Raymond led me past the boy , still concentratedly heating his soup , down the narrow room to another door at the far end . When we opened it and stepped through , shutting it behind us , we were on a tiny darkened balcony right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floors below us the nonstop dialogue which had been going ever since the students occupied the Odeon four days ago was in full cry . A tall blond boy on the stage who was chairing the debate with a large gavel , and doing it well , had recognized a citizen , obviously not a student , and certainly no executive , in other words a worker , who was asking to large numbers of angry boos whether the developing general strikes might not be doing more harm to the French people than good . Amidst lots of derisive shouts the man stuck to his point and developedhis argument , which was essentially that what France really needed was more inflow of American capital investment , which according to him would automatically change the antiquated French capitalisticstructure and bring it along to the more modern American corporate system and in so doing would both quietly and peacefully do away with the old entrenched French Patronat which was the root of all the trouble anyway . He sat down red-faced to a smattering ofp182applause and a great number of derisive boos . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who rose to refute the first man . We went back in . I could hardly help seeing that Weintraub and Florence were still at it . " Would you like to take a look at the sleeping quarters ? " Raymond said politely . " Why , yes . I would , " I said . I hoped it sounded cool enough . We went back through the " office " , still vibrating with some democraticdiscussion or other , and through the other door . This room was narrower but considerably longer than the " cooking quarters " , darker , its floor covered with sleeping bags , greasy mattresses and the same sleazy-looking blankets , and on one of these Hill Gallagher was humping Samantha Everton . The blanket did n't cover much of them , and Samantha , who was not a tall girl at all , appeared to have very long and lovely legs  --  as pretty as Louisa 's in fact , which were the handsomest I 'd ever seen . " Very nice , " I said , and ducked back into the reverberating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baths ? " " Oh , we go to the public baths around the area , " Raymond smiled . " When we have the time to . " The kids were still discussing . I could not quite make out what the new discussion was about , but Weintraub had reappeared , sweating and red-faced . " She 's quite a little chick , old Florence , " he grinned when he came over . " Would you like to try her ? She likes you , she said . Likes you a lot . " " She said that ? " " Sure . I would n't kid you . " " I wonder if she washed ? " I said . " Washed ? " Weintraub said . " Washed ? Oh , washed . Well , I guess so . There 's a john right outside in the hall . She went there . " At that moment Florence , looking pleased and happy , came in from the outside door ; and suddenly something took hold of me and I thought why not ? After all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be , why not see what it was like ? I might be an " Older Generation " , but I still ought to know what the new world was going to be like . So when Florence came over to us , I took her hand.  |p183Actually  , she needed no urging . We went immediately into the " cooking quarters " , where the preoccupied boy was now eating the can of soup he had so laboriously and meticulously heated . We used the same blanket in the same corner she and Weintraub had used , and I was pleased to see that we did not upset the young man 's meal . I must say that she was not much of a lay . She certainly did not have any of Martine 's experience or finesse . She just sort of laid there . But , of course , as Weintraub said later , she was very young , she was only a kid.  | " You CA N'T EXPECT HER to have the ability of someone older who 's had years of practice and education in bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not , " I said . " But look at Sam . She 's the same age . Nineteen , too . " 1 was feeling bad now about the whole thing . " Ah , but Sam is a different kettle of fish ! " He grinned . " To coin an apt phrase . She 's sophisticated . She 's been around plenty . " " I suppose . " I felt gloomy . " But what about her and Hill , now ? I saw them in the  --  , you know . " I coughed . " I thought Florence was Hill 's  --  well , you know . " " But none of them believe in sleeping with just one person . Monogamistic love , " Weintraub said agitatedly . " You know that . Unless , of coarse , both parties decide that that is what they want . Then it 's their business . You know all that . So Sam 's making it with Hill a little bit now . And Florence is making it with me . And you . And a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sitting in a bar . In fact , it was the old Monaco Bar , that bum 's hangout , the same place where Dave had told me about first meeting the Cinema Group kids earlier in the month . We had left the OdCon around one-thirty , with the understanding I would do what I could about writing a Commentary for them when and if that werep186possible , and in the meantime would try to get two articles written for the Review , all of the material for which , the entire issue , the kids would guarantee to get out to my printers in Holland for me . They had offered me an assistant , and I had chosen the angelic-faced Terri of the beautiful hair when Hill , after his tete-a-tete with Samantha , had declined my request for him . Sam had not left with us . I must say , the old Monaco did not look like such a low dive anymore , after the happenings of the past few weeks . We had walked straight down to it from the front steps of the Odeon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that way was a huge cordon of police and police camions at the Carrefour , blocking off rue de l'Odeon where it met Boulevard St.-Germain . The CRS boys were lined up across the entire street , at least three lines deep , and wearing their helmets , gasmasks and fighting raincoats , and carrying shields and the long matraques . They hardly looked human . The smell of tear gas was everywhere , but we all were used to that by now . " Do n't worry about it . You and me can walk right through them to the Boulevard , " Weintraub said cheerily as he led me into his old Monaco stamping-ground . " Of course , if we were twenty years younger and had long hair we probably could n't , " he added . We had picked an empty table at the back . " I think Hill is falling for her , " I said now , after the exchange on sex . " For Sam . I mean in a really serious way . " " Oh , come on ! Of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then turned her over to me and that other kid . What 's his name ? Raymond . The one that took you around . " He was probably right . In any case I did n't think it was that important anyway . " Listen , Dave , " I said . " I 've just had an idea . A really brilliant idea . It was playing around sort of in the back of my mind all the time we were up there , and now suddenly it has crys-tallized . " " So what is it ? " " I 'm not the man to do their Commentary on their film for them . Oh , I could do one . And I 'll certainly go ahead and write those articles for them for the Review , though I doubt if they will help them as much as they are hoping . But as for doing a film Commentary , I 'm not really the man they want . I 've never done any film work . Harry Gallagher is the man they want ! "  |p187Weintraub  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grabbed up his Pernod and drained its milky contents suddenly and almost savagely . " Well , Jesus ! Why did n't I think of that ? " Then he paused another very long moment . " But it 's going to cause all sorts of hell 's orchards with Hill , you know . He was furious enough when I suggestedbringing you over . I told you , he voted against , remember ? What 'll happen if they ask his dad to come ? " " Are we doing all this for the Cinema Committee , or are we all doing it all for the sake of Hill Gallagher ? " I said . " That 's true , " Weintraub said thoughtfully . He signaled for anotherPernod . " But somehow it bothers me . I do n't know what could happen . " " Listen , " I said . " If it 's for the good of the Revolution '  --  and you know what I think this Revolution ' is going to come out to in the end  --  I do n't see how Hill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or is he for Hill Gallagher ? " " Well , " Weintraub said . " I am for the Revolution . We could go back up there and present them with the idea , certainly . " " Harry would be perfect for what they want , " I said . " And I 'm not chickening out or anything . " He drained off his new Pernod savagely , after adding a little water , and I suddenly had the distinct impression , quite clearly , that he was not at all that happy or that much at ease about having had to give up his beautiful Samantha to Hill , or to any of the others for that matter . " Okay , let 's go , " he said toughly , and pushed the little cash register tabs for our drinks over to me suggestively . I picked them up . " But will they be there still , now ? " " Are you kidding ? They 'll be there all night , most of them . " So that was what we did . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the foot of the street and walked straight back up to the massive front steps of the Odeon where our Laissez-Passer cards got us admitted immediately through the crowds . " You understand I hate to do this to Hill , " Weintraub said to me as we went up the marble stairs to the first floor , " but I do think it is good for the entirety of the Revolution . " I had not anywhere questionedhis motives . It turned out that Hill was not there when we arrived back up at tlhe tiny moisture-laden little room up under the eaves backstage.  |p188Neither  was Sam . They had gone somewhere . And after my presentationof the case for Harry 's nomination to do the Commentary , led on by Daniel the Chairman who harangued forcefully for Harry during the inevitable democratic discussion which followed , there was , with the absence of Hill and a few others , a unanimous vote in favor of asking Harry to do it . Anne-Marie voted for it , so did my now coassociateTerri , so did the bearded Bernard . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out that not one of the Cinema Committee knew or realized that Harry Gallagher , the famous avantgardeand radical screenwriter , was the father of their Comite member Hill Gallagher of the same last name . " I 'll talk to him about it tomorrow , " I said to Weintraub as we made our dim way back downstairs and left through the crowd . I called Harry the next morning . " What ? A Commentary ? A Commentary on the film they are going to make ? On the Revolution ? " There was a pause . " Hell , yes ! Christ , yes ! I 'd love to do it ! " Then another pause . " But I 'll have to see shot film . And I 'll have to have cutting permission . I 'll have to be able to work with whoever they have for cutters . " " I think they will give you all that , and more if you want . Look , I 'll take you over there tonight . Around midnight . That is , Weintraub and I will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really his idea from the be-ginning . " " Okay . But wait , " Harry said . " Wait . Wait a minute . I 'm not sure I can go tonight . I 've got a meeting . I guess you know what happened at Cannes yesterday ? " In fact , I did not . I had not yet seen the morning papers . Harry proceeded to tell me about it . Apparently on Sunday night the Cannes Film Festival , which had been going on for some days , had been closed down five days early by a group of agitators composed largely of the younger French directors and actors like Godard , Louis Malle , Francois Truffaut , Jean-Pierre Leaud and Carlos Saura . There was some confusion as to why , but mainly it was supposed to be a sympathy strike with the students and workers of France . Geraldine Chaplin , the pretty young star of the Spanish film Peppermint Frappe had rushed up onto the stage andp189attempted to close the curtains on the showing of her own film . M. Favre Le Bret @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demonstrations , to avoid the possibility of violence during film showings and " since circumstances did not permit projections under normal conditions . " So the whole thing was definitely finished , for the year . " So I 've got to get down there , " Harry said over the phone . I did n't understand . " But why ? If it 's all over and finished , what 's the point ? Why do you have to go ? " " I 'm going down to strike my own film , " Harry said . " It 's the only film still shooting in France , for Christ 's sake . " I could hear the clarion call of the old warrior in his voice . " You 're what ? " I roared . " You 're out of your mind . It 's an Americanfilm , not a French one . " " Does n't matter , " Harry said . " They 're using French crews . I 'm going to strike it . " It was a **32;12871;TOOLONG which was being shot in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Harry had not only written it , but had worked on it all along with Steinerwein . " You really must be out of your mind , " I said into the phone . " No , " Harry said . " We had a meeting of the Directors and Actors Union , yesterday night , after the news came in , late , and voted to strike that film , too . I was selected to go down because I know personallyjust about every grip and cameraman-technician working on it . " " But what about poor Allen Steinerwein ? " " Tough luck . But he 'll have to take his chances like everybody else . So we 're having a strategy meeting this afternoon , to decide on the best approach . That 's why I 'm afraid I might not be able to make it to the Odeon with you tonight . " " Well , I suppose it will wait till you get back , " I said . " But these kids are getting nervous and if anybody ever needed help , I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I do n't really know . It depends on how much trouble I have when I get there . Five days . Maybe a week . " " Well then I think you really ought to try to make it to Odeon tonight . Before you leave . " " Actually I probably wo n't leave until Wednesday , " Harry said.  | " Look . I 'll call you tonight . After dinner . Sometime around ten-thirty . I 'll know more about what the situation is like by then . Okay ? " " All right . But I think you really are off your rocker . " There was a pause , as if he not only did not care about my comment , but actually had not heard it , something else totally occupying his mind . Then he said , " What is Hill going to think , or say , about all this ? " he asked suddenly . " He 's on that Committee , ai nt he ? " " I 'm sure he 'll be against it , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me over there . But he 's already been outvotedby a massive majority . " Harry did n't answer for a moment . " Well , if he was outvoted that much , I think it 's my duty to go anyway . Do n't you ? " " I suppose I did , " I said . " It was my idea in the first place .  --  But I do think you 've gone off your nut to go to Cannes . Let somebody else go . " " Go fuck yourself , " he said . " Good-bye , " I answered . " Do n't forget to call tonight . " But the phone had already gone dead somewhere in the middle . I dined alone that night . I went across the bridge , past the two little camions of cops who were there now 24 hours a day , to Chez Rene on the corner of Cardinal Lemoine and Boulevard St.-Germain , a favorite place of mine for years where I was well known by all the waiters and the boss himself , who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bellyful of students , film Documentaries and Commentaries , and film people in general . Who in hell gave a real damn about the Cannes Film Festival anyway ? Whether they struck them God damned selves or not ? It was some kind of macabre joke . And I was sick of Harry , driving all that way down to Cannes , to strike his own film . He must really be out of his head . I was back home by ten-thirty , passing the ominous , yet gentle and preoccupied little blue camions . Several of the cops inside , who knew my face by now , waved and grinned at me . The phone rang soon after I was back in the apartment . " I 'm ready to go , " Harry said . " Can you get Weintraub ? " " We 're to pick him up at the Monaco Bar , " I said . " I 'll meet you at the footbridge , okay ? " I do not think I ever saw anyone take over a roomful of people thep191way Harry took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the eaves of the Odeon and its gang of democratic-discussion  --  oriented students . Not one of them talked back , or offered to argue , or mentioneddiscussion . This included Hill . And anyway , Harry went right to the prime point . " You say you want to make a film about the Revolution . But what kind of film is it you want to make ? Something to be shown at Rotary Clubs and Ladies ' Clubs luncheons across America ? Just what have you got shot ? Have you listed it down , for each can , like you should have done ? No . Of course not . Nobody thought of that . So what you 've got here is this . And nobody really knows what it is , really . " He looked at the refrigerator box . " Is this all the shot film you 've acquired during the past month ? " " No , " said Chairman Daniel , who was looking less and less like a steel-rimmed Commissar . " We have at least that much more stored in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " said Harry . " All right . That 's not so bad . Except for one thing  --  repetition . I 'll bet you got about two miles of film , most of it over- or under-exposed , showing groups of students marching toward a stationary camera ; and about two miles of film , over- or underexposed , of masked cops charging a stationary camera , which is probablyhand-held and wavery anyway . And what kind of a film are you going to make out of that ? They probably wo n't even want to show it in the high schools in the States , let alone the colleges . " So . Questions : " Have you even got remotely in mind any sort of a continuity , a story ? If you have , you 've got to have characters . Have you got characters , to whom things happen , and whom the audience can follow the development of through-out ? " No . Of course , you have n't . You never thought of that , did you ? " Harry looked sardonically , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said , indicating Terri of the beautiful hair . " He 'd make the perfect boy for your film . " He looked again . " And take her . " He indicated Anne-Marie . " You give me those two , plus three camera crews , with or without hand-held cameras , and I can make you a film that will be begged for in every theater in America . And I can do it all in ten days . I think the Revolution is going to last that long . And I'mp192sure there 's some footage in what you 've already shot that we can use for fill-in , timewise . " Now . Do you want to do that ? Or something like that ? If so , I 'm your man . And gladly . And all for free . I do n't want a dime of the take . But I 'll get your story seen , and loved , in every moviehouse in Europe and America . " He paused , and grinned . " Except perhaps in France . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of professional advice , Mister Gallagher , " Chairman Daniel said , in an exceedingly unbrassy voice , for him . " I think we ought to discuss it , though , first . Since that is the method we hold to in a democratic Revolution of this sort . " " Well , you discuss it , gentlemen , " Harry said . " I 'm prepared to sit and wait half an hour . But I will not discuss . And if I take it on for you , there will be no more discussion once you designate me as the Man ' . From that time on I 'll have to be the absolute boss . Please understand that . " " I 'm not sure we can decide in half an hour , " Daniel said placatingly . " Well , that 's okay , " Harry grinned . " I 've got to go to Cannes to do a little job tomorrow or next day . You can have until I return , which may be anywhere from five days to a week . There 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I expect . Especially with all this footage that you 've got shot already , to splice in when we need it . I 'll need to get to know your cutters , of course . Need to get to know them intimately . Because once the shooting is all done we 'll be working together very closely . " " We have n't even decided on cutters yet , " Daniel said . " Well , like I said , you 've got roughly five days or a week . " And he stood up from the chair where he had been sitting uncomfortably in front of the " office " table-desk . Young Hill had been standing far at the back , in a darkened corner , all of this time while Harry was making his big-time lecture . I guess I had sidled slowly over toward him unconsciously . He and Harry had said a brief " Hello " and passed a perfunctory handshake when we first came in . But after that , Hill had offered not a word . Somewhere in the middle of Harry 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took too tough a line with these unprofessionalp193kids and was also a bit egocentrically long-winded , Samantha Everton had slipped in through the outside door and quietly slipped over to us . " I do n't think you understand one thing , Mister Gallagher , " Daniel the Chairman said now , looking up at the standing Harry . " We do n't want to make a love-story movie , or something on that order . We want only to show the truth to the world of what has happened , is happening and will happen in this Revolution of ours . " " I am totally in accord with that , " Harry said sharply . " But I must add one point . Do not forget that the audiences of the world do n't give a damn about the truth , unless it is presented to them in a way in which they can personally associate . They do not , for example , give one good goddamn about seeing seas of anonymous student faces , or even thousands of fighting , attacking cops ' faces  --  especially if they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the agony of a few students , whom they can pick out , recognize , and as I said , associate with over and over through the film . That seems to me to be , gentlemen , your basic problem here . " Anyway , you gentlemen discuss it . I 've got to go . And as soon as I 'm back from setting up this strike in Cannes , 1 ' 11 be in touch . ( a va ? Okay ? " They had been speaking in French all the way , but he added the word " okay " in English , at the end . " Okay , " Daniel grinned back . Harry had made quite an impression , I must say that . And I noted that he had held back his purpose of striking the film in Cannes until the very last , like a good professional . Now he turned away and , grinning , came over to where Hill and I stood in our darkened corner . He was a tall man , and he had his arms out , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Let 's us go and have a drink , what do you say ? " he said . He pretended not to see Samantha . I have always been sure , by the look that passed swiftly across his face and was as swiftly swallowed , hidden , put away , that he at that moment knew what had happened and was in process of happening with Hill and Sam . " You can come with us , too , if you want , " he said to her. " 1 thought you were magnificent , " Sam said in a near whisper . " AlthoughI only heard the last half of it . "  |p194Harry  continued with his gesture , and put one friendly arm around me and the other around Hill . He somehow carefully excluded Sam from this embrace . " You can come too , if you want , Dave , " he called across several heads to where Weintraub sat on a wood bench with Florence . " No thanks , " Weintraub said with a fine grin . " I guess I 'll stay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be your spy . " Everybody laughed , and a fine feeling was in the room as the four of us went out the door . I do n't remember what bar it was we went to . It was not the old Monaco . We took to the rue Racine again , as Harry and I had done once before , which was not blocked off by any cordon of CRS . We came out onto the Boulevard St.-Michel which was still jammed with people craning to watch the fighting still going on down at the Carrefour with St.-Germain . We walked south , uphill , away from the river , and it was one of those bars along there that Harry stopped at , and went in , and sat down inside . Almost at once I felt like , as my old grandfather might have said , the proverbial one-armed paper-hanger with an itch . Whatever it was was happening , or was going to happen , they none of them wanted me around . So I left them there , and walked home up the rue Soufflot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all in a line , and then down Cardinal Lemoine . It was almost the same way we had come.  |p195I  MUST SAY I REALLY did not think anything had happened . I mean what , after all , could have happened ? And Harry called the next day to tell me he was leaving for Cannes that evening , the Tuesday , instead of on the Wednesday . Then late on the Wednesday afternoon Hill called me . I had spent most of the Wednesday at his parents ' place watching TV . They were showing the second ( and last ) day of the debate in the Assemblee Nationale on the motion of censure against Premier Pompidou'sGovernment and M. Pompidou was speaking himself . It was the first time the Government had allowed such a broadcast since the troubles started . But after Pompidou 's own speech , a tough and fairly reasonable effort I thought , I got bored with the rest of it and went home hoping to work . Anyway , Pompidou 's Government survived the attempt to topple it , though only by i i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Hill called . I do not know where he called from . In any case , what he wanted to tell me was that Samantha had suddenly disappeared . Hill was in great personal distress . Naturally , I asked him to come right over to my pad , as we " Older Generations " all call our apartments nowadays . " Do n't say anything to Mother or Dad , " he asked . " Your dad 's already gone . " **25;12905;TOOLONG Span Rating , and his Qualitative Concentration Ratio is in the highest five-percentile group . He also scored very well in Extra-Sensory Perception . " " Oh my God . " " Well , " Mr. Peake leaned back and tossed his napkin on the table , " all of that must make for a fundamentally very interestingperson , say what you will . " " I 'll tell you , Mr.  --  ah  --  Peake . I do n't really want my mind read by anybody . I do n't want a tutor in residence either . I want somebody who plays a really good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and invites really attractive girls for weekends . I also would like somebody who had some kind of decent income and I 'm not being a snob and talking about his family background or what school he went to or any of that crap , I could n't care less about any of that . I 'm talking about somebody who can pay half the check when we take two really attractive girls out in New York . I 've got a few friends like that around here and one was set to be my roommate , but he had some bad luck . So I wish you would fix this for me . If that 's not asking too much . " " Oh , no , no , I 'm sure it is n't . What I started to explain on the phone this morning was the way to do it , and I 'm sure it can be done . Just bring it up at the master 's office in your college and I 'm sure it can be arranged . And of course , out of courtesy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " After lunch Gordon strolled down the street to the Yale Daily News building , where there was to be an extremely important meeting . He was vice-chairman of the News . He and the other editors assembled on the third floor of the building , where there was a board room which , because of the sober executive elegance of its paneling and its other appointments , could have made the directors of the United States Steel Corporation feel at home . At Yale , Gordon reflected with crusty satisfaction , when they did something they did it right . The chairman called the meeting to order and came straight to the point . " All right , " he said without preliminaries , " Who shall we ask ? " " Whom shall we ask , " said a voice from the end of the table.  |p13Then  they all settled down to think , and to wonder if they dared offer the names they had already thought of . Finally from the depths of a chair in the middle of the table came these words : " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came the answer . " Pius ? A bit overexposed , maybe ? He 's in that window in St. Peter 's every Sunday , you know . " " What about General de Gaulle ? " " Finished . " A concurring silence followed . " I know . Let 's get traditional . How about the Duke of Edinburgh ? " Several irritated faces greeted this , from the leftist sports editor , the Irish managing editor , and the anarchist editorial secretary . " All right , all right , forget it , " muttered the student . Contemplation filled the still room . Then from the bottom of the table the editorial secretary , grinning his secret , fiendishgrin , said quietly , " We need somebody practical , somebody who 's really contributing to America , to world peace . Let 's ask Wernher von Braun . " " Who ? " whispered someone uncertainly . " The German guy who makes rockets . " " Very funny . " " Why not ? He 's the wave of the future . He 's everything the Duke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the editorial secretary , and so nobody spoke . Then the chairman , who was very much liked by everyone , said in his pleasant way , " Could n't we invite Mrs. Roosevelt ? To talk about the UN , for instance . " Respectful consideration followed . Then Gordon Durant said , " Yeah , but do you think a woman , even Eleanor Roosevelt  --  " he felt justified in using her first name , since he knew her , " is what we need ? And she has n't been the head of the United Nations . She has n't even been the head of the American Delegation . If we 're going that way , and personally I think the UN is out of it , completely out of it , then we ought to give-what's-his-name , the new head of the UN , Dag Hammarskjolda chance . "  |p14Everybody  silently agreed that Dag Hammarskjold ought to be given a chance before Eleanor Roosevelt . The managing editor was frowning and drumming his fingers on the polished table top . " I think we 're getting pretty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , significance for today . " He took a long , significant pause and then said quietly , " Mao Tse-tung . " " Mao Tse-tung ! " " How would we get through to him ? " " What languages does he speak ? " " How do we get him out of China ? " " What would the University say ? " " I guess the Secret Service would give him protection . " " Mao Tse-tung ! " The managing editor , finally tacitly conceding that Mao Tse-tung was too much even for them to cope with , sighed and was silent . " What about General MacArthur ? " " Two years out of date , a nobody . " " And that Old soldiers fade away ' speech . A cornball . " " Why do n't we get off political people this year , " suggested someone at the bottom of the table . " Why not get , I do n't know , a scientist ? " " Well , who ? " " I do n't know , Dr. Spock  --  " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unison . " That was a joke , son , " choked the other , " I mean , there'swell  --  whatabout , let 's be original , Rita Hayworth and Aly Khan ? " The room was so stunned by this proposal that at first no one knew how to react . Any attitude toward such a revolutionarysuggestion might be the wrong one . They all sensed that Gordon Durant would have to decide what attitude was correct , and decide that instant . He leaned back in his chair , elbows on the arms , and said quietly , " Too middle class . " That eliminated that . The editor who had suggested it sighed almost audibly with relief.  | " Let 's settle this , " Gordon went on . " Time 's awastin . ' Let 's ask John Foster Dulles and be done with it . " He settled back in his chair again . " A secretary of state has enough prestige for us . " The others looked muddled and at cross-purposes : the famousDurant tactlessness , or candor . Still , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ News formally voted that the honor of speaking at their annual banquet in the spring would be conferred upon the Secretary of State of the United States of America . Gordon realized that there might have been some even more ego-gratifying guest speaker for the editorial board to select , but he simply could n't sit around waiting for the name to be mentioned . He knew they would always accept anyone as much of a world figure as a secretary of state , and he also knew , based on past experience , that most world figures would accept , a knowledge which in the furthest corner of his mind inspired in him a small , secret contempt for world figures . Whiskey ! Never , never again . Leaving the News building , Gordon walked straight to the Payne Whitney Gymnasium and straight to the steam room there . Once installed , prone as a corpse on a slab , with the clouds of steam thickening rapidly around him , heat seeping into every joint , every pore , every aperture , he relaxed , relaxed , relaxed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two thoughts : the Secretary of State would do ; and Lou Colfax , Interest Concentration Ratio , Extra-Sensory Perceptionand all , would n't do . The Sterling Memorial Library at Yale was only slightly less impregnable to assault than the Payne Whitney Gymnasium . Nothing in its construction suggested that it was to be used for the storing or reading of books . Like all Yale buildings , it was a fortress , but in this case , elaborately disguised as a cathedral . This triple confusion made the behavior of people within its confines very singular . Awed and stealthy , they crept along the great nave toward the high desk , instinctivelyp16unsure whether they could actually obtain a book from this tabernacle , fazed by all the Gothic stone and leaded windows , bemused by an inner cloister which lacked only nuns , feeling reverential without reason . To it , during his freshman year , Lou Colfax had been in the habit of withdrawing , to meditate in a little side chapel , wonder , speculate . Eventually he had won the right , rare for an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into it he had often retreated . After his sleepless night in Gordon Durant'ssitting room he fled straight to the library , like a medievalfugitive seeking sanctuary . They gave him the same cubiclehe had had two years before , and with mystical relief he stepped into the elevator , which rose through the immense pile of books , and got off on the catwalk on the layer where his alcove was situated . Clement Jonaz still had the next cubicle and was in it , studying . " Now , Louis , " he began after Lou had sat down in Jonaz 's cubicle , " I want to talk to you very seriously about your undergraduate career . What class are you now ? " " A sophomore . " " Well , I want to talk to you very seriously about your impact here . You have got to start now to make an impact . As long as America is what it is , Yale is going to be what it is . Yale is a mirror in a fun house . Take a good look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way you let your hair grow rather longer than Yale likes . Why ? You 're not going to prove anything here . You 've got to understand that Yale is Wall Street and the State Department and all that , Yale is , well , Yale is American success , much more so than Harvard , Harvardis too idiosyncratic , and much more so than Princeton , Princeton is too casual , too Southern-oriented . " He lit a cigarette . " I 'm what they call a leftist , I suppose good old Senator McCarthy would say I was a subversive . Do I go around in black with long hair here ? Of course , " he grinned broadly , " I do n't think my hair will grow very long , kinky , oh my , yes , kinky , but if it would I would n't let it . N0000 . If you ca n't beat ' em , join ' em . I 'm their parlor leftist , their cocktail/party Negro , and they love it . Be part of it , I say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't get anywhere around here . Maybe later , I think so , probably later , I hope so , I do n't know , maybe . But I say , keep your own ideas but join ' em , bore from within  --  " " You are a bit of a  --  " " Shut up . Bore from within . You wo n't even know what 's going on here unless you get on the social ladder . In a way , you wo n't even go to Yale unless you do . Yale wo n't happen to you . So ! " he leaned back in his chair , " you 've got to make an impact . " " I do ? What shall I do ? Jump out the window ? Oh , that 's right , we 're in the library . There are n't any . " " Start thinking very seriously about your impact . But to do that you naturally have to know what this University , what all universities are for , on the undergraduate level , I mean . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for ? " " To educate the students , of course . " Clement gazed shrewdly at him . " You 're too intelligent to really believe that . " " Am I ? What should I believe ? " " Education and classes and assignments and examinations and , " waving , " all these books piled by the millions all around us here , that 's just a facade , a fake . That 's just an excuse , just a way of organizing a few thousand aimless young men . It 's like drill in the Army . You know about drill ? " Lou looked at him . " I just got out of the Marine Corps . " " Yes , of course , then you do know about drill , do n't you ? . You realize that all those thousands of hours you spent learningto drill and then drilling were totally useless , not the slightest practical use . " Lou nodded drily . " It 's just a technique for turning men into automatons , you know that , train them to obey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face , about face , all meaningless , ridiculous , of course . Studying is the drill of the university . It does n't mean anything , nobody ever learns anything , but it 's a useful way ofp18organizing all you rabble . The university only has one real job . You know that . " " Yes ? Well , what is it ? " " To keep you . " " Hum ? " " To keep you . They keep young men from age eighteen to age twenty-two . That 's all they really do . That 's all anybody wants them to do . Keep you off the streets , keep you out of the way , keep you out of your parents ' hair . They keep you . It 's like a kennel . " " Gosh , " said Lou sardonically . " Oh , go to hell . The trouble with you is , if something is n't perfect you wo n't accept it at all . That 's why you look in the mirror so much . Because you think you 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he responded jokingly . But it was , in fact , no joke : Lou Colfax had a Colfax face , and in all the sorry procession of disasters and failures his relations had trailed behind them through the years and the generations , their faces as a rule had been strikingly handsome or memorably beautiful . Wasted , Lou thought himself , wasted beauty , gems of purest rays serene buried in the darkest , unfathomed sea , lost . " Anyway , I 'm nearly twenty-one years old so I 'll only have the Colfax looks for a few more years and then that 'll be gone . You ought to see my father . U-r-r-r-a-a-g-h ! " " Yes , " said Clement quietly , " you 'll want to destroy that family advantage . " " What ? " " Nothing . " After a pause , Lou said simply , " I know what you mean . " He tried to be , at whatever cost to himself , unswervingly honest . If it was based on pride , as it was , well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad one . But , of course , all of these qualities  --  pride , honesty , destructiveness , to name only three of the massive clashing passions he struggled with  --  made living with him , and his living with himself , tempestuouson the surface , and tempestuous in the depths . " You may be just enough of a freak , " Clement went on ,  |p19eyeing  him shrewdly , " to make one of the societies . I want to explain the procedure to you , how you conduct yourself on the great day , next year , when they come for you . " Lou shivered imperceptibly , at the phrase " come for you . " It touched one of his fears : the police , the Gestapo , the little men with the nets , nameless thugs , these were some of the long-shadowed figures who might " come for him " ; he had imagined them as a child ; he still sometimes imagined them . " What happens , " Clement went on , unaware ; Lou was relieved to see that Clement after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you will be sitting in your room in the college at nine o'clock one Thursday evening in the spring of your junior year . You will be alone . Shoot your roommate , if necessary , to insure this . " " All right , " murmured Lou , brightening . " Several people , dressed in severest New York black , will wait outside your door . As the bell tower sounds the last of its nine rather depressing tolls , one of these apparitions will knock . Come in , ' you call in a tone receptive , interested , but at the same time by no means effusive , overeager , or too ingratiating . The apparition , all in black , rigid with the importance and absurdity of his mission , comes in , and you halfrise . You are , of course , at your desk , sketching . " Lou had been idly drawing on one of the strips of paper , sketching a firm-lined , stylized saint with halo , her palms joined , robed , barefoot , standing on a snake . It had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You are then at your desk sketching , and you halfrise . But this emissary is not from the society you want . You sink back into your chair . I am from Foot and Mouth , ' he declares in his crypt voice , do you accept ? " No , ' you answer regretfully , no , I decline . ' And you wait them out . You just might be freak enough to be elected  --  to  --  to any of them . " " I 'm not interested , " Lou said in a level tone . After a pause Clement observed , " No , I do n't think you are . " In front of Lou and behind him and all around him the great core of books , four million or more of them , reacheditp20upward , a vast rectangular load of learning and imitations of learning , piled up there over the centuries like the tower in the Bible which was supposed to reach to heaven and so free men from their earthbound limitations . But instead in the end it became fragmented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way of climbing up their spines to heaven . Lou had tried that . " Are you still interested in plankton ? " inquired Clement , who was genuinely interested in Lou 's interests , and so unique among his acquaintances at Yale . " Yes , but I have n't found anything conclusive yet . Same thing with algae . You see , " and with his rather large and nervous hands he took a fresh piece of paper and began rapidly sketching a cross-section of the North Atlantic Ocean off Cape Cod , its currents , migration patterns , its potential for producing food . Lou was quite sure the human race would starve to death unless the oceans could be used to grow food . Clement watched and listened . " And your desalinization project ? " " Redesigned some of the features and , you know , it 's perfectlypractical and some version could go into operation very soon . " And then he reverted to the discussion of sowing the oceans with food . Clement followed with his habitual prayerfulattention . He was very intelligent and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could follow Louis Colfax through all the corridors and convolutions of his mind . Suddenly from Lou 's wrist a tiny , busy buzzing erupted importantly . It was the sole feature about him which Clement really disliked . He did n't fundamentally mind the thousand irritations and even abuses Lou in his strangeness had inflictedon him , because he felt they were a necessary roughage in the growth of this peculiar but valuable plant , Lou Colfax . He did n't truly mind the time Lou drugged him . He did n't fundamentally object even to the black eye . All of that , and much , much more , was part of the roughage . But he did really object to that damned alarm wrist watch . Looking mournfully down on it , he said , " Is it time for you to drop dead or what ? " Lou snickered once . " Time for lacrosse . " " Are you still going to spend hours of your time trying top21catch a ball in a net ? " inquired Clement . " Why ? " " Because the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cocked in his bird look . " Oh , " said Clement with sour , false comprehension . " Oh . Of course . That explains everything . " Looking pleased , Lou gathered up his algae sketches , put them in his own cubicle , and then moved rapidly away along the metal catwalk which enclosed and bisected the tower of books . He could not pass a shelf of books without scanning their titles , and now , as usual , one caught his eye and his mesmerized curiosity . Its title was The Totalitarian Vision . After a moment 's sharp inner struggle he found he could not continue on his way without it , so he pulled the book from the shelf and buried his concentration in it . Fascinating . Still , there was lacrosse , the next lower layer of his mind reminded him . Deeper still , the controls of his legs took command , and he moved deliberately , reading , to the end of the walk , turned accurately into the steep , narrow metal stairway without liftinghis eyes from the page @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of books , reading . At the bottom he went through a doorway and entered the vaulting library nave once again , slipped the book inside his shirt and , smiling mistily at the book-checking lady near the main door , continued out through it . He would have liked to check out the book , in a sense . And in another sense he did not want to check it out at all , did not want to make that concession to regulation , restriction , order . He was destructive . Right . Coming up to his battered Morgan sportscar on the side street , he put The Totalitarian Vision , opened to the page he had reached , on the other seat , and roared off to lacrosse . The Yale Bowl , being two miles from the rest of the campus on the outskirts of New Haven , had been made particularly invulnerable to attack . From the outside it simply resembled a very formidable earthenwork redoubt , not unlike the Maginot line , which could hold out against most onslaughts indefinitely . Spreading away from it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lacrosse and soccer and other such minor sports , forp22of course only varsity football was gladiatorial enough for the great inner oval , the great Roman hemistheater of the Bowl . Lou trailed out of the field house in his lacrosse shorts and shirt and shoes , slipping the helmet over his head with the metal faceguard curling out in front of his nose and attached to a bar strapped across his chin . He carried the lacrosse stick awkwardly in his left hand . Ugh , he thought to himself , ugh . Still there were the faintly undulating reaches of the fields , evocative of some sort of glory , something magical which he could never conceivably have identified  --  he had made a creditablestart at creating a perpetual motion machine but to explain even a small part of what such a stretch of open sports field meant to him was totally beyond his powers . It was one of those sparkling Connecticut September afternoons , what 's more , which meant that Lou would be secretly out of his mind with the intoxicating promise of it until well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of course , of grass out here , slightly moist grass , mown grass , and that smell , especially after the Marine Corps dustbowls where he had largely spent the last year , was almost enough to undo him . " Nice day , " he remarked to the coach . " Yeah , " answered the coach with reflex enthusiasm , before noticing who had spoken . " Oh . You 're back again . Let 's see . You 're  --  " " Colfax . " " Oh yeah . Well . Are you better at lacrosse ? " " No , " he answered simply . The coach squinted at him . Then why are you out here , his face demanded . Lou stared blankly back . I only wish I knew , his mind wanted to answer , but no trace of this showed . Most of what he felt his face never showed . The game began . Lou was playing one of the three midfield positions , although he knew that midfield was the hardest position in this impossible game . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went to Lou 's team . The midfield moved down toward the other goal , passing the ball back and forth , Lou realizing with a kind of fatalistic , surprised pleas/ure that he could after all sometimes catch the thing . The other side 's defenseman was jabbing him with his stick , then Lou saw one of his own team planted firmly to his left , and moving swiftly just behind that player he " brushed off " the defenseman and suddenly there was the goal open in front of him  --  he had never scored at lacrosse in his life  --  and the goalie inadequately trying to block the whole cage with his body and stick ; Lou cocked his stick , certain to score , and then the brushed-off defenseman was next to him holding his own stick like a baseball bat and he swung it at Lou , ricochetedoff Lou 's shoulder and hit the face guard , driving it back into his teeth . At the same time Lou fired the ball and scored . The defenseman , who looked like a long , undernourishedwolf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cavity in the middle of his teeth . This was it . The single hereditaryadvantage he had had , the one thing to make up for the myriad curses in his blood , his Colfax looks , had just been ruined . His two front teeth had just been knocked to pieces by that maniac . Stalking across the field through the other indecisivelymilling players , gripping his own stick , now , as if it too were a baseball bat , Lou closed in on the Wolf , still loping along the sidelines . " You 've just broken my front teeth , " he pronounced in a tone which made the Wolf glance swiftly at him , then look at the way Lou was holding his stick . " That 's right , " Lou continued in the same disturbing tone of voice , " I 'm holding it like a baseball bat , the way you held it when you busted my teeth . " " I did not ! " cried the Wolf , his voice rising toward falsetto . " You 're crazy . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and hearing this sound coming from the newly jagged edges of his teeth he started for the Wolf , but by now the coach and other players were surrounding them , and they were pulled apart , explained to , argued with , placated . An hour later , back in his  --  yes , damn it , his !  --  rooms in Pierson . College , mercifully empty of Gordon Durant , Lou went into the bathroom and closed and locked the door . Tensely he went up to the mirror and very slowly bared hisp24teeth . There they were , just as regular and white and even as ever , except for the two upper front ones which were very slightly chipped . It was not , after all , a disaster . It was not , after all , the end of the world . It was not even the end of his good appearance . He would probably still be able to find a mate , to reproduce after all . His tongue had made the gap feel infinitely larger than it was . And there were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teeth and make them look exactly as they had been before . He shut his mouth , he sighed . Doomsday had been deferred . And after all , why did he play a game as notoriously rough as lacrosse unless , as Clement had indicated , he really wanted to be involved in damage , injury , destruction ? It was n't as though he enjoyed it ever ! And certainly he was never going to get any recognition out of it . He liked exercise , but why this exercise ? He loved the playing field , the great , clipped sweep of green , but other , easier sports were played there . Why did he insist on playing a game where everyone raced around , brandished clubs menacingly at each other ? ( " Because the Indians did it ! " ) Yes . The savages . An hour later , Durant came in and went into the bedroom which by rights should be Lou 's . " Get out of my room , " said Lou in a metallic tone . Gordon gazed opaquely over his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " What did you say ? " " I said get the hell out of my bedroom . " Lou was very pale , his large fingers moved faintly , he was balancing on the balls of his feet . Gordon tried to continue gazing with calm incredulity at him , but in this long , black-clad figure just perceptibly vibratingwith aggressive energy facing him he saw a force he had never suspected in Lou Colfax , deeper than mere will power , a fundamental vitality . And Colfax was , after all , only assertinghis rights . " Oh , " said Gordon , beginning to gather up his books and papers , " I thought you were using your cubicle in the library to study in  --  "  | " And did you think I was going to sleep in the living room for the rest of the semester ? " Gordon shrugged faintly . " Those sporting prints in the living room are ugly , " continuedLou , " get them out . " Gordon , moving like an automaton , took his materials and stalked out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned and firmly shut the door . That evening after dinner Lou came back to the rooms to find that one of the four sporting prints had been removed from the living room wall . Then , overcome by one of the abrupt fatigues which could fall on him without warning , he turned off the light and got into bed . The window next to the bed opened on one of the moats , only three or four feet wide , but nine or ten feet deep here , with a high picked fence on the far side of it , and beyond that , the back of a fraternity house . Some time after he had gotten into bed , Lou was roused out of a doze by a low moaning sound . This continued to float up out of the darkness intermittently for several minutes and then the moaning began to form itself into a word . " Ou-ouou ! " it seemed to be , and then more clearly , " Lou-lou  --  Loulou-lou , " and after a while , " Colfaaaxxx " wafted hollowly on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he clearly heard floating up from somewhere below through the September night and into his darkened bedroom . Suddenly the bedroom door was flung open and a ball of flame was thrown into the room and landed on the floor next to his bed . Lou Colfax stared at it for several seconds , then with a very controlled manner he got out of bed and , wedging a notebook and a ruler under the ball , which was paper with something inflammable poured on it , he threw it out the window into the moat . Silence followed ; or was there an undercurrent of whisperingsomewhere around him in the night ? He leaned his arms on the windowsill and looked out and down , and although he could see nothing human he said into the darkness , " What children ! Silly brats ! Go to hell ! and , strangely enough , thatp26seemed to stop them . A suppressed snicker or two , a scraping , he thought he heard those , then nothing more . Nothing more except his own blood reverberating in his ears . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miasma world of a nightmare , not one of his usual class B variety but a really huge , vicious nightmare , and awoke from it sitting on the windowsill with his feet dangling toward the moat . Or was he still asleep then , and was that all part of the nightmare ? And had the cries and moans been dreamt also , the hooting of his name , the fireball ? The next morning he pulled on a pair of khaki pants hacked off above the knee and lowered himself into the moat in the classic manner , by tying bedsheets together , and securing them to the radiator . He lowered himself hand-under-hand down the red brick face of the outside wall and was nearing the grass at the bottom of the moat when Richard Anders leaned out of the window above his own and said , " And good morning to you ! " " Good morning ! " cried Lou , letting go of the sheet in his surprise and landing in the grass in his bare feet . " I  --  hadroppedmy  --  toothbrush out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He despised to lie . It rubbed so abrasively against that pillar of pride at the center of him . Still , this time , this desperate time , in shorts at the bottom of a moat , he would have to allow himself to do it . Richard Anders smiled down at him . " Do you want to borrow mine ? " he finally inquired . " I 'll find it . " There did seem to be bits of charred paper on the grass , or were they bits of burned leaves which had drifted there , or soot from a chimney ? " You sure were noisy last night , " said the voice from the second story . He stopped and looked up . " I was ? " " That yelling out the window  --  " " Oh , was I  --  yeah , um , few drinks too many , I guess . " His rigid commandment against lying was by now in shreds . " I forget exactly what I was yelling . " " So do I , " said Richard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . " Sure you do n't want to take a turn on my toothbrush ? " " Oh no . I 'm fine . Go on  --  go on about your business . " About your business ! Lou Colfax went rigid as stone at hearing himself say that , all his muscles locking in a supreme attempt to block the slightest visible sign of his bottomless embarrassment . He could not believe that this antediluvian , old-lady 's phrase had escaped from him . It was Aunt Fanny 's favorite , and it had been lurking at the bottom of his mind , waiting for the most inappropriate moment  --  barefoot at dawn at the bottom of a moat !  --  to spring out and inflict , once again , the curse of the Colfaxes . Richard Anders , however , had withdrawn from the window and perhaps not even heard the words , or at least he pretended not to have . Lou did not know Richard Anders very well , but he was still rather certain that he was good-natured , one of the old-fashioned natures . Unless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moaning-and-fireball plot . If there had been a moaning-and-fireball plot . The scraps and bits at the bottom of the moat were inconclusive , so he decided to climb back to his room . He looked up for the sheet and saw that it was well out of reach and then realized that he was trapped . " Richard , " he called out , and waited . Nothing . " Richard ! Ah  --  Richard Anders . " Silence , except for the echo his cry was raising up and down the walls of the college and the walls of the fraternity houses on the other side of the moat . " Richard ! " he yelled again , very loudly . Still only echoes followed . Then a face appeared at another window , and then several more new faces , and then chuckles and remarks and more faces and mounting amusement and exchanges of observations which truly rose to hilarity when somebody noticed that sheet , hanging down toward him but not hanging down far enough , and then Gordon Durant 's face appeared at his window registeringfirst amazement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ campus policemen came with a ladder , and as he was climbing up it he received an ovation of derision , and then he was in his bedroom , the perfect fool.  |p28Lou  had had almost no sleep for two nights . The feeling of light-headedness this caused was familiar , and so was the gathering sense of unreality , as though he himself were made of paste and the world around him of cellophane . It was all familiar from his first infernal days in the Marine Corps , when there had never been a chance to sleep either , and where he had , of course , been the official butt of the company , forced to wear a bucket over his head for hours every day , called always and by everyone simply " Shit , " the drill instructor 's name for him . He realized at once that the aim in Marine Corps Boot Camp was to break down his previous personality and put in its place a human machine conditioned for combat . On his last days in the Marine Corps he realized that half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pieces all around him . But neither they nor he had succeeded in putting it together again as a machine for combat , or anything else . The voices in the night , the fireball , the moat fiasco , all brought the insomniac humiliations of his first Marine days surging dismally back.  |p29Not  that the Marine Corps was responsible entirely for what he now was . There was Charlotte ; there was his family ; there was himself . The next day seemed to pass uneventfully . Gordon Durant attended his economics class , played squash in the afternoon , and stopped at the master 's office to begin the process of removing Lou from his rooms . The soundless machinery to bring this about slid into motion . Gordon had dinner at the Fence Club . Lou Colfax went to his Greek class , his astronomy class , and his oceanography class , and offered his usual inept performanceon the lacrosse field in the afternoon . The previous weather had held and the game was bathed for him in a ripe September shine , as promising as love , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cafeteria on Chapel Street . There were few experiences in life which Lou detested and feared more than having dinner alone . Dusk and then darkness settledover the city and the University . Wearing his black slacks and big black sweater , a tall figure , he moved quickly up lamp-lit York Street toward his college . An evening wind was mussing the crowded leaves on the trees , study-lamp light shone from the rooms in Jonathan Edwards College as he stole past it , feeling strange , outcast , fugitive . He went hurriedlyalong the walk to the entrance , through the arch , down the courtyard to the Slave Quarters , and his rooms . He was still feeling strange . Gordon Durant , glasses set purposefully on his reddish , large yet inquisitive nose , was seated in the armchair next to the fireplace , reading . He was wearing his Hong Kong dressinggown and his leather bedroom slippers , and he was clearly possessed with a sense that his life at this moment was as it should be . Lou came quickly through the door , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat down on the couch across the room , hunched forward , elbows on knees , hands clasped , looking a singular combination of woebegone and lively . Gordon gazed at him over his glasses . " I 'm well , " he finally said.  | " Well , that is good . " Lou continued to look at him expectantly , and finally Gordonsaid , " And you ? " " Not so hot . Sleep . I  --  uh  --  have to have eight and a half hours or else you know things happen to me , " his low-pitched , confiding voice went rapidly on , hands clasping and unclasping , " I guess you might say I get a little nervous  --  " " I can see you do . "  --  and I have n't been able to sleep very well here yet , there were some noises or somethingHe stopped but still gazed at Gordon , who retained his expression of laconic half-interest . " Last night I heard some noises , that 's why you found me down in the moat , I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The noises probably came from the fraternity houses . What 'd you think you 'd find at the bottom of the moat ? Water ? " " I do n't know , " Lou answered with candid humility , thus making Gordon a little uncomfortable . Haughty and earthy , crude and cultured , Gordon Durant had his own private set of reactions . Lou Colfax was simply too complicated for them . That was fundamentally why he did n't want to associate with him . " Tell me about your ancestry , " said Lou suddenly , provingthat point conclusively . " My what ? " " Ancestry . Your descent . Family tree . " After studying him , Gordon answered roughly , " You can look it up in the library , " and stared purposefully back at his book , sighing . " I have , to tell you the truth . " Gordon looked slowly up again . " A very very interesting family tree , " Lou went on intently . " Very interesting . Yes indeed . Ambassadors and senators and board chairmen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all . Who was Mr. L. R. Muller ? " After a long pause Gordon found himself answering , " My grandfather . "  | " What did he do ? " " He was a tobacco dealer in Winston-Salem , North Carolina , " he answered grimly . " Not too much money on that side of the family . " " No money at all . Are you finished with my family tree , because if you are I  --  " " Muller , Muller ? Ah good , a good Nordic . A very good Nordic name . Are you Nordic ? " " No . I 'm a Republican , " said Gordon , training a dangerous Durant glare at him . " I 'm reading . I 've arranged other  --  arrangementsabout this room  --  " Absorbing that information , which he realized he somehow already knew , Lou Colfax cut in , " You do have certain Nordic elements in your skull structure . " Gordon , louder : " So I 'm asking you to use that room in there until you move out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever-increasing throughout the past forty-eight hours , at those words became intolerable . He was going to have to retaliate . He had now become destructive . Right . He had just been reading The Totalitarian Vision and he had , of course , his photographic memory to help him . " Very Nordic , " went on Lou reflectively , leaning back and studying Gordon 's skull across the room . " In Europe , you know , " his low-pitched , penetrating voice went on , " there are six racial types  --  the Nordic , the Phalic , the Western , the Dinaric , the Eastern , and the East Baltic . " They stared at each other for a while . " You must be Phalic . A perfect Nordic skull has the proportions of length to breadth of four to three . You do n't quite make that with your skull , alas . Then . Well , the Nordic nose is small , it is set high . The skin is white , rosy white , delicate . You do n't quite make it in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You , Mr. Muller , are of the Phalic race . Sorry . Second best , Mr. Muller , second best . Pity . Yes ! Let 's see . Your face is broader , your hair is coarser . But your soul qualities , your soul qualities , Herr Muller , are similarto the Nordic . That 's why I know you and I will be such great , life-long friends . "  |p32Gordon  had his own kind of philosophical balance . " My Nordic soul is going to kick your  --  " " Ah-h-h ! Good ! Very good . Violence . V-e-e-r-r-y good . Maybe you are a true Nordic after all . Maybe you are a World Historical Individual , equal to the vastest demands of life , able to dominate them ! Blood and soil , blood and soil . Maybe you truly understand the Fiihrerprinzip after all . Do you ? The  --  ah  --  Fuhrerprinzip ? Two and two make five if the leader says so ? Do you ? " " You really are sick . " " No , no . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I , we are World Historical Individuals , we are well , well ! But you 're right , in a sense . There is sickness everywhere . The great stream of race must be protected from it . Like congenital weak-mindedness and schizophrenia , like lunacy and hereditaryepilepsy , St. Vitus dance , congenital dislocation of the hip , clubfoot , harelip , wolf 's mouth . " Suddenly he became serious , reflective , himself . " Why were the Nazis afraid of that , wolf 's mouth ? The animal inside the human . That 's it . Terrified them . " His mind engaged , he had to be serious . " It 's what they were themselves . " Always underlying his craziest flights there was this flooring of sanity , reality . It gave him what hope he had for himself . Gordon Durant just momentarily wavered in his attitude of disgusted hostility , and then thought better of it . Instantly noting this , Lou plunged back . " We Nordics , Herr Muller , are descended from the Norsemen . That 's what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Me . They were very good folk , very sound folk . They knew husbandry , and cattleraising , and sea-faring . Yes . They built impressive monuments to their dead . They dwelled in high , gabled wooden houses furnished with beds and implements . They clothed themselves in linen and twill and knew how to tan the finest leather . " By now he was using his full Prussian accent . " Zair artiztik zenz vus highly dewelopt . It zhowed itzely in zair beautivul veaponz , zee dagger , and zee battle-ax ! " " Have you finished ? " " Nein , I haf not , Herr Ortsgruppenleiter. "  |p33But  then he found that he had . There was a short silence in the sitting room , as there was in the September night outside , and Gordon idly contemplated this long black wraith before him , dark glasses , dark brown hair falling in all directions , hesitating , rattled , almost visibly vibrating from nerves , nostrilsdilating like a race-horses 's ; he reminded Gordon suddenlyof animals on his family 's stud farm , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overbred , too highstrungto function properly , a mass of nervous impulses barely held together by a desperate will , too finely distilled , a being the French would call fin de race , the end of his line , unbreedable . " Wake up , Louis , " called Clement Jonaz into Lou 's bedroomthe next morning at eight o'clock , thereby stunning him awake . Immediately concealing his dazed condition  --  to let anyone else notice weakness in him might be risky , he felt  --  he sat up in bed and said calmly , " Oh hi . Hello . What 's new ? " " I was just passing by and I saw your roommate , the Student Prince , stalking away into the dawn and so I thought I 'd come in and see how you were . " " And we came too , " said Richard Anders brightly , sticking his head into the bedroom and indicating Brooks Randell behind him . " You wanted to see how I was ? " Lou said drily . " Now you know . I was sleeping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Never mind . " By reputation a loner , Lou eagerly valued the company of those few people he knew well , and even more important , those few people who knew him well . Brooks Randell , rather short and blond , plump but alert , sauntered into the room . " We thought maybe you 'd be having your breakfast moat exercise . " Lou got out of bed , laughing nervously . He stood up , a tall , lean figure in jockey shorts , with a strong body but an attenuatedone , as though nature had taken an athlete 's body and stretched it three or four inches too much.  |p34He  yawned at himself in the dresser mirror . Lou was aware that he did not even yawn the way other people did , that there was a peculiar extra tautness to his yawn . " Let 's have some coffee , " he said . There was a hot plate in the living room . He made some instant coffee for them , found some not-yet-stale doughnuts , and then he climbed back into his bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started a Tuesday morning , " remarked Brooks , following Lou into his room . " What am I doing here ? " " Sit down there by the desk , " said Lou cordially . " How are things with you ? IIow do you stand with the draft ? " " Do n't talk about it , " Brooks muttered . " Korea ! Ugh ! What the hell are we doing over there ! " Richard came in and sat on the floor . Clement stationed himself on the windowsill . Lou was having almost his first happy moment since returning to Yale . He knew that he had a male streak of narcissism and a male streak of infantilism in his nature . That was why he loved to sit in bed in the morning with friends around him , feeling like a little boy being the center of attention , and also like a young king , the King of France , at his ceremonial morning levee at Versailles , respectfully attended by the assembledcourtiers . " You 're looking better this morning , " observed Brooks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sickly , " said Richard . " Well , pale . " " I 'm getting adjusted to this environment again , " said Lou thoughtfully . " I 'm like a tree . If you transplant me I shed my leaves for a while . Then they start to grow again . " And then he gave them several of his theories about plant life and evolution , and then naturally moved on to the sea and the fertility of " abyss water " if it could be brought to the surface and the Benthic Boundary and how the tides if understood could explain the origin of the moon and so preclude the necessity of going there and how the ocean floor held a complete history of the development of earth , carefullyp35pressed and preserved there under water : all of this came out very fast and casually , lest they should be put off by his erudition ; but these three students were not put off , not at all , but after a while they had to leave and Lou sat still in the bed , aware that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not the complete laughingstock of Pierson College after all , that there was far more to him than being foolish . He had known this all along , of course , and Clement had known it , and now Brooks and Richard knew it too . Gordon Durant did n't know it . Lou was always a good and sometimes a phenomenal student . If only he would n't forget to go to some course in economics or something week after week , his academic record would have been distinguished . If only he would remember . But Lou always forgot , lost , one course each term . This term it might be Introductory Geology . It was not a science which interested him . He was interested in water , currents , oceans , troughs , fish , algae , the tidal pull of the moon , the world-encircling currents , the fabulous curl of surf . Why did it happen ? That the ocean should roll itself over its own undertow , arch and build and then crash and run out and finally recede : the configuration of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , power , vitality , uncontrollability . But Introductory Geology ? Rocks ? Nevertheless he decided to try , and so he presented himself for the lecture that morning . There were approximately five hundred students on the ground floor and in the balcony of the lecture hall . They slid into their deskchairs and began to sip coffee from cardboard cups , read the New York Times or the Herald Tribune , or to resume sleep . It was nine o'clock . Almost everyone slumped , American-style , except Lou . Knowledge deserved respect , even geology , until proved otherwise . The lecture , illustrated with slides , began , delivered by a small and nervous man who looked smaller because of the vastness of the auditorium , and more nervous because ofp36the size , virility , and famous impatience of the student body . Two attitudes dominated student reaction to teachers : impatienceand torpor . Lou Colfax , nervously sketching crosssectionsof human skulls in his notebook ( " If you die before me , " he once told a girl he may have been in love with , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , put your skull over my face and see through your eye sockets  --  real togetherness . " " Ugh ! You ghoul ! " ) , heard the lecturer mention volcanoes and his attentionsnapped to the podium . Behind the small black figure of the lecturer was projected a very large and very majestic view of Mount Fujiyama , its flanks rising with the great inevitabilityof a work of art to the upper snows and finally to the climactic crater ; it was thrilling , he reflected , this massive sweep of nature , this volcano , the greatest fountain conceivable , a mystical link to the core -- a great big pimple on the face of the earth , " his hearing registered from the podium . A GREAT BIG PIMPLE ! A GREAT BIG PIMPLE ! A memory preempted his outraged mind . The previous December , stationed as a Marine in Hawaii , he had gone up Mauna Loa Volcano to the very lip of the Halemaumau fire pit . It was growing dark as he approached it and a reddish , hellish glow radiated from the crater into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rickety viewing platform very near the edge of the crater ; the earth around it was fissured , imperceptibly separating itself from solid ground before plunging , some day , into the vast pit below . Hugely nervous but unstoppably attracted , Private Louis Colfax took his place on the wooden platform among five other speechless viewers . And finally , when someone did speak , it was in the hushed tones of those on the scene of a coronation or a hanging . Lou gazed fixedly down into the pit perhaps three hundred feet below as the wave of heat from it hit all along the front of his body while the chilly night air still clung to his back . On the floor of the pit , rolling yellow lava slowly moved outwards from the center , inching across an older , solider black lava field webbed with golden streams . Near the centerp37of the floor fountains of new lava shot up from time to time a hundred feet or more within the great crater to create this golden flow , and the noise of these eruptions , distant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disembodied , unrelated . How crazy , he suddenly realized perched over this uncanny uproar , to think that a volcano sounds unearthly . It was the essence of earth being flung up before his eyes , golden , liquid rock . The creation of the universe was continuing before his eyes . He stood , unspeakably thrilled , and at last suddenly realizedthe underlying reason for his excitement . This was the ultimate , uncontrollable force on earth . No fence could stop it , no wall , no channel . No will could stop it , no bomb . No one could pass any laws against its flow . It could not be decreased or deflected or interfered with in any way . It blew out of the center of the earth with its unknowable roar , its voice reverberating the chaos of the inner earth , and it spoke with the unanswerable voice : it asked no questions ; it spoke chaos ; no contradiction or even comment was possible ; it spoke creation ; it brooked no interference ; all the science in the world and all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all government and all thought waited helplessly before it to see what it would do , where it would go , when , if ever , it would pause . A beast in the menagerie of earth , it obscurely thrilled Lou Colfax. .. . sometimes the pimple gets squeezed inside and then  --  pop !  --  out comes the  --  ah  --  lava . " Slowly , almost regretfully , Lou closed his notebook on his skull sketches , stood up , picked his way across the legs strewn like badly piled logs in front of his row of seats , reached the aisle , and walked out of Introductory Geology . A pimple ! Lou left Strathcona Hall and walked swiftly back across this hodge-podge , this medley , the University campus . It happened to be a perfect September morning in Connecticut , that is , a perfect morning . Its fresh hopefulness filled him with unfocused resoluteness , faceless gods , purposeless drive . Hep38felt unearthly ; he felt he was going to explode . Entering his sitting room in Pierson College he found GordonDurant burning the Soviet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gordon looked as close to being disconcerted as it was possible for him to do . " I 've got somebodycoming to sec me , " he explained gruffly , " so I had to get rid of this joke of yours . " The Soviet flag had indeed been a joke , but the burning of it was n't . " What are you going to burn next ? " Lou inquired quietly . " My clothes ? " After a pause Gordon replied brusquely , " It 's a thought . Do you have any besides those black pants and that goddam black sweater ? " Quite emphatically Lou replied , " No , " and stood looking at him . " I have some old things you might use  --  " Gordon began urbanely . " Go to hell . Take that property of mine out of the fire . " After gazing at him for a moment Gordon said , " Are you serious ? I wo n't have that thing in the place where I live . " Thereupon Lou picked up the first piece of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Charvet sports jacket , and threw it on top of the flaming flag . Gordon tried to lunge simultaneously for Lou and for the jacket and tripped clumsily between the two , swearing . Then Lou , not from fear of Gordon but fear of his own temper , went into isolation . On the far side of the fireplace was the bathroom ; Lou disappeared into it and locked the door . There followed an interval of commotion and some yelling from the living room , but after a short time silence fell . Then Lou thought he heard someone enter the sitting room from outside , heard a woman 's voice call , " Gordon ! Where are you , Gordon ? " Heard heels move around the room , heard them pause on the other side of the bathroom door , and then heard tapping on the door . " Gordon , darling , are you in there ? " Silence . The handle of the door was tried . Locked . " You are in there ! Say something , my love . It 's Norma  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone in there ? Really , Gordon , and in the morning ! " Her voice was low-pitched , penetrating , and very beguiling . She spoke with some kind of pronounced accent , a Mediterranean accent . Who in hell was she ? ( " I 've got somebody coming to see me . " Who ? ) Calling on his talent for mimicry , he said in a Gordon growl : " Out in a minute . Wait in the Common Room . " " No , darling , I am going to wait exactly here . " Balked silence from the bathroom . " You never listen to me . Now you listen , nothing else for you to do . Marvelous . Now I am happy . No , I am miserable now , and you must try to help me . Will you help me ? " Pristine silence . " Because  --  who else can , I ask you ? Augustus ? Of course not . How can he , on his honeymoon , after all ? And with the alimony trouble  --  I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lawyer I have , well , why do I pay him except to take his advice ? Augustus is angry , of course he is angry , naturally , and so everyone stays away from me out of fear of him . I have no friends , no life now , darling I have no lover at all , it 's terrible , I am becoming like a nun almost  --  will you believe this ? Like a virgin again . I want to kill myself every morning for the first half an hour , until after coffee , and then mylongings  --  " Lou began desperately flushing the toilet , turning on the faucets full blast , turning on the shower . The bathroom rather rapidly began to fill up with steam . Who was this crazy woman ? How was he going to get her out of the room so that he could escape ? Why had n't he identified himself at once instead of doing that mad imitation of Durant ? But he knew it was not in his nature to have behaved , in this situation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the water , first the hot water so that the steam and the heat of the little bathroom would diminish to endurable levels , and then , hearing nothing outside , he turned off the water entirely . Perfect silence reigned in the living room . He unlocked the door and stepped carefully out . A lady satp40on the couch gazing with a level stare at him , and Gordon Durant stood beside the embers of the fireplace , slowly fishing at his sports jacket with a poker . The woman seated on the couch had shapely long legs , lithe and tanned . At first he could n't really see anything else about her . Then he saw that she had blond hair falling to her shoulders , big eyes  --  furious big eyes  --  that she must be in her middle thirties , fascinating-looking ; her hands were clenched , separately , on her thighs . Then she stood up . She was slim and rather tall . She wore some kind of light green dress . " Who are you ? " she inquired in a low , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fairly wide mouth . Definite Mediterranean accent . Silence . " Answer me ! " she yelled . " Who the hell are you ! " She moved toward him . " I 'm nobody , " he was disgusted to hear himself quickly mutter . " Who did you say he was ? " she said scornfully , turning toward Gordon . " He just told you . " " Listening to my confidential things , you sneak , you little  --  you goddam little twerp ! Why the hell did n't you say Gordon was n't here ! Imitating his voice ! You  --  you lousy racketeer ! " Lou could sense that cascades of devastating epithets in Italianor Spanish or whatever her language was hung on the brink of exploding into the room . He watched entranced as she strode up and down the room like a caged panther , and although he suspected that , despite her rage , she was watching him watching her and faintly pleased by his admiration , he did n't care . He also sensed that she found him attractive , had responded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curiosity about her banished his embarrassment and alarm , and he asked , in all simple directness , " Who are you ? " Instantly she stopped striding , took a long look , full of some sort of significance , at him , staring directly into his eyes , her hands unclenched , she giggled very faintly , tossed back her hair , and finally answered . " Me ? I am nobody too , I think . "  |p41She  came over to him , moving more calmly now . " I believe I tripped you in there . You did n't know what to do . You were trapped . You did n't know how to get this crazy woman away tram the door , so you try the imitation . " She threw back her head and laughed loudly . " Then what did you do in there ? " " I just sat there thinking . " ller mood flashed change again . " So . That 's where you think , that 's what happens in there . Students think there . I believe it , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days . " She laughed loudly again , and ran her hand lightly along the side of his face . Turning to , or rather on , Gordon Durant , she said , " Do n't just stand there stirring your jacket , introduce us to each other . " " Colfax , Mrs. Talourni Durant . " " Your sister ? " he inquired with continuing simplicity . Do n't ask me any direct questions , Gordon 's scowl answered . " Oh darling , " Mrs. Taloumi Durant said to Gordon in her vibrant voice , " do n't be so bombastic . Is that the word I want ? Ah , no . I mean  --  do n't be so pompous . Yes . Pompous . Do n't be so pompous , darling . " He rattled the poker moodily . Her eyes lighted with amusement , she asked , " Is n't your jacket done yet ? " " You may think it 's funny , " he answered heavily , " but I 'm living in the same quarters with this  --  " His grimace supplied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all . " She turned her large eyes on Louis Colfax . " Do I look like his sister to you ? " " No . " " You are right . " She sat down decisively where she had been before , pulled a package of Gauloise cigarettes out of a large pocketbook , and lit one , squinting across the smoke of it up at him . Lou noticed that she liked to squint this way : there was something masculine about it that she obscurely enjoyed in herself . " I 'm his ex-stepmother ! What do you think of that ! " Her voice was so hypnotic in its penetrating pitch , its enerSIMIMPsimp.  |p42getic  sensuousness , that the meaning of the words only slowly filtered through it into Lou 's consciousness . Finally he replied , " I 've never met an ex-stepmother before . " She laughed abruptly at that . " You hear that ! " she demanded of Gordon . " He 's honest , he 's direct ! " Turning to Lou , " I think you are one American I might understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Gordon Durant'smortification at this compliment paid to Louis Colfax almost visibly disturbed the room . " Keep quiet , Gordon , you do n't understand nothing ! You resemble your father too much . " To Lou : " Do you know why his father divorce me ? " Lou 's face registered a thunderstruck negative . " Because I am too permissive ! Yes . Yeeesss ! YES . Too permissive ! You believe that ? Do you ? " Lou nodded hurriedly , lest she bite him . All female once more , she spread a wide smile over him . " I think you do understand me . That 's why you fight with this pig , my ex-stepson , no . Of course it is . He ca n't understand nothing . It runs with the family . " " Runs in the family , " Lou murmured . " Yes . His father , when I let him go out without me at night , let him stay out all night if he want , I do n't care , he is a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinks I do n't love him any more , thinks I never loved him , or else I would fight and scream and cry and be the little spoiled American wife when he stay out all night . " " That was only a small part of it , " Gordon Durant felt himself forced to comment . " And I wish you would n't discuss family business here . " " He already knows everything . I tell him everything while he was in the bathroom . Women like me , " she went on , squinting into the fire , blowing smoke meditatively toward it , " do n't know what we want , I think . With a man who makes very little money we say , You ca n't support me as you should . You are a failure . ' With a man like Gordon 's father , who has much money , we say , You only have money . You neglect everything for money . You are a failure . ' We are all bitches , I think . What do you think ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answering , " it is just a roundaboutway of saying the man does n't interest you , disapproving about the money is just a way of saying it . " She gazed fixedly at him , and for a moment he thought she was going to kiss him . " How you know so much ? " Ile was silent . He thought of a girl named Charlotte , and as usual the thought of her ruined him . " Colfax is full of shit if you do n't mind my saying so come on Norma I 'm taking you to lunch so long Colfax , " Gordon said evenly without breathing or pause . She got up . " I always obey this terrible family . I do n't know why . It 's not because of their money . " She touched Lou 's cheek again . " Do n't let him intimidate you . You understand many things . You have  --  ach , I do n't know the word in English  --  well , gifts , yes . I think you have gifts . " The two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood wordless . Then Gordon more or less dragged her out the door . Lou , tall , lean , and solitary in his black clothes , stared into the mixed tatters in the fireplace . She had made him feel infinitely better about himself for a moment . It was a feeling which might have lasted , with luck , for about five minutes , if Charlotte had n't been invoked . He would never see Mrs. Taloumi Durant again , of course . Gordon would see to that . Did he really have something to offer anyone ? Or was n't he Mr. Nobody , certified as such by the Marine Corps , Yale  --  his family . . . Charlotte . . . . He probed among the embers with the poker , and found a scrap of the flag . He fished it out . " Somebody will master perpetual motion one of these days , " Lou murmured to himself as he sketched a modification of his perpetual motion project at two the following morning . RichardAnders and Brooks Randell slumped at opposite ends of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed for a time Lou 's most promising attack on the problem , because it wasp44based , not on machinery at all , but upon two ceaseless and eternal forces of nature , osmosis and precipitation . He had decided at the outset of this hobby that perpetual motion could only be achieved by linking the motion directly to natural forces , naturally . Part of his fascination with Mauna Loa Volcano had been because of this , quickly expiring becausevolcanoes so obviously were born , lived , and died . " How does your perpetual motion machine work ? " Richard asked , keeping his face very straight indeed and his tone serious . Lou shot one swift but infinitely weary glance at him , the weariness of someone who had been baited by others from earliest childhood because his interests were so singular . He had never known anyone 's batting average or anything else about baseball , but he had known all there was to know about Piceard 's bathyscaphe . That had not helped his popularity at all . Richard Anders , aware of this particular vulnerability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question with the greatest care . Noting this seriousness , touched , slightly unnerved by encounteringthis kindness here , or anywhere , Lou answered softly , " It 's based on osmosis . You have a pool of water with a porous pole in the middle , and the water rises by osmosis up the pole , spreads naturally through a porous disc at the top , is turned to rain in a kind of involved way  --  that 's where it looks like the whole theory breaks down  --  falls back into the pool , rises by osmosis up the pole again and so on , a continuing circle of moving water , perpetual because it 's based on naturalforces . " He looked down again at his sketches . " It 's not going to work because of the rain part , and I think the whole conception was too simplistic at the start anyway . " Richard doubted that . Nothing about Lou Colfax was simplistic . " Let 's take a road trip , " Lou said suddenly , staring at them . " All right , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " To my house , " Lou answered . He made his Frankenstein face . " It 's been empty for over a year , " and throwing back his head released his extremely faithful version of the laugh of a homicidal maniac . From Gordon Durant 's bedroom , feetp45could be heard hitting the floor heavily , the door opened , and Durant appeared in his French silk pajamas , fists on hips . " What the screw was that ! Colfax , this is the end . You 're under arrest . I 'm making a citizen 's arrest . I 'm dead serious . You two freaks are witnesses . I 'm bringing charges . " Overcome by many feelings , Lou could only stand immobilized . He had made a complete nuisance and fool of himself again , outraging once again this new incarnation , the ex-stepsonof Mrs. Taloumi Durant . Richard Anders had the talent and the personal aura of a peacemaker . He knew how to placate even an enraged member of the Durant family . A quarter of an hour later , Lou @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Haven in Lou 's Morgan toward backcountryConnecticut , and the Black House . The house did not exist in Lou 's mind except in relation to Charlotte Mills . He had always disliked that name so much , even in the months when no one seemed to exist in the world except Charlotte Mills , even then he had disliked her name . Perhaps it had been a label  --  Poison , Keep Out of the Reach of Children  --  which he should have noticed and heeded , instead of drinking every last drop and licking his fingers afterward . Charlotte Mills . What an ugly name it always was . " The Black House " was n't exactly the most beguiling name in the world either . Still , these two , Charlotte and the house , had been absolutely everything beautiful and lovable to him during the only months of his life which had ever mattered , ever been lived . He had not dared even to consider revisiting the house until two o'clock on this particular morning , on the most sudden of impulses , with these two good-natured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circumstances , because he hoped to evade its power this way , catch it off guard and prosaic , find its shimmering spell gone , its power broken , find that it had become once again just his crazy old Aunt Alice 's slatternly old house , just a place to go on weekendsand be bored in , and not , as it used to be with Charlotte , the boiling core of the universe.  |p46Lou  forced the little English car  --  it had always reminded him desperately of Charlotte , this frail , terribly fast , springless , risky little English car  --  over the roads , and it brought them rattling through the stunned , empty streets of the town , past the Green , along through the tunnel of old trees on Main Street , to the narrow side road , the gravel road branching off that , the dirt road branching off that , and finally the old track leading bumpily upward to the Black House itself , still forlornlythere , more slatternly-looking than ever , standing in the clearing alone , with a bone-deep Colfax aloneness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only thing his family ever had and doubtless ever would bequeath to him , rickety , frail , haunted . It was not black on the outside , but a dull , dark green , high-gabled , a sagging porch on three sides with a roof supported by thin poles , sitting in its unkempt clearing alone . It was truly isolated , because Aunt Alice could not afford it otherwise , and because she profoundly wished it not to be otherwise . No telephone lines led to it . No sewer led away from it . No electricity linked it to the grids of New England , no water mains to a reservoir anywhere.  |p47It  was an old house , some people said eighty years old , mane said much older than that . The Morgan came bumping up to it ; its headlights raked the front porch and dark windows , the louvered double doors , a desolate " glider " on the front porch , two large and innumerablesmall flower pots with dead stalks in them . There was an old sense of emptiness everywhere , but not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was holding fast to something in its interior , a secret or a treasure or a memory . There was no feeling of an abandonment about it ; just an overpowering feeling of isolation , of holding fast to some bleak inner fact . They climbed out of the car rather wearily , for like all road trips which start in impulse and hilarity , this one had degeneratedby the time the goal was reached into weariness , discomfort , and regret . The clean , or almost clean , sheets of their beds in Pierson College were recollected by Richard and Brooks , and the latter began to say , " Maybe we can have a quick look around and then drive back  --  " when Lou Colfax interrupted : " This house is haunted , of course . Some people are afraid to spend the night here , I mean , you know , girls , " and that settled that . They crossed the rickety porch , and Lou inserted the old key in the old lock . It turned and he stepped into the black room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lamp where it should be , struck a match and lighted it , and a certain amount of wavery illumination spread over the room . " Be it ever so humble , " Brooks said , " there 's no place like a shack . " Lou stood holding the kerosene lamp at the center of its perimeter of rather uncertain light . The house was exactly as it had been . Apparently it was too glum and shabby-looking for even tramps or teen-agers to break into . It was exactly , exactly as it had been . Lou stood immobile with the lamp , not knowing whether he was exactly as he had been then , or not , but deeply fearing that he was , that he was the human shred Charlotte hadp48walked out on here . The blood which flowed from the slice he made in his stomach must still stain the floor over there . Looking more than ever like an overbred race-horse , unbreedable , he stood still for a second longer , and then stepped forward yelling comically , " Haunted ! Spooks everywhere ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the three of them moved to the center of the room . The walls were the dull black Lou had painted them when he inherited the house two years before . On the left wall , Aunt Alice 's will , which she had written there , was still faintly visible beneath the paint . But on the opposite wall , which had always been completelybare , someone had written something in large white letters . Someone had also stuck something , a snapshot , onto the wall beneath the writing . Seeing Lou 's face as he beheld this , Brooks said hurriedly , " What the hell is that ? " " It 's not in Aunt Alice 's handwriting , " replied Lou with a faint laugh . They moved up to it . " Dear Lou , " it read in a legible chalk script , " Welcome home ! This is a photo of Mark . Love , Charlotte , " and the rather blurred snapshot beneath showed her holding a blanket with an infant in it . She had also dated the message : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brooks said , " Which one of your crazy relatives is Charlotte ? " Lou glared at the words and the picture . " Which one is she ? " Brooks repeated . Lou continued to glare for a while and then he muttered , " She was a girl friend of mine once . " " So the little baby is  --  " Brooks suddenly saw a really ripe situation loom up ; a giggle began to rise in him , " is the little tyke  --  ? " " Keep your mouth shut , " Lou said evenly . " Of course not . Who knows , she must be married by now . When was she here ? " he demanded in a more intense voice . " ' Tuesday . ' That 's Charlotte . What Tuesday ? Last week ? Last year ? "  | " Sort of an unusual girl friend . Leaves a note for you on the wall ! " " She knew about Aunt Alice 's will . It was a joke . This is a joke . There is n't any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a joke . " He turned to stare at Brooks . After thinking that over and studying Lou 's face , Brooks said , " It is n't even funny . " There was a silence . " She went to an awful lot of trouble . " Brooks paused again and his wellproportionedmind reexamined the available evidence . " What if it is a real baby ? It looks kind of real to me . " " What if it is ? I have n't seen her since before the Marine Corps . She 's married by now . " He turned away to contemplate the darkness , " or else she got knocked up . " His mouth would only form these last words very clumsily . Brooks continued to look inquiringly at him . Then he echoed , " or else she got knocked up . " Lou came unleashed . " Who asked stupid you any questions ! " he shouted . " Talk about overreacting , " said Brooks in a wondering voice . " Take it easy , Louis . Excuse me . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sidelong glance at Lou . " After all , it 's none of my business . " " Tuesday ! " snarled Lou quietly to himself . " Tuesday . " He sat down on an automobile seat , which served as a couch , under the message on the wall . In the feeble light the oval black table in the center of the room did n't look as plain as it really was , the two straight-backed wooden chairs next to it , the automobile seat against the opposite wall , the worn , round , hooked rug , the splintered wooden floor , painted black ; Aunt Alice 's objet d'art , a huge glass case containing a many-branched imitation tree on the limbs of which dozens of real stuffed birds perched , musty , frayed , some of them decayedand spilling their stuffing  --  a swallow and a woodpeckerand an owl and a redbird and a sandpiper , a peacock , a sea gull , a thrush , a hummingbird , a finch , a lark , a redshaftedflicker , a bird of paradise , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jaybird , and many others.  | " I think it 's illegal to kill and stuff birds like that , " observed Richard , to change the subject . " I 'm sure it is , " said Lou warmly , grateful for the change . " Aunt Alice would n't have wanted anything strictly normal and legal . Also , she hated birds . A cat-lover , remember ? " The two doors in the rear wall led to the two bedrooms , and a third door in the rear left corner led to a kind of shed attached to the house which served as Aunt Alice 's kitchen , and a fourth door in the right rear corner led to another shed , the privy . There was a trap door in the ceiling of the main room which gave access to a capacious , sloping attic . Brooks and Richard discovered two cots in the left bedroom and fell into them , clothes still on , and in the fatigue of post-road-trip depression , they were quickly asleep . Lou went into the other bedroom , where there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tubular brass headboard , a high , forbidding chest of drawers , a frivolous little dressing table , a valuable armoire , purple draperies , pink wallpaper , a red rug : Aunt Alice 's boudoir . There were also three small chairs covered in chintz . Lou slowly got out of his black sweater , black slacks , his T-shirt , loafers , and got into the sheetless bed . After a long time Charlotte came out of the wall and talked with him about the condition of the house , its lack of amenities , and said , " I was here on Tuesday , " in her clear English way , " Tuesday , Tuesday . " She told him he did n't look well and then went on to other subjects , and in dealing with her Lou got out of bed and went into the main room where Richard found him there circling the table slowly , still asleep , and led him back to the bedroom . Charlotte liked Aunt Alice 's bedroom at once , the first time she saw it . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what ? Dotty ? " " It 's that too , love , but it 's also dolly . It makes me feel I would have liked your Aunt Alice . Pity I never met her . When did you say she died ? "  | " Last year . She would n't have liked you . " " Whyever not ? " she asked with mock indignation . " She used to say small women could n't be trusted . " " You did say she was paranoid . I forgot . " " I think mad people have a lot of insight sometimes . " " Then you think I 'm not to be trusted too ? " After a pause , he said , " Yes . " She scrutinized her delicate face in the mirror of the dressingtable . " You may be right . I believe you are right . Do n't trust me . " " Do n't worry , I wo n't . I 'm just like my aunt . " " Paranoid ? " " Tremendously . Is n't everybody ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explicitly . Hell , I even trust you . " " Then you really are crazy . " " Flow can you bear to leave this dolly house and go live in that college ? " " I live in a place called Dirty Durfee Hall on the Old Campus . It 's the worst place they have there , and it 's ten times as comfortable as this . " " Still you like it here . I can tell . " After a silence he said , " I love it here , it 's true . I do n't know why . Aunt Alice was so crazy , it makes me feel , I do n't know , " then he finished apologetically , " better about myself . " " Do you really think you 're dotty ? Tell me , so I 'll be prepared , with the proper injection or whatever . " Lou contemplated autumn through the bedroom window . " What do you think ? " he finally asked carefully . " I do n't know , " Charlotte answered forthrightly . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours , so how could I be expected to know . You do n't seem batty exactly . More highstrung , and , I do n't know , unusual . Original , that 's it . You 're what the Italians call un originale , I think . " Brooks and Richard woke up first and instead of disturbing Lou , who was at last profoundly asleep after his sleep/walking , they examined the kitchen shed , found that the gas ring was working , and deduced that , if supplied with the raw materials , a breakfast could be prepared there . Richard found the keys to the Morgan in the ignition , Lou always leaving keys in locks since that 's where they fitted best . As Richard was returning from town with the breakfast supplies he saw a woman walking along the dirt road toward the Black House . She was rather tall and heavy , perhaps fifty years old . She wore a long , closely fitted bright green dress reaching well below the knee , and she carried a large hat . Her wavy hair was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bag until he stopped alongside her because she flagged him down , and noticed that her face and head were delicately modeled , too small for her body , vulnerable . " Hi there ! " she called out in a warm and resounding voice . " You 're going to Louie 's house . Oh good ! " She got into the car . " Hi there , " she persisted . " I 'm Louie 's Aunt Lydia . Of course I 'm not an aunt at all , I 'm his father 's first cousin but it 's easier just to say aunt since I 'm , well , almost old enough to be his aunt . Who 're you ? I saw the car outside the house this morning when I went by to get my mail and thought I 'd just sort of stop in . Is that house liveable ? I have all the cats up home , all eleven that survived , that is . You know about Alice 's seventeen cats ? Louie made me take them , sent me money out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it the Coast Guard ?  --  so that I 'd get them proper food . Was n't that a sweet thing to do ? Still , five or six died off and one thing and another .... Here we are ! My , it looks bad . Alice never was a housekeeper . Louie , Louie ! " Lou once again was wrenched out of one of his deep , almost desperate sleeps . Louie ! No one on earth ever called him that detestable version of his first name except " Aunt " Lydia , the failed television performer . Oh , brother ! Breakfast was set on the battered oval table in the front room : orange juice , fried eggs , Canadian bacon , cinnamon rolls , and lots of coffee and milk . Both Brooks and Richard belonged to the big-breakfast minority at Yale . Lydia spread herself in the armchair , the two friends sat onp53straight-back chairs , and Lou , wrapped in a raincoat which served as a bathrobe for him here , sat opposite Lydia , eating with his usual ravenous speed . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terrible , " she began cheerfully , " just like the house . Terrible . " He continued eating ; so did she . " I 've already had breakfast . I do n't think the Marines did a thing for you . How did you like it ? I was in South Carolina once , lovely , all those old plantations and places and those old trees with the moss hanging on them . Messy people , those Southern people . I 'll bet you 're glad to be back . " Here she **26;12932;TOOLONG and looked at him for a response . His mouth full , Lou affirmatively brightened his eyes and flexed his ears . " Oh , fine . This house is a disgrace . When do you want the cats back ? I think there 's about ten or eleven left . They 're happier here . " Lou swallowed in a gulp . " Eleven ! " He stared with a pained expression at her . " Eleven ! What happened ? " " What do you mean , What happened ? ' " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are .. gone ? " He stared in suspense at her . " How do I know which ones are gone ? Maybe it 's only five . How do I know ? They come in , they go out , they get in fights and get all scarred , they have kittens  --  " " Oh . You have replacements . " Lou brightened . " How many kittens are there ? " " Oh , I drowned the kittens , " she said , not looking at him , her brusque cheerfulness ringing false . " Could n't have any more cats underfoot . " Lou held absolutely still for several seconds as the waves of dejection and fury at this went through him , and then without looking at Lydia he continued mechanically to eat . Noticing all this , she resumed in full good humor : " You 're the limit , Louie ! Never coming up here to see anybody . When was the last time you saw your father ? " " A while ago . " " Is n't that the limit ? And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even seen your own father . " " We got here at three o'clock this morning  --  "  | " And him sitting morning till night , all alone , watching TV . What kind of son is that ? Well , you 're just like all the rest of the family . Selfish as sharks . Selfish as sharks . " She took in the two listeners with her bright blue eyes , smiling her inscrutable smile . Richard decided she looked rather like a peroxide VirginiaWoolf . " I used to be on TV . Did you ever happen to view my show ? It originated in Hartford , but we reached New Haven . " " I do n't know , " said Richard . " What kind of show was it ? " " You do n't know , " she repeated in a drawling tone , giving him a cat-like glance , and then , quickly friendly again , went on . " Homemaker type , mostly . We called it , Stitches in Time at first , but the producer said that went over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we just called it , Homemaker 's Day . That did n't go over anybody 's head . I sang . Oh just a little , at first , " Tea for Two " and numbers like that , and did some cooking and dress patterns and interviews and , well , it lasted for a while , not too bad , thirteen weeks . Somebody else 's doing it now . So Louie 's father sits there staring at TV morning to night . " She sat silent for several seconds and then suddenly remarked in an entirely new tone of voice , " Funny , you three students sneaking up here in the middle of the night like this . Almost like you were running away . Peculiar . Very odd . But then Louie always did pick odd ones for friends . " She seemed to be ruminating aloud . " Birds of a feather ... " Lou was glaring at her , trying to hypnotize her out of the destructive mood which had just seized her . All the women in his family seemed to have it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strangers such as Brooks and Richard . Damn her and all of them ; he should never have come back here , stepped back into their negation of a world . " Aunt Lydia , " he said quietly , " they 're neither one of them a bit odd , at least by . . . uh . . . our standards . Richard 's very active in Dwight Hall , which means he 's very sound , and Brooks is very sound too . They only seem odd to you because , well , you 're very preoccupied with oddness always , are n't you ? " He would just let her chew on that . She beheld him . " Left the Coast Guard awfully fast , didn'tp55von ? Before your term was up . Odd . Oh . But my lands , " her face changed , merriment returned to her blue eyes , " what awful breakfast-table talk . I used to say on my program , ' Girls , never let the men get serious at breakfast . The whole day will be infected . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I rom all over thanking me for the advice . What do you study ? " she asked Brooks , bright eyes trained on him . " Economics is my major  --  " " Not home economics , I bet -- or is it ? " she added in an edgy voice . Then all amiability again , " Now there I could help you out , if you were a girl and it was home economics . But the other kind , the money kind , I 'm not too good at , and neither is Louie for that matter and neither is his father or any of the family . " She took a swallow of black coffee . " Louie tell you about the family ? " Lou observed her moving toward destructiveness again . " Aunt Lydia , they would n't be interested in that . Maybe you and I should go up to your place and get the cats . " She beamed at him for a while , and then her bright eyes lifted their gaze above his head and onto the black wall with the white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had not noticed it before . Lou realized that she had stored it , as a squirrel would an acorn , for a needy moment . Now that moment had arrived : she was about to be asked to leave . " How 's Mark ! " she suddenly yelled . " How 's little Mark ? Is n't Charlotte something , writing it on the wall just like poor Alice wrote her last will and testament . Past and future , past and future . Is n't it funny ? Right here on opposite walls of the Black House . " Lou was staring transfixed at her . " Little Mark , so cute . " Her face , all one big smile , beamed across at him . " Always so , I do n't know , touching for an old bag like me to- " her voice began to trail off , " see the  --  ah  --  family go on ... ah . . . hmmm , " and she pursed her thin lips and let her unfocused gaze wander . Lou carefully extracted a cigarette from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He inhaled and then blew out the smoke . He hated smoking and almost never smoked . Through the exhaled smoke he looked across at Lydia Colfaxp56and said as calmly as he could , " I have n't seen that baby . " " You have n't ! " Lydia looked theatrically thunderstruck . " Is that so ! I declare ! " " No , I have n't . " He paused , and then continued with the same leaden calmness , " Did you see Charlotte when she was here ? " Lydia nodded happily , like a little girl . " When was that ? " Lydia rolled her eyes upward , back and forth across the black ceiling of the room , and finally let them swing down again onto Lou 's face . " I calculate it was about eight months after you left for the Coast Guard . " " Marines , " corrected Richard tersely . " About eight months after you two broke up , if I have my dates right . " Lou found himself grinding out the once-puffed cigarette in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  uh  --  you saw this  --  baby of hers , I guess ? " " Oh yes . " Silence . By great self-control , Lou prevented himself from reaching for another cigarette . Hunching forward in his chair , chin down , he looked up at her and said , " Was her husband with her ? " After a thoughtful silence , she answered hesitantly , " No , he did n't come . " Perfectly concealing the fact that learning that she had a husband was both a huge relief and a final despair , Lou managed an almost jaunty smile and said , " I guess she wanted me to know she was married and happy  --  it was that Broadwayproducer she married , I guess  --  " he barely glanced at Lydia as he awaited this final blow from her ; she nodded very slightly ; destroyed , he went on almost jauntily , " I guess she wanted me to know she was married and that they had this  --  this little boy . That 's why she  --  " he waved at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face , and then she said as though clearing her throat , " She did n't say about that . Just wanted the baby to come here , to see this house . That 's what she wanted . She wanted the baby to be in this house . " Shep57swallowed a gulp of coffee . " Well now , what about those cats ? They want to be back here , " her eyes shone brightly again , " back home , back , you know , where they belong . All living creatures want to be where they belong , that right ? " Early in October Lou had brought Charlotte up to the Black House for a second visit . Turning into the dirt road leading to it they saw a small child , perhaps three years old , sitting alone by the side of the road . Lou jerked the car to a stop and was out of it and bending over the child in moments . Charlotte followed . It was a little girl , and Lou picked her up as though she were made of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he eventually gathered that she belonged to a family living not far from his house . They drove there , Lou making comic noises for the child all the way . At the door of the house the mother , who had many children , thanked them but did not seem surprised that the little girl had wanderedoff . " What kind of a mother is that ? " Lou demanded , back in the car . " She could have gotten run over ! I might have run over her ! " and he began fumbling around the dashboard to see if there were any cigarettes . Later on , at the house , to get his mind off it , Charlotte said , " For a freshman at Yale you spend an enormous amount of time in this peculiar little house in the wood . " " Do n't you like it ? " " I love it . Why would n't I ? Whatever you might think , I 'm at heart domestic . Do you believe that ? " " No , not a word . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true . But he did not want it to be true . So he repeated , " Not at all " " I mean , if we just started from the beginning we could make this a half-decent-looking place in a year or two . What I would n't give for some decent-looking curtains on those windows . " She pointed toward the front of the house . They were lying on a blanket in the clearing in the afternoon sun , an autumnal rustle of wind in the changing leaves , the flares of yellow and red and shadings and surprises unearthly in theirp58splendor , the wood scents and smoke hints drifting by , autumnchanging the face of the world , everything in motion . " Who ever heard of a domestic actress , " he persisted . " Do you think Bernhardt was domestic ? " " She was French , " replied Charlotte with finality . " Well . . . " conceding her point , " do you suppose Katharine Hepburn is domestic ? " " I believe she 's a very good cook , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to be sort of domestic to keep a dog . " She put her small , shapely hand in his hand , which was larger than seemed likely and full of nervous strength . " But that 's all beside the point . The point is : do I have a face , a real face ? " She studied him as he lay beside her on the blanket , " or do n't I ? " He studied her in return . Impudently pretty , green-eyed , lots of dark brown hair , a small and shapely body , a little undernourished , a little over-agile , a dancer 's body ; but she had asked about her face ; he returned his attention to it : high-bridged little nose , wide-set eyes , rather wide and sensualmouth , good cheekbones ; clear , delicate jaw line . Yes , she had a face , all right . " No , you do n't have one , " he answered , " not at all . " She punched him . Seemingly immune to pain , he went on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Let me have all your creams and pencils and liners and sprays and all that . I could give you a face . " " First you want to select my clothes , now you want to do my face . What kind of a boy are you ? " " I love you too much , like a man and like a woman , " he said shortly . " I think I 'm a lesbian . " " Oh good grief . Get her . " " I 'm serious . After all , you have your masculine side . " " I do n't ! " He loved the way she said that , emphasizing the do n't ' in the British fashion ; it sounded kind of pugnacious , Rule Britannia . " Just the way you said that is as butch as hell . Besides , all the leading actresses are dykes . " " Katharine Hepburn is not a dyke . "  | " Most of the others are . Just the amount of drive it takes to I , e a success as an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means you 've got to have lots of male hormones . " She drew in her breath sharply . " Louis , I am a woman . " " Oh my God ! " He buried his face in the blanket . " Wheeew ! What movie did you get that line out of , and that reading . I ant a woman . ' Eaoughf ! " " You 're horrible . " Had he hurt her ? He had always nervously gone too far in every situation in his life . Petrified at that thought , he controlledhis face and voice and after a silence filled by the faint hissing of the leaves , he said carefully , " You have the most wonderful and the sexiest voice in America . " Husky but British , strident but tender , her voice was that to him . " Louis , are you having me on ? " " Especially when you use Limey expressions like having me on . ' But sometimes an American accent starts to creep in . Do n't let it , darrrling . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she said , her accent unobtrusively edging Mayfair-ward . " But thank the Lord you still say after ' to rhyme with crofter ' and been ' to rhyme with seen , ' so all I 'm saying is , do n't change . " " All right . " She settled against him . " And then there 's some kind of anarchy in you , the way you walk , a snap in your walk , something risky , and that 's a good sign . You might make it as an actress . " " They love me at the Yale Drama School . " " I hate Yale University . " " Do n't say that . It is n't true . " " It is true . It is n't Yale , it 's a university as such that I hate . It 's all so , I do n't know , artificial , and everybody 's hypocritical , and how you have to prepare a face to meet the faces that you meet ' and , I do n't know , conversation at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to join unless you 're , you know , a big rebel and then you 're not supposed to join them . It 's just conformity either way , as far as I can see . " " You were made for a university . You 're a brilliant student ,  |p60you  love to study , to do research , to delve into things . " " I know I do but it 's everything else I hate , and the teachers do n't seem that good , most of them . " He paused . " It is n't hard enough . " She screamed stagily . " You are dotty . " He turned his head to frown at her . " Do you really think I am ? " " Yes , " she said impudently . He took a deep breath , rather hopelessly . " Ah well , " he began , fumbling . Had he believed her ? Horrified , she waited for a half-minuteto pass and then said carefully , " You 're very original . You 're an enormously original person . Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is . " " Well you 're not . You 're just very very unusual and , " she suddenly feared she might start crying , " that 's why I  --  I 'm so fond of you . " They had met on the Old Campus at Yale during Lou 's second week there . He had run away from , been expelled from , or left by mutual agreement three private and two public schools , but his scholastic record was so full of promise that the University had nevertheless admitted him . He was assigned to a single room in Dirty Durfee , and he more or less went about acquiring his text books and attending his first classes , but in an aura of bloodless unreality . At that time he could not believe Yale and he could not believe himself : neither one truly existed . There was no color in New Haven ; there was no real air there ; his skin seemed to be drying out ; his mind endlessly repeated to him ideas it had already ground to powder . During his second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Campus , and the snap in her walk , the impudence of her face , the forthrightness of her glance promised some possibility of relief . Lou was always overcome with shyness in the presence of anyone he felt attracted to or in the presence of anyone who felt attracted to him , so he shot by her without a further glance and devoted the next week to discovering whop61she was . Charlotte Mills ; student in the Drama School ; English . He laid a trap for her as he would have in the woods for a badger or a possum , the next evening . She usually had dinner in another section of the immense Freshman Commons from his , and Lou loitered outside the door she would have to leave by , and when she came out he managed to force himself to go up alongside her and begin to speak to her in German . She stopped and stared at him , and continued to stare as he interspersed a heavily accented English word now and then . Finally he moved cautiously into full Prussian-style English and at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on her doing , and they walked away from the Freshman Commons together , and after that life for Lou at Yale was easier . He simply could not get interested in any of the extracurricularlife there ; he did not seem to be boyish enough for it , or else he was too boyish . Nor was he interested in the time-killers : bull sessions , beer sessions , football games , TV , shooting pool , movies , or blind dates . He hesitated about political activism . These were his Yale joys : Charlotte , oceanography , Greek , lacrosse . Suddenly it seemed enough , more than enough . He could not meet a girl at the discreetly sponsored " mixers " with Vassar girls and such held at Yale . He was incapable of functioning there . Instead , waylaying and charming CharlotteMills in the half-light of evening as she left the FreshmanCommons was something he knew how , liked , loved , to do . He drove her to the Black House the third evening of their acquaintance , and that is where he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , every hour he could spare from Yale , from his fascination with oceanography , Greek and lacrosse there , and she could spare from her curiouslydogged efforts to become an actress . " What 's curious about it ? " she tried to explain . " I was born upper-middle-class English . Genteel and all that . I wanted to escape from it . And , I wanted to be noticed . I still want to be noticed . " " I noticed you right off . "  | " I know , darling , but I was already embarked on this way of being noticed before I knew there was a you . Now I want both . " " You 're greedy . " " Mmmmm . " They established what Charlotte called " a private world , " and Lou called " a sexual seminar , " in the Black House , one hour from New Haven . There Lou could lift from himself the intolerable onus of being a " college student . " These were , to him , the two most repulsive words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that way . Perhaps it was the apprentice sound of them , their callowness . In the kitchen shed at the Black House he continued his chemistry experiments , and the one explosion he caused was not really serious and Charlotte was simultaneously horrified and thrilled by it . It was in that combined state that he hoped to keep her . And he resolved that she would never lay eyes on any member of his family . " I think I 'm going out of my mind , " Lou said lightly to Charlotte a few days later as they sat shelling peas on the front porch of the Black House . Lou had a theory about the inferiority of pre-shelled peas and all other prepared and processed foods , and that Charlotte went along with it , thereby condemning herself to hours of shelling and skinning and de-boning and de-feathering , was a towering proof to them both that her feeling for him was authentically love . " Going dotty , are you ? Pity . " She went on busily shelling into the pan between her sandaled feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the head of the house . " " Sometimes I feel , my , well , my hold on reality seems to be getting kind of weak . " Charlotte went on with what she was doing , more carefully , and carefully she did n't look at him . " Do you think you ought to do anything about it ? " she then said . " Do what ? " " I thought everyone in America rushed to psychoanalysts at the very first sign of a complex . "  | " Not if you 're poor . " " They have them at Yale . Free , I believe . " Lou took a deep breath . " I feel too . . . autonomous to spill everything to a psychiatrist . We 're a very autonomous family . " She stopped shelling . " Do you know that 's the very first time you ever mentioned your family . " Hurriedly he said , " There 's hardly anything to say about them . There 's really just me . Is that enough ? " Resuming her work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear up their personalities , give them insights that help wonderfully . What do you think ? " " What do you think ? " " I asked you . " After a pause he said with quiet sincerity , " I think I might go completely crazy and never come back . That 's what I really think , " and he looked very sharply at her to see her reaction . " God , " she said tentatively . " What ? " " God , " she repeated . " Have you ever thought about God ? " " God , " he exclaimed wonderingly , as though she had mentionedPeter Pumpkin . " Did n't I ever tell you that when I went into the Marine Corps there was a form asking my religion , and I wrote pagan ? " " No , " she said . " You did n't tell me that . " " I had to be truthful . My trouble with the Corps started right then , I guess . " " Yes , I would guess it would . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tag and so on . " " I see . Yes . " " No chaplain assigned to us pagans , and all . " " Mmmmm . " " But the only religious feeling I have , the only true religious feeling , is pagan . Always tell the truth . " Then he hurriedly mumbled , " Would you like to read what I wrote about it ? " and almost seemed to blush a little . Charlotte had not thought her bizarre scientist capable of blushing . " Yes , very much . "  |p64He  went into the Black House and came out carrying a black-bound notebook , and opened it to a page where there were two paragraphs written in his flowing , excitable hand-writing : I worship nature , and people , and most of all people in nature . I love trees which are going to survive , fog on the surf , birds screaming and settling by the thousands in trees overnight on their way south . I revere grass . The meaning of life is the season of spring , naturally , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Resurrection , my Resurrection , spring again . " Well , that 's just the myth of Persephone , " said Charlotte . " Exactly , " said Lou , pleased . " I wrote that when I was twelve . I did n't learn about the Persephone story until later . When I did , I began to see that I was a pagan . Read the other paragraph . " ConfiteorI believe in Physical Desire , the Power Almighty , Creator of Heaven and Earth , and in Love , its only son , Our Lord , which was conceived by man , born of man , suffered under man , was crucified by man , died and was buried . But it rises again every day and sitteth at the right hand of every man , and from thence rules the world . " When did you write that ? " asked Charlotte . " I was a little older . Not much . I believe that more than ever now . " " So do I , " she said faintly . A little later that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visit " a sick friend , an old lady . " It was only as he was driving past the Green toward his home that he realized that in that wording he had told a lie , after all : by calling his mother his friend . He stopped in front of the little white house amid all thep65shrubbery on the side street . There were barely noticeable traces of shabbiness here and there . It was very unlike his father , the Building Inspector , to let his home become the least bit shabby . Mr. Colfax , tall , portly , fifty-six , old to be the father of a nineteen-year-old , stood pulling on a pipe on the little front porch , wearing his Saturday outfit , blue dungaree pants , canvaszipper jacket , red hunting cap . " That motor makes a lot of noise outside the house of a sick woman , " he said loudly as soon as Lou had cut off the engine . " Next time park around the corner . Come on foot . " Lou nodded without speaking , came up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today ? " After a stiff little silence Mr. Colfax answered , " Not at all well , " with a strange resentment . Lou suddenly realized that she was dying . " Do n't say anything about anything that 's going to upset her . I do n't give a damn what this week 's problem is . Understand ? " Lou said he understood , went in , up to his mother 's shadowedbedroom . She was frailer and more tentative than ever , crushed first by her father and then her husband and now cancer . They talked very quietly of inconsequentials . The moi tal illness had returned to her face the ghost of her girlish look , which Lou had never seen . She must have been awfully pretty once , he reflected , awfully pretty once . She wanted to talk . It was one of the very few conversations that approached intimacy he ever had with her . " You were such a good baby , the best baby that ever was . You never fussed . You always seemed to be contented and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baby that ever was . " In a little while he left the room and he never saw her alive again . " You 've made too many mistakes , " his father said , on the porch . " If you get kicked out of Yale , join the Marines . Are you mixed up with a girl ? " he demanded , in a Colfax flash of intuition . " No , " said Lou stonily.  | " You started all that much too early . That 's one thing that 's wrong with you . All that 's wasting time . If you are , and I think you are , do n't bring her around here and upset your mother . You 've made too many mistakes . " After Lou left to visit this sick friend , Charlotte finished shelling the peas , then changed into black tights to do her dance practice . She no longer had ambitions to be a ballerina but she felt herself just old-fashioned enough , just British enough , to believe that an actress had to have a trained body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her fellow studentstalked about " spontaneity " and said , " I do n't feel it " about some line of dialogue , she was quietly disgusted . You do n't always feel it , she muttered to herself , bat you just learn to get the hell up and do it anyway . She was doing some squats , as graceless but as strengtheningas could be , when a voice yelled , " Hi there ! Hi there ! " from the lawn , the front door flew open and a large older woman , very incongruously dressed in a bright yellow dress , sailed in , exclaiming cheerily , " Where 's Louie ? Hi there ! I 'm Lydia Colfax . Who 're you ? My , that looks strenuous . Goodness . Who 're you ? " " I 'm Charlotte , " she almost rudely let it go at that , thought better of it , after all the woman looked pleasant enough , and so she added , " Mills , a friend of  --  Lou 's . You 're a relation . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Did they ! " said Charlotte intently , moving toward the oval table in the middle of the room and indicating a chair for Lydia , who , however , had already slid into it . Lou had been opaque on the subject of his family . To her questions had come the answer : " They 're out of it . There 's just me . Is that enough ? " " I 'm on TV , that 's why I never have any time to visit . Have you been up here before ? No , of course not , no woman would let this place stay such a mess . " " I 've been here many times . Lou and I use it for work and for our  --  "  | " is that so ? Do you ? My , you 're pretty , are n't you . Maybe I eoold use you on my program .... " Charlotte 's feelings were thrown into confusion ; all of them had been flowing strongly away from this erratic woman , and now suddenly she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dancer , " she began uncertainly . " I just do that for training . I 'm an actress . " " Well , we do n't use actresses , " said Lydia , heartily , instantly resolving Charlotte 's conflict . " I never appear on TV , " said Charlotte coolly , which God knew was true . She was thinking about ways to get rid of the woman so she could go on with her exercises , when she remembered the reference to the Colfax family . And after all , she herself was the first relative Charlotte had ever seen . " I was just stopping to make some coffee , " she said . " I hope you do n't mind ' instant . ' You said the Colfax family came from England . " " Yeeesss , " said Lydia , eyes sparkling . " I 'll say we did . Good riddance to bad rubbish ' they must have said in Merrie Englandwhen we left . But Louie must have told you about us , did n't he ? How peculiar . Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same thing . I 'll tell you that much myst ; lf . Poor Cousin Bill and all . Just black , dear , and no sugar . What funny cups . Alice had strange taste in everything ... chinaware . . . nephews . . . . " " Miss Colfax  --  " " Lydia , dear , Lydia , state-wide I 'm Lydia , and in western Massachusetts and upper-state New York too , I 'm Lydia to everybody . " " Well  --  urn  --  Lydia , you see , Lou and I have so much to talk about , studies and research and things , that we actually have n't talked about his relations at all . Who was Alice ? " Lydia 's slightly protruding blue eyes roamed brightly over her for a moment and then planting her hands on the table she heaved around and stared at the black wall behind her . " See that ? That 's who Alice is . " " See what  --  a wall  --  ? " She took Charlotte over to the wall and with her fingerp68traced Alice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light was right beneath the black paint Lou had put over it . " Of course , " murmured Charlotte , " he did say an aunt had left him the house . " " And he never showed you this will ? The talk of Wetherford ? Peculiar . " " On the wall . She must have been crazy , " Charlotte mused . Lydia 's big , sparkling eyes enjoyed the expression on Charlotte'sface . " Some people thought she was . " " Well , " amended Charlotte , already defensive about the Colfaxes , even to one of their number , " I think it 's grand that way , tell the world , emblazon it on a hoarding  --  billboard , if it 's important enough , scribble it all over the wall ! She must have been a marvelous woman . " Lydia chuckled to herself , then looked with wayward amusement at Charlotte , her eyes reflecting some tricky interiorsatisfaction . " You do , do you ? " Raising her chin , she looked back . " Yes . " " How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a silence , Charlotte answered , " We have a very seriousrelationship . " " Oh dear , the words you young people use these days . I do n't know if a very serious relationship ' means you 're writing a book together or whether he 's got you pregnant , " and the eyes worked over her . The chin stayed raised . " He has not got me pregnant , ' because something else about us young people is that girls do n't get pregnant ' any more unless they want to . But , " the chin coming down a quarter of an inch , " we just might find we wanted to have a child . It 's possible . " " You mean get married and  --  " " Oh , we might want that paper from the Registry Office or whatever it is . We might not . As pagans we  --  " " As what ? " " As pagans we do n't really need that . More coffee ? " " I 'll say . I might even have a shot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Pagans ! " she echoed under her breath . " What next ? "  | " Lou 's father and mother , when did they die ? He seems so sad about them , you know , being alone in the world . " Now Lydia really raked her with those bulging blue eyes , bright as Christmas-tree balls . " Well , I do n't know what he said or did n't say , but the grandfather and grandmother of that pagan baby you 're going to have were living about a mile and a half from here last time I heard , which was about suppertime yesterday . " Charlotte was an actress . Her face handled this information by complex adjustments which emerged finally as an expression of pleased serenity . " A shot of what ? " she asked pleasantly . " Huh ? " " We have n't anything except some whisky . Will that be all right ? " Less brightly , more analytically , Lydia 's eyes studied her . " Yes , some whisky would do fine . What kind of whisky ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 'll do fine . Where is Louie , anyway ? " " He  --  " she hesitated , then went calmly on , " went to visit a sick friend , he said . " " That would be his mother . " Charlotte smiled carefully . " Does n't tell you much , does he ? " Lydia blurted . Charlotte poured the whisky into a shot glass , filled it to the brim , spilling nothing , and placed it before Lydia . Then she said , " Louis is the most valuable person I ever met . That makes him different from others . I knows he tells me everything that  --  " it had all gone so well , so far , " everything that I need , that is between us . Who was poor Cousin Bill ' ? " " Who ? " The sparkle gone from her eyes , Lydia stared , and then said , " My , you do listen , do n't you ? " " I try to . " Slightly daunted in spite of all the humiliations she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chair and said , ' Well , Cousin Bill is forty-two or more years old . Do you know how people tell you who he is , how they identify him ? They say , Bill Colfax , you know , the basketball player ! '  |p70Forty-two  or more years old if he 's a day . The basketball player . I think he still gets into a few games at the Y ' in Hartford on Saturday afternoons once in a while . That 's who Cousin Bill is . " " Forty-two . Or more . Yes , I do see . " " Karen , we 've got a  --  " " Charlotte . " " Yes . I was going to say we 've got a lot of pretty strange people in this family you want to marry into  --  ah , I mean , this family you 're going to have a pagan baby with . " " Tell me more about them . " " Oh , I 've got to get back home . Now that you 're here I want to get those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cats ? " " Oh yes . " Lydia studied her through narrowed eyes , then said , " Anyway , you 'll meet the whole damn family at the funeral , if you and Louie are still planning pagan babies then and if he does n't keep that a secret too , his mother dying . Well , just for a preview of coming attractions , there 's Marguerite , our great lady  --  dipsomaniac , manic-depressive , spinster . She calls her drinking bouts migraine headaches . ' Everybody knows why her head is aching . Then we 've got the great Philip Colfax Clinger . You 've heard of Philip Colfax Clinger , he 's our celebrity , or he was our celebrity , until I took to the airwaves . You never heard of Philip Colfax Clinger ? " " I 'm afraid people in the theater never read about anything except show business . " " Politician . National politician , did n't quite make it nationally , then he did n't quite make it state-wide , then he sort of lost it locally . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Colfax in him . He ran for President last time  --  President of the United States  --  the Anti-Fluoridation candidate . You know , against that chemical they 're putting in the water to keep people from getting cavities in their teeth . It 's poison , deadly , according to Cousin Philip , rots the brain , a political trick to keep the populace down . What I think he really thinksp71is that he got beaten in all those elections because they put fluoride in his water . So that 's the great Philip Colfax Clinger . Well , " and here her voice dropped to a new abysmal tone , " and then there 's George . " Charlotte suppressed a flinch . " Miss  --  I  --  Lydia , maybe you 'd just as well not tell me about George today . " Lydia cocked an eye at her . " Kind of getting to you , is n't it ? Now you see why Louie did n't tell you . " Lydia helped herself to one more nip of Scotch and got up . " Fill it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back the bottle . " Louie 'll never notice . He 's in a world of his own , like the whole family . Am I right ? " " Oh , why , I do n't know , I do n't think so , no . " Lydia flashed a last , broad , conspiratorial smile and then , to Charlotte 's concealed horror , suddenly dropped a little-girl curtsey in the doorway , and left . Charlotte returned to the oval table and sat carefully down . Dance exercises were out of the question . She eyed the whisky . She had never cared for whisky . Then she remembered the Benzedrine in her purse and took one . Perhaps it was all a lie , Lydia a deranged neighbor no relation at all to Lou , and all the others , Bill and Marguerite and above all , George , figments . Perhaps Lou really had no family at all , as he had implied to her . But if he had , if it was all true , if Lydia was a close relative , that was that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself was what mattered . He came back about noon : tall , fair-skinned , dark brown hair , all in black , walking in with brisk grace , nervous , big smile , jittery , intelligent , incorrigible , basically desperate  --  Louis . " Sit down , you look upset , " she said quietly . " Are you drunk ! " he demanded in his resonant voice , halflaughing , half-disbelieving . " Sitting alone in a room with a half-empty bottle of Scotch ! In the morning ! What is this ? " " I 've not touched a drop . You know that 's not my bit . " She paused for several beats . " It was Cousin Lydia ' who did the drinking . " Hesitating on his way into the chair opposite her , a half/guilty , half-suppressed , found-out smile broke over his face , and then he sat down , gave her a look full of discernment and said casually , " Oh . " " Yes . Cousin Lydia called . " " Did she ? " " How is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Pretty sick . Very sick . Well , " he spread his hands and gazed at her unhappily , " she 's dying . " " Lou , why did n't you tell me about your family , especially when they 're in this very town . Am I such a flibbertigibbet I ca n't be trusted at all ? " " Flibbertigibbet . That 's a wonderful word . I think you are a flibbertigibbet . " " Be serious . I do n't think you 've ever taken me seriously for a second . " " Boy , are you wrong . Boy . " " Well then , why on earth did n't you tell me ? Were you going to keep your own mother 's death a secret from me ? " He sighed , sat back , flung a scrap of paper he had been kneading with his fingers on the table . " I was afraid you would be afraid if you knew . Afraid of us . Afraid of me " He looked suddenly up at her . " Well , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I thought you understood . I 'm in love with you . I thought you understood what that was like . If you told me your father was the Mad Hatter and your mother was Lady Macbeth , I 'd  --  I think I 'd love you more , because I 'd feel you needed me even more than I 'd realized . " He looked into her eyes , then down to the table , then back at her again . Finally he said a little unsteadily , " Do you mean it ? " He looked like a very young boy , utterly sincere , discoveringtrust at last , not having dared believe in its existence before . For a moment Charlotte felt ancient . The drug was working on her perceptions . She saw him . She could hardly bear to see what she saw . He was sitting across the oval table from her in thep73straight-backed chair and now , to occupy his hands while his feelings digested what had been said , he thoughtlessly spread out the paper he had been handling . There was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cross-section of something . Then as he hesitated , reflecting , he looked up and gazed not at her but straight through her , seeking his mind 's vision . He was much more handsome than was good for him . She suddenly saw that ; she wondered if he knew it . He knew so much and so little . His rather wide-set dark brown eyes , full eyebrows , long lashes , rather high forehead concealed beneathfalling , dark brown shiny hair ; straight , well-formed nose , wide , sensual mouth , face structure modeled for sculpture . And straight white teeth , and well-shaped close to the head ears . And it was the teeth and the ears that obscurely fascinated and even annoyed Charlotte . Why had nature bothered to go that far ! Could n't she at least have made him a little jugeared , slightly buck-toothed ! No . Even the teeth , even the ears . Pulled over this ideal formation was tissue-paper skin , vulnerableto everything . And there was a sense , at the corners of the eyes , at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these odd corners as frail , undeveloped , as an infant , tiny last dots of frail infancy . All his life Lou was going to have this streak of newly born in him , startled , pristine , astonished , threatened . Charlotte stared fixedly and longed to protect him forever , as a mother would , be a tigress for him , cover him with an impenetrable love . " If there 's something the matter with my face , " he said in his  --  that too  --  beautiful man 's voice , " stop staring and tell me . I know I have n't slept too well lately . " " Your face is all right , " she said faintly . Mrs. Colfax died the following week . She left a will bequeathingher few rings and family mementoes to this and that relative , and to Lou she left her Bible and all her other books , and five hundred dollars . It was all the money she had top74leave , and Lou realized that she must have set it carefully aside over a period of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of material value . It must have meant a distinct sacrifice for her to accumulate this sum , and he was inexpressiblytouched . It was so typical of her to conceal her feelings for him behind money , and to give it from the grave . The Colfax family had been rich in the nineteenth century by interior New England standards ; they had had a textile mill and an interest in railroading , and then there had been large houses and grand tours of Europe , and they even kept show-horses . But textiles and railroading both eventually withered in New England , but the Colfaxes had anticipated their decline by an inner family fatigue , through two generationsof squandering uncles and bad-investment aunts and improvident cousins , so that in Wetherford for the last twenty-five years the word had been that they " had n't a bean " anymore , any of them . This was not quite true . Money of that bulk flowing through the family left deposits stuck here and there , a small residue of blue-chip stocks , a little cache of government bonds , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At important family events this money would come unstuck and to the rescue . It was sending Lou to Yale , it had helped him buy the Morgan . With monumental reluctance , Lou agreed at last to let Charlotte attend the funeral with him . " God knows what you 'll make of them all , " he muttered . " Think about your mother , not me . " " I am . " He looked fixedly at her . " You are my mother . " She started . She wished she had taken a pill . They were standing in the little downstairs hall of his parents ' house , with its lemon-colored floor , a floor which had always depressed him so much , shiny , and inexpensive and pathetic . Here his father , Louis the Terrible , had stamped out his rages , in this little lemon-colored floor , instead of in the great granite corridors of the Kremlin . Down the little staircase , too big for it , his father came , wearing a gray suit , black tie , and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pallbearers , followed with the casket con/taining his mother . Lou could not imagine why it had to be so big and heavy for a small woman , nor how it could ever be manipulated down the cramped staircase . Charlotte , in a dark blue suit and hat , was introduced by Lou in a mutter to his father as he paused in front of them . Mr. Colfax did n't seem to hear . Somehow the casket was maneuvered to the ground floor and they all followed it to the hearse . Lou and Charlotte got into the hired limousine behind it with his father , and with Aunt Marguerite , who had waited for them in the car . " She always wanted to go unnoticed , " said Marguerite at once , clutching Mr. Colfax 's hand , " always self-effacing , sweet . And now , leading the procession in that great  --  tank ahead of us , " she sighed a little sigh . Mr. Colfax 's clouded scowl did not clear . Lou and Charlotte sat upright on the edges of the jump seats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lou turned and murmured , " Aunt Marguerite , this is Charlotte Mills . " Marguerite 's weary blue eyes settled charitably upon her . " My dear , " she murmured vaguely . Charlotte returned a pinched smile . As the procession moved through the autumnal streets of Wetherford , beneath the arching , ruby-red or russet or mudcoloredleaves , Marguerite , whose odor of medicine and face powder was stronger than the musty odor of the limousine , began to cry silently . Now and then she would look up piteously at the two rigid figures in front of her . Finally she leaned forward , touched Lou on the shoulder , and said , " Do you carry a handkerchief ? " Lou fumbled nervously about his clothes and then answered , " No . " Charlotte felt compelled to search her purse and offer her handkerchief to Marguerite . " I was so  --  disconcerted this morning I forgot , forgot to bring a handkerchief , imagine , forgot to bring a handkerchief to a funeral , think of it , forgot to bring a handkerchief to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forgot to bring a handkerchief to the funeral of a loved relative , honestly , forgot to bring a handkerchief  --  "  | " Aunt Marguerite , " said Lou quietly , " is there going to be a wake ? " Something steely happened to her face , some flexing of urges and resistances , and then the face , patrician , still vaguely beautiful , composed itself and she said quietly , " I believe so , yes . It 's wise psychologically , is n't it ? It 's wise . " " Where ? " " At your house . " Charlotte just audibly gasped . Then Lou said , " I hope there 's enough liquor at  --  Dad 's house . " Marguerite 's face became even more composed . " I believe there is , " she said calmly . " Yes , I believe so . " By the time they reached the church Charlotte had in spite of herself become favorably impressed with Aunt Marguerite who , despite some little peculiarities , seemed composed , a lady , with a version of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possessing a certain wisdom . Inside , the church was white-walled , spacious , with largepanedwindows of clear glass , and only a ponderous pulpit to break the almost stark simplicity of the room . A large group of mourners , Charlotte presumed most of them Colfaxes , were seated toward the middle of the church . As she slowly followedLou 's mother 's body up the aisle , she felt , from what she could glimpse of them , that they looked a very appropriatelydressed , dignified , and handsome group . If herself , a stranger trailing in as one of the chief mourners directly behind the casket , did n't shake their composure at all , she presumed it ran rather deep . Lou had refused to attend the funeral unless she sat beside him . Mr. Colfax had emerged from his reverie long enough to insist that Lou sit with him , and so Charlotte found herself with father and son in the front row . The service was as simple as the church . But then came the eulogy , delivered by the Reverend Colfax Carter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rose into the pulpit and contemplated them below.  |p77Charlotte  contemplated him . Something wide-set about the eyes behind the enlarging lenses of his glasses , a certain distinction to the forehead , derived from what she was corningto think of as the Colfax Face . The rest was going to jowls and mottled cheeks and uncertain mouth , sparse hair and corpulence . His voice as he began had a curious tinny resonance . It startled , almost alarmed her . Why ? She glanced at Lou . His clear profile was turned intently upward , calmly . What she heard when the minister spoke was unnervingly like Lou 's voice , but tinny , gut-less , as though spoken by Lou down an old , rusted drain pipe . The Reverend Henriques spoke in sudden , rushed bunches of words interspersed with pregnant silences . His eyes darted sharply , suspiciously here and there . He moved about , his hands came up , down , his arms were flung wide , and then he would stand stock still , staring down at them . He was trying , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We 're going to miss her and miss her a lot . " Long pause , then in a rush , " Women like that seem to be disappearing from our midst . . . from our midst . . . . We look around us and what do we find but the whole general breakdown of moral tone not to mention law and order " " Old people have been saying that for five thousand years at least , " Lou whispered evenly to Charlotte . As chief mournerstheir pew was a little separate from the others , and with Mr. Colfax in his trance , she presumed no one else could hear him . " Constance Colfax stood for forbearance  --  she did her duty , played her responsible part never protesting her lot .... " " Never did , God help her . " " She prayed ! She worked ! She was perhaps what Jesus calls long-suffering and for such is the Kingdom of Heaven .... " " And hell on earth . " " Louis  --  " ... and let me just say this to you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glaring menacingly at them , the ReverendHenriques took his longest pause of all ; from a profes/sional standpoint , Charlotte had to admire his theatrical daring . He remained so silent so long she began to think it was not theatrical daring but a speech impediment , when suddenly he burst out , " Some of these new Divinity School products well God forgive them for their doubts and lies compromising Christian truths until nothing is left anymore " Questioning basic Christian truths , " an interminable silence ; at long last , " they dare to question basic Christian truths from the housetops and still call themselves ministers of the gospel they are blaspheming dragging their doubts into the open instead of living with them in silence .... " " Like you . " " Be quiet . " ... wrecking the house of God through their intellectual pride this generation in and out ofthe church is bent on destroying the past " " Yes . " " Unwilling to accept anything on faith and so doomed to be left with nothing except their doubts and their puerile intellectualpride corrupters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be going to last forever . Lou 's nervousinterruptions , his way of holding the shock of his mother'sdeath at bay and , like so many of his desperate devices , vulnerable to the worst misinterpretations , subsided under the bombast and silences of the Reverend Henriques ' harangue . Now Charlotte realized why he had insisted she sit beside him ; without her physical presence here , he might not have been able to control himself . His was the kind of temperament that irresistibly feels it is going to laugh hysterically at funerals , jump off the tops of buildings , fall into furnaces , drop babies . He could not help himself . But she could help him . " Whew , " he breathed , when the Reverend Henriques at long last descended from the pulpit . On the other side of Mr. Colfax , forgotten by Charlotte , Marguerite grimly pulled on her gloves.  | " Wakes are n't a Congregational tradition , " Lou said to Charlotte , " but they 're a Colfax tradition . Any excuse for a drink . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good psychologically . " " Do you ? " Golf axes swirled around them in the cramped kitchen , reaching , talking , laughing , jostling . Ice trays and bottles and glasses and plates of crackers and celery passed from hand to hand . It was all extremely hurried , just as the funeral , except for the eulogy , had been . Dispose of her ! Out of the way , into the ground , out of sight , out of mind . Get a drink ! Onward , onward . Lingering over somebody 's death is old-fashioned , Victorian , Puritanical , as out-of-date as poor Colfax Carter Henriques and his quaint sermons . Attacking divinity schools ! Get the ice trays , open the bottles , get some bourbon , Scotch , gin into your system , mix it with what 's left of last night 's sleeping pill , this morning'swake-up pill , and the special tranquilizer reserved for occasions like funerals , and proceed to get good and drunk . Charlotte watched the rapid disintegration of the composureshe had thought she 'd seen in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They were , with a couple of horrendous exceptions , good-looking people and they did dress well , at least for this occasion . But they could not hold a line , could not contain themselves , could not complete a style of behavior , did not , finally , give a damn , it seemed to her , being nudged and edged this way and that by them in the kitchen . Philip Colfax Clinger , as tall , broad-shouldered , florid-faced , silver-haired , and fatuous as a politician could be , shook her hand , a total stranger , with the heartiest cordiality , asked her when she was coming to see him , and shoved on . A cadaverousfigure loping back and forth on the back porch she conjectured to be Bill the basketball player . A deadly pale man looking absolutely petrified in a corner she thought might be George . She looked quickly away from him , and concentrated on not looking in his direction again . It took all of her willpower.  |p80Lou  's father stumped into the kitchen , the clouded scowl still sitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straight Scotch from his glass . Mr. Colfax was ordinarily one of the rare , abstemious Colfaxes . He stared into the busy space of the kitchen for a while , and then his face cleared , his eyes brightened and he suddenly saw Charlotte . " So you 're this boy 's girl friend , are you ? " he demanded with a strange grin . She had seen people in a state of profoundemotional shock before , and knew that the depth of their sorrow sometimes took the form of a kind of glassy gaiety . Mr. Colfax was passing into this state ; she was touched to see it ; tyrant or not , he had loved his wife . " I  --  suppose  --  " Charlotte 's voice suddenly failed ; she smiled desperately . " You 're next ! " His strange smile and the light in his eyes were leveled at her . " You 're next . Did you hear Henriques ' sermon ? " " Yes , " she managed . " You 're next , all of you . Tearing down everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kids will you have , you people who 're tearing down everything , I wonder . " He included in this observation his son , who had been memorizing the name plate on the refrigerator . " Oh , we 're just friends , " she attempted . " I wo n't support you , " Mr. Colfax continued heartily . " This big kid here is on his own . About time . Twenty-two years old  --  " " Nineteen , " Charlotte was amazed to hear herself contradict . " Go ahead and multiply but do n't look at me ! " When he smiled so widely he suddenly acquired the Colfax handsomeness . " Do n't look at me ! Give ' em an education , I say . That 's it . You 're a pretty sort of girl . I told him not to get involved with girls  --  " " But after all , Dad , " Lou said . " I am twenty-two . " A shrewd glance passed from father to son . " Maybe you 'll make a go of it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did ! "  | " The hell you did , " Lou murmured , but Charlotte felt , seeing this stunned false cheerfulness , that in some way or other they must have . " We did , so who knows ! " " Where 's Louis ! " Aunt Marguerite rasped , lurching into their group . " Where 's Louis ! " Her hair was beginning to come a little unfixed , and her hand gripped her tumbler of vodka like a claw . She stood in front of him , and with her free hand , she slapped him very hard across the face . A red glow slowly emerged on his tissue-paper skin but he did n't move . " Mock your mother at her funeral ! " she yelled . " Make jokes to that little tart in God 's house with your dead mother lying ten feet away ! " She started to hit him again . Lou seized her wrist and pinned it to her side . " You unnatural little freak ! I 'll teach you  --  " Several relatives were pulling her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saint ! Making jokes with that little tart ! " They got her to the back door and across the porch and into the back yard . Shaking , afraid she was going to be actively sick , Charlotte noticed that neither Lou , Mr. Colfax , nor anyone else there was as shocked as she was or as anyone ordinarily would be . Scenes like this had happened in the family before , often . Back at last at the Black House , she took off her hat and gloves and put them on the oval table . It took her some little time to get the gloves off because her hands were shaking so . Lou noticed this , of course ; Lou noticed everything . " I tried to keep you from meeting them . " " It does n't matter . I 'm glad I did . " Lou took off his jacket and black tie . Carefully he asked , " What are you thinking about ? " After a pause she answered , " Nothing . " " What are you thinking about ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family , Louis . I told you that . "  | " Yeah , but then you had n't seen them in action . You 'd never seen Aunt Marguerite 's right cross . " " People who ca n't hold their whisky are no news to me . " " Does it worry you about the future ? About me ? " " I would n't care  --  " " If my mother was Lady Macbeth and Dad was the Mad Hatter . Well , they are n't . Mother was Ophelia and Dad is Ivan the Terrible . So , does n't that really bother you ? " " Of course not . " " Jesus , what a lousy liar . You 'll never make it as an actress , darling . " " Do n't get nasty just because you 're unhappy . " Lou sighed and slumped down on the automobile seat against the wall . " Would n't you be unhappy ? " She sat down on the car seat against the opposite wall and stared at him and at the faint trace of Aunt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Forget them . That 's the past . Think about me . I 'm the future , are n't I ? " Lou 's face was working and she saw that she had said , profoundly , the right thing . That gave her a totally unexpectedaccess of courage . Therefore she suddenly said , " I want to tell you something . " He fired his super-alert look across at her . " I 'm not twenty . I lied . I 'm twenty-four . " " You 're not  --  I mean . I do n't  --  " " I lied telling you I was twenty because I  --  thought the gap might seem too much for you . I 'm an old woman , six years away from thirty ! " " Old woman , " he repeated with humorous mockery . " I 'm an aged female , and my , well , how shall I say , reproductiveperiod is at its height and wo n't last all that much longer . If I had a child now , well , if I  --  we conceived a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and forty when it was fifteen . I do n't believe in parents being much older than that with teen-age children , do you ? " Recollecting that his own father had been fifty-three when he was sixteen , he emphatically agreed . But what he said was , " I 'll only be thirty-four . "  | " You are a beast . " " What 's your point , anyway ? I do n't see your point , " he lied , detesting it . " I do n't care if you 're forty now . " " I want to get cracking , darling . " " Get cracking ! " he said with a chuckle . " Get cracking ! A child , that 's what I mean . I could n't care less about a ring . I could n't care less about what your father said about not supporting you , us . I think it was that that really crystallized this in my head , this idea of a child , now . There really is nothing like a threat to bring out an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could never leave England and set up in America that made me do it . You know ? " Lou did know . It was the implicit threat of inescapable strangeness and failure in his family tree that accounted for his every effort to surmount them . " Also , " she went on , " I 've been doing some checking . Bernhardtdid have a child . Illegitimate , of course . Actually , you love children . " " I know I do , " he murmured . " A child , " she repeated . " I ca n't stand barren women , in the theater or out of it . They 're so dry , like those leaves out there in front of the house , skittering this way and that , cackling . I ca n't bear that , not for myself . " Desperately , Lou said , " I do n't think Katharine Hepburn has any children . " Charlotte paused and then answered slowly , " I do n't think I 'm going to have a career like Katharine Hepburn 's  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good , not really anything like that good . Acting will never take up that much space in my life . I wo n't last that long . I 'll need something more . I 'll need a child , maybe just one , but  --  a child , " she stopped . " Will you give it to me ? " She looked across the room at him . " Of course I  --  naturally  --  " " That 's the word . Naturally . " " I 'm so goddamned messed up . Such a Colfax ! " " You are n't . You 're very balanced in many ways . Or else you would n't be spending your life entirely with me and yourp84studies . You 'd be , I do n't know , playing basketball  --  " " There 's my lacrosse . " " That 's just aesthetics with you , a sort of nature walk , that 's why you go to the lacrosse field . " He was silent , pleased to be understood . " You 'd be going to those horrid mixers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You are pursuing your goals , and I want to pursue my goals too . I do n't want my dreams to go up in smoke , to fade away . I 'd love to have a really good part in a good Broadway play  --  or Off-Broadway play . I do n't care , maybe just once . And a child . Maybe just once . " " All right , " he said quietly . A chord deeper than any she thought possible then struck in her . It was at once the most erotic and most idealistic seizure she had ever experienced , and beyond anything she had imaginedpossible , in herself or anyone else . They wandered into the kitchen shed for glasses and drank some Scotch . It had an unexpectedly powerful effect on her . He took her shaking hand ; trembling , she got out of her clothes ; light-headed , she got into Aunt Alice 's bed , and as he made love to her , for the twentieth or fortieth time , she felt this act between them as wondrously new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motion , that all its profound movements and their meanings and clamoring excitementsmight be clear , its stages so fully expressed that they could be carved in stone for  --  yes , for future generations . She fell asleep . She had not slept like that before , at least not since earliest childhood . She slept as though wrapped in soft gauze , layer on layer , her body and her mind too , cushioned , overlaid , rested as she had forgotten the possibility of such rest , floated deep , and when she woke in the morning it was as though she had returned renewed from some long and marvelousjourney , and that she and Wetherford and the Black House and Lou were all fresh and vivid as they had never been before , heightened in all their qualities . Lou was not beside her in the bed . Soon she heard the Morgan drive up , and he came into the main room , which was alight with sun shining into it through the festive autumnalp85leaves ; magical , all of it , and she was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Lou had never looked quite this handsome before . He moved about the room , setting the oval table for breakfast . Charlotte stopped in the doorway from the bedroom , wearingAlice 's long blue robe , shiny brown hair around her face and shoulders , and realized that he had never set the table before . He did not do things like that . Some faintest ripple of apprehension stirred in her , and the cocoon of enchantment in which she had spent one third of one twenty-four hour cycle in all the years of her life on earth began to unravel . " I 'll do that , " she said . " It 's okay . Sit here . What kind of eggs do you want ? " " Any kind . " Then she broke free into deepest happiness again . He was acting like the very stereotype of a husband with a newly pregnant wife on his hands . It was so touching , and so funny , that she felt like crying . Instead , her Englishnessasserted itself this morning , and she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He glanced at her and then went into the kitchen to boil some water on the gas ring . " How did you sleep ? " he called to her . " Like a  --  baby , " she heard herself reply . Silence from the kitchen ; then she said , " I did n't even hear you get up and go out . " More silence from the kitchen , so she then pursued casually , " Where did you go ? " " To put flowers on mother 's grave . " She drew a long breath , moved by that , wondering why she had n't thought of it herself . And then , for some reason , she suddenly did not believe him . The cocoon unraveled a little more . " Are you feeling all right ? " he asked . The solicitous husband again , she thought , and her joy returned . " Never better .

I 've never felt like this ever before in my life and never will again I 'm sure , perfectly sure , so just do n't laugh at me and see if I 'm not right in a month or so because I just mean that there 's got to be some special explanation for the perfectly , well , extraordinary way I happen to feel this morning and the way I slept , floated , last night . There has to be . " " Very well , " he said quietly . " What ? " Silence . Very well ? ' Charlotte was baffled by these two simple words he had used because they were so completely out of character , totally absent from his usual vocabulary ; they sounded formal , clerkish , prim almost . Very well ? ' It sounded like an impersonation . And yet it was impossible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And the unraveling progressed . Lou came out of the kitchen and set the eggs , with toast and coffee , before her . The texture of the eggs , the degree of brownness of the toast , the amount of marmalade on the plate beside it , even the height to which the coffee had been poured in the cup , displayed Lou 's scientist 's concern with precision , order , exact calculation . His own appearance and his rooms did not show this ; these were the Given , and so they were casual , sometimes messy ; but what he did , what he acted upon , created , from boiled eggs to bombs to the charting of the seas , had to be done with this meditative , devoted care and exactitude . Charlotte began slowly to eat the breakfast ; opposite her , he wolfed his . " How weird , " she could n't help saying in a wondering voice , " to have creation inside of you . Do n't laugh ! Please , please , do n't . Let me sound as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning . " She leaned toward him , her long hair falling forward . " I 've never had a morning like this and , " the happinessfading a little from her voice , " I think probably I never will have again . I 'm a Once ' person , I think . One good role ,  |p87one  good baby . " She looked a shade tearily at him . " One good morning like this , in my life . " " Charlotte  --  " " So just let me be a slob and cry or whatever . It 's not a scene you 're going to see me play again . " " Charlotte  --  " " I know I have this briskness , British briskness , British brittleness about me most of the time . I know you happen to like that , my snap you call it . Well . . . Louis , it 's a pose , a defense , ' my wall protecting my shyness  --  all English people are hopelessly shy , you know  --  and , no I 'm not going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so uncomfortable  --  but this one morning of my life , let me be a slob , Sentimental Sarah , because a mother is n't brisk and brittle , or should n't be , should n't be shy either for that matter , should be full of emotions and feelings and sentiments , and even  --  tears . " " Charlotte , listen , I  --  " " Probably I am talking a lot of nonsense . Probably I 'm not pregnant at all . What do you think ? " " Charlotte  --  " his face was contorted with a pleading look , unhandsome for the first time in her experience , almost unrecognizable . Suddenly she remembered the utterly changed face of Marguerite between the ride to the church and the wake afterward . She felt along her upper right arm with her left hand , as though some message in Braille were written there to reassure her . But there was no reassurance . " Charlotte , you 're not pregnant , you ca n't be because  --  I , we had those drinks last night , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you got all upset by my family , funerals , that witch , it seemed better so I put  --  my  --  uh  --  the rubber  --  " Charlotte stared at him for several seconds , and then as the meaning of his words reached her and the tormented expression on his face convinced her that what he said was true , she let her eyes fall to the last of the egg on her plate , pulled the paper napkin out of her lap , crushed it , put it on the plate , got up , murmured , " Excuse me " as she had been taught to do as a little girl when leaving the table , and made her way across toward the bedroom door . " Excuse me , " she murmured again ,  |p88more  or less to herself . Lou got up swiftly and moved across toward her , but Charlotte reached the bedroom , slammed shut the door and threw Aunt Alice 's powerful , paranoid lock . Nothing short of an ax could penetrate Aunt Alice 's bedroom when locked . Lou tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began to putter uselessly around the outside room . Two hours later Charlotte came out . She had on the samerobe ; her hair hung down as before . She was exactly the same , except that to Lou she looked violently different , as though she had been brutalized . He wanted to kill himself . " More coffee ? " he asked . " Please . " " Getting a little sunnier . Cream ? I know sometimes you like it black or  --  " " Mmm . Cream . One sugar . Nice day to travel . " " It sure is . Travel ? " " I mean for driving to New Haven . My class . " " Yes . Your class ? " " Improvisations . " " That 's tonight ? " " Mmm . I may stay over . I think I probably will . Those improvisations can be interminable . " " When do we leave ? " She stirred her coffee . " Well if you do n't need the car I 'll just take it as I 've done before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your father with the after-funeral things , there must be loads to do . " " I do n't need the car , no . " " But you do , you do , " she said decisively . " I 'll simply take the train from Hartford to New Haven . " " You 'll take the car . " " I 'll take the train from Hartford to New Haven , " she said quietly . Ili , Lou crossed to look out the window . " Very well , " he said . " I 'll call you in your room in New Haven at midnight . " " There 's no phone here , do n't  --  " " I 'll call you from the booth on the highway , okay ? "  | " Why go out ? " " I 'll call you , okay ? " " Okay , " she said casually . " Charlotte , listen , " he began . " No need to say anything , " she said , " I understand . " " Maybe you do and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I understand . No need . " He sighed . " Do you love me ? " he asked , trying for a cheerfultone . " Love , " she said . " Love is what people do , not what they say , is n't it ? It 's what I do that shows that , not what I say . You have to answer your own question . So , do I love you ? " After a silence , he said , " Yes . " Charlotte took the six o'clock train to New Haven that night . She was not in her room there when he called at midnight , not in when he called at one o'clock , not in at two . He was afraid to call at three , although he was still in the outdoor telephone booth on the highway , as he was at four , five , and six . After clearing Aunt Lydia out of the house , after persuadingher to keep the cats a while longer , for he could not always be at the Black House and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Lou went to see his father . Mr. Colfax had had the most famous temper in the entire family . His was the temperament of a Stalin who had never been in the position to give an order . So he had in the last year suffered a series of strokes instead . Richard and Brooks argued that they had to return to New Haven at once , but having made up his mind to see his father Lou was incapable of postponing the visit . Embarrassed , apologeticbut unswervable , Lou left them arguing on the porch of the Black House , and drove into the center of the little old town . This morning the Green had a kind of lackadaisical animation ; the Colonial mansions and the Congregational church looked a little less like relics . He turned into a side street and stopped in front of his oldp90house , lost in trees and shrubbery , low-roofed , white , a little shabbier and more unkempt than when he had last seen it . His father would not be particularly surprised to see him . Lou went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scrappy front yard , over the squeaking porch , sinking with each step into all the feelings surrounding this house which he had never solved . He stepped into the modest front hall with its old Victorian sofa and coat rack , and called out , " Dad ? Father ? " before remembering that , in his last stroke , his father had been struck dumb . There was a scraping in the upstairs hall , and Lou grabbed the newel post and sprang up the narrow stairway . His father stood in a long maroon and gray bathrobe leaning forward , his big hands clutching the top bar of his aluminum " walker . " His face was flushed and his eyes were bright . He was trying to speak . Lou went up and embraced him , and his father tried to speak . They moved , Lou following , to the far end of the hall and into a medium-sized rugless room with the sun coming in by its three windows . Until he went into the Marines this had been his bedroom ; Mr. Colfax used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been changed ; it now contained a rocker with a large oval table beside it , a large television set on which this morning the sound was turned off , and the screen showed a lady busily kneading dough and apparently talking loquaciously . There was also a plain wooden chair . Lou started to aid his father into the rocker , but sensing that this would be resented he stood until Mr. Colfax had lowered himself into it and then sat in the other chair . Then Lou started to talk . With his family he had until now been as wordless as possible , all his life . Now  --  too late ?  --  he started to talk . " Well I should have come sooner to see you , I know , but getting things settled at Yale took up all my time , and I did n't figure you 'd miss me that much . " His father watched him with a kind of eagerness , his mouth moving slightly . " I 've had a fairly tough time , to tellp91you the truth . I 've never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything before . I did n't lie either , I just did n't tell the truth . So here goes . I just was n't cut out for the Marine Corps , and they figured that out fairly fast and so I did n't serve my full term . No , not a dishonorable discharge , I was just let out for the convenience of the service , ' and if things ever get really drastic , the Chinese Reds start landing in San Diego or something like that , why , they 'll call me back . They 'll never do it for anything less , believe me ! Were they glad to get rid of me . Boy . " Lou leaned forward , elbows on knees , his large hands clenching and unclenching , badly needing occupation . Usually he sketched whenever possible , the cross-section of a jet engine , or endless personal modifications of the Piccard bathyscaphe he would build and test someday , he hoped . He knew this manual restlessness was the kind other people relievedby smoking cigarettes , but he had too vivid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of lung tissue , too clear an image of the stains smoking would splatter on it , to use cigarettes except under extreme pressure . He had chainsmokedin the Marine Corps . " I know I never opened myself up with you before . Could n't help it . I was too afraid of you , in case you want to know the truth . I mean the way you used to throw me around the room , this room come to think of it , slapping me around because my cats were out and I could n't get them to come in and their yowling was keeping you awake . Everything kept you awake . If it had n't been that , it would have been pins dropping somewhere . You did n't trust sleep . Or anything else . So you 'd slap me around for a while . You kept it right up until that time I was sixteen and you took me on and a funny thing happened . I was stronger than you were . You felt it . And so , that was it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I let you seem to win . But you knew who won it . Remember ? " I 'm just trying to make one point . You 're a mistake . " Lou examined his nervous hands , and then continued . " Do you hear me ? I do n't know whether you hear anymore . I think maybe that 's gone too . " His father 's eager eyes stayed on him.  | " And your mind , how clear is it ? I hope you hear , I hope you think because maybe you can tell me what to do , maybe you have some key . Mother was a mistake too , a different kind of mistake , all nerves and submission and passiveness . A  --  uhfriendof mine was shocked the way I acted at mother 's funeral . But how , how do you mourn the death of someone who really did n't want to live ? Who never came into contact with you ? Who , when any issue in your life came up , said , I pass ' like a bridge player @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aunt Lydia ! Nothing but breakdowns , and all that about becoming a TV star  --  at fifty ! No talent !  --  and my God , Aunt Marguerite has n't really sobered up in the last thirty years . And what about good old Bill ? Jesus . And what about the great Philip Colfax Clinger , that great American . What about any of them ! " Here he caught himself , was still for a moment , and then slowly , sadly , added , " What about any of us ? " " I do n't want to be a mistake . I do n't want to be like you or like any of them . I 'm myself , I 'm nature 's fresh try to make something good , something that works . I do n't give a shit how pretentious it sounds : it 's the truth . I 'm supposed to be perfect , yes , perfect . But all my relatives are mistakes and now I 'm scared to death I 'm  --  I 'm going to be one too , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't want to be another human flop . Ca n't I shake this screwed-up family off ? I must . I must . " There 's another thing . There 's Charlotte . I think we I think she we  --  uh  --  had have a son , " he stuttered , staring for a while out the window at the fresh Connecticut morning . " What in the world am I going to do about a son . Me . College sophomore . Marine reject . She also happens to be married now to somebody else , by the way . Just a detail . Yes ! " He rubbed the palms of his hands briskly together in a parody of ambition and energy . " A son . " He stared out the window some more . " The next generation . Already . " He continued his staring . " And me with myself not worked out , not ready , not right . I wanted it all to be perfect , for my son , my children , when they came , someday . Not all screwed-up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't ready to be a father . You did n't under/stand yourself enough to be a father . Maybe nobody does . Well , I was going to , I was going to be ready , to be right . And now , here it is ! Now ! " You see I would n't care if it was just some girl I happened to knock up by mistake . I would n't think it was my son really , not really . Yes , I 've had sex with quite a few girls , for quite a few years , considering I 'm not quite twenty-one , but I guess that 's the way it is when most other parts of your life do n't work and that one does . That 's the way it is . " But this was n't some other girl , this was Charlotte , " he was silent for a while . " Well , " he then went on more softly , " this was Charlotte , and Charlotte had a lot of power . She had power over me , my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power over her too . There was a tremendous exchange going on between us all the time . We fueled each other . Not a very romantic idea , is it ? It was too fundamental to be romantic . It was a matter of life and death . And look what happened . We created a new person , Charlotte and I , and if I do n't function as that baby 's father I lose damn near everything , do n't I ? And yet I 'm so screwed-up . Well that 's just the way it goes sometimes . And do n't tell me the son is n't mine . I mean , yes , tell me , learn to speak again just for ten seconds , will you , and say , Son , that son is n't yours , son ' or something like that and I can wash my hands of it . That 's why I 've been sitting here rubbing my hands together , I suddenly realize , wash my hands of it . " He paused and looked at his hands . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put his hands on his knees and stared anew at the morning , contemplating it . " Maybe he is n't my son . Just because she brought him to the Black House does n't prove anything . Maybe it 's just her Limey sense of humor . One time she made one of the students in her drama class put on a lot of theatrical make-up so he 'd look older , gray temples and mustache and all that , and he came with her to the Black House and said he was from MGM and wanted me to co-star in the next Elizabeth Taylor movie . Well I 'm not exactly ugly and things like that do happen sometimes . Charlottejust wanted to see how I 'd react . I told him I 'd consider it if there were oceanography classes in Hollywood . So thenp94they confessed . Maybe the baby is n't mine . Maybe it is n't . " In a way that thought is much worse , much worse . Charlottehaving somebody else 's son , that producer 's to be exact . That thought is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is my son though . Maybe he is . She kept saying she wanted to have a child with me and she meant it . Charlottemeant it . There was nothing silly about Charlotte . She wanted to be an actress but she never dramatized herself . She left that for the stage . In her life she knew what she wanted and she meant what she said and she knew about this power between us and she was in love with me and she wanted a child out of this power there was between us and I believe she got it , I believe she got it and what am I going to do about it , me , Louis Colfax , fool ? " You might have set me up a little better in life . I do n't mean money , God knows . I mean not slap me around so much and notice God damn it that I had some talents and encouragethem a little bit and not be so crazy yourself . " He stared for a while at the old man , who was eagerly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loved him all the same , helpless now , never to slap again . His father had loved him , crazily , in his way , very much . " It was n't really your fault , " Lou mumbled , " because your father was a repressed homicidal maniac . I know that . And his father was some other kind of monster , no question about it , and on and on . And it 'll never stop unless somebody has the will and brains to break the chain , break the chain . Who ? Why me , that 's who . That 's who I hoped it would be . Except my God here 's the next generation already , my God . " His father was looking at him with a kind of eagerness and seemingly trying to speak . A burst of vexation came out in the old man , a last bubble from that great volcanic temper ; he struggled with his mouth and then hit the palm of one hand with the fist of the other . His big left hand , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , gestured vaguely toward the table . There was a pad and pencil there . Lou got up and handed them to his father . Placing the pad carefully on his knee , gathering his hand around the pencil , Mr. Colfaxp95began to write painstakingly . Then he handed what he had written to his son . " Be careful . Your last chance , " it seemed to read . Hands rigid , Lou held this message and studied it , and then looked up at his father , who was now looking at him more calmly , almost sternly , as he used to do . Maybe he ca n't hear a word , Lou reflected , and maybe his mind is gone . And maybe he can , and maybe it is n't . He drove the Morgan back to the Black House , picked up Brooks and Richard , who were vigorously impatient to be off . As they were going out the front door Brooks looked back into the main room and said with a smirk , " Do n't you want to take that snapshot with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but crossing the porch said flatly , " Bring it " ; chortling , Brooks snapped it off the wall , they got into the Morgan , and drove back to New Haven.  |p96New  England has the most violent climate in the world . It hurtles from pre-tropical August to sub-arctic January and hurtles back again , forcing the foliage through the most drasticchanges in nature , erupting with blooms for a brief spell , then exploding with autumnal colors , then abruptly gaunt as death and swiftly on into luxuriant bloom again . The inhabitants of New England must go through similar desperate accommodations to this anarchic climate , alternatelybrown-skinned as Polynesians and sallow as monks , subject to heat prostration and pneumonia , snow-bound and heat-waved , given to fall 's energy and then summery languors , responding to rustles of spring and depths of winter , naked as jaybirds and then bundled as bears , hurrying along on the heels of the seasons ' changes all their lives , unresting , ever on the alert to what 's next , brittle from the fatigue of forever adapting to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seasonal swings , the jungle climate is tepid and the desert 's bland , Europe 's banal and Asia 's glum . No atoll or outpost must deal with a climate as irascible as New England 's . Lou Colfax wondered if he could do anything about it . " Ifp97we could divert the Gulf Stream  --  " he began to Clement Jonaz , sitting in the latter 's cubicle in the library stacks . " Louis , you 're mad , " Clement began lightly , and then noticingthe despair suddenly fall over his friend 's face he quickly amended , " You 're all wrong , divert the Gulf Stream , even you Americans ca n't do that . " Lou promptly forgot these fears for his sanity in the argument . " Do n't give me that you Americans ' crap and yes we can , eventually . We 're going to have to do that and a lot more than that with the oceans if we have any plans for the survival of the human race . Do you have any plans for the survival of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " For humanity surviving . Do n't tell me you 've been sitting here graphing breast-feeding patterns among the Tahitians when you have no plans to save humanity . " " I have my plan . It 's very clear . Overturn America  --  " " Later , later . Now listen to me . The ocean is the largest fact on earth , right ? " " Y-e-e-e-s-s-s . " " People are starving in many parts of the world . " " I 'll say they are , even and especially here and  --  " " Later , later . I want to tell you something . " " You always want to tell me something  --  " " Later . Listen . By 1980 the underdeveloped countries of the world will need three hundred million tons of additional grain annually to survive . That is the combined output today of the United States and Europe . There is nowhere to get what they need . They will all starve . " He leveled a stare on Clement for several baleful seconds . Then he went on . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every year ! " He stared at him some more . " But nobody harvests it ! The sea . . . the sea is like a huge farm , and it 's all around us and we sit in the middle starving , its crops are rotting away because nobody tends them , harvests them . It 's some kind of huge , ignored , swaying granary . Nobody ever goes inside . All that nourishmentin the sea is loose there , loose , floating all around , salvation , loose , untended , rotting . It 's the answer . And it'sp98here . So what do we do . We sit here staring out into space like some kind of idiot child , Daddy me want to go b-e-e-a-u-wg-h-up there ! ' pointing up at the moon ! It 's as sterile as those cigarette ashes . That 's all the moon is , ashes . And we want to go up there . " " Down , boy , down . You 're getting shrill . " " Later . Listen . You 've heard all the bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? I 've got a good one for you . The fish harvest is increasing faster than the population . Our way of farming ' the sea is like using a wooden farrow to plow on land , but still it 's producing the only hopeful statistic we 've got . " " Well Louis , I suppose that is a point . " " Thanks . Listen . If we ever efficiently harvested the sea we 'd solve the food problem tomorrow . And if we cultivated it , fertilized it , well , we could have all the food everybody in the world would ever want . " Lou was doodling the cross-sectionof something ; Clement watched it taking form . " That 's the field I might go into , aquiculture . It does n't exist , except in Japan , and even there they only use it to produce cultured pearls . That 's typical . " " I always thought in your heart of hearts you had your  --  mercenary side . Money and all . Maybe you want to save humanity but I notice you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , then he said , " Do you know how many hundreds of billions of dollars of oil are under the ocean ? They do a little off-shore drilling now . If I learned how to go after the deep oil , well , forget it . I 'd be King Midas . " Silence . Clement looked at him . " Well ? " More silence , then Lou said , " I could do both ! Save humanity , be a super-millionaire ! " " I rather doubt you could do both . Nobody ever has . One or the other , Louis , you 'll have to aim at one or the other . It 's the aim that 's crucial , you ca n't reach any goal like that without aiming at it years before , aiming at it now , Louis Colfax , sophomore . You 'll have to choose now , wo n't you ? " A longer silence , then " Yes , " curtly.  | " Well ? " There was no comment from Louis Colfax , sophomore . That evening Lou @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suite in Pierson College reading . The book was Jules Verne 's Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea and while he was enjoying it he had to break off frequently to sketch improvements in the submarine described . Gordon Durant stalked in in his dressing gown looking for a cigarette . " Where are your cigarettes ? " he said . Lou paused , and then he said , " I like the old-fashioned courtesy you always have when you 're asking for something . " Surprised by this show of spirit , Gordon became confused and as a diversion noticed the sketches . " What are these ? " Lou explained , and a look of something almost bordering on tolerance painfully worked its way toward the surface of Gordon 's craggy face . " You 're interested in the underseas , " he commented . " Yes , really interested . Algae trap energy , you know , and then they 're eaten by fish and that makes plenty of protein and you know half the children in backward countries die before they 're five years old because of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thoughts , Lou had started to bore and alienate his listener once again , as he so often did in his enthusiasms , and knowledge . He stopped short , and flicked a glance at Gordon 's face , to confirm that the inevitable expression of boredom and disgust was there . So many people were disgusted by the knowledge others possessed . Strange . Lou himself was fascinated by and grateful for the new knowledge he encountered in others when , very infrequently , that happened . But Gordon was listening with knit brows and an expression of interest . " Yes , " he said , " I knew that . " " You did ? " " Yes . " They looked at each other analytically , and then Gordon said , " May I borrow that cigarette ? "  | " Oh sure  --  it 's right I think I mean  --  oh . " He grinned as blindingly as he could . " I do n't smoke . " If only he really smoked ! If only he had tar-coated lungs and cancer tissue of a constant smoker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his absurd " Oh sure ! "  --  those uncontrollablenerves again !  --  had made himself ridiculous once more : still at the bottom of the moat looking up . Durant raised his eyebrows , and then left the room . For the next hour Lou suffered the tortures of the man who said he had made the Titantic unsinkable : he could not toleratehis own absurdity ; he could not escape it . So he finally got up , half-sprinted past Gordon in his armchair in the living room , muttering , " Get a cup of coffee ! " and went out , up the outside stairs to the room of Richard Anders . Fortunately he found Richard alone in the suite , at his desk studying . " Excuse me , can I just talk to you for five minutes ? " " Take ten , " said Richard , leaning back in his chair and taking off his shell-rimmed glasses . " You know the college dog  --  " " Thunder . " " I know he 's mangy and a mutt and a few other things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 's so mangy and such a mutt . I 've been going by him outside the dining room ever since the start of the term and I noticed something . He 's a real big-city loner type of dog . He 's indifferent , you know , he has a real guarded look in his eyes , he 's joyless , a scavenger , worldweary , seen it all . Well anyway today , I said to myself that I was going to reach Thunder . I thought he needed me . I knew he needed me . He looks like such a cynic , Thunder does , but I knew that was all on the surface . So I brought him out a piece of meat from lunch and offered it to him and he ate it , no expression , no wagging , he just ate and looked away . I petted him , praised him , I tried everything . Could n't please him . Could n't displease him either . I did n't have anything to do with his real problems , so he did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Good night , " and he pounded down the stairs , through the living room of his suite , undressed , got into bed , and failed , once again , to sleep.  |p101The  next morning when he , not awoke , but came out of the sort of stupor or coma into which eight hours of proneness in a darkened room had sunk him , Lou gazed at the moody , sliding gray sky over New Haven , a lowering fall day , a dead day , and the bloodless , dry , unreal world he had escaped from with Charlotte Mills at this season two years ago began to descend implacably over him . He was going to get into emotionaltrouble ; he was already in deep emotional trouble . He did not know whether he could get out of bed . He knew that if he spoke his voice would have lost its natural resonance , that now it would be kind of furry , a querulous tone . Go to the master of Pierson College for help . Go to the university psychiatrist . Go to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He turned over and gazed in despair out the window , across the moat , at the picked fence . Go to your closest friend . He did not have one . Go to your girl friend . He did not have one . Go to your parents . He did not , really , have one . Get a dog . Thunder . . . Lou felt he was about to lose control . He had to do something . Self-pity , the most negative emotion of them all , the one from which nothing good could flow , worse than hate , jealousy , anything , he was lying in this bed wrapped in self-pity as in a winding sheet . That did it . Lou swiftly got out of bed , cleaned up , dressed , got into his Morgan and drove at top speed through the gloomy New England day to Stowe , Vermont , arriving back at Pierson College at midnight . " Where 've you been ? " asked Durant neutrally from his armchair . " I drove to Stowe , Vermont , and back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well . " All the same , after thinking Louis Colfax over , Gordon wentp102to the master 's office of Pierson the next morning and said there was " no hurry " about the roommate change after all . The next day was Saturday . Desperately running from that self-pity , Lou lurched into Clement Jonaz 's room . " Let 's go to the football game . " Clement slowly lowered his pen to his desk . " The what ? " He said it as Charlotte had ; Clement had been partly educated in England . Lou filched at the remembered inflection . ( " The what ? " Charlotte had said incredulously . " I said , let 's go to the flicks . . . movies . " " Oh , the films , the cinema . " " Do n't give me that . You know what the flicks are . " " I do n't ! " " I  --  uh  --  let 's go to the football game , " Lou repeated a little breathlessly . " You know , like rugby , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've never sat through one in my life . You really have gone bers  --  you really are  --  strangely notional this weekend , Louis . Whatever made you think I had time to watch middle-class Americans acting out their **28;12960;TOOLONG against each other , preparatory to unleashingthem on the emerging peoples ? " " Oh shit . " " Your own need to use a club in the war-substitute you yourself have chosen  --  lacrosse  --  just shows your own hostilitiesare both more primitive and nearer the surface . " " I 'll say they are . Shall we go to the football game ? " Clement sighed . " All right . Who 's Yale expressing its blood lust against this time ? " " As a matter of fact , I think it 's Army . " " I 'm not surprised , not at all . I hope you do n't expect me to yell or do any of that unison crying out " " Just be company for me . " The bantering tone ended with that . " All right , Lou , yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and along York Street , past Davenport College and the entrance to Pierson College . None of the Yale colleges was accessible one from the other . The student had to go to the no-man's-land of the street , then cross the moat and drawbridge to enter the neigh/boring college ; for just as the university was prepared to withstand assault from the town , each college within the university had been built to repel attack from all of the others . ' Clement , clad in his deerstalker hat and Sherlock Holmes cape-coat , remarked on this armed-camp aspect of Yale once again . " When you consider who provided the money for constructingthese bastions  --  Whitneys , Harknesses , Vanderbilts , and so on  --  you realize that the design reflects very deeply and accurately the psyche of the donors . The assumption of people who make huge fortunes in your country  --  I 'm talking about the first generation  --  is of course that of a robber baron , raiding all the surrounding country for his own profit and so creating enemies all around him , and only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 'd been even richer than they were , they would have provided each individual student with his own private fortress and own individual cannon . " They reached Fraternity Row , where the elation of a footballweekend , of dressy girls , of fraternity houses which for once had a purpose other than sheltering pool tables and bars , had caught up the street into a gusty late October festiveness . Cars and crowds and furs and corsages , yells and giggles and honking and beer , through it Clement , with intellectual MarxistBritish Colonial composure , and Lou , with mad Colfax envy , made their way to the Yale Bowl . Arriving there , they trooped in , sat down , stood up for the kickoff , and the game began . The other team was not Army after all ; it was Dartmouth . They sat down again . Clement watched it as an exercise in stylized aggressiveness , and had to admire it from that point of view . " There are several ingenious actings-out of the death wish in this ritual , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ball when each manifestation begins  --  " " The center . " " Yes . The posture he must assume , legs spread , bending down and looking upside down through his own legs back at his own altar  --  " " You mean the goal posts ? "  | " Yes . That 's very significant . The devil cults of the Maubi have a similar placation posture . I wo n't go into all the anal erotic meanings now ... " " All right . " "  --  but they ought to be obvious . " Dartmouth scored a touchdown . Clement sat wordless and motionless through the dejection surrounding him , cogitating . The extra-point conversion was attempted , the ball centered to the holder , and the place-kicker stepped forward and kicked it between the uprights of the goal post . Clement was electrified . " Marvelous , " he cried , " really marvelous . A truly successful acting-out of altar defilement . He scoops that filthy ball up from the very mud itself with his foot and kicks it into the very center of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . . . oh , I see . Now they 're getting another chance . Dartmouth kicks it up from the mud toward the other altar . . . uh-huh , does n't work , the other army captures the trophy and starts back . I must say , there surely is a monographhere at least , if not a dissertation . Religio-Erotic ConfrontationRituals in American Football . Where is everybody going ? " " It 's the half . " " The what ? " Again Charlotte 's querulously humorous English " The what ? " echoed inside Lou 's bead . Blast England and her accent , and her snapshot and her scrawls on walls . " The half-time . The game is half over . " " Is it really ? " he said gratefully . " Yes . " What do they do in the second half . The birth trauma ? " " The same as the first . " " Must we stay ? " " No , " said Lou wearily . " I guess not . " Sitting passively watching the game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when listening to the Jonaz commentary . They went out through the tunnel to the track behind the Bowl . Outside Portal Fifteen there was as usual a certain chic mingling of couples ; furs , blondes , leather gloves , binoculars ,  |p105fur-trimmed  boots , long and bright scarves , thermos bottles and flasks . As Clement , looking like a mulatto Sherlock Holmes , and Lou , looking like a Russian anarchist , moved past this crowd , Mrs. Taloumi Durant stepped in front of them , fur hat , fur coat , blond hair , big eyes , smiling widely . " There you are ! My spy . What are you doing here ? " " We 're just leaving , Mrs. Durant , " Lou began shyly , " becauseuh . . . " " Because it is a bore . Grown up men pushing each other down like little boys ! " Clement could be heard almost to purr with pleasure at this . Lou introduced them , and each , sensing something singular , egregious , in the other , acknowledged the introduction enthusiastically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said in her penetrating voice . " Where is that ex-stepson who dragged me here ? Gordon ! " Durant , one of the three Yale undergraduates who still dared to wear a raccoon coat , came lumbering toward them out of the crowd in it . Eyeing him , Norma said to Lou , " Where are you going ? " " We were just going to visit a  --  uh  --  unique person here at Yale , someone very very interesting , a unique person here at Yale , someone  --  " " I go with you ? " " Please ! " They wended their way through the parking lot to Norma 's car , an ancient Cadillac convertible . " I bought it in Hollywoodmany years ago . " She began backing and changing gears energetically . " I did n't know you were in Hollywood ! " said Lou , fascinated . Hollywood had always bored him sick , but he was not himself any more , he suddenly realized ; he was fascinated because Charlotte would have been fascinated . I identify too much with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everyplace . Hollywood was crap , pure crap . I hate Hollywood . Los Angeles is the most ugliest city that ever was . You have been in Los Angeles ? No , eh . Well , do n't go . Which way we go ? "  |p106Lou  directed her away from New Haven for a short distance and then right along Forest Road , on a wooded bluff overlooking the city . " Is this the way to . . . that person 's house ? " inquired Clement politely from the back seat , hoping by his question to learn whether Lou had an actual " unique person " in mind , or was going to lead them in circles until the car ran out of gas  --  which would not be unlike him  --  or deliverthem to the doorstep of the President of the University  --  which would not be unlike him either . " Is n't the Stoetzers ' house this way ? " " Oh , " said Clement , " yes , of course it is . " The Stoetzers would be perfect , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take this exotic lady who had inexplicably landed in their midst . She was talking on . " One thing I do not permit people to inflict on me is boredom . Ennui . That , never . I have been heart-broken , I have been robbed , I have been beaten . I say , okay . It is part of life . But I have not been bored . Never . When Durant start to bore me , I leave him and I leave his money too . If I smell boredom , like a  --  what you call that small animal with a stripe on the back ? " " A skunk ? " " Like a skunk creeping near me , I run away . As I do now . You are so sweet to take me to meet this unique person . Who is he ? " " Oh , a kind of local sage , a character . Myron Stoetzer , and Mrs. Stoetzer . He wrote a play once called The Colors of the Rainbow . Never could write another . So he 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " It 's impossible not to have a wise man near , " observed Norma . " Is he a priest ? " " Of course not , " said Lou . " He 's married . " " In Greece our priests are married sometimes . " " I did n't know you were Greek , " said Lou . " Of course I am . The only thing not Greek about me is my name . Norma is not a Greek name . But my mother loved the opera Norma so that is what she call me . Yes , in Greece our priests are married sometimes . It is much better . How can ap107man who is not married help and advise with the problems of marriage , of sex , and that is the root of all problems . " " He prays , " said Lou experimentally , " and gets inspiration . " Norma growled something in Greek . Then she said , " The Colors of the Rainbow ? Les Couleurs de l'Arc en Ciel ? I think I know that play . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am thrilled . " " They will be too . They love to meet new people . " Myron and Vilma Stoetzer looked through the window of their library and saw the unknown convertible turn through the gate into the spacious gravel spread before the door of their Greek Revival house . " Oh my God ! " she exclaimed in her liquid alto . " Now whom have you invited ? " he demanded in his slightly drawling , cultivated voice . A somewhat Hitlerian lock of black hair fell over his forehead . At sixty he had the face of a ruined boy . Vilma , with her thick brown hair cut short and her full figure , bore a marked resemblance to the Rumanian Communist leader , Ana Pauker . A fire was burning in the grate . Books extended from floor to ceiling . The Stoetzers watched the car stop . They were being assaulted by the pangs of the overhospitable , the suddendeprivation of the one afternoon they had planned to sit alone , speechless , shoeless , and let their facial muscles rest and fall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ habit into that shy boyish smile , hers to resume its set look of sardonic , slightly dazed interest . " I did n't ask anybody , I do n't think , " she said in her hoarse alto . " Who in the world is that in that strange hat , and cape ? " " Clement Jonaz , certainly . No one else dares wear clothes like that . You have to have mixed blood for that kind of courage . " " " I suppose so , " she murmured . " Well , I 'm glad that 's who it is . At least he 's subversive . Who 's the other student ? " " All in black . Like a ghoul . Of course it 's  --  "  | " Louis Colfax . Well , he 's mad as a hatter , so at least it wo n't be dull . And whose date would that be ? " " Maybe both . A menage a trois . " " What fun ! " Somewhat cheered up , Mr. and Mrs. Stoetzer began getting out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ice , the gin , the Scotch , the brandy . They never entertained a non-drinkingstudent twice ( " This is n't a nursery school " ) . Twenty minutes later the vodka and gin and Scotch had reached the blood streams of hosts and guests , and communicationbegan . " Is your husband a professor ? " Norma asked Mrs. Stoetzer . " Oh no . He 's what they call a fellow of one of the colleges . Nothing , in other words . We just like to be in a university community . We find people are more original in university communities . And also Myron is an alumnus . People are more original in university communities , are n't they ? " Mrs. Stoetzer pursued in the rather provoking manner she used with women , whom she almost always disliked . " I do n't know , " said Norma carelessly . " I never been in a university much . I think it is naive here , very naive . Is that the same thing ? " " No , not at all , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She had sensed the hostility inside this rather ungainly woman and been bored by it . Life was too short even to return Mrs. Stoetzer 's hostility . Calling across the room Norma said , " You are naive , no , you , my spy ? " Lou , sunk in one of the deep , box-shaped chairs next to the meditative fire , pulled himself up . " Yes , " he answered simply . " Yes , I 'm naive . " " He is n't , " continued Norma , indicating Clement . " And my husband , Oh Pythoness , " inquired Mrs. Stoetzer with a stretched smile . Glancing at her and instantly away again , Norma exclaimed to the room , " Ach , I talk too much , as always . You are a great man , sir , a great writer . Are you naive ? "  |p109From  the matching chair facing Lou 's , Mr. Stoetzer , after making demurring noises about his greatness , answered , " Hopelessly . No one can spend his life among college students , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Of course , the students are changing . " " Is it true ? In what way ? " Deeply interested already , Norma drew her legs in light-colored slacks under her on the couch next to Mrs. Stoetzer , to hold herself from hurrying across the room to sit at his feet . Like all erratically intelligent women of little education , Norma was enthralled by brilliant men , and felt that this must be one . Mrs. Stoetzer noticed this and her animal dislike of Norma declined a shade : Myron badly lacked feminine admiration at Yale . Lou noticed it and was hugely relieved : he had supplied the promised " unique person . " " When I was a student here , a thousand years ago , " Mr. Stoetzer explained in his pleasant , if marbles-in-the-mouth , voice , " we did a certain amount of conversing in Latin . Would you believe the change in my lifetime ? Now , Yale admits these winning  --  in every sense of the word  --  young men who just do n't want to be bothered with anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to know English grammar , let alone Latin . Present company excepted , to be sure . Clement is virtually the most brilliant student in the Graduate School and was partly educated in Britain . That saved him . Louis has his own sort of distant drummer and hears all kinds of illuminating things . " Both students dutifully blinked and beamed . " But the rest ? Urchins , most of them . Proper clothing is beginning to disappear , and I expect in another ten years they 'll be wearing animal skins and rags , like a cross between Arab street beggars and Laplanders . Our climate here means even beggars have to have a variety of dress . We had a code of manners in my day and we were really naive . How was the football game ? " he suddenly asked all of them . " A bore . " " Childish . " " Could n't sit through it . "  |p110After  a silence Mr. Stoetzer went on , " I have an Intelligence Quotient  --  if those silly tests mean anything  --  I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every football game played at Yale all my four years , absorbed . Absorbed . It was an expression of school spirit in those days . AU that 's gone glimmering . Most of the other things will go too , " he muttered . " It 's the dean of admissions , of course who recreates Yale regularly , like some mad alchemist in his cell with his herbs and potions . More of this ! Less of that ! SometimesI wonder if it 'll all blow up in his face some day . " " Oh Myron do n't be silly and gloomy , " Mrs. Stoetzer said . " What 's a university for , " put in Clement , " except to give very bright people a first-class education . Nobody has time for school spirit ' or all those gentlemanly ' things any more . There 's too much to learn . We 're . . . well , they 're too busy . I think I 'm closer to the students than you are , Myron . They 're deeply sensitive , much more so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beginning to disappear . It 's the special spirits who are increasing . They 're careless about dress , true . But they 're becoming more interested in ideas , and eventually I think in ideals , than before . I think the dean of admissions is really quite a good chemist . " " I hope so , " sighed Mr. Stoetzer vaguely . Norma had kept her big green eyes fixed on each speaker in turn . Now she turned to Lou . " What do you think , Louis Colfax ? " " What do I think ? " He had been designing a habitable underseas bubble in his mind while following the conversation . " I just , well , the Yale student body ? I do n't know , it 's like asking me what 's inside my head , what it looks like , I just ca n't see it , because it 's me . . . She studied him . Then she said , " Good , " decisively . Lou did n't understand in what way his fumbling answer had been good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back in a way which made him lurch inside . " Louis , " said Mr. Stoetzer from his Scotch , " is not a happy boy . " " No , " mumbled Lou humbly.  | " He 's quicksilver , " said Mrs. Stoetzer from her gin , " he 's a dragonfly . There is only one of him . He 's one of those serials , those cliff-hangers movie houses used to show . No one knows how it will come out , least of all Lou . " " No , " he mumbled . " He is n't of this generation , " added Mr. Stoetzer , " or any other . " " Just a spook , " mumbled Lou . " I wonder what time it 's getting to be . " " Why do you say these things ? " said Norma intently . " It is true ? " ignoring Lou , the patient , she asked the Stoetzers , the diagnosticians . " Louis is very singular , " said Mr. Stoetzer meditatively . " What will happen , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ valuable mind . . . no one . . . " then recollecting himself , he said with his customary cheerfulness , " we expect great things of you , Lou , " and then the Scotch flowing through his system reasserted the upper hand , " provided  --  " " Provided ? " pursued Norma . " We 're embarrassing the poor boy  --  " " Provided ! " she insisted , glaring . " You can not stop now . " " He . . . well , his family , if he gets control , we all have our nerves to contend with . " " Yes , " said Lou , flashing a grin , " our nerves ! Shudder , shudder . I am nervous . Just ask the Marine Corps ! Could I .. . some vodka . . . When the drinks had been refreshed , and everyone was settled again in the comfort of this grand yet intimate library , suffused as it was with the warmth of reading and wood-fire , of money and learning , of older hosts and young students @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Norma suddenlysaid , " You know why I maybe am a prophetess like  --  this woman call me , when she said Oh Pythoness , ' meaning Apollo 's oracle , of course ? " ( Norma usually drank little ; the vodka was busily putting her brain cells to sleep , which was why Mrs. Stoetzer had become " this woman . " ) " Because I feel very wide and I feel very deep and this is all that is necessary to be a prophetess . You know why ? Because I feel otherp112people 's feelings , not only my own . It is so easy to be sensitive ! To feel for yourself ! To feel hurt by others , feel this , feel that , hurt feelings , reactions , complexes , all that , about yourself ! But to feel about others ! That is the true sensitivity , the other is just crap , useless , selfishness , every boring person and every neurotic person in the world has that ! I have the other , thank God . I feel what you feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am a prophetess . That is all that is necessary . So I know the lives of others , even their destinies sometimes . " She settled her gaze on Lou . " Louis Colfax ? You have , as you say , great hopes ' for him provided . ' I will tell you ! Listen . " She laughed penetratingly . " The Pythoness will tell you ! Listen . " She began to sway , humming , eyes almost closed . " There is a young woman , a girl . Yes . I see one young woman . But I ca n't see if she is in his future or in his past . Could she be in both ? I do n't see that too clear . But I see one young woman . She will have much to do with his destiny . She may make a big mess of him . He is all vulnerable on his emotion side . I can smell it . He even think he is a little in love with me , which is adorable . He is all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His first and most important destiny . Everything else is alreadydecided . He will be some kind of very valuable person if he passes through what this woman does . Ach , it is true , since he is not destroyed yet then she must be in his future . Or else he has already survived her ! Or ! " Eyes suddenly open , she glared at Lou . " He will become stronger because of her , he will grow from what she put him through . It all depends . It all depends . Provided , as you say ! " Then she laughed . " May I have one more drink ? It 's a lot of crap I talk , parlor game . Is n't it ? " No one answered . Conversation became general for a while , and then Norma interrupted . " Who the hell 's that ! " pointing through the window . " Oh , merde . My stupid ex-stepson ! " Gordon Durant was plodding toward the front door accompanied by three other students and four girls . Their cars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their doors open . " Ah , Gordon , " said Mr. Stoetzer suavely , rising . " Get more glasses , Vilma. "  |p113Gordon  stormed in , explained that he had seen Norma 's car in the drive en route back to the campus from the game . " Who won ? " asked Mr. Stoetzer . " Hey Farwell , " called Gordon , " who won ? " " Gee , let 's see . Ginnie , who won the game ? " " Won ? Uh , I think it came out a tie or something , did n't it Lucie ? " " Did n't what ? " " The game . Come out a tie or something ? " " Gosh , I do n't know . I mean , there 's that man behind the scoreboard that 's supposed to be keeping track of the points and things . Billy , who won the game ? " " Dartmouth won thirty-two to nothing , and your seat cost $4.50 and I might as well throw it to the birds . " " I wish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Drinks ! " intoned Mrs. Stoetzer over the hubbub . " Taking orders for drinks ! " The room was now just too crowded for everyone to find a seat . So people knelt , leaned , sat on armrests , leaned against the mantlepiece , perched on the tiny stepladder serving the bookshelves . Norma suddenly cried out , " Stop ! There are thirteen people in the room ! Oh my God . I must leave . Thirteen . Danger , danger . " " Norma , " said Gordon , " be quiet . " " It is very dangerous , " she muttered . Neither Myron nor Vilma Stoetzer would permit a cocktail party being committed in their home . Promiscuous conversation was one of the few social practices which disgusted them . More chairs were brought ; a rough circle formed ; an intelligentconversation leading conceivably to the enlightenment of one or more persons was encouraged and , under their practicedprodding , took form . " We were discussing today 's student , " began Myron . That unleashed all the new arrivals . Gordon decisively agreed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decisively disagreed with him beyond that point . The other three young men had different but equally emphatic views and , althoughp114they were a little slower to express them , so did the girls . Gordon said , " Yale is letting in too many scholarship high school people and so , what do you expect ? The traditions have got to go . But ! Most of the traditions are stupid anyway so , to sum up , what Yale needs is frankly the cream of the crop , people with money and brains , and w  --  they will hammerout some new traditions for you , like giving polo and hunting a real place at Yale . " Billy said , " I think Yale is pretty okay the way it is , and if outsiders would mess out , mess out , then it would all go on being very okay . " Farwell said , " It 's all stuffy and boring and the courses have n't anything to do with what really counts today and , well , I like most of the guys but they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more training to go out and have a good life and succeed and . . . contribute ! " Three of the girls ' views meshed into an overriding sense that what Yale needed was co-education . But Ginnie said , " I think co-education is for the birds myself . I 've had a co-education , I go to Yale , the Drama School . It 's for the birds , excuse me , but that 's the way I 've seen it . You do n't know . . . " her voice trailed off , her glance slid around to settle on Lou , who was still inwardly wrestling with Norma 's prediction for him . Clement said , " Yale is a complete anachronism . The Yale Corporation is a combination of Wall Street and Washington at its most reactionary  --  Senator Taft  --  the curriculum is doing to us what the Americans say the North Koreans are doing to the prisoners of war , brainwashing , they 're brainwashingus here with the dogmas of capitalism with a thin overlay of bourgeois government planning , plus ancestor-worship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who 've never had an opportunity , or an impulse , to think in their lives . " After a long , ironic pause he added , " Present company excepted , of course . " Then he murmured , " I 'm a Negro so my views can be discounted by all of you . " " Clement has a lovely Brazilian grandmother , " Mrs. Stoetzer put in.  | " Black as the ace of spades , " said Clement . " I love her . She saved me from being like . . . the majority . " " My , are n't you hostile , " said Ginnie . Clement bowed formally . Lou took a longer look at him than he ever had before . Inside this tall , broad-faced man , with his hooded eyes , very slightly coppery skin , with all his reserve and scholarship , was there a raging , celebrating African beating a wild tom-tom of liberation ? Was it fading or getting louder ? Clement sat with his arms along the armrests of his chair , impassively contemplatinghis surroundings . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in these students , " put in Mrs. Stoetzer in her alto-soloist manner . " They 're the most vapid group I 've seen at Yale . Never say anything . Never do anything . I think the reason they dress badly is they have n't the energy to dress well . The Silent Generation , that they certainly are , as everybody knows . To me they 're simply bor-ing . " " The calm before the storm , " murmured Clement . ' What ? " asked Mrs. Stoetzer . " Yale is becalmed , " he amended , in the manner of a priest saying , " Missy est . " Reassured , Mrs. Stoetzer resumed her expression of dazed , sardonic interest . Norma leaned forward from the couch . " Louis , what do you think ? " He had been nervously digesting her prediction , resuming work on his underseas design , and continued following the conversation . As always , this complexity did not make for snappy opinion . Lou sat up straight , conscious of the derisive stare of Gordonfrom across the room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I think a lot of good points have been made , and I certainly agree with the co-education part , and I agree they ought to practically abolish the curriculum  --  there does n't seem to be anything to learn here , " he put in hurriedly , in spite of himself , for he always sought to hide his intellectual impatience , " and uh more courses in oceanogra/phy . But there is a lot in some of the past traditions and we do n't want to throw out the baby with the bath water , and still Clement 's point about Yale being just a sort of capitalist mirror has a lot in it , and . . . I do n't know . . . there 's a lot I would do but a lot I 'd like to save and there 's so much . . . I do n't know . . . " Norma was smiling at him in an odd , quizzicalway . " What did you say your name was ? " the girl called Ginnie inquired , leaning across toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He told her . " Oh " She looked very guiltily amused at that . " Oh . " " Oh ' what ? " " Oh . Nothing . Just . . . I 'm in the Drama School . " Lou just looked at her . " The Drama School , " she repeated . " I knew a student in the Drama School once . " " I know you did . " " Do you ever hear from her or . . . anything about her ? " " Yes . " Lou felt himself growing almost insanely angry at the little game this bitch was playing . He fixed the manic-depressive Colfax glare upon her . " How is she ! " he demanded in the family Boris Karloff voice . " She 's fine , " the girl replied rather shrilly . " Just fine " " Tell me what you know about her . " " Oh well , there 's not that much to tell . She 's married , you knew that , there 's this baby , you knew about that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to acting , I ca n't really feature Char as a mother , can you ? She wants to work and I heard she was up for something , some musical . She can sing and she 's really quite a good dancer , so who knows , she just might make it ! Would n't that be the end ! " " Yes , " mumbled Lou , meaning it . That really would be the end , if on top of deserting him and taking perhaps his own son away from him she became a great success in her field , Louis Colfax 's opinion of himself would reach that absolute zero known to physicists at which a substance becomes totally without movement or warmth.  | " That 's all I know , " Ginnie said , shaking her molasses-coloredcurls and retreating into her drink . Then she emerged again . " Char never would let me meet you . She said you were too dotty . ' " Ginnie giggled . " I thought she was afraid of the competition . But anyway ! I shared that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . . . the time you built that twenty-foot-long periscope or whatever it was and looked in our window ! " Lou flinched inwardly at the memory of that manic period just after the night he had failed to try to have a baby with her , that manic period when they were still , sadly , madly half living together . " And the time you came to see her disguised as the janitor and almost got away with it ... " ( She was having drinks on the sofa with the producer ; Lou had seen them go into the building together , raced to the Drama School where friends had disguised him " as a joke , " been admitted by Charlotte to the apartment , seen the man seated easily on the sofa , wanted to kill somebody , lost control of his voice , been recognized contemptuously  --  but also with secret amused pleasure ?  --  by Charlotte , ignominiously left ; that was the night he had gone to the Black House and stabbed himself in the gut , and it had not worked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said . " And I was still sharing the apartment with her when you know you began opening her mail and trying to tap the phone  --  " " Trying ! That tap worked ! " His pride of invention overcame his urge to deny guilt . " How 's your mother 's arthritis ? Did Ned pass chemistry at Poly Prep after all ? " After a shocked silence , Ginnie rallied . " Charlotte could have told you those things . Never mind ! All right , it worked . " They looked at each other . Then Ginnie felt moved to say , " She really did like you tremendously . I never knew why you drove her away by . . . persecuting her that way ... " At these words Lou felt that some day , sooner or later , the monumental mistakes of his life really would drive him to suicide . He had thought of it a great many times and attemptedit that once . The reason that attempt had failed was that in his wild rage and mortification he had used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by attacking the part of themselves which drove them to it : poison for those tormented by their appetites ; throwing themselves out of windows or off bridges for people hating their lack of identity ; slashing wrists for those who have identity all right and hate it and so want to drain away its very life 's blood ; and for Louis Colfax , when . . . if . . . the time came , he knew how to do it now : take a pistol and blow out his overactive , overjealous , overambitious , overdreamy , overintelligent brains . " She was always talking about you . Louis says ' and Louis thinks ' and Louis ' theory is . ' She sort of ran away from home and away from her country , she had a lot of nerve but she needed some kind of stability and she thought you were so bright you could give it to her . . . and then the periscope and you . . . you tried . . . after the janitor bit you tried . . . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's not , yes I  --  " Then Norma came up , Gordon in tow , and sat down on the arm of Lou 's chair , and put her arm over his shoulders . " You look very sad . " " We were talking about an old friend . " " You mean an old love . My God you are crazy as a lord . Never talk or think about the old love . It is suicide . " ( " Yes , " muttered Lou inaudibly . ) " It is today and tomorrow and next year that you must think about . If I ever look back at my past I would turn to salt , to stone . My mistakes are there like monsters to haunt me . But I never turn around . " " I guess you 're right , " Lou murmured . " Of course she 's right , " said Gordon . Norma gazed analytically up at him , her head tilted back , blond hair tumbling around her shoulders . " Gordon , " she asked , " what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about that war in Asia ? " " Korea ? What do I think ? I think we give them six more weeks and then if their side keeps stalling at the negotiation table we forget about the armistice and those privileged sanctuaries ' of theirs in the North and we bomb the daylights out of them . " " Six weeks , " echoed Noima reflectively . " Why six weeks ? "  | " That 's all the time we can let them have . Then we have to take advantage of our superior airpower . " " I see . What do you think , darling ? " touching Lou on top of the head . After a pause Lou began slowly , " Well , it 's pretty complicated , is n't it ? We have got superior airpower and all , but they have got six hundred million or whatever it is Chinese behind them  --  or do they ? Who knows , maybe the people of China are n't behind them ! It 's like quicksand if we sink into Asia too deeply , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allies in Asia then there 's the theory , " he went on reflectively , " that the Communists will knock over one country after another . . . of course there are some good things to be said for the Communistsystem .. . " Gordon snorted senatorially . " Most muddled mind I 've ever heard of . Thank you , Colfax , for talking in circles and tying yourself in knots for us . " He surveyed the two women for their approval . Ginnie smiled tentatively , but Norma 's analytical gaze upon Gordon now became autopsy-like . Then in her most penetratingvoice she said , " You are even more full of shit than I thought before . " She continued studying him . " Your head is a big piece of pig 's feet , like your father 's . What do you know ! Who are you ? Six weeks ! Why not five ? Why not seven ? You yell  --  you do n't know nothing . Let me tell you one thing . How old are you ? " she snarled . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large gulp of Scotch . " A boy who is certain of his opinions in his beginning twenties as you are , his head is pig 's feet . This one , " her hand sweeping toward Lou almost accidentally slapped him in the face , " He is youth , he is valuable , he has something inside him . Let me tell you one thing . Young people  --  the good ones among the young people  --  all of them feel here , in their hearts , that they have some  --  some great  --  message to deliver . They feel all heavy , loaded with some great thing in themselves . So that is why they are like Louis Colfax , they hesitate , they are cautious , they doubt , they see many sides . Why ?  |p120Because  they must know exactly where to deliver this great thing they have in themselves , who should they give it to , what is worthy of it , where to plant it ! But somebody like you ! You got nothing inside , just big bundles of pig 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know all the answers , you know exactly what to do because whatever you do does n't matter , you got nothing inside to deliver , nothing to lose . " This attack in Norma 's commanding voice had silenced the room . There was now a brief interlude of rattling of ice in glasses and the clearing of throats while the Stoetzers , whom everyone expected to change the subject , tacitly declined to do so . To divert attention artificially away from a confrontationlike this one seemed insincere and middle-class to them : Fight It Out , was their ruling principle . Myron Stoetzer now acted on it : " I know what you mean , " he said easily from his seat on the little stepladder . " Not about Gordon , " he added , not too hastily , " but in general about young , cocksure people . Year after year they come through Yale , generation after generation , and here they are chairmen of the News and leaders of this and spokesmen for that and heroes of something else , and then they go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are never heard of again , spent rockets , tooearlybloomers , Little Mr. Grown-Up at twenty-one and Little Mr. Nonentity at twenty-five , and fifty , and forever . " He gulped some Scotch . " There are some exceptions . " Gordon , who had never , as far as he was aware , been publicly insulted in his life before this , had passed through seven distinct , desperate emotional states : 1 . Incredulity : she ca n't be speaking to me ! 2 . Panic : She is ! 3 . Outrage : How dare she ? 4 . Violence : I 'm going to punch her in the mouth ! 5 . Mortification : Everybody is listening to her ! 6 . Counterattack : Which crushing rejoinder will destroy her best ? 7 . Anarchy : I 'm going to knock over the coffee table ! Now he reached a too-proud-to-fight stance . " Would you say I was one of the exceptions , Myron ? Norma 's a foreigner , so I do n't take her views seriously . " " The exception , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't you ? " cut in Norma . " Well , maybe youp121better . It 's true your money will save you from showing the world the mediocre man inside . Without the money , you would be digging ditches ten years from now . No . I am unfair . You are not without intelligence . You would be . . . let me see , I never ask myself this before . . . you would be , yes , how do you call people like that , chasseur blanc , someone who takes people on safaris in Africa to shoot beautiful animalsand hang their skins on the wall , Hemingway describes them  --  " " White hunters , " said Mr. Stoetzer . " Yes , that is you , if your name was Smith . " In extremity , Gordon 's face became contorted , his voice uncontrollable , " Norma , just because my father ditched you  --  " " Do n't tell me that crap about the scorned woman and her fury worse than hell ! I have no fury that your father divorce me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with that pig 's head so long ! That is my fury ! " She leaned toward Gordon , the firelightreflected in her full , tossed blond hair . " Do you know something , Gordon ? You will be richer because of me . Do you know how much alimony I ask from your father , do you ? No . He did not tell you that . I ask for none . Nothing . I ask him to pay for my lawyer in the divorce action and to send me my clothes . It is true he give me some jewelry and furs and I keep them . But I do not take any money . Why I take his money ? I do n't have any children with him , I have only myself to support , I am healthy , I will maybe marry somebody else one of these days , I take good photographs and supported myself before that way and now I do it again . Why would I ask him for any of his money ? I am not a whore , to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think I love him , mature older man , world traveler , he will understand me , complicated world wanderer like me . So I marry him . And he does n't understand me . And I understand him too well ! Too well . We lose interest in each other . So it is finished . Bye-bye . No money ! I want my clothes , my car from my Hollywood days , and for him to pay the lawyer . I spit on American lawyers and their fees . So there it is . You lose none of the Durant money on me ! And I do n't tell you these things aboutp122young people who know too much from revenge . I tell you ... well , because you are so cruel to Louis Colfax that you make an explosion inside my head and I say what is in it . I hate cruelty . And you are cruel . You have the heart of a white hunter . That is why I explain you to yourself . " Gordon had passed through four more powerful emotional states @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money ! 2 . Amazement : She 's telling the truth about the money ! 3 . Avarice : I 'm going to inherit my full share after all ! 4 . Alarm : She 's still making me look like an ass ! " Look gang , " he called out in his Racquet Club voice , " let 's get cracking . She 's raving on . There 's nothing worse than  --  " " One more thing I tell you . " Norma did not raise her voice , but it was such an instrument that the blur of Gordon 's sound disintegrated around the concentration of hers . " I say as soon as I come in this room that Yale University is naive . I feel that more strong than before now . You say bomb the North in the Asia war , eh ? You think that will end this war ? Never . This war will never end . I tell you why , my naive American . Wait . I was born in North Greece . There is much Turkish things there . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parents were Greek blood , but my mother was born in St. Petersburg , in Russia . In the Russian Empire . My father was born in Alexandria , in Egypt , that was in the British Empire then . Before it was in the Turkish Empire . Everywhere around us in the East Mediterranean we see the ruins of the great Roman Empire , and after that the great Byzantine Empire . In Lebanon where I go to school , that was in the French Empire when I go to school there . So . I know empires . I smell them . I taste them . I dream them . America has the biggest empire that ever been . Korea is on the frontier of it . All Europe that is not in the Russian Empire is in the American Empire . All Asia that is not in the Russian or Chinese Empire is in the American Empire . All South America is in the U.S.A. American Empire . Talk the truth to me , do n't talk myths ! We invented myths , we Greeks . We know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explain difficult things to children . Stop being children ! Forget myths ! Tell yourself the truth ! The fighting in Korea is on the frontierp123of your empire , the way the Romans were on the Danube and the Turkish people in the Balkans and the British in India and the Russians in the Caucasus and on and on and on . Of course your empire is more clever , more sophisticated . You do n't fly your U.S.A. flag over Paris , over Tokyo , you do n't have a U.S.A. Governor to run England . Sometimes you do n't even put some soldiers in there . But your military power and your money power decide everything in the end in Tokyo and Paris and England and everyplace in your empire . Sometimes a little country wants to drop out , like Egypt , or a big country , like India , and you let it , if it not too big a risk . They will come back when the chips are down or the guns are up ! And you have so much left ! " She inhaled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But . Do you want to keep your prosperity , your cars , your shoes , your good food , eh ? Then you must have your empire to support your prosperity . And as long as you have your empire you will have your wars on the frontiers , just like the Romans and the Turks and the British . You settle this one and soon you will have another one , in Berlin , or in Greece , or somplace else in Asia . " Clement was almost visibly shaking with pleasure . " I think that 's the best thumbnail exposure of the capitalist exploitationof the underdeveloped world I 've heard . " " Oh , bullshit , " said Norma . " You do n't think I 'm a Communist , do you ! They are worse . Their empire is caught in a trap , and it is poor besides ! It is worse . I am no politics . I am a realist . I see the truth . I tell it . America is not fighting for freedom in Asia . America is fighting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ masses of the world from exploitation . Russia is fighting for Russia . The people who run countries , whether they say they are kings or Democrats or Communists , want power for themselves and propserity for their own peopleand to hell with everybody else . " " You 're very cynical , " said Ginnie sagely . Norma stared at her , and then leaned across and patted her cheek warmly . " You are pretty . Be pretty . Be innocent . The boys will love you more . I am older . Two divorces . Some love affairs . I live everyplace in the world . Do n't listen to me.  |p124Dance  . Be pretty . " She drew slowly on her cigarette . " Ach , I am sorry . I talk like a maniac . My head explode sometimes . I am so so sorry . I am sorry . Gordon , darling , forgive Norma . I am so so sorry , to make serious your happy afternoon of American football . Will you forgive me ? " Hugely relieved that the volcano was quiescent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large gulp of Scotch , and then shepherded his group toward the door . Standing before the fire Ginnie said to Norma politely , " It was very educational to meet you . " " Oh my God ! " cried Norma . " I am so old now I become an education , an institution . Oh my God . Life is finished . " She grasped Ginnie 's shoulder . " Be pretty . Do n't think too much , not yet . What do you do here , what do you study ? I was talking to that woman before and did n't hear what you said . You have an interesting face , wide . Are you studying to be an actress ? " " Yes , " said Ginnie faintly . " Interesting . You may have possibilities . " " Are you  --  an actress ? " " Me ? No , no , never . I said before , I am a photographer . However , I have this voice and I was doing much dubbing in Hollywood . My French is like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some big stars when they dub their films for France . Very interesting work . You find out their speech problems , what 's wrong with their acting , how they fake when they do n't understand an emotion , hesitate or speed up or whatever . Me , I understand all the emotions but I have to speak like them to match their lip movements . Frustrating ! " Lou was standing beside her . During a bit of conversation between Ginnie and Mrs. Stoetzer she said swiftly out of the side of her mouth to him , " Take me away from here . " " They were charming , charming , " Norma said as she drove her car forcefully toward the center of New Haven . " But I had to leave . I get very nervous at the scene of one of myp125crimes , like attacking poor darling Gordon . I want fresh air after that ! " Clement , shivering in the back seat , said swiftly , " You 're getting plenty of that now . " " Ha ! It 's good for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it  --  " " Please ! " exclaimed Lou . " Do n't get him on that ! " " What do we do now ? " asked Norma . " Straight ahead , you 're doing fine , " answered Lou . " Is this the best route there ? " inquired Clement , probing for Lou 's plans again . " Yes . " " How do you spell the name of this place ? " persisted Clementdrily . " I 've always wondered . " " S-m-i-t-h-s , " replied Lou immediately . " What do you two talk about ? Where do we go ? " said Norma . " I want to see the naive American college boys , how they play . Where is all the confusion ? " Lou glanced back at Clement . " Fraternity Circle " " You hate where you take me now , " said Norma. . yes . " " No , " said Lou . " It 's fun in a way if you do n't think about yourself or anything , is n't it , Clem ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of death . " Like all big student partying at American universities , the spirit along Fraternity Row that night was beer-cellar Germanic . An ocean of beer flowed beneath and around and sometimes over everything , bad unison singing croaked in the air , in the glare and haze of smoky basement bars reddish faces beheld each other , male backs and female behinds were slapped , stairs were fallen down , glasses were hurled through windows , a mish-mash mingling , purposelessly hilarious , engulfedeveryone . " Incredible , " said Norma as they entered the stone cavern , oak tables strewn about the stone floors , students and their girls sitting around and on the tables , gray smoke , spilled beer . " It 's like a Greek taverna at four o'clock in the morning.  |p126They  are too far ahead of us . We never catch up . " But they did . Clement rid himself of his cape-coat and deerstalker hat , removed Norma 's mink ( " Paris Match Magazine , not Durant , got me that ! " ) and Lou 's long black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large room upstairs with deep couches and a fireplace , settled them in a couch in a dark corner out of the tide of moving bodies , procured three powerful martinis from the bar in an upper alcove , and encouragedthem to drink . " If only they had ouzo , " sighed Norma regretfully . " What 's ouzo ? " inquired Lou . " Do n't ask , " she answered , and suddenly kissed him not on but near the mouth . Long and lithe and blond , older and more magnetic , Norma in her silver blouse and ivory-colored slacks had already attracted attention ; this display of affection for Louis Colfax , a spooky non-member of the fraternity , hurtled him to sudden prestige . Lou took a swallow of his martini and , added to the drinkingat the Stoetzers ' , he was suddenly released . He did not drink every often ( " Colfaxes dominate the alcoholic wards in our part of Connecticut " ) but when he did , a certain precise amount would open the gates of his personality wide . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mouth . " I just wanted to do that all day , " he said in a bubbling , grinning way . " You do n't mind , do you ? " " Mind affection ? Me ? " " I did n't think you would mind . " On seeing this , a flash of consternation had shot through the students milling near them . They studiously looked away from Louis Colfax , the show-off . Lou was totally unaware of them . But gradually several lone students and several couples sidled up , drawn by this blond woman with so much vitality visible in all her gestures and glances , and Norma yelled something friendly to each of them , and a vivacious circle formed around her , Lou and Clement . Norma was creating cheerfulness ( " I do penance for making this afternoon so serious ! " ) . Suddenly Gordon loomed behind the circle formed in frontp127of Norma 's couch , staring down . " Darling  --  " she began ; he did n't hear her , did n't move . He seemed to begin following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ student about which cultures considered it polite to belch . In the middle of the discussion Gordon suddenly belched , enormously . Norma 's eyes flashed to him , then she said to Lou , " He is drunk ! He can not drink . He becomes insane . And he is drunk . " Gordon seemed to be again following the discussionwith interest . " He looks okay to me , " answered Lou . " He is out of his mind . We must do something . What shall we do ? " Myron and Vilma Stoetzer , the most unobtrusive and tolerantchaperons the Yale community afforded , were making their way across the pulsating room toward Norma 's circle . When they reached it , Gordon turned at them and roared , " Well ! Myron One-Play , hi there ! " Myron Stoetzer stood still , arms hanging down . Mrs. Stoetzer said , " Gordon , what do you think you 're saying ! " Gordon 's light blue eyes behind their horned-rimmed glasses had a messianic light beaming from them ; his broad , ruddy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to know one to tell one ! " he roared . " Look at her ! The prophetess ! I brought her here . Zuleika Dobson ! Lenin in his sealed train . You have to know one to tell one ! One , right ? One teenyweenyplay , right ! The Colors of the Rainbow , right ! " " Myron , " intoned Mrs. Stoetzer . " I think the campus po-lice- " " Uh-oh , " cried Gordon . " Gotcha ! Gotchal Bye-bye ! " he yelled at them " Bye-bye ! " and with a sort of prancing step disappeared into the crowd in the direction of the front door . " Go and get him , " Norma said to Lou . " Me ? He wo n't even listen to me when he 's sober ! " " True . Well , well , what to do ? " Then she giggled . " It was Bismarck who said the Lord takes care of drunks and Americansand so Gordon is both and so , may the Lord take care of him . Am I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not go with him ? " " You think you 'd be able to control him ? "  | " Nobody can control a drunk Durant . " " Well then let 's enjoy ourselves here . " " All right . If you think it is right . " " I think it 's completely right , myself . " " So do I , " she then said confidently . Turning to the nearest student she asked , " Is Yale healthy for sex ? This evening , all this drinking and noise , seems a substitute for sex . Am I right or wrong ? " At that , the shouted discussion leapt energetically forward . Somehow in the tumult Mrs. Stoetzer edged herself onto the couch next to Lou , who was now pinned between her and Norma . Myron Stoetzer hung , a rather static figure , on the outskirts of the group , glancing suddenly and seemingly at random here and there , toward the ceiling , then the floor , then a window , then the bar . " It was vicious of Gordon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavy , was saying rapidly and hoarsely into Lou 's ear . " He does n't know what it is , to do it again . Not unable to write another major play , unable to write any second play at all , even to finish one more . It 's like living in a vacuum after breathing champagne air once upon a time . Myron ca n't breathe . I keep him alive by artificial respiration . A gift for art or for anything is a horrible curse when it 's taken away . And it can go at any time , out the window one fine morning , gone like a bird , flown away , unrecapturable . And the derelict being it leaves behind ! " she sighed heavily into Lou 's ear . " Is a gift so great to have ? " he said . " What ? " " Is it so . . . rare , having a talent like that , does it matter so much , is it so precious ? " " Do n't you think so ? " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Mrs. Stoetzer steadily , " you 'd better think about it . " Some time later in the evening he spotted Ginnie across the room . Mrs. Stoetzer had moved off and was now talking intensely into her husband 's ear . Norma was standing in frontp129of the huge fireplace holding mesmerized seven undergraduates . Clement was leaning on the bar in the alcove , telling the Negro bartender about the battle for the rights of the " MemphisFive . " Lou , drunk , made his way across to Ginnie . " Charlotte tried to wreck me , " he began , glaring at her . " No she did n't . " Ginnie was not phased by his abruptness . " How did she ? " " Left a picture of the kid in the cabin in the woods where we used to shac  --  to live . " Lou could not use or even think crude language ( " shack up " ) in relation to himself and Charlotte , not even now when it was finished and he was sure he hated her . " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but I could n't have him . That producer 's got him . I 'm just some little sophomore , some nobody , I do n't count . . . to hell with you , that 's what she was saying . She did n't take my money or anything if I had any or my Morgan or anything or my birth certificate or uh anything like that or my citizenship away . . . she just took my son because uh I guess I 'm not supposed to be up to having one . . . Lou Colfax , sophomore , you know , too callow or something like that to be the father of a child of the great Charlotte Mills , actress , balls , she 'll never get anywhere as an actress unless that producer sinks all his money in it and then it 'll be a flop because she has not ... got a gift , she is not gifted , she has a knack and a little talent maybe but no endowment , she is not endowed . . . even Yale is endowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to get anywhere except in some vanity production using all that producer 's pull and all his money BUT . . . in the meantime I am not the one , me , Lou Colfax , sophomore , to be recognized and certifiedas the father of her kid because you know I just do n't have enough weight or something in the community or standingor whatever you call it , I 'm too callow and I guess crazy and who am I ? That 's the question , or her question , or mine or somebody 's ... " Hours passed ; the fraternity emptied ; the campus quieted ; Lou , Clement , and Norma , sobered up , were delving conversationallyinto Korea and the " Memphis Five " and sex andp130religion , and failed to notice that they were virtually alone . Norma suddenly said , " My head is splitting . I need a pill . " " We did n't give you any dinner ! " Lou exclaimed . " I forgot ! " " Never mind , darling . No food . Just a pill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lou 's room in Pierson College was only a dozen yards away , but forbidden to women at this hour , with a campus policeman at the gate to enforce the regulation . " My room . . . " murmured Lou . " Yes , " said Clement steadily . " Forbidden . . . " " Yes . " " Just over the back wall here . " " Ummm . " " Norma , " said Lou , " what kind of shape are you in ? " " Shape ? You mean my figure  --  " " I mean physical condition . Can you climb over a high wall and a piked fence and a moat ? " " Of course , " she said immediately with a proud frown . " I am an athlete . " " Then let 's go . " They went downstairs , out the door into the backyard of the fraternity , and by piling furniture against the wall and with help from two stray students , Lou , Clement , and Norma found themselves on top of the wall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point opposite Lou 's bedroom window . Now all that was required was to climb over the high piked fence , step across the moat , which had narrowed here into a mere symbolic obstacle , and enter his window . " Any good cat burglar could do it , " whispered Lou encouragingly . He hoped not to awaken the students in the surroundingrooms ; one moat adventure seen by everyone was more than enough . Norma was all agility , leverage , and determination . She was the first over the picked fence , and guided Clement over it . " No , do n't put your foot there , or else you destroy your crotch forever on that iron point . Careful ! Swing your derriere over ,  |p131careful  ! There . Slow , slow , slide the left foot down , slow till you touch  --  there ! Now  --  " They moved one at a time into the darkened bedroom and on through to the brightly lighted living room . " Here we are ! " said Lou enthusiastically , rubbing his hands together . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course , some aspirin . " " You know , " said Norma slowly , " my headache is disappeared . Prop open the front door , so we get some air in here . It did not need aspirin , but only to get out of that place and I needed a challenge , the wall , the fence , the iron points , the moat  --  Yale is a crazy house , no ? That is why the patients are locked in like this ? " Clement replied , " Mother Yale in her wisdom has seen fit to lock the unwashed masses out , not so much the students in . It 's like the old International Settlement in Shanghai . Reservedfor the exploiters . " Norma swung around to Lou for his rejoinder . She instinctivelycreated debates . " Do you think that 's it ? " began Lou thoughtfully . He was truly undecided about most things . He saw many sides of most questions . He was that hesitant youth with something precious inside himself which he felt so valuable that he proceeded with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quality in him , which he had always been ashamed of , this hesitancy and seeing so many sides to a question , praising of all things his indecisiveness , made him more conscious of it and play it up just a shade . For the first time in his life he saw that one of his innumerabledefects was not a defect at all no matter what the Marine Corps thought . He saw that it was potentially valuable , appropriate , useful , right . He wanted to throw his arms around Norma . He did throw his arms around Norma . Shoot himself ! He felt deliriously happy . They sat down , found some of Gordon 's Scotch , and began having a nightcap . Soon Clement would go , and perhaps Norma would stay . . . In the middle of their conversation a clattering sound ech/oed from the courtyard outside , a cutter-clatter re-echoed from the Georgian walls of Pierson College . " That sounds like  --  " Lou began , chuckling in disbelief , " you 'd almost think that was a horse coming down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ? " agreed Norma ominously . The clatter grew swiftly louder , came to a nervous tattoo just outside the door , and then with a neigh Gordon Durant 's polo pony pranced through the door into the room , with Gordon flattened along its shoulder and neck . Halting in the center of the Moroccan carpet in front of the fireplace , with the other three people falling back into the corners , Gordon sat upright , his head just grazing the ceiling , holding the reins carefully , just in front of his waist , sitting the English saddle properly , his toes in the stirrups , heels down , riding crop unobtrusively in his left hand , and gazing through the windowsat the end of the room he said in a puzzled way , " Damn those drivers . Why ca n't they put on their dimmers ! Practicallyblinded me . " He stroked the mane of the animal , who twitched and tossed his head up suddenly . Norma screamed faintly , and then gesturing with her hand at them she began shakily , " Gordon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nostrils he rolled his eyes toward Norma and began rapidly side-stepping in that direction . Gordon lurched in the other direction , but after hanging sideways momentarily , recovered his position . " Ho , Thor , ho , " commanded Gordon , patting him on the neck . " Ho , boy , ho ! " Thor stood very still again . " Never gets any goddamn exercise  --  " Gordon ruminated , " damn stable people  --  " " Tell me , " began Clement in his most rational , urbane tone , " would n't this work , Gordon ? I take the  --  whatever you call it  --  bridle , and sort of lead Thor around in a half-circle and you can go back through the door and  --  " " Give him more exercise ! " finished Norma shrilly . " Why do n't you get off , dismount , " said Lou , managing to keep most of his mad hilarity out of his voice , " so it 'll be easier getting Thor through the door . " " Got the best seat at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Gordon ! " all three shouted almost in unison . The horse settled into this new position and Gordon very slowly swiveled his head from face to face to face , and then back again . " What are all of you doing in my room ? " he then asked . " Gordon , you are riding on a horse  --  " Norma began desperately . Just then Thor lifted his tail and dropped a large stool on the Moroccan carpet . Norma screamed . Thor lurched sideways again . Gordon lost his balance and very slowly regained it . " Listen , " Lou began . " I 'll take the bridle and Clem , be ready in case Gordon falls off . " " He 's going to fall off , " said Norma . " All right , " said Clement stiffly . Lou approached the horse in front and reached for the bridle . Thor tossed his head but Lou 's movement was swift and he had hold of the bridle . Thor instinctively asserted his remaining freedom and began stomping and kicking with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , looking bored and half-asleep , still sat the horse . Lou began slowly to turn Thor in the direction of the door . Norma said , " Gordon will hit his head on the door ! " " I know , " said Lou . " Clem , pull him off . " Clement stepped forward , put his arms around Gordon 's waist , and slowly pulled him off the horse . Thor suddenly caromed his hindquarters away from Clement and knocked over a table , two lamps , and a bookcase . A picture crashed to the floor . One of the lamps broke a window . Gordon had been eased off the horse , Clement had him beneath the shoulders , Gordon 's legs were on the floor and he might be trampled at any instant . Lou plunged toward the door and Thor , now thoroughly frightened , accepted this lead and bolted out of the room . Once through the door Lou released him and Thor set off in a calmer canter to explore Pierson Courtyard . Glancing back in at the wreckage , seeing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd better get thep134horse ! " and set uncertainly off into the courtyard . " Louis Colfax ! " cried Norma . " Do you know about horses ? " " Not exactly . " Students in surrounding rooms must be either away for the weekend or very drunk , reflected Lou as he made his way up the silent courtyard . If somebody wakes up they 'll think it 's me making a Colfax of myself again instead of Gordon . But that suddenly did n't matter , because he had something valuableinside him and  --  and people who were afraid to make fools of themselves never made anything of themselves ! And that insight was not Norma 's ; that was his . Thor was at the far end of the courtyard , near the French doors leading to the Common Room and the Dining Room . Staying in the grass to be as soundless as possible , Lou approached . Thor was nibbling shrubbery . " Is it good ? " said Lou softly . " It 's good , is it ? Good , hmm ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Lou quietly , coming alongside Thor and , leaning forward , he nibbled at a leaf himself . Thor paused in his chewing briefly and then continued . Lou reached over and patted him softly on the shoulder , and then began stroking his mane with his right hand while with his left hand he took hold of the bridle . Since Thor did n't protest Lou then put his left foot in the stirrup and in one rather shaky motion swung onto the saddle , found the other stirrup and put his foot in it . The horse felt like a great barrel of tense muscle between his legs . Thor appeared to be in an indecisivemood ; his ears rose and fell several times and he tossed his head . Norma approached from the right . " You are on him , " she said guardedly . " At the moment , yes , I am on him . " " What are you going to do ? " she asked in the same low , guarded voice . " Take him home , I guess . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where we saw the football . You remember ? We drove past them in my car . " " I think I know where they are . "  | " You know how to ride ? " " I . . . do n't know . I 've ridden a few times , at fairs andplaces , you know , little ponies that go around in circles . " " Thor is a thoroughbred , and Gordon says he is reallyhigh-spirited . Gordon likes them very high-spirited . " " He does , does he ? " " Yes . " " Well , " said Lou as cheerfully as he could , " here goes ! " and he turned Thor toward the underpass leading to the long stone walk and on to York Street . Seeing this unobstructed avenue before him Thor lurched into a jouncing canter . Lou did not fall off . Down the long walkway they clattered and out into York Street . There was no traffic at this hour . Thor seemed calmer and they went ahead at a trot , which Lou found much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Chapel . The traffic light there was still operating . " Do I stop for it or what ? " Lou asked himself ; but Thor in effect answered by trotting proudly through it . Lou managed to turn the horse into Chapel Street headed out of town in the direction of the Bowl and the stables . Each time , after Lou had turned the horse , Thor would glance beadily back at him . What is he thinking ? Lou asked himself . What 's going on in that strange long head ? I 'm much fonder of animals than Gordon ever was . I 've got seventeen cats . The horse suddenly sprang into a canter . " Whoa , now , now , Thor , easy , take it easy , ah pull up , pull up now Thor Thor THOR 000000000h , wow , yes , now , now , that 's that 's better , easy , take it easy , do n't keep looking back at me that way . No , do n't start eating that tree , people live there and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we 've got a long way to go . That 's better , now just do that walking and do n't go into that trot because that 's rough , that really is . . . Thor , Thor , listen to me . There 's a bus coming toward us down the street . Do you see it , Thor , that bus coming toward us . We 're going all the way over here on the far side of the street and we 're going to pass calmly . " The bus moved up to them and the driver and one lonep136passenger gaped at Lou and Thor . Somehow emboldened by this , Lou gave a single encouraging noise out of the side of his mouth to Thor as he had heard cowboys in movies give to Old Paint and , instantly galvanized , Thor plunged forward through several gaits with amazing speed and threw himself into a full , flat-out gallop . At an intersection , desperately swinging , Lou turned Thor off Chapel Street and its traffic hazards and at the next intersection , desperately swinging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chapel and headed out of town . He had not fallen off , although he had lost the stirrups . However , he had long legs ; Thor was a powerful but not a large animal , and Lou was able to get a good grip around his middle with his legs . As they pounded down the empty street Lou was not so petrified that he had n't a corner of his mind free to see himself as Paul Revere rousing the town , as the Headless Horseman , as the Pony Express . Galloping was oddly easier than any of Thor 's other gaits , easier to stay on , provided Thor did n't trip . They tore along the street . Then Lou began to realize that he was having an absolutely fantastic ride . The moon , huge at harvest time , was sliding slyly in and out of cloud banks , the autumnal trees were still and burly with leaves as he rode through the smell of them , the clarity and emptiness of very late at night exhilarated him , the coordinate bunch and stretch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear clit-clat of Thor 's indestructible hooves . The horse was happy too , Lou sensed it for certain , and with that certainty fixed in his mind Lou 's fears evaporated . They hurtled on together . They came to a crossroads and Lou suddenly realized that this street ended here , a park lay dead ahead and Thor plunged gleefully into it . Now began cross-country riding . This was different . Thor began to plunge down embankments , hurtle past lowbranchedtrees , swerving in and out through what seemed a crazily disordered orchard , leaping a ditch here and there . Lou now abandoned the reins and threw his arms around Thor 's long , pumping neck . Thor did not seem to want top137throw him off exactly , but only to enjoy the thrill of the park . Lou was welcome to share this pleasure if he wished , and could . Some water lay ahead and Thor pulled up abruptly , trotted up to the bank , stopped , and began to drink . It would now be possible for Lou to dismount safely , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been to Gordon 's horse more than fulfilled . He could call the police about Thor or something . But he had n't the faintest intention of doing any such thing . He regained the reins , found and put his feet in the stirrups , and waited for Thor to finish drinking . The horse was calmer now and seemed ready to be directed . The trouble was that Lou had n't any idea where they were . Like most Yale students , he had a conception of New Haven consisting of East Rock and West Rock at the extremities , the Yale Bowl in the middle distance , the New Haven Green , the Shubert Theater and the Taft Hotel at the center with an aureole of restaurants and bars surrounding them . All else was unknown . A macadam road curved through the park and Lou headed Thor along it . He felt the horse now respected him and was willing to be guided . This road led to a large street which Lou recognized as close to the Stoetzers ' house . They would help ; they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Stoetzers faster than a student in a jam ; surely a rank amateur rider lost on an overspirited polo pony at four o'clock in the morning qualified . " Thor , " Lou began , " we 're going to visit some friends of mine . They 're crazy about animals too . They will want to be your friend too . THOR ! Do n't lift up your front legs like that my God I almost fell off and then where would you be ? Easy take it easy . Oh you want to trot well all right though I like walking or even . . . canter ? you feel like cantering you are n't too tired after all are you all right uhhhhh ! You 're not tired at all ! Those sudden swerves you ought to tell me about those swerves , hell , stirrups gone again here 's where I get you in a leg lock again , okay ? " They were coming up fast to the Stoetzer driveway . Loup138desperately leaned and Thor plunged into the gravel area in front of the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like a circus horse . A light went on in an upstairs window , and both Stoetzers appeared at it . .. Canadian mountie ? " Lou heard Mrs. Stoetzer suggesting. ... nightriders , here ? " Mr. Stoetzer could be heard rumbling . " Mr. Stoetzer , ha , it 's me , Lou Colfax , and ah Thor ! I 'm well kind of lost , it all looks so different at night out here , or I mean this early in the morning and I ca n't find the stable for Gordon 's horse ! " " Gordon 's horse ! " Mr. Stoetzer chortled . " I 'll come down  --  " Thor was gallivanting back and forth proudly over the driveway and lawn . " Can you hold him ? " " I might . I might . " He patted Thor 's neck , which was warm with sweat . Somewhere in his sponge-like memory he remembered reading something  --  an article in the sports section of the Hartford Courant , as a matter of fact , it was six , no seven years ago  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be stabled while sweating . Lou would have to somehow force Thor to walk the rest of the way to the stables to cool off . The front door opened , and the Stoetzers , in incongruously old-fashioned looking night robes for such an up-to-date pair , stood rather limply in the hall light pouring past them . Lou realized they had both had a lot to drink during the preceding evening and had been sleeping it off when he had awakened them with his ridiculous predicament . Mrs. Stoetzer inquired , " Does he want a drink of water or anything ? " and Lou suddenly loved her for being so good-humoredwith him . " I do n't think they 're supposed to drink when you have them out , " answered Lou , " but I 'd like something . " " A stirrup cup of brandy ? " inquired Mr. Stoetzer jovially . " Or just a good canteen of hootch for the trail ? " He must be still drunk to be talking that way , thought Lou.  | " I 'm afraid to drink anything like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't have too much control up here the way it is . " " I can see you do n't . Should n't I call up someone to bring a van for it ? That looks risky to me . " " No , we 're friends , Thor and me , even if he kind of forgets it once in a while . Just show me which road I take to get to the stables . " Mr. Stoetzer explained . " Why do n't you get down and lead him to the stables ? " suggested Mrs. Stoetzer . That struck Lou as a good idea , since that way the horse could cool off . He dismounted . Thor stood still . Mr. Stoetzer disappeared very briefly and returned with a bottle of Scotch and an elegant silver goblet . " Your stirrup cup , Nightrider . Quaff ! " Lou quaffed . Then he set out . " Tally ho ! " cried Mrs. Stoetzer . " View halloo ! " added Mr. Stoetzer . In an undertone she said , " Mad as a hatter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the middle of the night . " " Risking Gordon 's horse . That 's a valuable horse . " She gatheredher robe around her . " And risking his own neck . " " Oh well . " Mrs. Stoetzer delicately shrugged . Following Mr. Stoetzer 's direction Lou and Thor were soon amid the huge expanses of the athletic fields around the Bowl . Here the moist grass smells , added to the effect of the stirrup cup , plunged Louis Colfax into the heart of paradise . He had never been happier in his life , and no one else had ever been happier than he was now . " Thor , I 'm going to ask Gordon to sell you to me . " Thor continued walking . " Do you have a son , Thor ? " Thor walked on . At the stables the door was ajar as Gordon had left it , and inside in the darkness there was the sound of two or three horses breathing and pawing . Thor 's stall had been left open.  |p140The  sole remaining problem of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lou felt sure that Thor would not back in , would not go in at all unless Lou led him in head first . Once in the stall he and Thor would be at rather close quarters . Lou would have to get by him and out of the stall , and if Thor became unruly during that maneuver he might kick Lou around quite a bit . They stood in front of the stall . Lou looked at Thor , felt his neck . He was cooler now . Thor gazed over Lou 's head at the stall , waiting . " Let 's go , " said Lou quietly , and entered the stall , leading Thor . Then letting go of the reins , Lou moved along the side of the horse , patting him gently , gained the door , stepped outside , and swung it shut . There was room for Thor to turn around in the stall and he did so , put his head over the half-door and seemed to want to nuzzle him , or maybe that was just Lou 's imagination . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got back to his rooms in the Slave Quarters . The freshest of morning lights poured all around him , the shrubbery was etched in sunlight , the windows shone , and Lou 's own large hand , which he brought up in front of his face , seemed charged with life , like Michelangelo 's portrayal of God the Father 's hand reaching out to transmit life into Adam 's . Lou felt dizzy at the significance of this quality of light . He was dazzled by its overwhelming freshness and clarity ; it seemed inexpressibly beautiful to him ; he wanted to yell something and nearly did  --  screw everybody if they did n't like it  --  but then remembered his performance at the bottom of the moat , and although that humiliation had dwindled far and fast , he decided against waking Pierson College up at dawn . Instead he proceeded slowly along the flagstone walk past the red-brick facade with its green shutters alight with morning light ; charged with every meaning those shutters were , as was each blade of grass , each flagstone , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the court , near hisp141rooms . It was the most eternally heavenly tree in theWhat the hell was all this ? Raving over an ordinary tree at dawn . He must really be going crazy at last . But he could n't help this tidal wave of feeling occasioned by the fresh wash of morning light over Pierson Courtyard . It was  --  it was , there was something  --  it was  --  birth . This morning light evoked profoundly in him a sense of the miracle of birth . So that was it . Head down , he walked on into his room . Gordon Durant was asleep fully clothed , with a blanket over him , a pillow under his head , in the middle of the wreckage of the living room . Norma and Clement had departed . On the mantlepiece was a note in Norma 's big , excitable handwriting . DarlingGordon is too much of a stone to move . You are a hero . NormaLou almost wanted to cry . Probably it was just because he was so tired . He was n't ready to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tomorrow , and next week ? After new impressions had crowded in on her , other people , changed emotions , a different perspective on this night , secondthoughts , reconsiderations ? Love and admiration and friendship were so unstable , unrealiable , shifting , untrustworthy : they were Charlotte Mills . He hated that name . He hated all feminine forms of essentiallymasculine names  --  Charlotte for Charles , Francine for Francis , Louise for his own , Micheline , Joanna , Pauline , Georgette . Bellaughf ! ugly , all of them , and the ugliest of all was Charlotte . He was now very depressed , and knew that he would never sleep . He remembered some pills he had for that , but also remembered that he had used them up . Gordon Durant , human log , would not have any sleeping pills anywhere . So Lou sat in a corner and watched Gordon snore away the early morning . Around ten o'clock  --  Lou must after all have dozed off inp142his chair  --  Gordon began restlessly rolling and after a few minutes opened his eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ position on the floor in the middle of it , and slowly his gaze came to rest on Lou in the corner . " Where , " he croaked , cleared his throat , and began again , " where can I find a registered nurse ? " Lou had to chuckle . Gordon was , of all things , comical at the core . Inside everyone in the world one sprite or another reigned : the gnome of gloom , the satyr of sex , the imp of mischief , the clown of comedy . Inside Gordon , of all people , pompous , self-important Gordon , sat with his bells and giggles , the eternal clown . " Gordon , " said Lou gravely , " you 're comical . " " Never mind that . Where can I find a registered nurse ? " " It 's Sunday morning . Half of them are in church , and the other half are in bed . " " Blind leading the blind . Where are my glasses ? " Lou found his glasses on the mantlepiece and handed them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in here ? What the hell kind of party did you have ! " " Do n't you remember anything ? " " I remember  --  I do n't  --  I , well , I remember my Goddamnedex-stepmother giving us her Greek temper act at the Stoetzers , and dinner at Mory 's , I remember that we had three Green Cups . " " Three ? " " Three Green Cups and , let 's see , did n't I see you at Zeta Psi ? " " You did . And also Norma . " " And then . . . but I do n't remember the wild party you threw in here , I can tell you that ! " " I did n't throw any party . You rode your horse in here . " Gordon had begun to struggle out of the blanket . He stopped . " I did what ? " " You rode your polo pony in here and he kicked over a few things . " " You 're a liar . "  | " I rode Thor back and put him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bridle and things on because I did n't know how to take them off . I stopped at the Stoetzers to ask the way to the stables . Call them up and check . " Gordon , on one knee , stared with massive vacantness at him . Then he said quietly , " Oh no . " These were the most genuinely felt words Lou had ever heard come out of Gordon . He said , " Yes , I 'm afraid so . He dropped a big pile of shit on the floor . I guess Norma and Clement cleaned it up , but that 's what that stain there is . " " Oh no . " He stared into space for a while . " Did I hurt Thor , ride him into anything ? " " He seems to be okay . I rode him all the way back and he was okay . " " You did ? " " It was a good ride . " " Was it ? " " Nice horse . " " Yeah . " He stared some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I . . . well , I guess you 're not too fond of me , why should you be ? " " I like everybody , in a way . " " You have n't got any reason to like me and if you ever would it 'd be a miracle . I 'm not too friendly , I do n't like anybody really , and I never expect anybody to like me . Usually they do n't , unless they knew me since the age of three or something . They 're impressed by me or , " he added swiftly , " my family 's money , and so I get elected to things like the vice-chairmanship of the News , but there 's no affection lost in it anywhere along the line . What I 'm trying to say is , I hope you 'll sort of excuse my attitude . The thing is , all I have is the way I impress people and so with you here , that did n't help , it made it , I  --  " " I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " What do you care . You 've got all those things you know about , oceanography , all your interests . You do n't need to worry . " " That 's very funny because ninety-nine percent of the timep144I  --  there 's this girl I used to know , English . She had a funny expression , have n't a hope ' . . . We have n't a hope of getting to the films on time ' or something like that . Most of the time , ninety-nine percent of it , I have n't a hope for myself . And you say I do n't need to worry . That 's funny . . . " Also , he wanted to add but did n't , I care tremendously about everybody 's attitude toward me , including beggars , horses , and dogs . A dirty look from anybody can set me back for days . " You 'll develop out of it , " Gordon was saying in a monotone . " I do n't frankly think there 's that much in me to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! My God , water ! " and standing up , he headed into the bathroom . Lou sat looking after him , blinking . It was Sunday morning . New Haven is a city of belfries , and in them are many bells , solemn or delicate or declarative or grave , which send their tones tolling across the quiescent city on Sunday mornings . They rolled over Pierson College now from here and there , sounding calm reminders to those who wanted to listen , and spreading out into the sky this echo of their worship to others for what they wanted of it , rolling by and dwindling and finally disappearing over the city , meaningless if those hearing wanted meaninglessness , speaking calmly of Sunday to others . Lou , one of the others , listened and felt calmer . " I love Yale , " he yelled to Gordon . There was a kind of scuffle in the bathroom and then Gordon stuck his dripping head out of the doorway . " What ? " " I love Yale , " repeated Lou very bravely . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that if he could forgive this inane , hopelessly irrelevant and bottomlessly unfashionable remark , as ill-timed as possible , from Lou Colfax now , he could forgive anything . Lou was looking brightly across the room at him , waiting . Gordon drew in his breath , and then said judiciously , " I 'm glad you do . My grandfather built it , " and withdrew into the bathroom , feeling that he had cemented that friendship for life . " I love Yale , " Lou went on aloud to himself . " You knowp145why I love it ? Because it keeps things , preserves them , not just the Gutenberg Bible and the first book printed in America , but it , I do n't know , keeps , well , geology , who else would ? eeoughf ! and it keeps the rules of German grammar and all the old poets . . . who else would keep Dryden ? I ask you , who else will keep T. S. Eliot in a hundred years  --  Four Quartets ? Brother . They take care of finished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ newest mathematics , they even have that cozy pornography collection in the library , and they have all the latest chemical formulas and all the ones that led up to it , that 's important , is n't it , to be able to find the answer not just to Where are we ? ' but How did we get here ? ' That 's very very important . Yale can answer that question . That 's why I love it . " Gordon was still taking an immensely long shower . The bells continued rolling their calm reminder across the roofs of the University , and Lou suddenly felt he had to answer . He put on a black necktie over his black shirt , a tweed sports jacket , the inevitable dark glasses . Where to go to church ? Battell Chapel was too much like the Congregationalservice at home . St. Thomas More , just across the street , had all the interminable tradition of Roman Catholicism behind it , and that appealed to Lou strongly on this Sunday morning , but unfortunately the building itself was a failed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Lou felt the need for aged stone and statues and incense and encrusted vestments , for " the works " ecclesiastically , so of course he went to the dark , thick-walled , portentious High Episcopal Church up the street , and got it . He followed closely as the venerable priest moved slowly through the solemn old rituals and felt calmed , calmed by the almost endless continuity these rituals represented ; perhaps some detail of the ceremony flowed back to the old gods , to Apollo and the speaking spring and the laurel tree . Outside the church Lou drifted down the street , past SaybrookCollege , through the Old Campus where freshmen were tossing footballs , where ladies in flowered hats were comingp146out of Battell Chapel , where the complex ferment of a Sunday in New Haven was rising , Sunday , no classes , unscheduled Sunday , when you had to be yourself , God help you , Sunday , that was why he had gone in search of religion , of God , or of Apollo , because it was unscheduled Sunday , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ following week Lou set out for downtownNew Haven to visit a settlement house . Clement Jonaz was working there part-time as a volunteer and Lou wanted to see what he was doing . On the way he passed the Shubert Theater and noticed the billboard announcing the next attraction  --  " EnRoute to Broadway " : THE BEES KNEESA Musical Comedy of the TwentiesHis eye lighted here and there  --  " Starring Nigel Newhard "  --  " Directed by Roy Rich "  --  " Book and Lyrics by Elizabeth Ross MacDonald "  --  names so well-known even Lou had heard of them . Then he noticed a special box below the title : " Introducing and Co-Starring Miss Charlotte Mills . " It was exactly like the time she had slapped him in the face . Clement was not at the settlement house , but Lou found him back in his rooms at the Graduate School . " Well , she 's here , " he said without preliminaries as he came into the room . " Who is ? Margaret Truman ? " " Charlotte Mills . "  |p148Lou  continued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the windows permanently concealed behind blackout curtains ( " I 'm besieged in this country " ) . A maroon North African lamp of beaten copper hung by a chain in one corner , faintly illuminating it , and at Clement 's desk in the other there was a fluorescent reading lamp . On a very low coffee table a red votive candle flickered in its glass holder . Used to the layout of furnishings in the room , Lou crossed without bumping into anything and sat down in the black butterfly chair across the desk from Clement . " Back for some extra work at the Drama School ? " Clementinquired with low-pitched dryness . " She could use it , if the last time I saw her  --  " " Back in the lead , of a Broadway play , that 's where she is . Playing the lead in a big Broadway musical . " " Well , as they say , marry a producer and anything  --  " " I 've got to do something . " " What ? " " I 've got to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've got to . " " Why do you ? Excuse me , Louis , what has she got to do with you any more ? You do n't even like the theater . " Lou stared at him . " She 's the mother of my son , and I 've got rights . . . rights . " " Rights ? To opening night seats or what ? You do n't know for certain that that 's your son and even if it was , she has all the legal rights to it . I 'll tell you what your rights are as far as Charlotte Mills starring in a play are concerned . You have a right to buy a seat and to sit in it and boo ! That 's it . " " I 've got a right to see her , and see him . " " You have a right to ask to see her and to see him , " Clement qualified . " Will you come with me ? " " Me ? Why ? " " You 're calmer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carried away , you know to start yelling at her or anything , if you came along , I do n't think . "  |p149They  went out of the Graduate School toward the Taft Hotel . It was November . An indecisive lowering gray sky meditatedover New Haven , and the first Canadian winds carelesslystripped the dead leaves from the trees and sent them skittering along the campus streets . They passed the back of the Sterling Memorial Library ; Lou noticed that it presented its habitual baffling aspect of an ill-planned citadel . To be continued , its foreshortened forms and pointless patterns seemed to say . But nothing more could or would be done with the Sterling Memorial Library except to tear it down some day and try again . They turned left at the corner and proceeded down Elm Street . Color was disappearing from New England with the last of the leaves , fading with the leaves into gutters and extinction , and the New England winter world of grays was assuming control , smoke grays , dull browns , black , periodicallybrightened by snowfalls which , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Haven . Perhaps that was why the theatrical season came into full swing in November , bringing all the artificial dazzle of costumes , the glittering illusion of stage sets , the other-world evocativeness of stage lighting to the gray crowd huddled in the darkness of the playhouse . It was a northern predeliction , the theater , and perhaps this autumnal draining away of the surrounding color was a powerful impulse for it . Lou and Clement continued along through the November gloom in front of the Old Campus , and as Lou looked down across the New Haven Green with its three New England churches , the uncompromising assertion they made that solid down-to-earth Protestantism was here to stay , for good , that the mind and the body must be purified of their lusts and prurience , that " uprightness , " hard work , and a circumspect attitude toward the world were by divine law the only acceptableway to live , while on his right the University , society in microcosm , armed to the teeth , confronted the Green and everything else in New Haven , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best friend , where neitherp150one of them , for deeply different reasons , could feel any sense of identity with God on their left or Man on their right . Instead Lou proceeded between them on his own special straight-and-narrow path toward . . . toward the Taft Hotel , toward ' Charlotte Mills , toward this baby , whosoever he was . " She 'd better be polite to me , " he said evenly between set teeth . His straight brown hair was falling over his forehead above the big dark glasses , and despite them and the black raincoat , he retained an elusive air of grace , a fugitive distinction , as though his was a family of long-exiled and impoverishedaristocrats who had n't quite forgotten . " She 'd better be polite . If she tries to give me the old show-business brush-off I 'm going to do something drastic . " " I believe you brought me along to keep you calm . Keep calm . There , now I 've done my duty . Tell me when you need another booster shot . How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lou instantly . They went into Kaysey 's across from the hotel and Lou ordered a double vodka on the rocks . " Does n't smell , " he said . " Ca n't have her thinking I have to get drunk to face her . " He lit a cigarette . " I still think it would be a grand idea if you telephoned her . " " No . No advance warning . I want to see how she reacts spontaneously to suddenly seeing me . " " She knows she 's bound to see you here . New Haven ... " " Are you kidding ? She thinks I 'm still in the Marine Corps . " " Oh , " said Clement uneasily . Lou drained the double vodka rapidly , Clement sipped at a glass of beer , they paid and went across the street and into the gloomy marble rotunda of the hotel lobby . Lou put out his cigarette on the floor and lit another one . Then he sat down on a couch . Clement sat down beside him . " Are n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if she 's in ? " " Of course not . I told you . It has to be spontaneous " " Well then , " said Clement dryly , " why do n't you find out her room number and climb up the fire escape and come in through the window ? That would be enormously spontaneous for you both . "  | " That would n't surprise her , coming from me . " " I suppose not . " " Not from me . I wonder if her voice has changed . " Clement stared at the side of Lou 's exalted-looking face . " You know , acting , all this rehearsing and singing over and over all night long , they rehearse all night long in Broadway try-outs she told me , it can make your voice fall , drop an octave , or more , and , " Lou was now talking fast , rattling on in a machine-gun , mechanical way , " so she would sound very different . And then after all that rehearsing , she has to come back and sing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Does n't everybody have to sing lullabies to babies ? Must be a terrible strain , using her voice all that much . It 's a funny thing about Charlotte 's voice . She 's what you 'd call soft-spoken usually , you know in conversation and normal discussion and on the telephone , but uh her  --  she 's a ' belter , ' she told me she found out in her voice lessons , the teacher kept saying , sing louder , sing louder ' and it turned out that the soft-spoken little English rose had a voice like a drill instructor , Jesus , what made me think of drill instructors , D.I . ' s , Parris Island , eaougph ! Well , I found it out too , I never heard that voice she had except , well , the very last time I saw her , " Lou 's gaze shifted every few seconds back and forth between the elevators and the entrance to the lobby . " Then I heard it all right . Jesus . What a row . Brother . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in here , probablywith her husband and the director of the show and eight other people surrounding her , and find you babbling on to an Afro-Brazilian in the lobby ? " " Yes , " he replied . His eyes were on the arrow of the elevator . It was coming down . " Jesus she  --  when she 's really mad  --  and well I made her . . . well her voice well when I saw her the last time well she damn near blew the roof off the Black House that 's what happened the last time we saw each other  --  " Lou was waiting for Charlotte at the Black House . For the last five evenings he had telephoned her from the phone boothp152on the highway and she had said , Yes , she was coming for the night , and she had not come . For the last three mornings he had telephoned her from the highway for an explanation and it had always been the same : These people here have been auditioning us . . . play possibilities . . . a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these excuses  --  auditioning her at midnight !  --  Louwould be incapable of driving to New Haven for his own classes because what was the reason for doing anythingexcept in cooperation with his life with Charlotte , and if she was throwing these long shadows of doubt across their relationship then Lou saw no reason to function at all . And these shadows her nights of absence threw were not merely of doubt ; they had the blackness of certainty ; desperation had made him a master of detection . So Lou would return to the Black House and do the only thing in the world he could do in these circumstances . He set to designing underseas vehicles . And this did indeed take him out of himself , sever , very temporarily to be sure , the virtually umbilical connection with Charlotte and enable him to functionas an independent being . His inventiveness was independent , independent of Charlotte , independent even of his own nature . The vehicles , he called them names like Triton and Salamanderand Leviathan and Moby Dick and , for a particularly daring and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intricate and yet fundamentally simple design , it seemed to Lou , and they filled him with a kind of eerie happiness , eerie because it could live outside his feelings for Charlotte and himself . But finally this drug , if that was what it was , would wear off and Lou would turn to real ones . Pharmaceutics was one of his interests and in an informal way he had learned a good deal about this field . One way and another he had acquired a number of stimulants and depressants , sleeping pills and heart stimulators , inhalers and sprays , and he never took any of them according to the directions . Following directions seemed to him quite dangerous . So he would grind the pills to powder , take part of one and cross it with a bit of another , dilutep153the result with something , cross this mixture with another he had concocted after considerable study and experiment , and then swallow the result . He felt rather like Dr. Jekyll , but no Mr. Hyde emerged , exactly . Instead he put himself into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , and spacing them , he felt that no harm , and considerablebenefit , was being done . He was not " normal " ; that had been true of him from conception . He could not get through life as people with less tenuous nervous systems and complex brain cells did ; he had to improvise and find his own way empirically . He looked up from his chemistry table , hearing Charlotte drive up in the Morgan . Lou was only very slightly under the influence of a mixture of rum and a drug called Orbitol . He felt in complete control of himself and more self-possessed than usual . She strode across the neglected front of the house , across the little porch , and came in . She was wearing a tweed suit and looked much dressier than usual , looked older , with somethingnewly successful around the edges somewhere . Lou could n't locate it . The large , slender , oval earrings ? The competenthandbag hanging from her shoulder ? It was her hair . Her long , bright brown hair had been cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she said shortly . She did n't ask if he liked it ; he hated it . " What are you all dressed up for ? " Lou asked . She put the handbag on the oval table in the center of this shabby room . " Work , " she said . " Hmmm ? Work . These are your work clothes . " " Is there any coffee ? Louis , I 'd give anything to see you in some color , any color , besides black , if it 's clothes you want to talk about . " In all their limitless discussions she had never alluded to his addiction to black before . He was obscurely shocked . Black was a talisman for him , public acknowledgement of his specialidentity , it was like wearing the Miraculous Medal or the Star of David or the " Ruptured Duck " discharge emblem , a little apologetic , a little proud : this is me , take it or leave it . Itp154required a certain amount of courage : now Charlotte was disparaging it . " How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What ? " He put some water on the gas ring to boil for the coffee . " Are you sleeping all right these nights ? " he substituted . " Yes , why ? " " Sometimes you do n't . " " I 'm very tired at night . . . auditions ... " " Mmm . " " My , but this house looks neglected . " Lou spent several seconds studying the jet of flame under the water . Then he said , " This house is just like you and me . It used to be beautiful in its own peculiar way . And now it 's neglected . " Charlotte was sitting on the automobile seat next to the wall . In her city clothes she looked very uncomfortable and even uneasy there , as though she had not sat there countless times before . " Well , whose fault is that ? " she said after a silence . " If you do n't know whose fault it is  --  " " I have my work in New Haven . And also , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all that interested in me , interested in me , how shall I put it , " she finished with an attempt at a worldly laugh , " carnally . " Lou was making an absolutely microscopic study of the jets from the gas ring . " That 's true , " he said in his low-pitched voice , which was almost under control : thank God for rum and Orbitol . " So I would say , " she went on , " that the root of the neglect is there . Would n't you ? " The British query intonation of this question , so characteristic of her , had a kind of little-girl-sincere ring to it ; it nearly destroyed him there beside the gas ring . ( Inhale the gas ! Set fire to yourself ! ) How was it possible that someone so lovable could make him suffer so atrociously ? Suddenly he had to put an end to this atrocious suffering ,  |p155its  evil root had to be exposed , even if stating it devastated their relationship . " So I 'm neglecting you carnally , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ triumph of will and pharmaceutics . " Well , I never could enjoy leftovers . " She got up slowly from the seat . " What are you saying to me ! You . . . how dare you accuse me ! Leftovers ! You rat ! You  --  that 's the most  --  I  --  " She really is such a good actress , Lou noticed with infinite sadness , she really is . She had crossed to him and he had turned and faced her , a newly lighted cigarette hanging from his lips . " That 's what you suspect ! Spying on me ! Eavesdropping ! You insecure sneak . Imagining everybody 's betraying you , you 're so inadequate you have to imagine everybody 's betrayingyou ! " The room and the house were exploding around his head ; inside his head all was indescribable . He knew that she had a sexual relationship with that producer . It was not that , ultimately , which drove him to the point he now reached . It was that she even refused him the intimacy of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told . All purpose for him was now gone , all feelings bankrupt . He pulled the cigarette from his mouth and shoved it toward her left eye . At the last instant she turned her head and its burning tip ground into her cheek . The outcry. ... well her voice , well , the last time I saw her , well , I wonder about her voice , all this rehearsing , and they often rehearse all night . And then having to sing to the baby , those lullabies , everybody has to do that . " Lou lit another cigarette and fell silent . He watched the New Englanders purposefully cross and recross the lobby .
