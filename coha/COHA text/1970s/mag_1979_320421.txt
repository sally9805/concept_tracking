As new crackdowns proceed , dissidents try to link arms <P> Following a 15-month pause , the Soviets have resumed a crackdown on critics of the regime . In three centers of human rights agitation , Moscow , Kiev and Vilnius , KGB operatives over the past two weeks have arrested four prominent dissidents and searched the homes of several others . The moves mean a further thinning of Soviet dissident ranks already greatly diminished by the deportation of Alexander Solzhenitsyn and Andrei Amalrik in the mid-1970s and the trials and imprisonment of Yuri Orlov and Anatoli Shcharansky , among others , in 1978 . The movement 's sole internationally known survivor is Nobel Peace Prize winner Andrei Sakharov , who last week condemned the new arrests as " a calculated blow by the organs of repression . " <P> Western observers speculated that the arrests might mark an effort to silence the remaining dissident voices in the Soviet Union before the Olympic Games open in Moscow next July . Those seized represent several currents within the Soviet human rights movement . <P> &gt; Father Gleb Yakunin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who chafe under state control of church affairs . <P> &gt; Mathematician Tatiana Velikanova , 47 , another Muscovite , is a longtime champion of the persecuted Seventh-day Adventists , Crimean Tartars and Jewish " refuseniks " who have been denied per mission to emigrate abroad . <P> &gt; Music Teacher Mykola Gorbal , 38 , jailed in Kiev , has been active on be half of Ukrainian political prisoners . <P> &gt; Historian Antanas Terleckas , 51 , seized in Vilnius , the capital of Lithuania , is a Lithuanian nationalist and a Roman Catholic who had contributed to underground human rights journals . <P> Antidissident activity has also been heavy lately in other East bloc states , most notably Czechoslovakia . There , the particular target of Party Chief Gustav Husak 's secret police is the movement that has grown over the past three years around Charter 77 , a human rights manifesto signed by 1,000 people . Last month six Charter 77 organizers , among them Playwright Vaclav Havel , received sentences of up to five years for " subversion of the republic . " Since then more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questioning on various trumped-up charges , including attempts to blow up a Prague bridge and to assassinate Husak . <P> The arrests and trials in the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia have fostered a new spirit of unity among East bloc dissidents , who have launched a coordinated attempt to defend one another . <P> The groundwork was laid earlier this year at a Moscow meeting between Sakharov and a member of Poland 's major human rights organization , the Committee for Social Self-Defense ( KOR ) . After that , KOR publicly expressed solidarity with Soviet dissidents , and 15 Polish protesters staged a hunger strike on behalf of the Charter 77 organizers before their Prague trial . <P> Following the trial , Sakharov wrote an open letter to Charter 77 and KOR activists calling for the " unification of our struggle for human rights in Poland , Czechoslovakia and the Soviet Union .
