Part of the Nixon Administration 's hubris was a conviction that every federal agency , no matter how strong its tradition of independence , should snap to attention at a call to the service of the White House . That included the Internal Revenue Service , whose activity touches intimately the lives of almost all Americans . So John Dean told the Watergate committee last week , shredding the last vestige of the myth that Watergate was simply a matter of politicians doing things to other politicians . <P> Dean submitted a series of memos to back up his testimony that White House aides had tried ( and to the credit of the IRS , largely failed ) to get the IRS to use tax audits as a means of harassing liberal organizations , journalists , politicians , businessmen , labor leaders - the range of people perceived as " enemies " of the Administration . <P> One undated memo , prepared by Dean as a briefing paper for former Nixon Chief of Staff H.R. Haldeman , suggested that then IRS Commissioner Johnnie M. Walters be told that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Administration are a firm requirement and responsibility on his part . " The memo complained that Walters seemed no more willing to let the IRS be used for political purposes than had been his Nixon-appointed prede cessor , Randolph Thrower . <P> A second undated memo , which Dean said was another briefing paper for Haldeman but was prepared by for mer White House Aide John Caulfield , complained that Republican appointees at IRS " lack guts and effort " and " appear afraid and unwilling to do anything that could be politically helpful . " As a result , the document said , the White House staff was unable to crack down on tax-exempt foundations that " feed left-wing political causes , " to obtain information from the IRS " regarding our political enemies , " to " stimulate audits of persons who should be audited " or to place Nixon supporters in the IRS bureaucracy . A third memo , from Security Specialist Tom Charles Huston to Haldeman , suggested IRS audits to turn up information about " leftist organizations taking advantage of tax shelters . " <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dean , suggested that the IRS audit the tax return of Harold J. Gibbons , a Teamsters Union vice president in St. Louis , and identified him as " an all-out enemy , a McGovernite , ardently anti-Nixon . " Gibbons ' tax return for 1971 was later audited , and he said he had to pay a small additional tax on items involving travel expenses . Dean also testified that Caulfield succeeded in getting IRS to audit the 1970 tax return of Robert Greene , a Newsday editor who investigated the business dealings of Nixon friends Charles G. ( " Bebe " ) Rebozo and George Smathers . Greene said that the audit cost him $100 in accounting fees , but the review showed " I did not owe them a nickel . "
