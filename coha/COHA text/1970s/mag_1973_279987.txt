The scenes are straight out of the great grape strike of the late 1960s . In Southern California 's Coachella Valley , Chicano laborers again cry " Viva la Huelga " ( long live the strike ) at flashy sedans roaring through vineyard gates , and priests who join them are arrested for illegal picketing . Cesar Chavez again summons his workers to talk up a grape boycott . But this time , his opposition is not confined to the growers whom he signed to contracts three years ago . Now Chavez 's still tiny United Farm Workers Union ( 28,000 members at the end of 1972 ) is locked in a struggle with another union that happens to be one of the most powerful in the non-Communist world , the International Brotherhood of Teamsters . <P> When a group of three-year contracts that Chavez had negotiated expired on April 14 , only two Coachella Valley growers renewed them . Thirty others , who raise 85% of the valley 's table grapes , signed with the Teamsters , who have long represented drivers trucking grapes out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of laborers that the agreements " were n't contracts , they were marriage licenses . Tomorrow you will see the growers and the Teamsters skipping hand in hand into the fields on their honeymoon . " He called a strike that last week began spreading into Arizona and other areas of California , where Teamster organizers have also been at work . Violence has erupted as Chavez 's migrants face burly Teamster " protectors " of workers who cross the picket lines . The $750,000 packing shed of one grower who had signed with the Teamsters was burned to the ground , and a Teamster organizer has been charged with assault and battery for running U.F.W. strikers off a road with his car . <P> The odds against Chavez are long . If many more growers sign with the Teamsters , his union could be wiped out ; and most growers are eager to get rid of the U.F.W. at nearly any price . Many of those in the Coachella Valley signed Teamster contracts after only a single day of formal bargaining , during which , Chavez charges , no genuine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accepted a contract calling for a wage of $2.30 an hour this year , a bit less than the $2.40 that Chavez got for his followers , and also allowed growers to bring back the labor contractors who hand-pick groups of workers for a day 's labor . Chavez 's agreements had banned the contractors and set up union hiring halls at which growers chose their field hands . <P> This month Chavez will visit AFL-CIO headquarters to ask the labor federation 's support for a new nationwide grape boycott . It will be much harder to popularize , though , than the boycott that became a flaming liberal cause toward the end of the ' 60s . Chavez this time can not ask consumers to shun all grapes , only Teamster-picked ones , and shoppers have little way of telling which those are . Chavez has strong verbal support from the AFL-CIO , which booted the Teamsters out 15 years ago ; but as yet he has received no federation money - and his union has no strike fund .            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
