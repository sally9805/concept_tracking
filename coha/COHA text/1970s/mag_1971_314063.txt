Immediately after Maine Senator Edmund Muskie 's powerful mid-term election-eve television speech , Pollster Louis Harris set up a mythical presidential race between Muskie , President Nixon and George Wallace . The startling result was a Muskie victory , with 46% of the vote , compared with 40% for the President . Last week George Gallup announced the results of an almost identical sampling taken a month later . In this trial , Nixon squeaked by the Democratic front runner , 44% to 43% . Whether the difference is due to increased presidential popularity or to the vagaries of polltaking two years before the event is difficult to know . In any case , there can be scant comfort in the new survey for the White House , since Gallup , like Harris , found the undecided vote to be 4% , making Nixon 's 1% margin rather fragile .
