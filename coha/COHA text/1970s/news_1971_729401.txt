txt Despite expressions of alarm here over Soviet strategic - arms developments , the administration still is holding back from sharply increased strategic spending . According to present indications , the administration will wait somewhat longer to see how the **25;397;TOOLONG talks ( SALT ) with Moscow work out before moving along on any big , new , and expensive projects . Although Secretary of Defense Melvin R. Laird told reporters the other day that " we had to make tough decisions in the 1972 budget and we made them , " the United States is not yet fully committed to any new expenditures . Mr. Laird left the impression that the Pentagon is running full steam ahead on them  --  a tactic that may possibly spur Soviet interest in SALT agreements . In the 1972 budget , a decision was made to accelerate development work on the B-1 ( a new strategic bomber to replace the aging B-52 ) . Development of a new ballistic-missile submarine ( the ULMs ) was also speeded up . Expenditures for both will rise in fiscal 1973 , and even higher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ production decision " will not be made until fiscal 1973 and ' 74 . More project funds asked The Pentagon is asking $370 million in fiscal 1972 , beginning July 1 , for researchand-development work on the proposed new bomber , as compared with $75 million this year . That is a substantial increase . A total of $110 million is being sought for the new submarine , as compared with $45 million to be spent this year . Spending on the submarine has fluctuated . During the first spending year , fiscal 1969 , the Navy put about $100 million in the new sub . Neither plan is so far along now that the services are committed specifically . The bomber may change substantially . Senior defense officials have said privately that the bomber will be worked over thoroughly to avoid production problems and to simplify and save wherever possible before a production decision is made . Similarly , Pentagon sources say , the Navy and defense hierarchy still are not close to the final decision points on several important aspects of the new submarine . // *Soviet ABMs fail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the new systems , if apl proved , would not start entering the ' defense inventory until the late 1970's.gAnd each system would cost a sum presently uncertain , although spending would run in the billions . Types vs. models It might well turn out that any SALT agreements would limit the international weaponry to types rather than specific weapons . In such an event , the Pentagon may well want to go ahead with the new submarine and bomber to replace existing models , just as the Soviet Union may wish to upgrade within agreed-upon numbers limitations . It is clear , however , that the Pentagon is not moving ahead as fast as it might by any means A very deliberate pace is being maintained on the developmental programs for the new bomber and submarine , which remain seven or eight years hence . The Polaris submarine was produced much faster . Built when there was a concern a missile gap might develop , the Polaris took three years from inception until the first boat was deployed . To equal that , or to come close , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speed ahead , which it apparently does not now see , and it would need to be willing to take the risk of concurrent development and production , which speeds things ; but can lead to cost problems that could upset congressional tranquillity . Thus , the Penttgon has opted to give the impression it is rushing right along without having to seek funds of the mammoth proportions necessary if that were really so . Other moves hinted Mr. Laird has indicated he might make other moves soon if Soviet strategic developments seem to dictate something more in America 's arsenal . He mentioned the possibility of buying more Minuteman missiles as a fast solution . And he mentioned the possibility of getting more protection for the present land-based system . However , the secretary and his advisers are aware that there are definite problems here . Although it would be fairly easy to buy some more Minutemen , the Soviet SS-9 is seen by strategists as posing a strong long-range threat to the present Minutemen , as well as any that might be added . Bombers and land-based missiles now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ systems . Some hardening of missile sites is being done as earlier Minutemen sites are converted to hold the new Minuteman III , with its.multiwarheads . To do much more in the way of hardening would cost great sums of money . Many scientigts believe such expenditures might be only of short-term benefit . It is conceivable that the huge Soviet missiles , given greater accuracy , could knock out missile sites no matter how much they were hardened . Thus , if the Minutemen were to be further protected , it might be most logical to do so through beefing up the ABM network being built to protect them . No panic button yet The ABM , of course , is a very expensive proposition , even as presently envisioned . Congress might well balk at any strengthening unleS 's the Soviet threat were becoming undeniably clear . So far , Soviet strategic growth has not caused the administration to push the panic button for new and greater spending . But no one knows when that time may come . The Soviets now are expanding their strategic-missile system , building @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rate , and taking other steps to cause concern here . Mr. Laird . has argued before that the Soviets appear to be striving for a first-strike capability . Though some others are less certain , there is little doubt that the Soviets are building a nuclear inventory of astounding power and capability . But if Soviet development continues , clear-cut and broad understandings at SALT may be the only things that could save the U.S. from tremendous spending if it is to maintain not superiority , but parity .
