As the title implies , the book 's theme how one should live in order to die happy . The scene of e novel is , for the most part , the author 's birthplace , lgeria . In the first section , a young man , Patrice Mersault , portrayed as alienated from the possibility of happiness his poverty , his distractibility , his boredom . Through s mistress , Marthe , he makes the acquaintance of Ronald tgreu.s , an older man who had been the girl 's lover before accident crippled him for life . Zagreus befriends Merit ; he tells the younger man that he is made for happis , just as he ( Zagreus ) had been .

A last star dissolved slowly in the sky , and the pale road he could hear only the motor 's contented r.r and occasionally , in the distance , the sound of hooves , clatter of milk cans , until , out of the dark , his headts flashed on the shining iron of the horseshoes .

Mersault stepped on the gas . The sucking sound of the wheels grew louder on the dewy ement .

Mersault takes his money and travels to Eastern Europe . He is still tormented by an incapacity to control his perceptions of the world around him , and returns to Algiers . For a time he lives with friends in an idyllic villa high above the city . There he begins to find happiness , to be at one with the world ; he gives himself completely to sun and sky . But it is not enough . He buys his own house near a village on the coast , the Chenona , and goes there to live . And to die . sound of the motor gaining speed momentarily drowned out the soft voices of the sea rising from the beaches below . Only an airplane permits man a more apparent solitude than the kind he discovers in an automobile . Utterly confident of his own presence , satisfied with the precision of his gestures , Mcrsault could at the same time return to himself and to what concerned him . The day lay open , now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the sea . awakening the fields on either side of the road , still deserted a moment before , filling them with the red fluttering of birds and insects . Sometimes a farmer would cross one of these fields , and Mersault , rushing past , retained no more than the image of a figure with a sack bending over the moist . clinging soil . Again and again the car brought him to the edge of slopes overlooking the sea ; they grew steeper , and their outline , barely suggested in the light of dawn , grew more distinct now , suddenly revealing pros- " What mattered was to humble himself , to organize his heart to match the rhythm of the days instead of submitting their rhythm to the curve of human hopes . " A month before , Mersault had announced his departure to the House above the World . He would travel again , then settle down somewhere around Algiers . Several weeks later he was back , convinced that travel now meant an alien way of life to him : wandering seemed no more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inside himself he felt a dim exhaustion . He was eager to carry out his plan of buying a little house somewhere in the Chenoua , between the sea and the mountains , a few kilometers from the ruins of Tipasa . When he arrived in Algiers , he had envisioned the setting of his life . He had made a large investment in German pharmaceuticals , paid a broker to manage his holdings for him , and thereby justified his absences from Algiers and the independent life he was leading . The investment , moreover , was more or less profitable , and he made up for his occasional losses , offering without remorse this tribute to his profound freedom . The world is always satisfied , it turns out , with a countenance it can understand . Indolence and cowardice do the rest . Independence is earned by a few words of cheap confidence . Mersault then concerned himself with Lucienne 's fate . She had no family , lived alone , worked as a secretary for a coal company , ate little but fruit , and did Swedish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a word . To his questions , she replied : " Yes , I liked it , " or else : " It was a little sad . " The day he decided to leave Algiers , he suggested that she live with him but continue to keep her apartment in Algiers without working , joining him when he sent for her . He proposed this with enough conviction for Lueienne to find nothing humiliating in the offer , and in fact there was nothing humiliating in it . Lueienne often realized through her body what her mind could not understand ; she agreed . Mersault added : " If you want , I can marry you . But I do n't see the point . " " Whatever you prefer , " Lueienne said . A week later he married her and made ready to leave the city . Meanwhile Lueienne bought an orange canoe to skim over the blue sea .... N A LITTLE LESS THAN TWO HOURS , Mersault was in sight I of the Chenoua . The night 's last violet shadows still lingered on the slopes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the red and yellow sunlight . There was a kind of vigorous and massive assertion of the earth here , thrusting up from the Sahel and silhouetted on the horizon , ending in this enormous bestial back that plummeted straight down into the sea . The house Mersault had bought stood on the last slopes , a hundred yards from the wat ( already turning golden in the heat . There was only or story above the ground floor , and only one room in i but this room was enormous and overlooked the fro/ garden and the sea through a splendid bay window opera ing onto a terrace as well . Mersault hurried up to it : t1-. sea was already forming scarves of mist , and its Mu darkened while the warm red of the terrace tiles glistene in the morning dew . The whitewashed parapet had alread been conquered by the first tendrils of a triumphal rambler rose . The firm white flesh of the open petals , shar against the sea , was both voluptuous and satiating . Dow/ stairs , one room faced the foothills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the other two opened onto the garde and the sea beyond . In the garden , two pines thrust the bare trunks high into the sky , the tips alone covered wit a green and yellow pelt . From the house he could see on/ the space bracketed between these two trees , the curs of beach between the trunks . A little steamboat was movin out to sea now , and Mersault watched its entire trajector from one pine to the other . Here was where he would live . Doubtless because ti beauty of the place touched his heart  --  why else had I bought this house ? But the release he hoped to find he dismayed him , this solitude he had sought so deliberate seemed even more disturbing , now that he knew its st ting . The village was not far away , a few hundred yard He walked out of the house . A little path sloped down fro the road toward the sea . Following it , he noticed for tl first time that he could glimpse , across the bay , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silhouetted tl golden columns of the temple and around them the fall , ruins among the wormwood bushes forming , at this di tance , a blue-gray plumage . On June evenings , Mersat reflected , the wind would bring the fragrance of those su gorged shrubs across the water toward the Chenoua . He had to set up his house , organize his life . The days passed quickly . He whitewashed the walls , bong hangings in Algiers , began to install electricity ; and as went about his work , interrupted by the meals he took the village cafe and by his dips in the sea , he forgot wl be had come here and lost himself in his body 's fatigt loins aching and legs stiff , fretting over the shortage paint or the defective installation of a light fixture in t hallway . He slept at the hotel and gradually became quainted with the village : the boys who came to play IN and Ping-Pong on Sunday afternoons I they would use i table all afternoon , taking only one drink , to the owne great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along the road overlooking the sea ( they walked arm arm , and there was a caressing , sing-song note in th voices ) ; Perez the fisherman who supplied the hotel w fish and had only one arm . Here , too , he met the Air doctor , Bernard . But the day the house was entirely rea . Mersault moved all his things into it and gradually rec ered himself . It was evening . He was in the big room stairs , and behind the window two worlds fought for 1 space between the two pines . In one , almost transpare the stars multiplied . In the other , denser and darker secret palpitation of the water betrayed the sea . So far he had lived sociably enough , chatting with workmen who helped him in the house or with the owi of the cafe . But now he realized that he had no one to meet tonight , nor tomorrow , nor ever , and that he was facing his longed-for solitude at last . From the moment he no longer had to see anyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convinced himself that this was what he had wanted : nothing before him but himself for a long time- until the end . He decided to stay where he was , smoking and thinking late into the night , but by ten he was sleepy and went to bed . The next day he wakened very late , around ten , made his breakfast and ate it before washing or shaving . He felt a little tired . He had not shaved and his hair was uncombed . But after he had eaten , instead of going into the bathroom he wandered from room : o room , leafed through a magazine , and finally was deighted to find a light switch that had not been attached , and set to work . Someone knocked : the boy from the cafe ) ringing his lunch , as he had arranged the day before . He at down at his table just as he was , ate without appetite iefore the food had a chance to cool , and began to smoke , ying on the couch in the downstairs room . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it was four ? ' clock . He bathed then , shaved carefully , dressed and vrote two letters , one to Lucienne , the other to the hree girls. * It was already very late , and growing dark . *EDITOR 'S NOTE : The three girls are Claire , Rose , and Cathrine , the friends with whom Mersault lived for a month in the louse above the World . There have been hints that Catherine eves him . Nonetheless he walked to the village to mail his letters and returned without having met anyone . He went upstairs and out onto the terrace : the sea and the night were conversing on the beach and above the ruins . Mersank reflected . The memory of this wasted day embittered him . Tonight , at least , he would work , do something , read or go out and walk through the night . The garden gate creaked : his dinner was coming . lie was hungry , ate happily , then felt unable to leave the house . He decided to read late in bed . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next morning he woke up late . N THE DAYS THAT FOLLOWED , Mersault tried to struggle I against this encroachment . As the days passed , filled by the creak of the gate and countless cigarettes , he was disconcerted by the variance between the gesture that had brought him to this life and this life itself . One evening he wrote Lucienne to come , deciding to break this solitude from which he had expected so much . After the letter was sent , he was filled with a secret shame , but once Lucienne arrived the shame dissolved in a kind of mindless eager joy to rediscover a familiar being and the easy life her presence signified . He made a fuss over her , and Lucienne seemed almost surprised by his solicitude , when she was n't preoccupied with her carefully pressed white linen dresses . He took walks now , but with Lucienne . He recovered his complicity with the world . but by resting his hand on Lucienne 's shoulder . Taking refuge in humanity , he escaped his secret dread . Within two days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the moment she chose to ask him to let her live there . They were at dinner , and Mersault had simply refused , not raising his eyes from his plate . After a pause . Lucienne had added in a neutral tone of voice : " You do n't love me . " Mersault looked up . Her eyes were full of tears . He relented : " But I never said I did , my child . " " I know , " Lucienne said , " and that 's why . " Mersault stood up and walked to the window . Between the pines , the stars throbbed in the night sky . And never had Patrice felt , along with his dread , so much disgust as at this moment for the days they had just passed together . " You 're a lovely girl , Lucienne . I ca n't see any further than that . It 's all I ask of you . It has to be enough for the two of us . " " I know , " Lucienne said . She was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the tip of her knife . He walked over to her and rested a hand on the nape of her neck . " Believe me , there is no such thing as great suffering , great regret , great memory . Everything is forgotten , even a great love . That 's what 's sad about life , and also what 's wonderful about it . There is only a way of looking at things , a way that comes to you every once in a while . That 's why it 's good to have had love in your life after all , to have had an unhappy passion  --  it gives you an alibi for the vague despairs we all suffer from . " After a pause , he added : " I do n't know if you understand what I mean . " " I think I understand . " She suddenly turned her head toward Mersault . " You 're not happy . " " I will be , " Mersault said violently . " I have to be- With this night , this sea , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned back toward the window and tightened his hand over the nape of Lucienne 's neck . She said nothing . Then , without looking at him , " At least you feel friendly toward me , do n't you ? " Patrice knelt beside her and gently bit her shoulder . " Friendly , yes , the way I feel friendly toward the night . You are the pleasure of my eyes , and you do n't know what a place such joy can have in my heart . " LI HE LEFT THE NEXT DAY . And the day after that Mersault was unable to stand himself , and drove to Algiers . He went first to the House above the World . His friends promised to come to see him at the end of the month . Then he decided to visit his old neighborhood . His apartment had been rented to a man who ran a cafe . He inquired after the barrelmaker , but no one knew anything  --  someone thought he had gone to Paris to look for work . Mersault walked through the streets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not much ; Rene was still there , with his tuberculosis and his solemn expression . They were all glad to see Patrice again , and he felt moved by this encounter . " Hey , Mersault , " Celeste told him , " you have n't changed . Still the same ! " " Yes , " Mersault said . He marveled at the strange blind-ness by which men , though they are so alert to what changes in themselves , impose on their friends an image chosen for them once and for all . He was being judged by what he had been . Just as dogs do n't change character , men are dogs for one another . And precisely to the degree that Celeste , Rene , and the others had known him , he had become as alien and remote to them as an uninhabited planet . Yet he left them with affectionate farewells . And just outside the restaurant he ran into Marthe. * As soon as he saw her he realized that he had almost forgotten her and that at the same time he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ painted goddess 's face . He desired her vaguely but without conviction . They walked together . " Oh , Patrice , " she said , " I 'm so glad ! What 's become of you ? " " Nothing , as you can see . I 'm living in the country . " " Wonderful . I 've always dreamed of living in the country . " And after a silence : " You know , I 'm not angry at you or anything . " " Yes , " Mersault said , laughing , " you 've managed to console yourself . " Then Marthe spoke in a tone of voice he did not recognize . " Do n't be nasty , Patrice . I knew it would end like this some day . You were a funny guy . And I was nothing but a little girl . That 's what you always used to say .... Of course when it happened I was furious . But finally I tole myself , ' He 's unhappy . ' And you know , it 's funny , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was the first time that what we . . . that what happened between us made me feel sac and happy at the same time . " Surprised , Mersault stared at her . He suddenly realize ( that Marthe had always been very decent with him . She bac accepted hint as he was and had spared him a great dea of loneliness . He had been unfair : while his imaginatior and vanity had given her too much importance , his pride had given her too little . He discovered the cruel paradoby which we always deceive ourselves twice about the peo pie we love  --  first to their advantage , then to their disadvan tape . Today he understood that Marthe had been genuine with him  --  that she had been what she was , and that h. owed her a good deal . It was beginning to rain ? jus enough to reflect the lights of the street ; through the shin ing drops he saw Marthe 's suddenly serious ace and fel overcome by a burst of gratitude he could not express  --  i : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of love . Be he could find only stiff words : " You know , Marthe . I'r very fond of you . Even now , if there 's anything I coul do ... " She smiled : " No . I 'm young still . And I do n't do wit out .. . . " He nodded . What a distance there was between then and yet what complicity He left her in front of her ow house . She had opened her umbrella , saying , " I hope we ' see each other again . " " Yes , " Mersault said . She gave him a sad little smile " Oh , that 's your little girl 's face . " She had stepped ini the doorway and closed her umbrella . Patrice held out h " EDITOR 'S NOTE : Zagreus had kept a suicide note always rear to remind him of the other option to life . Patrice used it to coin the murder , which he accomplished with Zagreus ' own piste Thus the killing went undetected , and Marthe , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand and smiled in his turn . " ' Till next time , image . " She ' lugged him quickly , kissed him on both cheeks , and ran ipstairs . Mersault , standing in the rain , still felt Marthe 's : old nose and warm lips on his cheeks . And that sudden , lisinterested kiss had all the purity of the one given him iy the freckled little whore in Vienna . : le became one with a life in its pure state , le rediscovered a paradise given only to the most intelligent animals . At the point where the mind denies the mind , he ouched his truth and with it his extreme ; lory , his extreme love . " Then he went to find Lucienne , slept at her apartment , nd asked her to walk with him on the boulevards . It was lmost noon when they came downstairs . Orange boats ere drying in the sun like fruit cut in quarters . The ouble flock of pigeons and their shadows swooped down the docks and up again in a long . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air grew stifling . Mersault watched te red-and-black steamer slowly gain the channel , put on teed , and gradually veer toward the streak of light glisiting where the sky met the sea . For the onlookers , there a bitter sweetness in every departure . " They 're lucky , " ucienne said . " Yes . " He was thinking , " No " ? or at least that he d n't envy them their luck . For him , too , starting over , pastures , a new life had a certain luster , but he knew at only the impotent and the lazy attach happiness to ch things . Happiness implied a choice , and within that oice a concerted will , a lucid desire . He could hear tgreus : " Not the will to renounce , but the will to happiss . " He had his arm around Lucienne , and her warm east rested in his hand . ' , HAT SAME EVENING , as he drove back to the Chenoua , . Mersault felt an enormous silence in himself as he et:1 the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a fresh start , by becoming aware of his past , had defined what he wanted and what he did not want be . Those wasted days he had been ashamed of seemed ngerous but necessary now . He might have foundered to and missed his one chance , his one justification . But er all , he had to adapt himself to everything . Rounding one curve after the next , Mersault steeped aself in this humiliating yet priceless truth : the condins of the singular happiness he sought were getting up ly every morning , taking a regular swim  --  a conscious siene . He drove very fast , resolved to take advantage his discovery in order to establish himself in a routine t would henceforth require no further effort , to harnize his own breathing with the deepest rhythm of time . ife itself . l'he next morning he got up early and walked down to sea . The sky was already brilliant and the morning of rustling wings and crying birds . But the sun was y touching the horizon 's curve , and when Mersault @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swimming in an indeterminate darkness until , as the sun climbed higher , he thrust his arms into streaks of icy red and gold . Then he swam back to land and walked up to his house . His body felt alert and ready for whatever the day might bring . Every morning , now , he came downstairs just before sunrise , and this first action controlled the rest of his day . Moreover , these swims exhausted him , but at the same time , because of the fatigue and the energy they afforded , they gave his entire day a flavor of abandonment and joyful lassitude . Yet the hours still seemed long to him  --  he had not yet detached time from a carcass of habits that still punctuated the past . He had nothing to do , and his time stretched out , measureless , before him . Each minute recovered its miraculous value , but he did not yet recognize it for what it was . Just as the days of a journey seem interminable whereas in an office the trajectory from Monday occurs in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ props , still tried to locate them in a life that had nothing but itself to consider . Sometimes he picked up his watch and stared as the minute hand shifted from one number to the next , marveling that five minutes should seem so interminable . Doubtless that watch opened the way  --  a painful and tormenting way  --  that leads to the supreme art of doing nothing . He learned to walk ; sometimes in the afternoon he would walk along the beach as far as the ruins of Tipasa ; then he would lie down among the wormwood bushes , and with his hands on the warm stone would open his eyes and his heart to the intolerable grandeur of that seething sky . He matched the pounding of his blood with the violent pulsation of the sun at two o'clock , and deep in the fierce fragrance , deafened by the invisible insects , he watched the sky turn from white to deep-blue , then pale to green , pouring down its sweetness upon the still-warm ruins . He would walk home early then , and go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his days were organized according to a rhythm whose deliberation and strangeness became as necessary to him as had been his office , his restaurant , and his sleep in his mother 's room . In both cases , he was virtually unconscious of it . But now . in his hours of lucidity , he felt that time was his own , that in the brief interval that finds the sea red and leaves it green , something eternal was represented for him in each second . Beyond the curve of the days he glimpsed neither superhuman happiness nor eternity  --  happiness was human . eternity ordinary . What mattered was to humble himself , to organize his heart to match the rhythm of the days instead of submitting their rhythm to the curve of human hopes . Just as there is a moment when the artist must stop , when the sculpture must be left as it is , the painting untouched  --  just as a determination not to know serves the maker more than all the resources of clairvoyance  --  so there must be a minimum of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Those who lack such a thing must set about acquiring it : unintelligenee must be earned . O N SUNDAYS , IYEERSAULT PLAYED POOL with Perez . The old fisherman , one arm a stump cut off above the elbow , played pool in a peculiar fashion , puffing out his chest and leaning his stump on the cue . When they went out fishing in the morning . Perez rowed with the same skill , and Mersault admired the way he would stand in the boat pushing one oar with his chest , the other with his good hand . The two men got along well . After the morning 's fishing , Perez cooked cuttlefish in a hot sauce , stewing them in their own ink , and soaking up the black juice left in the pan with pieces of bread . As they sat in the fisherman 's kitchen over the sooty stove , Perez never spoke , and Mersault was grateful to him for this gift of silence . Sometimes , after his morning swim , he would see the old man putting his boat in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 conic with you , Perez ? " " Get in . " They put the oars in the locks and rowed together , Mersault being careful not to catch his feet in the trawling hooks . Then they would fish , and Mersault would watch the lines , gleaming to the water 's surface , black and wavering underneath . The sun broke into a thousand fragments on the sea , and Mersault breathed the heavy stifling smell that rose from it like fumes . Sometimes Perez pulled in a little fish he would throw back , saying : " Go home to your mother . " At eleven they rowed home , and Mersault , his hands glistening with scales and his face swollen with sun , waited in his cool dark house while Perez prepared a pan of fish they would eat too-ether in the evening . Day after day , Mersault let himself sinkinto his life as if he were sliding into water . And just as the swimmer advances by the complicity of his arms and the water that hears him up , helps him on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  to rest one hand on a tree trunk , to take a run on the beach -- in order to keep himself intact and conscious .

At the point where the mind denies the mind , he touched his truth and with it his extreme glory , his extreme love . Thanks to Bernard , he also mingled with the life of the village . He had been obliged to send for Bernard to treat some minor indisposition , and since then they had seen man , but he had a kind of bitter wit that cast a gleam in his horn-rimmed glasses . He had practiced medicine a long time in indochina and at forty had retired to his corner of Algeria , where for several years he had led a tranquil life with his wife , an almost mute Indochinese who wore Western clothes and arranged her hair in a bun . Bernard 's capacity for indulgence enabled him to adapt himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was liked in return . He took Mersault on his rounds . Mersault already knew the owner of the cafe , a former tenor who would sing behind his bar and between two beats of Tosca threaten his wife with a heating .... I N SPRINGTIME , THE LITTLE VILLAGE with its close-set red roofs between the mountain and the sea overflowed with flowers  --  roses , hyacinths , bougainvilleas  --  and hummed with insects . Afternoons , Mersault would walk out onto his terrace and watch the village dozing under the torrent of light . Local history consisted of a rivalry between Morales and Bingues , two rich Spanish landowners whom a series of speculations had transformed into millionaires and from that moment swept them up in a fever of competitive self-importance . When one bought a car , I chose the most expensive make ; but the other , who wou : buy the same make , would add silver door handle Morales was a genius at such tactics .

The plane wt still sleeping in its hangar , and was shown to visitors c Sundays . Bingues called Morales " that barefoot beggar . and Morales referred to Bingues as " that lime kiln . " Bernard took Mersault to visit Morales , who welcome them warmly to his huge farm , humming with wasps ar fragrant with grapes . Wearing espadrilles and shirtsleev because he could not endure a jacket and shoes , Moral . showed them the airplane , the son 's medal framed the living room , and explained the necessity of keeph foreigners out of Algeria the was naturalized , " but th Bingues , for instance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ latest acquisition . They walked through an enormous via yard in the middle of which was a cleared space where kind of Louis XV salon had been set up , each piece ma of the most precious woods and fabrics . Thus Moral could receive visitors on his grounds . When Mersault cot teously asked what happened when it rained , Moral shifted his cigar and without even blinking answere " I replace it . " On his way home , Mersault spent the tit arguing with Bernard over the difference between t nouveau riche and the poet . Morales , according to Bernal was a poet . Mersault declared he would have made splendid Roman emperor during the decline . Sonic time later , Lucien-lie came to the Chenoua fo few days , then left . One Sunday morning , Claire , Rc and Catherine paid Mersault a visit , as they had promis But Patrice was already very far from the state of m that had driven him to Algiers during the first days his retreat . He was glad to see them again , neverthel and brought Bernard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let them off . It was a magnificent day , village full of the fine red carts of itinerant butch flowers everywhere , and the villagers dressed in bri colors . At Catherine 's request they took a table at caf ? , and the girls marveled at all this brilliant life , di ing the sea 's presence behind the wall they leaned agai As they were leaving , an astonishing burst of music ploded in a nearby street : the toreador song from Corn but performed with an exuberance that prevented . ? ? gnas DIN Friedmann truments from keeping in tune or time . " The gymnastic : ; iety , " Bernard explained . Then some twenty strange isicians appeared , each puffing on a different kind of nd instrument . They marched toward the cafe , and bend them , his hat worn over a handkerchief on the back his head , fanning himself with a cheap fan , appeared wales .

" ' is they left , the girls were choking with laughter , but : e they reached Mersault 's house and the cool shade he rooms , which emphasized the dazzling whiteness of sun-drenched garden walls , they discovered a silent inony that Catherine expressed by the desire to take a bath on the terrace . Mersault walked Bernard home . s was the second time the doctor had glimpsed someig of Mersault 's life ; they had never confided in each Mersault conscious that Bernard was not a happy 1 , and Bernard rather baffled by Mersault 's way of They parted without a word . Mersault and the girls ided to make an excursion the following day , starting r early . The Chenoua was high and difficult to climb  --  ad of them lay a splendid day of sunlight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slopes . Rose and Claire walked ahead , Patrice and Catherine following . No one spoke . Gradually they rose above the sea , still pale in the morning mist . Patrice felt he belonged to the mountain , with its pelt of saffron blossoms , his eager but weakening body a part of the icy springs , the shadows , and the sunlight . They entered into the concentrated effort of climbing , the morning air sharp in their lungs , determined to conquer the slope . Rose and Claire , exhausted , began to slow down . Catherine and Patrice walked on , and soon lost sight of the other two . " Are you all right ? " Patrice asked . " Yes , it 's beautiful . " The sun rose in the sky , and with it a hum of insects swelled in the growing warmth . Soon Patrice took off his shirt and walked on bare-chested . Sweat ran down his shoulders , where the skin had peeled with sunhurn . They took a little path that seemed to follow the mountainside . The grass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diem , and in a hollow they almost stumbled over the sudden gush of coolness and shade . They sprinkled each other , drank a little , and Catherine stretched out on the grass while Patrice , his hair black with water and curling over his forehead , stared blinking over the landscape that was covered with ruins , gleaming roads , and splinters of sunlight . Then he sat down beside Catherine . " While we 're alone , Mersault , tell me  --  are you happy now " Look , " Mersault said . The road trembled in the sun , and the air was filled with a thousand colored specks . He smiled and rubbed his arms . " Yes , but ... Well , I wanted to ask you  --  of course you do n't have to answer if you do n't want to ... " She hesitated : " Do you love your wife ? " Mersault smiled : " That 's not essential . " He gripped Catherine 's shoulder and shook his head , sprinkling water into her face . " You make the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to do what you want , that there are conditions for happiness . What matters  --  all that matters , really  --  is the will to happiness , a kind of enormous , ever-present consciousness . The rest  --  women , art , success  --  is nothing but excuses . A canvas waiting for our embroideries . " " Yes , " Catherine said , her eyes filled with sunlight . " What matters to me is a certain quality of happiness . I can only find it in a certain struggle with its opposite a stubborn and violent struggle . Am I happy ? Catherine ! You know the famous formula ? ' if I had my life to live over again ' ? well , I would live it over again just the way it has been . Of course you ca n't know what that means . " " No. ? " And I do n't know how to tell you . If I 'm happy , it 's because of my had conscience . I had to get away and reach this solitude where I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be faced , what was sun and what was tears ... Yes , I 'm happy , in human terms . " Rose and Claire arrived . They shouldered their knapsacks . The path still followed the mountainside , keeping them in a zone of dense vegetation , prickly pears , olive trees , and jujubes . They passed Arabs on donkeys . Then they climbed again . The sun pounded now on each stone in the path . At noon , crushed by the heat , drunk on fragrance and fatigue , they flung down their knapsacks and gave up reaching the top . The slopes were sheer and full of sharp flints . A wizened oak sheltered them in its circle of shade . They took provisions out of the knapsacks and ate . The whole mountain quivered under the light . The cicadas were deafening as the heat assailed them under their oak . Patrice threw himself on the ground and pressed his chest against the stones , inhaling the scorched aroma . Under his belly he could feel the faint throbs of the mountain that seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unremitting song of the insects between the hot stones finally put him to sleep . ' ; THEN HE WAKENED he was covered with sweat , and V every muscle ached . It must have been three in the afternoon . The girls had vanished , but soon he heard their laughter and shouts . It was cooler now , time to go back down . At this moment , as they were about to start , Mersault fainted for the first time . When he came to , he saw the cobalt sea between three anxious faces . They walked on more slowly . On the last slopes , Mersault asked for a rest . The sea was turning green along with the sky , and the horizon began to blur . On the foothills that stretched from the Chenoua around the little bay , the cypresses blackened slowly . No one spoke , until Claire said : " You look tired . " " I 'm not surprised . Are you ? " " Only today did his solitude become real , for only today did he feel bound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to know that henceforth he was the master of all his days to come , filled him with the melancholy that is attached to all greatness Catherine decided to send for Bernard . Mersault WE in his room ; beyond the shifting shadow of the windol panes he could see the white patch of the parapet , the s ( like a strip of dark linen undulating in the transparent ai and beyond it the night sky , paler but starless . He fr weak , and his weakness made him mysteriously lights gayer , and his mind grew more lucid . When &mai; knocked , Mersault sensed he would tell him everythin Not that his secret was a burden ; it was not that kind secret . If he had kept it till now , it was because in certa circles a man keeps his thoughts to himself , knowing th , will offend the prejudices and stupidity of others . B today , after his exhaustion , there was a sudden longii in his body to confide . It was the way an artist , after cat fully molding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to show it , to communicate with men  --  Mersault h the feeling he was going to speak now . And without bci certain that he would do so , he waited impatiently i Bernard . From downstairs , two bursts of laughter made h smile . And at that moment Bernard came into the roo " Well ? " " Well , here I am , " Mersault said . Bernard listened his chest , but he could tell nothing  --  he wanted to have X ray taken , if . Mersault could manage to get to Algic " Later , " Mersault replied . Bernard said nothing and sat down on the windows " I do n't like being sick myself , " he said . " I know wha is . Nothing is uglier or more degrading than sickness . " Mersault was unconcerned . He got up from his chu offered Bernard a cigarette , lit his own , and said wit laugh : " Can I ask you a question , Bernard ? " " Of course . " " You never swim , you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to live in ? " " Oh , I do n't know exactly . It was a long time a@ After a pause he added : " Besides , I 've always acted on rancor . It 's better now . Before , I wanted to be happy do what had to be done , to settle down somewhere I re . wanted to be , for instance . But sentimental anticipation is always wrong . We have to live the way it 's easiest for us to live not forcing ourselves . I suppose it sounds a little cynical , but it 's also the point of view you have to take to survive . In Indochina I ran all over the place . Here  --  here I just ruminate . That 's all . " " Yes , " Mersault said , still smoking . deep in his armchair and staring at the ceiling . " But I 'm not sure that all sentimental anticipation , as you call it , is wrong . Only unreasonable sometimes . In any case , the only experiences that interest me are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way you hoped it would . " Bernard smiled . " Yes , a ready-made destiny . " " A man 's destiny , " Mersault said without moving , - is ilways passionately interesting , if he achieves it passionitely . And for some men , a passionate destiny is always a - eady- made destiny . " " Yes , " Bernard said . And he stood up deliberately and ; tared out at the night for a moment , his back to Mer- ; ault . He went on without looking at him : " You 're the mly man besides myself around here who lives alone . I lo n't mean your wife and your friends downstairs . I know hose are episodes . Still , even so , you seem to love life nore than I do . " He turned around . " Because for me , oving life is not going for a swim . It 's living in intoxicaion , intensity . Women , adventures , other countries ... t 's action , making something happen . A burning , marelous life . What I mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He seemed ashamed of his excitement . " I love life oo much to be satisfied with nature . " Bernard put away is stethoscope and closed his bag . Mersault said : " Actually , you 're an idealist . " And he ad the sense that everything was enclosed in that moment rat shifts from birth to death , that everything was judged nd consecrated then . " That 's because , you see , " Bernard said with a kind f sadness , " the opposite of an idealist is too often a an without love . " " Do n't believe it , " Mersault said , holding out his hand . Bernard held his hand a long time . " To think the way . tou do , " he said smiling , ' you have to he a man who ? es either on a tremendous despair , or on a tremendous ape . " " On both , perhaps . " " Oh , I was n't asking ! " " I know , " Mersault said seriously . But when Bernard as at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , died him back . " Yes ? " the doctor said , turning around . " Arc you capable of feeling contempt for a man ? " " I think so . " " On what conditions ? " The doctor reflected . " It 's quite simple , I think . In ses when lie was motivated by expediency or a desire for oney . " " That is simple , " Mersault said . " Goodnight , Bernard . " " Goodnight . " Alone , Mersault reflected . At the point he had now ached , another man 's contempt left him indifferent . But recognized in Bernard profound resonances that ought the two of them together . It seemed intolerable it a part of himself should condemn the rest . Had be acted out of expediency ? He had become aware of the essential and immoral truth that money is one of the surest and swiftest means of acquiring one 's dignity . He had managed to dispel the bitterness that besets any decent soul aware of the vile iniquities of the birth and growth of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whereby the poor end in poverty the life they have begun in poverty , he had rejected by using money as a weapon , opposing hatred with hatred . And oul of this beast-to-beast combat , the angel sometimes emerged , intact , wings and halo and all , in the warm breath of the sea . It would be as it had been : he had said nothing to Bernard , and his creation would henceforth remain secret . rrILIE GIRLS LEFT AROUND FIVE O'CLOCK in the afternoon I of the next day . As they got into the bus , Catherine turned back : " Goodbye , sea , " she said . A moment later , three laughing faces were staring at Mersault out of the rear window , and the yellow bus vanished like a huge golden insect into the sun . Though clear , the sky was a little heavy . Mersault , standing alone in the road , felt a deep sense of deliverance tinged with melancholy . Only today did his solitude become real , for only today did he feel bound to it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that henceforth he was the master of all his days to come , filled him with the melancholy that is attached to all greatness . Instead of taking the highway , he returned through the carob trees and the olives , following a little path that wound around the foothills and came out behind his house . He squashed several olives , and noticed that the path was speckled with these black ovals . At the summer 's end , the carobs drench all Algeria with the smell of love , and in the evening or after the rain , it is as if the entire earth were resting , after giving itself to the sun , its womb drenched with a sperm smelling of bitter almonds . All day , their odor had poured down from the huge trees , heavy and oppressive . On this little path at twilight , in the released exhalations of earth , the fragrance grew light , scarcely apparent to Patrice 's nostrils  --  like a mistress you walk with in the street after a long stifling afternoon , and who looks at you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crowd . Amid the smell of love and squashed , fragrant fruit , Mersault realized then that the season was ending . A long winter would begin . But he was ready for it , he would wait . From this path he could not see the sea , but he could glimpse on the mountaintop certain reddish mists that heralded the dark . On the ground , patches of sunshine paled among the shadows of the foliage . Mersault sniffed the bitter fragrance that consecrated his wedding to the earth this afternoon . The evening falling on the world , on the path between the olives and the gum trees , on the vines and the red soil , near the sea that whispered softly , this evening flowed into him like a tide . So many evenings had promised him happiness that to experience this one as happiness itself made him realize how far he had come , from hope to conquest . In the innocence of his heart , Mersault accepted this green sky and this love-soaked earth with the same thrill of passion and desire as when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ? ryright ? 1971 by Editions Gallintard .
