The American tourist cashing his traveler 's check at Tokyo 's Hotel Okura got a bundle of good news . Each of his dollars bought 280 yen , 15 more than the going rate just two weeks before . " The difference is n't much , " he smiled , " but suddenly I feel a hell of a lot better . The good old U.S. dollar is getting back to where it should be-the world 's best money . " <P> If not the world 's best , the dollar surely is the world 's most revivified currency . Devaluation and floating the dollar against other currencies shaved 10.5% off its worldwide buying power between February and July . ( An earlier devaluation , in 1971 , had trimmed it by 3% . ) By last week , though , the dollar had rapidly reduced its 10.5% loss to 6.2% ( see chart ) . Many bankers believe that the dollar is still undervalued . <P> U.S. money is strengthening because the balance of trade has shifted dramatically from a deficit of $6.9 billion last year to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this year . The balance of payments , which includes loans , investments and items like tourist spending , as well as trade , has moved from a $10.3 billion deficit last year to a surplus of $2.1 billion in the third quarter of this year , the Commerce Department reported last week . The devaluations have made U.S. goods less expensive and more competitive in world markets . The commodities boom , which has brought record exports of soybeans , wheat and corn this year , has been another major factor . Meanwhile , prices of foreign goods are rising because the rate of inflation is averaging 8.9% in Western Europe and 14.6% in Japan , compared with " only " 7.4% in the U.S. <P> The oil crisis has also brought on a sizable rise in the dollar 's value because the U.S. depends much less on the Arabs ' oil than the Europeans and Japanese do . As oil becomes scarcer and costlier , their industries stand to be hit painfully , and they will have to spend proportionately more than the U.S. for imported petroleum . These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As foreign currencies decline , the dollar should become relatively stronger . Alan Murray , a vice president of New York 's First National City Bank , predicts that the dollar will float up another 10% next year . <P> In addition , the Federal Reserve Board and the central banks of six European nations took a step last week that reflected growing confidence in the dollar . The bankers announced that they will consider themselves free to sell gold on the open market at any price they can get . Under the old " two-tier " system , in effect since 1968 , they were allowed to sell their gold only to other central banks at the " official " price , now $42.22 an ounce . Meanwhile , prices on the free market this year soared to more than $125 , as many speculators sold dollars and other currencies in order to buy gold . The bankers had considered scrapping the obsolete two-tier system for months , but hesitated , fearing that to do so would cause unwarranted confusion in a market upset by the dollar 's unpredictability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move .
