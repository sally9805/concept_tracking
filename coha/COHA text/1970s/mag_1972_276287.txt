For nearly ten years NBC 's Johnny Carson has monopolized TV 's late hours with his facile , funny and cool show-biz chatter . ABC hoped to cut into his audience with Dick Cavett and a more intellectual approach . CBS aimed to bring him down with that old Beverly Hillbilly Merv Griffin . But neither even approached his ratings , and Carson remained undisputed king of the insomniacs . No longer . Since CBS replaced Griffin with a lineup of late movies twelve weeks ago , Carson , for the first time in a decade , has found himself in a ratings race . <P> It is a race he often loses . Since the movies began , they have topped Carson 's ratings seven out of nine times , although in the latest Nielsen report , Carson averaged a 32.5% share of the viewing audience v. CBS 's 31% . ( CBS 's Griffin , by contrast , had drawn around 16% of the late watchers and ABC 's Cavett has drawn about 13% . ) <P> NBC argues-and has the figures to prove it-that though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his total number of viewers has remained constant . CBS , it contends , has grabbed a whole new audience of diehard film buffs that was not watching the talk shows . Still , the film phenomenon must give pause to Carson , who last week moved his show from New York to Los Angeles , hoping , among other things , that he will be able to attract more show business guests on the West Coast . What makes it all the worse is that Carson 's competition comes mostly from B-grade flicks . <P> The other talk shows are having problems as well-and not just from the late movie . It was announced last week that David Frost 's syndicated talk show would die at the end of June , and ABC has warned Dick Cavett that unless his ratings are improved in the next three months , the show would be dropped in the fall . Cavett counters that ABC has been " lazy , inept and incompetent " in promoting his show . What would take his place ? ABC talks grandly of a " major program @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as its ratings keep up , CBS will be happy with its own " development effort " - dusting off cans of old movies .
