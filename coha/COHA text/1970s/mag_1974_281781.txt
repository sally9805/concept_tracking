For the better part of a decade , Film Documentarian Frederick Wiseman has been sending us-mostly over the Public Broadcasting Service-a series of Goyaesque pictures from our institutions . The police , the courts , hospitals , a high school , the Army , even a monastery have given him his subjects . In almost every instance he has found them to be butterfingered bureaucracies . They show more dedication to preserving the untroubled functioning of their own administrative systems than to doing their job , which is usually supposed to be helping people . What has made these brutal films bearable is that time after time Wiseman has discovered competent , even loving individuals struggling within these systems not only to assert their own humanity but to help society 's cripples and victims to maintain theirs . <P> PRIMATE .

The excitement of the researchers rises to almost orgasmic heights in the process , though just what they are doing-other than transforming life into a sliced abstraction-is unclear .
