txt Little Llewelyn could use some refinement , but he does n't look like boarding school material . Besides setting his sister 's hair on fire , scrawling graffiti on the church driveway and swiping a March of Dimes canister from the drugstore , he only got an F-plus in English last year and still takes off his shoes to do multiplication . Try to enroll him anyway . This year you just might make it . That 's because many boarding prep schools ca n't afford to be too fussy about whom they admit . After long being able to pick and choose among droves of applicants , they now are finding that fewer and fewer people are interested in sending them their sons and daughters for refinement  --  and a leg-up into college . For the past couple of years , in fact , many schools have had difficulty getting all the students they need . Enrollment in the 192 boarding high schools that are members of the National Association of Independent Schools , for example , declined slightly last school year from 1968-69 ; also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by NAIS turned up 34 last year that were n't full , compared with 20 the previous year . Lower Standards Final figures for the school year just starting are n't ready yet , but NAIS vice president John Chandler expects that they will show further erosion in enrollment . Authorities blame the slump on growing youthful distaste for the isolation and the starchy atmosphere of many boarding schools , coupled with improvements in public school systems that influence parents to keep their children at home . The economic decline has n't helped a bit , either ; when Daddy 's blown a bundle in the market , old PS 88 looks good enough for junior . All this has left the schools little choice . While none is avidly seeking basket cases like Llewelyn , many have had to lower their standards to fill their beds . Scott Meadow is one of many boys pleased to discover that . Scott 's two years in a public high school in Dayton , Ohio , yielded a lackluster C-plus average and the conviction that he would do better in the " prison @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to three well-regarded places- : - Salisbury , Kent Hotchkiss . Scott was n't expecting admission to any of them . His mediocre grades and the fact that his parents were n't prep school alumni made his applications just so many shots in the dark , he felt . But all three accepted him and he chose Salisbury . " Three years ago I could not have gotten him into those schools , " says Howard Greene , a Wilton , Conn. , educational consultant who. counseled Scott and ' helped place him . " Today , I have a dozen others he could walk into . " Some Schools Close This does n't mean that boarding schools everywhere are in serious trouble . Some of the best-known Eastern schools , while not getting as many applicants as they once did , are still turning people away . Choate , Lawrenceville and Phillips Exeter are full this term , for example . But many schools have not been as fortunate . T. Holmes Moore , chairman of the Commission on Independent Schools of the New England Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ England boarding schools are n't reopening this term because they could n't find enough students to support them . One forced out of business was St. Peter 's in PeekskM , N.Y . which wound up last year with 40 of its 120 beds empty and a. debt of $100,000 . Louis , president of the St. Peter 's board of trustees , feels that his school 's failure will be only one of many among smaller institutions in the next few years . Boarding schools ' troubles are compounded by their discovery that they no longer provide near-automatic entry into the Ivy League for their pupils . Both Harvard and Yale , for example , say that about 40% of their undergraduates now come from private schools ; 10 years ago 60% - did . Seeking More Diversity One reason for the shift is that public school systems have been improving at such a rate that both boarding schools and private day schools have bad trouble keeping up with them , says Henry Chauncey Jr. , director of university admissions and financial aid policy at Yale . Calvin Mosley , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that his school and others in the Ivy League are striving for more diversity in their student bodies . This makes more room for minority-group students and others from low-income families and leaves less for the affluent youngsters who still predominate at Eastern prep schools despite the efforts of a few institutions to enroll poor urban and rural youths as scholarship students . But boarding school officials agree that the biggest problem they have in attracting applicants is the changing attitude of their student prospects . " They 're weighing the confinement of boarding school against staying home with girls , booze , pot and cars , " says Michael Choukas Jr. , headmaster of Vermont Academy in Sextons River , Vt . Boarding school is losing and so is Mi . Choukas ; Vermont Academy has 186 beds but had only 173 boarders last ? year and no more than that this term . Mr. Choultas concedes that the school has ' begun - accepting students who are " toward the lower end of the spectrum " and who might have been rejected a couple of years ago . Those who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no longer want to escape the city . for the countrified campuses of the prep ** a new focus of activity in the cities . They 're where the action is now . " says Frank Strasburger , who has taught in both a Connecticut boarding school and a private day school in Baltimore . By contrast , there often is little to do at the boarding schools , and some students who have tried them are dropping out . David Yale , a 15yearold from New Haven , went to a Massachusetts boarding school two years ago to please his mother but did n't stay long . He had trouble studying , there was a lack of social and extracurricular activities , and David  --  as the youngest boy in his dormitory  --  was picked on by the others . " There was nothing for anyone to do but punch me out . " says David . He 's in a public school now . Some teachers and others suggest that some parents may also be keeping their children home so they can keep a closer eye on them ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's hard to gauge how prevalent these sentiments are , but it is easy to see that some parents have another reason ; they can no longer afford boarding school , which generally costs $3,000 to $4,000 a year . Turning to Coeducation Andrew Holmes , headmaster of the Oak Grove School , Vassalboro , Me. , blames his school 's problems on the current sluggish economy . The girls ' school sent bills for $1,625 , half the annual charge , to parents few weeks ago ; 11 cancelations promptly came back from parents , " who said essentially that the financial situation had n't improved as they thought it would , " according to Mr. Holmes . Oak Grove , which has the capacity to board 70 girls , now has far fewer enrolled and for the first time has been forced to take day students . Some of those are boys , another first . " We all hope that having boys here will make the school more attractive , " says Mr. Holmes . Many schools have gone co-ed in the past few years , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monasticism of all-boy and all-girl institutions . Others have relaxed or done away with regulations that today 's youth find childish or unreasonable . Besides going co-ed this January after 115 years as a boy 's school , St. Paul 's School in Concord , N.H. , will require students to attend chapel only four times a week instead of eight times . It will continue allowing students to leave the ' school on weekends , a policy it adopted only two years ago . Using Advertising Abbot Academy , an Andover , Mass. , girls ' school , last year began giving students permission to leave on weekends , with parental permission . " The trend definitely has been toward a loosening up , " says Faith Kaiser , director of admissions . " But they ca n't go spend the night in a Harvard dorm . " While they try to make their campuses a little less stuffy , school officials also beat the bushes for new students , a departure from previous procedure , when students came to them . Advertising , once shunned by many boarding schools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to high schools and junior high schools are being made more frequently . ? The co-ed craze continues ; Robert Parsons , a Boston education counselor , estimates that at least 15 schools will admit both sexes for the first time this year . Mr. Parsons who places 150 to 200 students a year , ca n't pretend that the prep school pinch has been such a bad thing for him and his colleagues . When applicants were beating on the boarding schools ' doors , he sometimes had difficulty calling admissions officials and did n't get answers to his letters . " Now I 'm invited to lunch three times a week , " he chuckles.
