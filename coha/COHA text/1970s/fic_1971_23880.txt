something that will live . So much documentation of the suddenly frightening American situation is indeed a problem in our fiction just now ; the age of high and proud art has yielded to the climate of crisis . Oates ' many stories resemble a card index of situations ; they are not the deeply plotted stories that we return to as perfect little dramas ; her novels , though they involve the reader because of the author 's intense connection with her material , tend , as incident , to fade out of our minds . Too much happens . Indeed , hers are altogether strange books , haunting rather than " successful , " because the mind behind them is primarily concerned with a kind of Darwinian struggle for existence between minds , with the truth of the universal human struggle . We miss the perfectly suggestive shapes that modern art and fiction have taught us to venerate . Oates is perhaps a Cassandra bewitched by her private oracle . But it is not disaster that is most on her mind ; it is , rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the coming disturbance .

So her characters are opaque , ungiving 1 charming ; they have the taciturn qualities tL. come with the kind of people they are  --  heavy , Kalil cinated , outside the chatty middle class . Socim speaks in them , but they are not articulate . They not yet feel themselves to be emancipated persotil They are caught up in the social convulsion at , move unheedingly , compulsively , blindly , thrnu ' " the paces assigned to them by the power god . That is exactly what Oates ' work expresses Jul now : a sense that American life is taking some us by the throat . " Too much " is happening : mad will disappear .

The park they were in was a small noisy island around which traffic moved in a continual stream . Aged , listless men sat on other benches  --  a few women shoppers , pausing to rest , their eyes eagle-bright and their gloved fingers tugging at the straps of shoes or at hemlines  --  a few children , Negro and white , urchins from the tenement homes a few blocks off this wide main street . Great untidy flocks of pigeons rose and settled again and rose , startled , scattering . Lawrence Pryor looked at everything keenly . He knew that he was out of place here ; he had come down from his office because his eleven o'clock appointment had canceled out ; he was free for half an hour . The only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who held her baby up to her face and took no interest at all in the pigeons or the chattering 82 children or Lawrence himself . He was sitting in patch of sunlight that fell upon him through narrow channel between two tail buildings , as singling him out for a blessing . All these women shoppers ! He watched th ' cross quickly to the island , and quickly over to other curb , for they rarely had the time to sit 3 rest . They were in a hurry . Because of them , ing across the street , traffic was hacked up wall to make right-hand turns . Out of the crowd of sh pers he saw a blond woman appear , walking Os and confidently . She hurried against a red light a horn sounded . How American she was , how % ' dressed and sure of herself !

He tapped his jaw with tips of his fingers in a gesture of amused surge . of course ! Beverly ! As if acting out embaront for an audience , he smiled up toward the and when he looked hack , his wife was eady flurrying across the street , moving bravely inst the light while buses and taxicabs pressed ward . e ? rot to his feet to follow her . But an extraordiilv tall man got in front of him , walking quickly , then a small crowd of women shoppers , every-hurrying now that the light had turned green . mottling held Lawrence back . The tall man was Trying as if to catch up with Beverly . He was angely tall , freakishly tall , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tight little is like grapes . He wore a dark coat , and on the ck of his neck there was a vivid red birthmark , a ' , I in the shape of a finger . The shoppers moved in front of Lawrence , and the tall man onvard , and Lawrence 's wife moved into the distance . All this motion made Lawrence feel slightly dizzy . The legend about him was his fanaticism about work : Beverly complained of this , she worried about it , she was proud of it . He was a doctor and his patients were sacred to hint . And so he had better not run after his wife , because she would be alarmed to see him out on the street at this time of day , and because it might be ten or fifteen minutes before be could get away again . She might want him to have lunch with her . She might want him to go into stores with her . Better to stay behind , to stay hidden . So he watched her disappear  --  his wife hurrying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down again , feeling oddly pleased and excited . He felt as if something secret had been revealed to " him . Beside him the young woman was leaning o , her face to her child , whispecin , " - She had a pale , angu-eler face , illuminated by love , or by the child 's ecting face . or by the narrow patch of sunlight at was moving slowly from Lawrence and onto her . Women , seen like this , were gifts to men . He considered smiling at her . But no , that might mistake  --  this was not a city in which people led freely at one another . nth ALTMAN CAME INTO THE OFFICE , striding forward with his head slightly lowered . Bald , Only forty-five . He had a portly , arrogant body , , his clothes were always jaunty  --  today he wore ( bright yellow necktie that jumped in Lawrence 's Shaking hands . liow are you ?

Altman 's wife Connie was a friend of Lawrence 's wife . It seemed to Lawrence that the women in their circle were all close friends ; in a way they blended into one another . The husbands , too , seemed to blend into one another . Many of them had several lives , but the lives were somehow shared . They lived in one dimension but turned up in other dimensions  --  downtown late in the afternoon , or in downriver suburbs . Their expensive homes and automobiles and boats could not quite contain them . Too much energy . Urgent , clicking , demanding words . While Altman talked angrily about his insomnia and switched onto the complaints of his wife and then onto the complaints of his girl , Lawrence saw again his own wife in the distance of his imaginaton , a dream he had dreamt while awake , moving freely and happily along the sidewalk of this massive city . What mystery was in her , this woman he had lived with for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They had known each other for two decades . And yet , seeing her like that , Lawrence had been struck by the mystery of her separateness , her being .... Altman said in a furious whisper , " I 'm going to have her followed ! " " Your wife ? " " Evie . Evelyn . Twenty-five years old , a baby , and she tells me the plans she dreams up ! She wants me to marry her next year ! " The numerals of Lawrence 's watch were greenish-white , glowing up out of a dark face . They were supposed to glow in the dark but they glowed in the light as well . " All right , " Altman said , seeing Lawrence look at his watch . " so I 'm wasting your time with this . So . Check my heart , my blackened lungs , tap me on the back to see if I have echoes inside , to see what 's hollowed out  --  I 'm a sick man , we both know that . Here I am . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refilled Altman 's prescription for barbiturates . It was for six refills , and Altman would be back again in a few weeks . At the door Altman paused dramatically . His white shirt front bulged . " Why do they keep after me ? " he said . " Larry , what is it ? Why are they always after me ? I ca n't sleep at night . I 'm planning a trip in my mind but when I get up I ca n't remember it  --  I do n't sleep but I do n't remember what I think about . Why are they always after me , those women ? What are they doing to me ? " AWRENCE AND HIS WIFE AND DAUGHTER lived in IA a brick home that had been painted idlite , a few blocks from the lake . The house glowed in the air of twilight . It had the ghostly weightless look of something at the bottom of a lake , made perfect .

I am not ready to leave this place , and turn toward the wall , hoping that you will stop and whisper that it has all been called off , or that , strangely , I 've returned without incident , without having you sit and shudder for my passage . Outside . I can see the last cafe bring down its metal gate . A man in a white hat leads a girl over the cobblestones . Only one light , at the taxi stand , stands off the assault of bugs . Only one driver leans on his numbered car . Only he and I are awake now , and Igo with one bag , to offer it to him . to deliver myself of it , to ride unburdened in scented air , coffined in the drone of his car , moving as if we would glide on water , toward other lights , where I would deliver up all tickets .

My eyes still insist that I have not left you here . I try to come out of it , waiting for your whisper to send me again into sleep . The melancholy bells repeat themselves . I have not prepared . I have gone too soon . It was a place in which Lawrence might si soundly , as he had never slept in his parents , over sized , combative home in Philadelphia . No rito of that life ! He had blocked out even the rnmi of that life . or , Behind him in the city were his patients and th , unhappy memories of his patients . Ten . sornettrtit twelve hours of ailments  --  the shame of being srtL of being weak , of uttering words better left unsai:1 : Office hours were worse than hospital hours .

They were blotched or sullen impatient or , like Altman 's , familiar but eerily tant , demanding something Lawrence could give and could not understand . Many of the ailments were imaginary .

When he U IS MOTHER IS COMING TO VISIT , due the ' morning on the nine-thirty flight from P delphia , Beverly and Edie are going out again : they in each other 's way by the closet . Edie , fourt years old and taller than her mother , sticks h arms angrily into her coat . The coat is khaki-colo and lined with fake wool , years old ; Edie will n give it up in spite of her mother 's pleas . Lawr stands with the evening newspaper , watching th It is six-thirty . " Do you have to go out now ? " says . " I forgot to get new towels . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't let her use old ones , " Beverly says . " New towels ? You 're towels ?

It is obvious to Lawrence that Rs* and daughter have been arguing about sometil ? Edie knocks against a chair in the foyer and so up her face . " God ! " she winces . " Did you go shopping downtown today ? " rence asks his wife . She is frowning into her purse , looking for thing . " No . " " I thought I saw you . " " Saw me ? When ? " " A little before noon . " B4 She stares at him , closing her purse . There is a oold , bright look around her eyes , a look Lawrence can not understand . Then she smiles . " Oh , yes , I was downtown .

" , lou 're making too much out of it . My mother does n't expect you to fuss over her . " She shakes her head and avoids his eye . He think , of the tall , silver-haired man with the birthmark. hurrying along after her as if to catch up with her . is MOTHER . THE AIRPORT . They have met his " mother like this many times and each time they say the same things : it seems that the same crowds are at the airport . His mother begins at once to tell him about the news at home and she will continue to tell him of funerals and weddings , births , , surgery , illnesses , surprises , all the way home , though the has written him about these things in her weekly letters . " Oh , look at this ! " she says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see her white gloves , which are soiled and even stained with something that looks like rust or blood , a very faint red-brown color . " I 'll wash them out for you , Mother , " Beverly says at once . " Traveling is so dirty . Filthy , " Lawrence 's mother says . He recalls her having said that before . While his mother and his wife talk , Lawrence drives in silence . He 's happy that his mother is visiting them . She comes often , several times a year . Lawrence has the idea that she blames him for having left Philadelphia and coming to this city of strangers , where he has no relatives . The letters they write to each other do not seem to express them . Beneath his neat , typed lines , and beneath her slanted lines in their lavender ink , there seems *be another dimension , a submerged feeling or memory , that the two of them can only hint at but can not express . They are approaching Lawrence 's home . " I like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always es . This seems to settle something . Lawrence and Reverly both feel relieved . The old family home had been white also .

There , 4be bundles of journals . Small towers . He spent ' Y hours looking through them . fascinated . is mother 's presence in his house , his own house , makes Lawrence feel a little displaced . It seems to him that time is confused . His own age is uncertain . But he is a good host to her , helping Beverly out : he is gallant to her . After dinner that night they look through snapshots , another ritual . The snapshots are passed around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stiff motion that makes him realize how his mother is corseted  --  his wife , also , her body slim and deft but smoothly hard to the touch  --  she hands him a photograph that had been taken years ago . That photograph again ! It is Lawrence , Larry Jr. , sitting on a spotted pony at some forgotten fair , a rented pony , Lawrence 's dark hair combed down onto his forehead in a way that makes him look like a moron , his stare startled and vacuous , his mouth too timid to smile . Lawrence stares at the photograph . Why does his mother treasure it so much ? Why does she always bring it along with the more recent snapshots , as if she does n't remember she has shown it to him on her last visit ? " Look at that , is n't that darling ? A darling boy ? " she says stubbornly . Lawrence stares down at his own face , which is blank and stark in the photograph . It was a face that might have become anything . Any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that face  --  anything could inhabit it . He stands suddenly . His mother and his wife stare at him in alarm . " Larry ? What 's wrong ? " Beverly says . He passes his hand over his eyes . He sits down again . " Nothing . " " Did you hear something in the house ? " " No . Nothing . " Two evenings later he is driving home when a car veers out around him , passing him with its horn blaring . The car is filled with kids  --  boys and girls ? and he thinks he sees Edie in with them . His heart jumps . But he can not be sure . When he gets home it is nearly dark . His mother kisses him on the side of the face . She is powdery and yet hard , a precise , stubborn little woman . What do they talk about all day . women ? His mother and his wife ? They are telling him now about what they have done today . Their chatter is like music , rising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never quite completes itself ; it has to continue . " Is Edie home yet ? " he says . " No , not yet , " says Beverly . " Where is she ? " " She had something after school  --  choir practice ? " " All this time ? " " No , not all this time . She 's probably at someone 's house . She 'll be home in a few minutes . " " But you do n't know where she is ? " " Not exactly . What 's wrong ? Why are you so angry ? " " I 'm not angry . " 85 When she comes in he will find out nothing from her . Nothing . She will move her body jerkily through the kitchen and to the front closet , she will take off her coat , she will sit slouching at dinner and stare down into her plate or stare dutifully up at him , and he will find out nothing about her , nothing . His heart pounds angrily . Once Beverly said of Edie , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should see her neck  --  she never washes ! I could roll the dirt off her neck with my fingers ! " His mother asks him about his day . Did he work hard ? Is he tired ? He answers her vaguely , listening for Edie to come in . But when she does come in he will find out nothing from her . His mother switches to another topic  --  complaints about one of his aunts  --  and he ca n't follow her . He is thinking of Edie , then he is thinking of his wife . Then he finds himself thinking of one of his patients , Connie Altman . She wept in his office that morning . " I need something to help me sleep at night . I lie awake thinking . Then in the morning I ca n't remember what I was thinking about . I 'm so nervous , my heart pounds . can you give me something stronger to help me sleep ? Everything is running out . .

" I need something to help me sleep . Please . I know that in the other room he is awake , he ca n't sleep either , it drives me crazy ! I prefer the nights he stays out . At least he is n't in the house , lying awake like me , I do n't care who he 's with . .. I need something to help me sleep , please . I ca n't stand my thoughts all night long .

Two of the three dresser drawers are pulled out . The top of the dresser is cluttered . Lawrence 's reflection moves into the mirror and he looks at himself in surprise  --  is that really him . Dr. Pryor ? He is disappointed . He is even a little angry . His soul is neat , neatly defined as the many cards he carries in his wallet , and as neat as the curve of his haircut against his neck ; neat as his files at the office and as his car , which he takes pride in . But his body looks untidy  --  the shirt rumpled , though he has put it on fresh only that morning  --  his face sallow , edgy , his hands strangely empty . Is that really Dr. Pryor , that man ?

Ted Albrecht , a friend of many years , is talking s usual fanciful manner . He is a stockbroker bethinks of himself as a social critic . A short man , glasses and lively eyebrows ; he is considered with a friend of Lawrence 's , and yet the two men have never talked together , alone together .

The ice cubes in his glass make him think of the Arctic  --  pure crystal , pure colorless ice and air , where no germs survive . It is impossible , this minute . Impossible to stand with these people . He does not know what is wrong and yet he understands that it has become impossible , that his body is being pushed to the breaking point , that to contain himself  --  his physicalness , his being  --  would take the strength of wrestler , a man not himself .

The visit is concluded . I IIOUGII IT WAS A WEEKDAY EVENING , they went to Dorothy Clair 's art gallery , where a young sculptor was having an opening . Dorothy Clair was a widow some years older than the Pryors , a wealthy woman on the periphery of their social group . It was a champagne opening . Lawrence and his wife were separated , drawn into different groups ; Lawrence was not really taking part in the conversation , but he appeared enthusiastic . The champagne went to his head . His mother had stayed with them for nearly a week , the visit had gone well , everything was over . Good . It was a weekday evening but they had gone out as if to reward themselves .

Great massive hulks  --  not defined enough to be shapes  --  squatted on the floor . People drifted around the sculpture , sometimes bumping into it .

But no one else seemed to be uneasy . He went to examine the wire  --  it looked like chicken wire  --  and he could make no sense of it . Elsewhere in the crowded room there were balls of metal that were distorted , like planets wrenched out of shape . Their shiny surfaces reflected a galaxy of human faces , but the faces were not really human . They were cheerful and blatant and flat , as if there were no private depths to them .... How they were all chattering away , those faces ! No privacy at all , nothing but the facial mask of flesh : no private depths @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faces were all talking earnestly to one another . Lawrence looked for his wife . He saw her across the room , talking to a tall man with silvery hair . It was the man he had seen downtown ! Astonished . Lawrence could not move . He stood with his drink in his hand , as metallic and fixed as the pieces of sculpture . These columns punctuated the gallery , each reaching to the ceiling , with flat , shiny surfaces and edges that appeared razor-sharp . They made him think suddenly of the furniture in his parents ' house that he had stood up on end , as a child  --  allowed by his mother to play with the furniture of certain rooms , upending tables and chairs so that he could crawl under them and pretend they were small houses , huts . He had crouched under them , peering out past the legs of tables and chairs .

Why had he come down hwe If he were to drown , perhaps scenes of his past% would flash to him . He would see the upended furifi. lure again  --  the clumsy gold-covered chair with its curved legs and its gauzy bottom , the springs visible through the dark gauze  --  he would crawl between the legs again , drawing his knees up to his chest , hiding there , sly and safe .

She took his trench coat from him , shook it , hung it up . In the waiting room  --  he could see through two partly opened doors  --  a few people were sitting and had been sitting for a while .
