from overseas Strange put it out of his mind . Still she was , as some forthright , bathrobe-clad Government Issue had said , eminently fuckable . Some female thing about her every movement said so , and her shy self-awareness of her sex in front of so many male eyes underlined it . Her one kooky eye that kept looking off in a wrong direction half the time made her even sexier . For some odd screwball reason . Strange had paid attention when she seemed interested in Landers , and thought , that all right and in keeping with the fact that they were both college people . But when in Landers ' absenceshe attached herself to Mart Winch twenty years her senior , Strange 's mind balked . When he saw them together in town up at the Plantation Roof on the top of the Peabody Hotel , sitting together right in front of everybody , Strange was suddenlyintensely jealous . If he had known she went for older fellows , he would gladly have offered himself . Only , he had n't . Leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and sop up the gravy . Up to now , Strange had studiously avoided other women in Luxor . He felt he owed that to Linda . But it was not nearly so easy to do as it sounded . It required more effort not to pick up women in town in Luxor than it did to meet them and take them out and screw them . The city was full of unattached women . Riveters . Welders . Lathe operators . All sorts of minor assemblylineworkers . And all of them hellbent on picking up some in-transit serviceman for a one-night stand or one-week fling . Since their work shifts ran right on around the clock , it was just as easy to run into one at eight o'clock in the morning as in the evening . A lot of them did n't work at all , had quit it , or had never done it , and just went on and on , from one party to another , from one hotel suite to another hotel suite . It was hard work not to pick them up , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Strange had resisted . He had been homehome ?  --  toCincinnati one further tune after his second trip while Bobby Prell was mending . Making a total of three visits in all . He had not found anything there had much changed . Linda Sue was just as cold and indifferent to his bedroom advancesas she had been the first time . Though she never turned him down when he asked . But Strange found it harder and harder to ask with any real excitement . He found it easier to justp177roll over and go to sleep . Or go downstairs to that never-vacant kitchen and drink more beer . Maybe at the age of twenty-eight he was outgrowing sex excitement . The way his parents had done . He only knew that for the marriage and their dream of a restaurant to be maintained required fidelity . On both sides , his as well as hers . So when his jealousy and envy of Winch with Carol Firebaughcame up in him so strong , it came as a shock . Obviously , he badly wanted to fuck her himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Carol , he began to see it in him for others , in other places . That he did not do anything about it was mostly due to his feelings about Linda and the restaurant and their savings . But it was also due to his concern and preoccupation with the final medical status of his hand wound . All through the business of I'rell 's legs Strange had waited for some word from Col Curran about his own disposition and first operation . But every day at morning rounds the surgeon would only look at the hand , move it a little , and ask how Strange was doing . Strange had tried to stay with Curran 's instructions about forcing himself to use the hand , even when it hurt and he did not want to . Finally he was obliged to tell Curran it hurt almost too much . Curran nodded , silently pursing up his mouth as if about to whistle , with that polite interested look on his face , and told him to stop using it . Then about a week after the big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Winch had received his absurdly unjustified Purple Heart , Curran had stopped by his bed at morning rounds and without even looking at the hand had told him he wanted to see him in his office beside the three big surgeries at twelve o'clock that same day . Strange had been planning on spending the day in town after morning rounds . But there was no begging off from a summons like this one . Curran was as immaculate as usual , with his starched doctor 's smock and scrubbed hands , behind his little desk in the cubbyholeoffice . But his face looked tired and wan and in the corner an open GI laundry bin overflowed with what looked like bloody surgeon 's aprons . " I 'm sorry about those , " Curran said with his bright almostp178lipless smile . " They were supposed to pick them up . But of course they have n't done it . " " Blood does n't bother me , " Strange said . " I 've seen a lot of it , Doc . " " I expect you have . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a moment . " You 've had a pretty heavy work schedule today , hunh ? " Strange said . " Yes , " Curran said . " Now . About your hand . " " Yes , sir . " In a ridiculous way , Strange felt responsible for not upsetting Curran . He did n't want to do anything that might tire or distress the surgeon . He listened while Curran went over it all . Every now and then as he talked Curran 's hands moved the papers about on his desk aimlessly . " I 've probably given you more loose time than was good for your hand . This hand of yours is a ticklish piece of business . But I could n't help it , " he said , looking up . " We 've had a heavy schedule of operations lately , and this hand of yours is a pretty delicate thing to operate . There are an awful lot of ligaments in there that ca n't be nicked or cut . In any case , I 'm prepared to do the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his swivel chair . " We 'll go in and take out the metal fragment first . And I 'll see how it looks in there . I probably wo n't try to do anything about the bone growth this time . Unless I see that it looks easy . I have no reason to expect that it will look easy . " I want to get at you early in the morning while I 'm still fresh . So I 'm going to have them give you a mild enema tonight , and a sedative . You wo n't get any breakfast in the morning . They 'll probably wake you around six . All right ? " " Yes , sir , " Strange said and grinned . He felt a necessity to make it a tough grin . Then he added , " Uh , sir . Will it be all right if I go see my buddies tonight ? At the snack bar ? " Curran nodded slowly . " It will be all right . But I do n't want you drinking any coffee , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You know , you people amaze me . You 're really as thick as a bunch of fleas , are n't you ? " He placed the tips of his fingers together and stared at Strange over them . Strange stared back at him , suddenly irritated . It was n't any of Curran 's business how thick they were . What was he picking at now ? And why ? Strange ran his tongue judiciously over his teeth before framing an answer.  | " Well , sir . I guess we are , " he said slowly . " We been through a lot of shit together . But probably more than that , you got to remember we come out of an old Regular Army outfit together . Do n't forget , we spent like two to three years together . Before we ever got into this war . We know each other pretty good . " He stopped , debating whether to go on and tell the surgeon more . But immediately something in him decided not to tell more to Curran . It was an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surgeon who was going to cut on him tomorrow or no . " Well , I 'll see you tomorrow morning , " Curran said , and swung his chair back up level . " But you probably wo n't notice it . They 'll be giving you a light injection tomorrow , to calm you down a little . Before they roll you in . " Outside , Strange felt distinctly peculiar , as he made his way back to his ward . He felt as he used to feel when he boxed , or played football . Suddenly he felt he had to piss . Though he knew his bladder was empty . He headed back in his issue bathrobeto find Winch and Landers and Prell and tell them the news . Winch , of course , did not show up that evening . He was out with his little girlfriend . Could n't stay away , could n't get enough of her , likely . When Strange went by to tell him at 12:45 lie had just barely caught him , all dressed in uniform to go to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , that Winch was finally wearing those brand-new 1st/sgt 's stripes of his . That was what a woman would do for you , he thought to himself wryly . Landers and Prell did show up . At the snack bar . Landers limping and with his cane . Prell in his wheelchair : with new , white casts on his legs , in which now his knees had been slightly bent . " My knees are what are going to do me in , " he told them . " I ca n't even move them . Christ , they 're like a couple of rusty old , seized-up , frozen , door hinges . " Prell , of course , was n't going anyplace off hospital . So it was not such an effort for him to arrange to be at the snack bar to see Strange . It was a big event for him . Landers , though , had clearly missed a date in town , to lie with his old mess sgt on the night before his operation . St range , who had never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for him . Prell , though he could not get off hospital grounds to go in town , had not been wasting his time . They found out as they talked that he had found himself a girlfriend . Right on his own ward.  | " Hell , yes , " he grinned at them . " She 's some sweet little countrygirl from some little town just outside of Luxor . Her daddy 's off overseas somewhere so her and her momma come into town every day to volunteer as Gray Ladies out here . I ai nt met her momma . But she got assigned to our ward , so every afternoon she spends the whole afternoon reading to me . She 's reading me Treasure Island , right now . " Prell 's eyes sparkled , as he laughed for them . " She thinks I 'm the cat 's meow . Big Medal of Honor winner . I ca n't do much of nothing yet . I could n't fuck , with these legs . But I 'll give anybodyten for five I 'll have her blowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ month 's out , " he added smiling . " Or at least tossing me off . " But when they mentioned Winch , Prell 's face got stiff and frozen . He refused even to mention Winch 's name , nor would he talk about or listen to anything about him . Landers , when Strange asked him , apparently did not mind that Mart Winch had taken over his Red Cross girl . " More power to him , " he said . There were more women in town than you could beat off with a ball bat . " If he can get into her , good for him . " Landers had been back to see his new acquaintance , the Naval lieutenant commander Jan Mitchell , who kept the suite at the Peabody . Apparently there was a party there every night . " Those Navy flyers , " Landers said , " and Army flyers . They do n't give a damn whether you 're an enlisted man or not . They do n't pull rank . As long as you 're fun at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when Prell was finally able to get around , to come up there with him . Strange accepted tentatively . But he was n't thinking about that as much as about the operation . He sat and talked with them until the snack bar closed . He promised Landers he would go down to the Peabody in a week or so . Before they separated outside the darkened snack bar , and went off along the dimly lighted walkways to their wards , Strange shook hands with both of them warmly . Since they both went the same way toward the leg wards , Landers hung his cane on the back of Prell 's wheelchairand pushed it along leaning on it with his limp . Strange stood looking after them as they dimmed and darkened and then brightened under the series of overhead lights . They caused his swallowing mechanism to choke up , and made a lump come in his throat.  |p181As  he turned toward his own ward his stomach flipped over and he had that sensation of needing to piss again . In the morning that was all they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let him get out of bed , but passed him a glass duck to use . Then the guy was pricking his arm with the injection . In the operating room the anesthetist went right to work on him . Curran , already in a gauze mask and white cap , smiled with his eyes and winked and explained about the sodium pentothol the anesthetist was letting into his vein . Counting backward Strange got from ten to six before there was a sudden vast explosion of terrible-tasting fumes in the roof of his mouth . He tried to shake his head , but no longer had one . Coming out of it , there was a lot of noise , and huge flashing revolving lights like artillery searchlights . They flashed on in a brilliant white glare , and then off in a darkness the eyes had no time to adjust to . But if it was an air raid , why were they blinking ? Then it was n't an air raid , but a grand court , and at the far end a huge figure shrouded all in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ huge white marble base . In the flashinglights , seeing it all in broken lines as if reflected in a splinteredmirror , Strange stood and waited in front of all the crowds . Until the white figure , its face covered , slowly extended one huge arm , the index finger pointing . There was a vast sigh of " Ah ! " from the crowd and Strange knew that he had lost . Whatever it was . Whatever it was that was at stake . Then he realized that someone , the anesthetist , was talking , shouting at him , in capital letters . " THERE WE GO , THERE WE GO , HE 'S ALL RIGHT . SURE . HE 'S ALL RIGHT . YOU 'RE ALL RIGHT . THERE , NOW . " The anesthetist was smilingat him . Strange managed to wink at him but the white figure still filled his mind , more real than any of the reality around him and it stayed with him all the groggy way back to the ward rolling along the corridors on the meat wagon and it stayed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partially doped up . It stayed sharply between his eyeballs and everything he looked at . Curran was not one to be stingy with dope and painkillers when somebody was in pain . When he stopped by that first afternoon to see him , he said he did not believe with Maj Hogan and Col Baker that standing pain was the essence of a man . Strange only nodded and looked at him and smiled , seeing inp182front of him that great white figure and pointing arm . Curran still seemed less real . It had had a profound effect on him , the dream . Or vision . Or whatever it was . It seemed so real it took on the quality of a revelation almost . But what was it supposed to mean ? All Strange knew was that , somewhere , he had been tried and found wanting . But he did not even know what the trial was for . He had the feeling that in the vision he had not been told , either . He had simply been judged . No defense . It did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dream he had felt a great sense of guilt , and then relief . An enormous sorrow , and relief . Relief that at last somebody knew . Vaguely now , but sharply in the vision , he had the feeling he was being sent back somewhere he had hoped to be allowed to leave . That was what the silent finger seemed to indicate : you are sent back , and must stay . But Strange did not know sent back to where . Even when he was back on his feet and the painkillers withdrawn , the powerful image of the white figure and pointing arm would not leave him and he could not get away from the feeling that he was being told something . In the fact of it and because the painkillers they gave him were n't all that strong , he was not off his feet all that long . On Curran 's orders , the ward attendants had him up and out of bed and moving around the ward before the afternoon of the first day was over . Curran did not like to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plate made and bandaged underneath the hand so that only the knuckle joints themselves were held immobile . Curran maintained that casts had caused more cripples than the wounds that had required their use . " We 're such a long , long way from what we could do in surgeryand orthopedics , " he said with his mild smile . " God only knows how long it 's going to take . And only God knows what lovely advances will come out of this beautiful war . " Curran 's eyebrows hooked upward over his pale eyes . Then , sitting on the bed edge , he turned and with a sharp twinkling grin asked Strange to come out with him sometime and have a few drinks , and to bring his buddies . Strange said that he would . Strange did not know what had caused him to take such an interest in the four of them . Probably it was the saving of Prell'sp183legs . " That first sergeant of yours , Winch , must be quite a guy , " Curran said . " What he did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him are really something . I 'd like to meet him . " Strange said he would try to arrange it . He did not know what Curran meant by the way Winch " arranged that medal . " But he did n't really care . He already knew pretty much what Winch would say . Which was a flat No . He and Winch saw pretty much eye to eye about officers . Officers were of a different caste , and ought to stay there . But of course he and Winch were old Regulars . And this was the wartime Army . Full of civilians . Strange made up his mind privately that he would not even mention the invitation to Winch , and that he would not take it up himself , either . He liked Curran , more and more , and admiredhim , but he did not intend ever to become a buddy of his . He felt exactly the same about the officers at the Hotel Peabodywhen Landers took him there . Because of Col Curran 's postoperative treatment he was able to go much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instead of a week . Curran told him only that he should be careful of the hand . " When you 're on top of some girl , " Curran grinned , " make sure you support yourself on the plaster plate on your palm . Not on your finger knuckles . " Strange had only grunted . He had no intention of picking up some woman . And yet , when he got there , he found himself in bed with one almost before he had time to get a few drinks down him . And before the afternoon and after it the evening were over he had been to bed with four different women . Of course so had Landers . But he would have expected that of Landers . He would not have expected it of himself . But the operation seemed to have changed him in some deepdownbasic way . Either the operation itself , or perhaps it was that damned vision or dream or revelation or whatever it was he had had coming out of the anesthetic . Being strapped down and put to sleep and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a part of you to try and repair it could do a lot of damage to a man 's self-esteem . And Strange could not shake off the picture of the judging figure , its hand pointing . And he could n't shake off the way it made him feel . There had been no anger or frustration or outrageat the figure . No crying of unfair . You could no more be outraged at the figure than you could be outraged at the universe . Both were there , both existed , it was the way things were.  |p184It  had to be accepted . In the dream he had felt a compassion . Compassion for himself and for everything . He had always been compassionate . Why else would the old company nick-name him " Mother Strange . " But this new compassion was different and deeper and included everything in God 's created universe . And yet deep underneath it in him was an indigestible despair . And way down deep under the despair was a fiery-red , sneaky little anger . Over the fact that things must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made him rebellious . His rebelliousness included Linda . If Linda did n't care much about fucking him any more , and probably never had done , Strange guessed that was her privilege . But there were plenty who would . And if some of these excited him , he did n't see why he should n't take advantage of it . He had not felt like that before the operation . But if the white figure had judged against him and pointed him away , back to whatever it was he must go back to , what did he have to lose ? It was silly perhaps , but he was taking the dream quite seriously , in a grinding sort of way . And his sexual proclivities were a long way from being washed up , as he had thought two weeks ago . None of that had anything to do with his commitment and loyalty to Linda Sue , and her crazy defense-plant family , and her dream restaurant . He would stand by that . Thus Strange sat and figured it out for himself with a drink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smoke-filled , booze-fumed sitting room of the Peabody hotel suite Landers had brought him to , before swiftly becoming entangled and intertwined with his first female body of the afternoon . He realized there was some question whether he had chosen it , or it had chosen him . The place was so crowded a certain protocol had to be followed . The suite had a bedroom on either side of the sitting room . With doors that closed . The sitting room had a double bed . So the management could rent that room singly , if needed . This bed was a necking , feel-them-up way station while waiting for a bedroom , and couples were always sprawled on it . You were supposed to note how many couples were already there waiting when you got on the bed , and to keep track of your place in the lineup . Both bedrooms had single cot beds placed against the wall inp185addition to their big beds , so that each bedroom could accommodatetwo couples when a serious party was in progress , like today . Propriety demanded neither couple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while at play themselves . Strange , when he entered a bedroom the first time , found it impossible not to stop and stare . " Hey . You 're not supposed to look , " the girl welder who was with him cried cheerily . " No . You 're not , " a muffled voice said from the cot . The girl welder added , " You 're supposed to look only at me . " The third of the four women he took to bed during the afternoonand the evening wanted him to go down on her , make her come by licking her pussy . She was willing , more than willing , to go down on him , too . Her name was Frances Highsmith . She was a metal lathe operator , had dropped out of Washington University in St. Louis to do war work after her brother was killed in the Air Force over England , and made Strange think a little bit of Carol Firebaugh . Which was why he had singled her out . Years before Strange might have slapped her in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now he only smiled and refused . Politely . " What 's the matter ? " Frances said . " Have n't you ever eaten cunt before ? " " No , " Strange said . " No , I have n't . " " You mean you think it 's dirty ? Filthy ? Perverted ? Something like that ? " Frances demanded . " A perversion ? " They were on the narrow cot bed this time , lying side by side , and Strange could feel his heated erection beating with his heartbeat against her slim belly . " I guess so , " he said . " Something like that . " " Boy , have you got a lot to learn , " Frances Highsmith said . " I 've heard about fellows like you . But I did n't think I 'd meet one up here . " Strange felt irritated . " Well . It 's the same thing as being queer . Is n't it . " " Queer ? " Frances Highsmith said . " Queer ? " She peered at him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Did n't you ever watch dogs ? It would be queer if I went down on a girl . Or if you went down on a boy . But it 's not queer for boys and girls together . " Well , have n't you ever even thought about it ? In a fantasy ? " " No , I never have . " " Hey , listen . Are you married ? "  | " Yes , " Strange said stiffly . " Boy , am I sorry for your wife . How do you think women come ? " " I 've never thought about it . " " Wow . You never even thought about it ? " Frances said . " Well , maybe I better explain it to you . You know what a clitoris is ? " " Sure . " " Are you sure ? It 's a woman 's penis . Women come from stimulating that . They do n't come from having cocks shoved into them . " She stopped . " Well , maybe a few do . But it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .  --  You sure you do n't want to try it ? " " No . No doubt in my mind , " Strange said . " Well , I think there 's something seriously wrong with you . " " Listen , " a muffled male voice said from the other bed . " If youtwo want to argue philosophy , will you kindly do it outside ? " " You shut up , " Frances said . " But do n't let that stop you , " Strange said . " No , " Frances said . " Oh , no . No , sir . Let 's just fuck . I 'll find somebody else to come with later . I 'm not going to blow some fellow that wo n't blow me . " " Well , fuck him then , honey , and shut up , " a muffled female voice said from the big bed . " I guess she 's right , " Frances said . " If we 're going to do anything at all , we better get on with it . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For everything but licking you . " She had already turned flat on her back , and now she made a practiced little sideways motion that seemed to slide her right under him , legs apart , like a card in a deck . Like the burn card going onto the bottom of a poker deck . Later on , later in the evening , he saw her going off with Landers . He wondered if Landers would make her come by licking her pussy for her . Maybe Landers might , he was an educated college boy . Well , every man to his own taste . Like many another boy , Strange had stared heatedly and hungrilyat all the photographs and drawings of wide-open vaginas that were available just about everywhere across America in his youth . He had sat and watched the stag films that always , somehowor other , found their way to all the NCO clubs across the country . But all the photos of wide-open pussies had never destroyedthe ultimate mystery of woman for him . Nothing hadp187ever destroyed the mystery of women for him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sometimes he wished something had . But grown men did not get down and lick women 's cunts . That was just as much a perversion as being a fag . It was sick in the head . The truth was he had never even seen Linda Sue 's pussy wide-open . Or closed for that matter . He 'd seen her naked . But my God , what would Linda Sue say , if he asked her to let him see her pussy wide-open ? Or asked her to let him lick it ? He could n't imagine it . The trouble with women was when you had had them you still had n't had them . He had had four , and had n't had any . He was right back where he started before he came up here , only now he was lonelier than he was before . While Landers was off with Frances Highsmith , he told somebody to tell Landers he would be back , and went off down to the setups bar off the lobby before they closed it at midnight , and sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place was jammed with servicemen drinking . And of course with women . But no matter how many women there were , anywhere , there were always more servicemen , lonely , looking . The bar had them all the way from bald grizzled old Navy chief petty officers in whites with hash marks all the way up to their shoulders , to boys in the ill-fitting unworn uniforms of the newly drafted . Strange felt more at home here with them . Once , upstairs  --  it was while he was lying on the way-station bed in the sitting room waiting with his fourth friend of the day  --  he had looked around at everybody standing and drinking and shouting and singing ; and suddenly the mud-weary , eye-baggy , scared platoons of the company appeared before him in ghostly form , slogging away at the swampy jungle of New Georgia . And briefly , crazily , Strange wished he was back with them . You had to be crazy to wish you were back in a place like that . But as he sat in the downstairs bar and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that was where he wished he was . With a kind of horrified , aghast longing , he pictured their faces one by one , all of them more sharp , more detailed , more clear , than any of the faces he had seen since . Or before . When they locked down the bar at twelve , he took his bottle and went back upstairs to collect Landers and go back out to the hospital . He did n't collect him , of course . Landers was still making out ,  |p188or  flirting , with one woman after another . As the night wore on and people dwindled away , finally there was left only a tight hard-core little group of drunken male singers , with whom he and Landers sang drunkenly for a while , all the old songs . Nobodyin the hotel ever complained about noise , to anyone 's knowledge . At five-thirty with dawn coming up across the plains in the east they left to go back and sleep just enough to sober up before morning rounds . In the taxi Landers gabbled and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days later , from Curran , Strange had the deposition of his surgical status . The upshot of it was that Curran simply did not know what to do . It was possibly the best news Strange could have been given , if he had selected his own . Curran switched on the little light screen and put the X-rays up for him to see . " See where those knots are ? All ligaments and tendons in there . Very ticklish . I do n't honestly know if I can do it for you . So I 'm not recommending the operation . You will have to decideif you want it done . " " And if I do n't ? " Curran shrugged . A strange quiet smile came over his face . " Then I 'll recommend you for a disability discharge . That wo n't set too well with Maj Hogan and Col Baker . But they ca n't overrule me . " " And if I do want it ? " Curran shrugged again . " I wo n't promise . If it works , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duty . If you 're lucky . So I guess it all depends on whether you want to stay in the service . You 're a thirty-year man , are n't you ? If it does n't work , you wo n't be any worse off than you are . You 'll have about the same partial use of the hand . But the two middle knuckles will be partly frozen in a slightly different way than they are now . It 's up to you to decide . " " Are you trying to give me some kind of an out if I want out of the service ? " Strange said . " No . Not at all . I 'm presenting you with the proper medical prognosis . I know the Army wants men , all the men it can save , and preferably trained men . You 're a trained man . But I ca n't let that override a proper medical decision . " " Can I have a few days to think it over ? " " Sure . All the time you want . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . "  |p189Suddenly  , he held his surgeon 's hands up between his face and Strange 's , and flexed them . " I know a lot about hands . " " You 've been pretty square with me , Colonel , " Strange said . " And I want to thank you for it . " " I 'm a doctor , " Curran said . " I was a doctor before I was a colonel in the Army . " " Which is more than you can say for some , " Strange said . " I 'll get back to you soon , sir . " Somehow he felt like saluting . It was n't much of a salute , with the plaster plate still on his hand . Then he went to find Winch and see if Winch would fix it up with his pal Jack Alexander to arrange another consecutive double three-day pass to go up to Cincinnati and talk it over with Linda . When he saw Winch , he thought Winch looked better than he had seen him look in quite a long time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left Wahoo for the Canal . More relaxed , less acid , less hard-faced . The little girl was apparently quite good for him.  |p190Johnny  Stranger 's request for passes was no trouble for Winch . Some time back , Jack Alexander had given him a big stack of blank pass forms , already signed , so that all he had to do was fill in the name , and the dates . " These are for you . And any your people you think deserve them , " Alexander had rasped in his scarred voice , the day after the medals presentation . " Use them any way you want . " Winch scribbled out two of them for Strange , over Col Stevens ' neat signature . Both men knew it was impossible for Strange to get up to Cincinnati and back on any ordinary threedaypass . Strange had told Winch about the operation . But as the stocky mess/sgt walked away down the ward something about the set of his shoulders said that everything was not as straightforwardas Strange had made it sound . Winch would not have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had looked since the Division left Oahu . But Winch was certainly feeling better than he had felt since Doc Harris shipped him out of New Georgia . There was no doubt in Winch 's mind that this was due to thep191appearance of Carol in his life . He could hardly believe his own luck . An old man like him . Before he 'd picked her up ( or been picked up by her , he could never be sure which ) he had been suffering one of the lowest points of his life . Even the long nights on the line in Guadalcanaland New Georgia had not . been as bad as ' this hospital halflifeat Kilrainey General . And then , they had received yet another casualty into Kilraineyfrom the old company , and this had nearly done him in . The medical stuff was bad enough . The heart failure attack had left him with what the docs called a left bundle branch block . They had had hopes the block would disappear with treatment . But more and more the docs at Kilrainey had come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impairment . Weakness , shortness of breath , the inability to run , or carry weight , or do any but the lightest exercise . In the past month he had lost the initial feeling of total fragility he had had in the beginning . But Winch had always been a strong man physically , and depended on that as one source of his authority . Without it he felt helpless . His need for diuretics was part of the same thing . The weakenedheart muscle could not pump the blood through strongly . This caused a back pressure to build up behind the heart , between the heart and kidneys . The back pressure aided the heart , but caused the kidneys to function at less than full efficiency . The edema came from that , and tied Winch as tightly and securelyto the hospital as if he had been tied to it with a rope . He was getting one big intramuscular injection of mercurial diuretica day . Even if later they could lower the dosage , they could never eliminate it altogether . If he had not had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then he would find himself among the living dead in some Veterans ' Hospital , tied to it as he was now tied to Kilrainey , for his daily shot . A great future to look forward to . And into all of this there was suddenly dropped onto him the new casualty . It was like some giant 's hand steam iron falling from the sky , flattening Winch . There was no reason for them not to expect newer casualtiesfrom the company . Men wounded after Winch left but before the campaign ended had continued to drift home . Even though the fighting in New Georgia had ended ap192month before . But Staff/Sgt Billy Stonewall Dodson Spencer was a special case . Partly Billy was special because of the bad way he 'd been wounded . Partly he was special because of what he told them about the company . But partly Billy was special simply by the very fact he was a staff/sgt . That alone said a great deal about the state of the company . When Winch had left the company , Billy Spencer had just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot to do with his promotion , had assured himself that was as high as Billy could ever rise . Now here Billy was , not only a staff/sgt and former squad leader . He had been promoted platoon guide of the second platoon shortly before getting hit . What Billy told them about the company bore out the amazingfact of his promotion . Letters from the company had been getting scarcer and scarcer since the end of the New Georgia campaign , and recently there had been none . Billy was the first uncensored news any of them had had since Winch himself came out . All of them hung on every word he had to say . Winch hung on each one , too . Though he hid this from the others . The upshot of it was , there was n't any old company any more . Only about fifty of the original hundred and eighty remained , most of them pfcs and privates . A few were higher-ranking noncoms . Winch 's old tech/sgt , Zwermann , had not been chosenfor the job of 1st/sgt and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The others , the rest , were replacements . Just green dumbass cannon-fodder draftees . Some of these , the better ones , were now running squads . All the officers had been changed . The old-timers , when they were n't fighting , were drunk all the time . Old Zwermann when he was passed over had tried to turn in his stripes and been refused . Then he had tried to get himself shipped out sick , and been refused that too . Everythingwas being clamped down everywhere . The only way to get out now was to get yourself shot up . Or be so sick you literally were dying . Even shot up , you had to be shot up pretty good . Minor wounds did n't count any more , you could forget it . Many of the draftees were joining the drunks . And the drunks , when they could n't get real booze , were stealing fivegalloncans of peaches and pineapple by the dozen from the ration dumps , sometimes at pistol point , and making illegal swipe and jungle juice out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any company esprit or morale any more . Thep193rumor was that they were going in on Bougainville as soon as the Marines had secured a beachhead . Perhaps they were even going in with the Marines . Almost none of the original noncoms , who had held it all together , were left now . That was why Billy had been promoted . Some squad leader had been killed . Later the second platoon guide was killed . Billy had tried to refuse both promotions , but had not been allowed . In the old days Billy had been a typical happy-go-lucky middle-classboy from Alabama . Now as he lay in his bed and talked with the rest of them clustered around it , it was easy to see his responsibilities as a noncom had completely changed his personality . He had been wounded on a patrol . Taking the point himself , which as platoon guide he did not have to do , he stepped on a Jap land mine which had blown off his one foot halfway up the shin , shattered his other leg , and sprinkled his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also blinded him in both eyes . " Is that you , Top ? " he whispered in a new , hoarse voice , putting out one hand . When he found Winch 's hand , he put his other hand over it and held on to it in both of his . " Is that really you , Top ? I heard on the West Coast you might be here in Luxor , Top . But I never thought I 'd get to see you . " Some of the men still went down to the hospital compound for each unloading when they knew the trucks were bringing in cases from a West Coast train and one of them had spotted Billy on his stretcher and spread the word . When they gathered around his bunk , Winch had been the last to arrive . Winch let him keep the hand . Until Billy saw fit to let go of it himself . Then Winch drifted to the back of the crowd and stood while Billy talked about the company until the nurse came and shooed them all away . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The dumb fuckers . The dumb kid should never have made him into some kind of father . He had never wanted to be a father substituteto fucking dumb kids . In the next days Billy sent for Winch a number of times to come and sit with him . Winch always went . Although all Billy wanted to do was talk about the old company . Which talk Winch hated , of course . As Billy 'd said , there was n't any more old company . But Billy wanted to talk about the good old days back on Guadalcanal , when there had been one , and which days Billy had survived intact . " We had us some great times there , up onp194the line . Did n't we , Top ? " He had somehow got it fixed in his head that Guadalcanal was some kind of a golden-age happy time , compared to New Georgia . He wanted Winch to promise he would meet his father and mother when they finally could come up from Alabama to see him . Each time Winch promised that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a whim almost , Winch took a couple of his own blank pass forms and locked the rest up with the nurse on the ward in a sealed envelope , and went up to St. Louis . St. Louis was where his wife and two brats were . He had to get away somewhere . And when he thought about it , he thought Why not St. Louis ? He did n't even have to see them , if he did n't want to . It was more of a mood projection than the contemplation of an actual journey . Just to be going somewhere , anywhere . To be unknown . To be on the move . To be simply a watcher . With no loyalties and no commitments . He decided to wear one of his shirts that did n't have stripes . Go incognito . The mood was one of floating . Of being bodiless . Unattached to anything , or anybody . Unconcerned . It would be great . Two hours after the idea hit him he was on his way . He had to check it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medication to use in it , take a ten-minute course in how to stick himself in the back of the arm or in the side of the ass , pack a satchel with his medical gear and an extra uniform . It was late afternoon when he was first penetrated by the idea and he arrived at the Luxor Greyhound station just at dusk , as the night trips were beginning . It was not dark enough yet to turn on night lights , but was dark enough to make the eyes scratchy . Things looked indistinct in the thinner outdoor and thicker indoor glooms . People were beginning to move around restlessly , or eat sandwiches they did not really want , in the restiveness that comes with the basic change of light from day to night . It all fit in perfectly with his mood of bodiless disinvolvement . He had no idea what he would do in St. Louis . And did n't care . And in fact , might just as well have been going to Chicago or Detroit . Anyplace where he was not known . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleep . There was a full moon out but he did not look at the night scenery . Only once on the 300-mile trip , at Cape Girardeau , didp195he rouse himself to look out over the big river . He was supremelycontent simply to be and to sit , and feel the motor vibrations and road tire-thumps under his thighs . For the length of time the trip lasted there was nothing in the world Winch wanted . The feeling was so similar to what he had felt in Frisco during the worst part of his heart failure attack , when he had felt another him outside himself , that it set him to brooding over this sense of another self outside . What was it ? He did n't know . Was there really another him outside somewhere waiting to be rejoinedto this part ? He did n't know . Had it been a real sensation , or only his delirious imagination ? He did n't know that . There were in fact no questions Winch could ask himself and give satisfactory answers for . He was left with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet and thighs the big tires thudded and scrambled against the roadway . Billy Spencer had brought back the reality of the boggling , gasping , mud-swallowing platoons in a way that gave the mind a start . Somewhere there was a mistake , because Winch should have been right up there with them , right now . He was too sophisticated to think he could change what was happening to them . But he could have cushioned it and molded it so that someI semblance of the old personality remained . Instead , he was here . And they were floundering . He felt a total failure . Billy 's talking had brought back the violent brutality and gushing insanity of combat in a shocking fashion . It made Winch aware of how strikingly it all had faded . He had never believed that it could fade , all that brutalizing . He had never wanted to be a father substitute for kids like Billy . Where did your responsibility end ? Nowhere , apparently . Never . It never ended . What kind of a thought was that to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seat a young soldier slept like a baby , cradling a Seagram 's whiskey bottle . In St. Louis Winch took a room in one of the hotels in the sleazy section down by the river . He had never served at JeffersonBarracks , but once he had stopped off there to see an old buddy and he knew the area . Whores and pimps and hustlers and muggers walked the crowded streets and hung out in all the low bars . Just as they 'd always done . Naturally , soldiers were everywhere . Once installed , he went straight to bed and slept for sixteenp196hours , all through the next day till eight o'clock at night . When he woke , he shaved and dressed and went out and bought himself a bottle of dry California wine and brought it back with him to the room . Feeling very like a man having a clandestine meeting in a cheap hotel , which in a way he was , he poured half a water-tumblerful and held it up to the light , then took the first sharp , tingling sip . Nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sitting at the cheap desk with his feet up on the bed , he drank the entire bottle , all six sharp , saliva-starting glasses of it . Nothing he had eaten or drunk in a long time tasted as sharp and appetizing and delicious . When it was finished , he went out to eat . He had had no alcohol in so long the wine made him about half drunk for ten or fifteen minutes . It felt marvelous . He did not even mind having to ask the waitress for food cooked without salt . After he had eaten , he walked out into the street and did what he had known he was going to do all along . He flagged a cab and gave the driver his wife 's address out in the western part of the city . Winch had never seen the house , or the street . She had moved to St. Louis , after Winch left her for overseas , because her father the old master/sgt had retired there before he died . She had cousins there , she said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sections of the city . The streets were in square blocks and shaded by big trees . The houses were big and square-shoulderedand thick-waisted . They seemed to stand in row after row for miles , like hundreds of old rotund master/sgts in ranks on parade . There was a tin panel with four apartment doorbell buttons let into the wood beside the door . The big old residence had been converted . Hers was the second floor left . From across the street , under the shade of an old large-leafed soft maple in the soft September night air , Winch set up his vigil and began to wait . After an hour and a half , when he had begun to think she must already be home and in bed , a taxi drove up and Winch watched her get out with a serviceman . By his cap the man was an officer and a flyer . Wings and some fruit salad were visible above his left pocket . The round white insignia of a It/col glinted from his shoulders in the street lamp . Both of them looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their way up the short walk to the steps . At the door the man kissed her deeply , before she got out her key and opened the door . In a couple of minutes lights went onp197in the second floor left , and did not go out . The taxi had driven off . Under his maple Winch set himself to wait another half hour . The lights did not go off . Nobody came out . He supposed the two brats were asleep in their own room . That was where they used to be . What the hell , they were ten and eleven now . Old enough to take care of themselves when mommy went out for the evening . After the half hour was up and there was no change , he started walking toward where he thought the nearest main thoroughfare ought to be . It took quite a while . Winch walked slowly , and took his time , and did not get any shortness of breath . He thought he remembered the route the cab had taken but apparently he did n't . Finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , walked toward them to a traffic avenue and hailed a cab . Back in the riverfront section he walked around to a few bars . He did not drink any alcohol . Finally he went back to the hotel and to bed around four . For the next three days Winch made his small pilgrimage out to his wife 's western residential section every night . It was the main anchor of his daily routine . He slept or loafed till late afternoon or the evening , before going out for his single big meal and then flagging a cab . Each day he went out for a bottle of wine and drank it sitting at his cheap hotel room desk , before going out to eat . Each night he arrived at her address by about twelve-thirty . Each of the first two nights she came home with the same Air Force It/col . But then on the third night she came home with another man . This one was also an officer . But he was shorter and fatter , pudgy , and wore the gold oak leaves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they walked up to the door the same way . At the door they kissed the same way . Again the lights went on . Again nobody left . As if released from some devil 's bargain he had made , Winch turned on his heel and walked over to his traffic artery , caught a cab back to his hotel , packed his satchel , paid , and left . He caught another cab to the Greyhound station . The next bus south to Luxor did not leave for another hour . Winch spent it in a nearby bar , celebrating over a second bottle of wine for the day . This time he slept most of the way . Only once did he wake with any seriousness , to stare out at the dark of the great broodingriver rolling alongside the highway , on his left side now.  |p198Staring  , he thought about how the company in the midst of its anguish of change was forgetting them . Forgetting him . He could see how it could not be any other way . Consciously he thought it a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a dream , woke him up wanting to shout a command , " Get them out ! Get them out of there ! Fast ! Move them left ! Ca n't you see the mortars got them bracketed ! " With the first word already a shout in his throat , he was able to cut it off so that aloud he only grunted . Winch shook his head . It had been something about the attack on Hill 27 that day on the Canal . Only the terrain had looked different and strange . New . Winch shook his head again . But after that he slept , until dawn and the coming of the Southern sunlight woke him . Reallyawake now , he stared out at the Arkansas flatlands without depression . He did not feel satisfied , and he did n't feel free . But he knew now that the disintegration of his company was final and complete , blown away . Ahead the city loomed over him , high up on its bluff , a presentiment . Any future he had at all was around there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . Back at Kilrainey , which he hated , and which looked more and more like a prison as the taxi delivered him through the brick gates to the main door , he found that during his four-day junket Billy Spencer 's parents had been and gone . That was all to the good . Billy 's mother had thrown a terrible scene , Billy told him . That same day Winch 's doctors gave him another full checkoutexamination and found that he was in better shape than they had yet seen him . They could give no reasons why . But his EKG readings were better than any they had taken of him . And if things continued like that , and kept on improving , they saw no reason why he could not be returned to duty soon . Winch only grinned bitterly , and did not tell them about the bottles of wine . Two days later he had his first serious meeting with Carol Firebaugh in the big rec hall . She challenged him to a game of Ping-Pong . Winch had seen her around there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And actually had been introduced to her once , by Landers . But Winch had never spent much time in the rec hall , and had never had a conversation with her . This time , he had wandered in because he had just been with Billy again and did not want to go back to the heart ward andp199sit and brood . But after he had taken one turn around the place , he was ready to leave it . It was a place that had been created and engineered strictly for stupid men . Some smart guy , a Corps of Engineers officer no doubt , had designed it and laid it all out to be serviceable to what he thought of as stupid men , the enlisted classes . If you were a fifteen-year-old high school student , it would no doubt have seemed great . Two Ping-Pong tables stood at the near end near the doors , neither in use . The basketball hoops and backboards had been drawn up on their pulleys and tied there parallel to the floor . They would only be let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intramural game . The one-legged men , say , against the one-armed men , Winch thought evilly . Or when the Globetrotters came to play for the crippled . The theater stage was darkened , its red plush curtains drawn closed . It would be opened and the folding chairs put up on the basketball court when Bing Crosby or somebody came to entertain the injured troops . For now , men sat around uncomfortably on the comfortable sofas , and stared off at the high windows screened on the inside to keep the basketballs from hitting them . Thinking about cunt , probably . A few bathrobed men played checkers on the low tables . Two pairs of intellectuals engaged in chess games . In a far corner a volunteer worker in her sexless , motherly Gray Lady outfit conducted a listless class in basket weaving . As he was about to go out , Carol came up to him with a Ping-Pong ball and two paddles . " How about a game with me , Sergeant ? " She was smiling . The sheer beauty of just her youth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face . In addition she was quite beautifulin herself , in a nonmovie star way . But had anybody ever been that young , ever ? Winch wondered . Had he ? There was a certain coquettishness in her eyes and in her attitude that was very Southern . Winch had to hold himself tightly , not to respond with a cocky male truculence . He heard his own voice saying , " Sure . Okay . Why not ? " There were a number of things Winch had done well in his career , as Landers ruefully found out when in a moment of misbegotten intellectual superiority he 'd challenged Winch to a game of chess . In addition to football , basketball , springboardp200diving , track , checkers , and chess there was Ping-Pong . At Forts Bliss and Houston he had been one of the Army 's top players in the late nineteen thirties . He took off his maroon issue bathrobe and duck slippers and played her barefoot in his gray issue pajamas . He was able to play her three games before he had to quit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him feel good . He beat her 21-12 , 21-17 , 21-18 . She was a good player , and obviously had slyly believed she would beat him . " You 're really a fine player , " she said , laughing breathlessly . Her pale , black-Irish complexion was flushed and rosy under the raven black hair framing her forehead . " Do n't you want to play a few more ? " " No , " Winch said . He was trying to hide his own breathlessness . " You better practice up with somebody your own class , before you try me again . " " Oh ! " But she laughed . Winch wanted mostly to sit down someplace for a few minutes , but would not let himself . Instead , he put back on his maroon issue bathrobe and duck slippers . He walked over with her while she put away the paddles and the ball . When he asked her to have dinner with him that night , she accepted almost before he could get the words out of his mouth . He wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Claridge Hotel . He thought that would be better than the bar at the Peabody . But she was hardly inside and seated before it was plain she did not like being in the place . " I have n't been in this place since my high school senior prom , " she said nervously . " And is that such a long time ago ? " " Three and a half years . " She paused a moment . " Actually , it 's not that long . I 've been here since then . But I have n't been here since the war , and all the servicemen descended on Luxor . " " I do n't know any bar to take you where there are n't servicemen , " Winch said . " There are a few , " she said . She looked around the place again . " You find this place too low-brow for you , now ? " " No . But on the other hand it 's not the real Luxor any more , either . " She hunched her shoulders and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't like the way they look at me whenp201they 've been drinking . Out at the hospital it 's a different thing . " When they got around to discussing where to go for dinner , over their drinks from Winch 's brown-sacked bottle , she suggested a place she knew : Mrs. Thompson 's Tea Room . There would n't be servicemen there . Winch did n't know it was the same place she had suggested to Landers . But Winch vetoed it immediately , anyway . " Let 's get something straight . If I 'm going to be taking you around to places , I 'm not going to take you to places where you 're well known . Your own local places . I 'm going to take you places where you 're not known . My places . " Carol smiled . " Is that an order , sir ? " " Call it that . " " You 're ashamed to be seen with me ? Is that it ? " " No . Certainly not . I 'm thrilled and delighted , " Winch said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people you know in Luxor to think you 're robbing the cradle . " She laughed at that . " Yes . You 're some cradle rider . " Winch grinned , briefly . " I might be able to show you some places in your city you did n't even know existed . " " I 'll bet you could , " she said . " But I 'm not sure I want to see them . " For the dinner he took her to the Plantation Roof of the Peabody . She had n't been there in a long time , either . But after a little while she seemed to like it . " It 's certainly got energy , " she smiled , looking around . " I did n't know there were that many servicemen in Luxor . " Winch suddenly noticed she was not wearing her glasses . Her irises were dark , almost black . Her one sometimes uncontrollableeye was more prominent without them , and kept looking at him briefly and then looking guiltily away while the good eye went on smiling at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Booze , " he said grimly . " It 's the energy of the doomed . Most of these people will be shipping out of here soon . Either east or west . " " Please . Let 's do n't talk about that . " Her brother , her younger brother , Winch now found out , was a fighter pilot in Horida , finishing up his training before heading for Europe . That was why she was home from college this year . She was a good ballroom dancer , it turned out , light andp202supple and easy to lead . Winch paced himself carefully , sitting out as many dances as they danced so he would not get out of breath . " Why are you in the hospital ? " she asked when they were sitting out some dances . " What did they send you back to Americafor ? " Looking at him with that one unmanageable eye , she reached out a youth-smooth hand and placed it over his callused one on the table . Winch had been anticipating this question , and wondering how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tell her he had heart trouble . " Dengue fever and malaria , " he said , promptly and laconically . " Is that enough to get sent home for ? " " It is if it 's bad enough . " " And now you 're getting over it ? " " Just about . " " Is that why you do n't drink ? " She had had two whiskeys out of the bottle on the table . " I did n't know drinking was bad for malaria . " Winch shrugged . He wanted badly to change the subject . " They told me not to , " he said shortly . " And soon you 'll be going away again . Off somewhere . " " Probably , " Winch lied . " Actually , " he added , " I may be stationedhere for a while . In Second Army . " " That would be great , " Carol smiled . " Let 's dance awhile , " he said . It had been so long since any sexual desires had moved him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diuretics caused that . Holding her against him dancing , her breasts lying heavy against the chest of his shirtfront , he felt no sexual stirrings . That did n't bother him . It was n't sex he was after with her . It was that incredible , unbelievable youth . It stung him , like some furious insect . When he took her home to her parents ' house on the big , tall tree shaded avenue , he did not attempt to kiss her and told the taxi to wait as they got out . " Let him go , " she said . " Do n't you want to come in for a while ? " Winch shook his head . " I 'm too old to go around necking withp203girls on the sofas of their mamas ' parlors , " he said as they walked up the walk . " Oh , there might be more to it than that , " Carol smiled promptly . " Not on any living room sofas , with papa and mama upstairs , " Winch said . " Not for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can have a place to take you . If you want . " " Is that a threat ? " " No threat , " he said . " A promise . " They were at the door and instead of answering she put back her head , closed her eyes , and pushed out her lips for him to kiss her . Winch waited , deliberately , until she opened her eyes lookingstartled , before he leaned forward and put his lips on hers . When he did , she immediately popped her tongue into his mouth and rubbed it around hard all over the inside of his mouth in a mechanical way . " When ? " she said , when their mouths parted . " How about tomorrow night ? " Winch said , and when she nodded , added coldly , " First thing , I 'm going to have to teach you how to kiss . " Before she could answer that , he was on his way down the walk to the cab . He sat quietly on the ride back . He was feeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ failure attack in Letterman and old , what was her name ? Arlette . Carol pretty clearly did n't know any but the most obvious things about sex and it could be great sport to teach her . In his khakis which he never wore underwear with he could feel his cock crawling and extending itself a little , tentatively . His breathing deepened . He sat quietly in the cab and savored the sensations all the way back to the hospital , watching out the window the rich , well-off lawns and trees and avenues and then the poorer places and suburban juke joints of Luxor 's Southern city landscape . It was easy enough to arrange for a room at the Claridge . Jack Alexander kept two rooms there for players to rest or sleep or drink in , as well as the suite in which he ran the big-time , high-stakes poker game for the big winners of the Army 's monthly payroll . Alexander called the Claridge for him . Jack made sure the room was on another floor from the one his game was on . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't you ? " Carol said with a triumphant little smile , when he took her there afterp204another dinner at the Peabody 's Plantation Roof . " I 'll bet you 've done that many times before , with women . " Winch sensed she wanted him to grin . So he did , briefly . " If you want to know the real truth , " he smiled , " I 'm just too old to fart around any more . " " You intrigued me . You said you 'd teach me how to kiss . I thought I knew how . " " Well , you do n't , " he grinned . " The first thing to remember is never to use heavy pressure . And never be mechanical , never keep repeating the same movement . The whole art of sex is to tease just ever so slightly . That way you want more . And more . Come here . But first , let me show you how I undress ' you . " The covered parts of her were as deliciously , unbelievably youthful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ounce of fat on her . With that black , black hair and pale , pale skin of the black Irish she had a thick black luxurious bush against her white belly . She played a lot of tennis and golf , she said . Her father was a big-time lawyer in Luxor , she told him . " How old did you say you were ? " " I 'm uh twenty-two . " The slight hesitation betrayed her . " I will be . Soon . " " How soon ? " " In seven months . " She blushed . " I 'm old enough to be your father . " " I think of you as something else . You make me think of a smart , tough , wise , old elephant , who 's been roaming his forests forever , " she whispered . " I do , hunh ? " Winch said . She did not seem to mind at all that he was extraordinarily slow in achieving an erection . " I do n't know why I 'm drawn to you so , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her , she added in a breathy voice , " I 'll have to go home later , you know . I ca n't stay out all night . " He found , as he had suspected , that she knew very little about sex at all . He was sure she had not , for example , ever had anyone go down on her before . But he decided that that could wait for some future session . " Do you think I 'm attractive ? " she whispered as he raisedhimself over her to enter her , and stretched out her longwaisted , long-legged pale black-Irish body for him on the bed . " Yes . " Winch did n't feel it necessary to elaborate . In any caseWinch was discovering for the first time in his life , to his sur/prise and disbelief , fatigue in sex . As he worked on her carefully in the bed . He had always been in good enough shape , before , that he had never had to worry about becoming tired . Now was different . " Oh . Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it with her eyes closed . How many women had said that line to how many new men ? Winch wondered . To each new man . He had never been much at long-dicking them but he knew he had a more than usual circumference . While they were lying side by side afterward , after he had come , though he was sure she had n't , Carol said , " What are we going to do ? What 's going to happen to us ? " Winch thought that that , to say the least , was a little bit premature . " Well , for one thing , we can have a hell of a great time together for a while , " he said softly . But after two weeks of her he found he too was beginning to think distastefully about his having to move out to Camp O'Bruyerre and Second Army some time soon . It was only thirty miles from Luxor but that thirty miles meant he would not find it that easy to meet her in town every night . But by that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about his old mess/sgt that , some way or other , Johnny Stranger had seen the shit hit the fan.  |p206When  he left Luxor for Cincinnati with his two three-day passes in his pocket , Strange was so used to the long crowded bus trip by now , had done it so many times , that he about had it memorizedand hardly bothered to look out . He had hoped to doze but in the moving vehicle full of breathingbodies it was impossible to sleep . The air of the big bus was clogged with exhaled body moisture , and a kind of perpetual murmur . Strange sucked at a pint bottle of whiskey he had bought for the trip , stretched in the cramped seat , and let his mind run over the story and catastrophe of Billy Spencer . His mind had been wanting to do that since the day Billy had first shown up . Strange had known he would have to come to grips with it eventually . The arrival of Billy at Kilrainey had been as much a torture for Strange as it was for Winch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Strange could not come to terms with it in the way Winch apparently had . Billy Spencer was the first so-called basket case the company had had . And while everybody understoodtheoretically that such things could happen , nobody really believed it would happen to him . And nobody ever really he/lieved it would happen to anyone in their company . They had all heard of them in other companies . Winch seemed able to cope with that . But Strange could n't . The unparalleled distress Strange felt when he thought about his own having survived relatively untouched , in comparison to Billy , made the skin on his back twitch , and his buttocks tighten with guilt . Whenever he thought of poor Billy a wild irrational hatred for all civilians who had never been out there and been through it slammed through him and made him want , unreasonably , to smash in the face of any civilian that might present itself to him . It was unreasonable , and Strange knew it was unreasonable . But even worse than that for Strange was the story Billy had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been willing enough to leave the company , willing in fact even when he knew leaving it and shipping back to the States would mean being assigned to some new outfit and never going back . But that did not mean he wanted it to fade away , be broken up , disappear . It was losing its identity and personality under other officers and new noncoms shipped in from outside . It was becoming another , no longer recognizable unit . That was a calamity . Somewhere in the back of Strange 's mind there had always been the idea that someday when the war was over they would all of them all get together again somewhere . Become again the unit it once had been , only grown wiser and more experienced by war service . Strange had been too embarrassed ever to speak of this to anyone , but he nevertheless had clung to the idea . The idea had always been a pipe dream , of course . But as long as the company was still out there , with some semblance of its old roster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to and at least play with the idea . Now , with the company no longer there , and filled up and loaded down with strangers , Strange felt uprooted , homeless . He suffered from feeling naked and alone and orphaned with a severity he had never experienced before . Not even when he left home , or when his parents died . The existence of his civilian wife and her civilian family where he was accepted as a member was no help for this feeling at all . In the wet-aired bus Strange sucked disconsolately at his pint of whiskey . What the hell , it was n't something that was goingp208to kill him . He had been in the Army long enough to get used to changing outfits . He had done it a number of times . But there was something special about this outfit . And he saw clearly enough that it was the war had done it . Death  --  death , and maiming  --  had pulled it together in a way the peacetime Army had never done with outfits . Shared deaths , shared woundings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't be easy to find again . And Strange did not know if he had the courage to start over from scratch and knowing what he knew now , go through the process a second time . Outside the bus at the rest stops , when he got down occasionally to relieve himself , there was a chill of October in the fresher air . When he finally got to the house in Covington it was midafternoon , and almost exactly the same time of day that he had arrived all the other times . Linda 's paternal uncle , 4-F older brother , and maternal cousin were all still sleeping preparatory to going off on the night shift . This time when they all began straggling down they found Strange already in the kitchen , drinking beer . Strange sat with them again in the kitchen while they made their breakfast , and had some bacon and eggs himself . None of them seemed much interested that his hand had been operated on and that he now wore the plaster plate on it , since they had seen hire last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should have been working the day shift and therefore should be coming home soon , had in fact been transferred to the swing shift . Instead of coming home she had just gone off to work , and would not be getting off until midnight . Strange hung around the house till some of the other women began coming home from work and from shopping , and then had to get out . The women filled up the kitchen so with their gossip and their preparations for cooking dinner that he could n't stand it . The only other place availablewas Linda 's little chintz-covered bedroom , which was too small for loafing and too small for anything else except sleeping , and maybe fucking . He went to a lousy war movie . In it some green young Navy kid , stranded in Bataan , kept letting the spoons fly off of hand grenades and counting to three before he threw them , usually just across a coconut log where evil-looking Japanese were shooting point-blank at him . It was so outrageous that finallyp209about halfway through he had to leave . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faces of the people bathed in the flickering light from the screen as they chewed handfuls of popcorn and watched the fighting with avid eyes , and for a brief insane momentwished he had two or three grenades with him , to toss in among them . And see how they liked it . After that , he simply went around from bar to bar drinking . When he finally went back to the house at twelve-thirty , he was three-fourths tight and went to bed in the little chintz room . Two others of the family who were on the swing shift were already home in the kitchen , and he talked to them for a while . Linda did not get home until after three . Of course , she had not known he was coming . She was terriblyapologetic when she found him , just waking up , in the little bedroom . Linda was about half-crocked herself , and explained she had been with a few of the girls for some drinks . When he wanted to make love to her , she was warm and kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could call hot . When he was humping her , she stroked his head . He would have preferredher to be passionate . But there was no inkling of anything else . Not that Strange could feel . Why should there be ? Their lovemaking was the same as it had always been . Perhaps it was even just a little better than usual . But when , after he had come , he tried to talk to her about what Curran had said concerning the new , second operation and what this could mean to them with the restaurant , she begged off from hearing about it and wanted to go to sleep . When he went on talking anyway , she broke down and began to cry . " But , Linda , honey , do n't you understand ? " he persisted . " You can have your restaurant . All I have to do is say no to this second operation and they 'll discharge me . " " I do n't want to hear about it now , " she wept . " I 'm too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk about it tomorrow ? Please ? " " Sure , sure . Of course . Do n't cry . Do n't cry , for God 's sake , " Strange said , and stroked her shoulder . After she was asleep , he lay awake a long time with his arms behind his head , thinking . It certainly was n't the reaction he had expected . He suggested that he take her out for a nice high-class lunch somewhere , when she came down at eleven the next morning , because he thought she looked peaked and worn down . Cer/tainly the kitchen , with its ebb and flow of family workers preparing or cooking one meal or another , was no place for a discussion . But Linda instead of being pleased gave him a sharp look , and then after a moment said she could n't have lunch with him . Though she did not say why . Instead , she wanted him to pick her up at a bar near her job after she got off at midnight . She gave him the address . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she said . So Strange found himself with another whole day to put in . He was soured on war movies but there did not seem to be anything else playing anywhere . Across the river the whole town of Cincinnati seemed full of nothing but war films . Finally he found a theater that was showing a rerun of The Story of Vernon and Irene Castle , and went to see that . He remembered the outfit had seen that on Guadalcanal , and had loved it . But , now , the richness and wealth and high life of Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers was so foreign to anything he knew and so out of step with his mood of now that he left that one , too , before it was half over . Hell , even when they were poor they lived rich . He tried not to drink too much , because he wanted to have his brains sharp . But it was hard not to . It seemed everybody everywherewho was n't working was drinking . He decided to take a taxi to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to trust trying the bus system . He had already arranged where to take her to dinner . Across the river in Cincinnati during his lone drinking hours he had checked around , and found a ritzy hotel which had a place like the Peabody 's Plantation Roof that served good steak dinners till very late . Strange was proud of the sophisticated tastes he had developed during his two-month stay in Luxor , and decided to take her there and show her . Only when they were arriving and getting out of the taxi did it occur to him that such a high-class place might embarrass Linda and make her uncomfortable . She had never gone to ritzy places , even back in Wahoo . But of course , by the time he thought of this , it was already too late and they were at the door . He need n't have worried . Linda seemed at least as at home in the place as he was . When he tipped the head waiter three dollars to get them a nice quiet table off to themselves , she noted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the French words and ordered her dinner as smoothly and calmly as if shep211had been doing it right along . Strange ordered drinks for them , and she said she 'd take a martini . After he 'd ordered the drinks , he sat back and looked around , without really thinking that he had never known Linda Sue to drink a martini before . The big place was jam-packed and they were surrounded by servicemen and their women . The few civilian men in the place appeared drowned in the big sea of khaki and blue . On the bandstand a sixteen-piece orchestra played through both " Little Sir Echo " and " Racing with the Moon " while Strange sipped at his drink and tried to collect his thoughts . He had never been much of a ballroom dancer so it did not occur to him to ask Linda to dance . Since she would not mention the operation or bring it up , Strange was forced finally to bring it up himself . " Well , where shall I begin ? " he said finally . Linda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ask me to dance first ? " she said . " Oh , " Strange said . " Sure . " On the dance floor , which though big was crowded , he moved her around to the music of " Chattanooga Choo-Choo , " feeling upset and disturbed . The song was almost finished before he realized that Linda Sue was dancing beautifully with him , and stopped and moved her away from him to look down at her . " Did n't you notice I 've learned to dance since you 've been away ? " she said . " Yeah . Yes , " Strange said . " I just now noticed . How did that come about ? " Behind him a sailor still in summer whites bumped into him and he started moving again . " Oh , well . You know . A lot of us girls go out dancing together , " Linda said against his shoulder . " You dance with each other ? " Strange said . " Chattanooga Choo-Choo " ended and without waiting for applause the band moved into " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had made so famous . Strange had heard it on the radio on both the Canal and New Georgia . And Tokyo Rose used to play it . " Most of the time , " Linda said against his ear . " Sometimes the goys ask us to dance , too . " In spite of his awkwardness and lack of talent Strange found himself dancing better with her now , because of her new exper/tise , than he had ever danced before . Instead of making him feel good it made him feel more disquieted . When the song ended , he took her back to the table and orderedthem another drink . " Can we have some red wine with the steak , too ? " Linda said . " Wine ? " Strange said , " wine ? Sure . Sure , why the hell not ? " " Just ask the man for the wine list , " she said , and gave hima funny smile . " Do you want me to wait until after we 've eaten ? " Strange said , after he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she said . " No , I guess not . " " Well , " Strange said , " here 's the story . " But as he laid out for her the options Curran had offered him , doing it with that same patient thoughtfulness he had been so famous for and was so proud of back in the company , he began to feel more and more disquiet , more and more distress . He did n't know why exactly . She just was n't reacting right . She did n't say anything at all until he finished telling it . " So you see , " he wound it up , " I can get discharged  --  " he moved his shoulders , " almost immediately . We can start working on that restaurant . While the war boom is still on . Probably your folks would loan us some money , would n't they ? " " What will happen to your poor hand ? " Linda said with a sad smile , and reached across and put her hand over the bound member in its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the same . I 'll have only partial use of the two middle fingers . But hell , I 've been living like that for almost a year now . It ai nt so bad . Probly I 'll get some kind of a pension , I guess . " " And if you have the operation ? " Strange shrugged again , impatiently , feeling irritable . She knew all that . " He ca n't guarantee he can fix it . If he does , I 'll have to stay in . For the duration . If he ca n't , it 'll be the same , anyway . " " Well , " Linda said , sadly , " it 's a beautiful offer . " " Christ , ai nt you happy about the restaurant ? " Strange could n't resist saying . " Yes , of course . But  --  " She stopped . " But , what ? " It was at just that moment , as if deliberately prearranged by some consciously malignant fate , that the waiter arrived withp213their steaks . Behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called " Elmer 's Tune . " " Let 's eat , first , " Linda said . " Then I 'll tell you what 's been happening . " If she was upset or depressed or sad it certainly had no effect on her appetite . She put away the entirety of her big , healthy steak except for a thin strip of fat rind , and with it a whole order of French fries , green beans , and a salad . Working so hard made her hungry , she said . Strange attacked his own big steak as if wreaking vengeance on it for the meal 's having interrupted them when it did . After putting down three hefty glasses of the red wine with her meat , Linda Sue pushed her plate daintily two inches away from her with her knife and fork laid side by side on it , put her elbows on the table , and looked at him with wide , clear , unguarded , sorrowful eyes . " Yes , " Strange said . " Well , what ? " " Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that  --  It 's because  --  Well , I 've got a , uh , boyfriend . " " You 've got a what ? " Strange said . She blushed crimson . " Well . An , uh , lover . I 've got a lover . " " You 've got a lover , " Strange said . He would remember later that the sixteen-piece orchestra was playing the ballad called " I 'll Be Seeing You , " a song recorded and made popular by Vera Lynn and probably the most well-liked song of the whole damned war , so far . " Yes , " Linda Sue said , over the music . " And I 'm not going to give him up . " But , of course , Strange 's mind was saying to him . So many things fell into place so suddenly that it was all there in front of him , all of a piece , a consistent pattern , only he had all along just not interpreted it right , was all . How she had been so confused and almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How she had decided not to come down to Luxor , because of her job . How she had seemed so distant when he came up to Cincinnati , because she was tired from overwork . How she had slept with him so indifferently , all those times . How she had not cared if he slept with her or not , all those times he had not slept with her . You should have figured that out , dumbhead , his mind was saying to him . " You 've got a lover , " Strange said . " And you 're not going to give him up . Good . Fine . Well , who is this guy ? " Do n't talk aboutp214it , his mind warned him . If you let her start talking about it , you have lost . " He 's a lieutenant colonel in the Air Force , " Linda said promptly , as if she had worked her speech all out , " and he 's a wonderful person . He 's a Princeton graduate , and he comes from someplace on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the new sophistication , would n't it ? " And I suppose you want to marry him ? " Strange said . He felt tired suddenly , and he wished they would stop playing that damned song . That fucking " I 'll Be Seeing You . " She did not answer him but went straight on . " He does a lot of design work on airplanes , " she said , instead . As if from her prepared speech . " And he does a lot of work up at Patterson Field . But his main office is here . And anyway , he flies up there and back whenever he wants to or feels like it . He has a plane , at his beck and call . I met him at our plant when he was there looking at some parts that he thought he might use in some design . And so now , he spends more time here than he does up there , because of me . At least , the evenings . The nights . " " Sure . The evenings , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you want to marry him ? " " He 's six foot two , " Linda went on . " With wide shoulders and a small head , blue eyes , and a long neck . And he 's the greatest gentleman I ever met . And he 's crazy in love with me . " " Are you going to marry him , God damn it ? " Strange shouted , but in a low voice . " You want a divorce . Is that it ? " Linda dropped her eyes demurely , and blushed again . " He ca n't marry me , " she said simply . " He would love to . But he 's got a wife and four small children back there in Long Island . And he ca n't leave them . " " Because they got the money , " Strange said grimly . " Perhaps , " Linda said . " Maybe . But he ca n't leave them . And I do n't care . And I 'm not going to give him up . " " But , why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He makes me feel things I 've never felt before . " " What kind of things ? " " Sex things . " She blushed a third time , completely crimson . " Like what ? " " Lovemaking things , " Linda said , still blushing , still looking away.  | " I think I 'll order us another drink , " Strange said tiredly . " Yes . Please do . I wish you would , " she said . " I do n't like this any better than you do . " " You must like it some better , " Strange said grimly , " since it 's not you who 's losing anything . Would you mind telling me what kind of lovemaking things ? " She waited till he had signaled the waiter and ordered the new drinks , still blushing furiously , still unwilling to look at him . Only when the waiter went away , was out of hearing range , did she speak . " He kisses me , down there , " she said , her face bright red . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how to come . To have orgasms . Do you realize I 've never had an orgasm in my life till I met him ? " " Good God , " Strange said . " Never ? " " Never once . And you 're the first man I ever , uh , went to bed with . " " Not even once ? " Strange said . " I always thought  --  I guess I never thought about it . " " I 'm not blaming you . But you can see why I 'm never going to give him up . I 'm going to stay with him . At least until the war 's over . " " Or they move him someplace else , " Strange said . " Yes , " she said . " There 's that . Have you ever gone out withany other women than me ? I mean since we 're married ? " Strange raised his eyes to stare at her . But she was still looking down , at the table . " No , " he lied . " Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm truly sorry for you . But that does n't change anything . " " No . " " I guess you wo n't want to stay married to me . Under the circumstances . " " No . I guess not . " Strange was thinking that it would be easy enough to put it all down to some form of retribution . That was what he was feeling . But was that really the truth ? After all , he had not gone to bed wi ; h that girl Frances at the Peabody until long after I , inda ha her Air Force It/col . Of course , he had gone down to t he who , ehouses that one time in Wahoo with the boys , after she left . And a couple of other times , after he 'd brought her out and married her , he 'd gone down to the whores on a toot with a hunch of the guys . And sweated blood for two weeks after ,  |p216afraid  he might have picked up a dose of something . But in spite of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was just the war . " Do you kiss him down there , too ? " he asked . " Yes . " She was blushing furiously again . " I 'm going to give you all of the money in the account , " she said . " It 's yours . There 's a little over seven thousand now . " " I do n't want it , " Strange said . " It does n't matter , " Linda said . " Because I 'm not going to keep it . If you do n't take it , I 'll give it to daddy . So you better take it . " " Okay , I 'll take it , " Strange said . He had suddenly become aware of that damned band again . Now they were playing " How High the Moon , " another song he had heard on the radio in the tropical islands of the Far East . Tokyo Rose had played that one , too . " You can see why I ca n't take it , " Linda said . Strange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 've answeredmy question for me . You 've solved my problem for me , " he said , looking up . " What are you going to do ? " " Why , have that damned second operation . That 's what . " Linda did not say anything , did not answer him . " It 's getting really late , " he said . " I suppose we ought to be going . " " Do n't you want to dance with me ? One more time ? I 've learned to really love to dance , " Linda said . " No , I do n't , " Strange said . " I really do n't . " From the other side of the table she reached over her hand and put it over his claw , bound down on its plaster plate . Agitatedly , he pulled his away . But there was no fight . Back at the house in Covington , up in her little chintzy bedroom , at five A.M. with the dawn just comingup , they more or less amicably went through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great deal like two old friendly business partners who for various reasons are splitting up their firm . She arranged for and wrote out a check for him to cash , closing out their mutual bank account . She would start a new one , she said . Then Linda got ready for bed . And Strai , ; e started downstairs , to drink some beers with any members oft ie family who might be just getting up or getting ready to go to bed . But when he got to the head of the stairs , she called him back . " I 'll sleep with you tonight , anyway , " she said . " If you want . "  | " Jesus , no , " Strange said . And then she started to cry . " Christ , do n't cry , " Strange said . " For God 's sake , do n't cry . " She did n't answer . " Will you tell me one thing , " Strange said . " Did you really like it ? When he kissed you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , incredibly , went right into a deep crimson blush , as red as a beet . " I loved it . I  --  I adored it , " she said . " I 've never had anything feel like that in my life . " " Well then do n't cry , " Strange said harshly , and pulled the door to , gently . Then he pushed it back open . " Do you realize that all that time , since I 've been back , when you were sleeping with him , you were screwing me , too ? " " I was your wife , " she said . Downstairs in the kitchen her older paternal cousin , who had just got up to get ready to go on the day shift , was sitting with Linda 's maternal cousin 's wife , who had only just come home herself after getting off the swing shift . Since they were drinkingbeer , both of them , Strange joined them . He did not tell them he was leaving . Probably , they would not have cared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was so late getting home from the swing shift , herself . He was waiting at the bank when they opened the doors , with Linda 's check to cash . He got a certified cashier 's check for $7,140 , and put it away in his wallet . Near the bus station he bought another pint of whiskey for the bus trip back , but he was pretty sure he 'd have to get another somewhere around Nashville , the way he felt . He sure did n't have much of a batting average for completing his leaves and passes , he thought as he climbed on the daytime Greyhound . The certified check in his wallet did not seem to make it feel any heavier , or make him feel any lighter , not the way he felt . But he knew just what he was going to do with the money when he got back to Luxor.  |p218Bobby  Prell was in his wheelchair on his ward 's small dayroom porch when Strange came down the ward looking for him . Ile was playing solitaire . Prell had had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and was in no mood to think about anything but himself . But he could tell something had happened to Strange , when he saw him . " What 's the matter with you ? " " With me ? Nothing . Why ? " Prell knew his new buddy well enough to know when something was wrong . Being thrown together in so many hospitals , Prell believed , had given them a strong sense of each other . At the same time , the final removal of his casts and a good look at his poor lousy crippled legs had given Prell an enormous shock . He had seen them before , during the first time the casts were off , but they had been covered back up quickly in new , safe plaster cocoons so that he was able to put them out of his mind , not think about them . Now he had to think about them . It did not make for any mood of intense optimism . Withered , was the only word to describe them . From his hipsp219down they were nothing but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skin hung down from the knitted femurs and the shinbones . In the middle , his frozen knees were huge red knobs . Thick red welts and ridges of scar tissue crisscrossed both thighs where the .50 cal slugs had hit him . The idea that he might ever walk on them again was a horrible , grotesque joke . And the pain had started again , immediately the therapy started . It was not as bad as the pain he had had on the train but it was with him all the time , never stopped . " How 're you , old buddy ? " Strange demanded . He gave a mean grin as he sauntered on out onto the glassed-in porch . It was not your normal Johnny Stranger grin . This grin made Prell think of the last time Strange had had to fire a 1st/cook for laziness and malingering . " Not too bad . " Prell wondered if Strange would notice the casts were gone , and if so , how soon . " You been up to Cincinnati again ? " " Yes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little money . " Strange whipped out his wallet from his bathrobe pocket and pulled out a large-sized bank check . He spread it open before Prell . " Money ? " Prell said . " Money . And I 'm itchin ' to begin spendin ' it . " Prell whistled when he saw the amount . " Your old lady know about this ? " He made himself grin . He was certainly not himself going to tell Strange about the missing casts . " My old lady is making a fortune up there in them defense plants . She do n't need this . " " It 's a hell of a lot of money , " Prell made himself say . " You bet . And I figured it 's about time I started utilizing some of it . " Strange paused , and pushed forward his chest . " You know about that famous suite of rooms those Navy friends of Landers have at the Peabody ? Well , I thought I 'd get me one of those . For a while . For all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in disbelief . This was surely not the Johnny Stranger he knew . Strange had always been the biggest , most notorious miser the old company had had . " How long before you think you 'll be able to go into town ? " Strange said . " I want you in on the opening . " Then for the first time , he looked down and noticed the missing casts . " Hey ? " He put his hand gently on one of the horrible , scabby-looking , withered feet . " They 're off ? For good ? How 's it going ? "  | " Terrible . " Prell said it without expression or emotion , factually . " I hear they 're giving seven for one on the leg wards that I 'll never walk on them again . " " They 're wrong , " Strange said . " I think I 'll go pick me up some of that seven-to-one money . " " I know they 're wrong , " Prell said , in his sturdy , West Virginiaway . " They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think you better wait two weeks and see , just the same . Besides , the odds 'll go up . To nine or ten . " " Hey . Listen . There might be a way we could make some money on this , " Strange said . " You mean betting it ? " " Sure . If you were to wait ? If you were to work hard at the therapy ? And not show anybody ? Not let anybody see the results . Make it look bad . Why , hell . The odds might go as high as twenty to one . I 'd lay a lot on that . " Prell studied him . " And we could let Landers know . " Again , he was struck by how changed Strange seemed . Winch was the one who would have concocted such a scheme . " What about the other company guys ? " Strange said . " Fuck ' em , " Prell said in a flat voice . " I 'll tell you something , Johnny Stranger . I do n't feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here before we did . They do n't really seem like the old company . Besides , the more people you tell about a thing , the more it 's likely to leak out . " " That 's true , " Strange said . " And I do n't feel that close to them myself , any more . But what about Winch ? " Prell could feel his face get stiff , and flat . His Indian eyes narrowed . Once again , the mere name put in his visual mind that same picture of Winch , standing over him in the bed that day , with his bright eyes and evil grin . Accusing him of letting his squad get shot up because he was medal-hunting . " I would n't give that son of a bitch nothing , " he said . " I would n't give him floor space in hell . " " Aw , now , " Strange said . Coldly , Prell watched him shrug . " Anyway , " Prell said , " I do n't know if what you 're thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had changed his whole mood . He felt sullen . He did n't care now whether they did it or not . " Look . It 's going to be a long time . Three months ? Maybe the guys you make the bets with will have left the hospital . How you going to collect ? "  | " We 'll think of some way to secure the money . Put it in sealed envelopes ? Leave them with a nurse , or some doctor ? " " I ai nt got any money , " Prell said . He felt stubborn . And sullen . He could n't help it . " I got here broke . And I ai nt got my back pay yet . " " I 'll loan you money , " Strange said . He waved his check , and then put it away . " I 've got the money . How much do you want ? I 'll put up for us both . " " I could invest a thousand , " Prell said . " I 'll get at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll start laying off some bets . " " You better wait two weeks , " Prell said . " Till we see how I 'm doing . " " I 'm not worried about you , " Strange said . " Listen , how long do you think it 'll be before you can get in town on a pass ? " " But I wo n't have Winch involved , " Prell said . He paused a moment , stubbornly , thinking . " Matter of fact , he may just bet the other way . I bet he will . If he does , you cover whatever he puts up with my money . I do n't care how much . I 'll raise it some way . " I hate to do that to Winch , " Strange said . " But of course if that 's the way you want it . " It appeared to Prell that Strange 's eyes had grown suddenly shallow , and thoughtful . " No shenanigans , " Prell said sternly . " If you do that to me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swear it . " No , no . No shenanigans . Now , how about that trip to town ? When can you ? " " I do n't know . How do I know ? I suppose I could go right now , if we could get me a folding wheelchair someplace . " " I want you there for the opening , " Strange said , and drew himself up and grinned . " I tell you , there 's more pussy around there than you can shake your dick at . " " I 'd like to come , " Prell said . " But I ai nt going to be much good for any fucking . Casts or no casts . " " I suppose not , " Strange said . " How you coming along with that little girlfriend of yours ? " " Great . Fine . I 've got her jerking me off into a handkerchief every day . I 've got her so she 'll kiss it a little , but I ca n't get her to take the whole thing in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other , mirthfully.  |p222Strange  cackled . " Well , I guess you ai nt hurting any , then . " He waved his arm once more . " I 'll look into this about the bets . I get that suite arranged for , I 'll be back to see you . You see what you can do about borrowing a folding wheelchair . " Prell watched him leave , turning the wheels of the wheelchair with his hands so he could look after him . He was getting adept with the damned thing . After a while your mind stopped even thinking about it . And it was always good to see Strange . But something had happened to Strange in Cincinnati this time . Prell would have bet money on it . Well , if Strange did n't want to talk about it , he did n't have to . Something had happened to Prell , too . Getting those casts off was no ordinary everyday experience , either . And he was much more ardent about the future of his legs , and walking , in Strange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or than he felt now . Prell actually had overheard some bitter soul of a double amputee from the Sicilian invasion , offering seven to one that Prell would not be walking by the time the amputee left Kilrainey . That would have to be at least three months away . The amputee had not gotten any takers . After only two days of therapy , Prell was secretly inclined to agree with the amputee . That he could n't do it in three months . And there was that strong possibility looming there that he might never be able to do it . That was why , although he had put a brighter front on it , he had told Strange to wait awhile and see , before committing money . He had been equally dishonest with Strange about his girlfriend . He had n't actually lied . He had been able to get her to toss him off in a handkerchief . And he 'd been able to get her to kiss his cock once or twice . But , certainly , she did n't really like it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he 'd told Strange . The truth was , he had not tried that hard to force her . For fear of making her angry . He was afraid of making her so mad at him she would stop coming to visit him . She would do almost everything else . She would squirm herself against him by the hour . Kiss and neck with him until he was hot as a little red fire wagon . Let him play with her tits . Even let him play with her pussy . As long as her panties remainedover it . Play with it till the crotch of her panties was sopping wet . But as far as Prell knew she never came . A couple of times they tried to screw , with her getting on top of him ,  |p223while  he was still in the casts , but it always caused him so much pain in his legs that they had to stop . Della Mae Kinkaid . That was her name , and she was seventeen . Her daddy was in some Signal Corps outfit in Australia . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sent them . Old Della Mae had nothing against screwing . She freely admitted she was not a virgin . The only trouble was , Prell could n't fuck . And with the casts off now , without their protection , it was even worse . But everything other than fucking made Della Mae balk . It was either awful , or evil , or disgraceful , or unsanitary . She would never let him get his hand inside her pussy , for example . Unsanitary . And except for those few times when he had forced her to jack him off , she would let him place her hand on his swollen cock only as long as the cock remained inside the MedicalCorps pajamas . If any jacking off was to get done , except for those few times , he had to do it himself . Which he usually did , after one of their sessions . The trouble with a damned hospital ward was there was so damned little privacy . And when he tried to get his thumb on her clitoris , Della Mae disallowed that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it happen when they were out on the dayroom porch , and then she would become quite heated . But of course they were always being interrupted . Damned privacy . That was one good thing about being a Medal of Honor winner , Prell was learning . People would do you favors . The afternoonward boy let him use one of the two little private rooms at the front end of the ward for Della Mae 's afternoon " reading " sessions . The ward boy never asked any questions . But Della Mae would never let him touch her clitoris , in there . Prell would stay in there alone , with a wad of toilet paper , for a while after Della Mae left . Another thing Prell was reluctant to admit to Strange , or anybody , was that he was missing old Della Mae more and more on the days she did not come on the ward . And waiting more and more hungrily for her on the days that she did . And lately , she had been talking to him more and more about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Medal of Honor had a great deal to do with that , too . Old Della Mae was at least as fascinated by it as everybody else was . It was the Medal of Honor that had drawn her to him in the ward in the first place . And it was thep224Medal of Honor that had allowed him to get as far with her as he had . Prell was aware of all that . The Medal , with a capital T on the The and a capital M on the noun  --  as he had taken to thinking of it  --  The Medal worked wonders with just about everybody . It got him extra services from the ward boys . It got him special meals from the mess hall when he wanted them . It got him special on-post passes from the nurses on the ward when he asked for them . It allowed him to keep a bottle of booze on the ward , with the night man . The only person it did not seem to work with was Maj Hogan . His Medal of Honor only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by putting him in a special category beyond Hogan 's administrative policy , where Hogan could not control or thwart him , it inflamed the major 's soul . But except for Hogan it worked . The Medal even worked with his irascible , irritable Chief Surgeon Col Baker . Who had by now cheerfully admitted publicly that he had made a mistake in judgment with Prell . The only such of his career , Baker would hasten to add . It was to Col Baker that Prell went with his request for a folding wheelchair . Prell knew that they had them . He also knew there was no use going to Hogan for one . Shortly before his casts were to come off for the final time , they had used a folding wheelchair on him . A request had come down , via Hogan , from the office of Col Stevens , for Prell to make a personal appearance and a small speech at a war bonds rally being conducted by the Luxor Chamber of Commerce . It was not a direct order . It was in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubt that Prell was expected to comply . Prell did . And found it was one of the easiest things he had ever had to do . It was easy because everybody loved him . An ambulance , and this folding wheelchair , were sent to pick him up . The speech was already written for him , by some writer on Col Stevens ' staff . All he had to do was look it over , and then wheel himself out in front of the officers and officials on the stage of the big auditorium and read it into the microphone . Afterward , there were drinks for everybody at a cocktail party , and people came up to shake his hand . It all gave Prell a curious feeling there were two Luxors , existing side by side , or perhaps one on top the other . There was the Luxor of his buddies of cunt and cock and booze and parties that never stopped , going nonstop day and night in the hotelsp225and bars . And there was another Luxor of businessmen and families , who went to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without being aware of the first Luxor , which was not aware of them , either . Prell was aware of both . Because he had visited the second Luxor , to make a speech , in his folding wheelchair . This was the group that paid for the wheelchairs . So he knew the hospital had at least one folding wheelchair . He brought it up to Col Baker the next morning at morning rounds . At first , the short-tempered colonel 's eyes bulged out and a snarl came over his gaunt lined face . " You want a pass ? You want a pass ? Because the people from your old company are renting a suite at the Peabody ? " " For a celebration . Yes , sir . " Behind Baker , Hogan was beginning to fume and splutter and turn red . " Well , I 'll be goddamned , " Baker snarled . " And of course you 'll have to have a folding wheelchair . That much is obvious . Right ? " " Yes , sir . Well , they gave me one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rally . " " And just what do you expect to do when you get yourself into the elevator and up to this suite at the Peabody ? Get drunk , I suppose . " Prell had planned toward this . His whole idea was that the evil-tempered Baker might somewhere inside him be susceptible to the blunt truth . That might get him , where something else would n't . " Well , sir , I 'm hoping to try and get myself laid . " " You 're what ? " Hogan was now red as a beet with outrage . But Baker was beginning to grin , in a wolfish way . " I know I 'm not in much of any great shape for it . With these casts off only a few days . But I 'd like to try . I 've been laying around an awful long time now without getting any . " " You 've got as much chance of fucking some woman as you 've got of pole-vaulting six and a half feet , " Baker said . " I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ways of taking care of it , " Prell said . Baker was seriously grinning now , if somewhat reluctantly . " By God , I think you deserve the chance . Damn if I do n't . Major Hogan , you see to it , will you , " he said shortly . Prell was still congratulating himself when Strange came byp226with Landers in tow that afternoon . Strange had banked his money , and was sporting a new checkbook along with a big wad of cash . But he had not been able to get the Peabody suite . It would be four days before they could let him have one . They were booked that far in advance . Strange had felt badly about it at first . He had wanted it the worst way . Right away . Not only for Prell , but for himself . When you wanted something that bad it was depressing not to get it , he said . But Strange reasoned it would be that much better for Prell , to have four more days of therapy , before trying it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him with the folding wheelchair and taxi . " There 's just one thing , " Strange said . " We 've got to invite Winch . " " Yes , " Landers said . " We 've got to . Everybody else from the company is coming . We simply ca n't not invite him . " It was clear to Prell Strange ears Prell could tell his face had gone white . Strange knew how much Prell admired and respected Landers ' opinions . " Well , just keep him away from me , " was all Prell said . " Keep him at the other end of the room . Or I 'll brain him with a chair leg . " Strange looked relieved . " He ai nt going to cause you trouble . Nobody believes that stuff he said . " " No thanks to him , " Prell said . He felt frustrated . Suddenly he gripped the rubbered hand wheels of the big-wheeled chair , and rolled himself back and forth a foot or so , repeatedly and furiously . Back and forth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go in a taxi , rather than in the ambulance . In the ambulance they had had the big back door to slide him in , and a cot for him to lie on . Prell discovered this right away , at the front gate , before he even got out of the folding wheelchair Maj Hogan had so reluctantly and ungraciouslyprovided . Landers and Strange were able to get him out of the chair well enough , but then one of them had to let go of him to fold up the chair . At this point the cab driver , when he saw what was going on , leaped out and and came running around the cab , following his paunch like a train following a cow-catcher , to help . Together , the three of them got him into the front seat beside the meter and got the folded chair into the back beside Landers and Strange . Back behind his steering wheel , sweating andp227puffing , the driver shook his head . " Jesus ! What you guys wo n't go through to get drunk and get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But from pain , rather than exertion . He agreed with the driver wholeheartedly . He had no more business here than he had in a pole-vaulting contest , Baker was right . The four extra days of therapy had helped , especially in loosening up his knee joints , but he was in no shape for this . If it had not been for Landers and Strange witnessing it , he would have given up on the spot and asked to be taken back . All he could do was keep his teeth clenched , and his lips pressed tight together over them . Mainly it was his knees , which were bent and compressed in the short space of the seat-well with its meter , but his thighs ached , too . As if he had been an hour with the therapist . He noted the driver giving him uneasy looks from time to time , as the cab rolled along through the Luxor streets Prell had never seen before . In the ambulance , the only other time he 'd been out , he had been lying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Luxor and the big maples were just beginning to turn . In the huge city park men ambled along the fairways of the golf links swinging their clubs , and young people strolled under the big trees . In the poorer Negro sections and poorer white sections men and women sat quietly on the ramshackle porches , or on the grass of their yards . Every house , even the poorest , had trees . At one spot they passed a high school football field surrounded by trees . On it boys in uniforms scrimmaged and bawled at each other and threw forwardpasses or punted the ball . Prell tried to smile with his clenched teeth at the driver . " Hurtin ' you , hunh ? " the driver said , and reached down under the seat and brought up a pint bottle of whiskey . " Here . " Prell risked relaxing one of his fists which were pressed down into the seat on both sides of his buttocks for support and took a slug of the raw whiskey that burned his nose and throat and made his eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole thing turning into some kind of nightmare . He had one more bad moment getting out of the taxi , and another in the elevator . The elevator came the nearest to becomingthe nightmare . It was small , and slow , and they had to drop the chair 's leg supports in order to close the door . There was only room for himself and the black elevator man . By the timep228they reached the eighth floor Prell 's bent knees seemed to have been in the closed space for a century . But once out of the elevator the painful parts ended . He waited in the hall with the leg rests up again until the others came up behind him . Slowly the pain subsided . A couple of drunk soldiers and their girls wandered along and said hello and offered a drink . When the other two came out of the elevator they all went in together . In the suite the party was already going full blast . Though it was only two-thirty in the afternoon . Strange had given Corello a key to come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Winch was not there . Prell immediately looked all around for him . Later on Winch did come in apparently without Prell seeing him and stationed himself quietly in a corner with , peculiarly , a glass of water . But he did not stay long , and Prell did not see him leave . Landers had asked his Navy flyer friends and their gang from the floor below and immediately Prell was in the room Jan Mitchell , the It cmdr , started a roaring chorus of " For He 's a Jolly Good Fellow " and the other flyers joined him and finally , in a more embarrassed way , the men from the old company joined in . When the song finished , Mitchell raised his arms for quiet and raised his glass toward Prell in a toast . " To the only Medal of Honor winner I have ever had the honor of getting drunk with . " " Hear , hear ! " cried several of the flyers . Suavely Prell shook hands with all of them , and accepted the first drink that was offered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before . From Landers he found out that Commander Mitchell held the Navy Cross , won at Guadalcanal . Prell was about three-quarters drunk when Mitchell began auctioning him off , to the various girls in the suite . Had he not known about the Navy Cross , or had he been cold sober , Prell might have balked . Instead , he went along with it and with Mitchell . Nobody who had won a Navy Cross over Guadalcanal could be all bad . What he garnered by keeping his mouth shut was to find himself in a bedroom with the prettiest girl , getting himself the best blow job he had had since River Street in Honolulu , if not the best he had had ever . Mitchell had n't really auctioned him off . The girls had notp229been asked to pay for him . But Mitchell had appealed to their patriotism , using just the right amount of appealing grace and a carefully leavened sincerity , in a way that would have made the hardest-hearted hooker jump in with a gratis offer to take Prell to bed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a CongressionalMedal of Honor winner , girls , " the It cmdr called , from on top of one of the little cocktail tables , after hollering for silence . " Do you people know what that means ? You may never live to meet another one in your whole lives . This is the highest decoration the good old U.S. of A. can bestow upon one of her sons . Can you do less ? " It was a rhetorical question . Warming to his own oratory , Mitchell clapped his hands . " The problem here is that in order to do and complete the mission he was so carefully entrusted with , our new friend was so thoroughly butchered up in his legs by those dirty Japs that , for the moment at least , he is completely incapacitated in a certain delicate but important physiological , muscular way . Let us say the spirit is willing but the flesh of the thighs for the moment is weak . But what he ca n't do for himself , just now , can be done for him . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ways . And he is on his first pass in a matter of some seven or eight months . He has n't even seen a girl close up in that terrible long length of time . Do I have to say more , ladies ? " Just remember . Probably the only chance any of you will ever have at a Medal of Honor winner . " NOW . What am I bid for him ? Who wants him ? First come , first served . In that good old traditional American fashion . " Mitchell cleverly had made it a joke , and yet , equally cleverly , it was n't a joke .. Five girls responded . Out of the eleven or twelve . First one , then another , then as the idea became less embarrassing , three others . They pushed their way forward and leaped out into the center of the room , laughing and striking poses . Then two others , emboldened by the five , tried to get into the act but were disallowed by Mitchell . The first five Mitchell decided would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and confused search for a cleaning broom with straws . This was finally found and brought forward and handed over to Mitchell . The winner was a girl named Ann Waterfield who worked in town , tall , pageboy blonde , stacked , and exceedingly beautiful . Annie had come with one of the Navy flyers , but was not his special girl . Prell suspected Mitchell of having manipu/lated the broom straws in his favor , but wisely said nothing . Drunk , blushing and embarrassed , and stiff-faced , until Annie rolled his chair away from the others into the bedroom , Prell felt he would owe her a debt for the rest of his natural life . When they finally came back out , after a long time away there , where under strictest orders nobody was allowed to occupy the secondary bed , and where Annie Waterfield had been so accomplished , tender , and sweet , Annie Waterfield started laughing . " Y'all been sayin ' this young man has n't had a pass for only seven or eight months ? He acts like he has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Would you believe three times ? " Three , in the fact of it , was correct . And the second time Annie Waterfield had been able to accomplish something Della Mae Kinkaid never had done . By rolling him on his side and pushing two pillows against his behind for him to roll back on , and then getting her knees astraddle of him , Annie had been able to get onto her feet and squat slowly down over him and fuck his cock without putting any weight at all on his thighs . Della Mae Kinkaid had never done that . The position made his legs ache , but it was worth it . Back out in the crowded , yelling sitting room she did not leave him . She stayed close to him the rest of the evening , always touching him with one hand or the other . This warmed Prell enormously . He certainly had n't wanted to let her go . To somebody else . Della Mae Kinkaid . Prell had thought about Della Mae several times . When he was in the bedroom with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Della Mae doing all these marvelous things to him . But the main bent of his thoughts about Della Mae was quite blunt . It was to hell with Della Mae and let everybody look after himself . All that talk about marriage . That was a lot of shit . Della Mae was bending his ear . If Della Mae wanted to marry , she should find herself some other Medal of Honor winner . Still , it occurred to him it would be great if , relatively quickly , he could teach her that semigymnast 's trick Annie Waterfield had used on him that second time . It was while he was sitting in the chair with Annie Waterfield beside him touching his arm that Johnny Stranger came over from somewhere and from slightly behind Prell put his good hand on Prell 's shoulder . Prell turned his head to look up at himp231and grin . Strange , drunk and red-faced , grinned back down ; and then over one drunkenly bulging eye brought down the eyelid with an almost audible click . " Everything all right ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Slowly , swaying ever so slightly , he leaned over till his mouth was almost at Prell 's ear . " We 're gon na blow every damn nickel of it . Every fucking dime . Nobody 's gon na want for anything , as long as there 's one fucking damn fucking dime of it left . " Prell felt the pressure from the hand increase on his shoulder as Strange pushed himself back erect . Then he sensed rather than saw , because he could n't see that far behind him , that Strange took two paces rearward as the pressure left his shoulder . When he moved his wheelchair to steal a glance a moment later , Strange was standing there , arms folded , leaning on the point of one shoulder against the wall . The stance was so exactly the same way Prell had seen him stand so many times  --  leaning against his kitchen wall back in Wahoo ; against the tent pole of his kitchen fly on the Canal ; against a cocopalm beside his mess tent in New Georgia  --  that it called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole syndrome of memory response . Right now , the drunken red face was suffused with a peculiar look , both above and below his bulging eyes . It was a look of happiness on the surface . But underneath that butter was somethinghard and bitter and so flinty it seemed to Prell a bayonet would not have chipped it . Prell did n't know what it was . And he did n't care very much . It seemed to him now that , without realizing it , out of the corners of his eyes , he had been seeing Strange standing in that same position in one part of the room or another all afternoon and evening . Strange had not been off with a single one of the girls , as far as Prell had noted . Then , while he was thinking this , the heavy hand pressure came on his shoulder and he felt Strange 's mouth come down beside his ear again . " Did you ever eat a pussy ? " " Well , I  --  " Prell began , and then stopped , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know what was going on but he knew enough to know that this was not some joke question . Thep232intensity of the voice precluded that . " Hell , yes , " he said , and grinned up into the red face . " Hell , yes . It 's great . I loved it , " Prell said valiantly . Which was true . Not only with Annie Waterfield , but with a not unworthynumber of other girls . But it was not so long ago that he would have refused to admit it to anyone . The pressure on his shoulder increased again as Strange pushed himself erect once more . When Prell felt he could risk a look , the mess/sgt was standing as before , leaning against the wall . He appeared to be watching what was going on out in the center of the room . Prell put his own gaze back onto the room . The zany Navy flyer Mitchell was in the middle of pulling off some other kind of a crazy college-boy stunt . Suddenly , without preparation , the old movie roster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the living , began to parade across behind Prell 's eyes . He had not had the apparition for so long now that its sudden appearance shook him . Slowly , each hollow-eyed face turned back to smile wistfully , sadly , before it moved on and faded . Faded into whatever Godawful night . God , what they would n't all of them have given , Prell thought , just to have been here . Probably it was the memory syndrome Strange had called up in him which had caused it . The only sane answer to it was to point out forcefully , as forcefully as possible , that he was here and they were not . On the metal arm of the wheelchair his right hand holding his drink began to tremble , so that the ice in the glass made a faint , constant tinkling . Beside him Annie Waterfield put her own right hand over his and stopped the tinkling , and made a quick motion with her mouth to him that was like a kiss . Prell threw her a wink . In the cab @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt no anguish at all when he was stuffed into the front seat-well , or when he was pulled bodily from it to be stuck back into the unfolded wheelchair by Landers and Strange . The driver of this second cab was not nearly so nice or so helpful as the first driver had been . It did n't matter . " It was one of the best nights of my life , " Prell told them , and the driver , again . For maybe the twentieth time . " I wish it had gone on forever . " It was while Landers , drunk too , was pushing him back to the leg wards , with his cane hung over the back of the chair , that Landers told him Winch was going back to limited duty in ap233couple of days . Winch was going to Second Army Headquarters as chief of the G-1 personnel section , probably with a raise in grade to junior warrant officer . To Prell , still drunk as he was , the new news about Winch sounded like a deep knell tolling the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about getting out of his new uniform with the help of the night man . Finally in bed and alone , he lay awake a while thinking about it . What was going to happen to him , when all the others were gone ? First Winch would go . Then , Landers . Then , Strange . Finally , Prell would be left . To continue with his painful leg therapy to see whether , finally , he would walk on them again . Still going through the goddam daily therapy . Still trying to learn to goddam walk . What on earth was going to become of him ? All he had ever wanted to do was stay in the Army . How were you going to stay in the Army without legs to walk ? Next morning , as if in answer to his question , he was delivereda typed invitation direct from Col Stevens this time , to go downtown and make another speech . This one was to the Luxor Ladies Clubs , Combined . The first had been hugely successful and the Ladies Clubs had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Badly hungover though he was , of course he accepted . There was n't really a choice . It occurred to Prell that this was to be his future way of life apparently , his future path of duty , if he wanted to stay in the Army . Nobody had said so yet . But Prell could smell it coming , the way an animal can smell snow , or a storm coming.  |p234Landers  woke with much less of a hangover than Prell . More used to the heavy drinking luxury than Prell was by now , his body was getting better at assimilating it . But as he pulled the GI blanket and sheet up to his neck and lay listening to the ward man going down the line waking the guys , he was transfixed by something far worse than a hangover . The big bell at the head of the ward was ringing its short , hard , frightening blasts , but it was n't that . He was used to that . His whole system was infused with a sharp pure panic . Landers knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole big party to remember what it was he had done so wrong . It was right there in the forefront of his mind . He remembered that he drunkenly had told Prell all about Winch going back to duty , on the way pushing him back to the wards . And he had been asked precisely not to do just that . Jerkily , with nerves made jumpy by both hangover and adeep , hollow , awful guilt , Landers yanked on his pajama pantsand slippers to hurry up and get to the bathroom first and shave . It was Strange who had told Landers about Winch 's impendingreturn to duty . Landers had been sitting with him outdoorsp235loafing in the fall sunshine , while the two of them waited for Prell to get his folding wheelchair . Winch had told Strange he would be leaving within a week . Then , after telling Landers , Strange had expressly asked Landers not to talk about it . Particularly , he did not want Landers to tell Prell . Landers had asked him why . Strange had shrugged and moved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come to associate with all of Strange 's more complex , profounder ideas , he said he did not think Prell was up to it yet . Prell was still drawn too tight , still too much up in the air . About what might happen with his legs . He would n't be able to digest the idea that Winch finally might be leaving them , leaving the company , moving on . Landers had simply nodded . He was not so sure he was up to it himself . The idea that Winch might not be there for aid and advice when Landers needed him left a big empty hole in Landers . But he had never believed Prell felt that same way about Winch . Astonishingly , it was as if Strange read his mind . Again , inarticulately , Strange had moved his head and shrugged . That Prell hated Winch did not mean Prell thought Winch was an incompetent , Strange said with no prompting . Just the reverse . Prell would never have hated a man whose professional opinionshe had contempt for . No ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no hate . They should give Prell a week , Strange said , or two weeks . Before they told him . He needed sufficient time for the therapy on his legs to start to work . Besides , in the second place , if it was an accomplished fact , with Winch already gone , there would be a fatality about it that would make it more acceptable to Prell . Landers had nodded again . And had promised he would not mention Winch 's leaving to Prell . Privately , he remembered how more than once it had struck him how intricate and complicatedthese relationships were between these Regular Army men , which seemed so simple on the surface . And he marveled again at the really deep understanding of them Strange seemed to have . College people . College people , like himself , who had a tendency to think of themselves as more sensitive , and called men like these guys ignorant , and uncomplicated , and insensitive , did n't know what the fuck they were talking about . And had probably never known any . Landers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But Landers would rather have beenp236like them , than any college people he had ever met . Drunk , happy , he had gone to bed last night after the party thinking these same thoughts over again , a second time . And had waked up to most unwelcome this . It appeared that his mind had blanked out , on certain parts of the big , riotously boisterous party . There were whole stretches he had no memory of . But his mind had not blanked out this most awful , most irresponsible thing he 'd done . His mind had kept it right there , all ready for him , to stew and seethe and fret and agonize over this morning , with this sense of awful guilt . How could he possibly have made such a gaffe ? How could he possibly have forgotten , ignored his promise ? Shaved , he bolted down his breakfast so fast and nervously , he gave himself a bad bellyache . Then he sat , nursing the bellyache , tapping his feet in their slippers on the polished floor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over and he was free , he took off across the half-mile width of the hospital to Strange 's ward , as fast as his bad leg would carry him , to see Strange and confess what he had done . Maybe there was some way Strange could fix it . Luckily he hurried , Strange was already in uniform , preparing to take off for town and his new suite . He had already given a key to one of the guys from the company , who had a morning pass and had gone in ahead to round up some women . " Come on along , " the mess/sgt said . " The more the merrier . I 'll wait on you while you change . " Landers stopped him with a raised hand . " I 've got to tell you what I did , " Landers said , and bubbled it all out breathlessly . " It was a terrible thing . A terrible thing . I was drunk . But that 's no excuse . It was on the way back to the wards . " Strange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he did was smile a sad little half-smile with the corner of his mouth , and make his shrug . To Landers the rebuke seemed greater because of that . He would have preferred a storm of abuse . " I guess he 'll just have to live with it , " Strange said . " A little sooner , is all . We all got things we have to live with a little sooner than we 're ready for , I reckon . " " I suppose . I ca n't tell you how sorry I am , " Landers added in a low voice . Nothing he could find to say seemed to loosen that awful guilt . " I reckon he 'll survive it , " Strange said , sadly , and laid his good hand on Landers ' shoulder with a light slap . " People do allp237sorts of things when they 're drunk they would n't do sober . No avoiding that . It ai nt that bad . " He flexed the fingers of the bad hand , that still wore the plaster brace . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'll wait for you outside at the taxi stand , in the sunshine . We ai nt going to have all that much more of it , I do n't think . Even here in the good old Southland . " It was in the taxi going in that he told Landers about the checking account he 'd opened , and the $7000 in cash . He told Landers he intended to blow every nickel of it while he and the remaining guys from the company were still here . Landers still was n't over the other thing , but Strange seemed to have forgotten Prell . " That 's an awful lot of money to blow , and just burn up , " Landers said cautiously . " You can do a lot with seven thousand bucks . " " Like what ? " " I do n't know . I do n't know what you want . You could start buying a restaurant . You 're a cook , and restaurateur , are n't you ? " " Do n't want anything like that , " Strange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nt going to last long , here . At a hundred bucks a day ? For that suite ? That 's only seventy days of suite , right there . " " Did you ever ask them about paying monthly rates ? " Landerssaid . " No , " Strange said . " I have n't . " " Say , " Landers said , " listen . I 've got something like two thousandbucks at home myself . What about me throwing mine in with yours ? " Suddenly he felt elated , and excited . " That would give us twenty more days of suite , if we needed it . " " All right , " Strange said . But then he raised one admonitory horny finger of his good hand . " Make certain you wo n't be sorry . " " Hell , " Landers said . " Say , I 'll tell you what ! " Strange said , excitedly . He had been looking out the window , at the big city park , Overton Park , that the taxis passed on their way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why do n't we have us a goddam picnic ? " Landers felt astonished . Apparently , Strange had put the matter of Prell totally out of his mind . " Okay , why not ? " handers said . " We 'll get the booze and the women and whatever guys arep238there , and buy some food , rent a taxi for the day , and come out to this damned park for the day , " Strange said . " How about that ? " He too seemed elated , suddenly . " We 'll have ourselves a hell of a damned picnic day , by God . " It was not till they had had three drinks , from the illegal pint Strange bought from the driver , that Strange brought up the other thing that apparently was on his mind . He glanced nervously at the back of the driver 's head , as they moved through the streets of downtown . Then he leaned over to Landers with a conspiratorial air . " Did you ever eat a girl 's pussy ? " he whispered . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means for a joke . He began to frame in his mind some sort of joke answer . Then he saw , or sort of sensed , that Strange was n't joking . Strange was asking in deadly seriousness . " Why do you want to know ? " Landers asked in a normal tone , to buy time . Strange made a violent braking motion with the open palm of his good hand , for softness of voice . " Do n't be embarrassed , God damn it , " he whispered . " ' I 'm serious . " " Well , if you put it that way . Well yes . I have , " Landers whispered . " Did you like it ? " Strange whispered . " Well yes . I liked it . In fact , I loved it , " Landers whispered back . Strange was nodding to himself . Thoughtfully . " Are you good at it ? " Everything was still in whispers , kept low by Strange 's constantadmonition . " Well . Well , I do n't know that there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's this girl , Martha Prentiss ? Who 's around the Peabody ? That loves to suck cock . " " I 've had her pointed out to me , but I do n't know her . Never met her . " Whisper . " I picked her up . She gave me a few pointers . But , hell . All it takes is a lot of gentleness , and a very wet tongue . " Whisper . Strange nodded , but did n't answer . " I guess you know what a clitoris is , I guess ? " Landers whispered . " Yes , damn it . I know , " Strange whispered . " Well , " Landers shrugged lamely . " Does it smell ? "  | " Sure . It smells . It smells good . " " Does n't it smell fishy ? " " It smells fishy . But it 's not really fishy . It smells  --  Do you know the word fecund ? " Strange shook his head . " Fecund means rich . Like rich earth . Rich for growing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ripe , " Landers whispered . He began to be afraid he was sounding too poetic , and stopped . " Ripe , " Strange whispered sourly . " I 'll bet it smells ripe . " Their faces were hardly a foot apart , and Strange stared into Landers ' eyes intensely . " Does n't it smell pissy ? " " Well yeah . A little bit . But you do n't mind that . At least , I do n't . But that 's only at first . After a little , it does n't smell pissy . " " Does n't it taste ? " " No . Does n't taste at all . Has no taste whatever . Tastes like whatever you 've had in your mouth before . A cigarette . Whiskey . A steak . " Strange nodded in silence , his intent eyes not budging from Landers ' . " Say , what is all this ? " Landers whispered . " Oh , there 's this girl , " Strange whispered with elaborate indifference . " Wants me to blow her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everybody does it . " Landers grinned . " Show me the man who does n't eat cunt , and I 'll show you the man whose wife I can steal , ' " he grinned , quoting in a whisper the ancient joke . Strange did not laugh . Strange just stared at him . " I 'll tell you one thing , " Landers whispered . " Too damn many of them taste like soap . " " Taste like what ? " " Soap . So many girls are so ashamed of them , and so afraid they 'll smell , that they 're constantly scrubbing the hell out of them . And they taste like soap . " " Aw , shit , " Strange whispered , " you 're a damned expert . " " No , no . I learned it all right here . Or almost all . " They were so close together , and Strange was staring so intently , that Strange 's eyes were like two bright blue searchlights , flooding Landers ' face . In that light , just about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the back of the driver 's headp240was not cocked . By the back of his head , he was going right on driving , totally unconcerned . After a long moment Strange relaxed back into the seat , staring straight ahead . " Times are changing everywhere , " he said , to no one in particular . Though said in a normally loud tone of voice , it came out muffled . The cab was already onto Union Street , still heading in , movinguphill toward Main Street and the big river , invisible beyondit . As the driver swung wide to make the U turn to stop in front of the Peabody , Strange grinned and said , without expression , in a normal tone , the one word , " Thanks . " Strange had not forgotten about the picnic . The picnic , in fact , turned out almost exactly as Strange had imagined it . Exceptit was even more pleasant , more fun . There were four men from the old company waiting in the suite and they had picked up some girls in pairs and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bar of the Claridge up on Main Street . Landers noted that without exception the four were guys who had been at Kilraineylonger , and had run out of money . Strange was obviously concentrating his largesse and his giant spending on guys who no longer had money . That part was okay with Landers . He was willing to do exactlythe same with his smaller sum , as soon as he got it down here . And by that time , he thought , Prell would be further along with his therapy . He badly wanted to do something for Prell . Landers had tried to do what Strange apparently had done so easily with the faux pas of last night , and put it entirely out of his mind . But Landers could n't do it as well and Prell kept coming back to his mind in some comparative fashion almost all the time . And each time , Landers had the same awful feeling he had had that morning . Even to him , it seemed out of all proportion . Then , when he had fallen asleep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big trees in one of the big glades of the park , the dream or vision of the waterless platoons and his full canteen of water on the dry hill on New Georgia , suddenly came back to plague him . Again they were begging him for his water and he would not give them any . He woke suddenly , choking back a cry . The brunette girl who was with him , he did not remember which one she was or who , quickly grasped his biceps with her five fingers and smiled and winked down at him , and crooned soothingly . She apparently had done it many times before and knew what to do.  |p241Landers  sat up , and reached for another drink . It was the first time in a long time that that dream had imposed itself on him and he could n't help but wonder , Why now ? Fortunately , there was plenty still left to drink . If it had been a great , warm , sunny picnic , it had also certainly been a heavy drinking one . Strange had brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could think of and get hold of . He had , at Landers ' instigation , even brought along a couple of bottles of French wine ; but the wine had languished . Not even Landers drank it . Like everybody else , he preferred shots of whiskey with cold beer chasers . By the time it began to get chilly and they repaired to the hotel , they were all of them , including the girls , quite drunk . Strange did not seem to show it as much as the rest . Though Landers was sure he had drunk just as much . Landers had been curious , after their conversation , and covertly watched him with the women . But it was hard to tell about Strange . Strange had divided his time about equally between Annie Waterfield , Prell 's girl of last night , and Frances Highsmith . Frances was a girl who had been around the bunch a lot , and whom Landers had made it with a few times , and whom he was sure Strange had been to bed with at least once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Strange had kept Frances with him and had ridden out to the park with her in one of the three cabs they had had to hire , and Landers had thought , Ah ha , that 's the one ! But then halfway through the picnic he had redirected his attention to Annie and had gone off walking to sit with her across on the other side of the glade from where they had spread the blankets , and Landers had thought , Ah no , it was Annie ! But before they left Strange went back with Frances , and rode back with her . But then when they were all settled in the suite , Strange left Frances again and sat with Annie and a bottle of bourbon that was beside them . Frances appeared to be getting irritated . But Annie Waterfield did not . At that point Landers went to bed and to sleep , not knowing who to bet on , or even whether he should bet on either . And not much caring . He had been afraid to go to sleep again because of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the park , and all the hot sunshine , had done him in in a way that was more than he could handle . Even the thought of having the dream again in his sleep could not keep him awake . Besides , the girl , whose name was Mary Lou Salgraves it turned out , was there and went to bedp242with him , and was willing to hold his head against her naked breasts while he slept . Landers went straight off to sleep . Withouteven attempting to fuck ; without even a hard-on . And Mary Lou seemed to like it as well that way , or like it even better . He slept for three hours before the dream woke him again , his conscious mind rising befuddled out of sleep but , even befuddled , already trying to choke off any noise or cry he might be making . As he came awake , he realized Mary Lou had her hand over his mouth , and her other hand was stroking his head . It was she who had waked him , he realized , as his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm sorry to wake you , " she said as she took her hand off his mouth , " but you were beginnin ' to make noises and holler in your sleep . I thought you 'd want me to . " It was curiously as though she had done it all so many times that she knew exactly what to do without asking any questions . They were alone in the big bedroom he noted , and that included the smaller cot-type bed turned endways by the door . " Yeah . Yeah , sure . Thanks , " Landers said in a sleep-roughenedvoice . " Thanks . " " It was all somethin ' about water , " Mary Lou said . " Water , water . Are you thirsty ? " " No , " Landers said , then corrected himself . " Yes . Yes , I 'm thirsty for some whiskey and soda . " " Comin ' right up , " Mary Lou answered , smiling at him . She got up slowly , and then put her dress on without bothering with the underwear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his crotch . " You 're some girl , you know that , Mary Lou ? " " Why , thank you , sir , " she smiled . Her chin dimpled . Outside in the suite 's sitting room Strange was still sitting with Annie Waterfield , talking . His voice sounded a little thicker , but his eyes were quick . The level in the bourbon bottle had gone down appreciably . " Well , " the mess/sgt said from his seat . " You get some rest ? " Landers nodded , stretching . Mary Lou handed him his drink . Strange and Annie were the only two left in the suite . The four other old-company men and their four girls had disappeared . Frances Highsmith also had disappeared . The door to the other bedroom was wide open , and nobody was in there . It was eight-thirty , and strangely quiet and peaceful.  |p243Strange  smiled at Landers fondly , from across the room . " The others all went off to get some nigger barbeque out on Poplar someplace . They were getting a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to some movie . " He grinned , a little sheepishly . " Frances has left us , too . Frances was the girl , in fact , I was telling you about before . " " I think Frances ' nose was a little out of joint , " Annie said . " She acted like she had some previous claim on Sergeant Strange . " She smiled with sweet feminine bitchery . " She 'll be all right , " Strange grinned . " There 's plenty of fellows , and plenty of hotel suites , around . " So Annie had won , Landers thought . Or Frances Highsmith had lost . At least , now he knew which one of them it was who had asked Strange to eat her . All along , Landers had thought it was probably Frances . But he wanted to laugh . If Strange thought he was onto something different with Annie , Strange did n't know what kind of tree he was barking up . Landers stared at Annie , his mind struck suddenly empty . He had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their own fierce little pecking order going here , fought over with just as much blood thirst as any other group of young females . The only difference was that the time span was shortenedby the war , and the pride of ownership telescoped to three days or five days , or one night . So they fought over the men night by night . Then they started over , like any divorcee . Landers wondered who Mary Lou had nosed out , to get him . Or he to get her ? Mary Lou had certainly made it a lot easier for him today . Landers sat down in an overstuffed armchair with his drink , and motioned for Mary Lou to come sit by him on the arm . The new drink , on top of all the booze he 'd put away already , hit him swiftly . He sat tasting the strange quiet in the suite , his arm around Mary Lou 's hips . It was such a moment of peace , in all the hot scrambling for cunt , and liquor , and life . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his own cups and already apparentlywell past Landers , winked back , his one eyelid closing and then opening very slowly . Strange appeared to be savoring the quiet peace , too . Two hours later the two of them had had their first fight in Luxor , with some Navy personnel . About seven Navy person/nel , to be exact . Fortunately , not all of the enemy became engaged . It would be easy to say it was because of all the booze they had put away . But there was more to it than that for Landers . The four of them had gone down for a quiet , peaceful dinner in the main dining room downstairs . The old-fashioned main dining room off the lobby , with its wall paneling and quiet old colored gentlemen waiters , had in general been kept back out of the way of the huge influx of wild-eyed , fire-breathing servicemen , and was the place for that kind of dinner . Old Luxor families still took their older and younger generations there for family dinner outings . And Strange and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mood they had had upstairs . Afterward , they had gone across the lobby to the bar for a drink , Strange picking up a bottle at the package store in the corridor . They could have gone back upstairs . And none of them knew why they went to the bar . The truth was , they were feeling affectionate and , if not in love , felt warm and close . Like lovers , they wanted other people around for contrast . Needed the audience , Landers thought sourly , later . The contrast they got in the bar was immediate and cataclysmic . The whole place was packed . And the noise level was commensurate . They got a table for four , luckily , because a party of four got up to leave as they came in . Right behind them crammed against the wall was a long table filled on the three open sides with these Navy people , ranging upward in rank and topped off with two chiefs , one of them an old duffer in his dress whites . Strange got up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he had poured a drink . And at the same time , behind him , another sailor came in to the long table . It was then the old duffer in dress whites reached over a huge hand and grabbed Strange 's seat away from the table . The white uniform had lots of unfamiliar WW I ribbons above the left breast , and he had gold hash marks literally all the way up his left sleeve from the wrist to his insignia . Something blazed up in Landers ' mind like a fire ball . Though the two girls hardly seemed to notice the theft . Keeping his voice carefully empty of rage , Landers stepped over to the long table . " That seat 's taken . "  | " There was nobody in it , " the old chief said . " Yes there was . My friend just went out to the pisser . " Still politely . But the red fire ball had already exploded . " Did n't you hear him ? " the second chief , who was younger and in blues , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it was free . " " Yeah . You want it , take it , " the old chief said , and grinned down the table at his mob . " Okay . I will , " Landers said evenly . The rage in him was threatening to overflow . But he held it in . And waited . He waited , until he saw Strange come in through the outside door . A full minute , or minute and a half . Strange of course marked them right away . When he saw Strange had seen them , he signaled him with his eyebrows . Meanwhile , the Navy personnel all just stood or sat , however they had been before , looking at him , waiting too . Waiting for him . " Well ? " the younger chief said , smiling with contempt . " You going to take it ? " They really do n't know , Landers thought . Who we are . While Strange came on , he studied them . The old chief in white on his left was still seated . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was between them . Beyond the younger chief was the new man , his hand still on the stolen chair . The others were all seated . Behind him Landers heard Strange say softly , " Go ahead . Bust him . " He swung with his right hand first at the old chief . It went in accurately alongside the nose just under the right eye , cutting deep . Without bothering to look at the effect , he swung with his left at the chief in blues , rolling his body , like a whip , a punch that was half hook , half uppercut . It caught the young chief two inches back from the point of his chin . Landers heard his teeth clap together . He went down . Landers swung his body to take care of the third man coming in , but Strange had already accounted for him . Swinging his good , left hand in a hook to the belly that swung the moving man bad ( toward himself , Strange clapped him alongside the head and jaw with the plaster plate bound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ third man went down . Meanwhile , Landers ' second chief was coming back up , valiantlybut slowly . Landers hit him with both hands , hook andp246short rights , in the belly and in the face . One , two ; one , two ; one two three four . Faster than the eye could count . And as he landed each punch Landers shouted insanely . " Pay ! " he yelled . " Pay ! Pay , goddam you ! Pay , pay , pay ! " The chief in blues sagged down . Beyond him Strange grabbed a water pitcher by its handle from a table , ready to crack it in half on a table edge and turn it into a weapon . His right hand was held ready to slap again . " Just come on , " he warned in a hiss , as insanely . " Just come on . " The four seated Navy men looked up at the two insane men , astonishment spread over their faces . None was inclined to get up , and wisely they sat still . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Behind Landers a tall , kindly-looking soldier got awkwardly to his feet , and put one arm half around Landers . Landers spun , ready to hit again . " No , no . Do n't swing . Do n't swing , " the kindly-looking soldiersaid . He looked worried . " Do n't swing . You guys better get out of here . Right now . The MPs will be here in seconds . I 've seen them . " Landers swung back to the table . He had one satisfying look at the old chief sprawled against the wall , his chair overturned , bright blood red from below his eye down over the dress whites . " Pay ! " he screamed at all of them . " Pay , you cocksuckers ! Goddamyou , pay ! " Strange had heard the kindly-looking soldier , too , and carefullyput his uncracked water pitcher back on its table . He started backing toward the door , his good hand gripping Landers ' arm and pulling him . " You girls go on , you leave , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Landers followed him . " Do n't forget my cane , " he called , " do n't forget my cane . " At the door a huge MP already blocked the way , his hand on his black holster , and stopped them . He looked in at the nowquietbar , inspecting the carnage , then looked at the two of them . " God damn , " he said wearily . " You guys . All right , go on . Git . Out that way . " He pointed on down the corridor , away from the lobby . " It goes to the street . Move it , damn it . " " We got a room in the hotel , " Strange said breathlessly . " A suite , we got . "  | " Then go around the block , and come back the other way , " the MP said . " My partner 'll be here in a minute , damn it . He ai nt as sympathetic . " Strange was already moving , pulling along with his good hand Landers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beginning to laugh . Landers was not laughing . " Appreciate it , " Strange called . " Go fuck , " the MP called back , and stepped inside . " Those dirty fuckers , " Landers was muttering , " those dirty fuckers . " " Come on , " Strange said , laughing . " We got to move it . " " Let them see something , " Landers muttered . " Let them see something . " It was difficult , going clear around the block with Landers limping so badly . He had pulled or turned something in his ankle , and the pain was bothering him . So Strange led them through an alley beyond the hotel , which went around it and came back out on Union . Thus as they slipped in through the revolving door and across the lobby , they were able to see the MPs and some medics leading the battered Navy group out from the bar . The old chief in his bloody dress whites was on a stretcher , out . " You do n't think I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the crowded elevator . " No , " Strange said . " He was just knocked out . " Strange was still laughing , and still breathless . Suddenly his eyes glinted meanly . " And what if you did ? " " He was the one who took the chair , " Landers whispered . " Just like that . Without so much as a by your leave . But I would n't want to hurt him . " Fortunately Strange had already given Annie a key and the girls were in the suite waiting . And immediately there were all the breathless , laughing recapitulations of battle . Everybody had a viewpoint and story of his own to expound . Landers came out as the unquestioned hero , but Landers was not taking part . He sat off by himself quietly , nursing his ankle , ministered to by Mary Lou who brought him drinks . He kept popping his knuckles and said nothing . " Let them learn something , " he would mutter to no one every so often , " let them learn something . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barked but he would not let anybody doc/tor them . " You must have hit teeth somewhere , " Strange said happily . Very shortly after , the four other old-company men and their girls came back in , and the stories had to be told again . " I tell you , " Annie Waterfield said , " I never saw anything like it . It was all so fast . After you left , that tall soldier ? Who warned you against the MPs ? He went over to them where they were pickin ' up that poor chief petty officer in blues , and tryin ' to bring the old one to , slappin ' his face , and he told them who you all were . " " What do you mean , told them who we were ? " Strange said . " He did n't know us . " " He figured it out because of Marion 's cane and your hand plaster . You do n't want to mess with them , he told those sailors . Those are overseas men from the hospital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with them . They 're all crazy . That 's exactly what he said . Someone asked him how he knew , and he made this awful grin and said , Because I 'm one of them . ' Then he pulled up his pants leg , and showed them his artificial leg . " It was just awful . Terrible . " " Maybe he 's seen us around the hospital , " Strange said . " But I 've never seen him . Have you ? " he asked Landers . Landers only shook his head . " No . " " What did you mean ? " Annie Waterfield asked him , " when you kept hollerin ' Pay ? " " Hollering Pay ? " Landers said . " Pay ? " " Yes . Every time you hit somebody you kept hollerin ' Pay ! Every time , Pay ! Pay , you sons of bitches ! Pay , pay , pay ! ' " " I do n't know , " Landers said hollowly . " I do n't remember saying that . I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drink from Mary Lou . But he thought he did know . It was easy to say it was because of the booze they had put away . That they were drunk . But Landers knew there was something more . Something inside him . Aching to get out . There was something in him aching to get out , but in a way that only a serious fight or series of serious fights would let it get out . Anguish . Love . And hate . And a kind of fragile , short-lived happiness . Which had to be short-lived , if he was going out of this fucking hospital and back into the fucking war . It had just built up in him . There was no way on earth to explain it to anybody , though . Not without sounding shitty . There was no way to say it.  |p249It  had been building up in him ever since that episode on the train with the Air Force sergeant , on his trip home . It was in his fight with his father over the medals . In that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ failed so abominably . It had grown and built in him at an even quicker pace , since his awful boo-boo he had made with Prell . Landers thought that , probably , it had been building in him even longer . Growing . Ever since he was sitting on that damned evil hilltop in New Georgia , with all those other weeping men with the white streaks down their dirty faces , watching the men below in the valley whanging and beating and shooting and killing each other , with such stern , disruptive , concentrated effort . Anguish . Love . And hate . And happiness . The anguish was for himself . And every poor slob like him , who had ever suffered fear , and terror , and injury at the hands of other men . The love , he did n't know who the love was for . For himself and everybody . For all the sad members of this flawed , misbegotten , miscreatedrace of valuable creatures , which was trying and failing with such ruptured effort to haul itself up out of the mud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hate , implacable , unyielding , was for himself and every other who had ever , in the name of whatever good , maimed or injured or killed another man . The happiness ? The happiness was the least , and best , and most important , because the most ironic . The happiness was from those few moments in the fight , when the bars were down , when the weight of responsibility lifted , and he and every man could go in , and destroy and be destroyed , without fear of consequences , with no thought of debt . In short , do all the things they should n't and could n't want to do , or want others to do , when they were responsible . What a melange . All tossed up in the air and churned around until one element was indistinguishable from another , and the steam from the whole boiling stew seethed and billowed until its pressure forced a safety crack in even the strongest selfcontrol . Landers suspected something like that was pushing Strange on , too , from the thin explosive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called in a soft but ringing voice , " Go ahead . Bust him . " It was somewhat the feeling that if all of these awful things had been done to so many of them , somebody was going to havep250to pay , pay , pay , including himself , themselves . What better way was there for all to pay , pay than in a fight , in which he himself , they themselves , were taking lumps and damage , and getting smashed around , too . It did n't make any sense . None whatsoever . That was why you could n't tell it to anybody . You could n't tell that , even to Strange . Landers was about resigned to never being able to tell it . Did it mean the two of them had a future of such episodes to look forward to ? Landers knew somewhere inside of him that he had n't had enough of it , even yet . And he did n't think Johnny Stranger had , either . It seemed to promise ill for any future . When everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to wait quite a long time , he took Mary Lou ( Salgraves , was it ? ) and hobbled to bed and locked the door and fucked her and made love to her until her tongue was hanging out and even Mary Lou did n't want any more . He was pretty sure Johnny Stranger was doing the same thing on the other side of the suite , behind the other locked door . That great sage who had said so wittily that a man did n't want sex after he had had a fight , did n't know what he was talking about . On the way home in the cab at five in the morning , drunk like the others and riding with all four of them , Landers felt Strange lean against his shoulder and put his mouth against his ear . " She wanted it , too . " Strange coughed a drunken hiccup . " I did n't do it , " Strange whispered , drunkenly , so the other drunks could n't hear . " I did n't do it . I almost did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do it . "  |p251Johnny  Stranger had made up his mind to go back to town the next day . Strange had decided that point before he left the hotel . He had to get this thing settled with Frances Highsmith . In the taxi , after he had drunkenly whispered his predicament to Landers , he drunkenly roared his intention to the other oldcompanymen . " Everybody 's invited . Anybody who 's free and wants to come , is welcome . On any day . If there are days I ca n't be there , somebody will have a key to the suite . Enough 's been paid for two weeks , and it might as well be used . After two weeks , we 'll see . But I see no reason why not keep it . As long as any of us are here . Trynor will go ahead in tomorrow and open up . Trynor'sgot a morning pass . " Trynor was an old-company pfc , a short blocky muscular man from Springfield , Illinois , who was riding in the front seat . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Strange did it by chunks , waiting to breathe and continue , whenever he was interrupted by the cat calls , Yankee screams , and Rebel yells that kept issuing from here and there in the cab . When hep252finished , there was a concerted shout of all three types of yell by everyone . They were all six riding back together in the same taxi . Four were in the back seat , two were with the driver in front . They had bought three bootleg pints off the driver , who did n't carry fifths , and were plying the laughing driver with drink , as well as plying themselves . Arms were thrust out of the open windowswaving the illicit bottles , and the calls and Rebel yells followed them down the boulevard like a fading memory . The yells were meant to wake the sleeping civilians whose peace and rest they had all fought so hard for , and paid out so much blood to preserve . Strange , drunk , looking at them , and squeezed into the back seat beside Landers , felt a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carefully put down . Frances Highsmith ought to see this . See and understand it . It was entirely possible Strange 's chief surgeon Col Curran would not allow Strange to go in , tomorrow . Strange had not tried to get in touch with him since returning from Cincinnati , and Curran had not joined the morning rounds group in person . So Strange had not really seen him . Even so , unless he had strict direct orders from Curran himself not to go , Strange meant to go and track down , find , get together with , and have this whole damned thing out with damned Frances Highsmith . It had been two days now since Strange had acquired his Peabody suite . It had been four more days that he had waited to get it . Add one more day , that it had taken him to get the check deposited in a bank , get organized , start spending money and writing checks , and it was a week since he had last seen Linda , or talked to her , in Cincinnati . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But Strange could not see that it had . He still was much better off when he was around lots of other people , for example . If the people were having a big drunken party , he was better off yet . If he himself was drunk too , as was usually the case , it was even better . And if he himself had a woman or choice of women to be drunk with at the drunken party among all the people , it was the best of all for him . But he had to get this other thing , with Frances Highsmith , settled . It was only when Strange was not with a woman , was sober , not at a party , and not around lots of people , that he brooded.  |p253But  , then ! Then , it could be a veritable fucking living hell . Brooding over Linda Sue . And her Air Force It col . Who went down on her , and things like that . And came from Southampton or wherever the hell that place was on Long Island , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he was at the hospital , Strange had gotten to hate the hospital . When he checked in at his ward , it was nearly six A.M. All around on the dark ward were the quiet , breathing sounds of deep sleep . The sleepy night ward man , bent over his check-in roster under the shaded lamp on his desk , shook his head . " Jesus . I do n't see how you guys do it . " Strange could have told him , but did n't . Strange felt a little fuzzy at morning rounds . And his face felt puffy . But as soon as he saw Curran was n't there , only Maj Hogan , he was more than ready to rush into a clean uniform and pick up his day pass and get the hell out of there . " You 're getting in later and later , Strange , " Hogan called irascibly . " Since you got back from Cincinnati this last time . " They both knew there was nothing Hogan could do about it . And anyway Strange had this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . In the cab going back in he was alone . He did n't like it , but there was nobody else waiting at the cab stand . And the thought of waiting around until someone he knew showed up was unbearable . He sat back and tried to enjoy the delicious November weather , but he could n't . Pleasant hot sunshine pouring down over everything , drenching the park woods and the trees and lawns . The trees turning their last shades of bronze and yellow and red . The grass still bright green in the expanse of park sward and the private lawns . How long was it going to keep up ? Not a cloud in the long stretch of sunny Mississippi sky . It was no good . He could enjoy it mentally , but he could not enjoy it with his insides . He bought an illegal half pint from the driver , and began guzzling it , taking sips and hot pleasant gutburningswallows of the raw whiskey . One of the things that rode up on the waves of alcohol fumes mounting his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night . And that he would like another for tonight . Ile should n't have picked up that water pitcher . And he would n't let himself do something like that again . He was gladp254they had n't pushed him to using it . Strange did n't want to accidentally kill or cripple anybody . Just a good clean fight . Strange had put a lot of deep thought on the matter of Frances Highsmith . And why she had to be his first blow job . Even the most superficial analysis spotlighted Frances . She was the first girl he had fucked back home in the States , other than Linda Sue . Frances was also the first girl anywhere to ask him to go down on her . And even more important , at least to Strange , it was Frances who had warned him he could lose his wife if he did n't take better care of her in bed . Frances deserved to be the first . By every moral right . Strange had realized this last night , when Annie Waterfield , too , had asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really asked him , exactly . She had just assumed that he would . When she had started to go down on him , all laid out flat on the bed as he was , she had stretched that long , long , lean , beautiful leg out full length over him , and then had put her knee and her long lean rounded lovely thigh on the other side of his chest on the bed . Strange had lain looking up at all the exposed woman-flesh , just above his face . She was pretty well exposed , in that position . There was a delicious , beautiful , little hollow on the inner surface of each thigh just where it met the trunk . These shaded into the thick , dark shadow of her crotch hair . In the middle of this thicket was the pink gape of her cunt , the two inner lips , hangingand open , joined to form the sheath , curling and pink , of the clitoris . After a moment , Strange put his hand up and began to manipulate her there . Annie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were , and turned her head slightly without losing contact . " You do n't suck pussy ? All right . Just do that . Ahhh . That 's it . But put a couple of fingers inside me . " She went back to sucking . It was certainly tempting . To say the least . Why did he suddenlyfind it so terribly desirable ? Maybe it was that delicious exposure of her position . But then , like some blocking mechanism lowering an iron inflexible curtain , Strange knew that it was Frances who deservedto be his first one . Deserved it . He owed it . It was easy enough for Strange to see that this was some sophomoric , boy 's , or boy scout 's , moralism . Easy enough for him even to state it publicly . That did not make it any less binding . He had to back away.  |p255Strange  had gone on manipulating her with his hand , doing it as she had told him . When she came , it was with a gush of unintelligible words and an outpour of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the first time in his life , Strange became aware , that he knew for sure he had made a woman come . It was no soft ah-ing and oh-ing , like when they faked it . He realized that making a woman come was one of the better things in living . None of this changed the way he felt about old Frances . Or the way he felt about Linda Sue . Strange had expended a great deal of deep thought on the subject of Linda Sue , also . More time and more depth than he had spent on Frances , and almost all of it anguished . One matter he had gone deepest into was the subject of jealousy . He had a lot of that . But only where it concerned Linda Sue . One of the first things he 'd noted about all the girls of Luxor was that , however many times he 'd screwed one , and however much he might like her , it did not matter to him who she fucked or might be fucking when he was not with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No . With Linda , his imagination worked overtime , and doubleovertime . Always , of course , with that Air Force It col of hers . The " aeronautical genius , " as Linda had referred to him more than once . That must have come straight from him himself , to her . Or from some of his buddies , maybe . If he allowed Linda to meet them ? Strange 's imagination had a way of slipping little pictures of Linda in passion up into Strange 's conscious mind when Strange was n't expecting them . Linda , with her head thrown back in ecstasy . Linda in the act of coming . Linda , arching and playing with her nipples with the first two fingers of both her hands . Linda with her legs stretched wide as wide , waiting for it , receiving it . All things , of course , which she had never done with Strange . But which Strange had always imagined her doing . And now imagined again . But always of course with the " aeronautical genius . " The It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big . Broad-shouldered . Unhairy ( Strange was hairy ) . Long-waisted . Narrow-assed . Beautiful in other words . And he had a huge cock . Much bigger around , much longer , than Strange 's own . And a long mobile sensitive questing tongue . Which he usedp256beautifully , to great advantage . On Linda . Driving her out of her seclusion , out of her withdrawal , out of her mind with passion . And driving Strange out of his mind with thinking about it . If Strange was with a woman , and was drunk , and at one ofthose big parties , with lots of laughing , talking , and people , itwas not so bad , If he was alone , or at the hospital , it was bad . The other element he had gone into deeply which concernedLinda Sue was his loneliness . That did n't make much sense , even to Strange . Strange had never been lonely in his life . Never , that is , until now . Even back before they were married , when Linda was at home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see her except every year or so , Strange had not been lonely . When the war came along , after they were married , and she had been shipped back while he stayed on in Wahoo , he had not been lonely . He had never been really lonely on Guadalcanal and New Georgia . On his way back out , when the restaurant problem and his discharge had become uppermost , about half of the time he wished he was out of the marriage altogether . He certainly had not been lonely for her . Now , he was lonely with a fierceness and a misery that were unbearable . When he was at a party , drunk , and with a woman , was when he was the most lonely . But it hurt less than when he was lonely alone or at the hospital . At first , he had attributed the jealousy and the loneliness to love . Lost love . And being in love . Then in his deeper brooding , it occurred to him he had never been lonely away from Linda Sue , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waiting . And he had never been jealous of her , any more than of the Luxor girls , until he knew he 'd lost her . If these were murky glimmers of truth themselves , then his jealousy and his loneliness were n't due to lost love so much at all , as to a sense of disrupted ownership . And Strange was smart enough to know that no one had a right to own anybody . That not only was n't love . It was wrong . It was downright immoral . That was slavery . And where did that leave him ? he asked himself . It left him a lot better off thinking about Frances Highsmith , and his debt to her . That was where . He got out and paid for his unbearable taxi ride . In the fall sunshine he turned to the revolving door of the Peabody . Its suave old Negro doorman , inp257Peabody livery , with his look of thousand-year-old patience , pushed the rotating door leaf for him . In the frantic , uniform-jammed lobby , Strange looked around . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in hell in Luxor was Frances to be found ? In fact , it was no trouble at all to find Frances . She was in the suite waiting , when he got there . And she was both drunk and furious at Strange . " What the hell kind of shit was that ? " she began . " Keeping me hanging around . And then standing me up for Annie Waterfield . You kept me hanging around till it was too late to pick up any other genuine date . And then you turn me off ? Like a faucet ? Did you expect me to go out and pick up some soldier boy in the streets ? Or the downstairs bar ? Do you think I 'm some kind of hooker ? " Strange had hardly got the door shut fully . He stared at her pinched little furious face . Apparently the suite of the Navy flyers on the floor below had been closed down for the night , last night . Frances had sat up alone all night , brooding , while doing away with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trynor were in the place with her . She had burst in on Trynor and begun her tirade when he was there alone , and helpless . Luckily Landers had come along shortly after . " Well , I 'm not some fucking kind of hooker , " Frances continued . " I 'm a fucking decent girl . I work for my fucking living . And I pay my fucking own way . " Apparently the pickup and use of barrack-room language by girls was another new sign of the times , and the war , Strange realized suddenly . " What the fuck kind of show do you think we run around here ? " Frances demanded . " Do you think we 're just easy lays ? Just line us up , and bim-bam , thank-you-mam ? You embarrassed me . You made me play second place to Annie Waterfield , in front of everybody . Annie Waterfield , who thinks she 's such hot shit and number one because she 's so fucking beautiful with her tits and long blonde pageboy . You 're nothing but a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've been trying to calm her , " Landers whispered . Trynor simply sat , cracking his knuckles , and pushing his eyebrows farther up his forehead , out of his depth . " Cut off her booze , " Strange told Landers . Frances ' voice went up another five decibels.  | " I 'll help myself to anything around here that I want , " she shouted . " And none of you fucking pricks will stop me . Gim me nuther drink . " Finally they were able to get her into one of the bedrooms , where she sat on the pillows at the head of the bed , in a sort of last-ditch defensive position , her pretty legs crossed under her . Strange and Landers sat on the two bed edges by the pillows , on either side of her . Trynor had crawled onto the bed foot and sat there cracking his knuckles and working his washboard forehead . The three of them were thinking the same thing , which was that if it went on much longer and got any louder , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two huge MPs . " I think she 's becoming hysterical , " Landers whispered . " Hysterical . I 'm not hysterical . I just know my rights , " Frances shouted . Futilely Strange and Landers both flapped their hands at her to be quiet . She was undeterred . " And you . You son of a bitch , " she yelled at Strange . " I know what you 'd like to do . Would n't you ? You 'd like to hit me . Would n't you ? Well , go ahead . Why do n't you ? Go ahead . " " For God 's sake . Shut up , now , Frances , " Strange said . " Yeah , please do , " Landers whispered . She apparently did not even hear them . Strange stared at her . Here he was all prepared to go down on some woman , his very first time , everything arranged , everything all set , and she had to go and throw some idiotic scene . Strange saw it all floating away . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your type . Well , why do n't you ? What 's to stop you ? I ca n't , " Frances shouted . " Go right ahead . You 'd like to bust me right in the nose . Break my nose . Well , go ahead . Why do n't you ? " She got a deep breath . " I 'll tell you why you wo n't . Because you have n't got the guts , that 's why . You 're chicken . Chickenshit . Yahhhh . " She shut her eyes and screwed up her face and thrust it forward , sticking her tongue out as far as it would go . " Yahhhh . Yahhhh . Hit me . Go ahead . I dare you . I double-dare you . Yahhhh . " Why not , indeed ? The words formed themselves in Strange 's mind . Before they could be digested , his left hand shot out , the good one , of its own volition , in a short straight pistonlike punch . Fortunately , he was sitting twisted on the bed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nevertheless there was a loud cracking noise , followed by a sharp squawk from Frances , who then collapsed into silence , head down , her hands to her face . Strange was aghast at himself . Hitting a woman . It was the same sudden violent reaction he had had last night , when he grabbed up the water pitcher . What was happening to him ? At the same time , way down deep under his start and dismay was a tiny bright red tickle of satisfied pleasure . Goddam women . There was n't one of them who could be rational about anything . At least he had gotten even with them for once . But he was sorry . " Jesus God , " Landers whispered . He got his palm on her forehead , and began forcing her head up . Strange got her hands and pulled them down . A bright red stream of blood was runningfrom her nose , down over her hands , and now down over her chin , into her lap . " At least it shut her up for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a silly grin . Trynor was already on his way back from the bathroom with towels . " You ought n't to of done that , " he said in a mild but shocked voice . " You big oaf , " Frances said , in a muffled but nonetheless loving tone of voice . " A real dumbkopf . " " Put your head back , " Landers said . " Way back . Get some ice from the ice bucket , " he said to Trynor . " Go ahead , turn me in , " Strange said with a grin . " Just go down to the lobby . There 'll be an MP somewhere . I 'll wait right here . " " Oh , shut up , you oaf , " Frances Highsmith said . " Do you want us to try and get you a doctor ? " Landers said . " I do n't want anything , " Frances said . " Just stop the bleeding , and get me out of here . I 've got a doctor . " She was much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skirt than about her nose , apparently . The skirt made her look as if she had started menstruating . They got it off of her and Landers washed the blood out of it in cold water , and hung the dress up to dry . By the time it was dry enough the bleeding had all but stopped , but the nose was swelling steadily . " Just get me out of here , " Frances said again . They gave her a hotel napkin to cover it and Landers went down with her to the street and put her in a cab . I le offered to go with her , but she did not wantp260him to . When he came back , he threw himself down in a deep armchair with a " Whoosh ! " of relief . It was the beginning of the end for Landers and Strange . Trynor stayed on , with a key , in case any of the other oldcompanymen should come in . But Strange and Landers had had enough of partying . Both were ready to go back to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long enough to get good and drunk . Then they drank more in the cab going back . On the main outdoor walkway they parted to go to their respective wards and sleep the night through . It was just suppertime on the wards . " What 's gotten into you ? " Landers asked in the cab . " You could have gotten us all into a lot of trouble . " " I know , " Strange said . " I do n't know . I do n't know what 's happening to me . " On his own ward he slept the whole night through in an unrestful sleep , but without dreams . In the morning , though Col Curran did not appear with the morning rounds group , Strange went to him in his surgery office and turned himself over to him , with the information that he wanted the second operation . Strange calculated that in a little over four days he had spent just about two thousand dollars of the seven-thousand-dollar total . But that , of course , was only if you included @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the suite.  |p261Curran  wasted little time . Strange told him what he 'd decided . Curran smiled his small smile and said he would take Strange the next day , tomorrow . He had been meaning to get around to Strange , he said . There was not any question of Curran 's having waited for Strange to make a decision . He had n't . He just had been extraordinarily busy . Which was also the reason he had missed making morning rounds . The US 5th Army had been halted by the Germans at the Volturno in October . And had been doing heavy work , was the way Curran phrased it , since then , and in fact had been hung up not far from there since November 1st . And the tougher surgical cases were drifting back , now . He had n't had time for Strange . The mention of the 5th Army in Italy shocked Strange . He had seen two of them come onto his own ward with forearm or hand wounds . Sour , dour , silent men . Who knew nobody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew about the Salerno invasion ; of course . But what shocked him was that he had not even paid much attention . And how , though he knew about the taking of Naples , he had not bothered to read up on it at all . Hep262realized suddenly he had not looked at a newspaper in weeks . Was that how it had happened ? To the old-company men off Guadalcanal ? Who had been here when he and Winch and Landers and Prell arrived ? He left Curran 's office , already back on the familiar hospital treadmill . His day pass was canceled for that afternoon . That evening he would get a special light supper . At night at bedtime , which was at nine o'clock , they would give him a light sleeping pill . In the morning they would come at six A.M. with the pisser duck and the calmative hypo , and then wheel him to surgery . And fuck the 5th Army in Italy . That was how he felt . Was that how the others had felt ? In the surgery , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put their masks on , he asked Curran groggily , grinning a silly grin , if they would please give him some other kind of anesthetic . Curran shook his head . Sodium pentothol was the best they had . " Why another ? " " Gives me bad dreams , " Strange said woozily . Curran grinned . " A few bad dreams never hurt anybody . " He went on putting up his gauze mask , becoming some kind of an alien with its tie-strap over his cap . Then he turned to his male assistant for his sterile gloves , popping his hands into the rubber . The dream when it came , the vision , the hallucination , was all very familiar . It was as though it were taking up right where the other had left off . A certain time period seemed to have passed . And Strange , in his mind , was aware of all that had happened , while he had been away . There were the same flashing lights , and the same distant shouting . As of crowds . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other time . First , the anesthetist was talking him up onto it , softly , gently , exhorting , like a trainer talking up a fighter before going down to the ring . Then he was dripping the stuff into the vein , and Strange was counting backwardfrom ten , till the explosion of noxious fumes came in the roof of his mouth . Then with no time lapse at all he was in the great hall . Waking up . Aware he was waking up . Struggling hard to wake up . But committed to the vision , to its complete unrolling , before he would be allowed out of limbo and back to Strange . It was not the same public hall as before . This hall was somep263sort of private official chamber , where the public was not allowed . But the public could be heard shouting , outside the building . It all seemed very Romanesque , to Strange . The robes , the columns , the windowless window openings , the huge drapes , the statuary . Roman , or maybe Greek . Here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as before . He sat on a long raised dais against one wall , behind a long wooden table , which had many official-looking objects and documents lying on it . Once again the judge was shrouded , in a long white robe , that covered his head and hid his face , so that nothing of him showed except his huge , powerful , white hands . But this judge was not , Strange knew , the same judge of before . An appeal had been made , Strange knew . And this judge , in the privacy of the official chamber , was a much greater authoritythan before . Strange watched the shrouded arm and huge white hand come up as before , pointing . Then in a great powerful voice , a huge basso held down to gentleness , to mildness , so as not to shatter all the listening eardrums and shred the heavy fabric of the great drapes , the faceless figure said , " No , my son . You may not stay . " Desolate , Strange turned to walk out of the great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shoutings of the crowds grew louder . Then he was back in the hands of the anesthetist and his assistant , both of whose shoutings suddenly grew softer , as Strange opened his eyes . Curran was stripping off his mask and his gloves . Under the gauze , he was grinning . There was a feeling of great elation all over the surgery . The anesthetist was grinning . All the assistantswere grinning . Curran himself was in the grip of such an expansiveness he seemed hardly able to contain it . " I think we 've done you a pretty good job of work , " he said downward . " Sure have , " the anesthetist grinned . Strange , who was looking at Curran , managed to lower oneeyelid in a slow wink . Then he shut his eyes . As before , he wasstill so full of the dream that the actual people did not seem real . What in the hell did it all mean ? Where was it he could notstay ? What was it he must go back to ? It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a movie sequel . Where did it all come from ? Was it all just lying there waiting for him , every time he had sodium pentothol ? What if he never had another operation ? Would it just stay there ? He would never know the end of the story . And what would happen to it then ? He could remember the faces of people he saw in the second hall , whom he had seen in the first hall . It was so real . More real than the operation . Under him , he could feel them moving him onto the rolling table . His hand was a huge bundled-up package of gauze . He lay still , his eyes still shut , and let them roll him . By the time they moved him from the rolling table onto his own bed in the ward 's private room , he was ready to go sound asleep . He woke only for a moment . The operation was a huge success , apparently . Or so the surgicalteam seemed to think . Well , he would wait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , till later . It was his last thought before heavy sleep . The first time he woke it was evening , just at supper time . By then the real pain had begun . They doped him up for it and he went back to sleep , without eating . The second time he woke was in the middle of the night , around three in the morning , and he was hungry . Ravenous . In spite of the pain . The night man was prepared for that , fed him , and gave him more dope for the pain . By the middle of the next morning they were ready to get him out of bed and on his feet . And to hell with his pain . All told , they kept him laid up with it without any passes for a week . The bad pain receded after four days . But on the second day they let him have visitors . The first visitor was Landers . The first question Strange asked was about Frances . Then , secondly , he asked about Winch . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Strange wondered woozily if his putting Winch after Frances meant he was losing interest in the old-company men , in the same way he was losing interest in the battles and the war . If so , that was terrible . Landers had news of Winch . Winch 's orders to leave for Camp O'Bruyerre had come in on the same morning Strange was operated on . By some weird , strange stretch of fate , as Landers put it . Winch had left that afternoon , unable to say good-by to Strange , who was still knocked out and sleeping . That part had been okay . Unavoidable . But Landers felt Winch had acted odd . The 1st/sgt , now warrant officer juniorp265grade , had packed his small bit of gear and then come around to make his expected good-bys to the other old-company men . But instead of going to see each man , he had designated Landers and Corello to collect them , and then met them all together sort of formally , in the snack bar . That meant that Landers had to go see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Winch had not given much of a performance in the snack bar . Afterward , he had called Landers off and said good-by to him alone . That was n't much of a performance , either . But he had sent good-bys to Strange , and said to tell him he would be in touch as soon as he got settled . Strange should not hold his breath , though , he said with a snarly grin , because getting settledmight take him some time . " He seemed so distant , " Landers said . " He did n't seem like he cared much of a shit , one way or the other . " " You do n't understand him , " Strange said woozily , from where he lay propped up on bed pillows in the tiny room . " It hurt him too much , to say good-by . It hurt him so much he sluffed it off . " " Maybe , " Landers said , obviously not agreeing . " He 's at his best when somebody needs him , " Strange insisted . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But now nobody needs him , and there 's nothing to do . " " He did n't send any good-bys to Prell . " " Naturally , " Strange grinned . Landers obviously disagreed but he let it drop . And went on to Frances . In his woozy head , Strange noted that Landers had given the news of Winch first , although the first question had been about Frances . He knows what 's important , Strange thought to himself , even if I do n't . The news Landers had to give about Frances was that there had been no news of Frances at all . She had disappeared from both Strange 's suite and the suite of the Navy flyers . In the two days there had been no sign of her anywhere . She had not been in the bar downstairs , or anywhere visible in the Claridge . At least not to the knowledge of anyone of either group who knew her . On the other hand , there had been no police coming around , or MPs . That was all the news @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart sink in him , but did not let Landersp266realize this . Well , maybe she was just resting up , he rejoined . Letting the swelling go down . After all , it was the weekend now . She would have until Monday before she had to go back to work . The swelling might be almost normal by then , might n't it ? Landers raised an eyebrow wryly , and did n't answer . " Well , might n't it ? " Strange said . Landers did not answer . Landers had not mentioned the nosebreakingto anybody , and had cautioned Trynor not to either . In the two days since Strange 's absence Landers had by a kind of consensus become the administrative head of Peabody Suite 804 . Or Strange 's Suite , as it had come to be called by all of them . Fortunately Landers ' own money had come in , and he was able to lay out what sums were necessary . " No , no . No , no , " Strange said with great upset , rearing up in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I mean , you ca n't do that . This is my thing . " " Shit on it , " Landers smiled . " Fuck it . " He passed across a sour , hard , unreadable look . " I guess if I want to get rid of my money too , I can . " Landers had been forced to forbid the other old-company men from inviting just any soldier up to the suite . They none of them seemed to have any real judgment of people , and they wanted to show off . He had been forced to lay down the law after last night that any stranger who was invited up to the parties must first be screened by Landers himself . " Last night we had a couple of meanies , mean drunks , " he said . He had had to punch them and throw them out bodily . Strange looked at him tiredly from the pillows . " You 've becomea leader , " he said . Landers gave him the bitter look again . " Yeah . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nt it ? Right after I 've chucked the whole thing . Now the Army 'll never be able to use it . " " Maybe they will , " Strange said . " No . The Army does n't want my kind of leadership . The Army does n't want imagination . They do n't even like a limited imagination . " " Do n't be too sure of that . " " I 'm pretty sure , " Landers said equably . To Strange 's woozy head it seemed pretty clear Landers had made some decision about something , had moved from one plateauof thinking to some other.  | " What do you mean , chucked it ? " Strange said . " I 've chucked it , " Landers said . " Given up on it . From now on I 'm only going to do exactly what I 'm told to do . No more and no less . And as little of that as I can get by with safely . " " Then you 're officer material , " Strange grinned . " You should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Landers said briskly . " I 'm not going to tell some poor son of a bitch under me to go get killed . " Strange only laughed . But the whole thing set him to thinking , and to fretting , about Landers . And about the change in Landers . Whatever it was , and Landers did not say what , it had changed Landers in some very basic way . He had a lot more authority . And a lot less dedication and commitment , to go with it . In town , he went on spending his own money , over Strange 's protests . And he also went on administering the minor problems of Strange 's Suite 804 . He also became Strange 's eyes and ears in town , for the week that Strange was laid up . Everything that happened in the suite , or around the suite in the hotel , or around the hotel in the town , was reported to Strange by Landers . Landers reported in such detail that it was about as good as Strange being there himself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a lot of points in its favor . The reportorial sessions took place usually just before Landers went off to town , right after lunch . Lunch was what they both called it now . After so much going to town on day passes , Landers had dropped the Army meal designations of dinner and supper , and had gone back to lunch and dinner . Strange had followed his example , almost unconsciously . But sometimes Strange wondered what Linda Sue called her midday meal , now . Had she stayed with the old , family and country names of dinner and supper ? Or had she gone on to lunch and dinner , like her " aeronautical genius " from Long Island must call them ? Linda had not telephoned Strange since he left Cincinnati with the money . And certainly Strange had not called her . Strange wondered sometimes if she was perhaps waiting for him to call , first ? If she was , that was tough shit . He was n't that interested . He was much more interested in Frances Highsmith . But repeatedly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about Frances was that she had disappeared . Nobody had seen her in any of the places where the men of the two suites hungp268out . Neither in the low-down bars , nor the high-class . She had not shown up at any Navy suite parties . He and Strange discussedthis , but could come up with no answer of what to do . Another of the things they discussed at great length was the frequency with which Landers was getting into fights . Since the day of the breaking of Frances ' nose , Landers had averaged a fight a day with somebody . It seemed to Strange , as Landers said it had to him , that the first fight with the two Navy chiefs and their bunch in the Peabody bar presaged a period of fighting for them both . Landers felt that Strange 's hitting Frances and breaking her nose was part of the same syndrome . Landers said he had felt it , though he had n't done it , as far back as his furlough home when he had become enraged at the Air Force @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Though he had no answer as to why , any more than Landers had . Strange pointed out one thing , which was that they were both in better physical shape now , more nearly healed , and so were able to fight . At least he himself had been , until his new operation . Landers nodded at this , and accepted it . Landers pointed out.that also they were both much closer to going back to duty and combat , probably in Europe , with their accurate foreknowledge of what that implied . Maybe that affected them . Landers said that he himself did not like to fight and did not want to , but that he was constantly becoming enraged . Landers had never been much of a fistfighter or brawler , and had not wanted to be , though he had learned a little boxing . But he used to go out of his way to avoid a fight , walk around it . Now , the slightest thing , and Landers was not only ready to fight . A fight was just about guaranteed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of respect for himself , or for any of his overseas buddies , or for his old outfit , or for his branch of service even . And Landers did n't even care that much , about the Army . Nevertheless , a kind of intense , awful rage that tinged everything in sight with red would leap out from some unknown place in Landers and demand retribution . Landers did not know where it came from , or what was causing it . One day , for example , Landers had gone alone across the street to the little hashhouse restaurant opposite the Peabody . The suite upstairs had been empty and Landers had wanted something to eat in the presence of other people , without botheringwith the goddamned room service . A quick little quietp269bite . Standing in the line to go through the cafeteria counter , he had had three soldiers come in behind him . The leader of the three was a small , muscular man with a cocky , cruel face . Landers had disliked him immediately and turned away . But the small man marched right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoulder , twice . " Looks like a GI messhall , do n't it , Mack ? " he demanded in a truculent voice . " Do n't put your hands on me , Mack , " Landers said . His voice had hardened instantly , and down deep inside him he felt the red tickle begin to grow . He swung half around . He had n't yet picked up a plate . " Do n't call me Mack , Mack , " the small man snarled , and leaned his head forward with a sort of eager , mean , fighting smile . " I do n't let people call me Mack . " Landers had n't answered . There did n't seem to be any point . He completed his swing around , bringing his right hand around in a sort of tight , rising right hook that hit the man perfectly on his thrust-out jaw . The man went down . Landers immediately went on top of him , the peculiar red tide rising in his ears with the noise of an ocean breaker , and tingeing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six or eight times in the face and sides of the head before one of the man 's buddies and some stranger soldier pulled him off . The little man was hardly conscious . His face was bleeding , his nose was broken , three of his teeth were out , and one ear was torn loose where a punch had grazed it . Around them the civilian customers had scrambled out of the way , looking horrified and talking about soldiers . Landers stuffed in his khaki shirttail and blew out his cheeks . But the red rage in him had not receded . It wanted more . " You want some of it ? " he said to the other two . But fortunately neither of them was as truculent as their leader . They backed away holding up their friend , one of them carefully picking up his three teeth , and left . Landers did not know why he had done it . Telling it to Strange , he said it seemed stupid to give the other guy the first shot . Then thinking deeply , Landers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , petty guy . Used to bullying people . But Landers was sorry about the teeth . Another time , at the Plantation Roof on top the hotel Landers had , personally and all alone , beaten up three warrant officerp270pilots from the Army Ferry Command . It was the same stupid kind of a story . Landers had gone up there alone , mainly to get away from the crowd and noise in the suite . He had n't taken a woman , but had taken a bottle . In the customary brown sack . The huge place was crowded but by now Landers knew the headwaiter , who knew Landers tipped well and gave him an empty four table with a " reserved " on it . It was about then Landers noticed the three young warrant officer pilots , sitting at a table nearby and watching him . Perhaps because he had an expensive table all to himself . The table was a good one down near the dance floor and Landers sat at it alone watching the dancers and getting steadily more drunk , and feeling lost , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ irascible self-pity , as he later said to Strange . There was one of those huge revolving mirror balls , with tiny mirrors that flashed spectrum lights in his eyes . It was no time to have a woman with you , and Landers was glad he had not brought one . But he enjoyed watching the dancing couples , as they moved through the colored lights spraying the floor . It was near to closing , and the band as was customary was playing a set of sentimental numbers . Songs like " As Time Goes By , " and like " Red Sails in the Sunset , " and " Harbor Lights , " and like " We 'll Meet Again . " Landers found them all so in keeping with his mood that it was unbelievable . At that moment there was n't anything in the world Landers hated , or detested . Everybody suffered . That was one thing you could count on . Stray , wispy shreds of thought ran through his head before he could catch their tails . About honor , and death , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death , tragedy that was embraced , love that was hopefully lost . Everybody died ; some younger , a part of his mind said , as Landers later told Strange , and someday all of us would look back on these lovely sweet darling times and rememberall these songs . Yeah . Yeah , the other part of Landers ' mind said , as he explained to Strange , those of us who survived would . But at least he was n't mad at anybody . At closing , which was one o'clock , they played " The StarSpangledBanner , " as they always did . Landers did not get up . It was almost force of habit by now , since so many of the wounded out at the hospital did the same thing . The general , if perhaps irreverent , joke out at the hospital was that thep271wounded did not need to stand for the national anthem . There had been talk of fights over it , but Landers had not seen any . But Landers had always been with a group when he did it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beginning to clear out , the biggest and apparently highest ranking of the three w/os appeared at his table . " I think you had better learn to stand up for the national anthem , soldier , " he said . Landers glanced up at him , and then down . The red tickle was beginning to burn in him . " Fuck off , bud , " he said . " Okay . I want your name , rank , and organization , " the w/o said , " and that 's an order , soldier . " He pulled out a pencil and notebook . Inside , Landers was beginning to chortle . Down deep underneath , the red ocean breaker was swelling and growing in his ears . This time , he looked up and did n't drop his gaze . " How would you like my fist in your face , instead ? " Without a word , the young pilot put away his notebook , turned on his heel , went back to his table , and sat down . He began to argue with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apparently was n't . Landers sat and grinned at them . By this time their two tables were the only two still with occupants . At the entry , the two elevators were swiftly siphoningoff the crowd . Behind Landers , the civilian headwaiter was hovering nervously . " Who are them bums ? " he asked . He had a New Yorkese accent . " Out-of-towners , " Landers said , " flying through . College boys from the Ferry Command . Do n't worry . " He paid his bill and left the headwaiter his big tip with a wink . He got almost as far as the elevators , before he was hailed by the same w/o . " Hey , soldier . I want that organization of yours . And your name . " The three of them were coming toward Landers , all in a resolute row . The biggest one had won the debate apparently . Landers pushed the elevator button , and then stood , quietly watching them . His mind was totally blank , totally empty . When they were almost at punching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Some belated instinct told him to go for the reluctant one first . From that point on , things happened very fast , though they seemed to he in slow motion . They were n't expecting a rush and scattered , away from him . A mistake . 1 le hit the reluctant one ,  |p272who  went down , and stayed down . As Landers 'd hoped . He swung around , and the big one was rushing him . Landers stepped to meet him , and hit him with everything he had , a left that knocked him sideways back against the elevator doors . But just as the w/o touched them , his arms flung wide to catch himself , the elevator Landers had summoned arrived , and the doors opened . The w/o stumbled back across the elevator interior , his feet working fast , a look of surprise on his face , and hit the back wall of the elevator with a crash , and started to go down . Landers was almost as surprised as he was . He stepped after him , hoisted him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and saw his eyes glaze . He turned , pushed the ground-floor button , and stepped back out before the doors closed . The third one was rushing him , but looking reluctant now that he was alone . Landers hit him once , twice , three times , four , driving him back across the entry and following him , until he went down , lolling against some antique loveseat . Landers ' drive was so hard it carried Landers clear on past him . The red roar was in his ears , and inside him the huge , red ocean breaker was topping over . He could hear his own voice shouting something or other . Then he saw the elevator arrow was rising again and went past the third one who was struggling to get up , kicking him carefully in the side of the head as he passed , and met the elevatoras the doors opened . He hit the biggest w/o as he came out , followed , and hit him twice more , then pushed the ground-floor button again , and stepped out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down . Landers pushed the second elevator button , stepped into the empty elevator when it arrived , got off at the eighth floor , and went back to the suite . He was limping from where he had hurt his bad ankle again , one side of his jaw was sore , and the knuckles of both hands were barked . But the MPs would never find him . He did not tell anybody in the suite what had happened , he said to Strange . And he was sorry that it was over . Strange had been moved from the semiprivate room back out to the open ward , by this time . Landers told him this particular tale on the fifth day after the operation . Strange sat on his bunk , flexing his weak fingers inside their new plaster cast , and watched Landers ' calm , matter-of-fact face , wondering whatp273was going on in Landers ' head while he told his fight tales so matter-of-factly . Strange was having trouble knowing what was going on in his own head . Certainly , one part of him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . Another part of him devoutly was glad he had not had the chance . Strange did not know what was happening to himself , either . Any more than he knew what was happening to Landers . Strange only knew he no longer had his old self-control . That frightened him a little . He was unable to judge , for either of them . And that made him a little scared . Landers did not know it , but Strange had had another version of the fight with the three pilots . Two of the old-company men had slipped away from the suite and gone upstairs to look for Landers , to make sure he was all right . Everybody was a little worried about him , so with the benediction of everyone Corello and Trynor had gone after him . They happened to be standing against the back wall with the headwaiter when it started . Landershad not seen them . It was Trynor who told Strange since , naturally , Corello never told anybody about anything , if he could help it . " I never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a kind of unwilling , irate protest . " I do n't think nobody could of stopped him . Five men , seven men could n't of whipped him . It was like some unbeatable power or force in him . When he went at them , them three fellows did n't know what hit them . It was like they had grabbed a damn tiger by his tail . " Trynor cleared his throat . " Do you think maybe he 's losing his mind , Sarge ? " Strange did not answer . He did not trust himself to . He had felt the same power or force in himself . Trynor held up his hand . " I 'm not sayin ' he was n't right . He was . But it was the way he went about it . I know all of us got some of that feeling in us , " he said , in his lumbering way . " But not like that . " Suddenly Trynor laughed , reluctantly . " My God , them fellows scattered like a covey of birds . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said to Trynor . " Anyway , as long as he was right , " he wound up , inconclusively . And sitting with Landers , Strange felt just as inconclusive . Strange did not know if he was equal to bringing it up , and going into it . In depth . Smart , Landers was . He knew Landersp274was smart . But he did not know if Landers had his , Strange 's , powers of analysis . " Anyway , Marion , " Strange said , " I 'll be out of here in a couple of days now . We 'll go in together . You 've done a wonderfuljob of taking care of things . " It was the first time Strange had ever called him by his first name . Landers grinned at him . " We 'll have to find old Frances Highsmith . " He shrugged . " I do n't have any idea where she could be . But for the two days I 'll keep looking . " " Yes , " Strange said . " Well , I guess that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " As long as she 's all right . " Of course , he was lying . It did matter . Strange did not know if Landers knew he was lying . But he did not want Landers to know , or want to admit to Landers , that Frances Highsmith and the idea of going down on her had become an obsessive preoccupation with him . To an unreasonable degree . In the end it was Strange himself who found her , finally . Landers had not turned up any signs of her . The day Strange went back into town , the two of them together hunted but did not turn her up either . Frances Highsmith had disappeared off the face of the earth as far as the Peabody and Claridge hotels were concerned . For four more days Strange hunted for her , half-heartedly , by himself . The most of his hunting was confined to the night hours . During the day he assumed she was working . Somewhere . Wherever it was she worked . It was on the fifth day , the night of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left the suite and its nonstop party , then after a quick look in the bar had left the hotel , and walked the two blocks up Union to Main St. He was looking for her , and he was not looking for her . He had about given up . He no longer expected to find her . But the suite bored him . Landers had given him a quick wink as he left . At the corner of Main , he turned vaguely by the big Walgreen'sto walk the five blocks to the Claridge . But not because of Frances . There was a melancholy hunger in him that was palpable , in the night air . There was nothing of love in the melancholy . No love of a lost Linda Sue , no love for a misplaced Frances Highsmith . The hunger was so general , so diffuse , so a love for all females , all women , that it was essentially without object . It was a hunger for unknown , forbidden , sexual adventure . The fall air was chill against his summer uniform . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Strange felt exactly as he used to feel as a boy when he got all dolled up and went into Houston to hit the whorehouses . The shop windows on the other side , the Claridge 's side , were loaded with stuff for women . Hundreds , thousands , tens of thousands of dollars worth of stuff . For pretty women , pretty girls . Who the hell could afford to buy it all ? Businessmen . Only the businessmen , who had stayed home , and were making fortunes off the good old war . Strange walked on along , looking in the women 's shops ' windows . He had not been without women the past four nights . Each night he had had at least one , out of the Peabody covey . But it had n't worked . He had performed well enough , but there was no excitement . The irony was that now there was the excitement , but no girl . One of the first things he had found out from them was that not all the girls were sexually as free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't go down on you and they did n't expect you , did n't want you , to go down on them . Strange would even have gone for Annie Waterfield this time , but Annie had gone off with some new officer from the Navy flyers ' suite . For an unspecified period . Annie had become somebody else 's girl for the moment . For this week . Strange ambled on along . So here he was , Frances-less , and Annie-less . His head had just finished the thought about Annie when his eye caught a figure . It had detached itself from among the figures on the opposite sidewalk and moved out into the street to cross it diagonally , going away from him . His eye recognized it as Frances before he himself did . Automatically , he filled his lungs and bellowed . " Hey ! Frances ! " The excitement in him swelled . Strange could n't believe his luck . Inside his belly , something got all slippery and greasy and seemed to slide around with grease on it . A thickness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice . The figure had stopped and was looking at him . It was Frances . But how he had recognized her he did n't know . She was dressed presentably enough , in a light dress with a light fall coat . But there was something furtive and scuttling , something crablike , about the way she moved and stood . No longer was there the free-swinging stride and breast-jutting posture . She was hunched down inside her coat as if trying to hide.  |p276Strange  's heart gave a huge , twinging lurch . He hoped there was nothing wrong with her face , to have caused the change in her . He gulped air . Jesus , that would be terrible . His eyes moved away sideways to go over the facade of the low-life bar she apparently had just come out of . It was one they had not even bothered to look in for her . " Oh , it 's you , " she said in a low voice when he got close to her . She seemed to straighten up a little . " How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face structurally , he saw . And a great , silent whoosh of relief sprouted in him . The broken nose had healed perfectly , not twisted , no flattened bridge , no ugly lump . Only in the very deepest bottoms of her eyes , when he was close , was there any indication of change in her . Down there , way down , something slippery seemed to move and change shape , and refuse to let him come close to it or put a finger on it . " The important thing is how are you ? " Strange said . He was smiling hard . " I 'm fine , " she said . But there was no give in her , no letting down . " I 've worried like hell about you , " Strange said , in his noticeablychoked-up voice . " You have ? " A sudden strange , wise , greedy grin cracked her face from side to side . " Well , I 'm fine . I 'm in great shape . I do n't think I could be better . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When he thought of why , his throat got choked up more . It sounded in his voice . And the grin on her face seemed to get wider and greedier . She stared straight at him , and the slippery thing in her eyes moved . She did n't answer . " Why did n't you ever come back to the hotel ? To the suite ? " Strange asked . The grin did not go away , but her words were hard and cold as iron . " I do n't ever want to go back to that place again . " " Oh , come on , " Strange said . " Why not ? " Her eyes looked away from him , then her face turned away . She was no longer smiling . " Everybody knows everything about what happened . " " No , they do n't . Landers and I have n't told anybody . And we swore Trynor to secrecy . He has n't told anybody . None of us have . "  | " Well , they know about your having chosen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , into that crablike position , half turned away . Ready to scuttle . " Oh , come on , now , " Strange said , uneasily . " You girls have never been that way about anybody else . You 've never cared who had who first . " " I do n't ever want to go back there , " Frances said , anyway . " Fine . Then do n't . " Too angry . Strange could see himself blowing the whole thing sky high . Nothing was coming out right , and he did n't know what to say to make the proper effect . He tried again . " I do n't like it much any more myself . That 's why I 'm out here . That 's why I left it . " She did not respond . " Come on over to the Claridge with me and have a drink and let 's talk about it , " he said . She did not answer . Neither yes nor no . Flattery , damn it . Always remember flattery , Strange belaboredhimself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else will . Simple flattery . Even when they know it . " That 's a lovely outfit you 've got on , " Strange said . " Listen . I 've been going nuts , looking for you . I 've been looking for you for a whole week . Come on . Have a drink ? " She did not answer that . " What were you doing the other week ? " she said . Strange suddenly felt dumb , and empty . " What other week ? " " The first week , " she said . Strange felt reprieved . He held up his cast . " I was getting my hand operated . The day after the  --  The day after I last saw you , they pulled me in and did my hand again . I 've been in the hospital . I was laid up for a week . They would n't let me out . " But I had Landers looking for you . " " He never found me , " Frances said . Somehow , without having answered him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offer of a drink , she now had him by the arm , and they were moving . Toward the Claridge . It was the right direction . " You 're the most attractive girl I 've seen , " Strange said , in a husky whisper . " You 're the most attractive girl I 've met since I 've been here . " " You want to go down on me , " Frances said.  |p278There  was an audible pause . " Yes , " Strange whispered in a choked-up voice . It seemed to him the answer had been torn out of him . " All right , " Frances said briskly . Against him Strange felt her pace quicken in a brusque , purposefulway . That oddly wise , greedy smile was back on her face . Everything seemed to have gone into a pink haze of unsubstantialityin front of his eyes , as if his blood pressure suddenly had risen alarmingly , and motion took on a slowed , languid quality that made everything dreamlike and unreal . They hurriedslowly toward the Claridge . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smile , holding on to the arm tightly . " I knew you 'd want to , eventu-ally . " The sense of dreamy unreality stayed with Strange through all the preliminaries . Luckily , there were rooms available at the Claridge . He did not have to call Jack Alexander upstairs at the poker game . Luckily , the liquor store had not quite closed . He was able to get them a bottle . In the room , Frances did not even wait to get her stomach a drink , before she began taking off her clothes . She did not have a bad little figure . Strange made drinks of bourbon and ice and a little water , and noted as he did that she was not wearing either a brassiere or panties . Well , she did n't need a bra . And maybe she did n't need the pants . Vague thoughts of the low-down bar he was sure she had just come out of tipped dreamily through his mind , and whether she had been with somebody already tonight . He thought briefly about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Nothing mattered . He did n't give a damn . He could feel his heart beating slower , and slower , and slower in his ears . He handed her the drink and , nude , she drank it off in one long pull and put the empty glass down and sat down in an armchair . She pulled her legs up , opening herself , and put her heels on the chair edge against her buttocks , experimentally , and then put her legs down and crossed them . Strange was almost frantically getting out of his own clothes . The tie , the shirt , the T-shirt , the shoes , the pants , the underpants , the sox . It seemed an endless process . It occurred to Strange , as he toiled , that nude photos and paintings of women did not matter and did not really exposep279women , and that secretly women knew this . A woman was not really exposed until she opened herself , as Annie  --  as Frances , had just done . But men did not know this about women and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ From her chair Frances held up a warning finger . " I just want to get one thing straight , before we start , " she said with the authority of a 1st/sgt . " Did you go down on Annie ? " " No , " Strange said . " No , I did n't . " " You did n't ? Scout 's honor ? " She nodded emphatically . " Becauseshe 's the only one besides me up there who does it , who likes it . " " No , " Strange said . " But how did you know that she  --  " " From the men , of course . You dumbhead , " Frances said scornfully . " Do you talk to each other about  --  " " No . We only talk to each other about the men . But we know everything about everybody . " She pulled her nude legs up and set her heels against her buttocks , in the position she had tested before . " Now , listen . You can go down on me . But I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not going to let you fuck me afterwards . After I come . " She paused to look at him , and closed the admonishing finger into her hand . " I may let you jerk yourself off . But I may not let you come at all . I have n't decided yet . " " All right , " Strange said . She stared at him . " I may make you sleep all night right there beside me , and not let you come , " she said , and watched him . Strange did n't answer . " Or I may let you jack off with your nose in me . " She stared at him more . " I want you to understand it all beforehand , " she said , " before we start . I 'm not as big and strong as you . But if you hit me or start to beat me up , I 'll scream for cops so loud they 'll hear me in St. Louis . " " All right , " Strange said again . Still staring , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she let the strange grin crack open her face again , as though it had been split with a razor . And the slippery little wormy things in the bottoms of her eyes seemed to move around . " You 've got it coming to you , " Frances said . " You owe it to me . " Strange guessed she was right . Anyway , he had never been sop280hot for anything in his life . He would have agreed to anything . He could not remember ever having had such a full , hard , throbbingerection ever . She had one hand down there touching herself , pulling it open . " All right , " Frances said . " Come on over here . Come on . Yes , come on . Yes . Yes . Yes , that 's it . Yes . Yes , " she said as she twined her fingers into his hair . " Oh , the little piggie . Oh , the little piglet . Oh , the greedy , hungry , snorty , little piggie . " Strange felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's it , yes . Yes , that 's it . Oh , he loves it . Oh , he does love it . He wants it . He wants it . They all want it . " Her voice went on , talking things to him , or to herself . But Strange was n't listening . It was not true that it did not taste . There was a faint taste of urine , which was not at all unpleasant , and a faint odor of it , but this disappeared almost at once , presumably because he himself had licked it off and swallowed it , and then it was true that it had no taste . The faint odor of urine combined with an even fainter smell of perfume , and perhaps of sweat , and mingled with the odor of what for lack of a better word Strange could only call " Woman , " which got stronger , and then stronger . But the really delicious thing about it was the textural quality . It had all the benefits of deep kissing , but was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything with his mouth that felt so delicious . The smaller , delicately formed inner lips seemed to cling to his face . The texture of the roll that covered the little organ felt like an inner lip of the mouth but was more sensory , and moved from side to side under his tongue . The hairs along the heavier outer lips tickled the sides of his nose . " Do it up at the top more , " Frances said in an unsteady voice . " Do it up at the top more . Do it up at the top **25;4883;TOOLONG ! " She seemed to go on talking in disconnected syllables that did not seem to say anything , for quite a long time . Strange did not know what she was saying , and did not care . When her body stopped quivering , he rolled away and sat on the floor , breathing as harshly as she was . His cock felt like some  --  kind of monstrous club . It was so charged with blood he felt it might just blow up like a grenade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the room with red drops . It wanted something around it , a hand , a mouth , a rubber glove , a pussy . Anything . And yet he was all prepared , all psyched , to abide by whatever decision she made , even if it meant going top281bed beside her with this swollen red , flamboyant thing untouched . Strange had discovered he was a pervert , that was the truth . There was n't any other way to look at it . As if responding to him , Frances , who had put her legs down and crossed them in a sort of self-hugging , pussy-hugging way , opened her eyes , staring at nothing . " There are so many things we can do , " she said dreamily to the ceiling . " Hundreds of things . " Abruptly she brought her eyes down , to Strange , looking at him in a way as if she had never seen him before . " Oh ! " she said . " You ! I do n't care about all that other stuff . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Quickly she got to her feet from the chair , and headed across the room to where the bed was . Strange almost beat her to the bed . Although he felt a faint disappointment in him . " God , " she said . " I never had it like that before . Most men , you know , most men do n't really like it . They want to do it but they hate it . They 're rough , and mean , and brutal . When they do it . " Oh , there 's so much we can do , " she said . " Strange . Johnny . Johnny Stranger . " When he had come , and after she had quieted and gone sound to sleep , which was n't long , Strange rolled over on his back and tried to think it through . In the first place , it was such a flattering , ego-pumping thing to have somebody say your name so lovingly . So he had to discount , because of that . In the second place , he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had ever heard about . And he was sure Frances Highsmith was n't either . On the other hand , they had it pretty damned good together in the bed . That was n't to be sneezed at . Anyway , it was n't going to last that long . Not if his educated guess about the new hand operation was correct . He would be going back to duty . But in the third place , there was the new undigested knowledge . He was a pervert . A sexual pervert . From some deep well in him where he had never been , this thing had risen up and taken him over . In one fell swoop , he had become an addict of eating pussy . Just like it was some damned drug or something . Jesus , in most places it was even against the laws . Specificallyp282against the laws . Like fucking animals . Or homosexuality . And he did n't even care . Laws simply could not stop him . Addict or not , unlawful or not , he would never want to be without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For the first time in what seemed a very long time , lying in the cool bed , between clean , smooth sheets , with the hump of Frances Highsmith 's sleeping ass under them beside him , Strange thought about the old company 's mud-hungry platoons , still out there , still fogging it , still sweating , still dying . Nobody , until he had been out there with them , could appreciatesheets . And clear , clean water flowing out of a tap , on demand . Or the smell of a woman that was n't really his , sleeping next to him . Strange wondered what they would say , if they ever found out that their old mess/sgt , Mother Strange , was a cunt-eating pervert . Strange felt very undeserving . He was afflicted with a terrible guilt . But the guilt was n't sexual . It was military . Or , maybe it was both . He could no longer tell . Finally , having decided nothing , he rolled over on his side and went to sleep , replete . More replete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been in all his life . To think that all those years , he had .. . The next morning just at dawn ( he had left a call downstairs in the lobby ) Strange hoisted himself , and joggled Frances awake just enough to say good-by , and took off for the hospital and the regular reveille . It was still the prime guiding principle in his life . At morning rounds , when Curran told him they would take the cast off in a day or two and see how successful they had been , Strange wondered if the surgeon , looking at him , could tell he was a pervert.  |p285Mart  Winch had been at Camp O'Bruyerre three weeks when he first heard Marion Landers had been fighting people and was in trouble because of it . By that time winter finally had set in , it was the first week in December , and Luxor had had its first cold and its first light snow . The word on Landers came to Winch via a telephone call from big Jack Alexander at the hospital . Landers had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1st/It , had beaten him up in the post recreation hall , had then proceeded to have a violent altercationwith Maj Hogan , the administrative chief , in which he had threatened and verbally insulted the major , and then had gone AWOL for five days . Landers was now under ward arrest , Alexander said . Maj Hogan was preferring charges , on all four counts . The 1st/it had declined to prefer charges . But Hogan 's charges would be enough to get Landers a special court-martial and a three to six months sentence . If Landers had not come back on his own , and instead had been picked up by the MPs and been brought back , he might easily have drawn a general court.  | " Well , what the fuck am I supposed to do about that ? " Winch said , in a kind of exasperated bawl . For a second he let his eye go to his office windows outside which so much was going on at the moment . " I du n no . Nothing , " Alexander said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thickened voice came over the phone in exactly the same way his blue eyes fixed you . Winch had a sudden wild vision of his hard-edged turtle 's mouth , eating its way up the phone mouthpiece crunch by slow , ruminative crunch . " He 's one of your original bunch of boys , ai nt he ? I thought you 'd want to know . " " Wait a minute , " Winch said . " Do n't hang up . What is there I can do about it ? What does your Col Stevens say ? " " Col Stevens , " Jack Alexander said , very slowly and very precisely , " ai nt said anything about it . " He did not say " his " Col Stevens , this time , Winch noted . " I do n't know he even knows about it . " " He must know about it , " Winch said . " If Hogan 's preferred charges . " " I suppose he must know about it . Yeah , " Alexander 's voice said . " But he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do you think it would be worthwhile to talk to him ? " " I do n't have an idea . " " Well would it be bad , if I talked to him ? " " I do n't see how it could do Landers any harm . But I do n't know . " " Now what the fuck is that supposed to mean ? " Winch cried . He was getting frustrated . Here was supposed to be one of the most important men the US Army in the middle area of the United States was supposed to have . A man who could get done just about anything he wanted done , the word said . A man who was supposed to be making deals and money right and left and backward . And Winch was soliciting him . Begging him , and asking him not to hang up . And he  --  after making the call in the first place  --  was playing footsie and being coy . " Do you think I can be of any help to him , or do n't you ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any help to him , or not be any help to him , " the hard , scarred , old sea turtle 's voice said . " I only called you . You know as well as I do , just how uptight things have been getting in all the services lately . All around the Horn . And you know why.  | " Do n't you ? " the voice said sharply . A little thrill ran up Winch 's back . But he did not want to think about any of that , right now . He glanced again at his windows . " Yes , " he said . " Yes , Jack . I know why . You think that might affect this thing on Landers ? Well , do you think if I came in there to see you ? " " I 'm not in this , " the voice said immediately . " Not in it . " " Okay . Then I 'd better see Col Stevens here at the club . If I want to get involved . He comes out just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fine . If you want to get involved . And I 'll see you in town up at the Claridge . I 'll be coming in the next few nights . " " I 'm not sure I do want to get into it , " Winch said . He thanked him , for the call , before he hung up . For a moment he stared down at the black instrument . Then he went over to look out his big picture-glass windows . They were among the only third-floor windows in the only three-story building on the post . The view that met his eyes was a little breathtaking . As far as his eyes could see from his third-floor windows , through the rising mists of a sunshiny winter morning , collections of onestoryhutments and two-story barracks stretched in various lines , encompassing muddy drill fields and parade grounds . Secondarygravel roads and streets , their holes and low spots glintingback watery reflections of the winter sun , divided them . A few main arteries of asphalt , streaked with muddy vehicle tracks and smeared with the snail-like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Over everything lay a pall of coal smoke , adding to the mists . Far off over the huge rolling plain that seemed to begin at the foot of his building , but in fact began some two miles behind him out of visibility , clumps of taller treetops were apparent in the horizon-band of the woods . That was what all this area was like , before some astute citizen had got hold of his congressman and sold his piece of badlands to the government for a camp . Among the distant trees , way beyond the newest group of tarpaper hutments that they were building , geysers of black cloud rose silently , blowing up dirt and chunks of trees as heavy artillery units practiced range firing . Nearer in , companies and platoons and occasionally a full battalion of drab-clad men , helmeted and under slung arms , moved along the gravel streets of wet holes , exhaling streams ofp288steam that matched the steam emitted by the strings of vehicles . And Winch was , theoretically at least , the chief overseer of them all . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happened just as old T.D . Hoggenbeck had said it would . Just as old T.D . had envisioned it and set it up . The perfect sinecure . All you had to do was keep your nose clean . It was everything Winch had dreamed about , back in his misspent youth , back when he was bucking for his first staff rocker , to add to his stripes . Now he had it . Below his hands on the low sill a radiator sent a stream of hot air up at him . It merged with others , to warm the air of the office so that he would not feel the cold the men outside were feeling . Warmed enough to where his trim winter blouse with its new w/o insignias could be hung neatly over a chair back , the two rows of ribbons throwing color splinters . Winch continued to stand at his windows , rapt . If he had it , had it all so handily , so nicely , why did n't it make him happy ? Two full divisions were under training out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not Italy . Two full divisions . That was 18,000 men . And God knew how many other single , autonomous QM and Ordnance and Signal units . Winch could let himself think now about the allusion Alexanderhad made on the phone . Because Winch was looking right at it , out there . Canny , closemouthed , old Jack Alexander , the ex-pug , had alluded to the tightening-up that was going on in all of the services . The same little thrill ran up Winch 's back again . The United States was finally going into Europe . The United States , helped by Great Britain , was going to invade France . A few thousand men involved with command knew it . The public announcement , and the command designations for it , was going to come any day now . Men like himself and Alexander were not even told and taken into the secret . But they knew . Just about everybodyknew . The public announcement was n't supposed to come until around Christmas time . But these civilian draftees out there in the winter mud of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they could expect . European invasion . There had been rumors of it as far backp289as September , before the Salerno landings . Light rumors and heavy talk had flowed up and down the corridors of Kilrainey General about it . Any man who went back to duty would be getting back just in time for it . Now it was no longer rumor . It was definitely coming next spring or summer . In about six months or so . With it coming , as Alexander had pointed out , every service was tightening-up on AWOLs and insubordinations . That was the time Landers had to pick to get himself in trouble . Still staring raptly out his windows at the steam-exhalingmarchers , Winch watched the winter Mississippi rain begin to fall on them as the winter sunshine clouded over . It seemed almost the last straw to lay on them . But a lot worse than that lay ahead of them . He wondered how many of them would die in the coming big affair . Go down , disappear forever . A lot . Winch did n't really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And only temporary , at that . Let them die . Somebodyhad to . He cared more whether Marion Landers got his ass in trouble . Just as he cared more about damned Bobby Prell . And his mess/sgt , Johnny Stranger . Winch did not feel that strongly about the other old-company men . Perhaps it was because the rest had already been back awhile and had changed , before he and Strange and the other two had arrived . Or perhaps his life had become entangled with those three , on the long road back . The three of them meant more to him now than all these other men outside his window , sweating and blowing steam like broken-down , ruined horses in the winter cold . These others must have problems . And disrupted private lives . And wives , and kids , and maybe parents who lay awake nights worrying over them . Winch did n't really give a damn . Prell and Landers and Strange were what was left to him of his real life . Somewhere down in the deepest part of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nor explore , but consciouslyknew was there , was a strong feeling , a superstition , that if he could bring Strange and Prell and Landers through , without them dying or going crazy , and make them come out the other side intact , he himself might come through . And Winch 's nightmares had been getting worse and worse , lately.  |p290It  angered him into a fury , that Landers would let himself get into a bind at a time like this . Winch did not know whether he ought to get involved or not . Even Jack Alexander did n't want to be involved with it . Not right now . Any fool should know better . Times like this were the times when everybody 's righteousness came into play . Every cheap , mean prick like that Hogan got all puffed up and went looking for a victim , just to make himself some points . Hell , even honest men could n't help doing it . Maybe , probably , it would be good for Landers . Let Landers serve his three months , or six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after work at cocktail time , Winch cornered Col Stevens just the same , and held him captive against the bar at the Camp O'Bruyerre officers club . Stevens knew about Landers and his special court , right enough . And he did n't think much of it or of Landers . That came out at once , as soon as Winch brought the subject up . Winch did not bring the subject up until he had bought the old man at least three drinks . Winch had learned long ago how to handle officers in their own terrain . And being a warrant officer , with club membershipprivileges and the right to mingle on privileged ground and be an equal , was only carrying the old principle one step further . Respect was the secret . No matter what you really thought . All any old West Pointer wanted from you was the right to be fatherly . The higher the rank , the greater the father . All you had to do was keep on Sir-ing them , and not be cocky because you had moved up into officer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Respect . Not with obsequiousness , either , but with charm . Fortunately , Winch had not been standing behind the door when the charm was portioned out . He used all of it on Col Stevens . As he had been using it on everybody , since moving up into this rarefied atmosphere . " He was one of your old outfit , I guess . Was n't he ? On Guadalcanal ? " Col Stevens said dubiously . He leaned against the bar familiarly , at his ease . He liked to come out here from town because of all the old West Point buddies he had in Second Army Command . Winch was not unwilling to lie . When it was absolutely neces/sary . In a way , lying might be called the history of his life . " Yes , sir . Guadalcanal , " he lied . " But he was hit on New Georgia . " Stevens nodded . That had to count . " We have a lot of men out there who 've been hit on some island or some continent , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And most of them are a little goofy for a while . " " But not quite like that . Just what is your point , Mart ? " Stevenspicked up his glass , and smiled at it . " Do you mind if I call you Mart ? I 've heard a great deal about you , here and there . " " My pleasure , sir , " Winch said promptly , and smiled his most charming smile . Till his jaws ached . " I 've heard a good deal about you too , sir , or I would n't have approached you . My point is , I hate to lose his ability and his intelligence . That 's it , in a nutshell . " " Yes , of course there 's that , " Stevens murmured . " And what you tell me carries a lot of weight . I do n't want to do any good man in . " He shook his head . " But I 've decided that I do n't intend to interfere . I do n't really think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ask you to , sir . Least of all me , " Winch said . " But we all of us know , all us old Regulars , that the good civilian doctor Maj Hogan is  --  shall we say  --  a little overzeal-ous . " It was funny how you could pump yourself up till you fell into their way of talking ; their language . It was just a different way of saying things . Less direct . But you had to be careful then not to overdo it , and let them catch you . Stevens had smiled , then broken into an unwilling laugh , and now he blushed a little , embarrassedly . Cleared his throat . " Hogan 's certainly not a Regular , " Winch said . " Nor does he know how to handle Regulars . " " Your man Landers is not a Regular , either , I think , is he ? " Stevens smiled . " No , sir . He 's not . And as a matter of fact , he 's a **27;4910;TOOLONG student . That 's another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he acts more like a Regular than a draftee . " " I do n't know what to make of a man like that , " Col Stevens said , his brows knitted . " He ought to be putting his shoulder to the wheel . Especially at a time like this . " He eyed Winch , narrowly . " I le probably does n't even know anything unusual is going on , sir , " Winch said . " Everybody knows , " Stevens said . " Even my wife knows . "  |p292He  bit his lip , then exploded . Politely . But his gray eyes , which matched his hair , flashed . " I 've only had two courts-martial since I 've been out there . And both were only summaries . " " Well , there 's another way you could do it . You could bust him down to private , sir . " Stevens ' glass was on the bar , empty , and Winch signaled the enlisted barman for another . Stevens held up his hand and shook his head , demurring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " If you do n't want it , somebody else will , sir . " " You 're not drinking , yourself ? " " No , sir , " Winch said cheerily . " I 'm not . I ca n't . The doctors wo n't let me . But do n't let anybody tell you it is n't missed . I miss it like hell . " The old man snorted his laughter softly . The glass delivered , Winch suddenly stood away from the bar and held his arm out toward the room . It was getting more crowded now , more smoke-filled . " I 'm not keeping you , am I , sir ? I did n't mean to do that , " Winch lied . " No , no . No , no , " Stevens said . " Go ahead . I want to hear your point out . " " Well , it was n't much , sir . I just thought that you could bust him to private , " Winch said . " He 's a buck sergeant , you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clerk for a while . Before my battalion colonel stole him to make him his communicationssergeant . " He smiled again . Winch did not wink , but he did something with his eyes that was almost that . To clinch it , he added , " That was only a few days before he was hit . The battalion colonel did n't even have time to promote him . " " I 'm afraid busting him is beyond the authority I have , " Stevenssaid faintly . " These men are all transit casuals , you know . I do n't have unit authority over them . It would have to go all the way to Washington . " " It would still be better than a court-martial , sir , " Winch said . The colonel smiled . " I suppose it would at that , " he admitted . " But the point . You have n't made any point , Mister Winch . " " I do n't have any point , sir . At least , no point except the one I made , which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ice cubes and grapefruit juice on the bar . " It did seem a little strange to me though that the first lieutenant who was involved , the other man in the fight , did not think it worthwhileto prefer charges himself . " Stevens was staring at him , and continued to stare . " That'sp293true . You 're right . He did n't , did he ? " he said after a moment . " Did you talk to him at all , sir ? " " No . No , I did n't . Perhaps I ought to talk to him . " Winch picked up his lousy grapefruit juice and drained the glass to the ice , staring straight ahead . " It might be worth a shot , sir , " he said as he set the glass down . " Under the circum-stances . " That was the way they left it . Winch knew when to quit . Col Stevens offered a promise that he would talk to the 1st/it patient who was involved , tomorrow . Then he smiled a slightly crooked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mart ? I would be pleased to have had a commanding officer like you . I did have one , for a while once . " " Why , thank you , sir , " Winch said , and put up all that he could raise of the humility they thought you were supposed to have , into his most loving , most respectful smile . All he could think of at the moment was how quick he could get the fuck out of there . " Did you ever think of trying for a commission ? " Col Stevens asked . " No , sir . I did n't . I 'm not sure my health would be up to it , " Winch smiled cheerily . " Anyway , why should I start taking orders from everybody as a second lieutenant , when as a w/o I can give them . " Stevens smiled . " I suppose you 're right , at that . " " I think so , sir , " Winch smiled , with the same cheery smile . Outside , he walked to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was still falling . The Dodge was in the middle of the big new asphalt parking lot for the club . Winch felt as though he had expended as much energy as if he had played the full sixty minutes of a football game , and his knees were shaking . In the car he turned on the windshield wipers and just sat a minute . Grateful he did not have to compose his face into a cheery smile , again . The lights from the club , where he could not stand to be , shown out at him and glinted across the wet asphalt , and prismed through the rain-smeared windshield glass , sardonicallypromising comfort where he already knew there was none . I le could not remember ever having felt so desolate . He would have given everything he had ever owned for a drink , right now . Out in the air the rain had felt good on his face but in the car he was chilled . He was wearing his new $150 tailored trench coat and one of those brimless overseas caps which were re/quired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because of what the seam across the top made them think of ) . Ruefully Winch thought about the old campaign hats of before the war , and wished he had had one in the rain . The trench coat had a longer skirt than was usual and was green , the color that was " in , " now . The Dodge was the result of a deal Jack Alexander had engineered for him . In town in Luxor was a cozy apartment Alexander had known about , and Carol Firebaugh should be waiting for him there , soon . He should be saving his money , and not spending it on all this ritzy shit , Alexander had told him , or else how could he buy in on anything ? Any of the deals ? After a while , he started the car and the heater and drove home to his quarters . In the tiny room he drank the two remainingglasses of white wine in a bottle he had there , and without taking off any of his clothes except the trim winter blouse , fell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awakened by the phone , ringing . He woke confused , thinking it was the sound-power field phone from the battalion command post ; Col Becker . He was out in the big open field again . And fuck Col Becker . Col Becker could n't help . Col Becker could n't even see them , from where Becker was . The mortars were falling on them fore and aft , again . He could see that from where he stood . He was shouting and waving at them frantically and screaming again , " Get them out of there ! Get them out of there ! Ca n't you see what they 're doing ? They 're bracketing in on them ! Get them out of there ! " He bit it back with his teeth , as he sat up and looked at the ordinary , everyday phone as if it were some foreign , alien object on the little bedside stand . Even from this far away , he could see the'great white eyes of the platoons , ' white-white in their muddy faces , looking back at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black phone out of its cradle , and cautiously asked who it was , clearing his throat so it would not sound husky , it was Jack Alexander . He had not cried out . He was sure he had n't . As long as he did n't cry it out loud , the sentence , as long as he did n't tell  --  anybody about it , or need to tell anybody about it , as long as nobody knew , he would be all right , he was sure he would be . " Well , what do you want ? " he said , more sharply than he had meant to say it . " Do n't bite my head off , " the thick voice said . " I just calledp295up to congratulate you . I do n't know what you said to the Old Man but you sure sold him . " " I got him to promise to talk to that lieutenant , " Winch said . " Yes . No , I do n't mean about Landers . I mean about you . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away thinking you 're about the greatest guy that ever lived , " the voice said dryly . " I did n't tell him anything about me , " Winch said . " I of course did not tell him the truth , " the heavy voice said coyly , in a ponderous try at a joke . Winch tried to get hold of himself . " Yeah . I 'm glad you did n't give me away . " Alexander did n't waste breath on any laugh . " I 'm to get hold of that lieutenant tomorrow . The Old Man even called me at home . But I 'm on call to him all the time , anyway . So we 'll talk to the lieutenant tomorrow . Things are looking a good deal better for your boy Landers . " " But what we 've got to do is to get Hogan to withdraw all those charges . That 's the main thing . " " That asshole , " Alexander said . " He 's so anxious to get in good with Stevens , he 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't worry about him . " " Well , then it looks pretty good . " " Yeah . Yeah , it does . Say , listen , are you coming on into town tonight ? Because  --  " " I was n't planning to , " Winch said cautiously . " There 's a couple of guys from out of town going to be here , " Alexander said . " Important guys . It would be a good thing for you to meet them . " " I do n't know if I can , " Winch said . " But I 'll try to get in . " " Do it if you can . We 'll be at my game at the Claridge . They carry a lot of weight in certain places . Know senators and people . " The voice seemed to know that he was n't going to come , anyway , but nevertheless felt required to go on and do its duty just the same . " Okay , I 'll talk to you tomorrow , otherwise . " The voice and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat and looked at it . The nightmare , so familiar now in all its details , was as strong in his mind as the real conversation . He had no desire to be with Alexander tonight , and no intention of going to the Claridge . Desolation ran all through him and was like the taste of bitingp296on some old copper coin , in his mouth . In this mood he wanted only to be with Carol . His uniform was wrinkled from being slept in . He put the new winter blouse on over it anyway , without changing . Outside , it was still raining . It was about thirty-five miles in to Luxor . In the rain , peering out through the slow fan of the wipers , it would take him fiftyfiveminutes , driving on the old-fashioned , white-concrete highway . Alongside the concrete ran the two-lane blacktop road the government was building . Together they would make a fourlanehighway for the convoys into the city 's railroad station from O'Bruyerre . Winch settled into the driving , not wanting to think , wanting not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was right , of course , with his advice . There was nothing very tricky , or even very dishonest , about the way they were all making money . They did not do anything that your average businessman , after a government contract , did n't do . Mostly it was just knowing the right people . Knowing the right people , and passing along or picking up the right piece of informationat the right moment . Occasionally , very occasionally , it might mean slipping a small chunk of money along , too , at the same time . But mostly it was just knowing the right thing to buy . And to buy at the right time you had to have money , cash . Somebody had to own the Coca-Cola and Budweiser delivery systems that carried all the Coke and beer to all the PXs in the area . Somebodyhad to own the beer and soft drinks distributorships that supplied them . T.D . Hoggenbeck had explained it all quite clearly . Buy a bar , he had said . People will always drink . Come hell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drink . But before you could buy a bar you had to have that kind of money . And Jack Alexanderhad the means of acquiring that kind of money . That was why T.D . had sent him to Jack . Jack had the contacts , he knew the people involved . Jack was also , Winch knew , dead right about his advice . His advice , mainly , was to put by every nickel you could get your hands on . Then when the chance came to buy into some item , you would have the cash . Parts of enough such items , and you would begin to have the kind of money that could buy a bar , or two bars , or three , and pay off the politicians under thep297counter to get your package-store licenses , and pay for the highpricedlicenses themselves . That was all there was to it . It was easy . And , all that was just exactly what Winch was not doing . Alexander apparently knew there was some woman involved . But he did not know who Carol was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He would n't even ask Winch about it . As far as Alexander was concerned , it had to be some woman . What else would make Winch spend all his cash like some drunken docksidesailor . Who she was did not matter . " You 're going to regret it , " he would say mildly , with his scarred larynx . " Now is the time to buy in . These deals will all be gone , before long . " Winch would always shrug , and promise that the next time he would have the money . Faithfully , Alexander would come and tell him when the next deal opened . Faithfully , Winch would say he did n't have the cash again . " A cunt ai nt worth it , " Alexander said phlegmatically . Tacitly Winch agreed . A woman was n't . None of them was . " If it was n't for old T.D. , I 'd write you off , " Alexander saidmirthlessly . " And let you go to hell . " Winch could not disagree with that , either . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . some favors , Alexander would probably do it , too . But it was T.D . who had helped him put it all together . It was not that Winch was buying Carol fur coats and jewelry . It was not even that he cared that much for Carol , or was madly in love with her . Winch knew , now , already , how all that was going to end . Winch did not know where all the money went . He knew he spent it . Mainly it was spent in maintaining a certain life-style . A life-style which made his affair with Carol comfortable , and easy , for both of them . A life-style which made their affair , in a word not usual to Winch because he did n't think that way , un-dirty . Un-grubby . And underneath that truth was another truth , which was that Winch did not really give a damn . Down deep , half of him was glad whenever he could tell Alexander truthfully that he did not have the money for some deal . Half of him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not dispense it all on and around Carol ? What difference did it make ? It was not that he expected some return from it . Carol . She was quite an interesting girl , Carol was . In her own right . And so now , sitting over the wheel , behind the sweep ofp298the wipers in the rain , he was thinking . Exactly what he had hoped not to do . Was there ever a woman who did not always already have some man on the string , in her own right , that she was committed to ? None . Or very damn few . They were just like men . The idea of being alone , really alone , terrified them . So they clung onto whatever man they had , until they found another that suited them better . So , the only real alternative to taking a woman away from some other man ( who might not want her any more than she wanted him , until he found her being taken away ) was the rebound . And she was rare . A woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free . For a short while . Usually the life-span of a rebound did not exceed three months , at the outside . By then she would have found a new one . Rebounding was all in the timing . You had to know , quickly , when not to waste your time . Winch had been quite a rebounder in his day , back when women really meant something to him . It was right after the first time he had gone down on Carol that she had first mentioned her boyfriend to him . They were both lying nude on-the bed in the Claridge hotel room . He had not yet taken the little apartment . Carol was lying all sprawled out flat , arms and legs spread wide , staring at the ceiling . " Most men do n't like to do that , " she said faintly . Winch had to smile . " You mean , most American men . I supposenot . I like it . I like doing it , and I like giving pleasure . " She had such a magnificent young body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mound . So unworn by living . " Why do you think they do n't like it ? " " Oh , " Winch said lazily . " I suppose it 's our American religioustraining . American Christianity . Sex is all scrambled up in with our religion . Evil , dirty , filthy . Guilt . It should n't be . It 's all very primitive . Medieval . But it 's all tied in with our puritan-ism . " " I never thought of it quite like that , " she said . He felt a certain pause of intensity in the air , before she spoke on . She was still staring at the ceiling . But stiffly now . " My boyfriend  --  up at school  --  does n't like it at all , and wo n't do it , " Carol said . Instinctively Winch sensed he was expected to react to this . A test balloon . From where he lay on his elbow , looking over , looking down at her , he saw her eyes roll toward him once , thenp299flick back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed to waver around for a focus up there , on it . He smiled . " He wo n't ? " he said , easily . " He does n't ? " He let a little pause develop . " Well , he 's very young yet . " " Yes he is ! " Carol said vehemently . Her eye focus never left the ceiling . " Did you ever go to a whorehouse ? " Winch had to laugh . " Me ? Yes . Sure . A lot of times . " " He goes to a whorehouse a great deal . " Winch chewed on this a moment . He was , for no reason he could isolate , enjoying himself immensely . No jealousy , no anguish . No pain . " He probably tells you he goes a great deal more than he actually does , " he said . " Why ? " " To show off . " " It 's the only way I can climax , " she said . " What you did . Unless I play with myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Winch smiled , " very few women can come from simple fucking . " " Really ? " " Yes . " " You do n't think there 's anything wrong with me , then ? " Winch shook his head . Climax . That must be one of her collegewords . He had noted that she never would say the word come . It had struck him , suddenly , that perhaps she might be lying to him about the boyfriend 's whorehouses . Could she be lying to him about the boyfriend , too , then ? She was n't lying . " I like to do it that way , too , " she said . " Like it . Like to do it . But I 'd never dare try it , with him . Never dare even suggest it . " " We can arrange that easy enough , " Winch grinned . " Do you mind if I talk to you about him ? Tell you about him ? " " No , " he said . " Not at all . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and since then . He had been Carol 's boyfriend , off and on , since high school . He was the second boy she had ever slept with . The first was a secret . Still a secret , even now . She had pretended to be a virgin with the boyfriend . She thought he had believed her . She had quit him once in high school for a while . For an older boy , a college boy . Then she had gone back to him . She had gone to Western Reserve up north largely on the suggestion of the collegeboy , who did not go to Reserve , but who was studying top300be an actor . The boyfriend had followed her . He had intended to go to Mississippi down at Oxford . But he had found out he could study business administration at Reserve . And he said he could not stand to be away from her . At Reserve , she had left him twice , after stormy quarrels , but had always come back to him . It had been hard for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone to Ole Miss . Once he decided to follow her , though , he had fought his family hard . But he was so insular . And so fixed . And stubborn . He was exactly like all the parts of Luxor she had wanted to get away from . At school both times she had left him she had had affairs with older persons . Once with a senior boy , when she was a sophomore . Once with an English instructor , a married man , when she was a junior . Both , of course , had been impossible situations . Untenable . Both times the boyfriend had accepted her back , without any questions . He had been a perfect gentleman . Half of her , or some fraction less than half , had wished he had not been . He always had wanted them to marry , as soon as they both graduated , when he came back home to go into business . She had never agreed . She had refused to become engaged officially . He was just so damned insular . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was when he talked about going to a whorehouse . Lying naked on the bed beside Winch that first night she talked about him , Carol had suddenly blushed , all the way down into her breasts . Once at a party , when he had gotten drunk and crude and jealous , and had passed out , in a fit of anger she had gone off with a lone dateless man , and had slept with him , outside , in the back seat of one of the cars . The boyfriend had never suspected . " I 've never told that to anyone . " " It 's safe with me , " Winch smiled . " I do n't want to be a Southern belle , " Carol said . She paused a moment thoughtfully . " But I 'm afraid I 'm a Southern belle , anyway . " " You 're a beautiful Southern belle , " he said , emphasizing the descriptive adjective . She raised her head off the sheet and looked appreciativelyp301down along her nudeness , blushing again . " Not like in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm not , " she said . This had been in mid-November . And quite soon after , it came out that the boyfriend was coming home from school for Thanksgiving . She would not be able to see Winch for a few days . Perhaps a week . She hoped Winch would not mind . She hoped he would not hold it against her . She hoped he would not be jealous . And that it would not  --  change anything . Winch had smiled . " No . It wo n't . I 've got plenty to keep me busy . " " You wo n't be lonely ? " " No , I wo n't be lonely . " Suddenly she laughed . " Damn you . " He smiled . " Well , maybe I 'll be a little lonely . " That was better , she had said . " You see , I ca n't help being a Southern belle . " When she came back from Thanksgiving , the first thing she said was that the boyfriend had said he " knew I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you think he knew ? " " He said he could tell by the way I acted . I was too happy . Of course , I denied it . " And now the same thing had come up again lately , about Christmas . The boyfriend was coming home for Christmas vacationfrom school . She would not be able to see Winch for quite a while . Maybe three weeks . And of course by now Winch had the apartment . " I 'll try to sneak away and slip off at least once , " Carol said . " Do n't worry , " Winch had smiled . He was back to duty by now , out at O'Bruyerre , and busy in a very real way . He did not really know what he thought about the boyfriend . He apparently was just a good , solid , generally good-natured , thoroughly fucked-up , upper-class Southern boy . Winch certainlydid not envy him his marriage to Carol  --  if and when it came to pass . And Winch felt pretty sure it would come to pass . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything . " He wants me to be like his mother , " Carol said about him once . " And at the same time , he halfway wants me to be his whore . " " But if you 're his whore , you ca n't be like his mother , " Winch smiled . " Exactly ! "  |p302But  it was curious Winch was not jealous . He was n't . The time she spent with the boyfriend at Thanksgiving did not bother him . He did not conjure up painful pictures of her in bed with him , and brood about them . Instead , he felt he was very lucky . More than anything . A lucky weekender . Perhaps it was just age . And his physical condition . But , what the hell , he was getting it up with her now more than he ever had with any woman , for quite some time . She was blowing him well , he was teaching her . And he was blowing her well . Apparently . And the fucking they had going was of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his years ask for ? Suddenly , a picture of his white-eyed platoons , wherever they were , blossomed in his head . And with it , screamingly , came up the single , silent sentence of his nightmare . Get them out of there ! Damn it ! Get them out of there ! Winch bit it back . But on the wheel , his hands were slippery . The apartment Alexander had found for him had been the biggest single item of expense . He had had to pay a large sum under the counter , in cash , to get it . The monthly rental was high . The next biggest item was the car Alexander had put him on to . And the black-market gas Alexander had made him privy to . Lately , after her revelation of the expected Christmas visit , Carol had begun asking his advice about various things . This tickled a fatherly perversity in Winch . For the moment , it was the boy 's military status . He had a deferment , until he graduated in the spring . Then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bogus local deferment . But the boyfriend wanted to enlist right now . Quit school and enlist . It was going to be the big fight of their Christmas . Winch had told her to tell him to stay out . Whatever else happened , stay the hell out . And if he did go in , he should get his father to get him some kind of a commission , preferably with a job in Washington attached to it . Suddenly , under the wipers , a white picture formed on the windshield glass in the rain , as though it had been etched by Steuben or one of those big glassmakers . It interfered with Winch 's vision of the road in the headlight beam . Winch stared at it , engrossed , as it took clearer shape , and recognized it . It was Jacklin . Pfc Freddie Jacklin ? He was one of the men , one of the dead , from the platoons . The forever beleagueredp303platoons of Winch 's mind . The glass picture of him was an exact replica of the way Winch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gently sloping forward slope of a knoll . Not much grass . Winch had glanced back once , a scanning look , before going into the jungle that came part way up . Jacklin had been lying there . He was facing downhill , on his back , his head thrown back , one arm out one arm in , a grimace of intense effort on his face , above the open mouth and eyes , his big chest extended as if still trying vainly to draw air . Winch had not known where he was hit . Had not even known he 'd been hit . Now he was on the windshield , etched in white bevels and lines and grooves , and he was obstructing Winch 's vision . Whereverhe moved his head or eyes , the figure moved in front of them . A fucking obstructionist ! By peripheral vision Winch could see the car was edging toward the road edge . He tried to adjust his steering , but could not do it fast enough . The right front wheel , then immediately the right rear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the scream of rubber , and the rending of metal , and then the car was halfway in the roadside ditch , front end down , but turned clear around and there was silence , the motor turning over and ticking in the quiet . Automatically , Winch turned off the ignition . Then just sat in the stillness for a while . It was the first time any of his nightmares had actually impinged upon his outside physical world and affected it . That would bear some thinking about . As he sat , he realized slowly that there was nobody at all around , anywhere . Fortunately , he was able to back out . The metal damage was negligible , mostly a bent headlight , fender and bumper . He could still drive it . Luxor was still five miles off . Nothing happened the rest of the way . As if satisfied , the figure of Jacklin did not return . At the apartment , which was the upstairs of a private home downtown not too far from the Peabody , he parked the damaged car and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upper floor . Inside , Carol put down the book she was reading and stood up . All the lights were on , the way he liked it . She was fully clothed . She hated to undress herself or lie around half-nude , **25;4939;TOOLONG ? The whole testimony of her life dictated that she assume responsibility for these three , and the vanishing of her own children was an added persuasion . But she also had a sense of harsh reality and knew that these children had been born in the marsh , of the marsh . Their father was a weak man , lacking in character , and their mother was worse . In these children there was not good blood . They promised small likelihoodof achievement ; intuitively she sensed that with them she could accomplish nothing . She had come to believe that the human stock populating this world was wondrously uneven . When she goaded her son into marrying Amanda Paxmore , there was not even a remote chance that the little Quaker girl would turn out badly ; she came from solid stock , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the irreducible integrityof Edward Paxmore . She trusted that her sons at Bohemia would grow into stalwart men upon whom Devon could depend . But the childrenof her silly sisters across the bay  --  what timid and fragile things they would be ! The three Turlocks now wandering in the yard came from damaged sources , and she was convinced that no matter how much love and force she applied to them , she and they would end in heartbreak . They belonged to the marsh , and to move them elsewhere would be cruelty . Take them back , Stooby , ' she said . I seventy-three , ' he said . Soon I die . The children ? ' They 'll find a way . ' Please , Mrs. Steed . Your children , not mine . ' No , ' she said firmly . She would not try to share the reasoning behind her decision , nor would she retreat from it , but when Stooby pointed out that he had not the wherewithal to rear the children , she promised , ' I ' 11 pay for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children back to the sloop , his shoulders sagging and his white hair shining in the sun , she was satisfied that whereas he must be disappointed now , he would in the long run see that she was right . She kept her word . She followed what was happening in the marsh and saw to it that Stooby had the funds needed to raise the abandoned children , but when she heard that he had given them the name Steed , she sent word that this was not wise , and thereafter they were lost among the Turlocks . Stooby did not die soon , as he had feared . Because of his sturdy life in the woods , and his lean competence in caring for himself , he lived on and on , giving Nelly 's children the love they needed and an introduction to swamp life . By the time the boys had left their teens , they were accomplished watermen , and because they had acquired Stooby 's intense interest in birds and river things , they became the principal suppliers of soft crabs and oysters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their sensible progress , thought : I was so correct in not taking them from their natural home . That day they were like waves which had ventured far inland , making a mark they could never again achieve . Now they 've receded to their tidal level , and there they prosper . Her own sons prospered too . In December of 1718 they returned from Bohemia polished young scholars , for the Jesuits had taught them Latin , Greek , Italian and French , and they were as familiar with Thucydides and Cicero as they were with the Douai Version of the Bible . They knew little of hunting geese or trapping beaver , but they understood the nicetiesof St. Thomas Aquinas and were , as the letter from the Jesuits said , ready for the rigors of St. Omer 's . ' Rosalind agreed that they must continue their studies in France  --  ' Where in today 's world could a young man find better instruction ? ' But the thought of sending them across the Atlantic on the May convoy struck terror in her heart , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all ravaged the Chesapeake . After the mass hangings of 1713 there had been a diminution of piracy , but in 1716 a dark meteor had blazed across the Caribbean , Edward Teach , a man of horrible cruelties known as Blackbeard . In Jamaica he had roared , Warn that Bitch of Devon we 'll be along to revenge the good men she hanged . ' Twice he had ventured into the bay but had kept to the Virginia shore , wreaking enormous devastation , and at each burned plantation he told some victim , Tell the Bitch of Devon we have n't forgotten her . ' Rosalind 's response had been instantaneous . She had offered the Englishnavy her five ships , and the financial returns from three convoys had been sacrificed while her captains prowled the Caribbean , searching for Blackbeard . That canny criminal , trained as a British privateer in the War of the Spanish Succession , eluded them , and then in late 1718 word reached Virginia that he had holed up in a North Carolina inlet . Volunteerswere called for , and Rosalind sent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bay . You ca n't sail to France , ' she told her sons , as long as Blackbeard roams . He 's sworn to kill you , and me as well , and we must wait . ' In the interim she held the boys close to her . They were the descendantsof men who had resisted pirates , and if she had asked them to sail against Blackbeard , they would have done so , but she was satisfied to keep them at Devon . Samuel was almost seventeen , still outgoing and occasionally fractious ; Pierre evaluated problems more sagaciously and remained more cautious in his responses , but she was pleased to see that each respected the other and consciously made concessions in order to sustain the bond . They formed a strong pair , and Rosalind thought : They 'll be able to run Devon once they get back from France . While everyone waited for news from Carolina , she instructed her sonsp302regarding the plantation : Do n't ever make our garden pretty . And when you marry , promise me you 'll never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It smells and is the mark of those who have never really loved gardens . They make a game of box , mazes with it , and waste their gardeners ' time keeping it trimmed . ' Pierre asked what plants she did respect , and without hesitation she replied , Pyracantha . It 's gangling and sturdy and most handsomely colored . ' Sam said , You 're describing yourself , ' and she confessed to the similarity . They were together when the geese prepared for their long flight north , and although she was moved by their departure , the boys were not , and this frightened her . You must live close to nature . Books and priests are not life . The coming and going of the crabs down there in the river . . . that 's life . ' She led them to all parts of the plantation , pointing out the characteristics of the soil , the life history of the various plants she was endeavoring to grow , and always she managed to pass the marsh which stood at the head of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of complicated life . She was there one day when herons came , their long awkward legs projected in front as they landed on the shallow water . Those are the birds I love . . . so patient . . . so permanent . ' Her sons began to see their patrimony through her eyes , and to appreciate the heavy responsibility they must assume on their return from St. Omer 's . And while you 're looking at the plants and birds , ' she told them , keep an eye free for the girls . Which ones would fit in with an island ? Which would be solid companions ? And good mothers like Amanda ? Try them all but pick the winner . ' And then , when it seemed that the May convoy would not dare to sail , the Fair Rosalind rushed north from Carolina with news that caused citizens to drop to their knees in the middle of the road and give thanks : Blackbeard is dead ! ' Rosalind Steed 's ships , supported by others from the colonial navy , had pocketed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engaged him in hand-to-hand combat and slain him with a cutlass . The pirate 's severed head , which had uttered so many threats against the Bitch of Devon , took its last ride stuck to the end of a Steed bowsprit . When the news reached Patamoke , guns were fired and Rosalind ordered all members of the Steed family to attend the public prayers held on the wharf , and there she stood , solemnly holding the hands of her sons , as the minister cried in exultation , The long siege has ended ! Tonight we sleep in peace ! No town on the Chesapeake has done more to vanquish pirates than ours , and standing amongst us is a woman who never faltered in that fight . ' On the peaceful sail back to Devon , Rosalind told her sons , If you everp303engage in a notable enterprise , and you will , see it to the finish . ' Sam asked , Is that why the Refuge Steeds call you Rosalind Revenge ? ' But before she could respond , Pierre said , I shall think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , That I like better , ' and she thought : I do not want my sons to think of me as always fighting against men  --  their father , Bonfleur , Blackbeard , Judge Broadnax . I could have been friends or partners with any of them . If they had let me . If they had been decent human beings . In May , when the great convoy finally assembled  --  two hundred and thirty ships this year  --  she had no hesitation in placing her sons aboard , for she was satisfied that when their studies were completed they would return to assume their responsibilities as the new Steeds of Devon . With her sons gone , she was totally alone . There was the house to complete , but that scarcely engaged all her energies . What she needed was life , the growing of children as well as the prospering of trees , so in humbleness of spirit she asked her slaves to ready the small shallop , and when a calm day arrived she got into it by herself and sailed across to Peace Cliff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the telescopehouse . There she sought Amanda and made peace  --  I need you at Devon . And I think Beth needs the island . ' Her granddaughter was a lively child of eight , with amber braids peeking out from beneath her Quaker bonnet . When she curtsied and shook hands , Rosalind thought : This one 's bound to be a notable woman . She 's just the age to profit from the relaxation of a Catholic home after all this Quaker severity . But Amanda was thinking : Rosalind 's the most honest and courageous woman I know , but she is dominating . We 'd not be on Devon a week before she 'd want us both to become Catholics . So she said no . I respect thy intentions , but I sense that things will be much safer if Beth stays here . This is her destined life , and Devon could only be a distraction . ' She would permit no extended discussion , and in the end Rosalind had to go back down the hill , get into her shallop and sail home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gentlest of winds pushing her along , she reflected on the irony of recent events : Stooby wanted to give me Fitzhugh 's three children , but I refused them on the proper grounds that they could never fit into Devon patterns , and I was right . Now I seek my husband 's granddaughter , and Amanda refuses on grounds which I suspect are equally right , that she would n't fit into the Devon pattern . Well , I have my sons , and they 're the best of the lot . . . bred true . . . offspring of Cavaliers . It was possible that her preoccupation with children sprang not from love , for which she had always possessed an enormous capacity , but fromp304a necessity to feel herself involved in the ongoing processes of life , and it was a happy accident that just as her family existence became most empty , an event occurred which propelled her into the heart of Choptank affairs . At the home of Judge Thomas Broadnax , husband and wife combined to terrorize the little bastard girl consigned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Penelope , shortened to Penny , and had made of her the most abused and menial kind of serf . They provided barely enough clothes to keep her warm and only such food as she required to stay alive . Together they believed that their harshness was ordained by God as punishment for the child 's having been born out of wedlock , and that when they chastised her , they were doing His work . For any infraction of the intricate laws they laid down , she was beaten . If she dared to protest , she was chained to the wall of a dark closet , and beaten afresh when released . Her arms bore permanent scars , and if any older person made an unexpected move toward her , she cringed . Judge Broadnax always explained to her , in heavy legal terms , why it was proper for him to beat her until the blood flowed and why it grieved him to do so , but it was Mrs. Broadnax who terrified her . The judge 's wife could be a demon , striking and scratching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approach her with a heavy tray of food , which Mrs. Broadnax gorged while the hungry child stood attentive at her elbow . One day , when the persecutions became unbearable , the little girl ran away from the Broadnax home , fleeing aimlessly to any refuge that might preserve her from the judge 's fury . By accident she stumbled into the Paxmores ' boatyard , but when the older brother saw her , and realized that she had run away from the Broadnax home , he became quite frightened , for the harboring of a runaway indentured servant was a principal crime , and he would have none of it . Brusquely he shoved the child away , knowing that if he kept her , he would be subjected to the judge 's wrath . Bewildered , the little girl wandered down the road until she came to the Steed warehouse , and there Rosalind happened to be inspecting some fearnought in which to clothe her slaves , and when she saw the battered child , and the scars along her arms , she impulsively caught her up and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fear . Cardo , give this child something to eat . ' It was only when Penny was stuffing herself on cheese that Rosalind discovered who she was . Judge Broadnax ! He beat you like this ? ' She had barely established the facts of his brutality when Mrs. Broadnax stormed into the warehouse , demanding to know whether her runaway servant answering to the name of Penny had been seen . . . There you are , ungrateful child ! ' But as she reached to recover the little criminal Mrs. Steed interposed : You 'll not touch this child . '  |p305She  belongs to me . She 's a disobedient hussy . ' Do not touch her . ' Mrs. Broadnax , not catching the ominous quiet in Rosalind 's voice , imprudently came at Penny , intending to twist and pinch her arm as she led her away . Instead she was confronted by the powerful form of RosalindSteed , who with one substantial shove sent her sprawling backward among the barrels , over which she stumbled , landing flat on the floor . Do n't touch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power , for if you try again , I shall kill you . ' It was a fearful statement , heard by several , and these witnesses could also testify that after having said this , Mrs. Steed gathered the child into her arms and carried her to the town wharf , where they went aboard the Steed sloop , despite the fact that Mrs. Broadnax warned her in a loud voice which she must have heard , If you harbor that child , you 'll rot in jail . ' The warrants were sworn , and the constable 's boat sailed out to Devon with them . Satisfying himself that the child Penny was indeed on the island , he mournfully came back  --  It 's shameful to arrest a woman like Mrs. Steed . But she 's done wrong and I suppose she must pay . ' The trial was a sensation , long remembered in Maryland records . Judge Thomas Broadnax presided , seeing nothing wrong in acting as adjudicator in a controversy involving his wife , and he was properly grave in manner . He allowed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman  --  her outbursts against authority , her specific threat to kill the judge 's wife , and especially her disgraceful behavior in disrobing at the public whipping of the Turlock woman , a known whore . As each new bit of evidence unfolded , with the various Steeds in the audience crimson with embarrassment , the judge became more pontifical and serenely compassionate : Do you mean to say that a gentlewoman like Mrs. Steed uttered such profanity ? ' He shook his head in sad disbelief . But he was miscalculating his adversary . During the first day Rosalind sat silent as the hurtful evidence piled against her . She realized that she was being tried not for kidnapping an indentured servant but for an accumulation of petty offenses against the male community : that she was a Protestant who more or less adhered to the Catholic faith ; that she had defended the Turlock woman ; that she had sometimes driven hard bargainsin the purchase of land ; that she had sent her sons to Bohemia and then to St. Omer 's ; and most of all , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been silent . Curiously , not less than six . witnesses testified to the fact that she was building an outrageous house ; that seemed a real sin . At the close of that first day it was apparent that Judge Broadnax would be justified in sentencing her to jail or at least to the ducking stool , but when the second day began , the climate changed . With remorselessp306force Rosalind produced witnesses willing at last to testify against their infamous judge : he had beaten the child senseless during a dinner ; he had forced her to work shoeless in the snow ; he had provided one dress , and one only , which she had to wash on Saturday nights and wear still damp to church on Sunday . On and on the cruel testimony came , as if the community wanted to purge itself of secret connivance . On several occasionsJudge Broadnax tried to halt the testimony , but his companion justices , tired of domination and seeing a chance to rid themselves of his obstinacy , overruled him . One of the most telling witnesses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ describe in quiet detail the condition of the little girl when Mrs. Steed invited her to Devon to see for herself . Amanda , a small woman in demure gray , created such a powerful impression , and was so relentless in her description of the bruises and the scars , that women in the audience began to cry . Judge Broadnax interrupted to point out that the Bible instructed masters to chastise their servants if they misbehaved , and he might have carried the day , for Maryland society in I720 allowed little sympathy for runaway servants ; by custom they were thrashed and returned to their masters with the duration of their indenture lengthened . Any who connivedin their delinquency were sent to jail . We are here to preserve the sanctity of contracts , ' Judge Broadnax reminded the jury . What would your farms and businesses be worth if the servants you honestly acquired were allowed to roam free ? Tell me that , if you please . ' At this critical moment , when the trial hung in the balance , as if justice were truly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much trouble to find . They had known Broadnax 's servant girl Betsy , mother of the bastard Penny , and on five separate occasions she had confided to them certain facts about Penny . Judge Broadnax , ' Rosalind asked quietly , but with a menace and contempt she took no pains to hide , do you really want these women to testify ? ' You bring liars into the court , ' Broadnax thundered . It 's to no purpose , but if they want to make fools of themselves . . . and of you , Mrs. Steed . . . ' He shrugged his shoulders , and the first woman , a servant of no repute , took the stand . Betsy told me that it was the judge who came into her bed . ' The next woman , of no better reputation , testified , Betsy told me the judge had his way with her . ' And the next woman said the same , and then Penny herself was put on the stand , to say in a weak , small voice , Before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father . ' When Rosalind 's turn came she admitted all charges against her : in anger she had said that the judge ought to be poisoned , and in greaterp307anger she had struck Mrs. Broadnax and threatened to kill her  --  But I did so because there was evil amongst us . ' How did you know that ? ' one of the subsidiary justices asked . I knew when I read the record . And you should have known when you allowed the record to be written . ' What record ? ' Of this court . ' And she recited , as best she could , the hideous record of a judge who had testified against his own servant 's pregnancy , had caused her to be whipped , had taken her child into a lifetime of servitude and had then abused that child most cruelly . In beating the child , Judge Broadnax was punishing himself for his own sin . In abusing this little girl , Mrs. Broadnax sought revenge against her husband . There is uglinesshere and guilt , but not mine . ' The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to this day : ii November 1720 . In that Rosalind Steed of Devon has been found guilty of making violent threats against Thomas Broadnax of this town and his wife Julia , and because of her constant harranguing , she is sentenced to three submersions on the ducking stool . Thomas Broadnax , PresidingAlloway Dickinson , Justice Quorum Samuel Lever , JusticeThe Choptank was cold that day . A wind blew in from the west , throwingsmall whitecaps and warning boats to stay ashore . The air was somewhat warmer at the inner harbor , where the long-beamed ducking stool was located , but the water was icy . A huge crowd gathered at the shore to watch the Steed woman receive her punishment , but there was no elation among the watchers . There was general agreement that the justices had acted properly : Penny had run away and had to be returned as an admonition to other servants ; Mrs. Steed had harbored her and that was clearly a crime ; and she had been an abusive woman , throwing her tongue into places it was n't needed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Judge Broadnax 's , and he was not only unpunished but he had the little girl back to abuse as he wished for the next twelve years . There was something badly askew in Patamoke , and the citizens knew it . So Rosalind marched to the ducking stool in silence , chin high , still opposing Broadnax in all things . She remained arrogant as they strapped her into the chair , and refused to close her eyes at the final moment . Instead she took a deep breath and stared at Thomas Broadnax with a hatred that almost inflamed the November air . And then the chair ducked toward the dark water.  |p308What  happened next became the subject of endless repetition and delighted discussion . It was the custom when ducking a difficult woman who had irritated the men of town to hold her under water until her lungs nearly collapsed ; it was a terrible punishment , accented by stranglingand mocking voices . But on this day , by previous arrangement among the townspeople , the stool went in and out of the water so swiftly , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one woman said approvingly , She scarce got wet . ' When the men swung the stool inboard and unleashed their victim , the crowd cheered , and women ran forward to embrace her , and Judge Broadnax thundered , That was n't a ducking ! The order of the court said clearly  --  ' But the people had left him . They were with Rosalind , congratulating her and kissing her , while he stood by the harbor  --  alone . It was the custom on the Eastern Shore to give the homes of leading citizens names , and some were of such wry charm that they would persist as long as the land endured : a contentious man finds peace at last in a remote farmhouse and christens it the Ending of Controversie ; a parcel of land is conveyed under debatable circumstances and the home built on it is named Crooked Intention ; not far from Devon Island a man builds his dream home and names it the Cross of Gold , but he does so in French , Croix d'Or , and before long it becomes Crosiadore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colonial experience : Bell 's Folly , Bell 's Persistence , Bell 's Triumph . It was understandable , therefore , that the name given in derision to the brick mansion on Devon Island should become permanent : Rosalind'sRevenge . At night , in taverns , some would argue that it stemmed from the builder 's remorseless pursuit of the French pirate Bonfleur . Others remembered that the words were first uttered when Fitzhugh Steed quit the island to live openly with the Turlock girl . But most believed , or wanted to believe , that it represented Mrs. Steed 's triumph over the cruel judge , Thomas Broadnax : He had the power to order her ducked , but she went in and out like a mallard and lived to see him flee the town in disgrace . We started to laugh at him and his bitch wife , and this they could not endure . Rosalind had her revenge . ' It was a strange house , totally wrong and out of balance . The Flemish bond , instead of producing a beautiful facade , looked heavy and lacking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basic design , for which Rosalind was to blame . Various observers , including the Paxmore brothers , had pointed out that what she was building was nothing better than an unadorned cube : Each of the four sides is a square of identical size . This is monotonous and adds no beauty . ' One of the brothers reminded herp309rest . She had ignored the criticisms and for nine years had obstinately pursued her plan of erecting a perfect cube on the foundations of the original Steed home . But when observers saw the mistake she was makingwith the two chimneys , they had to protest . One of her ship captains , who had seen the fine homes of England , pointed out , To give balance , the chimneys must stand at the two ends of the house , not side-by-side along the rear . ' He took paper and drew a sketch of what he had in mind , and it was superior to what she was doing . At least , ' he pleaded , if you wo n't put the chimneys in their proper place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pleasing balance . ' She ignored his recommendations , and in 1721 , ten years after she started , she had her cube completed . Only one aspect was satisfactory : the front facade did have a classical balance , with a central doorway of austere cleanliness , flanked on each side by a pair of well-proportioned windows . On the second floor appeared five windows , smaller than those below but centered exactly , the middle one positioned over the doorway . Somehow these ten nicely related openings , framed in white against the Flemish bond , gave the cube stability and quiet elegance  --  without them the house would have been a total disaster ; with them it was merely a failure . Ruth Brinton Paxmore gave her last testimony one cold First Day in November 1721 . She was eighty-eight years old , but able to walk unaided from the town wharf to the meeting house and with firm step to ascend to the waiting chair on the facing bench . She wore gray as usual , and a small bonnet with the strings loose over her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Amanda . Her appearance evoked mixed emotions among the Quakers of Patamoke : she was the leading voice on the Eastern Shore , a woman of demonstrated sanctity , but she was also a bore . In spite of admonitions and incessant defeats , she persisted in dragging slavery into almost every private conversation or public statement . The Patamoke Meeting had repeatedly rejected her suggestion that the ownership of slaves disqualify a Quaker from membership in the society . The Yearly Meeting of the Eastern Shore had done the same , as had the larger general meetings in Annapolis and Philadelphia . The Quakers were eager to point out that a slaveholder must treat his slaves well , as the Bible directed , and they developed a further doctrine which irritated many non-Quakers : the just ownership of slaves must see to their Christian salvation and to theirof the traditional Choptank wisdom : At first , a wee bit house for you and the wife . When babies start coming , a little larger . And when money comes , you add a real house . That way , each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reforms Ruth Brinton wanted to initiate , there was no support , and she was deemed a nuisance . She 's our hair shirt , ' many said , . and when she rose to speak , they squirmed : The facts are few and stubborn . Slavery in all its manifestations must be eradicated . It is not profitable to the farmer nor fair to the slave . Every aspect of society is impeded by its existence , and if we on the Eastern Shore persist in this extravagance while other sectionsrely upon free labor , we must slide backward . For a long lifetime I have listened attentively to arguments thrown against me and I find substance in none . The Quaker program must be simple and straightforward . While the African is still a slave , educate him . As soon as possible , manumit him . If that is impractical , at thy death set him free in thy will . And within a decade state so that all can hear , " No man or woman who owns slaves can be a Quaker . " ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revealed message , she resumed her seat , and two days later died . Her death had unanticipated consequences for Rosalind . Four days after the burial in the little graveyard behind the meeting house , Amanda arrived at Devon bringing Beth with her . The bright little girl was now ten and ready for solid instruction in the books which had made Rosalind so firm of character . We want to live with thee , ' Amanda said in the reserved and precise manner of her grandmother , and Beth and I both deem it timely to employ a tutor . ' We 'll buy one , ' Rosalind said abruptly , and she took Amanda and the child to Annapolis , where numerous young men more or less qualified as teachers were offering their indentures for sale . We 'll buy the best , ' Rosalind said , and he can set up a school for all the Steeds , ' and this she did . The young man was a gem , a graduate of Cambridge in England and a practicing Catholic . Philip Knollys was the kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything at a level which enabledhim to expostulate with bounding confidence . He was only slightly brighter than Beth , but he did know how to keep boys and girls free of riot , and as soon as he established his noisy , effective school for the seventeen Steed children , Rosalind told her cousins from the Refuge , Here 's a young man we must keep . ' These were happy years for Rosalind . She positively cherished Amanda as one of the most sensible young women she had ever known , and with her took an almost malicious pleasure in being a renegade Protestant who loved the complexity of Catholicism . Beth , of course , was enchanted by Knollys and under his tutelage was inclining toward Ca/tholicism ; when her uncles returned from St. Omer 's they found her well advanced in Catholic doctrine . It 's a shame girls ca n't be educated , ' Pierre complained to his mother . Our little Beth is quicker of mind that we were . ' Little Beth had her own plans for further education ; as soon as she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intended marrying the tutor . He was summoned , and stood facing Rosalindand Amanda with charming arrogance ; he was all of twenty-nine and with one year to run on his indenture , and Rosalind asked , Is it proper for a man still a servant to seek the hand of a young woman he is obligated to teach ? ' Before he could respond , Beth interrupted , Thee is asking three separatequestions . How can he possibly answer in one swoop ? ' What three questions ? ' Like a little lawyer , her chin jutting toward the bench , she replied , First , is it proper ? Anything in good conscience is proper . Second , does he have a moral obligation to me as his student ? He has , and he has discharged it . Third , does his being a servant disqualify him ? It does . But that can be quickly remedied . ' How ? ' Rosalind asked contentiously . Terminate his indenture . Now . ' Amanda agreed , and when that was done the little girl rushed to Knollys ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held under the oak , with Father Darnley , an old man now , officiating in half-drunken jollity . Amanda was shocked , for Quaker weddings were solemn , but since Father Darnley had married her many years ago , she was willing to grant him indulgence . Now Rosalind had time to proceed with the building of her home , and when a new tutor was purchased to take over the Steed school , Mr. Knollys was free to help . He had a considerable knowledge of geometry and carpentering and gladly assumed control of the slaves assembled for the final effort . As the months passed , and Rosalind revealed her intentions , Knollys caught her infectious enthusiasm and assured everyone in Patamoke , It 's to be the finest home on the Eastern Shore . ' Those who had laughed at her stumpy original cube with its misplaced ' chimneys and unsatisfactory end walls could see at last what she had always intended . Using it as the solid center of her construction , she built at some distance east and west two slightly smaller cubes , each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lower roof lines than the main building . When they were finished they looked as peculiar as the central cube : squat , heavy buildings without any pleasing adornment except the rigorous arrangement of their front facades , where four windowssomewhat smaller than those in the main house gave balance . When asked what the two strange appendages were , Rosalind replied ,  |p312Rooms  far the children we 're all going to have . ' And the children did come , so that the new tutor was kept busy instructing a seemingly endless supply of Steeds , while Rosalind continued medicating them . To her emergency supplies she had added ginseng drops , most effective in treatingthe flux , and Venice treacle for childhood coughs . A woman in Patamoke had introduced her to burnt hartshorn , a bitter substance which produced good results when used to combat congestions , and it was now possible to get steady supplies of turmeric from London , and this was certain to cure weaknesses of blood . But the medicine which made life among the mosquitoes bearable was the new one called simply the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some magic tree , extremely bitter , which attacked all fevers and ate them up . A child can be prostrated with fever , shaking as if a dog worried him , and five applications of the bark puts him on his feet again , ' Rosalind told the Steeds at the Refuge , and when they followed her advice , they found that their summers were twice as comfortable as they had been previously . The bark was a miracle , and on Devon Island only Mrs. Steed was allowed to dispense it , which she always did with a promise : Enjoy its bitterness . It 's going to fight on your behalf . ' And then , in 1729 , she disclosed the final plan for her home . Using a huge pile of bricks assembled over the past two years , and goading Knollys ' slaves to extra efforts , she made various bold moves . At the original cube she tore out large segments of the two end walls , and at each of the flanking buildings she did the same . It looked as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worked so long to construct , but when all was prepared , she put the slaves to the exciting task of erecting two low , compact passageways , each with three windows , which bound everything together . These new additions were not large enough to be considered houses , but they were built with such solidity that they were obviously parts of the whole . When challenged as to what they were , Rosalind said , On sunny days I shall sit in these warm , comfortable rooms and sew . ' These were the lovely connectives that bound the cubes together into one magnificent home . When the rubble was cleared , and the lawns raked , and low shtubs put in place to hide the scars of building , Rosalind 's Revenge stood revealed , and no part of the beautifully balanced five-part structure was more ideally suited to its purpose than the original cube which had evoked such cynical merriment . Now it was clear why she had placed her chimneys at the rear : the passageways could not have been added if the chimneys had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why the end walls had been left so bleak : she had always intended that they be pierced for the passageways . How stately the great house was , with five separate roof lines , with twenty-four matched windows in a facade that moved forward in thep313center , slightly back at each end , and well back at the passages . Especiallysatisfying was the manner in which the house fitted the trees , which she had planted well before the building was begun , so that when a visitor arrived at the wharf and looked northward , he saw a stretch of lawn not too spacious , a collection of trees not too numerous , a house not too ornate , so that he was tempted to exclaim , How well-proportioned it all is. , What the visitor could not see was that in a corner of the main room Rosalind had caused a cupboard to be built , and here she preserved the pewter dishes rescued when the pirates burned the preceding house . A few of the pieces had been somewhat melted by the flames , but all were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ended , she liked to assemble all Steeds for a banquet of gratitude that the year had passed without disaster . Then she would allow the children to eat off the pewter plates , and feel the dense hand of history , and she would tell them , You can never foresee how a house or a human being is going to turn out till the work is completed . ' And when the Refuge Steeds had departed in their boats , she gathered her own family to instruct the children in their heritage and told them of how Edmund Steed had come to America with a courageous Catholic heart to build this plantation , and of how his wife Martha Keene had fled England to share the wilderness with him , and then she told them of King Charles , whose head had been chopped off , and this part the children loved for its gruesomeness as she described the falling of the ax . Then , with just the right mixture of high adventure and travesty , she told them who Prince Rupert was , and of how he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ king , and then she asked , And who do you suppose rode with him ? ' Chilton Janney ! ' the children cried . Yes , your great-great-grandfather . He was a Cavalier and he rode with Rupert at Martson Moor . ' And then one of the children would say , But you always said he was dead drunk . ' I never saw him sober , ' Rosalind would confess . And he was n't a real Cavalier , ' another child would say , and she would reply , In his heart he was . ' At various places in this chronicle certain phrases have been used relative to the Choptank which might lead one to think it a peaceful stream : She got into her shallop and sailed to Peace Cliff or They sailed idly down the river past the marsh . ' And for twenty-nine days out of thirty these descriptions were apt and these actions possible . The Choptank was a splendid body of water ; indeed , that spacious area between Devon Islandp314on the west and Patamoke to the east was practically a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rosalind Steed could traverse it with impunity . It was on such a day in October 1732 that she left Rosalind 's Revenge , walked down to the wharf and asked the slaves to prepare her shallopsailing to Patamoke . ' One of the older slaves said , Better tomorrow . Clouds over the bay . ' She rejected this advice  --  We always have clouds somewhere . ' As she sailed down the placid creek she came upon a cove black with geese , home from the north , and she thought how beautiful they were , but then a solitary heron came to the edge of a small marsh to fish for crabs , and she thought : I always wanted to be a stately goose but was destined to be an awkward heron . Well , the goose comes back now and then with a show of glory , but the heron stays forever . The river was incredibly beautiful as she entered it for the easy run to Patamoke ; the banks were lined with oak and maple turning myriad shades of red , and above them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Paxmores ' telescope house , so different from the manor she had built , so perfect in its Quaker dignity , and she thought : A remote corner like this , and within a few miles , we have two of the most handsome houses in America . Her eyes lingered on the gray house and she could visualize old Ruth Brinton moving about the plain kitchen , and tough-minded little Amanda learning her lessons of integrity . But as she passed the cliff and headed for the marsh the sky darkened and from the bay came winds of force . And then , within the space of minutes , a storm of tremendous fury engulfed her little world . Rain came down in slanting sheets ; the wind roared to forty miles an hour , then fifty ; whitecaps as huge as those thrown up by the ocean ripped across the river ; and her shallop was tossed and tortured . Within the first half-minute she had the sail down and the shallop running with the wind : I 'll let it push me ashore . . . anywh4re @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no matter . She was following standard procedure for the Choptank ; since the entire Eastern Shore was alluvial , a sailor never had to fear putting his craft upon the rocks , for there were none . When trouble threatened , the waterman allowed his boat to move toward shore till it scraped bottom , then he got out and walked through the waves to safety . But on this October day the waves would not permit this escape ; they tossed the shallop until Rosalind had to relinquish the rudder and cling to the sheerstrake to avoid being washed overboard , and when in this position she saw a succession of really monstrous waves coming at her , she realized what peril she was in . We 'll see it through , she said to herself , bracing for the shock of the first wave , and by strength alone she clung to the violently pitching boat.  |p315When  the last of the big waves roared by she gasped : That was a near thing , very near . And she began to take deep breaths , watching in dismay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water . There was still j a good chance that she could ground the boat and struggle ashore , so she ; returned to the rudder stick , endeavoring to restore the shallop to a reasonable course , and she might have succeeded had not a mighty gust swept in from the bay , throwing the entire river in confusion . Waves moving in one direction were tormented by new ones raised by the howling wind ; the shallop rose on one heading , twisted in midair , turned and tumbled violently . Rosalind was thrown clear , but she still fought to reach shore , which she had every chance of attaining , except for the broken mast which struck her from the rear , tangling her feet in its swirling lines , dragging her down and down . Turlock children , surveying their marsh after the storm , spotted the wrecked shallop and yelled to their elders , Boat ashore ! ' And when all the family ran into the marsh prepared to steal any movable parts , they found Mrs. Steed half buried in the sand , her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she died.  |p316ONE  OF THE MOST IMPORTANT JOURNEYS EVERundertaken along the Chesapeake was also one of the shortest . It covered less than twelve miles , but when its ugly mission was completed , a revolution had been launched . The Lords Proprietor of Maryland had always enjoyed the right of advowson , a feudal privilege which they sometimes discharged in ways that could not be fathomed . All citizens of the colony conceded that the lords had the right to appoint their own clergyman to any Church of England vacancy which occurred , but no one could comprehend how even an absentee owner who lived in London without ever having seen Maryland could have appointed to the rural church at Wrentham a man so totally devoid of religious conviction as Jonathan Wil8ok . This monster arrived at the rich living located a few miles north of the headwaters of Dividing Creek one November day in 1770 , two hundred and eighty pounds of blackmail , simony and self-indulgence . The blackmailaccounted for his having obtained this enviable sinecure : he had caught young Lord Baltimore in a situation which was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and when he pointed this out to the profligate he also suggested , If you were to give me the living at Wrentham north of the Choptank , I 'd be no threat to your safety . ' The simony consisted of his selling at maximum profit to himself all services of the church . He would not marry , christen or bury without substantial fees , which had to be paid in choice tobacco , and he also abused his position by driving the hardest possible bargains in acquiring real estate for his private use . There was no transaction so venal that he would not resort to it , if only it showed promise of gain.  |p317But  it was his self-indulgence which put him in bad odor with his parishioners . Possessed of an appointment from which no force on earth could remove him  --  neither the Bishop of London who despised him , nor Lord Baltimore , who feared him , and certainly not his flock , who had no rights at all except to pay his handsome salary and keep silent  --  he was free to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seven nights a week , siring two bastard children , maintaining a foulmouthedwife and a mistress , and propelling his vast and sweaty bulk into any problem whose resolution might yield him an advantage . It was loathsome that the Church of England should suffer from the misbehavior of Jonathan Wilcok , but traditions of the time absolved him , and if the scandals he generated did damage the church , they did not obliterate the splendid work done by other devoted clergymen whose appointments had been similarly made . The Rector of Wrentham and his brethren represented the Established Church of Maryland ; their existencewas approved by king and Parliament and their conduct was beyond reproof . On balance , they performed acceptably , in the proportion of seven worthy ministers to three rectors of Wrentham . At dawn on a cold day in January 1773 this clergyman , now well over three hundred pounds in weight , rose early , bundled himself in swaths of homespun , over which he slipped a clerical garb with stiff collar and white tie , studied himself admiringly , and said to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ community . ' Then he informed his four slaves that he would be sailing to Patamoke for the court session due to convene at noon . Imperative I be there . The future of the Choptankis at stake . ' So he slaves readied two horses and brought out the rude palanquin which hung suspended between them . Then they informed the rector , " All 's ready , Master , ' and he waddled to where his contraption waited . It would have been quite impossible for him to walk on his own from the church to the head of Dividing Creek , a distance of three miles , but he was able to negotiate the few steps to the palanquin . However , when he got there he was incapable of climbing in , for the thing swayed and refused to stay steady . So one of the slaves stood between the two horses , quieting them and the palanquin ; two took the rector by his arms and moved him backward while the fourth remained in front , pushing on his huge belly . Now ! ' the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ master into his conveyance . Grunting and sweating even on this cold morning , the rector cried , Forward ! ' and one of the slaves walked ahead , leading the two horses , while two others pushed from behind ; the fourth man was supposed to jump into any emergency to ensure that the fat man did not fall out . In this manner the pilgrimage reached the stream where the episcopalp318barge waited , and there new complexities arose , for the mammoth clergymannow had to be eased out of his palanquin , walked across a slippery wharf and let down into the boat . Finally this was accomplished , to the accompaniment of directions shouted by everyone , and as soon as the rector landed safely in the barge he made himself at ease , lay back on seven pillows and roared , On to Patamoke . ' When he arrived at that thriving commercial center , children and idlers passed the word , Here comes the Rector of Wrentham ! ' and all ran to the wharf to enjoy once more the extraordinary manner in which he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men : from the barge the four slaves pushed and grunted while on the shore two others threw down a rope , which was passed around the fat man 's back and under his armpits , each of the men retaining one end . Then , as the men on shore counted , One , two , three ! ' everyone exerted maximum force and grandly the rector rose from the barge as if on wings and slid ashore . Again , as soon as his feet found security on the wharf , he became composed and grandiose , the traditional figure of a benevolent clergyman . Throwing his coat about him , he nodded graciously to the townspeopleand walked with ponderous dignity toward the courthouse , his porcine face wreathed in condescending smiles . As he entered that low stone building he noted with pleasure that all was in readiness : the bench was occupied by justices well disposed to his cause ; the three culprits were waiting to receive their just punishments . The defendants were an unlikely trio , with nothing but their common guilt to form a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Simon Steed , aged forty-three , was a tall , austere , thiii-shouldered man who treated the court , the spectators and his fellow criminals with equal disdain . His clothes followed the French style , a taste he had developed at St. Omer 's . His wig was powdered ; his stock was starched ; his shirt had fourteen buttons and was touched with lace ; his blue velvet coat came almost to his knees ; and his pants ended just below , marked by small silvery buckles . At his wrists a fringe of gray lace protruded , lending an air of elegance when he moved his arms . He was a gentleman , the wealthiest man in the community , and to see him standing in the dock like a common criminal was exciting to the townspeople , but from the deference they paid him it was obvious that their sympathies lay with him and not with his accuser . Beside him stood a man just turned forty , distinguished by the fact that he wore a broad-brimmed flattish hat which he refused to remove even when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , one of the principal supports of Patamoke Meeting and head of the Paxmore Boatyard , whose workmen were putting in doubled hours during these years of stress . He was a somber man , dressed in a long gray coat marked by nine frogs , with no lace at the wrists and no silver buckles on thep319shoes , but he , too , displayed a kind of elegance , for the cloth of his coat and pantaloons was of the best . He was obviously offended at being summoned to court and refused to acknowledge the gestures of good will thrown his way . The third man had often stood before this bar . Thin , quick of movement , rascally of eye , he captained a miserable old sloop that traded the Chesapeake . He came from the marsh and was dressed accordingly : improvised shoes made of animal hide ; no stockings ; baggy pants held about the waist by a tattered rope ; heavy woolen shirt but no coat ; no hat ; and a dark beard . He was Teach Turlock , and even his name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father had named him after the pirate Blackbeard , a man who knew what he was up to . ' Forty-one years ago , when the prisoner had been named , Blackbeard was still a fearsome memory , for he had ravaged the oceans , and two gentlemenhad gone into court to force old Turlock to give his son a proper name , and the court had so ordered : on the record his name showed as Jeremiah Turlock , but universally he was known as Teach , which even his enemies had to admit was proper , for he displayed most of the enduring qualities of that pirate . The social and moral principles of the three defendants were as varied as their clothing . Simon Steed was an avowed supporter of the king ; he had little patience with those agitators in Massachusetts and Virginia who were uttering treason , and he hoped devoutly that ill-intentioned men in both America and England might soon be brought to their senses . Levin Paxmore held aloof from political discussion ; he felt that God ordained governments and that men had no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was Teach Turlock who represented the new spirit abroad in the colonies ; he was a potential revolutionist , not from principlebut from an ugly desire to get even with those stationed above him . When men talked in whispers about rebellion , he fingered his gun . Only the intrusion of some alien force as powerful as the Rector of Wrentham could have enlisted these three unlikely companions in a common cause , and now that gigantic , puffing servant of the church wheezed his way to the front of the court , gingerly lowered himself into a broad chair and signaled to the justices that the trial should begin . The tax collector testified first . Time out of mind , all good citizens of this district have delivered to me before the last day of December thirty pounds of choice tobacco to be handed over to the Rector of Wrentham as his salary for maintaining the Established Church in our district . ' Has this always been the law of this colony ? ' the presiding judge asked . Your father 's day and mine . Your honors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' And the three judges nodded self-righteously.  |p320Has  anyone failed to payT the presiding judge asked . These three . ' You 're the tax collector . Why did n't you take action ? ' The tax collector blushed uneasily , looked down at his feet , then said in a high , whining voice , The other rector told me , " Leave them alone , damned Papists and Quakers . God will punish them . " But our new rector '  --  and here he looked approvingly at the fat man  --  he intends to straighten things out . ' Howl the judge asked . Each of these three must pay ten years of tithes . Our rector insists upon it as his due . ' And you asked these men for their tobacc  --  ' I did . ' And did Simon Steed refuse to deliver his three hundred pound  --  ' He did . Said he was Catholic and refused to pay . ' Did Levin Paxmore fail to delive  --  ' He did . Said he was Quaker . ' And did Teach Turlock also refus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each of these men on three separate occasions , as required by law , to pay their assessment  --  ' I did . ' And did each refuse three time  --  ' They did . ' The constable testified that as soon as the tax collector notified him of the delinquencies he personally did his best to collect the three hundred pounds , but had been rebuffed . Mr. Steed , if it please the court , was grandly indifferent ... refused to notice me ... told one of his men , " Get that fellow off my property . " Friend Paxmore , the one with the hat on his head , behaved quite different . I 've had to arrest him before for not serving with the militia , and when he saw me coming he asked in a low voice , " What does thee want this time ? " and when I told him " Three hundred pounds for the chapel , " he said , " Thee knows I ca n't pay that . " ' And what did you sayTI said , " Thee knows it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and even Paxmore allowed a faint smile to relax his lips . Did Turlock offer to payT the judge asked . He offered to shoot me . ' This , too , occasioned laughter , but the constableadded , He had no gun and I judged it was only a manner of speaking . ' But he did offer to shoot yourIn words , yes . ' Now came the time for the rector to testify . Ponderously he struggledp321out of his chair , adjusted the white stock beneath his pendulous throat and said in precise , educated manner , Time out of mind it has been the revered custom in this colony for every man , woman and child above the age of sixteen to help pay the rector 's salary . This provides funds for the poor , maintains the church buildings for worship , and gives proof that all citizens pertain to the church and volunteer to protect it . If even one person refuses to pay , the entire structure of our Christian faith is put in jeopardy , and this the courts have always recognized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the church to collect its just fee , and I demand that they be fined ten times thirty pounds and sentenced to jail for their contumely . ' You 've heard the charges , ' the judge said . Turlock , have you aught to sayTThe waterman shrugged . Friend Paxmore , can you offer any justification ? ' The tall Quaker shook his head . The judge then asked Steed , but before the planter could respond , the rector objected . Your honor , it would be wise , I think , not to allow this man to speak in open court . He was educated in France , where he imbibed the pernicious and debilitating doctrines of atheism . He has imported the books of Voltaire and Montesquieu and has loaned them to any who could read French . He has even gone so far as to find a copy of Candide done into English , and this , too , he has disseminated . Whateverhe chooses to say will be seditious and irrelevant . ' But the justices agreed that Steed be allowed to speak , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dealing with all problems , he proceeded to interrogate the rector . Do you hold that even Catholics and Quakers must pay the yearly tith  --  ' I do . ' Even when tobacco is so hard to come byT Before the rector could respond , Steed asked , Where would Teach Turlock get tobacc  --  ' Others do . ' You have n't answered my question . Wher  --  ' I am not concerned with the household problems of Teach Turlock . ' And by the distasteful look he threw at the waterman he indicated that he had never been interested in Teach 's moral problems , either . ' In a time when tobacco can scarcely be found , all other branches of government have agreed to accept their assessments in flax ... or corn ... You alone insist on tobacco . WhyTBecause the Lords Baltimore entered into a solemn covenant with God to give Him thirty pounds of choice tobacco per head per year . ' Steed walked to where a farmer and his wife sat . Standing beside them , he asked the rector , Did you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his assessment ? '  |p322He  offered it . ' How many acre  --  ' Sixty-seven . ' Do you now own , in your name , not the church 's , a total of three hundred and seventy acres of the best Choptank farmlan  --  ' The rector of any parish has the right to live in a comfortable house and farm his land . ' Three hundred and seventy acres ' wort  --  ' It 's land that has come to me honorably . ' Did you propose last year that I cede you fifty-three acres west of Dividing Creek ? ' You owed it to me . ' And how large will your holdings be at the end of this yearTThe rector appealed to the court , and the justices agreed that this was inflammatory , whereupon Steed started a new tack . What charities have you paid for in the last twelve month  --  ' If anyone had come to me  --  ' Did n't Peter Willis come to yourHe was notorious . To have given him aid  --  ' Whom did you aid ? ' Steed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who railed , Whom ? Whom ? And whom are you to question me in this wayT yVery quietly Steed said , I merely wanted to know what charities . ' The fat clergyman appealed again to the court , and again they sustainedhim . Mr. Steed , the Rector of Wrentham is not on trial . You are . ' I apologize , ' Steed said humbly . But I must ask one more question , which is perhaps even more intrusive than the preceding . ' Watch your deportment , ' the presiding judge warned . Rector Wilcok , these are difficult years . Strange voices are being raised in the land  --  ' He speaks sedition ! ' the rector warned . The time may soon be at hand when England will need every cham-pion  --  ' He speaks French sedition ! ' Do you not think it might be prudent if , in such difficult times , when you already own so much property  --  ' Sedition ! Sedition ! I will not listen to such questioning . ' The justices agreed . Mr. Steed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questions of the most pernicious tendency and have sought to bring into the quiet precincts of this court the passions which excite the multitudes outside . You must sit down . ' Those passions , sir  --  ' Constable , sit him down . ' That officer was not required ; Steed bowed to the justices , bowed top323the rector , and with a grace that could only be called exquisite , wheeled and bowed to the farm couple whose lands had been stolen from them . Then he returned to his chair with the other prisoners , where Levin Paxmore clasped his hand . The prisoners will rise , ' the presiding judge intoned , and when they were before him he said gravely , Especially in these troublous times is it necessary that the traditions on which our colony is based be observed with extra diligence . Time out of mind good men have paid part of their increase to the church which protects and guides them . Now more than ever we need that protection and guidance , and for anyone , Catholic or Quaker , to deny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Steed and Levin Paxmore , you are each ordered to deliver to the church at Wrentham three hundred pounds of tobacco well and truly casked . ' The dissidents nodded . And as for you , Teach Turlock ... ' At this portentous opening , the disheveled waterman turned to the spectators and grinned , as if to say , It 's me they 're talking of . ' The judge continued , You have no tobacco , nor any means of acquiring any . You have no personal goods worth the taking , but you do have a deficit of three hundred pounds , so this court orders that you cede to the Rector of Wrentham eighty acres of the fast land you hold north of the marsh . ' The grin vanished . The scrawny waterman looked in dismay at the bank of justices , appealing silently this terrible verdict : they were wrestingfrom him land which he cherished , which his ancestors had acquired from Indians and protected with their lives against wolves and mosquitoesand tax collectors and Steeds who had wanted to plant it in tobacco . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward the bench , he cried , NoP The constable pulled him away , but in doing so , thrust him in the direction of the rector , who was at the moment hauling his ponderous bulk out of his chair . Without considering the wrongful thing he was doing , Turlock leaped at the fat man and started beating him about the face . The court became an uproar , and after the constable and two farmers had quieted the fiery waterman , the presiding judge said balefully , In jail , six weeks . ' And the waterman was dragged away . When the court was cleared of spectators , the justices accompanied the rector to the wharf , where with the aid of six men he was loaded back onto his barge . The presiding judge walked along the shore , throwing obsequious farewells to the clergyman , but his two companions stood soberly on the quay and one said , Next year , believe me , I will no longer enforce the claims of that pious wretch . ' It 's the law . ' Then the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Edward , ' and the second judge looked to see if anyone had heard the treason . These are dangerous times . I 'm an Englishman , born , bred and consecrated , but recently I 've begun to fear that London ... ' Be reasonable . Teach Turlock deserved jail ... for a score of reasons . ' But not to have his land taken . ' What does he care for landTDid you see him when Arthur delivered the sentence ? And Steed and Paxmore ? They 're good men . ' They 're dissidents . The time is coming when all must pull together . ' The judge who spoke first looked toward the main street of Patamoke , then indicated that his companion must look , too . What they saw was Simon Steed and Levin Paxmore walking arm and arm , deep in conversation . Do you realize , ' the first judge asked , that here this day we 've performed a miracl  --  ' A strange word , miracle . ' Yes , we justices have made it inevitable that three men as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common ground . I warn you , we 'll see the day when those three and others like them will strip the fat Rector of Wrentham of all his lands , and after that they 'll  --  ' Edward ! I pray , do n't finish that sentence . ' The second judge put his hands over his ears to blot out his associate 's final judgment . Ideas will be set in motion which all the justices in this county will be powerless to halt . '  |p325THE  TWO JUSTICES WERE WRONG IF THEY ASsumedthat Steed and Paxmore were talking treason . They were discussingcommerce , and when they reached the boatyard Paxmore invited his co-defendant into the plain wood-walled office from which he conducted his business . What makes thee think that vessels will be at a premium ? ' Paxmore asked as they sat on chairs he had carved from oak . The hatred I saw in Turlock 's eyes ... when the justices took his land . ' The Turlocks are always savage . ' But this was different . This was a declaration of war , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Of what ? Turlock 's powerless ... ' Of the spirit . There 's an ugly spirit abroad , Levin , and sooner or later it will engulf us all . ' And that 's why thee wants vessels ? Against days of riotTExactly . I think the day will come when people like you and me who want to maintain ties with England will be pushed to the wall by the canaille . ' Thee has the advantage of me . I did n't study in France . ' The mad dogs ... the Turlocks . Soon they 'll be shouting that the colonies should break away from England . England will resist , as she should . And I 'm afraid there might even be war . ' He hesitated , looked nervously at the floor and whispered , If war does come , we shall need ships . ' Paxmore , seeking to ignore the awful freight of those words , took refuge in nautical pedantry . Friend Steed , thee uses terms carelessly . A ship is a very large vessel with three masts or more . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  |p326Steed  , also eager to avoid talk of war , asked , Which should I buil  --  ' Neither . Thee wants a schooner . Able to move about with speed . ' And each man sucked in his breath , for each knew that a commission had been offered and accepted , and this was no trivial matter , for if Steed was prepared to pay for a schooner , he must allocate to it a substantial portion of his wealth , and if Paxmore undertook to build it , he must put aside the lesser projects on which his normal income depended . So the two men sat silent , contemplating the obligations they were about to assume , and finally Steed spoke . Moving briskly to the desk , he jabbed it with his forefinger . Speed , Levin . Above all else , we must have speed . ' Now it was Paxmore 's turn to act decisively , and for him this was an intense process . Without rising , he began to twitch his body , turning his shoulders and edging his elbows back and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someone unfamiliar with what he was doing . Years before , Steed had told men at the store , When Levin Paxmore thinks of a schooner , he becomes that schooner . ' And now the canny builder wrestled with those problems which had agitated the most ancient shipwrights . Finally , at the end of his contortions , he said , Thee can have speed , but thee ca n't have speed and maximum cargo . I can pull the lines out this way '  --  and he indicated the length of the intended vessel  --  but that means I must squeeze her in here , just where you 'd want to stow the hogsheads . ' Forget the hogsheads . This schooner will be hauling compressed cargo of treble value . ' We should keep the freeboard low , but the masts must be extra tall . We 'll need a spread of canvas . ' I 'll want a very stout superstructure . ' That 'll decrease speed . ' But I must have it . For the cannon . ' At this word Paxmore placed both hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cannon aboard one of my vessels , Simon . ' I would n't ask you to . But you build stoutly , so that when you 're through I can place the cannon . ' I could not agree  --  ' You leave the spaces  --  four of them . ' But that would make it top-heavy , ' Paxmore warned , and as soon as he spoke these words he realized that Steed had tricked him into connivanceon a military matter , and he drew back . I am not building some great ship of war , ' he warned , and quickly Steed assented , Never ! Ours is to be a small schooner of peace . ' For two days the men planned the vessel that was to become the hallmark of the Paxmore yards : sleek , swift , maximum canvas , minimum beam , sharply formed bottom , lively tiller , fantastically protruding bow/sprit . It was to be a schooner defined by a businessman , executed by a poet , and at every critical point each man made his decisions in reference to a view @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ careful analysis of what he saw happening in the colonies . Simon Steed saw that hotheads like Teach Turlock were going to nudge the colonies closer and closer to a confrontation with the mother country and that agitations of vast dimension were going to disrupt trade and the normal use of oceans . This probability influenced him in two ways . He knew that in time of turmoil adventurous traders prospered , for they were willing to buy and sell when others were immobilized by anxiety . And he was also spurred to daring ventures by remembrance of his grandmother 's stubborn fight against pirates ; like her , he believed that the seas must be kept free . He was therefore willing to take risks and was prepared to pay not only for the vessel he and Paxmore were planning , but for three others in swift succession , for he saw that with a fleet of four he could trade in these troubled times with sharp advantage . But that he would do so under the British flag , now and forever , he had not the slightest doubt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had built many oceangoingvessels , but they had been stodgy affairs : snows with ridiculous paired masts , and brigs with stumpy ones . He had always known that better craft lay waiting to be built among the oaks and pines of his forests , and sometimes when he had seen a large British ship putting into the harbor outside his boatyard , her lines trim and her three masts justly proportioned , he had felt pangs of artistic regret : I could build better than that , if anyone would buy . Now he had his customer , a man with insights at least as profound as his own , and he was eager to start . He would do so as a Quaker pacifist who abhorred war , and it never occurredto him that cooperating with Steed would lead him step by step to compromise those convictions . So these two men of good intention launched their project believing that they could pursue it without surrendering past allegiances . Dimensionsof their schooner had not been agreed upon , but at the close of that second day they proposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measurements ; however , shortly after dawn two slaves sailed to the ramp at the boatyard with the exciting news that a trading vessel had put into Devon from London , bringing Guy Fithian and his wife on an inspection tour . Were they made welcom  --  ' Master Isham 's wife , she said come in . ' Simon Steed had never married and at forty-three had no interest in doing so ; he ran the family business , read speculative books sent over from Paris , and allowed his younger brother Isham and his wife to supervise the social life of the Steed empire . If Isham had extended thep328courtesies , there was no need to quit the exciting business of laying out a great schooner , so Simon told his slaves , Sail back and assure Fithian I 'll be there by nightfall . ' No , Master . He say come now . ' And one of the slaves handed Steed a brief note from his brother advising him that grave news had arrived from London . His presence was mandatory . So Steed told Paxmore , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days . What size shall our new craft beTThe two men , in shirt sleeves even though the January day was brisk , began to step off the proposed dimensions . I 'll want her longer than before , ' Paxmore said . I 've been thinking that we must go to eighty-four feet and some inches . ' And he drove two pegs to indicate that considerabledistance . Longer , rather than shorter , ' Steed said , and he moved the pegs slightly . Narrow in the beam , something under twenty-one feet , ' and again Paxmore drove his pegs . I like that , ' Steed said . Gives just enough room to swivel the cannon . ' The Quaker ignored talk of ordnance , but standing in the middle of the design , he said , I think we must go to a depth of eight or nine feet in the hold . Of course , Steed , you wo n't be able to navigate in the shallow waters of the bay . ' We keep to the channel ... to the ocean . Make her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she 'll come in at a hundred and sixty tons . ' For the remaining two hours the men reviewed all aspects of their decision , and when they were satisfied that they had reached a sensible compromise on many conflicting demands , Paxmore called one of his nephews and said , Martin , that large oak we 've been saving . Start it into a keel , ' and before Steed left the boatyard the reassuring sounds of an adze were echoing . On the brisk and pleasant sail back to Devon he tried to guess what kind of information might have caused his brother to send that imperativenote : Since it came from Fithians , it must have originated in London . And since there 's no longer war with France , it must concern the colonies . Something about politics . Then he frowned . Could it possibly be business ? Surely , Parliament ca n't have passed legislation damaging to our trade . He was convinced that London would not be so foolish , and his reasoning was original : The one staff the king must lean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Only we can hold the rabble in restraint . And at this thought he flinched , for the sloop was passing Turlock 's marsh , and he visualized that hot-eyed radical wasting in jail , planning vengeance , and this encouraged him to summarize ideas whichp329had been brewing for some months : Society must be a compromise between new , untested men like Turlock , who want to destroy old patterns , and old , tried men like Paxmore and me , who tend to cling too long to the patterns we 're trying to protect . He speculated on this for some minutes , and true to habit , whenever he dealt with large concepts such as society , mankind and change he began to think in French , and this was the fatal canker in his character : by every external sign he was fitted to be an English gentleman , except that he had learned to read French books , and these had corrupted him . He was enormously captivated by Montesquieu and had spent one summer evaluating the Frenchman 's challenging theory that the governanceof man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : executive , legislative , judicial . It had never occurred to him that those were the functions of government , but under Montesquieu'sexquisite tutelage he saw that this was the case . But as soon as he reached this conclusion , he drew back from its logical consequences : The best way to attain this balance is by following the English system . A just king , a stalwart Parliament , a wise group of judges . It was contradictory : in all his practical applications he was an Englishman ; in all his basic attitudes toward goodness of life he was a Frenchman . And now he turned practical : It would be a tragic day if our colonies ever felt tempted to break away from England , and when his boat touched the Steed wharf he bounded up the path , hungry to discover what kind of crisis had brought Guy Fithian across the Atlantic . People inside Rosalind 's Revenge heard him coming and hurried to the door to meet him , and there for the first time he saw Jane Fithian , many years younger than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her capable husband . She was so compelling in a light-blue dress of India cloth with its bodice of delicately applied lace , that she seemed to float toward him , extending her hand and saying in a soft voice , Hullo , I 'm Jane Fithian . ' Welcome to Devon , Mrs. Fithian . ' Oh , no ! ' She laughed merrily . I 'm his sister , not his wife . ' At these words he blushed so deeply that everyone watching , even the slaves , knew that he was excited by this elfin English girl , and as soon as he found himself alone with Guy he asked , Why did you bring herT and Fithian replied with no embarrassment , Because it 's high time you were married , Simon . ' The words , and the intention behind them , were so bold that Steed blushed again and was about to protest when Fithian said , What really brings me is disaster ... twofold . ' And he proceeded to spell out the worsening situations which had made an ocean crossing imperative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the great plantationswith which we 've done business . . . well , they 're bankrupt.  |p330And  if we continue to extend them credit , we 'll be bankrupt too . ' We 're solid , ' Steed said defensively . Would to God all the American plantations were in your condition . You and Isham know how to work , how to keep things in balance . ' He shook his head gravely . Simon , would you have any interest in taking over Janney 's  --  that big plantation on the Rappahannock ? ' Without a moment 's reflection Simon said , No . ' Is n't it somehow related to your famil  --  ' Vaguely . But of no interest to us . Is that why you camelJanney 's is only one of a score . Do you realize that factors like us own most of Virginia ? I represent a consortium . Six London factors , and we 're being asked to absorb American debts amounting to millions . You call these places Maryland and Virginia . They 're really Fithians and Goodenoughs . ' In great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and saying , We own the damned plantations , and we dop't want to . Simon , at least come with me to see what can be done about Janney 's . You owe me that . ' Again Steed protested that for an Eastern Shore man to fiddle with a plantation in Virginia was insanity , but Fithian stopped him short . Like it or not , Simon , we 're all caught up in insanity . ' And the gravity with which this trusted old friend uttered these words forced Steed to listen . You feel safe because you run your plantation and stores prudently . Well , government in London seems determined to drive you out of business . Yes , you as well as the lazy Janneys . ' What nowTTea . They 're going to cut your throat with tea . And if that succeeds , then step by step everything else . ' Why tearBecause the East India Company  --  ' I know . I know . One of the poorest-run companies in the world . But it has that government monopoly . ' And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this . If you American traders want to buy tea in London , you 'll pay a heavy tax . The India Company wo n't . You 'll not be able to compete . The company will land its tea on your docks and undersell you . ' When the intricacies and injustices of this device became clear , Steed slumped in his chair , pressed his hands to his forehead and said , It looks to me as if Parliament is determined to crush the very people in the colonies upon whom England must depend . ' And with obvious frustrationhe reviewed the succession of acts already discriminating against the merchants of Maryland : the restrictions in trade , the unjustified taxes , the advantages awarded London monopolists at the expense of colonial businessmen , the preposterous shipping laws , the arrogance of the tax collectors.  |p331Have  you set forth to destroy your friends ? ' he exploded . I think we have , ' Fithian said , and with this he lowered his voice , and the conversation left mercantile affairs in which he and Steed were threatened with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the soul . What England should do right now , Simon  --  before summer  --  is say to the colonies with smiling good will , " Go your way , children . Grow strong and later on share your munificence with us . " ' Steed said nothing . The idea was so radical , so contrary to his own conclusions , that he could barely digest it . So Fithian continued , If we do that , we shall bind you to us forever . You 'll bank in London , and buy your goods there , and send your sons to Oxford . Believe me , a union like that could be a powerful force in this world . ' Do many think like your Steed asked . You would be sick to hear the idiots . They ca n't visualize any future different from the past . I argue the future of Atlantic trade and they hear nothing . This fellow Burke argues the legal position and they do n't hear him either . ' Is no concession possibl  --  ' They 'd all be possible if men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But the substantial ones that could remake the world ? Impossible . ' So we planters will be driven back and back ? ' Yes . Because you 're visible . ' It would be fearfully wrong if Parliament continued to abuse us merchants . We 're your link to sanity . We 're loyal to a man . We love England , but we 'll not be endlessly abused . ' And so the discussion continued , the Englishman advocating separation , the colonial renewing his allegiance . It ended when Fithian said abruptly , Enough of this . You must come with me to Janney 's . ' I 've warned you . I wo n't touch it . ' But for your own sake , you must see the problem . Besides , I want to show Jane the Virginia shore . ' Is she going ? ' Of course . I want her to know you . I want her to marry you . ' You shock me . ' She 's my baby sister . A precious , wonderful child . And we 've been affiliated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it time we made the bonds closer . ' I 'm Catholic . ' We have an ample supply of Protestants in the other branches of the family . ' He tapped Steed on the chest . All of us need new blood , new ideas . And you need a wife . ' Steed started to protest , but Fithian stopped him . I sit in London and read letters from all over the world , and after a few years I build an image of the writers . And the image I have of you , Simon , is of a stolid , honest , unexciting calculator who is sometimesp332deeply moved by contemporary happenings , but dry of heart . Do n't miss life because you contemplated it only from a distance . ' The sail to the Rappahannock was a peaceful winter idyll : geese flew overhead in vast congregations and the sky was a lambent gray ; occasionallysome ship bound for Baltimore would appear through the soft haze , its nine sails barely filled , and after a while it would pass on . The weather was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bright English red , and she would apologize , I 'm sure I must look a perfect milkmaid . ' She was a witty girl , well able to participate in the learned discussions her brother conducted . I think the king should send two armies to the colonies , one to march from New York north and the other from New York south . Then we 'll see what headstrong rebels are capable of . ' She said such things to tease Simon , who was twenty-one years her senior , but she did not succeed . OYour armies , my dear Miss Fithian , would never reach either Boston or Philadelphia . We 're not children , you know . ' You 're barbarians , that 's what you are , and if we stopped our ships for even six months you 'd perish ... for lack of food ... and ideas . ' And if we stopped our ships for six months , Fithians would crumple ... for lack of money . ' We 'd be sillies , each of us , to act so stupidly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't . ' But when they reached the Janney plantation and she saw its sad condition , she was deeply agitated . They seem such fools , all of them . Oh , Guy , if only we could stay here a year or two to straighten them out ! ' Her brother pointed out that the fault lay not only with the unfortunate Janneys but with the policy-makers in London . I 'm to blame , too , for extending them credit . ' Only Simon remained untouched by the swift fall in the Janney fortunes . They 've always been inept , and now fate in the form of tenpercentinterest has overtaken them . ' It was his opinion that Fithians should foreclose , take control of the vast lands , and sell them cheaply to some better managers . We ca n't do that , ' the Englishman protested . Because if we forced Janney 's into bankruptcy , we 'd have to follow with at least nineteen others . What would be the result ? Panic in Virginia . And Fithians with more plantations than it could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Guy Fithian , spiritual and legal representative of many English businessmen , lowered his head , rubbed his chin and said , Pray . That 's what we 'll do , pray . ' For wha  --  ' Well , my first prayer has been that I could find someone like you to manage Janney 's . And the nineteen others . To tide us over the periodp333before the war starts . ' At the mention of war , Simon winced . And next I 'd pray that after the war the free colonies will honor their debts . ' Do n't speak as if war were inevitable , ' Steed said . It is , ' Fithian said quietly . And after they had inspected a batch of plantations tottering on abysses which the owners barely comprehended , Jane asked her brother , Ca n't we do something ? ' As I said before , we can pray . ' So the war I spoke of in jest is to be a realit  --  ' I think so , ' her brother said . The visits to the grand plantations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rivers ; slaves would be waiting at the wharves to catch the lines ; ahead would stretch the impeccable lawn ; off to one side would stand the slave quarters ; and in the midst of all would rise the mortgaged mansion , sometimes with columns gleaming in the wintry sun . The reception was invariably generous , with fine drinks and small talk of London , but in the eyes of the owners there would be a quiet terror in the presence of this factor who owned the place . Guy Fithian was not a destroyer ; he was there to see if some reign of reason could be installed to save both the ostensible owners and himself , but there was never a rational plan . The slaves have to be fed , Mr. Fithian . Tobacco is sure to recover . We do n't know how to raise corn or wheat . There 's been some talk of growing apples , but only for cider . And each month our debts seem to grow heavier . ' Yet it was these good people , so sorely abused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ king . There will never be rebellion here . In Richmond and Williamsburg there has been talk . Jefferson is n't reliable and Patrick Henry is a born troublemaker of no substance whatever . No , sir , Virginia stands fast with the king . ' That 's more than I would do , ' Fithian told Steed as they prepared for the sail back to Devon . Steed did not respond , and Fithian , in an abrupt change of subject , asked , And what of Jan  --  ' In these uncertain times ... ' That 's when you must get your personal affairs in order . Do you intend marrying he  --  ' Good heavens ! ' Simon , for the past six weeks we 've been visiting people unable to make decisions . Do n't become like them in your old age . ' The mention of age was unfortunate ; it gave Simon an excuse . After all , I 'm forty-three and she 's only twenty-two . I 'm old enough  --  ' A splendid excuse , ' Guy snapped . And I can think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why notT Simon asked almost petulantly ; he did not like being ridiculed.  |p334Because  we live in an age of tension . Everything 's uncertain , and at such times wise men attend to basics ... like marriage . ' Steed said , I 'll think about it on the sail home . ' And when the island loomed far to the east , hiding in river mists , Guy called him to the rear of the sloop and asked , What 's the decision ? ' and Steed said hesitantly , I might as well , ' and Guy shouted , Jane , come here ! ' and when she joined them , red-cheeked and lively , her brother said , Simon wants to marry you , ' and she kissed Steed and poked him in the ribs and said , You did n't have to propose . I was going to do it when we reached the island . ' Steed was relieved that a major decision had been reached so painlessly ; the more he had seen of Jane in the Virginia mansions the more he had grown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young woman , with a strong mind and a lively interest in the Fithian enterprises . He was sure that she could have married a younger man  --  several in Virginia had seemed eager to propose  --  and was flattered that she had chosen him . You could have brought order into any of those plantations , ' he told her as they walked up the path from the wharf . I want you to manage this one . ' But in obedience to some deep sense of propriety she said , I did n't come to manage . I came to love . ' But beyond such practical considerations , which were English in nature , Steed also felt drawn to Jane sexually , and was neither reluctant nor embarrassed to express this longing , a fact he attributed to his French inheritance . Jane became increasingly desirable when they went to bed in the large square room once occupied in bitter loneliness by Rosalind Janney Steed , and one night when low flames spiraled in the bedroom fireplace she said , You thought your life had ended , did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to begin , ' and she laughed . While Simon Steed had been absent in Virginia , conducting his reticent courtship , Teach Turlock fumed in jail , and to every prisoner who shared his cell he spoke veiled treason  --  Maybe we got to drive the fat rector out of Maryland . This land stealing . ' He suggested that judges were thieves , too , and whenever any Englishman was mentioned , even the king , he spoke harshly . Some of his fellow prisoners , aware of the way his thoughts were tending , tried to mollify him by arguing against his excesses , but he rejected their counsel . The time is comin ' ... ' he said , and told those close to him that when he got out of jail , Englishmen had better watch out . The jailer got a taste of his hardening attitude when papers were delivered for Turlock to sign ; they transferred title to eighty acres to the Rector of Wrentham , but when Teach understood this he refused to make his mark  --  No rector takes my land . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the jailer said patiently as the clerk nodded . To hell with the court . ' The two officials gasped , for such language was not used in Patamoke . The law in such cases was precise : for speaking disrespectfully of any court , imprisonment ; for a second offense , branding the tongue with a flaming iron ; for a third offense , hanging . Say nothing of his blasphemy to the justices , ' the jailer pleaded when he and the clerk were alone . He 's a crazy man who loves his land . ' But of course the justices had to be told that Turlock had refused to sign , and they became angry . Two appeared in prison to warn him of the jeopardy in which he was placing himself , but he sat grim-lipped and dirty , his hands tucked beneath his bottom lest he be tempted to take the quill . We can prolong your sentence . Or take your sloop , ' they warned . But he was obdurate , and neither cajolery nor threats induced him to accept the pen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ informed that his sentence had been doubled ; he must remain in jail till April . He began to laugh at the justices , at the rector and at himself . He realized that things had gone sadly wrong and there was n't much he could do about it . At this point he could have been saved from rebellion ; a single conciliatory gesture would have mollified him . Instead his wife visited the jail with news that the surveyors had marked off the eighty acres  --  Not swampy land toward the creek . Best land . With the big trees . ' Surprisingly , he did not rage or become abusive . After his wife left he merely sat on his stool , benumbed , churning inwardly , so that one of the prisoners said , When they take a piece of his land they take a piece of his guts . ' When two justices appeared , accompanied by the constable , bearing documents for him to sign , he allowed them to pinion him , and hold his right arm , and force his fingers to draw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But later , when the justices reviewed all that had happened , they remembered that during the enforced signing Turlock had studied with animal fierceness the two documents  --  He could n't read but he was memorizing how the papers looked . ' On April 6 , 1773 , he was released and on April 7 the rectory at Wrentham was ransacked . At first the fat clergyman could not ascertain what had been stolen , for his candlesticks and silverware seemed to be intact , and it was several days before he realized that his title to the eighty acres at the marsh was missing ; when he was satisfied that this was the case , he summoned his slaves and directed them to get him to Patamoke as expeditiously as possible . Huffing and puffing , he informed the justices that Turlock 's title had been stolen , and when the justices said , We 'll have the clerk draw you a copy , ' they found that theirs was gone too . It was Turlock ! ' the clerk remembered . He was here the day af/ter he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had signed . ' You know he could n't read . ' I forgot . I was called away ... ' His voice trailed off as he tried to recall that day , and then he understood the trick that had been played on him . It was Mrs. Turlock ! She came to the other door . Asked if her husband was here . ' And you did n't ascertain whether the deed was returned to the filesT Who steals deeds ? ' Obviously Turlock did , so the justices ordered duplicates to be drawn , but when the constable went to the marshes to inform Teach that the court had fined him twenty additional acres for burglary , and that these must be added to the rector 's holding , he flew into a rage so violent that any prospect of getting him to mark the transfer was futile . I was lucky to escape with my life , ' the constable reported , so the justices took it upon themselves to sign the deed , and Turlock was cheated of another portion of his land . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the end of her days : her back was hogged ; her sails were torn ; her bottom was riddled with worm ; but Turlock had learned to sail her with surprising skill and had even taken her to Barbados for contraband rum and to Sal Tortuga for salt . The sloop merited a crew of ten , but often she sailed with only two , for Turlock could stay awake for days on end , or mostly awake , keeping his old wreck afloat . On his present trip he carried a crew of eighteen , for he had in mind much more than a smuggling trip to Barbados . At night he slipped out of the marsh , down past Devon and into the broad reaches of the Chesapeake , where he proposed to stay for some time . A vessel of quite different character was following the same plan . Lieutenant Copperdam , of His Majesty 's Royal Navy , had for some months been dominating the Massachusetts coast and had apprehended various American craft attempting to evade customs . It was his habit to board the vessel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to London in chains . This high-handed behavior had so infuriated the citizens of Massachusetts that Copperdam had decided to test his fortune in the Chesapeake . The first colonial vessel he spied was a broken-down , hog-backed sloop limping along with every sign of running contraband . At first Copperdamconsidered letting her pass , for in that condition it could not be carrying much , but since there was nothing else on the horizon , he moved in for an easy capture . However , as he closed in on the derelict , its sides opened suddenly and six cannon flashed out . Fire was withheld , and Copperdam saw to his astonishment that the enemy intended boarding and fighting hand-tohand . Too late he tried to pull away , but in doing so , ran aground ,  |p337whereu|pon  the shallow-drafted sloop came close and put its men aboard . And then a miracle happened ! Instead of capturing the English vessel and arresting its crew , the invaders merely ransacked it for anything of value and sailed boisterously out into the Atlantic . Lieutenant Copperdam , in reporting his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , It was like wrestling a porcupine barehanded . They said she carried a crew of only eighteen . Seemed more like eight hundred . ' When they asked about her captain , he said , Bearded , barefooted , filthy , and never said a word . ' And as he was reporting , another English ship came into New York with a similar tale . A black sloop which seemed about to sink hailed us , emptied our hold and sailed away . ' Was the captain barefooted , heavy bear  --  ' The same . ' When this description circulated about the Chesapeake , knowing sailorsrealized that Teach Turlock had declared private war against the English , and they speculated on how soon that war would become general . Plantation owners , appalled at the possibility of an open breach with England , growled , What 's the damn fool done ? Issue his own letters of marque and reprisal ? He ought to be hanged . ' But one dark night the black sloop came creeping into the Choptank , and before dawn the local watermen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hidden her within the marsh . Turlock was their champion . As the year 1773 drew to a close , Levin Paxmore worked fourteen and fifteen hours a day . The transom of the building vessel had already been carved and painted  --  Whisper  --  and the keelson had been fastened to the keel . The two huge masts had been shaped  --  square to octagon to circle  --  and the steps into which they would ultimately be fitted had been carpentered . But the planking was far behind schedule . The reason was an old one : cutting pine boards to the right thickness , shaping them to the intricate flow of the schooner 's silhouette , and matching a larboard plank to one already cut for the starboard were both time-consuming and difficult . There was a limit to what sawyers could do in a day , and a ship of this size expended timber at a rate of something like six times that of the smaller boats Paxmore had been accustomed to build . And yet , every new scrap of information which filtered in to Patamoke confirmed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quickly . As Paxmore told his wife , The omens are frightening . Yesterdayan English warship came all the way to Patamoke . Pestering me to learn if it was one of ours that had assaulted Lieutenant Copperdam ! Wanting to know why I was building the Whisper . Taking notes on everything . '  |p338What  does thee think will happen ? ' Ellen asked . My mind is blank . I work from day to day . ' He paused , then added , The only thing I 'm sure of is that when I finish this one , another will be needed . ' Again he hesitated . What I 've done is , send my men into the forest . They 've cut three more keels and six more masts , and now I 'm looking beyond those to the others that must follow . ' Does thee see war ? ' Paxmore looked about the kitchen to assure himself that none of the children were listening , then said , I see confusion . ' Then why are so many vessels neede  --  ' I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's often in such times that the good work of the Lord is done . ' No ! ' he cried , leaving his chair and walking about the room , waving his hands as if to prevent her from saying what he knew she was determined to say . I can not wrestle with thy concerns this night . ' Levin , the time is at hand . God projects us into difficult times so that we may bear His testimony . ' She spoke with such sweet persistence , and with such logic , that he surrendered . Falling into a chair beside her , he asked , What nowTLast year in Patamoke Meeting the motion failed by only thirteen voices . At the Baltimore Yearly Meeting it failed by less than a hundred . It 's an obligation that God puts upon us to see this thing finished . ' I wo n't propose it . ' Levin , I 've proposed it three times . People expect me to . But if thee rises this time , it will be fresh ... a new voice ... thy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 'm too tired . I work all day at the yard , all night at my plans . Arguing with thee puts a knot in my stomach . ' But , Levin , the time has come . A great drum beats out the schedule and we must move forward ... ' Thee sounds quite militaristic . ' She ignored this , and said , When Ruth Brinton demanded that EdwardPaxmore manumit his slaves , he protested that doing so would ruin his business . It had the opposite effect . When Thomas Stavin set his free , his neighbors predicted he would go bankrupt . Now he owns twice the land . ' I can not prescribe for others . ' That 's what testimony is , ' Ellen said with profound conviction . I do not testify in order to shame my neighbors . I testify because God will allow me to do no other . It is wrong for Quakers to own slaves . It is wrong to keep Negroes in ignorance . It is wrong to separate families . It is wrong to buy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this movement , then thee condones wrong . ' I will not do thy work in meeting , ' he said , and when Ellen continued pestering him he stomped from the house and sought refuge at thep339boatyard , where he could grapple with problems that had a specific solution . He remained there for several hours , inspecting with approval the massive schooner that was taking final shape , and as he saw her looming from the shadows , he projected her into the water , two masts erect , and it occurred to him that if speed was the principal requirement , it could be assured by quitting the rigorous custom of rigging every schooner with large triangular fore-and-aft sails and substituting a much more subtle design : Gaff-rig the fore-and-afts so that the top of each mast becomes available for a pair of square-rigged sails , and add another jib forward . With such a mix ... With a dowel he sketched on the floor such a rigging , and it looked fine , but when he imagined himself in the bowels of a schooner so rigged , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ghostly sails , shifting them to unseen spars : I want this schooner to be able to maneuver in whatever wind , and for that there 's nothing beats the square sail . They can halt a ship in midflight . Or even back it up . But I also want to sail close to the wind , and for that we must have bigger fore-and-afts . On and on he went , investigating in the abstract the properties of sail , but the more rationally he thought , the tighter became the knot in his stomach , until at last he shivered in the night , so oppressive were the problems besetting him . Suddenly he cried aloud , I will not testify in meeting , ' but even as he uttered these evasive words he had to acknowledge that Ellen 's harassmentabout slavery was not the cause of his moral confusion . That sprang , curiously enough , from his speculations about rigging , and it was a perplexity that could plague only a Quaker : Speed and maneuverability ! No man would require both if he were merely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need only if he intended using his vessel in war . What I 'm building is a ship of war . Overcome by this realization , he fell on his knees , clasped his hands and began to pray : I 'm not building ships of war . I 'm not building platforms for cannon . Almighty God , I 'm a poor man trying to live with my neighbors in accordance with Thy law . Exert Thy full power to keep us at peace . He prayed for a long time , asking guidance as to what he must do with this schooner , and the three others coming in its train . He would not build for war , and yet every improvement he had made on the Whisper made her more war-worthy . He was on his knees when the door to the big shed opened , admitting a man who seemed to be carrying an armful of tools . Had he been headed the other way , Paxmore would have suspected him of stealing them , but obviously he was bringing them back  --  and this was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closer , and saw to his surprise that it was Gideon Hull , one of his best workmen and a Quaker to be trusted ; he was indeed carrying a heavy armload of shipbuilding tools . What 's thee doing , Gideon ? ' he asked in a quiet voice.  |p340The  workman dropped the tools , whipped around in dismay and saw Paxmore kneeling in the shadows . Neither man spoke , so Paxmore began picking up the tools . What were they for , Gideo  --  ' I was bringing them back . ' I would have loaned them , if thee had asked . ' Not for my need , Levin . ' Whose then ? ' Hull stood mute . He knew that if he said one word , the whole story would unravel , and this he did not want , for it involved others . But Pvin Paxmore , like his wife , was persistent , and after many questions , Hull was worn down . It 's Teach Turlock . He 's back in the marsh with a cannonball through his side . We slipped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mott . ' Paxmore was shocked . Three of his best men involved in aid to an outlaw ! Realizing the legal dangers involved in such criminal behavior , he was about to berate Hull when it occurred to him that he was at least as guilty and perhaps more so : In this yard we 're building ships for war . Our acts are treasonous , and helping a pirate mend his sloop is the least of our wrongdoings . Now Hull was bragging . Everyone knows it was Turlock who did in Copperdam . He 's already sold two cargoes of captured goods in Balti-more . ' How did he get a cannonball through his strakesTHull refused to divulge additional details , and Paxmore judged it best not to press the point . Did thee patch him ? ' He 's headed for the Chesapeake right now , ' Hull said with grim satisfaction . I 'll stow these . ' And without further comment he replaced the valuable tools , bowed to Paxmore and left the shed . Paxmore remained till dawn , deeply agitated by Hull 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trees waiting to be hewn into keels , and he recalled the dictum of his forebears : A Paxmore ship keeps an unsulliedkeel . The vessels he had built had all contained such keels , heavy and true and unpenetrated , and this had accounted for the fact that they had not become hog-backed or old before their years . But the keel of his personal life was far from steady ; his ship was generating a high degree of sway . On the slavery issue , he knew that his wife was right and that the time had come for Quakers to announce forthrightly that the ownership of slaves disqualified a man or woman from membership in the society , but he also knew that one man could do only so much , and his job was building schooners against the impendingcrisis . But in doing this he tacitly approved the warfare which he saw as both deplorable and inescapable . Patriots tended to be irresponsible people like Teach Turlock ; they sought to inflame the populace to actsp341that would be regretted . Honest men like Steed and Levin Paxmore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But on this night he had discovered how easily one could be tricked into aiding rebellion , and he was confused . He ended his long vigil with one more prayer : Almighty God , keep these colonies on an even keel . The precarious balance was shattered during the balmy spring of 1774 . Guy Fithian , with the best intentions and a desire for commercial gain , sent his brother-in-law Simon this enthusiastic letter : Light at last in the darkness ! As I told you when we visited Virginia , I have been distressed by the action of Parliament in granting a tea monopoly to the East India Company . Things were managed poorly by the Company and to the disadvantage of honest traders like ourselves . I am glad to report that I have found a way to circumvent the Company 's monopoly , so that you will now be able to sell tea in your part of Maryland with a tax much lower than before and with considerable profit to both you and me . I have therefore taken the liberty of loading your old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the choicest leaf . Since your snow is not a fast ship , it will doubtless arrive after these letters , but I am sure you will have no trouble in disposing of her cargo at these attractive prices . Steed did not anticipate any trouble in the sale of his unordered cargo : Fithians would send leaves of first-rate quality ; it was eagerly wanted by his customers ; and as London pointed out , under the new system it actually cost less than tea imported from Holland or France . But in the interval before its arrival he began to encounter difficulties at home . Jane Steed was proving to be even more delightful a wife than he had anticipated ; she was a fascinating companion , a delightful hostess . Whateverdress fell into her hands she improved , and her three slaves seemed to enjoy sewing her old clothes into new patterns , or tricking them out1 with bits of lace and satin . She was also innovative in kitchen affairs , dressing duck and venison in rich new ways , and finding delicious uses for hominy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to advantage . Devon had never known better meals than the ones she supervised , and when visitors from Europe spent a month or so at Rosalind 's Revengethey always complimented the Steeds on the excellence of their table . Simon 's the one to thank , ' Jane said modestly . He lived in France , you know , and learned the secrets of good cooking . ' This was an amusing deception ; Simon shared the honest American attitude toward food  --  Have plenty and cook it till it 's black . '  |p342In  the early days of their acquaintance Jane had sometimes ridiculed her future husband 's colonial pretentions at learning ; after she had lived with him for a while she found that he actually did read five languages : English , French , German , Latin and Greek . His library did include the best available books in each of those languages , and all had been studied . His knowledge was extraordinary and she was pleased to see that it had not made him a radical ; in all judgments he was conservative , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supported her . But Jane had become increasingly distressed by one fact which had not impressed itself upon her during the brief days of their courtship : Simon was in trade . He had stores in Patamoke , Edentown , Oxford and St. Michaels . He and his brothers had actually worked in these stores , serving the general public , and nephews of the family now served in them , mastering the skills which had kept the family prosperous for more than a century and a half . Not only did the Steeds have stores , but they also offered for general sale the handiwork of their slaves . The Steed Negroes made barrels , as blacks did on all plantations , but when they had made enough for the family 's use , they went on making them , and young Steed managers went about the Chesapeake peddling them . They sold lumber , too , and extra cloth woven by the Devon slaves . What was even more demeaning , on two different occasions Simon had loaded one of his ships to the gunwales , sailed her to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who in one swoop gained possession of some hogsheads of tobacco , some naval stores much needed in the islands , and a sound Paxmore-built ship . On the first of these unusual deals Steed had gained a thousand pounds , paid in Spanish coins , and on the second , a thousand five . Jane found such dealings distasteful . Gentlemen did not engage in trade ; they left the running of shops and the haggling over prices of individual items to folk of lesser category . In fact , a true gentleman rarely carried money on his person and never discussed it with others . The actual handling of money  --  the passing of coins from one person to another  --  was contaminating , and she found it abhorrent that her husband was engaged in this dirty business . Fithians does nothing else , ' Simon protested one day . Ah , but we do it in general , never the specific . ' I do n't see the difference , ' Steed said . You would if you 'd been educated in England . Trade is repulsive . Gentlemen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On this point she was obdurate , and Steed discovered that to the English gentry the retail sale of a single item was gauche , while the wholesale movement of a thousand such items was acceptable . It comes down to one simple question , ' his wife said . Do you meanly bow andp343scrape to everyone who has a shilling , or do you handle your business affairs like a gentleman ... with yearly accounting in a dignified manne  --  ' Is that what your brother does ? ' Simon asked . Of course . I doubt if he 's ever handled money in his life . There are books and yearly accountings and it 's all settled by clerks who write letters . ' Steed laughed . When we were in Virginia , did n't you see that those fine people were in danger of losing their plantations because they knew nothing of business ? And that we Steeds have saved ours because we did ? We know how to run stores , and work slaves to a profit . Every one of my nephews knows how to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Do n't you feel '  --  she groped for a word  --  dirty ? Does n't this storekeepingmake you feel degrade  --  ' Not when it keeps us solvent . And able to buy the books we want . ' If , as Jane charged , she was besmirched by the dirty fingers of trade , ' she had to admit that the trade was not parochial . To be sure , the family fortunes rested upon the Eastern Shore emporiums and collateral manufacturingoperations , but the levels of profit were determined by exports to Europe : tobacco , naval stores and timber to England ; fish , flour and meat to other countries . It was not unusual for a merchant ship to arrive in the Chesapeake with commercial documents from as many as fifty different European cities inquiring about shipments of Steed materials . In Great Britain the letters might have come from towns like Oxford , Cambridge , Edinburgh ; in Spain , from cities such as Barcelona , Cadiz , Seville ; in Portugal , from Lisbon or the salt town St. Ubes ; in Belgium @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , from Amsterdam , Utrecht , Haarlem ; and in France , because of Simon 's study there , from any of thirty-four cities like Bergerac , Dunkirk , Metz , Besancon and , especially , Nantes . To work on Devon Island in 1774 was to be in contact with the most sophisticated centers of Europe . But in the spring of that year one commercial event superseded all others : the arrival at the mouth of the Chesapeake of the creaking , waterlogged old snow Fair Rosalind , laden with packets of tea which had evaded the normal tax in London . All that was required to make this transaction legal was the payment of a small token tax designated by Parliament to act as proof that the colonies were still subservient to it . In Boston in the preceding autumn there had been minor trouble over this petty tax , and one consignment of tea had actually been thrown into the harbor , but those tempers had subsided and Marylanders loyal to the king trusted that there would be no trouble in their colony . In fact , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this cheap tea . The justices expressed strong pro-British sentimentsand told him , High time the mother country exerted her authority . You did a good job , Steed , bringing in this tea . '  |p344The  Paxmores were disturbed . They loved their tea , and since they drank nothing stronger , had felt deprived when denied it . But like Quakersin general , they brooded about potential consequences of even the most transparent act , and this tax on tea was far more complicated than that . I want the tea , ' Levin Paxmore said , but to be forced to pay a tax about which I was not consulted goes against the grain of my republican principles . ' He concluded that he should pay the tax , drink the tea and tremble over what might happen next . I know what Steed will do . I know what we will do . But who can predict what the Turlocks might doTWho , indeed ? Since that fateful day in 1765 when Parliament arbitrarilyimposed a Stamp Act requiring a trivial fee on commercial and legal paper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him had sensed intuitively that Britain was trying to place its collar upon the colonists , and he resisted like an untamed dog . He had never used one of the items taxed  --  how could he , being illiterate ?  --  but he had known danger when it appeared  --  It ai n't right . ' He had continued to resist each subsequent act of Parliament which infringed his freedom , for he saw with primitive logic that if London succeeded with the tea , it would transfer its strategy to other areas until all rights were strangled . Teach could not have expressed even one of his conclusions in a reasoned sentence , but his crafty , analytic mind recognized tyranny in whatever subtle form it took . The rector , the king alike . He steals my land . He steals my taxes . Together they steal my freedom . ' He represented the thinking of most colonists , and now when he sailed his black schooner boldly into the Choptank they applauded , for he was their spiritual champion even though his lack of education prevented him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right to her berth at Patamoke ; he did not enter the inner harbor , but anchored in the Choptank , where he could watch the celebration on shore as the tea-ship docked , delivered its papers to the authorities , and welcomed aboard the English tax collector , who inspected the tea , calculated its value and submitted a bill to Simon Steed as the consignee . Only when the tax was paid , and the submission to England legalized , did Turlock row ashore . His arrival caused a commotion , for his daring behavior at sea had elevated him to the rank of hero , but he did not look the part . He was forty-two years old , extremely thin , bearded , barefooted , dressed in two rough garments which fitted him poorly , and quite dirty from months at sea . He wore no belt , but the rope that held up his trousers also held two pistols , and when he slouched along , these moved awkwardly , bangingagainst his raw hipbones . He wore no hat , but since he was taller titan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rough kind of leadership . Where 's Steed ? ' he asked as soon as he reached the customs office.  |p345He  went to his store .

Steed was not visible . Where is heT Turlock asked , and the young Steed nephew who was managing the place indicated a room in the rear . Hullo , Simon . ' Turlock ! Are n't you brave , coming into portTThe tea . ' What about itTYou paid the taxiAs required . ' Do n't sell it . ' But it 's paid for . People want it . ' Simon , do n't sell it . ' They talked in this manner for some time : a plea from Turlock not to sell , a reply from Steed that it was a normal business transaction . They got nowhere , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employees sought to unload the tea and take it to the family warehouse , Turlock 's sailors prevented them . There was a scuffle , nothing much , and the young Steed manager ran to the wharf , calling upon Fair Rosalind 's crew to drive off the troublemakers , but when the crew moved forward to help unload the tea , the gaunt figure of Teach Turlock interposed . Do n't touch , ' he said quietly . He made no move toward his guns . He merely stood barefooted at the wharf-end of the gangplank and advised the Steed sailors to drop their bundles of tea and withdraw . They did . All that day Turlock stood guard , and at dusk a rowboat from the black sloop came ashore with nine more of his sailors , who positioned themselves about the gangplank . The next two days saw increased tension . The justices came to the wharf and warned Turlock that he must not interfere with the unloading of a cargo properly paid for and properly taxed , but the resolute captain merely said , No tea . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the constable 's single deputy could in no way oppose the will of these brigands , but if the general public could be mobilized , the freebooters could be disciplined and the tea could be landed . So the justices appealed to the people of Patamoke  --  and a strange thing happened . The people listened respectfully , weighed what the learned men had to say  --  and concluded that they , were wrong and Turlock was right . One man reminded the crowd , They took his land and he takes their tea . ' We 're not talking about land , ' the justices complained . We 're talking about tea . '  |p346Now  Turlock spoke . No tea . No tax . Soon we lose everything . ' The parliamentary complexities were beyond the understanding of common people , but they grasped the danger in this insidious tax , and the attemptsof the justices to enlist them in opposition to Turlock failed . He did not gloat at their defeat . Instead he walked quietly to the Steed store and there initiated a discussion which was to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Neither Steed nor Turlock allowed the argument to become heated , and such threats as were made were couched in the subdued terms used by two long-time adversaries striving to reach a sensible solution to their impasse . The tea will be landed , ' Steed warned . Soldiers will be sent from Annapolis . ' They 'll find no tea . ' Why notTWe talk today . We talk tomorrow . Tomorrow night we burn your snow . ' That 's destruction ! ' It 's old . Seventy years . All patches . ' You 'd burn the Rosalind ? ' Simon , it 's war . In Barbados , men from Massachusetts told me . ' England will crush us . Teach , if you burn my snow , England will drive you from the seas . ' For the first time in their discussions Turlock smiled , a grimy , hairy , self-confident smile . Four times now he had gone up against the English in naval actions , and while it was true that on three of those occasions they had forced him to run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself were at sea , there would be no chance of eliminatingthem all . He did not try to rebut Steed 's arguments ; he smiled . And in that quiet arrogance he conveyed a message to the merchant that no words could have achieved . Steed said , You think war is inevitabl  --  ' Mmmm . ' You think we can wi  --  ' Mmmm . ' You think the seas can be kept openT Mmmm . ' You think Boston is going to stand fir  --  ' Mmmm . ' Again and again these two men , who had operated together only as co-defendants in the tithe case , reviewed the situation , and after two hours had passed , Steed said , I 'd like to bring Paxmore in , ' and Turlock nodded . So the Quaker was sent for , and he appeared , gray and cautious . Turlock thinks there 's bound to be war , ' Steed said . Anxiety showed in Paxmore 's face , and he said , Oh , I hope not . ' You afraid ? ' Turlock growled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But what if we do n't have actual war ? ' Steed asked . Just-irritations . Can we keep the sea lanes open ? ' Now Paxmore was obligated to speak as a proud shipbuilder . The Whisper will not be taken . Her speed will astonish. '  |p347When  will she be ready ? ' ' Three weeks . ' And you 'll start on the others ? ' ' I already have . ' And with this admission Paxmore knew that he had committed himself to war . He wiped his forehead . The three men sat in the small office , and no one spoke . Flies buzzed and Turlock followed their flight from window to door to ceiling , waiting for the frightened leaders to make sensible comment . Finally Steed asked , Paxmore , if war does come , can we win ? ' No . ' But you seem resigned to have it comerEngland 'll win , but she 'll learn that she must treat us better . ' Exactly how I feel , ' Steed cried . We 'll have war . Turlock will see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ win . We might gain some minor concessions . ' We 'll win , ' Turlock said with great force . Howl the other two asked . By holding on . Tomorrow night we start . We burn the Rosalind . ' You whatT Paxmore cried . Turlock rose to his full height and looked serenely at his two frightenedneighbors . When we stood in court we knew this would happen . Build your schooners , Levin . Simon , you arm them . This is war . Tomorrownight it reaches Patamoke . ' He turned and left . Paxmore , shaken by the possibility that the snow might be intentionallyburned , asked , Did he mean it ? ' He did . It 's a symbolic act , and I shall make no move to stop it . ' He allowed time for this to register , then said , And neither shall you , Levin . We sail to Peace Cliff ... now ... to look for spars . ' And to protect himself , he announced to various persons in the store that he and Paxmorewere headed for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for tall trees . They were on the porch of the telescope house , watching night shadows fall across the river , when the sky behind them brightened , with flickers of reddish light darting upward from the eastern horizon . Paxmorebowed his head in silent prayer , but Steed watched the flickering shoots until they died . We 've started something of magnitude , ' he said , but Paxmore , terrifiedat the consequences , remained silent . It was characteristic of the Steeds of Devon that once they settled upon a course , they maintained it until a conclusion was reached , and in the agitated weeks following the burning of the tea , Simon hardened his thinking about the threat of war . I shall always remain loyal to the king , ' he told his wife . I should hope so , ' she said , as if there were no alternative.  |p348But  if Parliament persists in transgressing our natural rights ... ' What natural rights do colonials haverYou sound like the member of Parliament who said , " In London the thinking head , in America @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! The purpose of a colony is to provide wealth to the homeland , and I think it shameful the way you allowed a filthy pirate to burn your tea . ' She had no words strong enough to condemn his supine surrender . The people refused the tea . ' They 'd have taken it if you 'd shown any fight . ' She railed at the pusillanimity of the authorities and said that three English soldiers in uniform could have stopped the whole affair . What 's more , ' she added , I think that Turlock told you about the burning in advance . So that you and that sickly Paxmore could scuttle out . ' Ignoring this clever deduction , he said , My real irritation stems from the fact that the colonies are not being used properly . The only possible justification for England 's owning a colony in a new land is to experiment here with methods that ca n't be introduced in the home country . ' You do talk the greatest nonsense , Simon . ' I want to keep Maryland a part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to our unique development . ' Maryland develops as England develops , and that 's that . Your job is to serve the king . ' An opportunity to serve arose in the summer of 1774 , when a committeeof eleven leading citizens of Patamoke and surrounding territories convened to discuss events occurring at scattered points throughout the colonies . Two of the members had some time earlier volunteered to serve as local reporters to the Maryland Committee of Correspondence , whose job it was to maintain contact with committees of like intention in other regions . Inflammatory documents from Boston had been forwarded to South Carolina , and the correspondents in that state reported how they , too , had resisted the importation of tea . In July the Patamoke committee sent a deputation to Devon to discuss the possibility of Steed 's chairing a meeting that would review the situation in the colonies and draft a statement of local intention . Two boats sailed into the creek , and when the somber men came up the brick-lined path to the big house , Jane Steed was stiffly courteous . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and knew them by name , but now she could guess at their purpose and it repelled her . Come in , gentlemen , ' she said with obvious reserve . Place your hats on the table . My husband will join you shortly . ' The men were pleased at another chance to see the leading mansion of their district and commented idly on the fine decorations . Jane stayed with them briefly , then excused herself , for she wanted no part in thisp349seditious gathering , but when her husband appeared , he got right to the heart of the matter . I 'm sure you have n't come so far on trivial affairs . ' We have not , ' the leader said , and he asked the two correspondents to outline the present condition of the colonies . In Massachusetts , endless problems with the governor . In South Carolina , near-rebellion . In New York , confusion . And in Virginia . . . ' Here one of the writers paused , dropped his pompous style and said , Gentlemen , we can thank God for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are they doing ? ' Writing . Arguing . Defending all of us with their cogency . ' WhoTJefferson .. . I have little regard for him , ' Steed said . Madison , Wythe . ' Has Byrd spoke  --  ' He has not . He seems afraid . ' That bodes ill . The Byrds are the best of the lot . ' And the most timorous . ' So what do you propose for the Eastern Shor  --  ' For the entire shore , nothing . For Patamoke , everything . ' And these quiet , conservative businessmen , most of them self-taught , expressed their fears and hopes . Events were deteriorating . As in New York , all was confusion . The colonies were like a rudderless ship wallowingin the troughs , and it was incumbent upon men of good will to state their positions . This the men of Patamoke were prepared to do . We shall convene a meeting in the courthouse , Thursday instant , ' one of the merchants said . We think you should preside , Simon , and that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter , ' Steed said . If we sign and publish a document that ... ' We run risks , ' the spokesman said . But , ' one of the correspondents interrupted , by Thursday night we could have our resolutions flying to all the colonies . Men in New Hampshirewould know where we stand , and in Georgia , too . ' Steed thought : He wants to dispatch letters because his job is to dispatch letters . Aloud he said , We will be placing our necks on the chopping block , you know that . ' The chairman caught the significance of Steed 's use of we and our . Then you will be with usT'I will . ' Thank God . We did not want to move without you . ' But when the eleven patriots had gone , fortified perhaps by Steed 's acceptance but frightened for sure by his mention of the chopping block , Jane demanded to know what had taken place , and when Simon told her ,  |p350she  was furious . What are you doing , you pitiful little tradesmen ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought of it that way , ' Steed said quietly . You 'd better ! A gang of foolish , untraveled boors and clods from Patamoke are going to tell the King of England what to do ? Is that what you propose ? ' I had n't expressed it that way . ' How do you express treason ? ' Simon pondered this question for some moments , then said , I 'd rather imagined that a group of men on the scene wanted to advise Parliament of certain facts which might otherwise be overlooked . ' What presumption ! ' Jane cried . You ! You are going to advise Parlia-ment ! ' If I lived in England , I would be in Parliament . There is no one in Parliament , Jane , who even approaches my knowledge of Maryland . ' That 's sheer vanity , Simon . ' Let me express it another way . Every one of those eleven men who met here knows more about what to do in Maryland than any member of Parliament . ' John Digges ! He collects muskrat skins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tan them , and sell them , and what 's good for others like himself . ' Simon , if you presume to meet with those men and send insulting resolutions to the king , I would expect soldiers to come here and arrest you and maybe hang you . ' I run the risk of just that , ' Steed said , but no amount of railing altered his decision . On Thursday morning he asked two slaves to sail him to Patamoke , where he landed at noon . After reporting at the store to satisfy himself that no tea was on the shelves , he repaired to the boatyard , where Paxmore had the Whisper almost ready to launch ; it was a handsome vessel , and the thin lines of caulking along the bottom formed beautiful patterns . But when Steed asked if Paxmore proposed to join the meeting at the courthouse , the latter said firmly , No . Thee is heading for waters in which I can not follow . ' I 'd like to have your signature , ' Steed said . My wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not one for signing petitions . I do n't know where all this is going to lead . ' You heard Turlock . It leads to war . And war leads to nothing . But we 're on a course that can not be altered . ' Paxmore repeated that he would not participate in the meeting , but he surprised Steed by showing him three keels chopped out of oak and a pile of spars waiting along the edge of the shed . On the day the Whisper was launched , a new schooner would be started.  |p351Fourteen  men convened . Steed did not speak ; he sat severely alone on the dais , and when the clerk started to take down what the various speakers said , he shook his head firmly and the writing stopped ; he explained that he wanted no permanent record of who made which proposals , lest at some future date it be used nefariously . The assembly was as ridiculous as Jane had predicted : a group of partially educated farmers and petty tradesmen presuming to advise a king , but they wrestled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would form one of America 's significant summaries of grievances . When the speeches ended , Steed rose and reminded the committee , We are here to asseverate our allegiance to the king , and to seek his understanding cooperation . I will not sign unless we include an affirmationof loyalty . ' All agreed , and when this was provided , the document was read : Alarmed at the present situation in America , and distressed by the incessant encroachments upon our liberties , we are determined not only to complain but likewise to exert our utmost endeavours to prevent the enforcement of such encroachments as deprive us of our cherished birthright as Englishmen . Motivated by the warmest zeal and loyalty to our Most Gracious Sovereign , we are determined calmly and steadily to act in concert with our fellow subjects in the colonies to pursue every legal and constitutional measure to prevent the loss or impairment of our liberties ; and to promote an ever closer union and harmony with the mother country , on which the preservationof both must finally depend . ' Thirteen men walked forward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pen was handed to the chairman , who signed boldly in the place reserved for him , Steed of Devon , and before the sun had set , the two energetic correspondentswere on the way to Annapolis with the document which they labeled The Patamoke Determination . In the early months of 1775 Teach Turlock 's private war against England came to an abrupt halt . He lost his sloop . He was drifting lazily back from Barbados with a legal cargo of sugar , salt and slaves when he was hailed by an English customs frigate whose captain wished to conduct a routine search . Since Turlock carried no contraband , he should have submitted , but he was so antagonistic to authority that he resisted . When the English captain ran out his guns , Turlock fled . In a decent vessel the waterman would have escaped , for he was much the better sailor , but his old , hog-backed sloop was in sad shape and wasp352quickly overtaken , but with dusk approaching , there was still a likelihoodthat Turlock would escape , so the frigate began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , shattering much of it and leaving the topsails flapping in the wind . This enabled the English captain to close , but instead of finding a chastened merchantman waiting to be boarded , he found a little battleshippreparing for hand-to-hand combat . Put down those guns ! ' the English captain called as the ships were about to touch , but before he could repeat the cry , shots were being exchanged and a full-scale naval engagement was under way . The English won . Three of Turlock 's sailors were killed , and when the rest had been herded aboard the frigate , the old black pirate sloop was set ablaze and Turlock , in captivity , had to watch it sink into the Atlantic , while his crew was chained for transport to London . Piracy , mutiny , firing on His Majesty 's ship , ' intoned the captain . You 'll be hanged , every one . ' But as the frigate entered the North Atlantic it was overtaken by a speedy privateer out of Boston , and now a second battle ensued , with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after the English vessel had been stripped , it was turned over to Turlock and his gang , who now had a fine London frigate in place of their hog-backed sloop , and with it they captured an English trader making for Plymouth . But when they sailed victoriously into the Chesapeake they were met by a Virginia patrol boat ; it led them to Jamestown , where their prize was confiscated by the government . They were shipped back to Patamoke , where Turlock announced , Fought two battles . Lost two ships . Wound up flat on my ass . ' For several weeks he tried to find a vessel , but although he was a hero to the mob , he was a pirate to the gentry , and it was they who were the owners . So he retired to the marsh , and was hunting squirrels one day when he happened to look across the waving grass and saw , returning from a surreptitious voyage to Jamaica , the finest schooner he had ever seen , Mr. Steed 's Whisper , long and slim and heavy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to float above the waters , and as it disappeared toward Patamoke , Turlock said , That 's my next command . ' His campaign started that day . When Simon Steed came down to the wharf to inspect his schooner , there was Teach Turlock , bowing properly and saying , Fine schooner , sir . If you let me take her out . . . profits ... profits . ' The idea was so preposterous that Steed ignored it , but when the Whisper was empty , there was Turlock suggesting , They 'd never catch me in this . ' Steed did not propose to risk his heavy investment on a barefoot rogue , but one day when he visited his Patamoke store Turlock presented himp353with a substantial reason : Soon we have war  --  real war  --  and do you think he can captain the Whisper ? ' And with his thumb he pointed toward Captain Allworthy . The question had perplexed Steed . Allworthy was a substantial man and a good sailor , but he was hardly right to command an important vessel if war threatened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and so the first seed was sown . It germinated some days later when the Whisper began loading spars to be sold in France , for as Steed watched on the wharf , Turlock sidled up to him and said quietly , Let me sail to France . Learn the waters . Then give Captain Allworthy the new one Paxmore 's building . ' The idea was so sensible that Steed hesitated for a moment and looked into Turlock 's eyes . What he saw was a dedication so powerful that on the spur of the moment he capitulated . All right . Get aboard as second mate . See what you can learn . ' When the Whisper sailed down the Choptank toward the bay , Teach Turlock was aboard , bearded and barefooted , feeling her sway , sensing her power and her problems . As they passed Devon Island he saluted and muttered , Simon Steed , you 're goin ' to be proud of what this schooner does , ' and at night he would lie in his hammock , tracing her lines from memory , recalling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was secured . And he could feel each of her movements and how she took the various waves . Most interesting was his relationship to Captain Allworthy , of whom he had spoken so poorly . He paid the man great respect , following him when possible and listening to all he had to say , for he realized that this man knew the sea . For generations , dating far back before the first words of the Bible were composed , certain men like Allworthy had attained through study and experience a sense of what a wooden ship could do . This knowledge , transmitted from one generation to the next  --  Phoenicianto Greek to Gaul to Anglo-Saxon to the herring fisherman off Newfoundland  --  constituted the lore of the sea , and when its customs were observed , the ships came through ; when they were not , the ships landed on rocks . And no captain in that unbroken succession could have explained what exactly he knew . On this voyage , Teach Turlock joined the procession . When the Whisper came home to Patamoke , he stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for he saw that Paxmore had launched the next schooner ; its masts were already in place . He said nothing , but watched like a marsh eagle as Captain Allworthy went down the plank to report to Mr. Steed , and he held his breath as the owner came aboard . Well , Mr. Turlock , are you ready ? ' I am . ' The Whisper 's yours . '  |p354You  'll hear good reports of her , ' Turlock said . But later , when he sailed a small boat out to Devon Island to discuss strategies , he ran into trouble , for Jane Fithian was disgusted that her family was placing a major schooner in the care of such a man . Look at him ! Ca n't read or write ! Barely speaks two words together . He 's the worst sort of American . ' When Simon tried to explain why Turlock was precisely the kind of man needed in these uncertain times , she said indignantly , Can you imagine him arriving in London and meeting with the captain of a proper English @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jane , my captains wo n't be going to London . ' Are you speaking more treason ? ' I 'm facing facts . Teach Turlock is the man we need . ' Then may God have mercy upon us . ' ' And on England . ' He said this with such depth of feeling that even she could see that he had reached a great fork in some imaginary road he had been traveling , and for a moment she wanted to share his experience ; instead she said , To throw Turlock into the Atlantic with an armed schooner is like throwing a lighted bomb into the bedclothes of King George . ' And the more he reflected on this remark , the more apt it seemed . But even he was not prepared for some of the things his unpredictable captain was capable of , because when the time came for sailing , Steed went aboard for a last-minute inspection , and what he saw pleased him . The sailors were content to work for a local hero like Turlock , and under his direction they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extra care , and all was shipshape , but as Steed was about to depart , satisfied that at least the traditional amenities were in order , he spied in a corner of the captain 's room a red-headed boy who could have been no more than seven . Who 's that ? ' Matt . ' Who 's he ? ' My son . ' He 's not sailing with you ? ' Got to learn sometime , ' and he told the boy , Take Mr. Steed to the gangplank , ' and the little fellow moved down the passageways with an expertness that showed he had already memorized his portion of the Whisper . The fact that Jane Steed argued with her husband about colonial behaviortoward England did not mean that their married life was either tense or unpleasant . She loved her pompous husband and considered his at/tempts at being an English gentleman amusing . He was generous and kind-hearted , and he indulged her in the petty expenditures which gave her so much pleasure . From the first she had wanted a slave who could sew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one in Annapolis . When she heard that an actual theater had been erected in that city , she wanted to cross the bay to see for herself , and he took her . And when she protested if anyone called her an American or a Marylander , insisting that she was English , he agreed : Jane 's from London . A Fithian , our factors . ' And whenever he said this , she seemed to glow and feel better , for she always thought of herself as an English gentlewoman . For his part , he loved her more than he had when they first traveled together in Virginia . Her smile was so genuine , and it irradiated her face so totally that it kept him enchanted . She was kind , and laughing ; any room she entered was illuminated , and it pleased him to see the way men inadvertently followed her with their admiring eyes . Under her care , Rosalind 's Revenge became the outstanding house on the Eastern Shore insofar as generous hospitality was concerned , and when she became visibly pregnant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his love for her increased . When I think of the years we might have been married , ' he said ruefully one day , and she answered , There was no possibility that we could have been wed a day earlier . I was n't ready . ' When he asked her how it was that a girl so charming had been free to come to America , I mean , why were n't you married already ? ' she said , From the time I was a little girl Guy told me that my fate was to come to America and marry you . He used to bring your letters home and let me read them . . . tobacco and pig iron . . . I became an expert on the Maryland plantation . ' She smoothed the apron over her protruding stomach and said , He also told me you were rich and kind . ' She reached up and drew her thumbnail down his chin . And he said that in France you had acquired perfect manners . He made you sound irresistible . So I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said simply , and she accepted this , for she could see the change that had come over him since her arrival . She knew that prior to her visit his life had been trapped in an iron routine : each day he had risen , read in the classics , written his letters to Europe , breakfasted , and gone about the business of managing a great plantation . He had assumed that this was his permanent destiny and that if he conserved the wealth of the plantation , it would pass into the hands of his nephews , who would live much as he was living . Jane 's arrival had revolutionized that staid routine . She had driven him to new occupations , such as boating for pleasure and having neighboringplantation couples in for six or seven days . Also , the orders being carried to London by the Steed captains were much different now , andp356when the fine furniture arrived the interior of Rosalind 's Revenge becameas elegant as the exterior . You launched a revolution , ' he told her affectionately one morning in February , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she startled him by saying abruptly , Do n't use that word around me . These damned colonies want nothing but revolution . ' Eager to assure her , he said that whereas Maryland might kick up its heels , it would never break away from the king . We might have arguments , ' he said quietly . And maybe even an exchange of fire . But we 'll always honor our loyalty to the king . ' She rejected this , claiming that everything the colonials were doing implied disloyalty to the king , but he reminded her that in The Patamoke Determination it was he who had insisted on the sentences reaffirming loyalty . Words ! ' she said , and the force with which she spoke made him realize that she had for some time been brooding about the actions of the colonies . Some days later Simon was handed an unsealed letter for transmission to London . It was addressed to Guy Fithian , and since it was a family custom for both Jane and Simon to add postscripts to each other 's letters to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by its contents : Life here becomes almost unbearable . The average Marylander is a peasant with no appreciation of manners and no desire to acquire any . Conversation is so boring I could scream . No politics , no fashion , no gossip , no comment on the life of a city . I crossed the bay to see what they call their theater . Sheridan , and not one person on stage could act and the violins were out of tune . I have n't had a decent piece of beef in two years , and if anyone gives me oysters again , I shall throw them in his face . Horrible food . But I could bear this if the citizens were civil , but all the whispers are of war against England and of ships clashing at sea . Simon , good man that he is , assures me that this pitiful country of his will always remain loyal to our beloved King ; but why the King should want it is beyond me . I say cut it loose and be damned . Guy , tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subdue the Scottish rebels in ' i5 and ' 45 and the French in ' 63 , and now permit these ridiculous colonials with no fleet , no army , no cities and no leadership to give us trouble ? Why does n't the King send a troop as he did with Scotland and knock these silly people about the ears ? I warn you , if these rebellious fools , and you should see the idiot Simon has put in command on one of his ships , if they take steps against the King I shall jump on the first English ship that touches here and come home till the idiots are disciplined . I am having a baby soon and will bring it , too.  |p357Soberly  , his jaw quivering , he carried the letter to his desk , lit a taper , melted the wax and sealed it , without adding the customary postscript . He placed it with the substantial pile of correspondence intended for Europe , leaving it on top so that Jane could satisfy herself that it had been posted . He said nothing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attendant , listening to her complaints about their neighbors and responding to each of her small demands . When word reached the Chesapeake of how conditions in Massachusettshad deteriorated after Lexington , with rebels continuing to fire upon the king 's men , Jane fell into a despondency from which Simon could not lure her . She began ranting openly against the drabness of Maryland life : No breeding , no sense of station . And those damnable month-long visits by plantation boors . And what I simply can not abide a day longer , the monotony of the greasy cooking . ' Steed deemed it wise not to remind her that only a month previous she had been praising Maryland cooking . Instead he did his best to placate her , but nothing offset the fact that insolent colonials had fired upon the king 's troops . Her impressions were intensified when Captain Turlock sailed into Patamoke with triumphant news about the Whisper . In a moment of thoughtlessness Simon invited him to Devon , where his crude manners and peasant gloating infuriated Jane . Turlock said , This schooner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Big ones upstairs , before the wind like a hawk . ' Enthusiastically he reported on a close brush with an English frigate and on how the Whisper had shown her heels . Did you fire on the king 's ship ? ' Jane asked . Did n't need to . ' Turlock recalled the encounter and grinned , his broken teeth showing through his beard . Matt stood aft , laughing at the Englishmen as we pulled away . ' Who 's Matt ? ' Jane asked . My son . ' How old is he ? ' Soon to be eight . ' Jane gave a little shudder and left the room . ' I think you 'd better get back to the Whisper , ' Steed said , and in some confusion the lanky captain left . He had expected dinner , but at the wharf he assured Simon , I 'm ready to sail any time , ' and they stood beside the vessel and talked over plans . Always the same problems , ' Steed said , one foot on the gunwale . No salt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Portuguese port St. Ubes has plenty of salt . ' Our ships have never sailed there . Too close to England . ' I 'd like to try St. Ubes . Big cargo , big profit . ' You willing to risk it ? ' With Whisper , yes . ' So it was agreed that Turlock would try a riskyp358passage to a new port whose salt mines were reputed to be the best after the ones in Poland and Austria . When Steed said that his perpetual problem was money , he did not mean that the Devon plantations were in financial straits ; they were building two more Atlantic schooners and the manufactures were doing well . The problem was : the rich men of the English governmentrefused to coin sufficient currency to enable the colonies to function . For a century tobacco had been utilized as coinage , but with the dreadful slumps in recent years , it no longer served as currency ; instead business was conducted with the aid of an incredible melange of paper documents and European coins . Letters of credit from one merchant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were more highly sought than those of John Hancock , Robert Morris and Simon Steed . But these were scarcely adequate to meet the needs of a burgeoning commerce , so every colonist had to contriveone trick or another to get his hands on real money . Were you able to acquire any coins ? ' Steed asked . That 's what I really came for , ' Turlock said , and he took Steed to a bench beside the creek , and there , when they were alone , he confided , ' We took a merchantman . Spanish . Look . ' And carefully he unwrapped a large cloth packet which had been secreted in his coat . Loosening the ends , he spread a hoard of gold coins in the sunlight . You have big-joes ! ' Steed said excitedly , for it had been some time since he had seen these splendid gold coins of Portugal ; they had been minted in 1723 during the reign of King Joao and bore his bewigged portrait and name in Latin , Ioannes , from which the American name derived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollars , was called popularly a big-joe ; when sawed in half , which was usually the case , it was a half-joe . And these , ' Turlock said proudly , sifting the pile to show the Spanish doubloons , the English sovereigns and the mass of livres tournois , the smaller French coin which circulated the world as a standard . It was a worthy trip , ' Steed said , and as he retied the packet , returning it to his captain for deposit at headquarters in Patamoke , he reflected on how strange it was that the capture of a merchant ship should be celebratedon Devon : What our family used to condemn as piracy we now praise as patriotism . The long voyage that Captain Turlock started in late 1775 was notable for a chaotic chain of events : the vast profits earned on Portuguese salt , the running fight with the English frigate Chancery , the two months in a Lisbon jail for lack of proper papers , the capture of a rich merchantman heading home from Peru , the start of Matt 's education. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ named Mr. Semmes who had been taught to read by the fat Rector of Wrentham . When Captain Turlock learned that his mate had studied with the rector , there was salty discussion of that churchman 's habits and Mr. Semmes said , He taught me to read , hoping to acquire thereby a servant for nothing . When I said I was going to sea , he sought to have me arrested as a deserting bondsman . ' Did you punch him in the nose ? ' No . ' Pity . ' Mr. Semmes had a fine sense of the sea , and one day as young Matt was lugging him his breakfast he caught the boy 's arm and asked , Do you intend being a captain ? ' and Matt said , I do , ' and Mr. Semmes said , Then you must learn to read and write , ' and the boy said , Cap 'm does n't read or write , ' and Captain Turlock knocked the lad down and growled as he got up , I 'd be a better captain if I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flat board Mr. Semmes drew the alphabet and the numbers , and for three days Matt memorized them . Within a brief time he was writing not only his own name but also those of the crew ; he would lie on a hatch cover and write down the name of every sailor who passed , and before long he knew the spelling of each . But what fascinated him was the ship 's log , for he realized that it recorded facts much more important than names . The life of the ship is written here , ' Mr. Semmes said as he made his entries , and Matt tried to be present whenever the observations were recorded : Course Eastnorth-east . Day calm . All canvas . ' And to understand better what the words meant , he mastered the compass and could box it as well as any sailor , rattling off the hundred and twenty-eight points as if playing a game . Listen , Mr. Semmes , I 'm going to do the Second Quarter . ' And he would stand at attention and recite in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , East three-quarters south , East by south . And now the hard one ! East-south-east three-quarters east . ' And as he completed each quarter , Mr. Semmes would applaud . The day came when Captain Turlock shot the noonday sun , then walked to where the ship 's log was kept , and instead of barking his data to Mr. Semmes he gave them to Matt and watched with glowing eye as his red-headed son wrote in large childish letters : Latitude 39  --  Io ' North . Longitude 29  --  15 ' West approx . ' Teach entered his positions in this form because with the aid of a good sextant captured from a Spanish merchantmanhe could be sure of his latitude , but lacking a reliable clock , he had to guess his longitude . But when he saw the entry completed , as well as Mr. Semmes could have done , he had to turn away lest he betray his emotion , for Matt was the first in his lineage going back five thousand years who could write ,  |p360and  his arrival at learning seemed much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unlimited lay ahead . In the spring of 1776 it became apparent that the contentious lawyers of Massachusetts and the philosophical patriots of Virginia were determined to take the thirteen colonies out of the British Empire , and nothingthat the more prudent loyalists of Pennsylvania and Maryland might caution was listened to . Echoes of meetings occurring in Philadelphia , in which men as stable as the Marylander Charles Carroll were actually discussing revolution , filtered down to the Eastern Shore , but they were not credited , for most of the citizens in towns like Patamoke or on plantations like Devon wanted to remain attached to England . They saw every reason for doing so ; they calculated each advantage . Levin Paxmore was typical . As a Quaker he had lived to see his religion accepted without serious restraint ; true , he had to pay a fine for not drilling with the militia , and he still had to contribute thirty pounds of tobacco each year to the Church of England , but he viewed these only as irritating impositions . He was free to pray as he wished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind in meeting , and to rear his children in his faith , and these were freedoms to be cherished . His business also prospered under English rule ; for the past nineteen years he had risen every morning with more work to do than he could complete , and while he often had to wait for payment because no money circulated , he was never defrauded . Right now , things were better than they had been in many years ; he had finished two schooners for Simon Steed , and had two more under way , with additional inquiries from officials in Philadelphia . For some time he had known that gunfire with the English was inescapable , but he still trusted that it would be brief and without damaging consequences . But now he began hearing rumors of actual separation , and some of his more apprehensive neighbors were talking about returning to the homeland , England , if the troubles worsened . When two Quakers from the meeting approached him with a sensible plan for repatriation , he assembled his family in that spare room at Peace Cliff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by which her brood would live . I believe we should stay with the land , ' he said . Our task is to bring God 's commonwealth into being here . ' Even if Maryland separates from England ? ' Ellen asked . There will be no separation , ' he said firmly . I expect trouble , perhaps serious trouble , but we will always be English . ' And by holding up his left hand , as if to silence further comment , he forestalled his wife 's question as to why , if they were to be English , he was building ships intended for use against the English . For Simon Steed such decisions were more difficult . His whole being was tied to Europe ; his business interests focused in England , for whichp361he felt the warmest ties . In London , Fithians held his wealth ; in Berkshire , his forefathers had defended the faith ; and while his own education had been in France , it was to England that he looked for fundamental leadership . Up and down the Atlantic coast thousands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and deciding to remain loyal to the king . In Simon 's case the impetus to do so was greater , because he was married to an English girl who desperately wanted to go home . Steed was distressed that she retained her animosity toward the colonies ; she now abhorred the Eastern Shore and what she termed its provincialism . Her husband 's repeated assertion that from here she could keep in touch with the entire world did not satisfy her . The Americans she saw were boors , and were threatening to become traitors as well . The horrible Captain Turlock who brought his big foes to their countinghousenever confessed what English ships he had robbed to get them , and to think of those miserable idiots that she had seen in Virginia presuming to govern a new nation was absurd , the height of folly . The birth of her daughter had not been easy , and the infant was proving difficult . Jane was convinced that it was Choptank water that irritated the baby , and she grew to loathe the ugly name of that river which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Derwent , those are real rivers . Who ever heard of a river whose water was always salt ? ' ' At Edentown it 's fresh , ' her husband pleaded . ' And who ever heard of mosquitoes on the Thames ? ' she fumed . ' Simon , I warn you , if those fools in Philadelphia utter one word against the king , I 'm going home . ' In July the shocking word reached her that men in Philadelphia , including Charles Carroll and Samuel Chase of Maryland , had not only declared their independence of England but had also dared to put in writing the insulting list of charges against the king . ' The impudence ! ' she stormed . ' Those pretentious upstarts ! ' When her rage subsided she said coldly , ' You watch , Simon . We 'll punish you the same way we did the Scots . ' And from the moment news of the Declaration reached her , she directed all her energy to preparations for flight . She refused to remain in this rebellious colony and relished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discipline it . Teach Turlock did not hear of the formal Declaration until late August , but this did not signify , for he had been conducting his private war for more than a year now . In January he had been so bold as to venture into the Thames on the gamble that the Whisper had not yet been identified as a privateer , and he had been right , but trade with the colonies was so depressed that he was unable to pick up any profitable shipments and had left England with empty holds . When he reached St. Ubes he found that merchant ships had loaded all available salt , and it became apparent that the profits for this voyage would be limited to what he might steal from French or Spanish merchantmen.  |p362He  met none , so the Whisper drifted back and forth across the Caribbean , but when it put into Martinique on the chance of picking up even the most trivial cargo , French captains advised him that the thirteen colonies had become the United States of America and were engaged in open warfare against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remembering Maryland 's constant feuding with Virginia . We 'll never be united . ' Then his chin firmed , making his beard bristle , and he told the French with joy , Now it 's real war ! ' And he stormed back to his schooner . North of Barbados he captured and sank a small English trader , setting her crew adrift in lifeboats . He then cruised northeast to intercept any English ships bound for Martinique or Guadaloupe , and here he caught another small English trader , again setting her crew adrift in sight of land . His third capture occurred almost in the shadow of Caracas ; it was a Spanish ship well laden , and after it was robbed , it was set loose . And his fourth interception was a substantial English merchantman heading out of Panama for Jamaica . That night young Matt Turlock wrote in the log the words that glorified the privateer : For each gun , one ship . ' The Whisper carried four cannon , and with them it had captured four prizes . No privateer could do better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his feats were trumpeted from shore to shore . He had a small casket of big foes and livres tournois , but when he spread them on the desk at the countinghouse , his employer came with perplexing news : Captain , the Council of Safety at Annapolis has requisitioned the Whisper . You 're to carry the families back to England . ' Which families ? ' As Steed tried to explain , his voice choked and he turned away to compose himself , but when he turned back to talk with his captain , his face flushed and he hurried from the countinghouse . What 's happened ? ' Turlock asked the man who came to count the coins . Families loyal to the king are being taken back to England . ' Steed going ? ' No , but his wife is . . . and the baby . ' Turlock could not fathom this . In his world a man told a wife what to do , and she did it unless she wanted a beating from the broad side of a shovel . For a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take a child along was unprecedented . Not right , ' he muttered as the coins were removed . But it happened . The Whisper sailed to Baltimore , where two families came aboard ; one woman knelt down and kissed the deck , crying , It 's a blessing to be on an English ship , ' but then she saw Captain Turlock and asked tearfully , Is he taking us to England ? '  |p363At  Annapolis nine families joined , and from the tidewater plantations another six ; at Patamoke two groups were taken on , with slaves carrying vast amounts of luggage . As the trim schooner moved down the Choptank , a barge moved out from Devon Island containing Jane Fithian Steed , her infant daughter and her husband . A rope ladder was lowered from the Whisper , but before Mrs. Steed could climb up , her husband caught her by the arm and said , ' I ' 11 join you in England . For the present I must tend the plantation . ' But she said sternly , You 'll never come to England @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But what . . . ' Before he could frame his question she was clambering aboard the rescue ship , and when she reached the deck her husband lifted their baby in the air and passed it along to sailors leaning down to take it . Slaves tossed up the luggage and the Whisper moved on , leaving the barge drifting in midstream . But the passenger list was not complete . As the Whisper headed for the bay , a speedy sloop appeared from the direction of Patamoke , firing a small gun to attract attention , and when it drew alongside , passengers saw that the fat Rector of Wrentham was appealing to be taken aboard  --  I want no more of these foul colonies . I 'm an Englishman . ' And ropes were lowered so that twelve men could haul him up , after which some nineteen boxes and parcels followed . Only when he was securely on board , with no possibility of retreat , did he discover that the owner of the schooner in which he was fleeing was Simon Steed and her captain Teach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and was seen no more on deck . On the voyage to London young Matt was given the job of caring for the Steed baby , and he quit bringing food and tea to the mess and carried milk and crackers to the child , for whom he acted as nurse and watchman . There were women who could have performed these tasks , but some were stricken with seasickness and others were busy caring for Mrs. Steed , who collapsed in the captain 's cabin as soon as the Whisper cleared the Chesapeake , and none could have cared for the baby better than Matt . He fed her , carried her about the deck and kept her amused with little games . She was less than a year old , and when she wanted to crawl toward the bulkheads , he watched her carefully . While she slept in her basket he felt free to pursue his studies with Mr. Semmes , but he had pretty well exhausted what the mate knew , and he now found a gentlemanfrom Annapolis who was returning to a Sussex home he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in teaching him advanced figuring and verb forms . On most days , however , Matt and the baby stayed in the bow , riding it up and down as the long swells of the summer Atlantic slid past . These were days he would treasure , when whole new fields of knowledge werep364opening up , when he had some appreciation of the mournful tragedy which had overtaken these good families , and when he tended the Steed baby , who rarely cried and seemed to enjoy being with him . But what Matt would remember most was something that occurred not on deck but below . One morning as he was watching over Penny Steed he noticed that his father was nowhere to be seen , and after a while Mr. Semmes came forward to ask in a low voice , Will Master Turlock accompany me ? ' and Matt went belowdecks , where he heard gurgling sounds . They came from the cabin occupied by the Rector of Wrentham , and when he went inside he found the fat clergyman in a furious sweat , with his father standing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a table before the unhappy man , and Captain Turlock was saying , Sign it or I 'll throw you to the sharks . ' ' I wo n't give up my rightful land , ' the fat cleric whimpered . A sharp blow to the back of his head provoked new groans , and the rector cried , You 're killing me ! ' and Turlock said , The only escape is to sign . ' With his left hand he thrust the quill at Wilcok and growled , Sign it , or feed the sharks . ' ' I ' 11 sign ! ' And with the quill he fixed his signature to this paper : Aboard the Whisper to August 1776Of my own free will and without constraint from anyone , I do hereby confess that I obtained from Captain Teach Turlock of Patamoke too acres of his best land through fraud , deceit , malversationand theft , and that I return to the said captain the entirety . Jonathan Wilcok Rector of WrenthamWitness : John Semmes Matthew TurlockWhen the company left the cabin and climbed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the wheel and showed him a box in which the ship 's papers were kept . This one we guard with our life , ' he told his son . For Levin Paxmore the years 1776  --  r777 were a disaster . Under goading from Simon Steed he finished four copies of the Whisper , but learned with dismay that three of them had been quickly captured by the Englishp365and converted into British men-of-war to prey upon the colonists ' shipping . The fourth , the schooner Good Hope , was sent into the Atlantic with an untrained crew of Choptank farmers and was promptly sunk , causing sharp-tongued Ellen Paxmore to tell her husband , I warned thee not to build ships of war . Thee has sent forth a covey , and all have been lost . ' Not Turlock 's , ' he said , at which she reminded him caustically , But that was not built as a ship of war . ' She pestered him to cease his support of this futile fighting ; on all sides the British were victorious , and she interpreted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God looked unfavorably on the rebellion . She predicted that it would soon collapse . But her husband worked on . It 's my job , ' he said as he laid down the keel for his sixth schooner , already named by Isham Steed the Victory . Does thee foresee victory ? ' Paxmore asked as the transom was carved . Not in battle . But I think we shall prove our points to the king and enjoy many more freedoms when this is ended . ' In these early years of the rebellion Simon Steed faced tantalizing decisions . In order to pay for the war , both the government of Maryland and the Continental Congress issued paper money ; patriots were exhortedto turn in their metal coinage and accept these promissory notes , and many did . Crusty men with only a few shillings in hard currency would troop to the customs house and trade their good money for bad and were applauded for their patriotism . Shall we surrender our metal ? ' Isham asked one afternoon when pressures to do so had been exerted by justices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stubbornly , resisting all arguments . As he told Isham , This paper money 's worth nothing . We 'll hold on to our coins and watch the paper collapse . ' And he was right . Within months the paper was depreciated , first $1.50 in paper to $i in coins , then $2.50 and soon sic ) paper to $i real . When this level was reached , and patriotic pressures continued , Isham asked , Could n't we buy some now ? ' but Simon merely glared at him , then predicted , We 'll see the paper sell at thirty to one , ' and before the year was out it stood at forty . Now ? ' Isham asked , but again Simon shook his head , but one day he did come into the office showing excitement . The paper has fallen , eighty to one . Now 's the time to buy . ' But wo n't it collapse altogether ? ' Isham asked . Five hundred to one ? ' No , ' Simon explained . Maryland 's a proud state . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can get . ' And at eighty to one the Steeds began to turn in their solid currency , and Simon was correct . Maryland was proud , and she did redeem her paper at forty to one , which meant that Simon had doubled the family fortune . That he had done so at thep366expense of sentimental patriots did not concern him , for , as he said , the management of money is a skill and must be practiced as such . ' For Captain Turlock the early years of the revolution were a kaleidoscope : a tropical dawn off Panama waiting for an English merchantman ; a quick run to New York with provisions ; long , easy trips to St. Ubes for salt ; a foray into the English Channel in pursuit of an English sloop , a visit to Nantes for the hardware and cordage sorely needed at Baltimore . The Whisper became known as the schooner with the red-headed boy , ' for several captains reported that when the American freebooters stormed aboard they were accompanied by a young lad who kept goadingthem . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a voice unusually deep for a child his age . At first I thought him to be a dwarf , but when he marched up to me and said , " Captain , you are taken , " I found him to be a child . Remarkable . ' Captain Turlock had only a vague understanding of how the war was progressing ; he knew that General Washington was pinned down somewhere in the north and that the Americans seemed to lose more battles than they won , but when a captured English sailor said defiantly , When this war 's done , traitors like you and Ben Franklin will be hanged , ' he asked , What ship does Captain Franklin sail ? ' To the surprise of his crew , the war taught him caution . Not for him the gallant foray into enemy ports , or the futile contest against superior strength . The Whisper had speed and maneuverability , and these could be used best in hit-and-run tactics ; he was not afraid to run and was perfecting at sea the same strategy that American generals were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retreat , the waiting , the cautious move . For in any planning he had to bear in mind that whereas the Whisper could depend upon her speed to escape from the average English ship , three duplicates with identical capacity had been captured by the enemy and now flew English colors . His constant fear was that some day in the Caribbean the three other Paxmore schooners would converge and hunt him down . That explained his caution and why he sometimes returned to the Chesapeake empty , and sometimes even with expensive damages that had to be corrected . And then early in 1777 , when prospects were most bleak , Mr. Steed had an opportunity to observe at firsthand the skill of his barefoot captain . A Lieutenant Cadwallader had come south from New York with an urgent message from General Washington , whose prospects for holding out against the English were fading : The general feels certain we can'tp367survive another year unless France joins us . And with substantial assistance , mind you . Steed , you must go to France . ' I thought Franklin was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paris . But the business leaders  --  the solid men in ports like Nantes  --  they 're convinced we 've no chance of winning . ' I 'd not be effective , ' Steed said , thinking of his own uncertainty about the war . But you could talk to them . You must go . ' ' I 'll try . ' And after Cadwallader had moved on to the southern ports , Steed thought : How ironic . The English Protestants of Philadelphia and New York always sneered at us Catholic boys who went to school at St. Omer 's  --  Why not attend a true college like Oxford ? ' But now it 's the Frenchman who becomes essential . He had no stomach for this mission and no hope that it would succeed . He believed the colonies to be doomed and wondered only what kind of peace England would grant . But he had a high sense of duty , and since he had been handed this ticklish job , he would do his best . It was easy for Cadwallader to say , Go to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Turlock to get there , for when the Whisper reached the exit to the Chesapeake she found waiting a cluster of English guard boats , each with two heavy guns  --  ' Seven of ' em , ' young Matt called from his position forward . I see ' em , ' his father replied . What do we do ? ' Steed asked . We wait . ' For what ? ' The precious moment , ' Turlock said , and they waited . For five tedious days the Whisper sailed slowly back and forth inside the protection of the headlands , while the British vessels held to the open sea . On two occasions American privateers arrived from the east , spotted the British guard boats and retreated to try other ports along the coast , but the Whisper could not employ that stratagem . She was trapped in the Chesapeake , and until her captain devised some trick for escape , she had to stay trapped . During this grating delay Simon Steed conducted himself like the patient negotiator General Washington had assumed him to be . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , deeply wounded by the flight of his wife and desolate over the absence of his daughter . He never complained . At the start of the voyage he had told his captain that speed was essential , and he assumed that Turlock appreciated this . It was now the waterman 's responsibility to break through the blockade , and no one aboard the Whisper knew better than he how to accomplish this.  |p368What  we 're waitin ' for , Mr. Steed , is a stout wind from the west , risin ' at two in the mornin ' . ' What will that prove ? ' You 'll see . ' And on the seventh day , at dusk , Captain Turlock met with Mr. Semmes as the sun sank over Virginia , and they studied the clouds , and Turlock said , Tonight , I think . ' They went to the owner and said , Maybe tonight . It 'll be risky . ' Cannon fire ? ' Much , ' Turlock said , and as darkness fell he alerted his gunners , who moved extra balls into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could see no alteration in the wind , but at one o'clock , with a waning moon showing in the east , he felt a slight agitation moving across the calm waters of the bay , and then a scattered gustiness , followed by dead calm . He supposed that the long-awaited night wind had died down , but Captain Turlock , long familiar with the Chesapeake , moved among his men to say , Before dawn . We 'll be in the middle of them . ' What he was counting on was that if the wind rose sharply , as he was certain it must , it would strike the Chesapeake thirty or forty minutes before it reached the Atlantic ; indeed , in the darkness the British would not even know it was on its way unless they were more weather-wise than he , and without visible indications , that would be unlikely . In that halfhourof superior wind , he proposed to have his schooner at top speed , bearing directly down on the middle of the blockade . If he collided with some enemy vessel , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of escape . What he hoped was that the Whisper could snake her way through the congregated ships and kick her heels in the broad Atlantic . At quarter to two the wind rose substantially and Turlock told his men , At four it 'll be near gale . We go . ' All practical sail was raised , that is , the three jibs forward , the two fore-and-afts and the two lower square sails . The two peak squares would be held in reserve until the last minute , when top speed would be needed ; raising them in the strong wind that seemed about to break would prove dangerous , and Turlock did not want to run that risk until the moment of flight . Then he would risk everything . At half past three he stood just west of the entrance to the bay , hiding as it were among the low Virginia hills , but now he swung the Whisper directly east , and as she picked up speed in the pale , moonlit darkness he cried , Mr. Semmes , all sail ! ' and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rose majestically into canvas-snapping position . Man the guns ! ' Turlock cried , and with his ship as ready as it would ever be , he sped eastward toward the open ocean . It was four-twenty that morning before the British blockaders became aware that a major schooner was bearing down upon them . Bugles blewp369and orders were shouted , but with their mainsails down , the watching boats could not respond quickly , and there was confusion . On came the American vessel , nine sails aloft in the heavy wind , her deck awash , her bow cutting the choppy waves . Fire ! ' the English captains bellowed , and cannon roared  --  to no effect . Hold fire ! ' Turlock cried . His job was not to sink or damage blockade boats , all he wanted was to avoid them ; and this he did with matchless skill until that moment when the captain of the seventh English boat , seeing in the pale light that this daring fool was about to escape , ordered his helmsman to put about and throw his ship directly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! ' Matthew screamed . There was nothing Captain Turlock could do but forge ahead , hoping that his superior weight and expanse of filled sail would inflict greater damage than he received . Stand to crash ! ' he shouted , and Simon Steed , owner of this fine ship , winced . But at the last moment , when the bowsprit of the Whisper was practicallyjabbing at the larboard flank of the English vessel , Turlock spun the wheel as violently as he could to starboard , an action which in the open sea would surely have capsized the schooner , considering the huge spread of sail she was carrying in this wind . But now , as he had calculated , his swift schooner crashed sideways into the smaller English vessel , larboard to larboard , and there was a crunching of timber as the blockader held the Whisper erect . The impact was so sudden , and of such brief duration , that the Whisper seemed to bounce away , largely undamaged . Now Captain Turlock spun the wheel again , this time to larboard , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with the wind almost abeam and strong enough to throw the Whisper down , the bow turned majestically ; the pressure on the sails abated , the ship righted itself , and Turlock told Mr. Semmes to fetch his son . When Matt appeared , flushed with victory , his father said , At the start of the fight Ithought , " My son 's a damned fool . " ' ' Why ? ' Standin ' in the bow like a stupid figurehead . But when it came time to hoist the sails , there you were , workin ' the ropes . ' Matt smiled . And when the cannonballs came crashin ' through , you did n't hide . ' Captain Turlock reached down and rumpled his son 's red hair . You 're goin ' to be a sailor . ' Toward the end of the voyage Steed suffered one bad day . He was casually inspecting a chart showing the entrance to the Loire River , on which Nantes stood , when it occurred to him that at that moment he wasp370only a short sail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleasant images that name evoked : his English wife , his daughter , the honest men at Fithians , the serenity . He thought how startled Captain Turlock would be if he said , Let 's sail north two days and we 'll be in England . ' And he thought : When the war 's over I may move to England . Jane would be happy there , and Isham could run the plantation . And as soon as he formulated these thoughts it became clear that he was visualizing not the total victory that Lieutenant Cadwallader had spoken of , the kind that General Washington apparently wanted , but a kind of negotiated truce , from which the relationships that existed before the war could be reestablished : That 's what I want . The colonies and England back together , but on a better footing . And then he acknowledgedwhy he wanted it : Because we ca n't defeat England . We 're destined to live with her . And I wish this damned war would end . He looked north and muttered , England , England ! ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as much help as possible , so that the colonists could win some battles and appear at the bargaining table in good posture . I 'll do my job , he promised himself , unaware that even at this critical moment he still called his new nation the colonies . He was destined to be a poor ambassador . He was standing there , aloof and overwhelmed with loneliness , when young Matt Turlock left his lookout position and came to talk with him . We 'll soon be sighting France , ' the boy said . Steed ignored the comment , so Matt asked directly , Did n't you live in France ? ' I did . ' The red-headed boy was not abashed by this cool reception . Up there 's England , ' he said . The lonely figure made no response , so Matt continued , They 'd like to know where we are . They 'd like to capture this ship . ' Again no response , so the boy babbled on , I sailed to England once , Mr. Steed . ' Silence  --  except @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took Mrs. Steed and Penny to London . ' At the mention of his daughter 's name , Steed lost his indifference . Did she sail well ? ' he asked . She stayed in a basket forward . I guarded her . ' You did ? No one told me that . ' Yes , Mrs. Steed kept to her cabin , sickly I think . But Penny and I stayed forward day after day . She loved the sea . ' And you cared for her ! ' Steed shook his head , then fumbled in his pocket , producing at last a bright half-joe . I should like to give you this for your trouble , ' he said , handing Matt the coin . The boy offered no mock protestation ; he knew the value of a Portuguese joe and pocketed it with a big Thank you , Mr. Steed . ' Where did she stay ? ' Steed asked . The basket stood here . I brought it out every morning . ' And for the rest of that day Simon Steed remained in the fore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ England , then to the deck where the basket had rested . They entered the Loire at St. Nazaire , where a rude fort pretended to guard the integrity of the river , but it was doubtful if the guns so proudly visible could deliver much weight . A French pilot came aboard to help them negotiate the beautiful river , but he added to Steed 's pessimism by reporting , We give the colonies little chance . It 's ships that will prevail , and England has them . ' When they reached the wharf at Nantes they found that French merchants were vigorously excited about the caviar he was bringing but contemptuous of his principal mission . We see no hope for the Americans . Actually , Steed , we think you 'd be better off remaining with Eng-land . ' Then why do you fight to protect your independence ? War after war , and always against England . ' We 're a nation . With an army . With ships . Your destiny is colonial . ' Wherever he went in Nantes it was the same . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ English , and if the colonies chanced to be the agency for the disaster , fine . Steed heard many expressionsof brotherhood and good will , followed by hard-headed calculationsthat England must win the war . When he dined with the Montaudoins , dictators of the Loire economy , their nephew , who had known Steed as a student , had copious praise for the southern colonies : Gracious land , splendid people . We 're so happy to have you with us , Simon . ' Will you report your enthusiasm to Paris ? ' Steed asked bluntly . Socially , of course . Politically ? I 'm afraid , dear fellow , you have n't a chance . ' Dutifully he went to each of the firms with which he had done business  --  the Baillys , the Brisard du Marthres , the Pucet Fils  --  and from each he heard the same story : The colonies can not win . Accept the best peace available and get on with it . ' He took the long overland journey to Lorient , a port in which the more adventurous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubtful : We French are practical . If there was any chance you could maintainyour independence of the English , we 'd back you ten thousand percent . There is no chance . ' The firm of Berard , with which Steed had conducted much business , organized a formal dinner honoring Steed , not as a political negotiator but as a valued customer , and when the important gentlemen of the area were assembled , a Monsieur Coutelux summarized their attitudes : We have followed with extreme attention events in the colonies and have noted with approbation your determination , starting in 1774 , to free yourselves of commercial domination by London . Yourp372resistance to the various taxes , your insistence that you be free to ship tobacco direct to France instead of through Bristol , your strong inclination toward a French style of self-government  --  all this encouragesus . You are on the right track , Steed . But when you challenge English military might , especially her naval superiority , you are being downright foolish , and you must not expect us to support you in your folly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ England as ever . We merely wait the proper moment to give her the coup de grace . It may come in Spain , or Italy , or some unknown place like India , but somewhere , somehow we 're destined to rule Europe and she 's destined to a minor role . But the timely spot can not be the colonies . You have n't the manpower , the army , the manufacturing or the navy . Your best chance , and I tell you this from the bottom of my heart , is to go home , make peace with London , and await the day when France gives England the mortal thrust . Then , and only then , will you be free . ' Disheartened , Steed returned to Nantes , went aboard the Whisper and consulted with his crew . I must stay in France until help is assured . But you 're free to roam . Captain Turlock , are you willing to risk another run through the blockade ? ' Always . ' Your luck may run out . ' I 've tricks I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on credit , that Captain Turlock should load the Whisper with cloth , brass fittings , salt , ships ' compasses and all the compact manufactured goods for which the starved colonies yearned , hurry home and return to pick up Steed . So on a bright day Turlock sailed down the Loire and out into the Atlantic . When he was gone , Steed began his serious work . Patiently he returned to each merchant , explaining in colloquial French why the coloniesdeserved help in their resistance to England . I know we 've been fighting them since 1775 , with no results . But we 're still in the field , and we 're getting stronger . Believe me , dear friend , we 're getting stronger . ' When they laughed , he asked , Then why did you entrust your cargo with my captain ? Because you know he 'll penetrate the blockade . In seven months he 'll be back for another shipment . You know that . ' He returned to Lorient , went down the coast to La Rochelle , and the more he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too French to argue well the cause of the colonies ; he could not convey the thunderingactuality of the Blue Ridge farmer or a Massachusetts weaver . And then , when his fortunes were at their lowest , he was rescued by a fellow American who spoke the vernacular.  |p373Benjamin  Franklin , chief advocate in France for the colonies , came down to Nantes to meet with the leaders of that city and Lorient and La Rochelle . The Montaudoins placed at his disposal a small chateau , in which he held court , and there Steed met him . He was well past seventy , bald , paunchy , squint-eyed , and as lively as a chestnut on a griddle . He affected a costume that was aggressively American , including a coonskin hat and a gnarled cherry-wood cane . He spoke abominable French with a vigor that made his pronouncements sound fresh and challenging . At the big dinners he gave he rejected sentimentality and never spoke of America 's valiant struggle ; he appealedalways to the fundamental interests of France , and the more mundane he made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and all we seek is tangible support . We seek the privilege of trading freely with your port cities , with profits for you . We want to establish in the New World a counterbalance to the Old , and this will be of advantage primarily to you . ' He was an amazing man . He had brought down from Paris a mysteriouswoman introduced merely as Madame de Segonzac ; her identity and her relationship to Franklin were not explained , but Franklin paid her deference and relied on her to persuade his guests . He also delighted in walking through the streets of Nantes and visiting those shopkeepers who had imported for the occasion the remarkable mementos then floodingParis : teacups with Franklin 's portrait set in porcelain ; snuffboxes decorated with enameled coonskin caps ; silken pillows with embroidered portraits ; and broadsides containing his bespectacled countenance and quotations from Poor Richard . It was these homely , pragmatic aphorismswhich endeared this uncouth American to the French ; in his barbarousway he spoke their language . But nothing he accomplished in Nantes surpassed his performance one afternoon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wharf . There an enterprising merchant from Corsica had imported three of the large china chamber pots containingon their sides portraits of Franklin , and on their insides glazed representations of the coonskin cap . Hundreds had been sold throughout France , but these were the first in Nantes , and when Franklin saw them he stopped , spoke to the Corsican , and watched approvingly as one of the pots was placed in the middle of the street . Then , as sailors guffawed , he showed them what he would look like sitting on his own crockery . There was much cheering , and within two days the story had reached most of the western ports . In his large meetings he never seemed serious , but he always was . He conveyed only one message : The United States shall prevail . And before he had been on the seacoast a week he began convincing those sturdy merchants that it was in their interest to back the fledgling country , not because the United States was relying upon philosophical principles derived from France , and not because there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by doing so , the French could gig the English and at the same time earn a batch of livres tournois . For two months Franklin and Steed worked together , and after Turlockhad brought the Whisper back to Nantes and the time came for parting , the older man said , Simon , your help has been invaluable . ' Steed , aware that he had supported Franklin only half-heartedly , since he did not believe in an ultimate American victory , mumbled , I accomplishednothing . It was you they wanted to hear . ' I was the clown , attracting their attention . It was imperative that you be there to represent the other side of our effort . ' He laughed , then chucked Steed under the chin as if he were a boy . You were the respectableelement , and believe me , Steed , the French businessman hungers for respectability . They never deal with banks that are on the verge . ' Then he became serious . With a firm hand he pulled Steed around until they were facing . When we started our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could see it . Do you believe now ? ' I 'm confused . It seems to me we should stay with England . ' Franklin did not protest . Let 's go to your schooner , ' he suggested , and when they sat in Captain Turlock 's cabin he said forcefully , Simon , we 're destined to win . I know our armies are in retreat everywhere and we 've no navy . But the great sweep of human desire fights on our side , and we can not be defeated . ' He pointed out the cabin door and said , Look at him . The new American . ' And there stood Captain Turlock , barefooted , grimy from working on his ship , clothed in near rags , but ready to storm his way into Bristol port if asked . Why did you choose him for your captain ? ' Franklin asked . Because he knows . . . he knows what a ship can do . ' General Washington chose you to come here because you know . You know what a plantation can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see what a collection of men like you and Captain Turlock can accomplish . ' He rose in a state of euphoria and orated as if he were trying to persuade the merchants of Nantes : We can remake the world . Simon , we 're going to win . ' And from that moment in Nantes harbor , Simon Steed never doubted ; he cast aside his cautious love for England , his romantic longing for the old securities , and leaped into the full tide of the revolution . As a result of what he and Franklin achieved in the next week , the solid business community of the French coast awakened to the probabilitythat the United States might indeed win their war of attrition and become a major commercial center . Opposition to French involvement in what had hitherto been regarded as merely another idealistic uprising diminished , and the way was paved for the vigorous participation of that remarkable trio of French military geniuses who would join Lafayette in helping the United States maintain its independence : Rochambeau , Bougainvilleand , above all , De Grasse.  |p375When  the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Franklin confided , I 've written to the Congress suggesting that you be named agent for the southern states . ' For what ? ' For the acquisition of supplies . ' I do n't understand . ' Ships . Men like Captain Turlock . Scatter them over the face of the ocean . Bring in muskets and powder and chain and cloth for uniforms . Steed , an army survives on things . . . like chickens and brass cannon . Get those things . ' Simon Steed was the kind of man to whom such a specific suggestion was a command , and on the spur of the moment he asked Franklin , What should I take back now ? ' and he was astonished at the reply : Nothing . Leave Nantes with empty holds . ' Such a waste .. Speed to St. Eustatius . ' That tiny island ? ' Tiny but powerful . It 's owned by the Dutch , and we 've been assemblingthere a body of munitions you 'd not believe . ' What do we use for money ? ' Credit . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're engaged in a risk so grave it terrifies me . Your risk comes at St. Eustatius . ' So they parted , each man engaged in a gamble of staggering dimension : to fail meant ruin and death at the hangman 's trap ; to win meant the establishment of a nation founded on new principles whose possibilitieswere only dimly understood . In the hostile port of Nantes , where no man believed America could survive , Simon Steed had convinced himself of those new principles , and to them he was willing to dedicate his fortune and his life . We 'll sail tonight , ' he told Captain Turlock . Empty ? ' Yes . To St. Eustatius . ' Never been there , ' Turlock said , but he was ready to go . That any mariner could find St. Eustatius was a miracle , but a greater miracle awaited him when he did find it . For it was one of the smallest islands on earth , a volcanic , rocky pinpoint lost in a cluster of islands north of Guadeloupe . Captain Turlock , seeking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it did not exist , when his son cried , Cap 'm , land to starboard , ' and there , emerging from the sea like a mysterious sentinel , rose the jagged shores of St. Eustatius.  |p376As  the Whisper maneuvered to enter the minute harbor Simon Steed was overwhelmed by what he saw : a shoreline crowded with great warehouses ; so much cordage and cotton that bales were left standing uncovered ; no police , no soldiers , no naval guns protecting the place ; and in the cramped waters between the headlands not less than sixty vessels . He found out that five or six heavily laden ships put into port daily bringing goods from Europe and Africa , while an equal number left carrying those goods to the embattled American colonies . As one British admiral , furiousat the insolence of the place , complained , It 's the richest small island that ever was on earth . ' It existed in a fairy-tale atmosphere ; it was owned by the Dutch , who were at war with nobody , but the goods coming to it were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Portugal and , especially , France and England . This last was particularly aggravating to the British : English chandlers who refused to supply English warships in Plymouthsurreptitiously consigned their best goods to St. Eustatius , where they were sold to American vessels fighting England . Also , many a stout merchantman sailing from London with papers for Italy or Greece changed course dramatically south of the Channel and hied off to St. Eustatius , where profits were trebled . Captain Turlock could not tie up to any dock ; thirty vessels were ahead of him . But from his anchorage he rowed ashore to purchase the materials of war needed along the Chesapeake : the strongest English cordage , double-thick French brassware , muskets from Austria and salt from Poland . He bought wisely , from a score of different merchants speaking many different languages , and when the bills were totaled he had Mr. Steed issue letters of credit . With the Whisper loaded as heavily as its timbers would allow , he hoisted anchor and set out for America , having no idea of how he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in to if he succeeded . It was a bright , sunny run before the wind , but it ended abruptly , for a major English squadron patrolled the Chesapeake and not even a canny dissembler like Turlock could slip through . He sailed north toward Boston , but was intercepted by an American frigate , a pitiful affair with untrained crew and few guns , whose captain cried on speaking-trumpet , Turn back ! You ca n't get into Boston . ' So the Whisper and its priceless cargo drifted south , hoping to land somewhere in the Carolinas , but they , too , were rimmed by English warships , and at a meeting of desperation Turlock told his owner , Mr. Steed , the best we can do is beach her somewhere in the Delaware Counties . Carry the goods overland . ' Mr. Semmes agreed that no other strategy was practical , so Steed had to approve . But you 'll lose twenty percent in pilferage , ' he said . To which Turlock answered , You 'll add forty percent to the price . ' So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where thep377Chesapeake squadron would not detect her , and when the latitude of Lewes on the Delaware coast was reached , she turned abruptly west and sped toward shore . There , at the mouth of a small stream , she dropped anchor , boats were lowered and unloading began . Before the first cargo was got ashore men from the Delaware Counties appeared and parties were organized to portage these crucial military supplies across the peninsula to the eastern shores of the Chesapeake , from which they would be ferried to Baltimore . You will be paid , ' Steed promised the Delaware men . Pay or no , we 'll get to Baltimore . ' They were men who had been fighting the English for three long years ; victory seemed farther away than ever but surrender was a word they did not use . When the schooner was emptied , Steed told his captain , Go back to St. Eustatius . Make as many voyages as possible . ' And thus the golden ferry between the Dutch entrepSt and the colonies began . In the years that followed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Simon Steed took control . He recorded each item , awarded it the highest value possible , turned it over to the fledgling government , and allocated to himself a handler 's fee of thirty percent above the inflated cost of the goods . If the war dragged on , and if Captain Turlock continued his daring escapades , the Steeds would be millionaires , and not in dollars , in pounds sterling . But in late lm events took a bad turn ; daring English sea captains converted the Chesapeake into an English lake . They sailed boldly to the head of the bay , landed an enormous army there and marched on Philadelphia , hoping to cut the colonies in half , knock out those in the north , then the remainder in the south . Word reached the Choptank that a massive battle had been fought along the banks of a stream called Brandywine , and that Philadelphia had fallen , and that General Washington had escaped annihilation only by retreating to the environs of an iron mill called Valley Forge . That he could recover sufficiently to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revolution was at hand . A squadron of English ships sailed boldly into the Choptank , anchoredoff Patamoke and bombarded the town . When no opposition appeared , landing parties came ashore and a lieutenant trim in gold and blue announced , We have come to burn that infamous nest of sedition , the Paxmore Boatyard , ' and with flaming torches his men set fire to the wooden sheds and retired . There was on the ways at this time the nearly completed Victory ; her spars were not yet in place and there was some minor caulking to be done , but she was almost a schooner and was desperately needed . So when the flames were hottest , and it seemed that this precious vessel must go to ashes , Levin Paxmore , his dark hair outlined by the fire ,  |p378rushed  into his doomed boatyard and began chopping away the struts that held the Victory on the ways , trusting that once it was set free , it would slide down the railway and launch itself into the harbor , where any flames attacking it could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men of the town gathered to cheer him on , unmindful of the final salvos fired by the retreating English ships , but none volunteered actually to move in among the flames to help chop away the struts , for the heat was too fierce . Ellen Paxmore , infuriated by the bombardment and alerted by the fires brightening her sky , had come to the boatyard and had quickly understood what her husband was attempting . She , too , was appalled at the thought of this fine schooner 's being burned , and when no one else would help Levin , she grabbed an ax and disappeared into the flames , but she had chosen a spot which no one could have conquered ; the fire was raging and she had to withdraw . A slave named Pompey  --  a name awarded in ridicule by some plantationscholar trained in the classics  --  watched Mrs. Paxmore 's valiant attempt , and now quenched with his bare hands the sparks that threatenedher gray dress . After he had done this he grabbed her ax and dashed into the flames , where he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! ' the crowd roared , and slowly the Victory crept down the ways , gathered speed and splashed into the harbor . Now men were more than willing to leap into small boats and crowd the prematurely launched vessel , splashing water upon the flickering flames and securing the hull to shore . Levin Paxmore , assured that his new schooner was safe , even though his boatyard was in ashes , walked painfully home , expecting to have his burns immediately cared for . Instead he was confronted by the most profound discussion of his life , for his wife awaited him , her own burns unattended : ELLEN : Did thee notice , Levin ? The only man brave enough to help was the slave Pompey ? LEVIN : I did n't see . ELLEN : Thee never sees . Pompey sprang into the fire . Pompey helped me fight the flames eating at my dress . Pompey chopped away the struts . Does this mean nothing ? LEVIN : It means we saved the Victory . ELLEN : It means he is a man , a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holding such a man to slavery ? LEVIN : My hands ache . ELLEN : My heart aches . Levin , I can not abide another day in this condition . These colonies are fighting for freedom . Men like Simon Steed perform miracles in the name of freedom , but they ignore the gravest problem of all . Right on their home doorsteps . LEVIN : Pompey 's a good slave . When he 's rented to me I treat him justly.  |p379ELLEN  : By what right has thee been ordained to treat justly or unjustly ? Is thee a God because thee is white ? LEVIN : What does thee want me to do ? ELLEN ( lowering her voice and taking her husband by his burned hands ) : Come First Day , I want thee to rise and propose that henceforth no Quaker who owns a slave can remain a member of our meeting . LEVIN : Thee has tried that gambit a dozen times . ELLEN : But thee has not , and thy word will carry substantial weight . LEVIN : I am busy building @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they are helping to ensure freedom . ELLEN : A greater war than that on the Chesapeake is being fought . LEVIN : What does that mean ? ELLEN : Surely these colonies will have their freedom , one way or another . England or a confederation , what does it signify , really ? But the freedom of men .. . LEVIN : That , too , will follow . . . in due course . ELLEN : It will not ! ( Here her voice rose again . ) More than a hundred years ago in this town Ruth Brinton Paxmore begged the Quakers to set their slaves free . Nothing happened . Fifty years ago thy grandmother made the same plea , with the same results . Fifty years from now my granddaughter will throw the same words into the wilderness unless we takeLEVIN : Slavery will die out of its own weight , thee knows that . ELLEN : I know it will persist forever unless good people fight it . Levin , on First Day thee must testify . LEVIN : I can not inject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! This day a black man saved me , leaped among the flames like a salamander . Would thee leave him there in the fire ? LEVIN : I can not follow when thee engages in hyperbole . ELLEN : And I can no longer rest in this house so long as even one member abides slavery . Levin , I must make my bed elsewhere . LEVIN ( dropping his head onto the bare table ) : I have lost my yard , my tools . And my hands are burning with fire . I need help , Ellen . ELLEN : And thee will lose thy immortal soul if thee turns thy back on Pompey . He , too , needs help . LEVIN ( leaping to his feet ) : What does thee demand ? ELLEN : Thy testimony . . . in public ... come First Day . ( Silence , then in a gentle voice . ) Levin , thee has been preparing for this day . I 've seen thee watching the black people of this town . The time has come . I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the future . LEVIN : Can thee put some bear grease on my hands ? They burn . Terribly they burn . ELLEN ( applying the grease ) : This means that thee will speak ? LEVIN : I have not wanted to . In these affairs God moves slowly . Butp380Pompey is a decent man . Thee says it was he who chopped away the restraining poles ? ELLEN : He did . But he does not warrant thy support because of his acts . He warrants it because of his existence . LEVIN : I suppose it 's time . I 'll testify for thee . ELLEN : Not for me and not for Pompey because he helped . For the great future of this nation  --  the future that Ruth Brinton saw . So on a First Day in late 1777 Patamoke Meeting was startled to find itself in the midst of a debate that would tear the church apart . The members had come to the ancient meeting house expecting that words of consolationmight be offered to Levin Paxmore over the loss of his boatyard or prayers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , after nine brief minutes of silence , Levin Paxmore rose , his hands bandaged , his hair singed : The Bible says that sometimes we see through a glass darkly . For me it required a great fire which destroyed my handiwork , but in those flames there moved a figure comparable to Shadrach , Meshachand Abednego . It was the slave Pompey , owned by a member of this meeting who hires him out to others . I did not see what Pompey accomplished , but I am told he was most valiant and it was to him that the merit goes for saving the schooner . In the days since the fire I have been asking myself how it could be that a slave with nothing to gain and all to lose should throw himself into my fire , to save my schooner ? And the only answer that makes any reason is that Pompey is a man exactly like me . He breathes like me , and eats , and works , and sleeps when he is tired . How do I know ? Because I saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bandaged like mine . The fire burns him as it burns me . Here he held his bandaged hands aloft , and many began to feel uneasy . Therefore , today I reverse everything I have previously argued in this meeting . Slaves must be set free . In the name of God and Jesus Christ they must be set free , and no man dare call himself a Quaker and a slaveholder , too . ' The meeting broke up in consternation . Levin Paxmore was its most prosperous member , and also one of its sagest . Those opposed to change had always counted on him to support them : Let us move slowly . Let us study this for the next Yearly Meeting . ' And now he had broken the covenant and called bluntly for immediate manumission on pain of expulsion.  |p381At  the Quarterly Meeting in December 1777 the Quakers of the Choptankbecame the first important religious group in the south to outlaw slavery among its members . In spite of Levin Paxmore 's unflinching leadership , the issue was bitterly fought and it required two days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; even then seven obdurate men stormed from the hall vowing to surrender Quakerism rather than their slaves . It had required more than a hundred years for this most liberal of the southern Christian sects to decide that human slavery was inconsistent with Christian principles ; the more conservative sects would require an additional century . When the decision was announced , Levin Paxmore touched his scarred hands and told his wife , The burning has stopped , ' and she knew why . For those Americans who lived within the benediction of the Chesapeake , the culminating crisis of the revolution occurred in 1781 . Indeed , the future of America and perhaps of the world then stood in peril , for it seemed that the attempt at self-rule must be crushed , and with it the hopes of millions in Europe for a better pattern of life . In that year the English army , consolidated at last under a succession of daring generals , began to chew the south apart . Victory upon victory crushed General Washington 's lieutenants in Georgia and South Carolina , and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how brave , were no match for hundreds of well-trained English regulars supp. rted by large guns . And when General Cornwallis began ravaging Virginia , and Admiral Rodney assembled a fleet of battleships in the Caribbean , ready to invade the Chesapeake , it seemed obvious that the rebellion was doomed . New York lay in English hands ; Philadelphia was neutralized ; Boston and Newport were powerless to send support , and no major port along the Atlantic was open to American vessels , even if any had succeeded in penetrating the blockade . Men had begun to talk openly of defeat and started calculating among themselves what kind of terms they might be able to wheedle from the victorious English . Even General Washington had faltered in his dogged optimism , sending Steed of Devon a letter which summarized the times : Where pray God is the French fleet that you and Franklin assured me would spring to our defense ? Without their aid and without it soon , I fear we are doomed . My men mutiny . More deserters leave camp than recruits arrive . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sustain their dignity , and above all , no pay . Only the iron will of our junior officers holds this army together , and there is little hopep382that they can sustain this miracle throughout the balance of this year . Friend Steed , we must have immediate help from France . Have you any practical way of rushing this message to Paris ? If so , depart at once and tell them the whole fortune of the war hangs in the balance , which must dip against us if our impoverishment continues . We need arms and food and cloth and money and particularly a French navy to offset the strangulation that threatens . I implore you , Steed , do something . There was nothing he could do . He could send no imploring letters to Nantes , for no mail could penetrate the blockade . He could not try to slip across to France himself , for Captain Turlock was absent in the Caribbean . And he could not even board his family sloop and sail to Virginia to help fight Cornwallis , because English patrol boats dominatedthe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , watching the disaster ; he was not even aware of the greater disaster that had overtaken his two schooners at St. Eustatius . Captain Turlock , in the Whisper , had been highly pleased with Simon Steed 's nephew , Norman , as skipper of the new Victory . He was venturesomeyet obedient to signals , daring yet prudent in protecting his ship . He 'll make a fine captain , ' Turlock told his son as they watched the young man . Together they had made three runs to St. Eustatius , transporting enormous cargoes , which Simon Steed sold at profit to the hungry armies of General Washington . They were now beginning a fourth sally , and if they could somehow smuggle the two schooners into Boston or Savannah , they stood to make a fortune . So as they drifted easily southward through the Virgin Islands , keeping watch for any English prowlers , Captain Turlock invited his colleague aboard the Whisper for a final consultation . The trick this time , get in and out as fast as possible . ' Always before we 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' Turlock said . Howl the younger man asked . England is getting ready for the kill . Too much movement . ' I saw nothing coming down . ' Me neither , ' Turlock grunted . But things are changed . In fast . Out fast . ' Norman Steed could not comprehend how a man could see nothing and be told nothing and yet sense that somehow the world had changed . He paid his respects to Captain Turlock and rowed back to the Victory , but when the two schooners passed St. Maarten , that strange island half French , half Dutch , he saw that Captain Turlock had launched a boat ,  |p383which  came scudding across with an imperative : At St. Eustatius the Whisper is to enter first . Keep a close watch . ' But when they approached the golden isle nothing had changed . There were the forested masts , the bustling porters , the reassuring Dutch flag drooping heavily in the still air . Indeed , there was so little breeze that when Captain Steed 's Victory reached the entrance in good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made that turn , which put her into the harbor some distance ahead of the Whisper . But as the sleek new schooner moved to anchor , for there was still no room at any of the wharves , a shattering gunfire broke out , the mast of the Victory was carried away , and her young captain lay dead with two musket balls through his chest . It was Captain Turlock 's intention to storm into the harbor and revengethis craven act , but no sooner had he broken out his four guns than Mr. Semmes cried , Captain ! Those ships are all English ! ' And that was true . Admiral Rodney , commander of the Caribbean squadron , had at last grown choleric over the insolence of the Dutch in maintaining this treasonous entrepot , and with a squadron large enough to blow the island out of the sea , had captured it . Then , craftily , he kept the Dutch flag flying , luring freebooters like young Norman Steed into the range of his guns . St. Eustatius was no longer golden ; it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned the Whisper away , leaving young Steed dead , the Victory lost and her Choptank crew headed for the Old Mill prison at Plymouth . Numbed with fury at having been so tricked , he stormed through the Caribbean , tackling any English vessel he came upon . On one glorious cruise , years before , he had taken one prize for each of his four guns , the best a freebooter could hope for . Now he took two for each gun , and the booty in the bowels of his schooner became enormous ... and a tantalizing misery . For he could land it nowhere . The principal reason why he had been free to rampage through the myriad islands was that England had moved her major battleships northwestward to encase the colonies in a rim of iron . The strangulation that General Washington had feared was under way , and there was no device by which Teach Turlock could land his captured booty . And then , one day in late August as he languished off the Carolinas , hoping to find some refuge , he overtook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave him tremendous news : The French have come ! ' They told of General Lafayette , that conceited but brave man , who had marched into Virginia , restoring order and maneuvering so brilliantlythat he had General Cornwallis cooped on the York Peninsula . They spoke of a powerful effort , through all the colonies , to reinforcep384Lafayette and bring the war to a conclusion . And then they reported the most electrifying news of all : They say a French fleet has arrived to clear the Chesapeake ! ' That means we can get home ! ' Turlock cried , and within five minutes he was clearing his decks for a swift dash north . How beautiful the Whisper was as she sped toward Cape Hatteras , wind to larboard , her bow cutting into the waves , her decks aslant , and young Matt forward peering for sight of Cape Henry . Gulls followed , wheeling and dipping , and sun glistened on the lines . It was good to be heading home in time of trouble , to stand with one 's own kind against the enemy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occupants confirmed the incredible : French ships guarding the bay ! You 'll have easy entrance ! ' Now that the shoals of Hatteras were safely passed , Captain Turlock piled on more sail , so that the Whisper leaped through the waters , making the speed that Levin Paxmore had predicted , but as the rich voyage neared completion Turlock knew that it was not one of triumph , for he had lost his sister ship , and he damned the English , hoping that the French would smash them . Then came the cry  --  forward  --  from young Matt : Cap 'm ! Battleships ! All English ! ' And there , moving majestically toward the entrance to the Chesapeakecame four great ships of the line : Royal Oak , 74 guns ; London , go guns ; Invincible , 74 guns ; Intrepid , 64 guns . With grand indifferent motion they rolled in the swells , indomitable , relentless . They saw the Whisper but ignored her ; they knew they could not catch her in the open sea . Their job was to crush the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whisper could be easily handled . She would be driven from the seas . But now Matt cried again : Cap 'm ! More ! ' And seven more gigantic ships loomed from the horizon , the most powerful ships of the English navy . Cap 'm ! More coming ! ' And eight more towering vessels , terrifying to the sailors on the small Whisper , hove into sight : Monarch , Centaur , Montagu , Ajax . They came like platforms of death , monstrous engines of war rolling in the sea like whales impervious to the small fish surroundingthem . When the line had passed , Captain Turlock asked Mr. Semmes to make an entry in the log : 4 September 1781 . At dusk well east of Cape Henry we were passed by nineteen great ships of the English line , heading for the Chesapeake . May God in His mercy strengthen the French , for tomorrow we live or die with their ships.  |p385The  French could not have been in a weaker position to engage the English squadron . Some days earlier Admiral de Grasse had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of twenty-four ships , but imprudently he had anchored his flotilla inside the headlands ; worse , he had given liberty to almost half his crew , who were now foraging the shores of the bay for food and water . Still worse , since none of his ships were copper-sheathed like the English , they were perishing from the worms . And worst of all , his position allowed him no room in which to maneuver . He was trapped , and when scouting boats rushed in with news that Admiral Rodney was bearing down with the entire Caribbean squadron , he realized his peril . If De Grasse had been a prudent man , he might have surrendered then and there , for the enemy had every advantage except one : the British ships were sleek-bottomed and free of worm ; their crews were complete and battle-hardened ; they had the advantage of the wind and ocean space in which to maneuver ; and they had guns of shattering power manned by the best seamen in the world . The only disadvantage the English suffered was that Admiral Rodney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ships ; his place had been taken by an indecisive gentleman of little battle experience named Gatch . The accident which caused this substitution was one of those misadventureswhich occur from time to time , as if to prove that human history can never be an exact science : the English government had sent to the Caribbean their best admiral , Rodney , and a plethora of their best ships . Victory over De Grasse was ensured . But when Rodney captured St. Eustatius he became so bedazzled by the riches there and so mortally tempted by a chance to steal some four million pounds for himself , that he dallied among the warehouses and wasted time among the overflowingshops , and in the end even requisitioned a small squadron of the best battleships to convoy him back to London in style . His absence , and especially the absence of the diverted ships , gave the trapped French squadron one slim chance of escape . Captain Turlock , of course , did not know of Rodney 's absence , and when dawn broke on the morning of September fifth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ east , like a gnat watching eagles , ' he said , he saw the great ships of the English line form like an arrow and move toward the mouth of the bay , where the trapped French ships could be destroyed one at a time . It 's to be a massacre , ' he told Mr. Semmes , and to his son he said , When you become a captain , never let yourself be caught at the mouth of a bay . ' Then , remembering his disasterat St. Eustatius , he added , Nor at the mouth of a harbor , either . ' Look , Cap 'm ! ' Matt cried , and in the distance , barely visible , came the first of the French warships . My God ! ' Mr. Semmes cried . They 're going to run it ! '  |p386There  they came , a line of vessels with almost no chance of escaping , with no room for subtle maneuvering or the arts of war , just forging blindly ahead , out of their trap and trusting for a chance to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Saint Esprit , 8o guns ; Marseillais , 74 guns . Look ! ' Matt shouted , and there came the most powerful ship afloat , the gigantic Ville de Paris , no guns . They 're going to make it ! ' Mr. Semmes cried , slapping Captain Turlockon the back , but the captain said nothing . For more than an hour he just stood there , staring at this incredible scene of twenty-four disadvantagedFrench warships turning the tide of battle by an act of supreme courage . When the last of the line stood free , away from the confines of the bay and ready to form a battle line , he turned to Mr. Semmes and said , We saw it . No one will believe us , but we saw it . ' Like a deer breaking loose from dogs , De Grasse had leaped his barriers and gained space . Belatedly the English admiral responded . His prey had sprung the coop , but there were tested maneuvers for countering the move . Wear all ships ! ' he signaled , and the men aboard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the heavy English battleships responded . At one moment they were headed directly into the mouth of the Chesapeake , a minute later they were jibing , and four minutes after that they had turned inside their own wake to head in precisely the opposite direction , taking a course which must produce a collision with the French ships , unless the latter bore away . By this maneuver the English regained their advantage . They had the wind off their larboard quarter ; their heavy guns bore down upon the French ; they retained the choice of movement . Watch ! ' Captain Turlock whispered to his son . You 'll never see this again . ' Majestically , ponderously the two lines of ships drew together ; at top speed they moved at less than three miles an hour , but their weight was so formidable that Matt could almost hear the crunching of spars . Each line was about five miles long . At the rear they were four miles apart , which meant that these ships would not close fast enough to participate in the battle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred yards apart ... two hundred ... a hundred ... and finally close enough for pistol shots . When are they going to firer Matt asked . Soon enough , ' his father said , and of a sudden a massive burst of flame exploded from the English ships , and cannonballs ricocheted with fearful effect across the French decks . The battle for the future of America had begun . Matt would never forget the impact of that first English salvo . Wooden cannonballs had been used in hopes they would throw jagged splintersp387through the bodies of French sailors , and that is what happened . Before the smoke had cleared , the decks of the French ships were red , and young sailors sped about with buckets of sand to help the gunners maintain their footing , but before the latter could prepare their guns , a second volley of wooden balls exploded , adding to the devastation . Why do n't they fire back ? ' Matt cried in frustration . They fight different , ' his father explained . Watch the English spars . ' And when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accomplishedlittle in disrupting the decks of their enemy , they were beginning to knock down his masts and sails . Who 's winning ? ' Matt cried . No one knows , ' his father replied , and for two agonizing hours under a dying summer sun the guns roared , and the implacable ships moved ever closer ; even pistols reverberated . The lead ships of the English line created unimaginable devastation on the French decks , already undermanned , and for a while it seemed that the French must crumble . But toward dark the terrible efficiency of their gunfire began to take its toll . Down came the soaring English masts , down fluttered the gallant sails . One English ship after another began to limp , and then to falter , and finally to fall away . It was a curious fact that in this culminating struggle of the revolution , this engagement foreseen by Washington as the one which would determineeverything , not a single American participated . Gunners from Marseille and Bordeaux took part and young officers from Kent and Sussex , but no Americans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from New Hampshire , nor sloops nor frigates from Boston . The fate of America was being determined by Frenchmen engaged in mortal collision with Englishmen . When the day ended , neither fleet had won . No colors were struck . No ship was sunk . Of course , the English admirals decided to burn the Terrible , sorely damaged , but later this was held to be a craven act . Captain Turlock , who was close enough to see the Terrible while she lay wallowing , gave it as his opinion that six watermen from the Choptank could have sailed that ship to the Channel and captured four prizes on the way . ' But she was burned . This engagement was one of the decisive battles of history , for when it terminated , with the French line of battle still impregnable , the English had to withdraw , leaving the Chesapeake open to the French fleet . Rochambeau was now able to bring thousands of French soldiers south for the final thrust against Cornwallis ; the iron blockade of the Atlantic ports was broken . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a celebration . It accomplished nothing but the freedom of America , the establishment of a new system of government against which all others would eventuallyp388compare themselves , and a revision of the theory of empire . The only American in a position to perceive these consequences as they happened was a barefooted waterman from the Choptank who watched on the morning of September 6 , 1781 , as the great ships of the English line turned slowly north in retreat . Now we can go home , ' he told Mr. Semmes . They wo n't be back . ' Among the French soldiers unloaded by Admiral de Grasse 's fleet was a young colonel bearing the illustrious name of Vauban , a collateral descendant of that Marshal Vauban who in 1705 had laid down the rules for siege warfare . Young Vauban had come to America to embellish his reputation , and was overjoyed to discover that General Cornwallis had retreated into a fortified position from which he could be expelled only by a protracted siege . Throwing himself upon General Washington , he proclaimed , Mon General , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' And before permission was granted , this energetic young man had put together a makeshift team whose bible would be Rule of Siege , a handbook compiled by himself on the principles of the great Vauban and printed in Paris . As soon as he saw where Cornwallis had holed up , he knew what had to be done . General Washington , it 's all really very simple . A classic siege . ' On his own recognizance he crossed the Chesapeake to enlist the aid of Simon Steed . ' I need an interpreter so that I can talk with the men , and you speak French . I need a hundred more workmen who can also fire rifles , and I have been told that your Choptank men are the best . ' As to the former request , Steed pointed out that he was fifty-one years old and scarcely the man for hand-to-hand combat , to which young Vauban said airily , My great-great-grandfather conducted major sieges when he was seventy . All you have to do is talk and find me a hundred men . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help of Captain Turlock , who said , Hell , we got a hundred Turlocks who love to fight . ' Actually , when he loaded the Whisper with men and ammunition , there were eleven Turlocks aboard , a collection of scoundrels so mangy that Colonel Vauban said , You 're bringing me rats . ' When Steed translated this , Turlock said , Muskrats . Wait 'll you see them dig . ' From all parts of the Eastern Shore similar contingents set out for Yorktown , and when Vauban assembled them he said in flowery exuberance , Men , we 're about to show America what a siege is . ' He wore a white-and-gold uniform which he studiously protected from smears , so that the ragged and often shoeless watermen scorned him , but when they had finished digging the trenches he devised , theyp389found to their surprise that approaches to the English fortifications had been so cleverly planned , they could move with impunity , for the English marksmen could never get a good shot at them . It became apparent to Simon Steed that General @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the action , had only to march in and take the place , and in staff meetings with General Washingtonhe said so . This infuriated Colonel Vauban . Gentlemen ! We must conduct the siege properly , ' and out came the handbook explaining how a gentleman behaved in the final stages of a siege . We must show force , ' he said , and then we must breach the wall . ' We do n't have to breach the wall , ' one of Washington 's aides protested . We can starve them out . ' Starve ! ' Vaugan exploded . Gentlemen , this is a siege ! ' And he proceeded to position his watermen outside the walls of the English fort and lead them in a manual of arms which he had devised . The men were bearded , filthy , ragged and insolent , but they went through the motions on the grounds that this one knows something . ' When English marksmenon the parapets began firing at the ragtag colonials , Vauban ignored them haughtily and continued his drill . At the conclusion he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' He told the committee of generals that according to the rules , they must now expect certain developments : General Cornwallis is obligated to try a sortie . Tonight . ' That would be suicidal ! ' a rough-shirted American general protested . But he must ! ' Vauban said . And leafing through his manual , he foundthe passage regulating the deportment of the commander being besieged : The honor of arms requires that the officer besieged make at least one honest effort to break through the lines of the besieging enemy and to inflict as much damage on the siege installations as practical . To avoid such sorties is to surrender any claim to honor . ' But we 'll shoot his ass off , ' the American said . That 's no concern of his ! ' Vauban said , aghast . It 's a matter of honor . ' Honor hell , he 's whipped . ' Such a statement was outside the pale , and Vauban ignored it . The second obligation is ours . We must attempt to breach the fortifications . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need any breach , ' the Americans argued , and they were right . With the Chesapeake under the control of Admiral de Grasse 's ships , Cornwallis was doomed . Within a week he must surrender , and breaching the fortifications was a senseless exercise , but again Vauban produced his Rule of Siege.  |p390For  the attacking general to refrain from breaching the fortifications , or at least attempting to do so , is to disclose a deficiency in honor . To win the siege with any show of dignity , he must assault the walls . ' That night , as Vauban had predicted , General Cornwallis mounted a sortie . His men marched straight into American fire , and they kept coming until they reached a battery of cannon , which they spiked . They then marched back inside their walls , and the siege continued . By noon the next day the cannon were back in operation , and only eleven Englishmenand four colonials were dead . To Vauban 's disgust , the breaching of the fortifications was not necessary . He had his men primed for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the clever trenches dug , but before the men could swing into operation , General Cornwallis surrendered . Now came Vauban'sfinest hour . The question arose as to how the English should turn over their fort and their guns to the victors , and fiery debate ensued , at the center of which stood Colonel Vauban , aided by his interpreter , Simon Steed . General Cornwallis demanded full military honors , including the traditionalright of marching his men , flags unfurled and muskets ashoulder , out through the fortifications while the English band played some American tune to show respect for the valor of those who had forced surrender . ' No ! No ! ' Vauban protested , and with Steed supporting him in a melange of French and English , he whipped out his book and turned to one of the profound passages : At the end of the siege , if it be successful , the defeated general is entitled to march his men through the walls , their flags proudly unfurled , their arms in position , and it is traditional for the band @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ march , some military tune treasured by the victors , as testimony to the valor of the assault . ' The English at the meeting jumped on this as justification for just what General Cornwallis was demanding , but now Vauban asked Steed to read the rest of that passage : But this tradition is honored only if the defeated army can march through the walls using a breach which they forced the attacking army to make . If the surrender takes place while the walls remain unbreached , this can only mean that the defenders showed a lack of determination in defending their position , and they surrender all claim to honors . They march unarmed , with flags furled . Their bandp391is not allowed to play a tune of the victors , for they have proved themselves deficient in military honor . ' After hearing these harsh words , one of the English generals leaped forward and struck the book from Steed 's hands . There was no deficiencyof honor , sir . ' But Colonel Vauban interceded . Going to the Englishman , he said , I tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they would n't help . ' He indicated the Americans . And your Cornwallis was too quick with the white flag . One more day and I would have made the breach . ' He kissed the general and retired , his eyes filled with tears , but he would not allow the English to come through the undemolished gates with military honors . Their guns were stacked , their flags were furled , and their band had to play one of their own tunes , The World Turned Upside Down . But the English generals had their revenge . That night they refused to dine , as the honors of war demanded , with the American victors . The Americans did n't defeat us . The French did . ' They dined with Rochambeauand his staff , but as they drank wine afterward Colonel Vauban said , The barefoot men I brought across the bay are a sad lot . Filled with lice , and not one of them could read . But they had their own kind of virtue . I doubt that free America will be a pleasant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Victory should have brought Simon Steed honors and rewards . It did n't . In Nantes he had served the colonies well , and in smuggling needed supplies he had been most ingenious , sacrificing four of his ships in doing so . Also , he had brought more than a hundred men to the final siege , where he had served with General Washington , and when offices were being handed out at the end of the war he felt entitled to one in which he could at least recoup the costs of his four schooners . He got nothing . There were too many rumors that he had profited outrageously from the war ; his speculation in the various paper issues was known and in some quarters grudgingly admired , for consistently he had guessed right , doubling his investments whenever he did so . But his dealing in soldiers ' scrip was another matter , for here he was making profit on the heroism of others . Actually , the charge was unfair , as the case of Wilmer Turlock proved . He had fought through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always present . He had also volunteered for the final siege at Yorktownand for his services had received a printed promise from the ContinentalCongress that at some future date he would receive $480 . The trouble began when he told his Uncle Teach , I need the money now . ' They ai n't payin ' it now . '  |p392How  'm I goin ' to get itTThere 's men buyin ' the notes on speculation , ' the captain said . WhoTSam Deats , upriver . ' Turlock had gone to Deats , a miserable man , who snarled , I 'm payin ' one for eight . ' What 's that mean ? , ' For your four-eighty I give you sixty . ' That 's robbery ! ' I did n't ask you to come here . I 'm takin ' the risk , not you . ' But Congress will pay . ' Then wait for Congress and do n't bother me . ' And when Wilmer went to other speculators , he found them offering one for ten . It was then that his uncle suggested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man but he 's honest , ' and the young soldier sailed down to the island , where Mr. Steed drew up a paper on which Wilmer made his mark : On January r9 , 1785 , I approached Simon Steed , begging him to accept my Warrant of Pay . Mr. Steed advised me three times to hold on to it , assuring me that Congress would pay , but when I said I had to have my money now , he warned me that he could pay me only one in six . I told him others were paying only one in eight or one in ten , so he took my Warrant for $48o and handed me $8o , which I willingly accepted . Steed had a pile of such receipts and they proved that he had invariably advised the young soldiers to hold on to their scrip , and then paid better than the going price . But in the end one fact stood out : because he had hard money when the soldiers had none , he had been able to buy their scrip for one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at par , as he always predicted it would , he earned six hundred-percent interest for what amounted to a loan of fourteen months . But even this tight-fisted action would not have been disqualifying ; throughout Maryland and the other new states many financiers had profited in this manner , but Simon 's case was tainted by his larger dealings with the government itself . In 1777 in the city of Nantes , BenjaminFranklin had proposed that Simon serve as purchasing agent for the fledgling government , and commissions had been issued appointing him to this post . All agreed that Steed had performed ably , smuggling in necessary supplies in his various ships . Indeed , his Whisper had become legendaryfor her feats in slipping into and out of St. Eustatius ; her contributionwas heroic , and without the sinews of battle she delivered top393Baltimore and Boston , the course of the war might have been altered . But now it was being divulged that whenever one of Steed 's schooners put in at St. Eustatius , this kind of transaction took place : Two bales of prime cordage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Same sold at Baltimore for  --  Sterling 120 . Commission to Simon Steed for procuring and handling same , 33 1/3% or  --  Sterling 40 . Thus , on one shipment of cordage costing 50 , Steed made a final profit of no . True , he took risks with the Whisper and he did have to pay the captain and crew , but even with those deductions , his profit had been stupendous . When calculations were completed , Congress found that this unassumingEastern Shore gentleman had milked the government of more than four hundred thousand pounds sterling , and his name became anathema : Richer than Simon Steed . " Patriotism for sale at six cents on the dollar . ' Any hope that he might have had for preferment in the new government vanished . He retired to Devon , living alone in the great house , spending his afternoons wandering aimlessly in the spacious wooded garden designed by his Grandmother Rosalind . The oak grew nobler with each passing decade and in autumn the pyracantha flamed . The hollies were substantialtrees now , the females laden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their master . And in the early summer when the burnt gold of daylilies flooded the banks , Simon believed that no spot in Maryland could be more handsome . At such times , when nature was so benevolent , he thought of his missing wife and daughter ; his loneliness did not make him bitter , for he understood why Jane Fithian had found rural America so distasteful , but he did sometimes indulge himself in wry amusement : She scorned us . I can serve you best by frankness . My sister is not entirely herself , despite the fact that we have given her the best care that England can provide . She slips into such furious tirades against the traitors in America that seeing you again would be disastrous . Penny thrivesUsed to ask how louts like Washington and Jefferson could presume to negotiate with a king . We negotiated . He missed Penny . Each year during the long war  --  nine of them , from 1775 through ' 83  --  he had managed somehow to deliver into England letters of credit upon which his wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in return had been one silhouette showing a child of five wearing pigtails . He had sent it to Annapolis to be encased in gold , and now it hung on a chain near his bed . Often since the end of war he had contemplated quitting Maryland altogether and going to England to live with his family , or perhaps taking them to France , but after consulting by mail with Guy Fithian he rejectedthat plan , because the factor wrote :  |p394and  gives no evidence of following her mother into partial but heartbreaking insanity . She loves you for the money you send each year . When he reflected on this painful situation he sometimes thought that he had been taxed too heavily for his patriotism : he had lost his wife , his daughter , his nephew , his fleet and his honor . How lonely he became , holding more than two hundred thousand pounds sterling and only God knew how many livres tournois and Spanishdoubloons and Portuguese big foes . Two or three times a year he would entertain at Rosalind 's Revenge , and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Creek , and slaves would carry portmanteaus to the big rooms and the two wings would be filled , and forty would sit down to dinner in that splendid dining hall erected by Rosalind Janney Steed , and Simon would preside , listening to the small talk but not engaging in it . Early on the morning of Wednesday , April 15 , 1789 , a gentleman in uniform named Major Lee hurried down to the dock at Mount Vernon in Virginia , where two rowers were waiting to ferry him across the Potomac River . As soon as they deposited him on the Maryland shore he ran to where two other men in military uniform were waiting with fresh horses . Major Lee vaulted into his saddle and set off in a gallop for Annapolis . At every inn or crossroads church where people might be gathered , he called out the exciting news , General Washington 's to be our President . ' Invariably , cheers rose from the listeners , and as he dashed on , Lee could see the Marylanders scattering to inform their neighbors of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have made any sense on that historic day . Who but Washington had the measure of acceptance and skill required to launch the new Constitution ? At the state house in Annapolis , Major Lee discovered , to his pique , that news of the election had already been disseminated , but he was pleased to observe the cheering crowds who came out to greet him as a messenger who had actually seen Washington at Mount Vernon . He 'll stop by here tomorrow on his way to the capital , ' Lee assured his listeners . He begins his reign as soon as he takes the oath in New York . ' But Major Lee had not ridden from Mount Vernon in order to conversewith the politicians of Annapolis . After congratulating them on the way in which their representatives had helped select the new President , he spurred his horse to the dock , where a pinnace manned by four sailors waited . Jumping in , he directed the men , Down to Devon Island . Quick . '  |p395The  sailors raised small sails on the two short masts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was chancy and even after they had cleared the mole guarding the harbor they made only fitful progress , and nightfall found them drifting aimlessly on the broad expanse of the Chesapeake . Stars appeared occasionally , dim and distant above the flapping canvas , but no wind rose to help them make the crossing . At four in the morning Major Lee asked the captain of the pinnace , Shall we rowT and the captain studied the situation , looking into the darkness in all directions . Before committing his men to the ugly chore , he asked , Will we be sailing north immediatel  --  ' We spend only a few hours at Devon . Then north . ' Then I wo n't ask the men to row out of the calm . The wind will rise . ' But whenT Lee asked in the darkness . It will rise , ' the officer assured him . So Lee fretted through the long night , and at five-thirty , when light was beginning to show in the east , he fell asleep . When he woke , the day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the northwest . The captain of the pinnace did not say , I told you so . ' He was satisfied that his men had escaped the job of rowing that heavy boat out of the doldrums . It was eight in the morning when the pinnace sighted Devon , and as soon as it entered the creek slaves hailed its arrival , shouting , Master ! Master ! ' but imparting no specific news . When the pinnace worked its way up to the Steed wharf some thirty persons waited to greet the major , who ignored them , pushed his way through , and ran up to Simon Steed , embracing him . General Washington sends his regards . He 's to be our new President ! ' A cheer rose from whites and blacks at this reassuring news , and Steed nodded gravely , as if the cheers had been intended for him . To the crowd he said , How could we have chosen any other ? ' and they all cheered again . Major Lee brought heady news : The general is crossing from Annapolisto Chestertown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to New York and his new duties . ' As these words were said , Steed felt a glow of renewed confidence ; doubtless the new President had decided upon some position of significance for his Eastern Shore deputy . And as the crowd milled about Major Lee , seeking added information , Steed withdrew , as if in a trance , speculating on what his responsibility might be : I 've worked with ships all my life and could handle the navy . Or I 'd be adequate in some post dealing with commerce or the nation 's money . His reverie was broken when Lee tugged on his arm . The general wants Paxmore and Turlock , too . ' This diluted sharply the intimacy of the meeting , and Steed asked inp396some dismay , Shall we be going in your boatT and Lee further dampenedthe excitement by saying , No , I 'm to pick up some others on the way , ' and Steed thought to himself . It 's not to be a meeting . It 's a convention . I 'll ready my sloop at once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Be sure to fetch Paxmore and Turlock . ' Simon broke out a small boat and sailed directly to Peace Cliff , where he informed Paxmore of the meeting , and together they sailed to the marshes . At first they had difficulty finding the entrance to the myriad streams that segmented the marsh , but Paxmore remembered certain landmarks that led to Turlock Creek , which they penetrated cautiously , as if trying to avoid an ambuscade . Through the years men along the Eastern Shore had learned to approach this place with care . Halloo ! ' one of Steed 's sailors called . There was no response . Call again , ' Steed ordered , but the slave was reluctant to do anything that might anger those hiding in the marsh . Give the call ! ' Steed commanded . Halloo ! ' the slave trumpeted , and the echo had barely died when a shot rang out . The men in the boat could hear the pellets rip through the dried grass . Stop where you are ! ' a ghostly voice warned . Captain Turlock ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' A second shot ripped through the grass and this angered Steed . Damn it , man ! President Washington wants to meet you . In Chestertown . ' From the marsh a disembodied voice called , Cap 'm Turlock , he ai n't here . ' Where is heT Steed called into the emptiness . On the porch . ' And from the grass appeared a lanky youth of nineteen , carrying a musket , a marsh dog at his heel . He wore few clothes , no shoes , no hat . He was a surly waterman , but when he saw Steed his begrimed face broke into a broad smile and he said , I knowed you at Yorktown . ' Did you fight ther  --  ' Did n't fight . Wore my ass off diggin ' trenches . ' Where 's Teach ? ' Steed asked , and the young man led the way through devious trails to the cabin . There , barefooted , dressed in patched homespun , scratching his beard , sat the man who had terrorized the Caribbean . Mr. Steed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wants us to visit with him in Chestertown . ' Whe  --  ' Tonight . ' We better get movin ' , ' and the grizzled captain left the porch , spent a few minutes inside the cabin , and reappeared in a passable costume :  |p397baggy  homespun trousers , heavy shirt woven from flax and cotton , shoes made from muskrat skins and a coonskin hat . He showed the Steed slaves a shortcut through the marsh , and within an hour the three men were aboard the sloop , heading northwest for Knapps Narrows , where Steed announced the news to the people of Bay Hundred . Once in the Chesapeake , they sped north for the difficult passage at Kent Narrows , proposing to reach Chestertown at about the same time that Washington would be landing for his overnight stop . But bad luck overtook them in the lee of Kent Island ; the brisk wind was masked by trees , and a whole afternoon was idled away , with Steed growing more and more impatient . Ca n't you move this boatTThe men could try rowing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accomplished little , and the day ended with the Choptank men wasting their time at the mouth of the Chester River , while the new President celebrated with friends in Chestertown . At dawn the next morning Steed was beside himself with frustration . Can we get horses ? ' he asked his captain . No horses , no roads . ' Well , damn this wind . ' It was ten in the morning before the trio reached Chestertown , and as Steed had feared , Washington had left at dawn for Warwick , the next stopping place on the way to New York . Steed asked the innkeeper if three horses could be found , and the man replied , Washington 's men took ' em all . ' Find some ! ' Steed commanded . Who 's to payTI 'll pay . ' And who are yourSimon Steed of Devon . ' The innkeeper nodded and said , ' In that case the farmers may have something . ' Get them here . ' So the innkeeper sent two of his helpers to round up some horses , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full for the unlikely beasts . They were not for hire . I 'll buy them , ' Steed said , but Levin Paxmore would not allow this . Thee is charging outrageous prices , ' he remonstrated as the two farmers stared at him . Mr. Steed requires these horses to overtake General Washington ... for a most important meet-ing . ' One of the farmers pointed at Teach Turlock and grinned . He 's goin ' to see Washington ? ' He is , ' Paxmore said quietly . He was a notable fighter in the late war . ' What 's ' is nameTp398Teach Turlock . ' The farmers gaped , then began shouting to bystanders , Hey , this is Teach Turlock ! ' And they grabbed the captain 's hand , shouting excitedly , You damned near burned up this bay with the Whisper . Captain Turlock , you were a mighty man . ' And one of the farmers said , If you want to rent horses , Turlock , you can sure rent ' em from us , ' and the three Choptank men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they crossed the Sassafras River , galloped north to Cecilton , then followed a mean and dusty road into Warwick , where crowds of farming people clustered at the crossroads . Where 's the general ? ' Steed asked . He 's stopping at the Heath place . ' I saw him ride in , ' a woman said reverently , and children shouted , He 's sleepin ' in that house . ' In the road , his arms crossed , stood Major Lee , protecting the farmhousein which his general slept . When Steed rode up , the major indicatedthat he must dismount and leave his horse behind . We missed you , ' he said . Damned wind . ' Yes , it started to die just as we cleared the Narrows . ' Slept standing up , cursing the wind , ' Steed explained . The general will be pleased you came . He asked for you repeatedly . ' At this gratifying news Steed beamed , but what Lee said next deflated him . The general yearns for a good card game , and when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleep on the bench , Steed . He may want to play all night . ' This kind of visit was not what Simon had envisaged . Indeed , through the long windless night he had rehearsed the topics he wished to discuss with the new President , and cardplaying was not one of them . But he was determined to accomplish two goals on this trip : to present himself in the best possible light , and to nail down some assurances as to how the Eastern Shore was to be governed . Accordingly , he did not accept the bench offered by the major ; instead he carried his canvas bag out to the wash house , where he soaped down , combed , touched himself with perfume and donned fresh clothes . When he was finished he presented the fine figure of a fifty-nine-year-old patriot eager to serve in whatever capacity the new President might determine . Washington did not arise till about six-thirty in the evening , at which time Major Lee informed him that the Choptank men had arrived . Without attending to his dress , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at attention and acknowledged him briefly , then spotted Levin Paxmore , the shipbuilder , and hurried to him . Graspinghis fire-scarred hands , Washington said , What sturdy ships you build . '  |p399Four  of them ended fighting for the English . ' Ah , but the Whisper that fought for us helped determine the battle . Keep your hat , Friend Paxmore . You 've earned the privilege . ' He then spotted Captain Turlock and stood before him admiringly , hands on hips , unable to speak . Finally he grasped the waterman by the shoulders , pressed them vigorously and said , I confess a special fondness for brave men , ' and he began to recite some of the adventures Turlock had experienced . They almost trapped you at St. Eustatius , did n't the  --  ' They did get my sister ship . That was a sore defeat . ' We 've all had them , ' Washington said . You should be an admiral , sir . ' I ca n't read or write , ' Turlock replied . Washington laughed and asked , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' , ' Turlock said , and Washington guffawed . Major Lee ! ' he called in a resounding voice . Take note of this man , and note him well . The only one in America who does n't seek an appointment . ' He laughed again , then bowed deeply , adding , You were mosthelpful , Captain . ' Then he returned to Colonel Steed , saying heartily , Damned glad you overtook us , Steed . I am most hungry for some cards . ' And he led the way to a small room which Major Lee had arranged for this night . It contained a table , six chairs , two lamps on high stands and three spittoons . Two planters from the Warwick area had been waiting since five and were eager for the game to start . A Colonel Witherspoon who was riding with Washington took a chair , but when the general and Steed sat down , there remained one empty space . I do like six to a game , ' Washington said . Friend Paxmore , would you take a hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . How about Major Lee ? ' Steed asked . I will not allow him to lose any further , ' Washington said . Colonel Witherspoon pointed at Captain Turlock . Do you pla  --  ' Some . ' Sit down , ' and Turlock took the sixth chair . When the first hand was dealt he looked at his cards and muttered , Jesus Christ ! ' Washington stopped arranging his cards and stared at the swamp man , and Colonel Witherspoon said reprovingly , We do n't use oaths , Captain Turlock . ' You would if you saw these cards , ' Turlock replied , and Washington smiled . After the third hand the general said graciously , Steed , I am gratified to an extent I can not express that you have seen fit to visit with us . One of my first tasks in New York will be to ask the Congress to recompense you for your lost ships . ' I would be grateful , ' Steed said , and then he waited , knowing that thisp400was the moment in which the new President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government , but nothing was said , and Turlock ruptured the spell by grunting , Your deal , General . ' As midnight approached , Major Lee led Levin Paxmore out of the house and onto the roadway , where they talked for some hours , while the locals sat along the road , watching the house where their beloved hero was meeting in high consultation with the leaders of the region . Gad , how I 'd love to be in that game , ' Lee confessed . Thee likes cards so much ? ' I 'm a fanatic , but I seem always to lose , and the general 's forbidden me to play . ' They walked along the dark road for some minutes , then Lee said , Of course , he always loses too . But he says the difference is he can afford it . ' Does he play so much ? ' Before the war , almost every night . He kept an account book of each night 's play , and it shows that he lost heavily . During the war I never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Valley Forge . And of course he lost . He 'll lose tonight , you can be sure of that , and I 'll enter it in the book . Chestertown , lost three pounds , sixteen shillings , nine pence . ' This is Warwick . ' They all seem the same . We approach the towns . The people storm out . They drown him with adulation . This land has never seen a hero like Washington , nor will again . ' Is he so fine ? ' Paxmore asked . You saw him . Six feet four . He towers above ordinary men . ' I mean morally . ' He puzzles me , ' Lee confessed . He places his whole destiny in the hands of God , serves Him with devotion . But like a soldier , not a puling clergyman . ' In the darkness Major Lee permitted silence to indicate his confusion . Will he make a good President ? ' The finest . No man could prove his equal . He stands alone , a monument to integrity . ' Another pause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of course , that he gained enormous approval by his refusal to accept any salary as general of the colonial armies . That 's right , never accepted a shilling of pay . Said over and over that a patriot should serve his country in time of danger and pay no heed to the cost . ' That was admirable , ' Paxmore said , but he did not point out that in the dark days of the war he had built three ships for the Continental navy , in addition to those for Steed , and that since the revolutionaries had had no funds , he had borne most of the cost himself . Also , his boatyard had been burned and his best workmen conscripted into the army.  |p401Even  had he enjoyed cards , he would not have dared to play this night , for the war had left him largely impoverished ; but to learn that General Washington had also served without pay was heartening . But then Major Lee added , What Washington did was refuse a salary but demand an expense account . I helped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his son 's expenses , wine for the mess , a carriage for himself and four more carriages for his friends , rations , guns , braid for his jackets , axes for the woods . Thinking back on those accounts , they were extraordi-nary . ' I could make out such an account for my shipyard , ' Paxmore said , and would do so , if asked . ' Yes , ' Lee conceded . Each item submitted was an honest figure . But whether some of them should have been submitted remains dubious . All I know is that when there was talk of Washington 's becoming President , he again volunteered to serve without pay just expenses . And the committeetold him with some firmness , " Oh no , sir ! This time you must accept a salary ! " They told me later , " No new nation could survive another of his damned expense accounts . " ' They now turned and walked back down the road past the house where the players were intent on their cards . They could see General Washington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just dealt , and Paxmore asked , Is he capable of governing ? I mean , soldiers are sometimes both obstinate and deficient in knowledge . ' He 's not read much , ' Lee confided . I rarely see him with a book . He 's certainly no Adams or Jefferson , but maybe they read too much . ' Up and down the silent road they walked , touching upon all aspects of the new position that Washington was moving into : the military appointments , the finances , the judgeships , the building up of a merchant navy , the admission of new states carved out of the western lands , the entire gamut of government  --  while the general continued playing cards . I never knew my father , ' Lee confided toward two in the morning . So perhaps my good opinion of the general is weighted in his favor . But I 've served with him since I was a boy in 1774 , and no finer man ever walked on the soil of this continent . He may not prove to be a capable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And he 'll provide a symbol , stronger and brighter every year . ' He reflected on this , and after they had passed the cardplayers again he said , At the meetings related to the revolution we had many fine orators , and I heard most of them . I never heard a finer intellect than that stubby little lawyer from Philadelphia , James Wilson . Ben Franklin could make a point , too , and John Adams could be devastating . But the best speech I ever heard was given by George Washington , who never said much . It was in 1774 , I think , when the British were bombarding Boston andp402we in the south did n't know how to respond . That day the oratory contained much fire and more confusion , but when everything seemed to be lost in chaos , Washington  --  I think he was only a colonel then . . . ' He hesitated . Virginia militia , it must have been . Anyway , when it seemed that we must allow Boston to fight alone , this man stood up and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he sat down the whole history of the colonies was changed . ' What did he say ? ' " Gentlemen , I will raise one thousand men , outfit and pay them at my own expense , and march myself at their head for the relief of Boston . " ' Paxmore said , I think I need sleep . I shall be going inside . ' Major Lee said , ' I ' 11 keep guard out here . ' When Paxmore entered the gaming room it was half after three and Teach Turlock had only a few shillings on the table . If you president as well as you play cards , ' he said admiringly to Washington , this country will be all right . ' Turlock lost that hand and decided to quit the game . Come on , Friend Paxmore , ' he said , we 'll catch some sleep . ' And he lay down on the floor outside the door while the Quaker made his way to a back room where a dozen men were stretched out . Now came the part that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning , deadly quiet in all parts of the night except in this room where the candles flickered . The game was down to just four players , one of the local landowners having dropped out , and each surviving player knew the established peculiarities of the others . Simon Steed played an absolutely straightforward game , no bluff . Colonel Witherspoonplayed for every advantage , studied each card , each adversary with minute attention and won more than his share of hands . The planter was a good player , willing to take extraordinary risks if he detected even a slight edge in his favor . And General Washington was proving himself to be what he always had been : a cautious , stubborn defender of his shillings , a niggardly man when it came to betting , a daring man when he saw a chance to win a big pot , but so transparent in his positions that he was destined always to lose if the game continued long enough . Your majesty , ' Steed said at five in the morning , I think I have the better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that appellation , ' Washington replied , holding his losing cards close to his sweaty shirt . Sire , this country yearns for royal trappings , ' Steed insisted . I prefer mister . ' The people will not permit it . Believe me , Sire , we Americans may have thrown out one set of royalty , but we are most hungry to adopt another . . . a better , that is . And you 're that better . ' Washington tapped his chin with his cards . Others have said what youp403say , Steed , and there 's much common sense in what you advise . It may well be that in the end we shall have to have a royalty . But in this game you must not address a man as Sire when you intend to cut his throat . What cards are you hiding against me , Steed of Devon ? ' The game broke up at a quarter to six . Major Lee , hearing the commotion , came to the door of the room to announce , The horses are ready , sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wilmington , ' Washington replied . Shall we take thirty minutes to wash up , Witherspoon ? ' Did you lose again ? ' Lee asked impishly . You can mark me down in the book , ' Washington replied , as having lost two pounds , twelve and three . ' Warwick has proved costly , ' Lee said . It was worth it to meet once more my comrade in arms at Yorktown , ' Washington said , throwing his long right arm about Steed 's shoulder , and with that , he retired to the washhouse . There would be no confidentialtalk of government position , but Washington was not an unfeeling man and when he returned from his toilet and saw the bleak look on Steed 's face , he went to him , took him by the hand and said bluntly , My dear friend , I would give an arm to have you at my side . ' He paused . But the scandals . Impossible . Impossible . ' And he marched to the horses . But before he reached them he was stopped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a paper which he had cherished since 1776 ; it was the Rector of Wrentham 's cession of Turlock 's hundred acres . Please , General Washington , restore my land . ' The President studied the paper , asked Turlock and Steed a few questions , then called for Major Lee to bring him a quill . Sitting on a bench at the door to the farmhouse he added this endorsement to the precious document : To my old comrade in arms , Governor John Eager HowardRarely have I seen a document so shot through with fraud and force and forgery as this , but rarely have I heard supporting evidence from reliable witnesses as solid as that which bulwarks this claim . I pray you , lend good ear to the supplication of the Patriot , Teach Turlock , that his lands be restored . Geo . WashingtonIn the roadway a throng of hundreds waited to applaud their hero , and in his red-and-blue riding coat he made a handsome figure , bowing gravely right and left . Major Lee provided a small stool to help him mount , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked more noble than ever . Great wishes , Sire , ' Steed called , tears beginning to form.  |p404We  shall face difficult tasks , all of us , ' Washington said as he rode off , attended by cheers that would not cease till he reached New York . The three Choptank men , without having consulted one another , mounted their horses and followed for some miles as if drawn by a powerful magnet . When the time came to turn back , Major Lee rode up to bid them farewell . To Steed he said , The general asked me to say that you will have access to him as long as you both shall live . He prizes you as one of the true servants of this nation . ' But to Levin Paxmore he whispered , as their horses moved in the early sunlight , I spoke perhaps too freely under the stars . You 'll keep what I said confidential ? ' I shall honor thy request , ' Paxmore said , whereupon Lee pressed into the Quaker 's hand a personal communication from Washington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his desk at the boatyard . Then carefully he unfolded the paper , spread it smoothly , and read : Friend PaxmoreYou must submit at your earliest convenience a true accounting of the costs you incurred in building ships for our cause , less whatever funds were advanced you by the Congress . And I shall do my best to see that you are paid in full , because all free men stand in your debt . Geo . WashingtonThat day Levin Paxmore compiled an honest account of every shilling he had spent on the revolution , including the replacement of his sheds and a wage for his wife , and when President Washington signed the authorizing bill , Paxmore was paid in full , and it was this military money that formed the foundation of the Paxmore fortune.  |p405WINTER  ALONG THE EASTERN SHORE WAS USUallyclement . An occasional freezing of some salt-free river , or a desultoryfall of snow which soon melted , indicated that winter was at hand , but because of the modifying effects of both the Atlantic and the Chesapeake , temperatures never dropped very low . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some inches , and farmers along the shore stayed indoors until it passed . Thomas Applegarth , twenty-seven years old , unmarried , tenant on a farm near Patamokeowned by the Steeds , used these days of enforced idleness to study a book lent him by Elizabeth Paxmore , for whom he sometimes did odd jobs . It was a geography of the eastern states , and what impressed him was the manner in which the mountains of Pennsylvania drifted in a marked direction from northeast to southwest . Even the dullest mind would have deduced , from this new map , that some extraordinary force had determined the lay of these mountains , but what that might have been , Applegarth had not enough training to detect . Yet as he studied the map he vaguely recalled something he had read recently about events that had occurred long ago in Europe , but what precisely they were he could not remember . And then , toward dusk , as it came time for him to tend the cattle , he put down his book , went out and walked along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did so he came upon a small accumulation of ice under a tree , and suddenly the whole mystery of the Pennsylvania mountains and the formation of the Chesapeakebecame clear to him , as if someone had struck a monstrous match in a darkened valley : Ice ! That 's what it was that scarred the mountains of Europe . And that 's what dug out our valleys in America ! He could not grasp what an ice age was , nor the vastness of the sheetp406that had at one time lain over Pennsylvania , but he saw clearly one fact : that the ice sheet must have contained within it an enormous quantity of water , and when the ice finally melted , that water must have formed a gigantic river , parent to the present Susquehanna . And that river , nothing else , had reamed out the Chesapeake Bay and deposited the silt which had become , in time , the Eastern Shore . His concept was so grand , and its parts fell together so neatly , that as he milked the cows in the shadows thrown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That 's how it must have happened , ' he whispered to himself . The world up north was imprisoned under a mantle of ice , and when it melted , it scarred the mountains and filled the valleys with tremendous rivers . ' The idea so preoccupied him that on the first clear day he drove down to Peace Cliff to return Mrs. Paxmore 's book and ask her whether she believed it was possible for America to have experienced an age of ice . A what ? ' she asked . I read that northern Europe  --  well , this was long ago  --  it had ice on it . ' I suppose Russia has ice every year , ' she said . No , this book said that the entire land had ice hundreds of feet thick . . . all over it . ' Nothing could have lived , ' she protested . That 's exactly it , ' Applegarth said . The ice had to be very thick to gouge out the valleys . ' To what ? ' Have you ever looked at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never been to Pennsylvania . ' I mean a map . ' I 've never seen a map of Pennsylvania . ' There 's one here in your book . ' There is ? ' It irritated the Quaker woman to think that there could be either maps or ideas with which she was not familiar , and she took the book from Applegarth rather rudely and thumbed through it . Why , so there is , ' she said , and she studied the map with care . See how the mountains all run in the same direction ? ' the farmer said . What 's that signify ? ' They were gouged out by a heavy layer of ice moving southwest . ' The idea was so novel that Mrs. Paxmore had nothing in her past reflection by which to judge it , but she was one of those Quaker women to whom all knowledge was important , so she stood firmly on her left foot , with her right cocked at an angle , and considered the remarkable thesis that her odd job man was proposing , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reasonable they became . It could have happened that way , ' she said.  |p407And  if it did , ' Applegarth continued , then the whole valley of the Susquehanna , as we know it today . . . Well , it must have been a stupendous river . A hundred times bigger than we see it . ' With a solid finger he outlined on the map the principal features of his theory , coming at last to the Chesapeake itself . Our bay must have been the mouth of that immense river . What do you think of that ? ' In the weeks that followed , and during the long winter nights , Thomas Applegarth and Elizabeth Paxmore studied whatever they could find about ice ages and mountains ; they found little . Speculation about the formation of earth features had only just begun in the United States ; the fascinating revelations which were being evolved in Europe could not have been known in Patamoke , but one day Mrs. Paxmore did turn up an interesting piece of information . A professor of moral philosophy at Yale University @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up with the interesting concept that a river like the Hudson in New York could best be understood as a drowned river valley . ' The phrase captivated Mrs. Paxmore and she discussed it with her husband . Is n't that a splendid imagination ? A river valley which has been drowned , inundated by the sea ! ' Sounds to me like a sad misuse of words , ' her husband said . A pig can drown . Or a little boy who falls out of his canoe . Because they stop breathing and are drowned . But how could a river drown ? Tell me that . ' It does n't drown , ' she replied . It is drowned . ' George Paxmore leaned back to consider this foray into logic . Then , with a brusque wave of his hand , he dismissed the Yale professor , the Hudson River and the Chesapeake . No educated man would condone such grammar . ' But when Mrs. Paxmore brought her new theory to her odd job man , he visualized its application immediately . It 's what happened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when the ice had mostly melted , the river would begin to lose its force , and the ocean would creep in , and the river mouth would be drowned under the weight of salt water . ' It was a concept so intellectually beautiful , and so respondent to observable facts , that it seemed the clincher to previous speculations . He now saw the Susquehanna system in grand design , the remnant of a river which had once drained a major portion of an ice-laden continent , a majestic river which in the end had seen itself overcome by the ever-encroaching sea . He resolved to look into this matter further , when spring came . Mrs. Paxmore , whose geography book had launched these speculations , pursued her own investigations , looking into all the books she could find and talking rather obsessively to those members of the communitybetter informed than she . She was surprised one evening when her husband pushed back from the table and said , Thee may have beenp408right , Elizabeth . I 've been studying our bay . . . Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interesting thesis thee propounded some weeks back . And the more I contemplate , the more I have to conclude that thee has hit upon something . ' He outlined the steps of this thinking : that if the ancient river had indeed been drowned , the resulting bay would be determined partly by the river and partly by the ocean , rather than entirely by the latter . This would mean that there ought to be an orderly progression from entirely fresh water at the mouth of the Susquehanna , where it debouched into the bay , to entirely salt water at the spot where the bay debouched into the sea . And that 's what I find , ' he concluded . Most interesting . ' Thomas Applegarth has been talking about making an expedition to the headwaters of the Susquehanna , ' she said . I think we ought to help him . ' We could give him time off . Find some other handyman . ' I mean with money . ' George Paxmore formed his hands into a little cathedral and contemplatedthem for some time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all by a Quaker . His wife was making a serious proposal , but it was sensible . Knowledge must always be pursued . I think we could let him have twenty-five dollars , ' he said . Does thee want to tell him ? ' I think thee should . It 's been thee who has encouraged him . ' Elizabeth decided that they should both inform their handyman that their family would like to support his scientific investigations to the extent of twenty-five dollars . He was unprepared for this bonanza and for some moments could not respond . Then he said , I have fifteen of my own , and I can save at least twenty more by the end of February . I 'd like to see the upper river before the snow has melted . ' So on the first of March , 18i1 , Thomas Applegath , a farmer of Patamokeon the Eastern Shore , took off in a small sloop and headed for the present mouth of the Susquehanna River . The winds were not propitious , and he required three days to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the owner of a shipyard , and with sixty-three dollars in his pocket , started his exploration of the river . For fifty cents he employed a man with a canoe to take him as far north as the turbulent rapids at Conowingo . At this point he allowed the canoeist to return home , while he struck out on foot along the left bank of the river , that is , the one to the east . Frequently he was forced to leave the river , for the going was too rough , and on some nights he slept quite a few miles inland from the banks . But whenever he was able to walk alongside the river itself , or plunge into its icy waters for a cleansing bath , he felt himself to be in some mysterious way purified and closer to the secrets of the past . At thep409infrequent ferries he would ask to help the rowers , spending whole days moving from shore to shore , so that by the time he reached the first important ferry at Columbia he was a practiced riverman . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and got into the mountainous section of Pennsylvania that he began to see the evidences he sought . It was clear to him that in times past this mighty river had been ten or fifteen times as wide as it now was ; proof existed in the flat , smooth benchlands stretching east and west from its banks . Surely they had once been the bed of that mighty , long-vanished stream which had carried away the waters of the melting ice . Each day was a revelation , a proof . When he reached Sunbury , 215 miles from Patamoke , he faced a difficult decision , for north of that settlement were two Susquehanna Rivers . One would take him west to Williamsport , the other east to Wilkes-Barre , and no one whom he consulted could tell him definitely which was the senior river . To his amazement , no settler in Sunbury had explored to the headwaters of either . Which throws the bigger body of water ? ' he asked . Come a flood , either does right smart , ' the most knowledgeable man replied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ branch would you take ? ' I ai n't goin ' . ' But which would you guess ? ' It do n't concern me . ' He located a woman who said , In times of freshet , the east branch seems to bring down the biggest trees  --  liken as if it had come the longest distance . ' Or it came through the most wooded land . ' I was takin ' that into my calculations , ' she said . Since this was the only substantial evidence he had uncovered , he said , That sounds sensible . I 'll go east . ' So on the last day of March , Applegarth started the long , difficult journey to Wilkes-Barre , and from there , north to the Indian settlement at Tunkhannock . The going was extremely rough ; no boats were able to move upstream , and for long distances there was no road beside the river . For three days he struggled through uncut forests , determined to stay with the river , but in the end he had to abandon this resolve and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they led him . He felt as if he were exploring virgin land , and sometimes when he had been distant from the river for several days , he would come upon it rushing southward , and he would cry aloud with joy at having discoveredan old friend : There you are ! Beautiful river , holder of secrets ! ' He would take off his coat and shoes and step into the waters , and sometimes they would feel so enticing that he would plunge in , **38;4966;TOOLONG curled on a mat like a newborn while her mother-in-law touched her lips with milk symbolic of her own . Bini watched this awestruck by its implication of a solemn continuum of women , above him , around him , always . And he remembered how the shaved skull thrust forward Kadongolimi'sface , the insolent long jaw , the heavy lips like numb , dangerous fruit . He remembered her ears , then delicate and perforated to receive only the smallest rods of gold . And in their own hut her soft muffled salty smell , and her genitals simple as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the blows of her pounding millet to meal , for him , her husband . Sun shuddered in the heaved fan of chaff . The depth of lost time made him dizzy ; he stood , spitting out the twig . His thighs ached , their muscles stretched by the unaccustomedsquat . Kadongolimi , too , met resistance , seeking to arise . The naked girl , who had been standing unnoticed in the shadows , stepped forward ; Ellellou , startled by the motion , turned his head , and his gaze was splashed by the sun-saturated bougainvilleathe vanished colonists had planted in the patio , now gone wild . He and the girl raised Kadongolimi to her feet ; the woman gasped , astonished to find her spirit wrapped in so much inertia , in the weight that sagged as if to crack his arms and shoulders and then swayed away onto the slender girl , whose breasts were the shape of freshly started anthills . " Tell me , " Ellellou whispered to his wife , " is she not ours ? " " Oh , Bini , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her words . " You are the father of us all . What mattersthe paternity of this good child ? You yourself were born of a whirlwind . She loves you . We love you . In this house you will be welcome when all else crumbles . Only be not too long . In your absence , weeds spring up . Even the earth forgets . "  |p101One  bright day Ellellou , walking the streets in the stiff blue disguise of a government messenger boy , saw , along one of the narrow sandy lanes that zigzagged down from Hurriyah , a Muslim woman wearing freaky sunglasses . Unlike his severe NoIRs , they were round-square in shape , oversized , attached to the temples below center , and more darkly tinted at the top of the lens than at the bottom . Otherwise she was wearing the traditional black buibui of Muslim women , thong sandals , and a veil . She disappeared into a doorway before Ellellou could halt her and ask at what illegal and subversive market she had made her purchase . He would have cited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the truth continues to blaze . In the void created by her vanishing there blossomed then the memory of a tree of sunglasses he had seen when new in the land of the devils , in 1954 , he a young deserter enrolled as a special student at a liberal arts college in the optimistic city of Franchise , Wisconsin . He had wandered on that Septemberday , its slanting sunlight peppered with sprinkles of scarlet in the ponderous green of these North American trees , among a thousand white students , through the questionnaires and queues of college enrollment , and across the wide main street , as a-whirl with traffic as a dance of knives , to the awninged bookstore , where in accordance with his course requirements he loaded up with Tom Paine , the Federalist papers , the Arthur Schlesingers , a typographically frenzied scrapbook of masterly American prose , a lethally heavy economicstext in a falsely smiling cover of waxen blue , and empty notebooks that he himself was to scribble full of lecturedwisdom , their covers mottled like long-rotten wood and their pages suggesting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him thirsty . From under the awning next to the bookstore he glimpsed through a wide pane of **25;5006;TOOLONG , above a jumble of faded cardboard totems , a counter that promised some kind of drink , perhaps a silveryp102arak or , in accordance with the symbols advertising sun-tan lotion , palm wine . Helicon was not then the devout and abstemiousMuslim he became . He entered . The hazards and betrayals of military service and his remarkable flight , which had taken him from Dakar , where he was to have been reassignedto the Algerian struggle , to Marseilles and then London and Toronto , where he was hidden in the French-speaking ghetto behind Queen Street , had not prepared him for the interior of this American drugstore , these walls and racks crowded with intensely captive spirits , passionate , bright , and shrill , their cries for the release of purchase multiplied by the systematic madness of industrial plenty . Boxes contained little jars , little jars contained capsules , capsules contained powders and fluids that contained relief , catharsis , magic so potent , as advertised by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his face . In another area there were intricate instruments , sealed upon cardboard with transparent bubbles , for the plucking and curling and indeed torturing of female hair , and next to these implements blunt-nosed scissors , children 's crayons , paper punches and yo-yos and , farther on , rows of Mars Bars and Good ' n ' Plenties and Milky Ways laid to bed in box after box proximate to a rack of toothbrushes , dental floss , and abrasive ointments phallically packaged and chemically fortified to resist the very decay that these celestial candies , marshalled inexorably as soldiers on a parade ground , were manufactured to generate . Hakim 's instinct was to smash , to disarray this multifaceted machine , this drugstore , so unlike the chaste and arcane pharmacies of Caillieville , where the sallow Frenchman in his lime-green smock guarded his goods behind a chest-high counter showing only a few phials of colored water . This place was more like a witch 's hut of murky oddments hurled to infinity by omnipresent mirrors , even mirrors overhead , circular suspended convex mirrorsp103which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they shuffled along these artificially cooled aisles like drugged worshippers selecting a pious trinket or potion from the garish variety of aids to self-worship . Sickly music flowed from invisible tubes in the walls . Hakim , in the loose brown suit of an overweight separatist who ran a bistro in colonized Ontario , paused before an upright rack of tall cards , vulgar and facetious , yet which these U.S. indigenes in their ancient freedom were apparently meant to mail to one another in ritualized insult ; many of the cards had a tactile element , a piece of fuzz glued to a bit of cartoon clothing , a passage of cardboard raised in the manner of hammered trays from Baghdad , and even , in some of the cards , a hole that appeared to reveal something indecent ( un derriere ) , which , when one opened the card , was revealed as something innocuous ( a plate of pink ice cream ) . " Do n't touch . " " Pardon ? " He identified the voice as arising in the loose-skinned throat of a scrawny besmocked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ non-tropical skin disease . " Hands off , young fella . Get those cards dirty , they ai n't worth nothin ' to nobody . " " Je vois . " Dirty ? Moving away , he nearly bumped into a tree of sunglasses . Less a tree , in truth , than a bush , the height of a man , armored in many dark eyes . The whole thing sluggishly , unsteadily rotated . Bini , the future Ellellou , quickly put his dirty hands behind his back , to display to the querulous attendant that it was not he who was touching this prodigious , fragile array , causing it to tremble . It was , he saw , a young white woman on the other side . With impatient authoritative jerks of her slender bare arms she was pushing at the rack to make it disgorge the , for her , ideal pair of sunglasses . Shep104plucked out a pair with flared tinsel frames , set them deftly but rather roughly on her thin-lipped , decisive face , and sharply asked Hakim , " Whaddeya think ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he realized she was addressing him . She replaced the frames , not in the slot where she had found them , and seized a pair with rims of pale-blue plastic , the lenses also blue . These , blanketing the upper half of her face , emphasized the chiselled prettiness of her mouth and the angry-seeming spatter of freckles across her nose . " Not so good , " he said , remembering to speak English this time . " Too much blue . " The girl put on a third pair , and this time smiled  --  a fierce quick smile that pounced upon the space between her pointed chin and bone-straight nose  --  for when I solemnly looked to give my third verdict , the dark lenses were mirrors , and what I saw , my brown suit swallowed by the two receding drugstorespacked into the girl 's mocking sockets , was myself , badly shaven , badly dressed , bug-eyed with youth and fright . Her name was Candace . We were to meet often , as fellow freshmen , and became lovers . She was blond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powdery I imagined I could lick it off . " Our parched lips sting / and the rivers of our heart rush upward / to greet the vivid juice of symmetry , " Ellellou sang , climbing the narrow brick stairs that ascended to the second floor from the panelled and bossed ancient doorway , so low even he had to stoop , that stood beside the doorway into the basketry-and-hashish shop like an overdressed child beside its preoccupied mother ; the shop door stood ajar , yielding to the nameless itinerant seller of images of oranges a murky glimpsep105of the shop 's proprietor leaning forward from beneath his overhanging wilderness of drying raffia and completed but unshaped weaves to exchange with a customer shrouded in rags an elongate packet for a sheaf of rustling , dust-colored lu . Beneath the customer 's ragged hem Ellelloft glimpsed , or imaginedhe glimpsed , denim cuffs and the coarse arabesque of platform soles . A tourist , perhaps .

Eradicate tourism : he made the mental note , and tapped the three syllablesof his name , El/lel/loft , on Kutunda 's door , beneath the brass anti-burglary lock she had recently installed . Eradicateproperty , he thought , eradicate theft . Kutunda was dressed , for it was mid-morning , in the trim Dacron skirt and jacket , with secretarial upsweep and sensible dearth of bangles , in which she reported to her office in the Palais d'Administration des Noires . And Ellellou had seen her flitting in and out of Ezana 's office wearing reading glasses like two half-moons cradled on their backs ; when she gazed level across their tops , her brown , nearly black eyes appeared startled , her brain beating time behind them and the inquisitive , interrupted arch of her eyebrows also offending him , for she had taken to plucking only the hairs between them , whereas in the desert , with a flint for a razor , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thin line . When women cease to beautify , Marx warns , an economic threat is posed to men . " I have an appointment , " she told him , as if in truth and not in disguise he was a seller of oranges , with none to sell . " With your President . Now , " Ellelloft told her . " Take off that absurd capitalist costume . "  |p106Her  tone slipped to a more deferential notch as she offered , " I can put myself at your service any time after lunch , my lord . " " Allah reprieves no soul when its term is ended , " he quoted , and slipped from his own costume . A fearful reluctance , for she had been imbued with un-Kushite ideals of punctuality , dragged at her hand as together they undid the buttoned , zippered work of the past hour 's dressing . The uncovering of her brassiere , and the prim clean underpants , excited him ; in the America he had known , a lust had attached to these radiantly laundered undergarments greater than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of aesthetic beauty and the inviolability of marble . Her eyes unaided by spectacles perceived the sign and sceptre of his having been stirred ; the dictator bade her , still in her elastic underwear , to kneel to him . Amusement flavoring her indignation , Kutunda with her generous mouth , whose lips had the width but not the eversion of the blacker maidens of the Grionde , and whose little inturned teeth tingled like stars in the night of his nerves , rhythmically swallowed him ; their silhouettes , as shallow in relief as figures on a Pharaoh 's wall , were almost motionless in the full-length mirror she had installed , between two of the big armoires she had bought to hold her swelling wealth of clothes . In addition to these , silk-lined and papered outside with reproductions of La chasse de la licorne and other Flemish menues verdures , Swiss reproductions so fine one could see every thread of the tapestries , Kutunda had acquired a steel desk supporting what appeared to be a dictating machine , plus tiers of plastic in-out trays , and flanking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that when Ellellouelected to drive home the seed his skillful and by now inspired mistress had brought to the verge of light , it was not easy to find a space of floor in which to execute his decision ;  |p107the  dramatic tug whereby he removed her underpants also brought his elbow into sharp contact with an edge of metal and tears to his eyes . The red thought , Sex is atrocity , flashed into his mind , along with the holy text , Impatience is the very stuff which man is made of . He pushed on ; down among the steel handles and jutting drawers he recovered the earthy closeness , if not the satisfactorily rank aromas , of their first love-bouts , in the gritty ditches of unsuccessful wells . He laughed as her gutteral cries exactly fitted his recollections . " My President , " she said , when her breathing eased , " has found himself again .

She was throwing on clothes and glancing at her wristwatch , pinching it to redden its face with numbers . " What appointment with Ezana and his underlings , " Ellellouasked , " can take such precedence over your adored ? " " You take everything so personally , " the wench accused , retightening her chignon and snatching up her briefcase . " I adore you , but it 's not much of a career , is it , sitting around above a hash shop waiting to turn on the adoration ? Michaelis gives me things to do ; I ca n't really read yet , but I can talk on the telephone , and almost every day now I have these fascinatingconversations with a woman whose Sara is quite fluent but really so funnily accented , I have to control myself from laughing sometimes  --  she phones all the way from Washington nearly every morning , I forget what hour it is their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't have the same time we do , they must be going to bed at dawn and having lunchp108under the stars .

She tells me what the weather is like , and how long the lines are at the gas stations , and what a nice man Mr. Agnew was , always so well-spoken and well-groomed "  --  she glanced about wildly , looking for something she lost , and then found it , the alligator case containing her reading glasses  --  " and then Mr. Klipspringercomes on and talks to Michaelis . " " And what does this lackey of the oppressors say to Colonel Ezana ? " I asked , my fury , which pressed inside my head like corked champagne , defizzed by the melancholy observation that she no longer moved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , twitchily , like a modern woman connected to a variety of energy-sources . Her nobly stout legs , with their calloused , broadened heels and pantherlike thighs , had been slimmed , by some ( I imagined ) calibrated diet whose pseudo-medical niceties were catered to even in the depths of our famine . " Oh , I do n't know , they talk in English , I suppose about the reparations  --  " " Reparations ? " My doxy was frightened , seeing that these matters , which had become commonplace in her bureaucratic life , were a scandal to me ; feigning , this time , a search , she with her briefcaseand Dacron suit and trim legs and taut shiny hair from which all sand and mutton grease had been rinsed , looking everywhere but into my face , backpedalled and dodged about the cluttered , compressed room , before whose door I stood guard , soldierly though naked , a small brown man not reallyp109weary of being deceived .

At the moment , if my understanding is accurate , and it may well not be , in exchange for the ashes and an apology to President Chremeau , whose territory was violated  --  " " Never ! He violated ours by giving the white devils free passage . " " And you know , of course , about the Koran in Braille . " " Braille ? " " A wonderful invention , " Kutunda explained with innocententhusiasm , " that enables the blind to read with their hands .

That 's super . I have n't missed too much of the meeting , it was going to be a slide show and those are always slow to set up . Klipspringer has sent us a whole crate of carousels showing agriculture and irrigation in the Negev . You could come too . You could give me a ride . Do n't you have anything to do up at the Palais ?

It 's neat . " It heartened me to see the desert child in her revived , wheedling and winsome , at the thought of a ride in my Mercedes . " I 'll drop you on the way , " I said . " I still have my morning prayers to do . " The little Mosque of the Clots of Blood was obscurely placed in the east of Al-Abid , from which remote section the Palais showed its unfinished side , the unstuccoed mud bricksno .  |p111crumbling  cariously . Here the land becomes flat and the space between the square earth houses , the tembes , widens and tufts of dry grass where footsteps neglect to tread evoke the savanna that once flourished here , before goats and God killed it . The mosque has no minaret , and protruding support timbers stick from its sides like toothpicks from an olive . All civic prestige was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Disaster ; but within the vacant court a limestone fountain whose worn lip was edged with a raised inscription that could be made out to be the first verse of the ninety-sixth sura , Recite in the name of your Lord , the Creator , who created man from clots of blood , offered through all the hours of the days and nights of our drought fresh water for the ablutionsof the pious . From what source ? Touching my hands to the reverently incised stone , then to the startling running cool crystal of the liquid , then to my lips and eyelids in the prescribed manner , I thought of thirst , of its passion greater than any other save the passion for pain to cease , and of the unknown men , their names and bones now lost as thoroughly as grains of sand underfoot in Istiqlal , who had dug down to this undying spring , where so few chose to come . The interior of the Mosque of the Clots of Blood was empty , always empty but for the senile imam at the five appointed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open to the unpopulated peace of Allah . Turn up your eyes : can you detect a single flaw ? The wall containing the mihrab had been covered with a pale-blue tile , patternless . I knelt ; prostrated myself ; repeated the raka thrice ; then sat back on my heels , my hands at rest on my thighs , and let the meditative backwash of prayer move through me , purifying . In America my friends , late at night , confidential and searching on wine and beer , for hashish then was known only to musicians , would inquire about my religion , proposing thep112possibility  --  to their minds , an empirical certainty  --  that God did not exist , as if this possibility rendered futile the exercises of my piety , which to their minds appeared a wasted enterprise , a bad investment . My faith was not then beyond being troubled , and if in those small inebriated hours I gazed down within myself I saw many shifting transparencies and at the bottom of them no distinct and certain God . Indeed on the rationallevel many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our Koran is the last God to be born , a furious Last Gasp that set the tongue of the Prophet to whirling in terror and whose mystics have whirled ever since , a God Who cuts like a hot knife through the polyheaded pictorial absurditiesof the Hindu and the Catholic , the Methodist and the fetishist , a God without qualities ; so perhaps belief in Him also lacks qualities . Some of our Sufis have divulged that at the height of purity in which Godhead dwells existence and the lack of it are trivial quibbles ; the distinction amid that radiance looms imperceptible . What can be purer than non-existence ? What more soothing and scourging ? Allah 's option is to exist or not ; mine , to worship or not . No fervor overtops that which arises from contact with the Absolute , though the contact be all one way . The wall of pale-blue tiles echoed the repose and equilibrium within me , a silence never heard in lands of doubt and mockery . Blue tile . A single fly , whose motions showed supernatural intelligence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be broken down as geometric . My mind flowed with this fly into emptiness . I saw what I must do . It was a step along transparent stairs . All praise be to Allah , the Magnificent , the Merciful . A single small window , the scallops of its arch half-crumbled into dazzling dust , showed the depth and strength of the blue day besieging in vain the little mosque 's thick walls . My gaze drank these tiles.  |p113Ezana  looked up , surprised to see me , more surprised to see Opuku and Mtesa behind me . It was not our usual hour for consultation . In the hour of dusk , he had put on a sashed robe of paisley silk and was sipping from a tall glass in which a slice of lime floated , while the air conditioner purred at his ear . He was reading a book , an American novel , no doubt concerning the grotesque sexual misadventures of a Jewish intellectual or a self-liberated woman . Its contents were makinghim smile , and the smile was slow to leave his face . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lifted his feet , slippered in Italian leather , from the Moroccan hassockwhere they rested and would have risen in greeting had I not signalled him to stay at ease . " I have come to be briefed , " I said , " upon the negotiations with the Americans that I understandare proceeding . " " Not negotiations , conversations , " he said . " This fellow Klipspringer is rather hard to cut short , he is so  --  what do you Americans say ?  --  giving . " " You Americans ? " " Forgive me , my President , the Americans . You have just walked into this book I am reading , full of these poor benightedbourgeoisie struggling to psychoanalyze the universe . I am tasting this trash the better to understand our enemy . They are a strange lost race , us  --  they too have a deficient balance of trade , a high unemployment rate , an agricultural bias in the national temperament , and the need for a protectionist tariff if their struggling native industries are not to be overwhelmed by the superior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Comrade President , at a time when the Arabs have allp114the capital , the Siberians and the Brazilians all the undeveloped resources , and the Chinese all the ideological zeal , one wonders if in the interests of global stability a grant of aid to the United States might not be a prudent apportionment within our next year 's national budget . I jest , of course . " " Of course . Yet it does sound as though this Klipspringer has all too amiably insinuated confusions into the mind of my chief minister . These people are pirates . Without the use of a single soldier their economy sucks wealth from the world , in the service of a rapacious , wholly trivial and wasteful consumerism . My order was , in answer to their overtures , no answer . " " But no answer is an answer , which goads the interrogator . By discussing , we are delaying , and dissolving . This wretched Gibbs has not been mentioned for days . We can not pretend the Americans do not exist ; they have leverage upon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peanuts we cease to exist in the world . " " Or begin to exist in a better world . " " Also , as my Colonel knows , some reactionary elements evaded our revolution and took refuge in Sahel ; an infusion of American arms might turn these ridiculous dissidents into an invading force , which would find our borders permeable and our population , however loyal to the name of Ellellou , desperatelyweakened by drought . " " Hungry men make good soldiers , " I pointed out . " When it comes to battle , the poor retain a golden weapon : they have little to lose . Their lives are a shabby anteroom in the palace of the afterlife . The Prophet 's vivid Paradise is our atomic bomb ; under its blast the poor toubabs shrivel like insects clinging to soulless existence . Of the life to come they are heedless . As to the French , they are too busy stuffing their money down the throat of the Concorde to look up ; thep115entire wealth of a nation of misers has been swallowed by this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in materialismand its swinish extinction of spirit . Defiance is our safest as well as noblest policy . " " Even your shy friends the Soviets , " Ezana pursued , " are not exempt from American influence , now that the unspoken standoff has been translated into detente . " " What has driven you , Comrade , so low , into this slime of Realpolitik ? I will save you from the demon you have inhaled . If another call from this Klipspringer is honored with courtesy , the cables to the Palais shall be cut on my order . " His face , all hemispheres and highlights , went dull with disappointment . His gold tooth winked out ; his lower teeth showed in a grimace of grief . " But tomorrow we were to discuss the possibility of an addition to the Braille Library , a leprosarium dedicated to the memory of my father . Yours , I know , was a whirlwind , a pinch of fertilizing dust ; my father I knew and loved . He had been a warrior , then , as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Grionde where the banks draw close . Perhaps because of his ventures to the southern side , he contracted leprosy in midlife , turned silver and perished limb by limb . His nose , his fingers . I watched it transpire . My present dignity and the indignation that enrolled me in the Revolution alike stem from a vow he extracted from me with his final breaths . I vowed that I would climb high into the order of things , that other citizens of Noire would never have to endure suffering and humiliation as unmitigated as his . " " Better , perhaps , to have vowed to face your own end with less complaining than , from the sound of it , your progenitor . " Ezana blinked away this insult to his father . He leaned forward from his easy chair , to confide his message urgently ,  |p116to  press its warmth into the sinuous channels of my ear . My comrade in his foppish accoutrements became more naked to me than since the fury and fear of L'Emergence , and that aftermath in which we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ezana said to me , " The world is not what it was . There is no longer any deep necessity to suffer . The only lesson suffering ever gave was how to endure more suffering . What gives men pain , with some lingering exceptions , can now be cured . Smallpox , even in our bedevilled land , is being encircled and exterminated . We know what children need in their bellies , even when we can not put it there . The fading of an afterlife  --  for it has faded , my friend Ellellou , however you churn your heart  --  has made this life more to be cherished . When all is said and done about the persisting violence on our planet , and the pronouncements of SCRME are set against the fulminations of Nouvelles en Noire et Blanche , the fact remains that the violence , relatively , is small , and deliberately kept small by the powers that could make it big . War has been reduced to the status of criminal activity  --  it is no longer the sport of gentlemen . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We feel it everywhere , even in the vacancies of Kush . Hatred on the national scale has become insincere . The self-righteousness has vanished , that justified great slaughter . The units of race and tribe , sect and nation , by which men identified themselves and organized their youth into armies no longer attract blind loyalty ; the Cubans and Belgians , the Peruvians and Indonesians , all mingle at our Palais receptions , lusting after one another 's wives and complaining alike about the tedium of the diplomatic service in this Allah-forsaken penalty post of a backwater . Such interplay betokens an increase of humane pragmatism and a decrease of demented energy that makes my vow to redeem my father 's life inevitable of success . "  | " These units you disparage , " I said , " were mankind 's buildingblocks . If they dissolve , we have a heap of dust , of individualatoms . This is not peace , but entropy . Like all comfortable cowards , Comrade Ezana , you overvalue peace . Is it possible , " I asked , " that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first contentious thrust of bare existence against the sublime , original void ? The serene heavens , as witnessed by astronomers , shine by grace of explosion and consumption on a scale unthinkable , and the glazed surface of marble or the demure velvet of a maiden 's eyelid are by the dissections of particle physics a frenzy of whirling and a titanic tension of incompatible charges . You and I , for additionalexample , have long been at odds , and the government of Kush has been born of the dialectical space between us . Out of the useful war between us , a synthesis has emerged ; a synthesis , for a while at least , does package the conflicting energies that met within it . " Ezana 's fingers , forced apart by the thick rings upon them , spread wider , in careful thought , upon the glass of his desktop . " I sometimes wonder , my President , if even the fruitful diagrams of Marx do schematic justice to the topology of a world where the Soviet proletariat conducts a black market in blue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bombs and jovial posters of Mao . " " Or where , " I added , " the chief minister of a radical junta holds subversive conversations with the American secret intelligence and attempts to infect his own President with the false , sentimental , atheistical pluralism acquired thereby . " Ezana 's rejoinder was aborted , for Kutunda , her secretarial suit concealed , as per government regulations , in a flowing boubou , burst into Ezana 's office accompanied by an ovalfacedyoung man whom I recognized , through the veil of his formal blandness , as the young Fula policeman who had readp118the Koran to the king . He still wore his plum-colored fez , but the white vest and pantaloons of the high-servant caste had been exchanged for a tapered shirt of needle-fine stripes and taupe slacks of indecently close tailoring about his hips yet so wide at the cuff only the square enamelled-looking tips of his shoes were unenveloped . Both Kutunda and he were holding full glasses and returning to a species of party . She also held a box of those salty biscuits called HiHo , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They had returned , however , to witness their host 's being taken into custody by Mtesa and Opuku , at my command , as a traitor to the state , and as a wearer of silk . Ezana was confined to the king 's old rooms in the barracks wing of the Palais d'Administrationdes Noires , above the floor occupied by the People 's Museum of Imperialist Atrocities and within earshot of the shrieks of the Istiglal Anti-Christian High School for Girls volleyball team . His protests , his pleas , would fatigue me to scribble . One of them was , " My President , if you incarcerate your Chief Minister , and simultaneously proceed with your individualistic , entrepreneurial pilgrimage to the rumored cave in the Balak Massif , you will leave Kush without a head of state ! " I doubted that Kush would notice , but to be on the safe side , and to demonstrate to Ezana my liberated , inspired powers of decision , I turned to the young fez-wearing spy and appointed him Acting Minister of the Interior , Chief of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Chairmanof the Board of Tourism . Kutunda , I said , would instruct him in his duties . Duties , duties . Before I could depart it was necessary that I visit my second wife , that I press my little thornbush to myp119bosom . She lived , the Muffled One , in a shuttered villa in the most venerable part of Les Jardins , where the plane and chestnut trees imported by the colons had grown tall in the fifty wet years prior to 1968 , only to falter , droop , and die in the five years since . Their blanched skeletons , brutally cropped in the Gallic manner , lined the curving avenues . Candace 's villa had been rankly overgrown , but the drought had done some work of pruning where the hand of man had been idle ; a sapless , leafless Petrea volubilis made its desiccated way along cracks in the stucco facade , clutching the shutters with splintering fingers and spiralling up the little Ionic pillars of the front portico . The vine had been prying loose the tiles from the portico roof @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chimes produced a strange rustling noise within , but Candace was at the door quickly , as if she had been watching my approach through the blind walls . Or perhaps she had been about to go out , for she was muffled head to toe in a dull black buibui with the addition of a faceveilthat covered even her brow . A scattering of holes smaller than the holes in a cabbage-grater permitted her to see , in speckled fashion . Perhaps some retrograde corner of Afghanistanor Yemen still holds a crazed old spice merchant , sheik , or bandit who keeps his concubines thus ; but in Istiqlal , where socialist progressivism had reinforced the traditional insoucianceof African womanhood , such a costume had to be taken as an irony , a sour joke upon me . " Holy Christ , look who it is n't , " her voice exclaimed through the layers of muslin . Behind her stood a big Songhai maid with a basket on her arm . This girl 's face showed alarm at my visit ; to her I was the ghost of authority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ servant , and not because of any penuriousness of mine . In the early years of our marriage , when I had livedp120with her half , then a third , of my time , the household was appropriately staffed . As my visits dwindled , she bade the attendants drop away , racing through the housework once a month , even poking in the vegetable patch , until the sun nearly smothered her . Now she and her girl were going out shopping ; but since Candy almost never purchased anything , preferring to order all non-perishable goods from the United States by mail-order , I could only conclude that the purpose of these expeditions was to display herself , muffled , as a mystery and , among rumormongers , a national scandal . People said that Ellellou had mutilated this wife in a passion , or to satisfy a perverse sexual need had married a monster of deformity . " You have your fucking nerve , " she continued , " showing up here in your little soldier outfit as if I owe you anything but a  --  a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given pause to the phrase that her native freedom of speech and , now , her feminist consciousness of genital oppression had suggested . But Candace was not a ball-kicker , she was a heart-stabber . " My adored , " I said , " I have come to bid thee good-bye . I am about to walk the edge of my fate , and may fall off . " My Islamic courtesies of course infuriated her . " Do n't give me any of this Kismet crap , " she said . " I knew you when you could n't tell the Koran from the Sears Roebuck catalogue . " As if in recoil from this stab , she angrily turned , my pillar of cloth , and it was alarming , how closely her back resembled her front . In full purdah she seemed less a person than a growth , a kind of gray asparagus . Candace waved the frightened Songhai away , with that jerky embarrassed roughnessof those who think their servants should be their friends , and let herself drop wearily into an imitation Chippendale armchair ordered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this French villa spun of sub-Saharan materials , the rectilinear waterproof comfort of a Wisconsin living-room . But the tile floor , the banco walls , the rattan furniture betrayed the illusion , which termites and the breakage occasioned by our terrible dryness had further undermined . Without removingany of her wrappings , Candace put her sandalled feet up on a curly-maple butler 's tray table whose leaves had warped and loosened in the weather . Where her parents might have had a pair of painted-porcelain mallards with their hollow backs bedding narcissus bulbs rooted in pebbles , she had set an earthen dish holding some unshelled peanuts . I took one , cracked it , and ate it . There is a sweetness , a docile pithy soul-quality of taste , to our Kushian goobers that I have never met elsewhere . " Well , chief , " my wife said , " how 's top-level tricks ? Chopping old Edumu 's noggin off did n't seem to raise the humidity any . " " These spiritual balances are not easy to strike . I have put Michaelis Ezana @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the difference . He has been compromising the honor of our country with your ex-compatriots . " " Poor guy , probably just trying to bring a little rationale into Ellellou 's heaven on earth . " " Tell me , " I countered , " the rationale of the Universe , and I will order my heaven accordingly . " " Do n't go undergraduate on me , " Candace said . " That 's how you got me into this hellhole , being all winsome and philosophical , building the no-nations up from scratch . Scratch is the word . Scratch is where you start , and scratch is where you end . God , it 's hot in this damn bag . " " Take off the veil , " I suggested . " Your joke is wasted on your forbearing husband . " " Joke , my ass , " she said , and my own nervousness eased at the hardening of her voice , certain as daybreak to go harderp122and higher . " Who was it who smuggled me in in wraps in the first place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a zawiya Berber too pious to be seen ? And then after those rotten PanAfricangames leaked it around that Sittina was his second wife instead of his third ? Who was it , Mr. Double-1 double-1 oo , who put me deeper into wraps when came the Revolution and every Yank in Istiglal was shipped back to Ellis Island ? Christ , if you do n't think I would n't have been over-goddam-joyed to go back with the rest of them where you can have a drink of water without lifting out the centipedes first and bowing toward smelly Mecca five times a day and having to kick starving kids out of your way every time you walk the goat , you have another think coming . But oh no , not me , crazy old Candy , all A 's in Poll Sci but loyal as a mutt out of class , crazy , conditioned to be some man 's slave , sitting here watching my fucking life melt away , and you call it a joke . You would , " Candace said , and undid her head wraps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ veil . Her face . Much as I had first seen it , without the mirroring sunglasses , the receding aisles of evil goods , her cheeks still round and firm , her chin pointed , her nose bone-white , bonestraight . She even smiled , her fierce quick smile , in relief at her head 's being free . " Christ , I can breathe , " she said . Flaxen wisps looped in damp deshabille onto her flushed brow ; from the corners of her blue eyes , the milky blue-green of beryl , fanned vexed wrinkles that could have been produced , in another life , by laughter . Her powder-pale skin was still young ; it had not suffered in my country as it would have in her own , had not been baked and whipped by the sun of golf courses and poolside patios and glaring shopping center parking lots in these years when , as the Wrapped One , she had sheltered herself amid the mysteries of Istiqlal . I was glad of this . Watch/ing her unwind her headshawl , and then unveil , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ memory of her body movingpale , loose , and lithe in the neon-tinged darkness of an off-campus room numbed me so that had all the world 's sorrow been at this moment funnelled into my poor narrow being I would not have felt an iota more : I was full . With the air she could now breathe she had launched a bitchy monologue . " How is dear Sittina ? Still chasing cock and playing Bach ? And my big momma Kadongolimi ? You still mosey round to your old awa for your fix of tribal juice ? And that other idiot , little Sheba  --  has she learned to chew with her mouth shut yet ? But you like that , do n't you ? You like these dyed-in-the-wool down-home Kushy types , do n't you ? Hakim Happy Ellelloft , de mon ob de peeple . De mon what om , right ? Well here 's one cunt that hates your guts , buster . You better stick a stamp on me and send me home . " " You belong here . " " Divorce me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say Tallagtuki ' three times . Come on , say it . One , two  --  Divorce me and you 'll have a slot for this new twat , what 's her name . " " Kutunda . Our connection is entirely official . As to you , my beloved Candace , my personal attachment aside , you serve a purpose for the nation . There is pressure on our borders . When the Day of Disaster comes , I can point to you as proof that the President of Kush is anti-imperialist but by no means anti-American . " " You do n't know what you are , you poor little spook . You are the most narcissistic , chauvinistic , megalomaniacal , catatonicschizoid creep this creepy continent ever conjured up . And that 's saying a lot . " Her clinical epithets reminded me of her book-club books  --  the warping , fading , termite-riddled stacks and rows of volumesimported from her native land , popular psychology andp124sociology mostly . How to succeed , how to be saved , how to survive the mid-life crisis , how to find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to love , how to face death , how to harness your fantasies , how to make dollars in your spare time  --  the endless self-help and self-exploration of a performance-orientedrace that has never settled within itself the fundamentalquestion of what a man is . A man is a clot of blood . Hopeful books , they disintegrated rapidly in this climate ; she had run out of shelf space and stacked this literary foreign aid on the floor , where our great sub-continent of insects hollowed out the covers from underneath , their invisible chewing a rerunof the chewing of her eyes as she read away the monotonoussuccession of her days , weeks , and years . Candace was on her feet and speechifying . " I hate you . I hate this place . I hate the heat , the bugs , the mud . Nothing lasts here , and nothing changes . The clothes when you wash them dry like cardboard . A dead rat on the floor is a skeleton by noon . I 'm thirsty all the time , are n't you ? Happy "  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm sinking , and I ca n't do anything about it . I 'm seeing the only shrink in Istiqlal and he shrugs and says , Why do n't you just leave ? ' I tell him , I ca n't , I 'm married to the President ! ' " Her straw-blond , straw-bright hair fell forward as if to veil her sobbing ; my impulse to reach and offer comfort was checked only by my certain knowledge that this offer would fail , that my loving touch would feed her anger as the books on how to be happy fed her unhappiness . She lifted her head , her eyes red-rimmed but abruptly dry . In the simple bold style with which she had once asked me , " How do I look ? " , she asked , " Ca n't you get me out of this ? " " This , as perhaps your friend the Freudian marabout has already suggested , is you . You have chosen . I am powerless to alter your choices . When we were in your land , not mine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poverty , my strangeness , my blackness , was slow to respond . I was afraid of the consequences . You were heedless . Your heart demanded . So be it . Here you are . Had you allowed me , fifteen years ago , to give you the children I then wanted , your son would be taller than you now , and your daughters would be cheerful company . " " Shit on that , " Candace mumbled . " I was n't sure . You were n't either . We did n't want to take on that responsibility , everything was difficult enough , we knew what we were doing might not work . " " You did n't wish , " Ellellou told her , " to become the mother of Africans . " " It 's not that simple , and you know it . You were different once we got here , you did n't make me feel secure . Big Momma had you half the time , and then you got so thick with the king . Anyway , I did n't always use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of us is sterile . Your other wives , are those children yours ? We should have discussed things like this years ago . Where were you ? " " Tending to duty . " The primness of Ellellou 's answer indicated that the conversation had exhausted its usefulness for him . He had suffered enough recrimination to fuel his departure . Sensing him about to slip away , Candace clung and asked , " If I tried to go home , would you stop me ? " " As your husband , I would indulge you in all things . As father , however , of all the citizens of Kush , I would feel obligedto discourage defection . In this time of crisis and dearth , our human resources must be conserved . Border patrols have been instituted to confine the nomads . Every peanut caravan as it departs includes a quota of spies and enforcers . I wish the imperialist press , which describes our socialist order as ap126squalid police state , to receive no malicious hint confirming rumors of maladministration within Kush . Your presence , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Let me add that Opuku 's brother , whom you have not met , nor would I wish it , has in his patriotic love of order developed a number of interesting ways to inflict discomfort without leaving any mark upon the body . I confide this to you in a spirit of tendernessand affection . " The white woman 's eyes blazed ; the rims of her lips wrinkledwith tension . " You sadistic little turd . When I think of what I wanted to give you . You know what everybody at college used to say to me ? They said I was crazy to put myself at the mercy of a Negro . " " You needed to prove them right , " Ellellou said , bothered by a certain poignant twist in her body , as in some lateHellenicrobed statues , implying the erotic axis of the body within , and within that an ambivalent torque of the soul  --  in Candace 's case , between taunting and plea , a regret that even in her extremity of rage she should taunt her husband with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the two of them together undergraduate stars at McCarthyCollege , in that distant city of Franchise . " I should n't tell you this , but you know what Professor Craven used to say to me ? I wo n't say it . " " Say it , if it will help you . " " He said , Today 's slave , tomorrow 's tyrant . " " Excellent . By the same token , Today 's liberal , tomorrow 's bigot . You could have had Professor Craven , you could have been for a time his reigning student concubine , but you chose to slight him . " " He was married . " " So was I. " " I could n't believe it . When I met Kadongolimi here , whenp127I saw she really existed , I nearly died . How could you do that to me ?  --  have such a big fat wife . I thought you were making her up . We were in America . You were so touching , such a ragamuffin . " Ellellou slapped her , so little did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut in those days . Lest she think the blow had been unconsidered , he repeated it ; the pink stain on her cheek glowed wider than his hand as it deepened to red . She would have twisted quite away had he not held her shoulders . Her pose reminded him now of those thin-lipped , supernaturallycool Flemish Virgins impassive , with averted eyes , beside a pointed arch giving upon a tiny crowded turquoise landscape . The rift of sorrow in him widened . Terrible , he thought , that rebuke had come upon her not for any of her insults but for a moment of innocent openness , remembering a ragamuffin . " Believe this then , " Ellellou told her harshly , in apology . " For your safety : you are my wife . For your comfort : this will pass . I will not always be President . " Colonel Ellellou finally departed from Istiglal in the last month , Dhu ' 1-Hijja , of that troubled year . The afternoon temperature in the square of the Mosque of the Day of Disaster was 112 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , along with the faithful Opuku and Mtesa , his fourth wife , Sheba.  |p128Beneath  the stars the roofy desert spreads Vacant as Libya. - HERMAN MELVILLE , 1863HE REGION CALLED THE BALAK iS the size of France , ifAlsace-Lorraine had been permanently conceded to Germanyand by the same treaty Belgium had been annexed . Arab traders as early as the year 400 A.H . noted a peculiarity of these barren heights which European adventurers of the nineteenth century A.D. , such as Heinrich Barth and Gustav Nachtigal , confirmed : a local absence of color . The sky here is white , and the earth , in contrast to the vivid ochres , reds , and mauves of the northwest quadrant of Kush , shows in its rocks and dunes , its playas and wadis , its reg , erg , and hammada , only dreary varieties of gray . The valleys of molten glass have already been mentioned ; the low xerophytic growth has , by the process of natural selection , subdued its natural green to a tint fainter than that of the palm leaves in a faded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the world 's dullest flowers ; here white scorpions and black snakes live off one another 's eggs . Travellers have provoked skepticism by reporting how evenp129the gaudiest goods and garb are gradually drained to mono chrome in the slow climb through the Massif ; dear Sheba laden with gold and coral , copper and jasper , lapis lazu and chrysoprase , her eyelids daubed with antimony and he fingernails with henna , her exquisite chocolat-sans-lait hod ' wrapped in silver-embroidered indigo , scarlet , and turquoise even her feet clad in sandals whose parrot green chimed wit the parrot-belly pink of her toenails , day by day was overlain with deeper and deeper layers of the dust of colorlessnes ! Her skin , glossy as coal , shed its purple highlights ; the palm of her hands no longer lifted to release glimpses of lilac ; eve her tongue seemed no longer red , lolling in the velvet orific her careless jaw revealed as she incessantly chewed kola nut ; Her teeth and the whites of her eyes in this atmosphere gleame more brilliant than ever , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by an ink-laden fine quill . Th stem of her neck , the virtuoso arabesques of her sullen profilf and the perfect , burnished crimpings of her ears all looke limned and shaded by an artist whose effects the addition c color would have muddied . Sheba was petite , the only one c my wives smaller than I , and her beauty was sharpened to blueprint precision , the immaculate mechanics of a butterfl husk , with this removal of the rainbow . Four hundred kilometers from Al-Abid the piste dwindle to an impassable trail between ashen rocks . We left the grayer than-ever Mercedes to Opuku and Mtesa and joined , in th guise of a detribalized anzad player and her protector , a can van carrying ( we gathered ) from Quagadougou or Niamey t a contraband depot on the Zanj border a medley of siniste goods . The caravan leader was a hirsute , jittery brute of tl Kel-ulli tribe ; Sidi Mukhtar was his name and his person abur dantly mixed what the intrepid Barth called the three trad tional Arab qualities of rejela ( valor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . Sheba  --  who was kittenish at first  --  and I peeked whenever we could into the camel-bags , where we found such contraband as hallucinogenic khat , firearms of Czech and Mexican manufacture , plastic sandals from Japan , transistor radios assembled on such low-wage platforms as Singapore and Hong Kong , and boxes and boxes of Bic pens , Venus pencils , and Eberhard Faber typewriter erasers . There were also wooden crates of what Sheba thought would be bullets and grenades but when we pried a slat loose proved to be black ribbons on metal spools , white correction cartridges , and steely , spherical , UFOish IBM type elements for not only the Arabic alphabet but for the 276 characters of Amharic and the antique squiggles of Geez . Had Sidi Mukhtar known of our prowlings he would have staked us to an anthill and left us to shrivel like banana skins cast aside . Or so he said . Actually , the caravan was a loose , good-natured federation of like-minded individual mercantile entrepreneurs , in the best traditions of African humanism ; the sole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was done with an iron hand . Our days began at night . We were awakened beneath the stars  --  the stars ! in the midnight absolute that arched above the Balak the constellations hung inflamed like chandeliers  --  and made our way , tinkling and sighing and snorting , toward the pearl dawn whose blush was as delicate as the pink tinge in nacre , to that point in mid-morning when the camels began to squat down simply of despair . The camel is an engaging creature spiritually : he proceeds steadily to the breaking-point beyond which he can not go at all , and then , like as not , he is apt to squat down , blink , take one more breath through his rubbery nostrils , and die . We were supposed to sleep in our tents through the torrid mid-day , but in fact it was difficult , with the whistle of the wind in the peg-ropes , and a sense of restless activity outside ( presences of sand that yet mutteredp131and cast man-shaped shadows on the translucent tent-sides ) , and our thirsty anticipation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skins , the zemzimayas , were brought around by an evil-smelling henchman of Sidi Mukhtar 's ; he determined our quotas by counting the bobs of our Adam 's apples , and never failed to jostle Sheba 's succulent breasts in tearing the leather canteen from her hands . To pass the dazed , insomniac afternoons Sheba and I would attempt to make love , but grains of sand interposed and abraded our venereal membranes . The sand here was strange , black and white like salt and pepper , and at moments seemed an immense page of print too tiny to read . She would lie with her head on my belly , gently blowing me , or else play the anzad and sing , while I softly beat time on the hollows of my abdomen : " Do it to me , baby , do it if you can . If l ca n't have a drink of water , I 'd as soon suck off a man . " The sun beat upon the squares of camel hide above us so hard as to render them thin as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we sought the shadow of each other 's bodies . There would enter my mind these streams and shady gardens old , harried Mohamet conjured up in the after-hours babble of his mid-life crisis to lead the mulish Meccans away from their stony idols and female deities , and , more persistently still , of the soda fountain of the Franchise drugstore , named if I rememberedcorrectly Oasis Pharmaceuticals and Sundries , where I had first met Candace , amid that frightful hectoring of brightly packaged newnesses , beside the baleful tree of sunglasses . And while Sheba 's dear head , the lustrous hair of which she braided no two days with the same intricacy , restedp132stickily on my stomach and her ash-colored , thirst-swollen tongue loyally teased my absent-minded penis , my thoughts would swim through rivers of lemonade rickeys , lime phosphatesthat dripped their fizzing overflow into the chrome grate below the taps , Coca-Cola brewed out of syrup upon chips of ice , 7-Ups paler than water itself , and that mysterious dark challenger to the imperial Coke , the swarthy , enigmatic Pepsi , with whom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those days of plenty so lavishly prepared that the counter-boy , ingloriously dubbed the " soda jerk , " served them in two containers , one of cloudy , hefty glass and the other of the chill futuristic metal in which the sudsy marvel had been churned . These " soda jerks , " I came to understand , were recruitedfrom the adolescent ranks of the " townies "  --  that is , the permanent residents of Franchise , refugees from subsistencefarming in the main , every last one of them white and Gentile , as opposed to those of us smuggled in academic gowns into the community as students at McCarthy College , whose brick pinnacles and massy treetops hovered above the gravelly flat roofs of the " towny " business section like the upper levels of a ziggurat , where only gods and priests feeding dead kings dare venture . Emerging , blinking , from Oasis Pharmaceuticals , my mind 's eye confronted , between me and that ivy-shaggy campus corner opposite , the breadth of Commerce Street , with its dangling traffic light and surging traffic of opulent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Fifties , seemed to this interloper fat , abundant , and bubblelike , from the fenders of the cars to the cranium of the President . Franchise was a middle-sized city of 35,000 . Its main street ran straight as an arrow , disused trolley tracks still embedded in its center . Its few factories , mostly devoted to paper manufacture , were out of sight down by the lake , whose breezes they tainted with the chemical overflow of the pulpingp133process . The lake had been left , with that romantic douceur the Americans trail in the wake of their rapacities , its Indian name , Timmebago , though the bestowers of that name had been long since scourged from its shores by gunfire , firewater , and smallpox . In the summer , the brightness of which lasted into October , the merchants of Franchise lowered awnings above their storefronts , and the virtually continuous strip of scalloped shadow laid along the dazzling wide sidewalk now merged with the stifling shade of the tent as I lay there flooded in my thirst by remembrance ; my mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twice , crossed the dangerous street and hustled into the deep green closures of the college . Beneath the stately arches of the elms and the more horizontal branches of the oaks and copper beeches the spaces appeared subaqueous and we students , elongated as by refraction , silent swimmers . In this aquarium light the academic buildings seemed plaster templeslowered into our element as ornaments , with solid insides and painted-on windows ; the pillared Classics building looked especially fake . Then the wheel of North American weather turned and there came an elemental change : the roof of elmleaveswas golden , and falling , and letting in sky , and the leaves were burning in great piles tended by the college grounds crew , grizzled old townies who ogled our girls ; the autumnal fragrance of leaf-smoke overpowered the caustic emissions of the paper mills and recalled to young Felix the patches of brush that were cleared for cassava and maize by the women of his village . They would sing , chopping , uprooting , bending from the waist in unison beneath that African sky whose vastness was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farm-country sky the straight main street dissolvedinto , past the hedges , the lawns , the Victorian-Gothic faculty housing . Above silver silos and corn rows and rollingp134meadows studded with fat cows , the platinum clouds piled one on top of another in a triumphant , vaporous wealth . In Africa , the clouds ran like herds of wildebeest , strung-out and gray , hastening , always , to get somewhere else , in this savanna that had to be vast , for in any one place it was poor . Then , the carousel of seasons turning again , fire became air , the leaves blew all away ; all was black and white , black twigs on white sky , black men on white earth , and Candy was waiting , waiting for her happy , at the dark cave mouth of Livingstone Hall , her snow-bright bangs set off by a knitted scarf the red of Christmas ribbon . Her mother had knitted this scarf , and the matching red mittens with which Candy was hugging her mold-colored notebooks and big Ec text with its slick cover of smiling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Snow was all about like a mirage , a liftingness in the bottom of Happy 's vision that made the automobiles sing in chains and lowered windowsills to the level of the ground . This was truly another world , that had bred another race of men to make their way , barking joyously , through this illusory element , this starry mud . One handful of those tiny ice-feathers would bite into his face now , would dissolve his . lips and open his throat again , so he could croak a word of love to Sheba . Kissed , Candy would hurry him into the cave , where the radiators were hurlingheat recklessly against the cold that entered with them through the double doors , the linoleum floors dirty with melted footprints and tracked-in fragments  --  matches , gum wrappers , the little red strip that pulled open a cigarette pack  --  of the culture of paper and radiant waste around them . I must have dozed . When I awoke , Sheba 's head was heavy on my sandy belly or my Ec textbook was open in my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chart of the decline in the purchasing power of the guilder since 1450 . A few more minutes , the lecture would end , and I could have my noon beer in the Badger Cafe . There were luncheonettes , ice-creamp135parlors , and bars in the city blocks around the campus ; in these we would gather , these islands of warmth in the ocean of cold , and talk , Candy and I and her friends . A number of her friends were American Negroes , then beginning to be called Afro-Americans ; she was one of those white women who can not leave black men alone . No mark of Cain or Ham identifies such a female , but some questing chromosome within holds her sexually fast to the tarbaby . Candy 's parents in her childhood had had colored cooks and maids , and at the side of these corpulent , didactic , floury-handed mammies the child had felt a cherishing and security absent from the hysterically neat rooms of the house beyond the kitchen . This had been in Chicago ; at about the time of what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father moved his insurance agency to Oshkosh . Chicago 's black circumambience thinned to an off-center pocket of paperworkers , ex-slaves whose escape had stopped short of Canada . And in all-white Franchiseany dark faces must belong to McCarthy students : flip , coffee-colored Barry Little from Kalamazoo ; Muslimized , bitter-black Oscar X from Chicago 's South Side ; quiet , **25;5033;TOOLONG Schwarz up the river from East St. Louis . Med Jhabvala , with his pointed beard and fluting , female voice , and myopic , beautiful Wendy Miyamoto , from San Francisco , who got 99s on all her exams and rarely said a word , completed our shadowy circle . There was even an Indian on campus , a Dakota called Charlie Crippled Steer , who stalked along in fur-lined earflaps and threw things at track meets ; he sat at our table once in a while , but did not like us . He did not like anybody , striding the snowy diagonals of our walks with a frozen grimace , his mouth a sad slash , his eyes small as currants . These marginal Americans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tent flaps in the mindless wind , the overheard snuffling of stoic camels and the clangorous harangues of desperately bored camel-drivers , myp136flickering memories of that exotic Wisconsin seemed bits of a Fifties movie , with its studiously recruited cross-section meant to emblemize the melting pot , the fertile and level moral prairie of American goodness . This prairie 's harvest celebration came at McCarthy each November , in the Thanksgiving football game against our arch-rival , Pusey Baptist , an even more northerly academic village of virgins and bruisers that , for the four years of my undergraduate career , was four times narrowlydefeated  --  in 1954 by an intercepted pass , in 1955 by a goal-line stand , in 1956 by a heroic , dodging , arhythmical , incredible end run by a sandy-haired instant legend who next year died uncomplainingly of leukemia , and in 1957 , most thrillingly for us non-gringos , by a field goal kicked sideways , soccer style , from the forty-three-yard line by a Peruvian general 's degenerate son , who had gone out for the team as a way of making homosexual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has hollowed out ! The pom-poms ! The beer kegs ! The single-throated roaring in the concrete bowl , named Kellogg Stadium for its benefactorcorporation and irreverently nicknamed the Breakfast Dish . And seen from high above through the vapor of tens of thousands of breaths , those synchronized American cheerleaders , a row of M 's ( " Give me an M , " they would implore ) , yelling in the zero weather for victory as nakedly as Zulus ( " Give me a C ! " ) , their cheeks flaming ( " Give me a C , A , RI " ) , their breasts pouncing as in rapid succession each dropped to one knee and shot forth an arm . Rah ! I licked my lips , remembering the beer in the frats afterward , where the Pusey Baptists were invited to drown their annual sorrow , and the rugs stank like swamps of hops , and the exceptional co-ed , liberated without a restraining philosophy of liberation , liquidly consigned herself , in a ratty upstairs chamber , with hip-hoisted skirt and discarded underpants , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her head ,  |p137and  our skins where melted together threatened to tear . She lay her head beside my arm , her jaw ajar , and with a gray tongue licked the sweat from my pores . Was I happy ? They called me so , but in truth the studies were hard . I had been granted a scholarship from some nefariousreserve of laundered and retitled government money , and had to keep up my grades , and in addition worked as waiter and short-order cook in various eating establishments within a walk of the McCarthy campus , including a Howard Johnson 's , with its dummy minaret , on the thru-traffic edge of Franchise . I did not work in any of the places where my circle of friends gathered . I did not want them embarrassed by having me serve them . I did not want them to hear the towny waitresses and kitchen goons call me , not entirely without affection , Grease , Sambo , or Flapjack . Where was I ? The Off-Campus Luncheonette was foggy with cigarette smoke and thermal-interface steam , with the plinging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pure Dairy Products Ice Cream Parlor had twirled-wire chairs and round marbletop tables whose **43;5087;TOOLONG camouflaged the slopped excess of our gooey sundaes and viscid , frothy sodas ; the Badger Cafe offeredsawdust on the floor and high-backed booths of darkstainedplywood . Here we would badger Oscar X about his remarkable faith . " You mean to say , " Turnip Schwarz would insist in that Southern accent of gently prolonged incredulity , " that this Mr. Yacub really persuaded exactly fifty-nine thousandnine hundred and ninety-nine black people to this Isle of Patmos in order to breed some obnoxious race of white devils that none of these participants would ever live to see and that none of them would want to be anyway ? " Oscar X usually wore brown suits and a white shirt with tie , and spoke in a diction of acquired precision , neatly baring his teeth at the close of each rebuttal . " It did not happen all atp138once . It took , according to the Prophet Mr. Farrad Muhammad , two hundred years of regulated eugenics to create a brown race from the black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ race , two hundred more to produce a race of yellow folk "  --  a crisp little nod here to Wendy , silent on her side of the booth  --  " and from this a final deuce of centuries to the ultimate generation and supreme insult to Allah , the blond , blue-eyed , hairy-assed devils , who went nude on all fours and lived in trees , as all the textbooks tell us . " " Friend , " Barry Little told Oscar X , " that is the pathetic sort of horseshit with which the common nigger has been scrambling his brains in this land all along . You ca n't breed a race in a couple generations , you need a million years ; and what the textbooks tell us for that matter is that the black man is n't the oldest thing , he is the newest thing in Homo sapiens , the latest improved model .

" You 're both talking about alienation , man 's alienation from his species being , and you ca n't talk about that without talking about the self-estrangement induced by forced labor . These racial categories are archaic , they have nothing to do with the class struggle ; the black bourgeoisie , where it exists , is as oppressive , and in the last analysis as inevitably self-destructive , as the white , and now we have to add the yellow . Look at Liberia . "  |p139Wendy  unexpectedly spoke . " Yet did n't Lenin point out that Western capitalism has forestalled its doom by the exploitation , through colonial imperialism , of the natural resourcesand cheap labor of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ devil , " Oscar X broke back in . " He is a deliberately manufactured synthetic devil who is so disgustingthe black man had to herd him across the Arabian desert and put him in those cold dark European Ice Age caves so he would n't destroy the world with his devilish mischief , and that is the proven historical truth , because that is where the white man came from ; he was filling those caves full of gnawed-over bones while the black man down south was puttingup those Pyramids easy as pie . These are facts . " The door of the cafe opened , admitting cold air and Candy . " Here comes pinktoes , " Barry Little muttered . She fetched her own chair and sat at a corner of the already crowded table . The faint flurry of greetings died to a silence until Hakim Felix al-Bini cleared his throat and continued the conversation . " It seems to me , " he said , " the truth of a mythology should not be judged evidentially piece by piece but by its gestalt result . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Frankenstein , seems more than we need , from the standpointof plausibility ; but then so do Hitler , and Joan of Arc , and Jesus . They existed . Many things exist , and our dreams tell us many more exist , or exist elsewhere . What matters in a myth , a belief , is , Does it fit the facts , as it were , backwards ? Does it enable us to live , to keep going ? Yacub seems implausible but it does seem true , as we look around , that the white man is , as Oscar says , a devil . " Candy blushed , right to the neck of her sweater . " I should resent this , " she said , " except you 're all so nice . " " We are not nice , " Barry Little said . " We are rapist apes.

" He was annoyed at her , for she had distracted him , with her complicatedhuman situation of a white woman compelled to mingle with blacks , from some urgent general truth his mind had almostframed . Barry Little had turned to Oscar X again . " The U.S. Negro has peddled horseshit to 01 ' Massah so long he ca n't stop peddling it to himself . Until he gets up off his shiny ass and starts playing the game he can keep squatting right at the bottom of the heap . The game is , grab . That 's why we 've come to school , to learn to grab .

" " You are one thousand per cent off your greedy heads , " replied Oscar X. " Without the Brotherhood of Islam or some such , the single black man in any Northern city is less than nobody . He is not there , he is a hole . When a brother of ours in Temple Two is pulled in by the devil police , we go show up at the station in our nice quiet suits and that brother gets legal attention . He is not bopped . Those devils tuck their clubs away and put on smiles , because they see power .

Slaves lift their heads a fraction of an inch higher . Is this enough result ? It is . Nothingless will produce any result at all . The dictatorship of the proletariat , the divinity of this or that itinerant  --  the crucial question is n't Can you prove it ? but Does it give us a handle on the reality that otherwise would overwhelm us ?

Of course he had in his mind not the parochial concerns of these Americans  --  even the poorest of them rich by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of distant Kush . Candy placed her pale hand upon his and patted it , in consolation for an impossible future , or to recall him to this moment , these foreign accents , these abundant beverages , this cozy bar , this " bull session . " Shots rang out beyond the tent , barking and then whining , spanking the sand in spurts . The rifles of the caravan guards , old M-16s bought at discount , were not slow to answer , through a thatch of grunts and scuffling . Men raced by . Shadowsflickered on the tent sides . The silent comedy of men fighting for their lives . Ellellou pressed Sheba beneath him , rolling her off the mat into a sandy corner where an assassin would not be likely to aim . His brain moved in the lazy logicalp142notches that crisis activated in him , the synapses huge as lightning . He saw with microscopic clarity the glistening impasto of sweat and sand on Sheba 's neck , noted that a necklace of fine lapis lazuli beads had been broken by the violence of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been detected , decided they were 50  --  50 ( Mtesa , who had told Ezana of the mysterious truck , was the negative binary pole ) , and , given a prevalent co-efficient of danger , decided to stay in the tent , in his opaque , bullet-permeable prism of anonymity , rather than make a break into the wind , the dust , the shouts , the colorlessness . He amused himself , in the space betweenvolleys of bullets , with searching amid the sand granulesfor the tiny lapis lazuli beads Sheba had shed , which would have been easier to find had their sparkling blue not ebbed from them . He sifted in his inner ear the friendly gunshotsfrom those of the raiders , and heard the latter describing an arc that was coming no closer , that indeed was receding , into the desert reaches of the level truth that nothing matters in our human scale , for Allah truly is great . Takbir ! This phrase had dawned in its grandeur for Ellellou not in his animist village but far from home , where the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , smoky , bibulous flush of youthful egoism and sexual undercurrentforged the personal armament that would hold off the white man 's encircling , sniping world . Through Oscar X young Hakim rediscovered Islam , travelling with the black American to the mother shrine , Elijah Muhammad 's Temple Two in Chicago , or to the nearer , less majestic Temple Three in Milwaukee . Amid these conservatively suited brothers and reserved , chastely gowned and turbanned sisters , the future Ellellou , welcomed and yet set apart as an African , found reminiscence of his deserted continent 's dignity , its empty skies and savannas , its beautiful browns.  |p143Subsequent  palavering in the stirred-up caravan failed to discoverany purpose to the raid . Nothing was taken , not so much as a camel-bag . A number of empty bottles  --  MocxoBexax , they said , Oco6ax BoRxa  --  dropped by the shouting , shooting camel-riders muffled in tagilmusts had the hollow glitter of a deliberate clue . " Either , " the President confided to Sheba , " they were Tuareg drunk on CIA bribes , or CIA operatives wishing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the clumsy effrontery of these telltale leavings wish to suggest that they are CIA operatives . " Sidi Mukhtar had another thought . " You know , " he said , " still slave-raiders in Balak . " Mellon scoffed . " That all died out with Tippu Tib . " " Not all , " the caravan leader said , some hidden cause for humor creasing the withered rascal 's features . " More selective now . Quality market instead of quantity . " " But who would they be after ? " Ellellou asked , feigning innocence of the knowledge that he himself , the President , was the caravan 's prize . Sidi Mukhtar winked toward the disguised dictator 's tent . " Fine woman , " he said simply . Shadows , angels , dangers , trucks on the road , radio waves in the air slip by us . The incident had the quality , an impalpableslithering-by , of those Wisconsin nights when , outside in the snow no whiter than Candy 's hips and flanks as they gleamed within the erotic turmoil of bedsheets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon the bricks , the ivy , the windowsills , the steeples and silos of sleeping Franchise . In their senior year Candy had received permission to rent a room off-campus , with another girl , who for erotic reasons of her own was much in Green Bay . The room , above a realtor 's office , was until this intrusion of blue black and white . The black lover would lift himself on an arm , the white belovedp144would lift her head , to recall him to their act , their intimacy , which had nothing to do with the tumult of which a fragment had poured past , and of which other fragments  --  the pulsing red lights of fire engines or of an ambulance  --  would in a minute follow . In this minute the frames of the prints , the mirrors , the wallpaper pattern in this room showed gray , gray on gray , the brightest gray the rectangles of the windowpanesthat sealed them off from the world outside , whose murderous confusions swept by like the giant wings of a snowstorm . Their love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sirens passed . Were the police coming for him ? He was aware that in some of these States skins of different colors rubbing was a crime . For his penis in her vagina there could be a rope around his neck . Nor did the Black Muslims condone copulating out of the faith , let alone with a blue-eyed she-devil . It was a conflict-making delight of his years here , being driven by Oscar X through the white man 's fat landscape in a battered but capacious and powerful ' 49 Oldsmobile , while the radio poured forth Dinah Washingtonand Kay Starr , heading toward a temple of Islam in the slums of some Midwestern metropolis , where they might be frisked by grim Irish police or held up at knifepoint by unconvertedjuvenile delinquents of their own color . Dangers everywhere , slipping and sliding by . Felix had perceived through the shadows a stain of blood on the bedsheet . Indeed , she had felt different tonight , not her usual just-tight-enough lubricity , but her wetness somehow rougher than usual , clotted . Unclean . Involuntarily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You should thank God . Up to this morning I was afraid I was pregnant . " " Wow , " he said , Americanized . She wanted to squeeze even more intimacy out of the revelation , to win more praise , for a fear endured . " Is that allp145you can say ? You know , it 's a rotten thing , to be a woman . You ca n't run away from your body . And the worst thing  --  " " The worst thing , dear Candy ? " " Never mind . " " The worst thing was , you did n't want to be carrying a black baby ? " " No , I 'd rather like that , as a matter of fact . " " Then what was this worst thing ? " " I wo n't tell you . " She left the bed to get a cigarette . In the room whose dimness seemed a cubic volume of smoke , her body , crossing to the bureau , was pale , loose , lithe . She struck a match . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was n't sure who the father was . " A police car bleated in the white night , more distantly . It did not take very many minutes of verbal struggle , as he remembered the incident , for him to elicit from her that the other possible father had been Craven . Sheba had been too stoned to feel much alarm during the raid . As the spanking , whining sound of rifle fire receded , and violent silhouettes ceased to be projected through the dim prism-shaped volume of the tent , she bit my shoulder to suggest that I could withdraw the protective mass of my body from on top of hers . She shook some of the sand from her elaborate coiffure of tiny braids pinned into parabolas , and to revive herself for the night 's trek popped a kola nut . With slack-jawed rapture she chewed , dying the inside of her mouth a deeper shade of gray . Along with her supply of Liberian kola nuts she had a bundle of Ethiopian khat and , for back-up , some Iranian bhang . Her gentle spirit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her squat showed me betweenp146the parted roundnesses of the thighs her exquisite genitals , underparts profiled in two bulges , the cleft barely masked by the gauze of a thousand perfect circlets . Seeing me stare , Sheba laughed and , without abandoning the rapture of kolachewing , urinated on the desert sand . In my madness of thirst , of love , I reached forward with cupped hands to rescue some of the liquid , though I knew from tales of other travellers that urine was as acid as lemon juice . It haunted my mouth for a burning hour . I went outside to discuss the raid . Sidi Mukhtar showed me the vodka bottles in the sun , their highlights hot as laser beams . I returned to the tent , where sweet Sheba , mellower , sang to the melancholy creak of her anzad : " Do it to me , baby , do it , do it . Take that cold knife from its sheath , stick it in me underneath , backwards , frontwards , down my throat , this trip has gone ontoo long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time by tapping the pummel of my camel-saddle , concerned oranges , an orange imagined this time as shrivelled , and so infested by insects it hums like a spherical transistor radio , until its substance is consumed and the shell , brittle and stippled , shatters , like a clay myrrh-holder from ancient Meroe . Our fellows in the caravan , wearying of cursing the raiders and vowing highly anatomical revenge , gathered at the tent-flap , and tossed in to us fistfuls of obsolete coinage , cowrie shells and tiny mirrors , and pre-devaluation lu with its Swiss-tooled profile of King Edumu , his head as bodiless on these coins as it was in reality . The caravan drivers , porters , guards , navigators , blacksmiths ,  |p147leather-workers  , translators , accountants , and quality-controllersall lusted growlingly after my Sheba , who contrived while laying double- and triple-stopped fingerings upon the neck of the anzad simultaneously to expose one bare foot and braceletedankle . These men , their faces mere slivers of baked skin and decayed teeth showing through the folds of their galabiehs and keffiyehs , crowded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one . He fell like a stick lightly stuck in the sand , and fainted ; so weakened were we all by the hardships of the Balak . Then came at last the water bag , the swallowed streams of paradise , the rogue 's lascivious nudge of my wife 's pendulousbreasts , the sunset prayers , the saddling up , the by now automatically deft repacking of our armful of effects into capacious khoorgs , the tying fast of the rolled tent-hides . Our camels suffered their cinched burdens with a thirupping of their lips and a batting of their Disneyesque eyelashes . From afar Sidi Mukhtar hallooed . The moon showed its silver crescent . The night 's advance had begun . These details are not easy to reconstruct , as I write where I do , with its distractions of traffic , its onmbrelles and promenadingproteges , its tall drinks of orange Fanta and seltzer water braced with a squid-squirt of anisette . But in the listeninghalf of my brain a certain jointed , clanking rhythm of our days remains , a succession of ordained small concussions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the line , avowing our readiness to march , with certain death the penalty for falling out of our musical chain of snorting , swayingcamels and cajoling , whirling guides . But 0 the desert stars ! What propinquous glories ! Tremulousglobes overseeing our shadowy progress with their utter silence . More than chandeliers , chandeliers of chandeliers . Urn al-Nuju n , the Mother of Stars , ran as a central vein , a luminousrift , within a sky , black as a jeweller 's display velvet , thatp148everywhere yielded , to the patient , astounded eye , more stars , so that the smallest interval between two luminaries was subdivided , and subdivided again , by the appearance of new points , leading awed scrutiny inward to a scale by which the blur in Andromeda became an oval immensity whose particle suns could be numbered . Under such a filigree our papery line of silhouettes passed , camel-bells softly chuckling , through the nocturnal escarpments and craters , wearily disturbing the undisturbed sand . Sheets of lava rose around us like apparitions , eruptions through a crystalline mantle whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sandstone testifiedto a Paleozoic ocean ; deeply cut dry canyons proved that once in some ghostly humid time great rivers had watered the Massif . Scaley defiles , of shale a-gleam as if wet , suddenlygave way to giddying views , immense gray bowls of emptiness sweeping to the next jagged , starlit range . What meant so much inhuman splendor ? But when the earth is crushed to fine dust , and your Lord comes down with the angels in their ranks , and Hell is brought near  --  on that day man will remember his deeds . My life by those lunar perspectivesbecame a focus of terror , an infinitely small point neverthelessenormously hollow , a precipitous intrusion of some substance totally alien and unwelcome , into these rocks , these fantastic orbs of fire , this treacherous ground of sand . I could not have withstood the solitude , the monotony , the huge idiocy of this barren earth , had not Sheba been by my side , sullen and warm . I loved in her what the others , the cruel illiterates of the desert , scented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a political space that sent its emissaries out to bargain for her body and her honor , Sheba had a space that asked no tending , that supported a nomadic traffic of music and drugs . Such a woman is an orphan of Allah , a sacred object . Sheba never questioned , never reflected . I said to her , " The stars . Are they not terrible ? "  | " No . Why ? " " So vast , so distant . Each is a sun , so distant that its light , travelling faster than the fastest jinni , takes years to reach our eyes . " " Even if such a lie were true , how would it affect us ? " " It means we are less than dust in the scheme of things . " She shrugged . " What can be done , then ? " " Nothing , but to pray that it not be so . " " So that is why you pray . " " For that , and to reassure the people of Kush . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Muslim , unbelief is like a third eye . Impossible . " We swayed in silence . Our fatigue was a tower to which each night added another tier . I said , " And do you know , there are laws all about us ? Laws of energy and light , laws that set these rocks here , and determined their shape , and their slant . Once an ocean lay down many grains of sand ; once the bodies of more small creatures than there are stars above us laid down their skeletons to form islands , great shoals , which volcanoes lifted up , and then the wind wore down again , and water that rained , and flowed , and vanished . Once all this was green , and men hunted elephants and antelope , and drew pictures of themselves on the rocks . " " Show me such a picture . " " They are hard to find . I have seen them in books . " " Things can be made up and put into books . I want to see a picture on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one . But what I am saying is more than that once men hunted and even fished here . I am saying that perhaps again this will be true , and we will be forgotten , all of us forgotten , of less account than the camels whose hides make up our tents . Past and future are immense around us , they are part of the laws I speak of , that are more exact than anything you know , they are like those rocksp150that when you split them come away exactly flat . Everything obeys these laws . Things grow by these laws , and things die by them . They are what make us die . We are caught inside them , like birds in a cage  --  no , like insects in a cage that is all bars , that has no space inside , like a piece of rotten wood , only not rotten but hard , harder than the hardest rock . And the rock , one single rock , stretches out to those stars , and beyond , for in truth they seem very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those same laws continue , and continue to crush us , finer than the finest dust , finer than the antimony you use to make your eyelids gray . Help me , Sheba . I am sinking . " " I do what I can . But you make what I do seem very little . " " No , it is much . " After a pause , while the feet of our steeds slithered on the cold sand , she asked me , " When do you think we will reach our destination ? " " We will reach it , " I told her , " when there is no farther to go . " " And how will we know when that is ? " " The drought , " I told her , " will have ended . " In the home of Candace 's parents , where she took me late in our freshman year , the white woodwork was like a cage also . I marvelled at the tightness , the finish . Her father came toward me from rooms away , a big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thin and light it wandered across his skull as he gestured . I had the impression that his bigness was composed of many soft places , bubbles in his flesh where alcohol had fermented and expanded ; he shook my hand with too much force , overcarrying . " So you 're the young man my daughter has been raving about , " he said . Raving ? I looked at Candy 's pointed polite face , whose straight fine nose had come from her mother ; I had just met the lady , who seemed afraid . Maybe the something bloated and patchy about the Dad was fear too . We were all afraid.  |p151I  was alarmed , as the house opened to me  --  its woodwork interlocked like the lattice of an elaborate trap ; its pale , splashy , furtively scintillating wallpaper ; its deep , fruit-colored , step-squelching carpets ; its astonishing living-room , long and white , two white sofas flanking a white marble coffee table bearing porcelain ashtrays and a set of brass scales holding white lilies whose never-wilt lustre was too good to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tiny straight sides and bottoms of cork , scattered everywhere , on broad sofa arms and circular end tables , as if some giant had bestowed on the room the largesse of his intricate , oversize coinage ? " Daddy , I would n't say raving , ' " Candy corrected , embarrassed , her face , that I now perceived as a clash of genes , blushing . " Rave is what she does , Mr.  --  I do n't want to mispro-nounce . " " Call me Felix , " I said , Anglicizing the e . I wondered if I should sit , and would the sofa swallow me like some clothy crocodile ? Often in America , in drugstores and traffic jams , I had the sensation of being within a bright , voracious , manytoothedmaw . The Cunninghams ' living-room had puddles of cosmetic odor here and there . As in the old cinema palace on Commerce Street , a heroic stagnation had overtaken decor . Seating myself on the edge of the bottomlessly spongy sofa , I touched the brass scales and , sure enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it had been polished , welded , and loaded with plastic lilies . Fixed forever , like that strange Christian heaven , where nothing happened , not even the courtship of houris . " Asseyez-vous , " Mrs. Cunningham had suggested , with a smile touchingly like her daughter 's , only somehow uneven , as if Candy 's quick smile had been crumpled up and then retrieved and smoothed and pasted over a basic frown . But when I responded , in textbook French , complimentingp152my hostess on the beauty of her room and its florid and cinematicappointments , her visage went as blank as that of the enamelled shepherdess on the mantel , frozen in a pose of alert unheeding vis-a-vis the fluting shepherd in the exactly correspondingmantel position . Between them stood an impressive clock with a pendulum of mercury rods , and its action may have been interfering , on their chilly elfin plane , with the call of the shepherd 's piping . The fireplace itself , the hearth whose symbolic domestic centrality was so primitive that even I might have found here a familiar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ornamented with unscathed brass andirons supporting three perfect birch logs that would never be burned . Mr. Cunningham restored the conversation to solid English . " Feelicks , if I 'm not being too personal , what 's your major going to be at McCarthy ? " " Freshman are not required to declare , but I had thought Government , with a minor in French Literature . " " French Literature , what the hell use would that be to your people ? Government , I can see . Good luck with it . " " In the strange climate of my native land , Mr. Cunningham , the literature the French brought us may transplant better than the political institutions . There is a dryness in Racine , a harshnessin Villon , that suits our case . In French Indochina , not many years ago , I had the experience of trading memorized sonnets by Ronsard with a prisoner of war , a terrorist who was later executed . In the less developed quarters of the world , the power politics of the West can be brushed aside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Mrs. Cunningham began with the overemphasis of the shy , having seated herself in a wing chair patterned in cabbage-sized roses , her lean shins laid gracefully , diagonally together with a dainty self-conscious " sexiness " that reminded me of her daughter . . . who had vanished ! Horreur ! Where ?  |p153I  could hear her voice dimly giggling in some far reach of the house . She had gone upstairs , it later transpired , to talk with her " kid " brother ; or was it into the kitchen , to renew acquaintance with the Cunninghams ' colored cook ? At any rate , she had left me alone with her terrifying pale parents , the female of whom was posed in mid-sentence , and who now settled on the verb she had paused to locate among her treasury of " nice " things  --  " alluded to your romantic adventures . " " Not romantic , Madame ; dreary , truly . The French in exchangefor their poems asked that we fight in other poor countries . I obliged them in Indochina , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it came to Algeria , where the rebels were fellow Africans , I became a rebel myself , and deserted . " " Oh dear , " Mrs. Cunningham said . " Can you ever go back ? " " Not until the colonial power departs . But this may happenwithin the decade . All it needs is a politician in Paris who is willing to act as a mortician . In the meantime , I enjoy your amazing country as a dream from which I will some day wake miraculously refreshed . " " There 's a question I 'm rarin ' to ask you , " Mr. Cunningham said , rising ominously , but not to throttle me , as his growling tone for a second implied to my alert nerves , but to move to a tall cabinet and get himself another drink , from a square bottle whose first name was Jack , or was it Jim ? The riddle of my own name he informally solved with , " How about you , fella ? " My mouth was indeed dry , from unease . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He threatened to balk . " Plain water ? " Then his mind embracedmy response , as something he might have expected , from an underprivileged delegate from the childlike underworld . " Would n't you rather have a 7-Up ? Or a Schlitz ? " I would have , and brushed from my own mind the miragep154of a beer sitting golden on a dark table of the Badger Cafe ; but I felt the family dinner ahead of me stretch like a long trek through a bristling wilderness of glass and silver and brittle remarks , and had resolved upon sobriety as my safeguard . Also there was some silent satisfaction in impeding this big white devil 's determination to be hospitable . " Just water , if you please , " I insisted . " Your religion , I suppose ? " " Several of them . " " Some ice in it ? " he asked . " No ice , " I said , again against my desires , but in conformity with an ideal austerity I had grown like a carapace , in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , with unexpected euphony ; his obedient wife arose  --  the shepherdess did hear the shepherd  --  and went into the kitchen , which seemed to be , by one of those inscrutablejurisdictions whereby American couples order the apparent anarchy of their marriages , her province . Mr. Cunningham , freshly reinforced by his bottled cohort , pursued his interestingquestion , which was , " What do you make of our American colored people ? " I had already enough converse with the disciples of Elijah Muhammad to hear the word " colored " as strange , but this strangeness was swallowed by the expanding strangeness of the preceding " our . " I looked at my feet , for I was travelling in treacherous territory . My search for an answer was needless , for Mr. Cunningham was providing it . " What can we do , " he was asking me , " to help these people ? They move into a nice neighborhood and turn it into a jungle . You pour millions of state money in and it goes up in smoke . Our American cities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great town . They 've turned it into a hellhole , you get mugged by these kids right in Hudson 's , the downtown isp155a wasteland . Chicago 's going the same way . Hyde Park , all around the university , these lovely homes , a white girl ca n't walk her dog after supper without a knife in her stocking . The Near North Side 's a little better , but two blocks in from the Lake you 're taking your life in your hands . Why do you think I moved the family up to Oshkosh ? I lost forty grand a year by leaving the city . But hell , the rates on real estate were going out of sight , the only way to get your money out of some of those neighborhoods was burn ' em down . Cars , anybody who keeps a car on the street should have his head examined . They would n't just steal ' em , they 'd smash ' em up  --  pure spite . What 's eating the bastards ? You 'd love to know . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a silver rim , and I thought of desert water holes , the brackishness , the camel prints in the mud , the bacterial slime that somehow even across the burning sands manages to find its live way . Mr. Cunningham 's tone tightened a little , with his wife 's return . There was this flattering about his tirade : that he was addressing me as a fellow sufferer , that the heat of his grievancehad burned away my visible color . He went on , " I 've had my knocks up here , trying to make a name coming in cold in the middle of life ; but at least I 'm not afraid my daughter 's going to be raped and do n't have to lock the car every time I stop to take a piss at a gas station . " " Frank , " Alice said . " Sorry , there , but I guess even over in the Sahara you know what a piss is . " " Nous buvons le pissat , " I said , smiling . " Exactly , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his wife . " Anyway , where was I ? Yeah , my question : What 's the solution for these people ? " " Provide them useful work ? "  |p156Made  in all timidity , this suggestion seemed to tip him toward fury . His patchy look intensified , his hair fluffed straight up . " Christ , they wo n't take the jobs there are , they 'd rather rake in welfare . Your average Chicago jigaboo , he 's too smart to dirty his paws ; if he ca n't pimp or hustle drugs , or land some desk job with dingbat Daley , he 'll just get his woman pregnant and watch the cash roll in . " " That is  --  what do you call it ?  --  American individualism , is it not ? And enterprise , of an unforeseen sort . " He stared at me . He was beginning to see me . " Christ , if that 's enterprise , let 's give it all over to the Russians . They 've got the answer . Concentration camps . " " Daddy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; for she had come down the stairs , freshly brushed , her face alight with the happiness of " home , " her crimson lips renewed , her rounded slim body bouncy as a cheerleader 's , in a cashmere sweater and a pleated wool skirt , which swirled as she swung herself around the newel post whose carpentered pirouette I had admired upon entering . " Would n't what , dear ? " her mother asked , as if straining to hear , in this room of silent clocks and chiming resemblances . " Would n't bother . Happy about the Chicago blacks . " " Not just Chicago , " her father protested , " it 's lousy everywhere . Even L.A. , they 're pulling it under . Hell , Chicago at least . has , a political machine , to make payoffs and keep some kind of lid on . In a city like Newark , they 've just taken over . They 've done to Newark what we did to Hiroshima . Grass does n't even grow where they are . They are the curse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to our friend here . " " Daddy , you are so ignorant and prejudiced I just ca n't even cry about it anymore . I did n't want to bring Happy here but Mother said I must . You make me very ashamed in front of him . "  | " Happy , hell , he 's out of it . He 's an African , at least they got some pride over there . As he says , they have their own culture . The poor colored in this country , they got nothing but what they steal . " And he not quite drunkenly winked at me . It crossed my mind that I , as an African , was being thanked because I had not come over here to stay and raise the automotive insurance rates with my thievery ; more , he saw me as the embodiment of the mother continent that yearned , he hoped , to take the Afro-Americans back into a friendly , oozy chaos .

" Nothing but what they steal . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perspective on the room , and was freshly overwhelmed by its exotisme , its fantasy , the false flowers and fires , the melting-iceberg shapes of its furniture , its whiteness and coldness and magnificent sterility ; the emptiness , in short , of its lavish fullness , besprinkledwith those inexplicable cork coins . I express this badly . The wet ring from a glass of Fanta has blurred my manuscript . I long to get back to the Bad Quarter of Kush , and the spaces of my dear doomed Sheba . The " kid " brother had followed Candy downstairs . Frank Jr . was a furtive , semi-obese child of fourteen  --  old enough , in my village , for the long house  --  whose complexion showed the ravages of sleeping alone , night after night , in an overheated room with teddy bears , felt pennants , and dotted Swiss curtains . The smile he grudged me displayed a barbarous , no doubt painful tooth-armor of silver and steel . His limp dank handshake savored of masturbatory rites . His eyes were fishy with boredom , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which I knew , despite my color , nothing . For this family occasion the child had put on a shirt and tie ; the collar and knot cut cruelly into the doughy flesh of his neck . I thought , Here is the inheritor of capitalism and imperialism , of thep158Crusades and the spinning jenny . Yet he did not so much seem Mr. Cunningham in embryo as Mr. Cunningham , with his quirky bravado , desperate wish to be liked , and somehow innocentlythinned and scattered hair , seemed a decaying , jerrybuiltexpansion of his son . I perceived that a man , in America , is a failed boy . Then a black woman came into the alabaster archway of the living-room . For all the frills of her uniform , she looked familiar , with her heavy lower lip and fattening charms . Her uncanny resemblance to Kadongolimi was reinforced by her manner , which implied that she had had many opportunities in life and might well , with equal contentment , be elsewhere . " Dinner , ma'am . " We all stood , in obedience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mrs. Cunningham , with a predatory deftness that showed a whole new piece of her equipment for survival , had silently as a pickpocket knifed behind me and placed my empty water glass , which I had set down in the center of an end table beside a sofa arm , securely within one of the little cork-and-silver saucers . Of course . They were " coasters , " which in the friendly bars of Franchise took the form of simple discs of advertisement-imprinted blotting paper . By such sudden darts into the henceforth obvious , anthropologyproceeds . Oscar X took the future E11ellou to meetings of the Nation of Islam ; they disliked the term Black Muslims , though both " black " and " Muslim " seemed canonical . Temple Three , in Milwaukee , was two hours to the south , but another rushing , radio-flooded hour , in that many-knobbed , much-rusted , lavishlychromate guzzler of essence called , I thought oddly in a nation obsessed with the new , an Olds , took us to Templep159Two , in Chicago , where the Messenger of Allah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a small delicate man with some resemblance , I was to notice when I awoke in Noire , to Edumu IV , Lord of Wanjiji . The Messenger wore an embroideredgold fez . He was a frail little filament who burned with a pure hatred when he thought of white men and lit up our hearts . He spoke of the white man 's " tricknology . " He told us that the black man in America had been so brainwashed by the blue-eyed devils he was mentally , morally , and spirituallydead . He spoke of a nation of black men , carved from the side of America like a blood-warm steak from the side of an Ethiopian steer , that would exist on a par with the other nationsof the world . He rehearsed the services the black man had performed for his slavemasters in the United States , from cooking their meals and suckling their babies ( yes ) to building their levees and fighting their wars ( yes indeed ) . He mocked the civil-rights movements , the " sitting-in , " " lying-in , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a slavemasterwho on the one hand demands separate schools , beaches , and toilets and on the other hand through the agency of rape had so mongrelized the American black man that not a member of this audience was the true ebony color of his African fathers . " Little Lamb ! " souls in our crowd would cry out , and " Teach , Messenger ! " The litany of wrongs never wearied him , this shambling gold-fezzed foreshadow of my king . At his mention of rape , I would find myself crying . At his mention of the tribe of Shabazz , for which the word " Negro " was a false and malicious label , I would find myself exultant . At his amazed soft recounting of some newly arisen marvel of devilish hypocrisy , such as the then recent Supreme Court decision which told black men they were integrated and thus opened them up to the sheriff 's dogs when they were such fools as to take their little scrubbed and pigtailed daughtersp160to school , or such ancient marvels of Christian tricknology as the mixing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that no two spoke the same language or remembered the same gods , so that no idol remained to these slaves but the white devil 's blue-eyed , yellow-haired , historically grotesque Jesus , I would find myself wild with visions of what must be done , of sleepingmillions to be awakened from their brainwashing , of new nations founded on the rock of vengeance and led by such quiet brown hate-inspired men as this , our Messenger . And on Tuesday nights ( Unity Nights ) or Friday nights ( Civilization Nights ) it was pleasant to mingle , and even to be cossetted as an African with a smattering of Arabic , among the beige-gowned women and dark-suited men who had redeemedthemselves from the flash and ruin of the ghetto . Ex-criminals , many of them , they moved with the severity of sous-officiers , and I realized that , in this era when the magic wand is hollow and all wizards , chiefs , and Pharaohs went tumbling under the gun 's miraculous bark , the army is the sole serious institution left  --  all others are low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The United States takes noisy pride in its sack-suited government of lawyers and fixers , but the bulky blue army of police is what the citizen confronts . Their patrol cars bleat past every lulled couple 's fornication nest . Their baby-faced officers waddle across Commerce Street with waistfuls of leather-swaddled armaments . Beyond these blue men , for my black friends , the government was a gossamer of headlines spun like fresh cobwebseach morning , and brushed away by noon . I perceived this then : government is mythological in nature . These stepchildrenof Islam were seeking to concoct a counter-myth . " Al-salamu alaykum ! " The Messenger 's greeting rolled back : " Wa-alaykum al-salami " I had never heard Arabic , which in Africa stings like a whip wielded by slavers and schoolteachers ,  |p161s|poken  so sweetly as here , in America , in the flat rote accents of children of janitors and sharecroppers , who had memorized their few phrases as the passwords into self-reliance and dignity . Takbir ! God is great ! Ma she ' allah : it is as God wills . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ankle-weary work-day kitchen slaves of white homes , all had a flavor of charade , it was a purposeful earnest charade , and with altogether another taste too , a sacred spicy something that prickled in my nostrils and made me , enacting my own charade as an authentic Child of the Book , feel more exalted , more serenely myself , than I did , in this treacherous land of kafirs , anywhere else . Although Oscar X , I years later learned , gave up the Faith in disgust at the Messenger 's well-authenticated sexual lapses , and some of my chaste sisters have put on again the white robes of the Christian choir , and my earnest lean-faced brothers ( their eyes glittering above their cheekbones like snipers levelling their sights , their dangerous nervousness sheathed in the quiet devil-garb of corporation lawyers and FBI men ) have re-enlisted in the guerrilla war of the streets  --  though the Nation of Islam took a mortal wound when it became Malcolm 's killer , and the Afro-American 's misery moved on in its search for the revolutionary instrument @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Messenger disclosed to me riches that were , unbeknownst , mine . He taught me that the evils I had witnessed were not accidental but intrinsic . He showed me that the world is our enslaver , and that the path to freedom is the path of abnegation . He taught me nationhood , purity , and hatred : for hatred is the source of all strengths , and its fruit is change , as love is the source of debility , and its fruit is passive replication of what already too numerously exists . At temple meetings , on vacation from Candy Cunninghamp162and McCarthy College with their noble schemes for my transformation into a white-headed , lily-livered black man , I was free to imagine myself in an absolutist form . Crystals of dreaming erected within me , and the nation of Kush as it exists is the residue of those crystals . The terrain became more mountainous ; the patches of thornbush , the scant tufts of the world 's dullest flowers , no longer could draw the least excuse for life from the gray rocks , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shattering rocks gave staccato echo to the scrabble of the camels trying to keep their footing on millennial accumulations of scree . We rattled as we went , and Sheba 's anzad ( varied now and then by an end-blown flute that doubled as a dildo in the face of my impotence ) eerily harmonized with the stony music our passage struck from the resonant minerals and crystals jutting around us . Haematite , magnetite , kassiterite , wolframite , muscovite , mispickel , and feldspars cast their glints by moonlight . I recalled Ezana 's dark geological allusions , and wondered how my old Minister of the Interior was faring in captivity . We had shared the same caserne , heard together the call , " Aux armes ! Aux armes ! Les diables jeunes ! " Sentimentalreflections of all sorts coursed through my weary soul . The moons waxed and waned ; Dhu ' 1-Hi ) ja became Muharram , Muharram became Safar , or else I had lost count . The waterholescouts ranged away from the caravan for days , and some never returned . The moment was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seek out the cave where the head of Edumu IV reportedly babbled oracles . In the vicinity of the cave , Sidi Mukhtar told us , European rock doves had gathered , and now one or two of these birds , gray , but with points of lustre on the head and throat thatp163bubbled up , in this monochromatic climate , to the verge of iridescence , could be seen at dusk and dawn , dotting a distant slope of speckled asphalt-colored shale like pigeons in the lee of chimneys on city roofs . Up and down we wound our way through alleylike passes so narrow the sky was reduced to the width of a river above our heads . The ordeal was aging Sheba : the baby fat of trust had fallen from her cheeks ; some of the looks she darted at me sideways , through the asynchronousheaving of our camels ' humps , were positively dubious . " Do you love me ? " Candy would ask . " Tell me what you mean by love , " young Hakim would counter , his emotional defenses well fortified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Einstein , a steady explosion , the sheltering gods all shattered . " What do you mean , what do I mean ? " Follow-up emergency vehicles wailed by on the street below . Their spinning red lights dyed the icicles at the windowa bloody red : fangs of a deep-throated growl . " To what extent , " he pursued , " is your so-called love for me love of yourself , yourself in the Promethean stance of doing the forbidden , that is , of loving me ? " " To what extent , I could ask in turn , is your fucking me revenging yourself on the white world ? " " Is that what your parents suggest ? " " They do n't know . They do n't ask . After a certain age it 's easier for them to forget you have a body . Marriage would be the only crunch . " " Indeed . " " What do you mean , Indeed ' ? " " I mean , indeed , marriage would be a crunch . " He changed the subject , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This fucking to avenge oneself , I think that is an American style . I do not have , that I can detect , the sexual sense ofp164outrage that our friends Oscar and Turnip and Barry bear toward the white man , whom they call , simply , the Man . The brown-faced Arabs were butchering and carrying off my people while the French were innocently constructing Chartres . The Tuareg have been more ruthless still . They are white , beneath their blue robes . In my land the black man is the Man , who performs generation after generation the super stunt of continuing to exist , to multiply among the pain and the heat . Noire is a river where others come to fish , but they do not swim with us . " " Touch me while you talk . Please , Happy . " He touched her white flank , from which the reflected red pulsing had ebbed . " In the village , " he said , in his weariness surrendering to the first words that came , " we were always touching one another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thirteen the boys earn the right to sleep as an age-set , in the long house . I often think of your brother , the sadness of him sleeping alone , in a room all his . To emerge from such solitude into sexuality must be a great arrival , greater than in other nations , too poor to have so many rooms . And then the middleagedof America do not touch either . At the end , the nurses and doctors handle you . It is a sign the darkness of the womb is being approached again . " She turned her back and her skin felt cold as a snake 's . She had wanted to talk about marriage . Pyrolusite , goethite , antimonite , quartz : Sidi Mukhtar named the crystals , winking . " Much treasure . " He tapped the cliff . He had once fallen in with Rommel 's armies and been trained in geology , in Erdwissenschaft . He had grown fond of the anzad player and her little protector . He was sorry to see them leave the caravan . But the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later learned from reliable sources , Michaelis Ezana was making his way through the midnightcorridors of the Palais d'Administration des Noires . He had persuaded his guards , two Golo simpletons who had been shifted from the rat-killing detail at one of the surplus-peanut mounds on the plains near Al-Abid , that a six o'clock martini was a kind of internal ablution which should , for ultimate purity , be taken with the saldt al-maghrib . Day by day he increased the proportion of gin to vermouth to the point where the stout fellows , hardened imbibers of honey beer , toppled . His way was clear . As once before in these pages , as perceived from this same window , the muezzins ' twanging call echoed under the cloudless sky as under a darkening dome of tile . Rather than risk confrontation with the soldiers and their doxies quartered in the fourth-floor corridor , who , if not fully alerted to the nuance shifts of inner-circle leadership in Kush , certainly had caught the smoky whiff of tabu that now attached to Ezana , he , by a series of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these sentences were maddeningly distended by seemingly imperative refinements and elaborations in the middle , constructed a rope of caftans and agals and descended , through the silver kiss of the last moon of Safar , down the wall , in his terrified descent accompanied by his indifferent shadow , a faint large bat-shape whose feet touched his abrasively . Ezana attained , without the makeshiftrope 's breaking , a window of the third floor , which housed the People 's Museum of Imperialist Atrocities . As he had in descending prayed , the window was unfastened ; or , rather , the catch had long since come loose from the wood , baked by the daily heat to the friability of clay . He pushed it open with a crackle and , trembling , dropped to the floor inside . Few visited the Museum but nostalgic reactionaries . Thep166leather trappings on the French parade harness had been nibbled and consumed by the starving . The little model , meant to scandalize with its penury , of the typical servants ' hut circa 1910 had been carefully dismantled and smuggled outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ urban homeless . The torturing apparatus , dominated by a gaunt dental drill , and the guillotine , Gothic pinnacle of Gallic justice , cast the longest shadows as the Minister of the Interior stole barefoot among the dusty museum cases . The cases contained lumps of rubber and gypsum and other raw materials gouged from Noire by naked workers ( shown in a miniature tableau , balsawoodbodies expiring of exhaustion at the mouth of a papiermachemine ) paid a few centimes a day . An entire case was filled with centimes . Another case held only imperialist mustachesand monocles ; these latter winked as Ezana 's shadow soundlessly passed . The next case held emptied bottles of the colons ' ungodly poisons  --  absinthe , cognac , champagne , Perrierwater ; their glimmer was doused and rekindled again as Ezana , his heart thumping , slid by . In other cases , more darkly , lurked Bibles and missals in their pernicious range of sizes and languages ; displayed with them , wittily , were the ledgers of the army of the profiteers , the plantation managers , the concessionnaires @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cutlery in the remote villages , the shipping lines that creakily plied the Grionde . Ezana had once made a study of these ledgers , and after some consultation with Ellellou had suppressed this curious finding : none showed a profit . On paper , colonialism was a distinctly losing venture . The cost of the armies , the administrators , the flags , the forts , the bullets , the roads , the quinine , the imported knives , forks , and spoons , quite outweighed the grudging haul of raw materialsand taxes elicited from the unprincipled , evasive chiefs and stubbornly inefficient populace . The most rapacious ex/ploiter of them all , King Leopold , who permitted appalling atrocities in an attempt to balance his books , had to be rescued from bankruptcy . As the colonies were jettisoned into independence , the ledgers of the metropolitan capitals registered distinct relief . The most outre region of France Outre-nzer , Noire , had been , in Paris , a minor statistical nuisance . Why , then , had the oppressors come ? As Ezana moved barefoot through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his feet , their soles , for too many years cradled in Italian leather , made tender by the daring descent down the rough inner face of the Palais . The Europeans had come , it seemed , out of simple jealousy ; the Portuguese had a fort or two , so the Danes and Dutch had to have forts . Egypt fell to the British , so the French had to have the Sahara ; because the British had Nigeria , the Germans had to have Tanganyika . But what , then , was there to do with these vast tracts ? Drain swamps , shoot elephants , plant cocoa , clear the way for missionaries . In Noire these activities had been carried forward in the most attenuated way : there were few swamps , and fewer elephants . Nevertheless the Gauls had gone through the motions , and a handful of Frenchmen who at home would have been outcasts here established , on the backs of blacks little more aware of their presence than of flies on their skins , a precarious , shrill self-importance . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brutal cicotte , a length of hippo hide for flogging plantation workers into line , to the dainty silken fouet with which a regional administrator 's wife could chastise one of her maidservants , knots having been artfully braided into the ends of the threads . The next case contained obscene accessories of a brothel in Hurriyah maintained for white militia and laborers by the dusky autochtones . Contact , of a sort , had been made . Civilizationlike an avalanche of sludge had collapsed into the blankp168clean places of the maps . Skins rubbed as among sleepers with shut lids , thrashing and tugging at the covers . Along one dark wall there were great maps of the sub-Saharan empires , Songhai and Mali and Kanem-Bornu ; these too had been imposed from beyond and their rise and fall punctuated by the severing of many an ear , hand , and head . On this same wall hung daguerreotypes gone coppery and quaint , of frilly picnics in the bush , of military parades aligning multitudinous buttons , of a painter in the goatee and slack white shirt of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a beehive hut and a baobab tree . Stealthily past these images of an out-of-date intermingling Ezana crept , pondering the meaning of colonialism , the impossibility that a nation with the sublime literature and cuisine of France would subdue a scruffy sixth of an ungrateful continent in order to create flattering jobs for a few adventurous dregs , and the concomitant possibility that now this great land of Kush existed solely to give employment to a few revolutionary elitistslike himself . The memorials of imperial atrocities stretched out their shadows as if not to let him go as he eased back the massive hexagonal bolt on a door beneath an oil portrait of Governor Faidherbe , action shots of the Hourst expedition , and photostats of especially atrocious pages from Colonel Toutee 's famous diary . Ezana let himself stealthily into the corridor . It was empty . The flaking white ceiling , the green molding at the level of his hand , diminished toward infinity . Ghostly in his dirty prisoner 's robe , his eyes bugging in his curvilinear face , his wristwatch holding the exact time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moved close to the wall , pondering Ellellou , his leader 's far journey , the unlikelihood that he would reach his destination . He pondered his own survival , weighed the odds against a Palais coup . But Ezana had no wish to lead . To advise , to raise quiet objections while chocolate quietly cooled , to train typists ,  |p169sign  directives , pull rafts of allied statistics from the consoles of filing cabinets , to see a nation and all its nebulous load of baffled human consciousness reduced to rigorous alignments of nouns and numbers , and furthermore to dress like a dignitary , to appear on an odd denomination of postage stamp , and to have an embezzled fortune banked against the Day of Disaster in a numbered Swiss account  --  all this he liked , but not to lead . A leader is one who , out of madness or goodness , volunteers to take upon himself the woe of a people . There are few men so foolish ; hence the erratic quality of leadership in the world . Ezana furthermore did n't see that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truly changed the condition of mankind were achieved by anonymous men , accumulators of correct facts and minute improvements , men of unspectacular gifts who add the culminating touch and arrive at the nearly obvious conclusion while the charismatic sloganeers and lightning rods of the media go through their symbolic motions  --  paper gods consumed by the primeval conflagrationof human curiosity . They could be scrapped in a minute , but there would always be a place for a man like him . He crept along the corridor , and came at last to a stairway . Day-Glo-orange arrows pointed down and signs in six languagessaid DOWN ONLY . F.zana had reason to ask himself if indeed he did have a place . In his cheap robe of old merikani , its folds tapping his shaking knees and spherical buttocks , he felt transposed into that spatially vague afterlife so monotonouslyguaranteed by the rambling Mohamet . Did the stairway go down to the girls ' high school or to the prison where dissidentrural chiefs and adolescents addicted to contraband comic books underwent laborious courses of political re-education , with seminars on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Josef Stalin thrown in for second offenders ? Ezana had no business in either of these places ; his educationp170felt complete . Against all official indications he took the stairwayup , to the floor where his old offices were . The image of his old suite  --  the shag carpet , the glass-topped desk , the In basket , the Out basket , and the little tree of rubber stamps beside the postage scales  --  burned in his mind like an oasis in the imagination of a desert traveller . Once seated in that place , he could regrasp the levers of government . Ellellou , however far away , would feel the nation rumble under his feet , the gears of progress re-engaged . The contretemps concerning Gibbs and Klipspringer would pass like a woman 's petulance . He and Ellellou needed one another as the earth needs the sky , as the traveller needs the camel . One determines , the other implements . Already Ezana was beginning to feel snug , nestled back into place and reconnected to the power terminals . The first thing he must implement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cooling of Klipspringer . These Americans , they talk in billions , but turn out to have been " brainstorming . " No matter : the quick winds of Washington would blow him away , and another bargainer would take his place . As for the Russians , he would work to rid Kush of their boisterous mischief . Obstructionists and familiars of confusion , profiteers of all disarray , they were behind this melancholydistraction of the President , Ezana had no doubt . The superparanoids , he had once amusingly called the world 's presentsubdividers . He found them both gross , compared to the old imperialist powers , who in their chilly country houses and baroque chancelleries at least had partitioned the outgunned continents while being served delicacies beside which borscht and hamburger were so much dogfood . He was hungry , Ezana realized . He wound his way through three echoing turns of the cast-iron spiral stairs and came to a door of riveted plates , each stamped with Art Nouveau efflorations . These noodly motifs the French had brought , along with military science , thep171metric system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touch . Why ? Ezana wondered if his guards might have awoken from their comas and alerted the authorities . But what authorities ? The carpeted corridors , with their water-coolers and framed citations for bureaucratic excellence , their cork bulletin boards shingled with yellowing , curling inter-office memos and facetiously annotated clippings from Nouvelles en Noire et Blanche , were empty at this hour , like a valley whose inhabitantshave fled before the rumored invader could materialize . The narrow door of Ellellou 's ascetic office was shut , its frosted glass inscrutable , intact , dark . But behind the larger glass of Ezana 's own office door , two dozen steps along the corridor , past a circular table holding copies of Cuban and Bulgarian magazines whose covers featuredtawny beauties beaded with water on the beaches of the Black and Caribbean seas , a light burned . A guttural laugh , as from a ditch , arose within . He put his ear  --  abnormally small and infolded , even for a black man  --  against the glass . He heard beneath Kutunda 's laugh another voice , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , a party was in progress . Delicately Ezana opened the door and moved through his old anteroom to the inner office . There he was greeted by the dazzling sight of Kutunda in lacy red underwear , her hair bleached platinum and teased to a bouffant mass , bringing a wire basket of papers , like a cocktail waitress bringing hors d'oeuvres , to the man behind the desk . This was the oval-faced young man who had once read the Koran to the king ; he still wore his plum-colored fez and his expression of dense ebony calm , though in his hand was held , black and white and faintly blue , a gun . " We need each other , " he told Michaelis Ezana.  |p172SMERALDA  MILLER was an interesting color , a gray as ofiron filings so fine the eye could not detect the individualgrains . In Hakim 's fancy the tint , which savored of manufacture , was a by-product of her beliefs , her economic determinism . At the same time she was an attractive , ectomorphicyoung woman , with a lean prognathous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bewitching way of thoughtfully swaying her jaw , as if testing molar crowns her father had made for her . " What are you trying to achieve ? " she would ask the young deserter from Noire , across the table in the Off-Campus Luncheonette , or later in the Pure Dairy Products Ice Cream Parlor , or later still in the Badger Cafe , with its beer-soaked sawdust on the floor , and its bubbling , phosphorescent advertisements . " Messing around with this deluded bitch Candy . " " Achieve ? That 's a rather other-directed way of putting it . What did Freud say ? Pleasure is the removal of tension . Therep173is a tension that screwing her relieves . No doubt the sex has a component of vengeance , of tasting evil , of stealing Charlie 's prize , et cetera . From her side , kindred craziness . Still , we get along . " " She 's no prize , is what you ca n't see . She put the move on you in the first place . You just took it . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she 's got marriage in her eye . What happens when you graduate ? " " I have told her , more than once , that I am married . " " To some old black cow in the heart of nowhere ? This white girl no more cares about that woman than a bug under a rock . She does n't believe she exists , and neither do I. Anyway , who says you 're ever going back ? Let 's face it , Haps , you 're American as apple pandowdy . I try to talk sense to you friend to friend , and you give me back David Riesman and overheard Freud . I love you . " This last was said as lightly as these words can be said , as Bob Hope or Clark Gable says them , but Felix took them in , and understood her advice now as propaganda . He began to play with her . " As a Muslim , I am entitled to four wives . " " Shit . You 're about as Muslim as I am Daddy Warbucks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's just our usual native storefront I'm-comin ' - home- Jesus routine , with a few funny phrases thrown in . Inshallah , Walla-Walla . " " I do n't mock your faith , " he said stiffly . " Anyway , you 're wrong about my never going back . You do n't follow the African news in the back pages . The British have given in to Nkrumah , and de Gaulle has been brought to power to end the Algerian war . Only de Gaulle can face down the mili-tary . " " God , you 're impossible when you get on your great men kick . De Gaulle is just Ike with a bigger nose ; they are balloons . History is happening underneath . When the op/pressed peoples rise up , they will just take . Meanwhile , nobodyis giving them anything . France can bleed all it wants , international capital wo n't let it let go . " " International capital , I believe , has decided colonies are obsolete . The companies themselves , and their insidious products , are the new armies . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is no proletariat . Show me the proletariathere . You have the blacks , kept in ghettos because of a superstitious horror of their skins , their rolling eyes , their whiplike penises  --  " " Some are stubby , " Esmeralda said . " You have the Indians , " Felix went on , " who never knew what hit ' em . And you have the white workers , who Marx to the contrary are thoroughly enrolled in consumerism , making junk and buying junk , drinking junk and driving junk . That is the revolution , surely  --  the triumph of the unnecessary . If Marx could see his English proletariat now , he would n't recognizesuch softness , such silliness , soaked through and through with ale and the telly . He thought the proletariat was a sponge that would have to be squeezed until a revolutionran out . What happened instead is it sopped up some of the surplus its labor had created and bloated , in a spongy way . There is a kind of poisonous mush abroad in the planet , Esmeralda , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ devilish . It crowds out the good , it makes goodness impossible . Great fanatics can no longer arise ; they are swamped by distractions . " " There you go , into obscurantism again . Ideas go back to basics . Food and shelter and clothing , medicine and transportationand the rest of it . Everybody has the same needs , but ninety per cent of the world 's wealth is in the hands of ten per cent of the world 's people . A revolution has to come . "  | " Movements have to come . Marx was right , the world is a machine ; but he thought some parts , the parts he named , moved while the rest held still . I see two major motions in the world now . There is this seeping down and outwards of Euro-American consumerism . And there is this groping upwardsof the dusky underdog . But a third motion encompasses both . As the poor man reaches upwards , the ground is sinking beneath his feet , he is sinking in the spreading poverty , the muchness of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , overpopulated world . " He sipped his beer ; its bubbles reminded him : " In my boyhood the giraffes , the elephants , the lions were familiar deities , come to play on the horizon of our world . Soon there will be no animals left bigger than men . Then , only cockroaches , rats , and men . So these gestures of economics are like the reaching gestures on Gericault'spainting of the raft of the Medusa , gestures that will never grasp their objects , because the raft is sinking . Your Communism is such a failed gesture . In the industrialized countries of Western Europe , where Marx reasoned the uprisingmust come , the Communist party officials wear suits with vests , and sidle forward for their share , as you Americans say , of the pie . " Her silence , during which she appeared to be focusing closely upon his lips , emboldened him to continue , in what he fancied a Dostoevskian vein : " The age of any revolution is five years . After that , either its participants have wandered off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become an establishment , generally more tyrannous than the one they displaced . We Africans like de Gaulle . He reminds us of the giraffe , of the gods that no longer visit us . He will make a revolution , not from underneath but from above ; give him five years . Algeria will get its independence , and with it , because the French are imperious and demand absolute logic ofp176themselves , all the vast lesser bits of French West Africa , even my empty , unloved Noire . That is how history happens , in fits of impatience . Then de Gaulle will be thrown aside , like Robespierre ; or else become a fussy old man losing quarrels with his Parliament . No matter ; by then I will have returned . Au revoir , Etats-Unis ! Farewell , Esmeralda ! " The future Ellellou had a strange sensation , sometimes , in talking to these Americans , black or white : their faces were units in a foreign language , they inhabited a stratum of reality , a slant of thought , so remote from his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Esmeralda 's solemn gray face , with that touch of languid sexuality working at the rounded points of her jaws , seemed across the table a chasm or a well he was looking straight down into , where his own head was distantly , waveringly mirrored . She said , " You should write some of that up and send it to The Journal of Underdeveloped Political Thought . " The journal was really called Political Thought in the UnderdevelopedNations , and was published by a group of suspect liberals and malcontented expatriates in an adjacent Midwestern state , one also shaped like a mitten . Hakim took her advice , spinning out in a few long caffeine-crazed nights between terms that little string of articles mentioned sixteen years later , with unintended provocative effect , by the unfortunateGibbs . They comprised in Hakim 's mind the third triumph of his undergraduate career . The second had been his near-election , missing by four votes ( his four black friends , he suspected ) , as Campus Organizer of Pep . His first had been his seduction of Candy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Esmeralda asked . He toyed with his empty beer glass , wondering if he should have another . " I had not thought so . "  | " Good luck , black boy , losing her . These white chicks like to call the tune ; leave off the loving , they holler rape . " " My native land would seem a barren place to Candace . " The balusters of her staircase , the claustrophobic comfort of her father 's living-room , swirled through his mind , as he exposedhis lower teeth in reflection , conscious of Esmeralda 's abnormally intent focus upon his lips . Her stare was numbing his gums . " Somebody that strong-headed and spoiled thinks she could melt the North Pole if she went there . That 's the weakness of a ruling class , they ca n't take in adverse information . How do you feel about Craven ? " He flipped the little cardboard coaster , idly , to the side without an advertisement . " Unhappy . I believe there have been tender passages between them . " " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything as long as it 's not a boy her own age , race , and income bracket . That 's her revolution . Haps , she 's bad news . She 's tough , and she 's cold . What is the magic ? You 've been making yourself conspicuouswith that girl since you set foot on free soil . " He thought of Candy , her pink cheeks , her red knitted headscarf , her neurotic sharp smile , and of how , coming up to her along a diagonal path , standing next to her in the cold , he felt airy and towering . He told Esmeralda , " It 's like eating snow . " Even this seemed too much a confession , a betrayal ; he became angry with his interrogator . " Why should I come to this country to sleep with a black woman ? " he asked her explosively . " My country is nothing but black women . " Still in that squeezed voice of anger , he said , " How about another beer ? " " Beer back at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Young Communist Club kept two rooms in an asbestosshingledtenement house on a back street of Franchise , for ap178rent that , though beyond the means of the meagre membership , was somehow met . Esmeralda could count , this night as on most nights , on having the place to herself . They walked along pavements packed with snow , only the heads of the parking meters protruding from the drifts , the whiteness hardened to ice and tinted by neon signs and the half-lit display windowsof closed shops , ungrated in those safe days , even the windows of jewelry stores . Back from Commerce Street the pavements were erratically shovelled , so for some stretches , where a widow lived , or a family that had fallen below the social norms , glossy mounds had to be traversed on little paths , worn by the boots of schoolchildren . Candy for this weekend had gone away with her family , skiing in the Laurentians . The YCC quarters were identified only by the initials . No hammer and sickle , no red star . There had been problems with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mattress on the floor did for a bed . The term " crash pad " had not yet been invented . Esmeralda 's body , naked on the sheetless ticking , was the same slate hue her face was , an even soft gray that moved him , taken with her stringy hips and underdeveloped breasts ; the slaver 's sperm , it seemed , had entered her blood line to steal shine from her skin , and joyful African protuberancefrom her body . When she left the bed , instead of glimmeringin the darkened room like a candle , she vanished . What Felix liked best about these American seductions was not the exchange of salivas and juices but the post-coitus , the ritual cigarettes and the standing around in the kitchen rummagingup something to eat , their exploited genitals lit up by the sudden glow of the refrigerator , its polychrome wealth of beer cans , yogurt cups , frozen vegetables , packets of cheese and luncheon meats and other good bottled , wrapped , and encapsulatedthings . The young Communists , like any frat , kept a sweet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reared on nutsp179and porridges , this gentle , naked pecking after food  --  Esmeraldaconcocted herself a sandwich of peanut butter and marshmallow fluff  --  savored of home and soothed the acerb aftereffects of the tragic act of love . She had had no climax , and he had been distracted by the giant red poster of Lenin , goateed and pince-nezed , staring upwards with the prophetic fury of a scholar who has just found his name misspelled in a footnote . " She ai n't even taught you how to screw , " Esmeraldasaid , pleased to have an additional score on Candy , and depressing her lover with the hint that their fornication , in such romantic surroundings , had been merely an extension of a propaganda campaign . To an extent , it worked ; he looked more kindly upon Marx thereafter , as Marx , from a poster on the other wall , grandfatherly and unfoolable , had looked kindly down upon the heaving buttocks of the future Ellelloii . The time had come for them to leave the caravan . The flinty passes had widened and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , weeks to the northeast , the southwest corner of Egypt . We thanked Sidi Mukhtar with a purse of hundred-lu pieces . Feeling that our relationship , though extended in time , had been less close emotionally than it might have been , I confided that I and my beautiful bride ( as amorous , I further confided in coarse Berber , as she was shapely ) had peeked into some of the caravan 's cases and discovered their unexpected contents . His grin displayingthe rift between his front teeth , and lifting a pearlsizedwart nestled in the flange of one nostril , our leader explained the eventual destination of the office supplies : Iran . " The Shahanshah , " he said , " has much wish to modernize . In his hurry he buy typewriters from West Germans and paper from Swedes and then discover only one type spool fit type/writer , only one type eraser not smudge paper . American know-how meanwhile achieve obsolescence such that only fitting spool stockpiled in Accra as aid-in-goods when cocoa market collapse . Formula of typewriter eraser held secret and cunning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ price to finance purchase of jet fighters , computer software , and moon rocks . French however operating through puppet corporations in Dahomey have secured formula as part of multi-billion-franc deferred-interest somatic-collateral package and erect eraser factory near gum arabic plantations . Much borax also in deal , smuggled by way of Quagadougou . Now Sadat has agreed to let goods across Nile if Shahanshah agrees to make anti-Israeli statement and buy ten thousand tickets to son-et-lumiere show at Sphinx . " I did not believe the rogue 's garbled story , but deemed it prudent to suppress my doubts . Instead , I repeated our appreciation of his rejela ( valor ) and dhiyafa ( hospitality ) , said that his skill at navigating through the perils of the Balak argued a pious intimacy with the purposes of Allah , and , by way of parting compliment , confided , " Unbeknownst to you , you have been transporting , in the guise of two mendicant musicians , the President of Kush and one of his First Ladies . Je suis Ellellou . " " Je sais , je sais , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his face in merriment twitching like the skin of a sand lizard just emerged from his hole . " Otherwise , I kill . We see Benzi following us before mountains become too bad . Super car , gives ride free of sway . " " Why would you have killed me ? " It is perhaps part of my inheritance from the communally tender , multi-generational , intra-supportive village of my upbringing to be always astonishedthat any real harm lurks in the world . The third component of Sidi Mukhtar 's personality , hisp181sirge ( thievishness ) , shuffled cheerfully to the fore . He answeredme , " To sell Madame to the Yemenis . Good posh black girls , with correct long neck and hollow back , very hard to come by . Only shoddy slaves come on market now . Mostly drug addicts from bourgeois European families , decadent riffrafflooking for security . Yemenis , Saudis need intelligent slaves , to operate electrical appliances . " Here , too , I doubted the mercantile tall tale , and distrusted the note of socialist snobbery he had injected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ camels with sacks of dried dates and sloshing skins of water . We exchanged farewells : my " Allah Maak " for his " Aghrub Anni . " The caravan , our home for these moons , shuffled , clanked , and sighed its way out of sight , as the tepid dawn washed away the shadows of the night and , with them , the stars . An hour later , we discovered that the villain had given us not water in our zemzimayas but wine , which our religion forbade us to drink , though from its bouquet it was a fair vintage ; a lot of sturdy Bordeaux found its way into our trade routes , brought back to Dakar in the peanut-oil tankers as ballast . Glimpses of rock doves led us upwards and leftwards , into a porous region of caves . At this height color crept back , first by way of iridescent hints in the birds ' feathers , next in the rainbow-shimmer on the oil-smooth face of an overhanging rock . We passed through pastel moments much as Esmeralda and I had paced a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of pale Candace . Sheba rode a camel of the coveted azrern shade  --  a pinkish eggshell , dun toward the tail and white in the huge eyelashes that fringed the iris of glacial blue . My own steed was a mud-brown gelding with a worrisomely depressedhump and a nagging habit of clearing his throat . The pads of their feet , evolved for the erg 's slipping sands , split on the rocky trails , and as the days wore on we often dis/mounted and walked beside them , winding our way upwards , led by the bubbling coo of coral-footed doves . The geology was strange . Certain summits appeared to have been molded by a giant , ill-tempered child , finger-furrows distinct and some petrified depressions holding the whirling ridges of what seemed a thumbprint . The terrain felt formed by play , of an idiotic sort that left no clues to the logic of the game . A frozen bulbousness  --  double-dip , Reddi-Whip accumulationsof weathered lava topped by such gravitational anomaliesas natural arches and big boulders balanced on smaller  --  gave way to cleavages and scree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shop . Amid these splits and frolicsome tumblings , caves abounded ; where the caves multiplied , so did the paintings left by the mysterious happy herdsmen and hunters of the Green Sahara . Centuries of calm sunlight had not faded their sheltered ochres and indigos . Wild buffalo bore between their horns little round marks like shrunken halos ; their hunters were depicted with skins the color of oranges and enlarged heads round as the helmets of space travellers . In a deep cave a galloping goddess , daintily horned , a shower of grain between her antennae like static , rose to the domed ceiling , carrying up with her the steatopygialsilhouettes of naked mortals , running also , overlaid and scattered like leaves in agitation slipping from a tree . Brown , gray , custard , pepper , cinnamon : the colors of our African cookery depicted , with the primitive painter 's numinous , nervous precision , the varieties of cattle , as the herding culture replaced the hunting . These very herds , no doubt , had helped turn the grassland from green to tan , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a ballerina , her sumptuous costume in tatters from which color had forever fled , her intricate necklacesof lapis lazuli and jasper and of coral from a shore where milk-warm waves lapped life into quivery barnacles fallen bitp183by bit along our way , wanted to stay in a cool dim cave , and die . We had drunk the sardonic wine on the second day , blaspheming against our bodies , and had vomited accordingly . The dried fruit stuck in our throats like ash ; her dear tongue was swollen like the body of a frog in the dried mud of an exhausted water hole ; she spoke indistinctly , but I understood her to say that she was dizzy , and that her skull had a sun of pain in it . Begging her to rise and stumble another kilometer forward with me , stooping down and with my own depleted strength tugging at her resistless limbs , I thought of all the women I had led into such a wilderness , a promised green land of love that then had turned infertile , beneath the monomaniacaleye of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to create a nation as a pedestal for myself , my pathetic self . The whites of her eyes , rolling upwards in a delirious faint , had become an astonishing golden color , as in the hollow head with which a mummified Pharaoh is helmeted for his spaceflight , the golden eyes inset with onyx irises that have been stolen . " Do it to me , baby , do it , do it , " I crooned , to tease her back to life , to bring her back from mummification into the moist full skin of the girl I had met strolling the alleys of Istiqlal , her svelte jaws methodically chewing uppers and downers , kola and khat , her ear pressed to a transistor radio tuned to the perfidious pop-rock stations of Brazzaville , the same Plus Haute Quarantaine over and over . I had been in the disguise of a gum-seller , little packets of Chiclets that sold two for a lu , or for a kiss in lieu of that . At the first touch of her lips I knew Sheba had the mouth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even more generously stuffed than the lower , were split , the skin at the edges of the split blackenedas if deliberately singed , and the pale inner lining , next to her gums , blued by the onset of cyanosis.  | " My . . . Lord , " she pronounced . " Divorce . . . me . " " Never , " I said , and managed to work her limp body onto my shoulders . I carried her from the cave to the camels , who were waiting with that impeccable poise of their species , conservingtheir inner resources . But as I dropped her diminished weight across the embroidered saddle cloth of her beautiful azrem mount , the creature died . It did not even keel over , but held in death its sitting position ; the head on its long neck simply rested on the rocky trail , and twisted gently as the muscles relaxed . Its albino lashes lowered like drawgates . Was this the end ? Never , I repeated to myself . All of the nubile women in our land of Kush @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with which to stab their own hearts if their honor is compromised , ere the rapist can work his will . My mother , alas , had had no such implement , but Sheba did . I plucked it , its blade of Damascus steel and handle of polished chalcedony , from the bindings of her bosom and cut open the dead camel 's stomach , so we could drink the brackish green water secreted there . With this liquid I called Sheba back to life ; she shuddered and wept , and as her strength returned cursed me in the astonishingly vile language which flows so easily from the lips of even the prettiest of the younger generation . As she gave out these signs of restored vitality , I loaded our baggage onto our surviving camel , my mudcoloredmount , with his housemaid 's knees and smoker 's hack . He accepted Sheba 's weight  --  Takbir !  --  and I shuffled beside them on foot . Vistas loomed , through clefts and apertures worn by wind erosion , of a hazed sea of sand so far below us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Ippi Rift Valley that runs north and south through the center of my great land . Closer to our eyes , petrophagous lichen silvered the relative damp of some shadows , and an inverted dwarfp185species of thornbush ( Alhagi inversum ) adorned the underside of ledges . The quality of the rock-paintings , too , was subtly changing ; daubed ground ochre and charcoal paste gave way to a furry , swirling technique of primary colors sprayed from a can . Swastikas , stylized genitals , and curious forms involving circles attached to crosses or arrows or circumscribing a kind of airplane replaced the magical representations of Green Sahara 's vanished animists . Some of the hieroglyphs could be read : ROCKETS , CLASS OF ' 55 , GAY IS GOOD , REVOLUCION AHORA , QUEBEC LIBRE , HELTER SKELTER , FAT CITY . The letters of this last were themselves fat ; this style was prevalent . Many of the inscriptions had been overlaid : the simple sign STOP had been amended to STOP WAR and then an antipacifisthad scratched out the S. Some inviting surfaces were muddy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even if Sheba and I had had the stomach for it , which we did not . For our drink of camel bile had turned our bowels queasy . She had become the gray of the cardboard that stiffens a fresh ream of paper . I too , at this oxygen-scant altitude , under the vertical gaze of noon , on this leaden planet , could go on no farther . We half-toppled , half-crawled into the scribbled mouth of a cave , that seemed to be the entrance , a kind of kiosk , to a subterranean system in whose depths , unless my senses of smell and hearing betrayed me , cold flowers were being sold and pinball was being played . The camel accompanied us inside , and was the first to fall asleep . Then Sheba succumbed to oblivion , her head , that little snug sack of loyalty , resting on my arm . The green demon of nausea churning within kept me from sleeping instantly ; as my eyes adjusted to the gloom I saw that our shelter and , it seemed likely , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still was love 's memorial . TEx LOVES RITA , a wall opposite proclaimed , and from this same wall , and those adjacent , thep186names of many more thronged like clouds of the damned to my attention , not all of them written in the flatfooted alphabet Roman imperialism marched through Europe , but many in our own incomparably dancing Arabic script , and some in the chunky formations of St. Cyril , the flowerets of lower-case Greek , Asia 's busy bamboolike brushstrokes , and the staring , rectilinear symbols of Tiffinagh , that traces Tamachek onto the sand . So many names , so much love , so many cries uttered on the verge of la petite ' Tiorte , so much sperm ; my stomach sickened , and the blood ebbed from my head . But before I lapsed , in tune with Sheba 's breathing , into the sleep that might be our last , I noticed , on a rock above her head thisindelible legend : HAPPY LOVES CANDY . " What did your father say ? " " It 's not as if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He used to ask a lot of questions , he was very interested in you . He thought you could tell him the secret , of how the blacks can be the way they are , of why they do n't love this country the way he does . " " His and theirs are n't the same country . They 're as differentas Heaven and Hell . " " I know that , Happy , do n't argue with me . I 'm just trying to be him for a minute . My goodness , you 're touchy these days . " " Pre-partum blues , " he suggested , in his lover 's weary voice . The snow had melted , refroze , and finally receded for the last of the four times he would witness this beautiful North American relenting ; their graduation approached . " And carping , " Candy continued , unmollified . " At times you sound exactly like Esmeralda . Fucked her lately ? " He said nothing . He realized that to assure her that he hadp187not slept with Esmeralda after the occasion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women have for infractionsof their property rights , sniffed out and goaded him to confess , would be to repaint in newly vivid colors this baleful lapse , and to renew Candy 's hyperbolic anger and grief . Her overreaction had baffled and then frightened him . He had tapped , all innocently , a source of passion , of human power , unknown to Africa . In the village , the bushes had every night quivered with casual pairings . He had taken Kadongolimi 's many previous lovers into his arms along with her tattoos . The episode with Esmeralda had been painless , instructive , more healthful than another beer , and on the whole less intimate , in terms of penetration of his nervous system , than would have been a trip to her father the dentist . Really , Candy had punishedhim too severely for this walk through the snow ; her copious tears over the event had dried to an unending sarcasm , a baring of fangs in her voice . These toubabs were indeed poison ; he had less trouble believing , as W. D. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engendered , had to be banished , a race of snarling , howling wolves , to the icy caves of Europe . Candy would get a wolvish look at the thought of his infidelity . Her lips would go parched ; her eyes would turn lifeless , cold , and small . She would begin to talk about the sacrifices she had made for him . Her whole life had been ruined , it seemed , by the injection of his sperm . Yet , paradoxically , not a drop of that sperm must be spilled out of her body . She had rights . She had put herself in great social peril . She , she . She told him , " I ca n't trust you at all anymore . You two can sneak off into the bushes any time . You have such wonderful things in common . You both hate whites . You both have rhythm . I bet you talk about me , do n't you ? You call me pinktoes. "  | " Please , " he said , embarrassed for her . She did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Do n't you find her bony ? " she asked . " And pedantic ? And  --  well , dreary ? So just barely middle-class ? Think of her father , drillingall those teeth . " " As opposed to glorious yours , selling all those policies . " " Sneer at Daddy if you must , he 'd do anything in the world for Mother and me . He 'd kill for us , if he had to . " " Or just for the pleasure of killing . " Tears turned her eyelids pink . She set her arms stickily around his neck , proud of those tears , of her hot close breath . " Happy , this is n't us . What 's gone wrong ? " You have gone wrong . You must let go . He suppressed these words , patiently asking once more , " What did your father say , exactly ? " " He was horrible , " she sobbed . " Just horrible . " Holding her , he was reminded of how , in an intermission of soldiering , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had held one of Kadongolimi 's babies , that had been born while he was a year away , against his chest , and patted it to ease its colic , its innerdemons , and this infant wished upon him had burped air ; the women gathered around like a single-bodied black continuum had praised this little hiccup . So Candy now wanted to be praised for her sobs . " He said , " she forced out , " he 'd kill you if you tried to marry me . " " Marry you ? And what did you say to that , darling ? " " I said "  --  a shudder , a big gulp , a sob , and then  --  " he could n't stop us , we 'd elope . " In his sleep with Sheba , Ellellou rotated , his robes entangled beneath him and enfolding lumpy pockets of the white dust of the cave floor . He was aware through his dreams of thesep189lumps and of her body , sunk in forgetfulness but now any then roused to rotate like his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rustle , their hunger and thirs borne by shrivelled organs submerged beneath the reach o pain . Yet no submergence quite concealed from that mass o sporadic lights , colors , and linkages that was his immortal con sciousness the fact of this proximate woman , her scent an , sadness and the warm skin beneath her own robes , that hal come through the Balak faded as by too scalding a wash . Hi sleeping brain acknowledged the certain graciousness of he accompanying him , though from the Marxist standpoint i could be maintained that she had no choice , it was accompan : him or wander the streets as a waif of poverty . But what wa this , this trek through silicon and starlight and now this deaf : in a cavern strewn with condoms and Kleenexes and othe sedimented evidences of love , but poverty ? In Ellellou 's slee an arch of pity and sorrowful gratitude built itself from hi beating heart to this his rib , his mate , enclosing as in a cryr Sheba 's body , her yielding lips , her blue-black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then a scent of vodka was at hi nostrils , and water was at his lips . " Prosnis ' , c-hernozhopyi ! " a Targui was shouting in m ear ; and my first waking thought was that of course it mus have been the Russians who stole the head of the king , fo only they would have been so anthropologically obtuse withi their own passionate , isolate culture and prodigious territoric as not to know that the Tuareg were the traditional enemic of Wanjiji , holding the riverine kingdom in thrall when the ; were strong , retreating back into the desert when they wer weaker . The Tuareg could not help but regard us as slave : and we them as devils , devils from the desert , howling like th harmattan , their mouths masked because they had no jaw just gaping throats that spewed vile yells and cruelty . Thesp190Tuareg succoring me had their mouths and noses swaddled ; nothing showed but their wolvish pale eyes , and their muffled voices . " Eta chernaya pizda nichevo zhivchik , a ? " " Spokoino , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if I had no ears . One of them wore steelrimmedspectacles ; when his comrades noticed I was awake , he began to address me in his slurred Iraqi Arabic and , his vocabularyfailing , his sloshy French . " Rise up , Mr. President ! " he cried through the haze of languages . " You are near the end of your journey ! The path has been made easier ! Vive Kush ! Vive le peuple et la fraternite socialiste et islarnique ! Ecrase l'infdme capitaliste , monopolise , et tres , tres decadent ! " Several Tuareg women , their naked faces impassive , the wrists and ankles dyed blue , were laving Sheba 's feet and rebraidingher hair ; though my dear girl flickered toward me a feeble smile , her eyes , under a helpless pressure , kept closing , the lids freshly anointed with antimony . It was true , the upward path had been made easier . The steepness declined , as the summit neared , and an asphalt strip , wide enough for a golf cart , with green-painted pipe railings on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where the natural trail might have seemed impassably rugged . Yellow signs advised FALLING ROCK and ORYX CROSSING , and others advertised our growing closeness to the ORACLE 'S CAVE , to LA TETE QUI PARLE , tO MaB3oJIeii 3j yMy geTBepTOro . My old brown baggage camel , who had been fed a barrel of Ukrainian millet ( or could it have been Nebraska sorghum ? ) , fairly danced on his threadbare legs as he bouncinglybore along the sumptuous little body of Sheba , who had been slipped a few kola nuts and was chewing through a high . I felt , as one does after too deep a sleep , uncaught-up with myself : the physical half hurried along to expectancy 's accel/erated heartbeat , while the spiritual man loitered behind in a fog , groping for the reason for his shadowy , guilty sensation of something undone , of something disastrous due . The path , briskly engineered through the rose-colored cliffs and abysses , was crossed by a newly built funicular railway ; the crossingmarking , X , reminded me of something unpleasant I have always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oscar X firmly , patiently stated , as if reciting a memorized speech . " You are what the Messenger terms a black man with a white man 's head . Man , you are sad . You are evil and you are sad . I wash my hands of you . I wish to wipe you from my mind . And la drifuka . The Nationof Islam is one thousand per cent opposed to what you are undertaking . The mixture of the races is a crime against purity . The Word of God unambiguously proclaims , sooner a black man mate with a lazy shit-smeared sow or the female of the alligator species than entrust his ebony penis to the snatch of a white devil mare . " Felix imagined in the floridity of this indictment a simultaneousundercutting , a self-mocking . But he detected no humor or mercy in Oscar 's face . People when they go behind the curtain of a creed become unknown . He said , " You know Candy . You like her . " " I have tolerated her , " Oscar said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the offspring of the stock that has enslaved us , that spits on us whenever it chooses . This woman has spit upon you , and you do n't have the mother wit to wipe your fucking face . " He sipped his Ovaltine and came up with a scummy lip . Barry Little tried to help , telling Felix , " She was raised too clean . She needs to get down into it , but does n't want to get real dirt on herself . So she tells herself a story in the dark . Inp192her mind , you are the pimp and the customers both . That 's a way these upper-class sheltered girls get their kicks , it 's nothing personal in regards to you . Make it personal and permanent , that would be a big mistake . I 'm not saying white and black ca n't live together , they got to , this separate black nation old Elijah Poole keeps plugging is fantastical purely . But in this particular case , of you and little Miss Cunningham , I 'm saying that would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know America , and she do n't know Africa . " " Perhaps we know each other . " " You know each other in the dark , " Barry said . " Out in the light , what do you see ? Her momma 's a washrag and her daddy 's a redneck who 'd fry your ass if he could find the button . Kiss her good-bye , you 'd be doing her a favor as well as yourself . I 'm not talking black or brown , I 'm trying to talk to you straight . If you and she were both green in color , I 'd have my doubts about the personalities . " " No such thing as color blind , " Turnip Schwarz interposed . " No such thing . " Esmeralda said indignantly , " You 're all talking to this boy as though he had a choice . Any choice he ever had he threw away . He 's been hustled . He 's in over his head and ca n't say No now . " " Just get on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Turnip said . Felix felt hemmed in , shoved , in the businesslike American manner . He resented their attempt to pry him open and meddle in the fate he was nurturing within ; he could not explain to them how delicately all the truths they advanced were built into his plan , were included in the sprawling , devious budget that in the end would balance . It was true , Candy had come upon him and was sweeping him along ; but we can propel ourselves only a little way out of ourselves andp193for the rest must play with the forces beyond us that impinge He gazed steadily at Oscar and said , " I have been readin the Book of Books , as the Messenger advises . Women at your fields : go , then , into your fields as you please . " Oscar blinked , and quoted back : " You shall not wed paga women , unless they embrace the faith . A believing slave-gi is better than an idolatress , although she may please you . " " Jesus preserve us , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the luncheonette ; even at a distance , throug the smoke and jangle , the future Ellellou could see she ha been crying . More trouble with her parents , or Craven , some other white spokesmen . She came toward their blac table timidly now , sensing that here too she was abhorre ( Yet in honor of spring she had put on a forsythia-yello , sweater and a pleated white skirt . Felix lifted from his cha as a tide toward the moon . Oscar X stood up angrily . " I will not contaminate myse any longer , " he stated so all could hear , " by consorting wit mongrel clowns and lackeys of the doomed devil-race . " T Felix he said , again with the precision of something rehearse ) " Lanatu Alldhi alayka . " He walked out , taking with hi Temple Two and Temple Three , the joyful car rides togethe the Brotherhood . His curse Felix felt as a blast of heat upc his face , the heat whose first wave had been , in infancy , tl absence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Allah is tl essential seriousness of things , their irreversibility . Our frien ( all die to us , some before we are born . Let us step back a moment , onto the spongy turf of psych historical speculation . There was in our young hero ( not young as he appeared to his clamorous advisers ; by 1958 I was going on twenty-six ) an adsorptive chemical will th made him adhere to just those surfaces that would ha , repelled him : he took away from the United States not onp194the frightened body of Candy Cunningham in a blue linen suit but the Nation of Islam , internalized as a certain shade of beige idealism mixed of severity , xenophobia , decency , and isolation . As New World immigrants preserve in their ethnic neighborhoods folk dances and items of cuisine that in the old country have become obsolete , so Ellellou held to a desiccated , stylized version of the faith that meanwhile failed for Oscar X , who fell away in the mid-Sixties , when the scandals of the Messenger 's sexual strayings ( not one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ climax in the gunning-down of his schismatic Chief Minister Malcolm in New York City , on West 166th Street . So the Nation of Islam was just another gangland after all . In the strength of his disillusion Oscar became a trainee with the Chicago police , and with unfeigned enthusiasm helped bop long-haired protesterheads at the 1968 Democratic Convention , at the same time as his repudiated brother was fomenting the revolution that overthrew Edumu IV and brought Islamic socialism to Noire , renamed Kush . Now the path was continuously paved , and littered with bits of paper  --  torn tickets and Popsicle wrappers . The pigeons were thick about us , throbbling and strutting in their **25;5132;TOOLONG , too full of crushed Fritos and dropped popcorn to flutter away . The first people we saw were Chinese  --  a small close flock of official visitors , in their bluegraymany-pocketed pajamas , their mass-produced wire-frame spectacles ( no doubt of identical prescription ) resting on the fat of their cheeks as they smilingly squinted up from their guidebooks toward something on high we could not yet see . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if the dusty spectacle of the disguised President and his delectable , stonedp195consort on foot and camelback respectively had been organizedfor them as an additional local wonder , they obligingly switched , in a unified motion , their twinkling attention full upon us . These tourists appeared amazed when the weary camel plodded straight toward them , rippling his upper lip contemptuously , forcing them to break formation and crowd to the sides of the path . They joked among themselves in their curious pitch-chirping . How had these Confucians come here ? The question was answered by the next turn in the path , which revealed a parking lot blasted from the outcroppings and holding six or seven large tourist buses , some striped like zebras and others spotted like giraffes . Emblazoned on their sides was the name of a Zanj tourist agency , the same which in other directions exposed to the stupefied gaze of aliens , through smoky-blue windows that bathed our Africa in perpetual twilight , the oceanic herds of the Tanzanian grasslands , Lalibela 's cathedrals carved from solid rock , the inexhaustible salt quarries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were exploitable in this continent whose most majestic feature is the relative absence of Man . To such buses the Zanj border was not far away , and evidently the entrepreneurs found no insurmountable obstacle there . I must create one . " I will close the border , " I confided to Sheba . " This is an atrocity . " " I think it 's an improvement , " she said languidly , from within her trip . " Can I have another lemonade ? " We had patronized a refreshment stand manned by a detribalizedDjerma , offering beverages in all bubbling colors . " The delicate ecology of the Balak , " I told her , " is being devastated . " " There 's lots left , " she pointed out . " One germ can kill a giant , " I explained to her , vowing , " I 'll have old Komomo 's hide for this . " Wamphumel Komono , President-for-Life of Zanj : heightp196six foot six , weight three hundred seventy pounds . He wore ( and still wears , but for my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the past tense ) garish robes so intricately worked each sleeve cost a seamstress her sight and a crown that consisted of a cheetah 's snarling skull , gilded . Worse , he was a flirt . The British had taught him this . They had flirted with him by capturing him when he was a guerrilla leader , placing him in prison , scheduling his execution , and then , when the rising tides of freedom forced them to decamp , suddenly installing him as President , in return for his promise not to expel the white settler community from the fertile highlands and along the little seacoast . The shape of Zan ) reached out to include its miserable Red Sea port like a child touching wet paint while looking the other way . The bulk of Zanj was as infertile , unprofitable , and stately as ' Kush . But old Komomo , with his picturesque regalia of catskins , ornamentalwelts , and medals from the lesser European armies , tirelessly flirted with the international community , inviting the Americans in to build him a desalination plant and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his air force and then expelling them , milking even the Australians and the post-Sukarno Indonesians for their dollop of aid , their stretch of highway , their phosphate refinery , or mile-high broadcastingantenna . Now his pets were the Chinese , who were building him a railway from his nasty little port to the preposterous new capital he had ordained in the interior , Komomo-glorifying Zanjomo , its street-plan cribbed from Baron Haussmann , its government buildings based on photos of forgotten World Fairs , its central adornment a mockheroicbronze stalagmite bearing Komomo 's shifty features in imitation of Rodin 's Balzac and likely to survive the model 's death for one week , by which time the old nepotist 's competingsons-in-law will have melted it down for bullets . Not ap197tuck in his patriarchal robes ungarnished by private gain , which he extracted from the toubab corporations as blithely as his forebears the cannibal chiefs extracted bongo from the Arab slavers , Komomo flirted moreover with all the elements within his country , appearing in ostrich feathers in a veldt village and a hardhat in a magnesium mine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ placating the Asian community with public readings from the Upanishads , balancing his denunciations of Ian Smith and the stillexclusivistZanj Athletic Club with frequent photographs of himself embracing some visiting devil or local " landowner " and " business leader , " touting with scrupulously equal decibels the " tribal integrity " of " our great African masses " and the " total impartiality " of " our color-blind Constitution . " The American press loved this artful clown ; in their rotogravures he looked like a negative print of Santa Claus . Now he was flooding my purified , penniless but proud country with animalisticbuses stuffed full of third-echelon Chou Shmoes , German shutterbugs , British spinsters , bargain-seeking Bulgarians , curious Danes , Italian archaeologists , and trip-crazed American collegians bribed by their soused and adulterous parents to get out of the house and let capitalism collapse in peace  --  all to see a dead head in the dead center of the Bad Quarter . At the next turn of the path , as the bridle burned in my hands , so hard was it being tugged by my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could see a polychrome , polyglot little mob gathered at the mouth of what must be the cave . It looked artificial , but badly made , like a department-storewindow display , besprinkled with greenish glitterdust . It is said that God , as he created these mountains of the Balak , worked in haste . It is also said that the royalty of Kush , chased from Meroe by the Christian hoards of Axum , mayp198have come this way , constructing as they went cities scarcely distinguishable from the rocks . Or perhaps  --  a third possibility  --  the unsubtle Soviets , having selected this as the site from which to broadcast slander against the incorruptible President of Kush , had with their usual heavy hand engineered the locale to resemble one of those concrete medleys of domes and parapets that speak to their huddling hearts . One of Dr. Frederic ( without the k , yes ) Craven 's courses in the Government Department of McCarthy College was " U.S. vs . USSR : Two Wayward Children of the Enlightenment . " Another course was " Plato to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " There was a sardonic touch , too , to his seminars : " Bureaucratic Continuity During Political Crises " studied , with use of original documents , phenomena such as the adjudication of misdemeanors and traffic fines during the French Revolution and mail delivery during the American War Between the States . " Weak or Strong ? : The Presidency from Fillmore to the Second Harrison " took the paradoxical position that American history would have been much the same if the opponents of these Chief Executives had been elected instead , and that the average man fared better under Pierce and Grant than under Lincoln . He also taught the only course that touched upon the darkest continent : " The Persistence of the Pharaonic Ideal in the Sudanic Kingdomsfrom 600 to i600 A.D. " Felix and Candace took this course together ; their shoulder-rubbing proximity during lectures gave the lecturer pain . Candy was one of Craven 's " pets . " In that sinister way of American intellectual men , he had grown handsomer with age , his boyishly gaunt figure filling out without ceasing to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sailing through September onp199the cerulean , polluted surface of Lake Timmebago , he had created in time a kind of vertical harem of undergraduate mistresses , whom graduation disposed of without his even having to provide a dismissive dowry . Candy , apparently , in some interstice or worn spot of her harassed liaison with the future Ellellou , had placed herself among Craven 's concubines , and had renewed the relationship when the young African  --  understandably , to all but her  --  had waffled or responded sluggishly to her female call for a " commitment " that translated into elopement , bigamy , and for all he knew , American arrest and incarceration . One warm day deep in the reign of Dwight Eisenhower , Craven invited the black student to his office , a cozy cave lined with leaning gray government manuals and smelling of the peculiarly sweet pipe smoke it was one of Craven 's vanities to emit . He offered Felix a low seat on his Naugahyde seducer 's couch but the youth , his manner stiff with a wary dignity , took instead a hard straight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loaded with blue exam booklets . End of term was at hand . " Hakim Felix , " the professor began , evidently imagining this mode of address was swankily parallel to use , in Russian , of the patronymic , " let me begin by confessing some slight disappointment in your exam . You had the facts down pat , but , if I may say so , you seemed to show less gut feeling for the African ethos than some of the middle-class white kids in the course . Miss Cunningham , for instance , wrote an essay on kinship that damn near made me cry . " The student perched still farther forward on the overburdenedchair . " Africa is large , " was the best excuse he could offer for his curious failure . " Also , the French did not encourage our ethos , they were intent upon inculcating their own . " " Well , " Craven briskly conceded , sucking lip-smackinglyp200upon his pipestem , releasing a blue wraith of saccharine alterego , " far be it from me to out-African an African . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something missing . " " Perhaps that is the very African ingredient . " Craven closed his pale , rather too mobile lips upon the amber of his pipestem . He did not relish fancy thinking not his own . " I asked you in , though , not to talk about that but to wish you well , really . Can you tell me your plans , Felix ? " " I plan to return , sir . The U.S. immigration officials have never been happy with my status here , though the college has been most liberal and supportive . In Noire , King Edumu , placed back on his throne  --  placed , I should say strictly , on a throne he never before occupied  --  in the wake of Guy Mollet 's loi-cadre proclamation two years ago , has instituted a policy of amnesty toward political criminals under colonialism . And now that de Gaulle has offered the territories either internal autonomy with assistance or complete autonomy without , I think a new era is even more decisively under way , and I will be able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without fear . " " There is no politics without fear , " Craven said , " as there is no organization without coercion . However , I wish you well . Have you no fear , may I ask , of having lost touch , these four years , with the realities of your own people ? " " As your examination suggests I have . I do not know . My guess is , America will fade for me as even the most intense dreams fade , and in any case the realities of my people are not static , but in the process of transformation . Perhaps I can help create new realities . " " Perhaps . " The pipe came into even more elaborate play , the amber stem pointing this way and that as Craven knocked , blew into , and rapidly reamed this little instrument of pleasure.  | " Will America fade , I wonder , so rapidly if you take a piece of it with you ? A living piece . You know to whom I refer . " " I do , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rest easy , I beg you . The new President of Sahel , a poet of sorts , has for wife a mignette from Lyons . The mighty Sulieman , as you well know , made his queen Roxelana , a consort of Russian blood paler than even the lovely strawberry-blond Mrs. Craven , to whom I hope you will forward my parting regards . " " I will , " he said , in unwilled echo of his broken weddingvows . " Surely , " the student meekly persisted , " distinctions in tint of skin have no priority in the world that my professors , you foremost , have taught me must be welded into one , lest the nuclear holocaust transpire . I have come here in innocence , anxious to learn , and part of my American experience has been to fall in love ; how could it have been otherwise ? This is the land where love is broadcast with the free hand of Johnny Appleseed . " " Be that as it may "  --  one of Craven 's favorite phrases , while he searched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instance I have in mind , sentimental exogamist though I am bound to be , I can see , frankly , little good . The female is spoiled , neurotic , headstrong , and too young to know her own mind . You are older , a man of some experience , though I sometimes wonder if your experiences as you describe them do not partake of the fabulous . Why could you not be , for example , an Americanfrom , say , Detroit , who affects a French accent and the prissy African manner ? That would explain why , in your examination , you showed so little feel for the , shall we say , heart of the matter . " " Might it be the instructor who lacks the feel ? Africa is not only log drums and sand dunes ; we have cities , we havep202history , which you proposed to teach . We have languages , more than any other continent . We are a melting pot that will not boil over with the addition of one more female Caucasian .

" " If by my friends you mean Esmeralda and Oscar , they have their own points of view , their own reasons for jealousy and malice . I can not really see why you are bothering to hector a student on the subject of his personal life . If you have a claim to exert over Miss Cunningham , or a proposal to make to her alternative to mine , then do so ; otherwise , let her join in silence the ranks of your lovely one-time students . " " Your welfare concerns me as well as Candy 's . " " Let me ask you this : were I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , would you be so concerned ? Would you , even if you were , presume to call me in , like some shoeshine boy who has applied the wrong color polish ? " " I resent your implication . I have friends of every race ; I was a vocal supporter of the civil rights movement long before it became fashionable . I am a charter member of the Franchise Fair Housing Committee . The fact that you and she are black and white is not the issue . Your education here has been an utter waste if you imagine that it is . " " My education here has been strange , " Felix told Craven , contemplating with loathing the toubab 's dry , prematurely gray hair ; his soft broad lips like two worms bloodless and bloated ; his complacent , ever youthful eyes . This man , thep203African thought , sails on the black waters of the world 's suffering ; the future Ellellou announced , " Your warnings about myself and Candy are not altogether foolish . Nevertheless , I will take her with me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reasons at least . Because she wishes it , and because you do not . She has asked to be rescued , to be lifted from the sickly sweetness of her life in this sickening-rich country and replanted in an environment less damaged . Though you would all , black and white , deny her this , I will grant it . I will grant her freedom , in the style of your heroes , with their powdered hair and rouged faces , the Founding Fathers ; Libertyor Death is the slogan you fling from your ivied fortress , your so-called Department of Government ; I fling it back , demonstrating that your instruction has not been entirely wasted upon me . I thank you , Professor Craven . Good luck in your Cold War , your battle against Sputnik . Good luck in your magnificent campaign of seduction of ignorant virgins , so as to avoid looking into the ravishing eyes of the loyal , sorrowing Mrs. Craven . " Craven 's white face had gone whiter , realizing through the sweetish pipesmoke that he was closeted with a demagogue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a number of better-forgotten run-ins obstructing his departure with Candy from America , realized that Craven ( who had given him , in petty retaliation for this interview , on a postcard that took seven months to arrive in the then Caillieville , a B  --  for the course ) had somewhat resembled the martyred Gibbs . The Kush International Airport , a single runway east of Al-Abid , shimmers like a mirage amid the whistling-thorn . The tires of planes touching down frequently explode fromp204the heat . Zebu , before the drought reduced the herds to hides and bones , were a sometime hazard . Now , the government has erected a two-meter aluminum fence to protect incoming visitors from the squalid , disease-infested emergency camps of refugee pastoralists from the deserted savanna . The glintingfence and the riveted wings of the Air Kush 727 and the great metallic sheet of cloudless sky contracted to pained pinpricks the pupils of the two Americans disembarking and exchanging greetings with the three-person welcoming committee : an oval-faced young Fula wearing a fez ; a shorter plumper older African affecting Italian shoes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wristwatch without a face ; and a fetching if slightly stocky Sara woman accoutered in seersucker and secretarial half-glasses resting on her bosom , hung from a wildebeest-hair cord about her neck . Had the encounter been witnessed by an interested observer ( instead of by the indifferent , wraithlike mechanics in sagging gray coveralls drifting through the haze of hunger , heat , and jet fuel fumes ) he might have deduced that a reunion among longseparatedkin had been effected . In truth , there was a similarity between the effusive welcomers and the greedily welcomed , though the former were solid black and the latter all-American . There were two , a man and a woman . The woman was blond , not in the flaxen way of Candy but brassily , glintingly , with a tinge of tangerine ; her peach-colored suit was too hot for this climate and a rose flush overspread her face in the first minute , before she was completely down the shimmering metal stairs . Shadows below her eyes , emphasized by dents near the bridge of her nose , testified to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suffered grief . This was Angelica Gibbs , whom I had widowed . For all her fatigue , she gave off , in my vision of this encounter where I was absent , that American freshness which never ceased top205delight my eyes on the McCarthy campus , that air of headlong progress , the uptilted chin cleaving gaily through the subarborealshade , a freshness born of fearlessness born in turn of inner certainty of being justly blessed with health and love . She winced but would not wilt in the brightness of Kush  --  a constant lightning , an incessant noon . She shook hands with Ezana , Kutunda , and the ( among his other titles ) Acting Chairman of the Board of Tourism . Her manner was polite , timid , tired , tentative . Not so the manner of the man with her , a short plump man with heavy lids , liquid and lively brown eyes , a hairline mustache waxed to two thornlike points , and graying hair parted as centrally as his mustache . His limbs were short and his center of gravity seemed low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the uproarious embracesof Michaelis Ezana as the two joked like spiritual brothers at last corporally united , Klipspringer ( for it was he ) egging the hilarity on with his farcical Arabic and worse Sara . Kutunda was enchanted into guttural giggles by the apparition , out of the tinny-voiced telephone , of this magical man who had libraries in his pocket and who pretended the world was round as an orange . Mrs. Gibbs , her youthful face prematurelyconsigned to a widow 's watchful sobriety , and the young Acting ( among other responsibilities ) Minister of the Interior , were the most reserved , but were willing , even they , to pin the enthusiasm of hope to this sun-swept intermingling , as the giant turbines of the 727 died , whined to a silence , and the less prestigious passengers  --  shabby Moroccan merchants carrying carpetbags , black chieftains as languidly scornful as rock stars , waxen-faced alcoholic Belgian mercenaries on their furtive way south , Japanese salesmen of telecommunication components , nationless agents of the hydrocarbon cartels , plump disaster bureaucrats from the UN , Jehovah 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mer/cantile and messianic riffraff that has always drifted across the monotonously unanswered question our continent poses  --  poked their heads from the plane , squinted , and tumbled down the stairs . " Welcome to the People 's Republic of Kush , " said Ezana in his Oxonian English accent . " Looks like the country north of Vegas , " Klipspringer told him . " My sinuses feel better already . Washington 's a freezing swamp this time of year . " He spoke with the pith of memos . " God ! " He rapturously inhaled . " Heaven ! " He smoothed back his already smooth hair and beamed toward the aluminum fence , behind which children fought rats for morsels . There was no such thing as garbage in refugee camps . Klipspringer 's black counterpart , as if dancing for his life , which in a way he was , for he had arranged this meeting on sufferance of my interim appointees , made expansive ushering gestures toward the black official Cadillac which had been specially borrowed from the running dogs of Sahel for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old official Citroen had ceased to go up and down on its pneumatic springs and rattled worse than a Dahomey taxi . " In my country , " Ezana told him , " there once were two seasons , dry and rainy . Now there is one . " " Where is the poverty ? " Mrs. Gibbs asked Kutunda . Kutunda looked toward Ezana to decipher the gibberish . " Nowhere , " he prompted her in Sara . Presiding above this friendly confusion was the serene oval face and sleek fez of the Acting Co-ordinator of Forests and Fisheries , who now , having been rehearsed in some ceremonial English , bowed above the short , pink , hopeful , jet-lagged Americans and said with exquisite intonation , " Good-bye . " " Hello , he means , " Ezana interjected . " A greatly giftedp207administrator , a superb student of the Koran , but untrained in your language , which is an exotic one to most of our people . " Hearing the word " Koran , " this Chief of the Bureau of Transport amended his greeting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these satin syllables Angelica Gibbs thrilled . Dear lady , why are you one of this quintet gathered , in the haze of my mind 's eye , to make alliance against Colonel Ellellou , who wanders more kilometers away than there are footprints on the moon , seeking to isolate the germ of the curse on his land ? Can he who follows the guidance of his Lord be compared to him who is led by his appetites and whose foul deeds seem fair to him ? I " zero in " on your face , dear Mrs. Gibbs , you mother of fatherless sons , you trekker through endless supermarket aisles and gargantuan consumer of milk and gasoline . How can you hate me  --  me , a fatherless son ? I am so little . Your face is vast ; powder has silted into the pores ; years have gently webbed your beauty ; disillusion has subtly dimmed the once-blue lakes of your eye-whites , the sensitive black of your pupils ; there is a girlish , anxious tousle to your hair . I want to hide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you distress , at having displaced your farflungarrangements with the world , all the filaments of your careful socio-economic compromise at a blow wiped away . Your great face , conjured from afar by the mystery of your unctuous , scrambling husband 's death , turns a moment , beforeeclipse within the shadows of the Cadillac , toward the miraculously blank Kushite sky ; your face is then blanched by solar fury as well as fatigue , and I , your invisible enemy , see , beneath your lifted upper lip , halfway down one of your splendid American incisors , a tooth bared by a vagary of thought and incandescent in the sun , a speck , no bigger than a bi , no bigger than the dot on a bi , a speck of lipstick , a clot of blood.  |p208As  , both on foot now , amid the lengthening shadows of the hour of sunset prayer , we moved upwards to the domed cave , Sheba surprised me by talking . " My lord , my husband : must this be ? " " My dear Sheba , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may arrive at this point . " " So you say ; but perhaps the travelling , our hardships and our survival of them , was what was necessary for my lord 's purpose : to purify his life and redeem his land . " " If that were so , then rain would be falling . " " Rain in the Balak would be empty noise on stone : perhaps beyond the southern horizon , where the savanna waits to be green again , rain falls . " " When rain falls in Kush , my blood will know it . " " My blood , too , talks . It tells me to be afraid . " " What could my Sheba fear ? Her President is with her , and the Mercedes follows always behind , with Mtesa and Opuku and their machine guns . " " My President , I think , " the girl said , her coiffure restored and her necklace resplendent yet the normal elastic sway of her walk still hobbled , as she made her way with bent , reluctantsteps , " has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life , and such men travel enchanted through the adventures they bring upon others . But I , I have not lived two decades , and am a woman , and my life is of the earth ; though I have given my blood to the earth , it has not yet given me a child , and such peace as I have must come in the chewing of kola nuts and khat , and in the music which lifts one 's soul a little free of sadness . " " I am sorry you are sad . A thousand girls in Istiqlal would exult in the honor of your position . " " The honor has been empty , but I embrace it still . Myp209lord is the touch of Allah to me . Even when my tongue was so swollen I feared I would choke , I adored him . But here , amid these strangers , at the mouth of this artificial wonder , we enteran area of transgression . I wish I were back on the streets of Hurriyah , digging the scene and thinking of nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But I have no choice but to enter it . I am the key that must dare to lose itself in the lock . " " Forgive me , but I do not fear for you , but for myself . That raid by the Tuareg , I was not so dazed I did not wonder if it was not for me they had cone . And then those Tuareg that gave us water , I felt their lust . Our caravan driver said , the Yemenis are starving for slaves . I have value , else my lord would not have stolen me from the streets . " Her shoulders gave a limp doleful shrug as I hugged her . " How foolish and conceited my little queen has become ! Always thinking of herself ! Anyway , the Yemenis keep their slaves now in little air-conditioned ranch houses , with kitchenettes , door chimes , and a rumpus room with a dartboard ! " Yet , though I tried to tease her fear to nothing , her fresh self-expressiveness  --  her attempt to become an independently anxious and defensive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night , my member , adamant as an adolescent 's , penetrated the gently resistant darkness of a woman , troubled and palpablein her fear . My explosion of seed felt engendering , as her hips heaved to receive me deeper , on the oversoft , antisepticmotel bed , and then rolled , instantly , into sleep . For an hour , I caressed Sheba 's shoulders , sheathed shoulder blades , and relaxed buttocks as if tenderly to seal a pledge into her body . Of the events that followed none more enduringly torments me than my never knowing if my instinct was correct , and whether or not a little Ellelloii , wrinkled , innocent , and indignant , nine months later bubbled into this world 's scorching atmosphere out of my fourth wife 's beautifulblue-black loins.  |p210We  had to spend the night because the cave was closed . Indeed we were lucky to find a room in the shabbily constructedtourists ' lodge , with its paper-thin partitions and dubious desk clerk . As we had made the last turn on the golfcartpath through the lengthening lavender shadows , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Northern European schoolgirls poured past us on either side , and beyond them we saw a green steel grate inarguably drawn across the cave-mouth , saying FERMEE , , e , 3axpuT . In smaller type beneath , we read , OUVERT A Hewes 900-1200 , 1400-1730 . Billets d'entree 50 lu . At nine the next morning , therefore , having breakfasted at one of the concessionaire stands that had sprung up like fungi on the spot , vending croissants and caviar , teriyaki and chili , kebab and hot dogs from beneath a chorus of umbrellas , Sheba and I joined the polyglot , vacuouslytitillated crowd waiting for admission . Among its membersI noticed Mtesa and Opuku , standing slightly apart in their uniforms , which appeared fresh . Under cover of the bustle as the green shutter-gate was slowly cranked upwards , and a clammy waft of cold air breathed from the mysteries within , I sidled up to Mtesa and asked , " How did you get the Mercedes up those gorges ? " He stared at me almost impudently ; he was growing a little mustache @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Broad road up from plains . Well-marked , all tourist services . You came the scenic way . " A bell rang , and the crowd pushed forward . Sheba clung to my side in the jostling , sudden darkness . Concrete stairs and ramps alleviated but did not entirely eliminate the treacherous unevenness of the cavern floor . Small spotlights illuminated noteworthy graffiti and , at one spot , a cluster of Silurian mollusc fossils whose sea bed had been gradually lifted into this arid altitude . The oracle was situated in an artfully framed recess ; chains held back the curious from close inspection . La tete du roi , which as we stared slowly gathered to itself ap211greenish glow derived ( I surmised ) from the illuminatory expressionism of the Moscow Arts Theatre , seemed at first one more rough , cracked rocky protuberance among the many others that filled the recess like buds of subaqueous coral , like the polyps the electron microscope reveals in the smoothest matter . Then its details dawned . Edumu 's head , so small in life , had grown larger in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and drooping on one side , perhaps deformed by the force of its severance . I had never chopped off a head before , and one of the disappointments of the Tuareg capture had been my subsequent inability to check my craftsmanship . I had kept my wrists firm and paused at the top . The blow had felt smooth and well-angled , consideringmy state of nervous tension and the muscular inhibitionit induces . A wreath of white cloth , reminiscent of the old king 's lungi , enwrapped the sliced throat , and a kind of altar of Plexiglas demonstrated with its transparence that no body existed beneath the head . The head 's expression was , well , drab . I was reminded of the dusty relics of grandeur in his cell , though the symbolic riband of gold on his forehead took glitter from the rheostatted spotlight . His foolish ecstatic halo of wiry white wool had been tidied and diminished ; undertakersnever get the hair quite right . When Edumu 's eyelids lifted , the crowd gasped and Sheba grasped my hand so hard I felt a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in my wonder at the old king 's shallow-backed eyes . The crazed pallor of the irises was unmistakably his , but these eyes saw . Rather than drifting skywards as they used to in our interviews , they focused out upon us  --  upon me , it seemed  --  levelly . Fighting down the vomitus of superstitious terror rising in my craw , I reasoned that in this detail the enemies of my state had forfeited credibility . The head 's lips moved with the slight stiffness of an enginep212starting in the morning . " Patriotic citizens of Kush , " it creakily addressed the rapt crowd , " there is great evil among you . A greatly evil man , whose name is known to you all , and whose face is known to few . " He and I had chosen my name together , laughing , on an evening in the Palais when he thought the Revolution was a joke , and he would be released from detention when its first wave of bluster was by . " This man , " the head continued , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drifting way Edumu had talked , as if a kind of wind blew in and out of his heart , " pretends to unite the multitudinous races and religionsof Kush against the capitalist toubabs , the fascist Americanswho carry forward the cause of international capitalism on behalf of the world 's rapacious minority of blue-eyed white devils . " Yes , his voice had slightly shifted , in the drafty chambersof my associations , to that of the Messenger , droning on softly in Chicago 's Temple Two , a little brown precipitate of centuries of wrong , a gentle concentration of hate . The head kept talking , with a sudden shrill jump in the amperage of the electrical system that , I realized , was picking up and broadcasting the vibrations of the lungless voice-box . " This man , while proclaiming hatred of the Americans , is in fact American at heart , having been poisoned by four years spent there after deserting the Troupes coloniales . He is profoundlyunclean . One of his wives is American , the wife who is called the All Wrapped Up . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discrimination and confusing emotional experiencesin the land of the devils , and his political war , which causes him to burn gifts of food and assassinate those functionarieswho bring these gifts , is in truth a war within himself , for which the innocent multitudes suffer . He has projectedupon the artificial nation of Kush his own furiousp213though ambivalent will ; the citizens of this poor nation are prisoners of his imagination , and the barren landscape , where children and cattle starve , mirrors his exhausted spirit . He has grown weary of seeming to hate what he loves . Just as nostalgialeaks into his reverie , while he dozes above the drawingboardof the People 's Revolution so vividly blueprinted by our heroic Soviet allies , so traces of decadent , doomed capitalistconsumerism creep into the life-fabric of the noble , beautiful , and intrinsically pure Kushite peasants and workers . " I felt the hand of a hack writer had intruded these phrases into the tape and exclaimed aloud the Berber word for stillfreshcamel dung . My neighbors in the throng shushed me angrily , having been thus far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficulties . " Wrongly , " the head continued , with a new decibel shift , dropping the voice into a more plaintive timbre , " was I , a harmless and cynical figurehead at worst , sacrificed to the welfare of the state . The head that should have rolled belongs to Colonel Hakim Felix Ellellou . Even as his public self puts on a wrathful show of extirpating traces of foreign contamination , his private self , operating upon the innocent vacancy of our sublime but susceptible territory , engenders new outbreaksof the disease . Even now an entire American boom town , with false fronts , brazen bubble-gum-blowing whores , and pombe-dispensing saloons has materialized within the Ippi Rift , above a reservoir of water stored in porous sandstone since the beginning of time against the coming of the Mandi . Destroy this evil city , citizens of Kush !

" I looked about me to see a citizen of Kush , and of course there were none to be seen , only foreigners , adventurers , curiosity-seekers whose minds had already darted ahead to the next sight , the return to the bus , the probability of finding a rest room without a long line . The head was concluding , its lips clearly out of sync , " This has been a vision vouchsafed to me in Paradise , where the veil is lifted from the eyes of men . It comes to you courtesy of Soviet technology . Thank you for your attention .

"  |p215THE  PRESIDENT , all later accounts agree , had endured thediatribe with dignity . Only when the slide show began did he forcefully intervene . Clad , remember , in the tattered galabieh of a desert wanderer  --  an assistant musician , a sideman  --  Ellellou stepped over the chain while the first slides exploded from the projector : Kodachrome fixations of dunes , of peanut pyramids , of the hydroelectric dam beloved of Michaelis Ezana , of feathery tribal dances along the muddy Grionde , of pirogues , of shambas , of a camel ruminating and a muffled Targui glowering before the unexpected background of Istiglal'sEast German skyscraper . Taking abruptly distorted fragments of these images on his back and writhing shoulders , he ripped the head by its fleece from its roots of color-coded wiring cleverly threaded through the top sheet of Plexiglas , which was perforated two-ply . Sparks  --  green , orange  --  flew . Fear and astonishment made a momentary circle of peace around the desecrator.  |p216Edumu  's head shocked Ellellou 's haptic sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watery brains and blood , and its texture , which combined those of paper and wax , dead in such different ways . The skull had been enlarged , to receive so much mechanical and electronic apparatus : another Sovietism , the dictator reasoned  --  for with their superior **25;5159;TOOLONG the Americans could have fitted all this into the skull of a mole . Yet , despite the small distortion of scale , Ellellou , hugging the head to his chest to break the last stubbornconnections , found tears smarting in his eyes , for in life this head , mounted atop the closest approximation to a father the barren world had allowed him , had never been held by him thus , and the act discovered the desire . They had been two of a kind , small cool men more sensitive than was efficient to the split between body and mind , between thought and deed . The king had prepared him to rule , though it had meant his own ouster . " A king must be a stranger , " he had told his ambitious attache . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his people for their misery . " A king must be a stranger : this truth , peculiarly African , rustled in Ellellou 's own skull while the desecrated other pressed its little fig of a nose , rubbery in reconstruction , against his hushed heart . Then the affronted electronic engineers , and a motley guard clad in indigo Tuareg robes and green soldiers ' uniforms , burst from their hidden places and encircled him with intent to kill . Russian , Wanj , Arabic , Tamachek were shouted ; Ellellou 's galabieh was rudely tugged and Edumu 's head was torn from his arms , though the riband of gold , the dwindled veil of a sacred presence , remained in his fist . His captors , pressing close about him , had terrible breaths : not only vodka but the spoiled yeast of native beer and the sourness of millet porridge licked from dusty fingers mingled fiercely in the captive 's face , along with an unaccountable distant sweet tang , of barbershop hair-oil.  | " Je suis Ellelloil , " he said , repeatedly , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accent was not understood . He was struck beside the ear ; a scarlet numbness overspread his face from that portion ; he was spat upon , mistily ; his arms were pinioned and his wrists twisted as an unseen other struggled with his fingers for the golden headband . The pressure ceased , the uproar was quelled . Opuku and Mtesa had stepped forward , gleaming in the nakedness of power , Opuku 's machine gun a beautiful mitrailleuse after a design by Berthier , oiled like a Nubian whore , and Mtesa 's .44 magnum scarcely less enchanting . A patriotic poster was unfurled beside Ellellou 's face ; the crowd of tourists , comprehendinglittle and cowering back from the violence , applaudedas if this comparison were part of the show , of the Kush national heritage . Indeed , the slide show had automaticallycontinued throughout , planting a Berber grin squarely upon the grimace of a furious technician , and the next instant projecting upon our struggle the pastoral peace of a herd of sheep overgrazing the Hulul Depression . Due to the poor photogravure of the poster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forward and shook my hand ; I recognized , amid the cocoa-paste of his absurd disguise as a nomad , the shallow , tilted , alert , hunted yellowish eyes of his race . " Colonel Ellellou , " he said , " je presume . " " Colonel Sirin , " I remembered . " Death to the people 's enemies and revisionist **30;5186;TOOLONG they may be found , " he said , through his translator , who had appeared at his side in the baggy costume of a bespectacled Maoist sightseer . " Just so , " I said , and nodded toward the dreary relic of Edumu IV where it lay on the cavern floor , one more piece of debris , debunked , inoperative , a prop at the back of the stage . " Have you asked yourself , " I asked the colonel , " if your perpetration of this charade does not constitute a seriousp218breach of the treaties between our two great democratic na-tions ? " The ' colonel shrugged and talked at Russian length , words that were translated as , " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of detente , our government has instructed us to mingle more freely with the local populations . " " There was no population here , until your contraption attractedit . Even so , the audience is composed of day-trippers from Zanj , with whom our border will be henceforth closed . Your plot has served to put a little profit into old Komomo 's pocket , but has left the loyal citizens of Kush unmoved . " " Not quite unmoved , Comrade ; for the First Citizen of Kush has personally come far to attend to the oracle , as we knew he would . " The colonel was shedding his shamed face and costumed unease , and his affectation of omniscience rankledin conjunction with the recalled ordeal of his bunker hospitality  --  his drunken toastmaking , his materialist cliches , his atheistical mockery . The Koran says , Woe to those who debar others from the path of Allah and seek to make it crooked . And the king had once advised me , Enemies are a spiritual treasure , allies a practical burden . In his swinish Slavic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ devious interferences was now shared , debonairly lit a KocMoc cigarette , that went ill with his rags and his paint . It came to me that in addition to closing the Zanj border I should abrogate the missile treaty , as Ezana had often advised : thus I was thinking fondly of Ezana at the very moment , give or take a minute , when he was falling in love , over cocktails and freezedriedpeanuts , with Mrs. Gibbs , her brassy hair playing PingPongwith points of light in Mr. Klipspringer 's freely administeredbourbon . The wires leading into my head were as many as those into the dismantled king 's . I told the smirking colonel opposite , " And the oracle spokep219a great deal of facile , impudent , and traitorous nonsense , in the style of that messiah of bourgeois self-seeking , the Zionist Sigmund Freud . " " The oracle spouted not only psychology , but geography as well  --  did you not notice ? " " The rumor of the metropolis in the Ippi Rift I take to be as phantasmal as the gadget 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a metropolis , but a small industrial city , of the type you call  --  " Consultation with his translator finally produced the word , " upstate . " " With variegated housing and charming recreational sites , " the translator added . " Not an encampment of beggars could exist there , " I told them , " but that the Minister of my Interior would have informedme . In our sublime vacancy even the birth of a camel makes vibrations . " The colonel smiled , and flakes of cocoa-paste fell from his cheeks . " The Minister of your Interior you have judged , correctly , to be a traitor . Also he is a man who dislikes friction . Your Soviet friends , however , remain true to the Revolution . In alerting you to danger , we have gone to some lengths to avoid your official channels , which are rotten with revisionist spies . " Ellellou saw that truly he must travel on , westward to the Ippi Rift ; but as this new leaf of adventure unfolded before him he felt only an exhaustion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a long track to arrive at what should have been theirs from the start : an identity , a fate . His trip to the Balak had been , in its wantonness , its simplifying hardships , freedom ; his trip down from the Massif , by the unscenic highway , in the air-conditioned Mercedes , without his beloved Sheba , heartsick duty . Sheba had vanished in the tumult that hadp220surrounded his uprooting of the head ; in what shadows and by what hands she had been seized remained mysteries . The Russians , anxious to dispel the suddenly hysterical President 's threats of abrogation and anarchy , had assisted in the furious search . Every cranny of the cave was probed ; the apparatus of audio-visual illusion was overturned ; the technicians ' lockerswere ransacked , even the refrigerators in the cafeteria , even the caviar barrels . She was not in the cave . She had been taken outside , then . The clefts of the rocks were searched , while pigeons wheeled overhead and Ellellou in an agony of remembrance relived running his fingers along the clefts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wistful thin melody of her anzad , the rounded perfection of her glossy shoulders and blue-black thighs , the velvet caress of her lips on his indifferent member , her stoned docility and soft intermittent plea that there must be a better life than this . The taste of her , Ellellou remembered , the kola in her kisses and the salt of her female secretions that mixed with the alkaline dryness of borax when , on the dirt beneath the stars , he would perform cunnilingus . The fast food and soft drink stands were one by one overturned and smashed as at Ellellou 's command the Kushite soldiers the Soviets with usurped authority had enlisted joined the frantic search . Divorceme , she had begged , after telling him , You make what I do seem very little . The tourist buses , wheeling in the parkinglots with their squealing loads of curiosity-seekers from Dorset and Canton , were halted , and the passengers made to stand with their arms above their heads in the now-vicious noonward sun , as small in the sky as a pea , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commanded . " Rape them ! " The soldiers , bewildered teen-agers fresh from the peanut fields and the fishing villages , attempted in their innocence to obey , but the beatings were feeble and the objects of rape , witheredp221and twittery in their long-sleeved English gardening dresses and floppy rose-gathering hats , were unappetizing . Russian engineers , galvanized by Ellellou 's fury , went through the buses with measuring tapes and hand computers , hoping to deduce a space where the priceless bride might be concealed . Tires were slashed , windshields smashed . The drivers , detribalizedZanjians preening hitherto on their trousered power to steer machines bigger than elephants , were pummelled for the fun of it . " Destroy ! " the dictator cried , to the consternationof the Soviet colonel . " Destroy everything in this vicinity not created by the hand of God ! " " But the concrete walkways  --  " " Shall be reduced to rubble . All this was imposed without my authority ; by my authority all traces of desecration shall be removed . " " We obtained permits , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Department of Forests and Fisheries  --  all forms in order  --  a boon to future travellers  --  Eurodollars . " His translatorwas struggling to keep up . " Travellers , " Ellellou sweepingly replied , " were never meant to trivialize these peaks . But find me my Sheba unharmed , Colonel Sirin , and we will let this amusement park endure as a memorial to the happy event . Otherwise by my decree its desolation shall forever objectify the desolation of my heart . " " I offer a theory , " the translator said in his own words , whether couched in sloshy French or muddy Arabic , I forget . " There were among us some authentic Tuareg , acting as advisers , scouts , and regional experts . " In the exhilaration of speaking his own thoughts he went on , " Do you know , some say  --  it is very interesting  --  the Tuareg are descended from Christian medieval crusaders who strayed ; hence their fre/quent use of the cross as decoration , and their chivalric refusal to work with their hands ? " " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these kafirs ? " It was soon discovered , amidst the swirling dust of poured concrete being pulverized and immobilized buses being overturned , that there were only false Tuareg , that the true had fled . " They will sell her to the Yemenis ! " Ellellou cried . " If so , " the translator offered , " that too is not without historicalinterest , for Yemen was , in Biblical times , the land ofSheba . Perhaps she will feel at home there . " She would have a kitchenette , a frozen food locker , a little ranch house with chimes for a doorbell and Muzak piped into the den . She would wear an apron and house slippers , she would learn to push a vacuum cleaner . She would forget him ; he would shrink to the size of a hi in her mind . The strong man wept . Ellellou ordered Opuku to line up all the tourists and machine-gun them . His child , like himself , would have a rumor , a gust of wind , for a father . This fantasy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a conviction as , having left the contrite Soviets in charge of restoring their developed hectare of the Balak to its pristine condition , Ellellou descended in the Mercedes westward toward the Ippi Rift . The hum of the highway dulled his ears . His mind was carried back to the times when he and Oscar X and some one or two others ( such as John 46X , who had kicked the heroin habit with the aid of Allah , had tried out for defensive lineman with the Packers , and had shoulders as broad as Opuku 's , so when he came along Felix had to sit in the back seat ) would descend south from Franchise to worship at the temple in Milwaukee or , an hour farther to the south , the Holy of Holies in Chicago.  |p223The  green fields of Wisconsin would swing past like the swells of a soft sea . The white barns and silver silos bespoke an America where they in their gas-guzzling , mufflerless Olds were a devilish impurity , black corpuscles cruising along America 's veins , past heaves of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ocean , had been memorized by farmers ' footsteps , generation after generation . Over the car radio came Doris Day and twanging country plaints and , as the city neared , Dinah Washington and the rickety , jolly , **26;5218;TOOLONG man 's jazz . Those tinkling notes never failed to catch the edge of the wave . Set on a ridge with the pride of a castle , a gaunt gabled farmhouse kept company with its one big tree . Poverty had roofed a house here and there with a patchwork of discounted shingles six different colors . Felix was fascinated by the power-line towers , steel skeletons whose shape suggested giants daintily holding threads of pure force in tiny arms hanging straight down , insulators . The delicate grandeur of their latticed forms repeated to the rolling horizon , and in moments the swiftly altering perspective from the back seat stamped one upon the other ; such moments , like those of deja vu , were thrilling , with a resonance beyond their visual proof that the towers diminishedalong a perfectly straight line . And Felix felt a meaning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left , slatted structuressolemnly designed , cut , trussed , and nailed to carry a commercial message fleetingly ; one billboard had a curved silhouette which a backwards glance revealed to be that of a pickle , and another the outline , ominous when seen from afar , of a steer advertising his own demise through the channels of a local steakhouse . In the occasional distance a water-tower stood on its long legs like a Martian invader puzzling what to do next . In winter these fields turned white , white sprinkledwith the black calligraphy of snow fences and leaflessp224trees , a landscape as void of growth as the one his gray car was endlessly speeding through , gobbling one horizon only to be faced with an identical other . At times the dictator wanted to flog his country for being so senselessly vast . The day arched like a blinding headache above their endless meal of kilometers . Ellellou , alone in the back seat , his motionlessness a mask for his suffocating struggle with the resurging , undownable fact of Sheba 's absence , was slow to sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emanating from the back of Opuku 's round bald skull , connected to the mass of his shoulders by a glistening pyramidal neck . Ellellou recalled that he had never heard machine-gun fire , though he had ordered some . He leaned forward and asked , " The tourists  --  did they die well ? " Opuku held silent . Ellellou persisted , " Or did they die ignobly , begging and cackling for mercy ? Pigs . " He quoted , " When the Hour of Doom overtakes them , the wrongdoers will swear that they had stayed away but one hour . " Opuku confessed , " I did n't shoot them . I told them , Run away into the rocks . Those too frightened and feeble hid behind buses . " Ellelloft , his heart engulfed by rhythmic waves of grief , asked his bodyguard why he had thus betrayed L'Emergence . The motions of his heart , when he focused upon them , were like the attempts of a man with clumsy mechanical hands to drown in a bucket of bendable , skidding plastic a cat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " Those poor toubabs just dragged in by Zanj tourist package . Old ladies . Gentlemen marabouts . " " Capitalist vermin , " Ellellou replied apathetically , gazingp225out the window at the streaming void . " Warmongers and exploiters . " " Slant-eyes too , " Mtesa pointed out . " Nixon-lovers , " was the reply , still lacking in spirit . But he did not like Mtesa 's siding with Opuku . Their little counterrevolutionmust be quelled . The President took his eyes from the congenial dun vacancy visible and sought to ignite with a spark of his old fervor the predictable kindling of his rhetoric . " You had the gun in your hands and their faces before you , " he told Opuku , " and pity intervened . Pity is our African vice . We pitied Mungo Park , we pitied Livingstone , we pitied the Portuguese and let them all live to enslave us . " A sickening clothy memory , of Sheba mounted on her pink camel in full regalia , squeezed his body down , so his discourse continued in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a toubab 's accounting sheet , and further imagine that by inking you out , you and a thousand others , he can save a dollar , a shilling , a franc or even a lu on the so-called bottom line . Do you imagine , Lieutenant Opuku , that his finger will hesitate to pull that particular trigger ? No , the ink will flow . You will be Xed out by Exxon , engulfed by Gulf , crushed by the U.S. , disenfranchisedby France , not only you but your entire loving nation of succulent wives , loyal brothers , righteous fathers , and aged but still amusing mothers . All inked out , absolutely , without the merest flourish of compunction . In the vocabularyof profit there is no word for pity . ' So your squeamish refusal to follow my distinct orders was a laughable freak , a butterfly from the moon , speaking an incomprehensible languageto these deaf and dumb earthlings , who have no hearts , whose bodies are compounded of minerals utterly foreign to your own elastic arteries and stalwart bones . These people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government-financed  --  Iam obliged to point out  --  machine gun ,  |p226your  superb Berthier mitrailleuse , would have constituted an act of erasure impeccable in its innocence , as well as being a gift of obedience pleasing to your President , and a polite enough message that even old addle-pated Komomo , the king clown of pan-African confusion , might have comprehended . Opuku , remember the Book : Mohamet is Allah 's apostle . Those who follow him are ruthless to the unbelievers but merciful to one another . " Ellellou sank back into the velour , exhausted . He tucked little remembered bits of Sheba  --  her earrings , the fleshy bump in the center of her upper lip  --  around himself like ends and corners of a blanket . But he could not doze ; the tension in the car remained . Opuku smoked a plastic-tipped cigarillo , having sulkily removed the highly crinkly wrapper , and Mtesa steered unswervingly through the flatnesses of the Ihoo , a plain of hardened talcum hammered to its present form by millennia of the sun 's stagnant fury . In such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself , though his eyelids closed . He saw green fields , the slatted backs of billboards , and heard Mtesa suddenly grunt . " Another truck ? " Ellellou asked . He was resigned , now , to such wonders multiplying . " No truck , sir . Look to the left . " Perhaps seven kilometers to the south , a lost city shimmered  --  one of the red cities that , some archaeologists believe , the refugee royalty of conquered Kush erected in what was then grassland . Others thought they were Christian monasteries , whose cells were later used to house the harems of wilderness sheiks expatriate from Darfur . The stones of the walls , bluespeckledbricks it takes two modern men to lift , are silent , and for all their solidity have crumbled , so that at this distance , to Ellellou 's eyes , which also were not what they once were , they suggested that ring of fragile shred which remainsp227when a wasps ' nest is knocked down . Out of this ragged papery rim rose , still intact and scarcely weathered , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nowhere . Meanwhile ( to extrapolate ) , at a choice table of the **29;5246;TOOLONG East Germans had installed on the top story of their skyscraper , Mrs. Gibbs , Mr. Klipspringer , Michaelis Ezana , Kutunda Traore , and the young police spy in the plum-colored fez were enjoying a glittering luncheon . Ezana was happy , in his element among the twinkling importedcutlery and crystal steins , talkative , giddy on Liebfraumilch , and in love with the brassy-haired American widow , whose natural grief was underlined by stomach troubles and an ear problem originating in the imperfectly pressurized Air Kush 727 . Ezana was showing off his African cynicism and gift of tongues , and though his coquetry was wasted upon its object , it was enjoyed by her benignly smiling , heavy-lidded , delicately mustachioed escort , the professionally patient Mr. Klipspringer . " Your Mr. Nixon , " Ezana prattled in his musical , trippingly accented English , " I do not think this Watergate matter should do him any harm . How could such a puny contretemps offset his stirring accomplishments of the last six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relations with Egypt , created trustworthy governments in Chile and in Greece , providedhimself with a new Vice-President as tall and handsome if not as eloquent as the old , and enhanced the American economy by arranging with the Arabs to double the price of oil . Truly , a charismatic dynamo , who has fascinated the American people again in the workings of their own democ-racy. "  |p228Kli|ps|pringer  chuckled . This man , what good nature , what tireless tact ! " Maybe so , Mike , " he allowed . " But from where I sit he looks like a loser . " " Indeed , a loser in a narrow sense ; but reflect upon the purgative value of a leader who unravels before a nation 's riveted eyes . If he falls , he will carry your nation 's woes with him into the abyss . Twice recently , if I mistake not , your federation has been humiliated , by the North Vietnamese with their mortars , by the Arabs with their embargo . What more poetic and profoundly satisfying "  --  here he bestowed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was studying her plate wondering what , exactly , had gone into this sausage  --  " psychotherapy , if my term is correct , than the evisceration of a President , out of whom tumble in majestic abundance tapes , forgeries , falsified income taxes , and mealymouthedlies ? This is theatre in the best African tradition , wherein the actor is actually slain ! " " Your own President , where is he ? " asked Angelica Gibbs , prodding herself out of absorption with her own , obscurely troubled interior . Ezana translated the inquiry into Sara for Kutunda and Fula for the man in the fez , who both laughed , that wicked bubbling African laughter connecting directly with the underworld ; it rang in Ezana 's ears as a permutation of his own intoxication with this tired-looking , diarrhetic angel who had come from afar to sit opposite him across the **37;5277;TOOLONG linen . Instead of answering her , he lifted a fork before his face and said through its thoughtfully twirled tines , " The channelsof the mind , it may be , like those of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the word ? If we think always one way , these lie down and grow stiff and cease to perform their cleansing function . The essence of sanity , it has often beenp229my reflection , is the entertainment of opposite possibilities : to think the contrary of what has been customarily thought , and thus to raise these little  --  cilia , am I wrong ?  --  on end , so they can perform again in unimpeachable fashion their cleansingfunction . You want examples . If we believe that Allah is almighty , let us suppose that Allah is non-existent . If we have been assured that America is a nasty place , let us consider that it is a happy place . " " It 's the place for me , " Mr. Klipspringer cheerfully interposed , " and I 've been to Hell and gone . When I see that old soapy-looking Capitol dome from the window of the jet , I think , This is it . This is me . " Ezana would not cease his flirting with the poor fatigued Mrs. Gibbs . " Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a master of such alternations of assumption . Let us suppose , he says , that China is not a bad place but a good place , a friendly place . We have many pleasant Chinese restaurants in the United States , he reasons , perhaps China is equally pleasant . Or let us suppose , he says , that the way to rule is not to lead and inspire the people but to hide from them , to absent oneselfincreasingly , like the ancient Tiberius , who frolicked upon his island while Jesus Christ was spreading subversion  --  are my facts correct ? " " I never heard it put quite that way , Mike , " Klipspringer said , closing his lips then upon the wetted end of a Cuban cigar , which had cost him twenty lzz in a basket shop where stacks of them were rotting , and crossing his eyes to ignite the other end with a propane-flame lighter . The man in the red fez noticed the lighter with admiration , and Klipspringer passed it to him . " It 's yours , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand . And , with further delightful gratuity , blew a perfect smoke ring , that came spinning from beneath his pert mustache like a new-fangled missile.  | " Our President also , " Ezana continued to the pallid Americanbeauty , " rules by mystical dissociation of sensibility , if I understand the phrase . Leaving the development of a plausible pragmaticism to those of us that stay behind in fallible Istiglal , he explores the wider land for omens , to discover the religious source of the drought . " The man in the red fez , who was growing to understand more English than the others expected , interrupted with a spate of local language to which Ezana listened at first amusedly , then with some gravity . By a smart soft chop of his hand the speaker indicated he wished Ezana to translate . " He says , " Ezana told Klipspringer , " there is no drought . The nomads have survived many worse , by loaning their cattle to sedentary farmers in the south and reclaiming them when the dry sahel recovers again . The introduction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made this system difficult . The farmers no longer traffic with nomads , they need paper money to buy their wives Japanese sandals and transistor radios . And he says furthermore the wellmeaningwhite men drilled wells and vaccinated against rinderpest , and this increased herd size to the point where desert was formed by the livestock . He says there is no drought , just bad ecology . " Klipspringer 's eyebrows were elegant silvery structures , trimmed but not overtrimmed , riding up and down on the emotions behind his brow like the vessels of Ra on eddies of spirit . They had arched high , lifting his heavy careful lids ; in the space thus cleared his liquid brown eyes poured forth to the faces at the table all their luminous gift of caring . His baritone trembled with emotion . " Mike , " he said , " you tell the man for me , No problem . Our technical boys can mop up any mess technology creates . All you need here is a little developmental input , some dams in the wadis and some ex/tensive replanting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revolution have come up with . You have a beautifulcountry here , basically , and we 're prepared to make a sizeable commitment to its future . You tell the man we 're very sensitive to the ecological end of things , not to worry . They were worried in Alaska and now they 've stopped worrying . The caribou 've never been better off . Miracles are an everyday business for our boys . " " I want this murderer brought to justice ! " Mrs. Gibbs suddenly cried from the depths of her sorrow and impatience , her queasiness and interrupted sexuality . " I want Don avenged . " Baring her teeth , she exposed a fleck of lipstick on one incisor . Klipspringer put his hand adroitly over hers . " Angelica , revenge is n't part of the international picture . Internationally speaking , revenge is a no-no . What we have instead are re-alignments . " " Madame is a guest of the state ; " Ezana reassured her . " It pains me to think she should be denied anything she desires in Kush @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infatuation with this freckled she-devil from the land where ice grows downward , launched into a long story of how she had been taken captive by Ellellou ; he had broken into her hut where she slept , the chaste daughter of a widely respected dibia , and had desecrated her body with his urine so that , unmarriageable , she had no choice but to become his concubine . He kept her in a closet , illiterate , and compelled her to perform unclean acts ; he even refused to give her typing lessons . The young man in the fez , whose Sara was nearly as good as his Fula , expressed rapture at her telling ; he choked back his laughter , lest he miss a word . Ezana 's Sara was not fluent enough to follow the torrent of vigorous and redolent idioms , and hep232contented himself with saying brusquely , at the tale 's end , to the white widow , " This lady , a cultural attache , also has grievances against our President . It is regrettably true , he has committed many unpopular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always happy . He put to death our old king , whom many of the river-folk superstitiously ven-erated . " " Where is he ? Where is he ? " Angelica all but screamed . " He has ventured , you might say , upon a good-will mission , " Ezana said , glancing at the black face of his wristwatch , as if space as well as time were packed into its shallow depths , like life in a coil of DNA . " It is hard to say where . " " Where  --  iss  --  ee ? " the Acting Minister of the Interior suddenlyenunciated , in halting but vivid English . " Ee  --  iss  --  here ! " Everyone laughed , except Mrs. Gibbs , and Ezana turned to Klipspringer . " Let us discuss what you call our expanding relations . If the Braille Institute is to be built , it must be by local laborers , enlisted from our new masses of the urban unemployed , and following an indigenous design , in conformitywith African humanism . " The American diplomat lowered his eyelids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plate holding a few discreet shreds of sauerkraut and the rubbery tied ends of his consumedknackwurst . " You bet , " he said . " Maybe with a little souklike string of shops , boutiques and travel agencies , nothingnoisy , along the ground-level mall . We want to help you become yourselves . A settled identity is the foundation of freedom . An unsettled nation is an enemy of freedom . A nationhates America because it hates itself . A progressive , thrivingnation , whatever its racial balance and political persuasion , loves America because , frankly , in my not so unprejudiced opinion , but the facts pretty well bear me out , America is downright lovable . America loves all peoples and wants themp233to be happy , because America loves happiness . Mr. Ezana , you and the boss-man here "  --  his hand chopped toward the wearer of the plum-colored fez , who obligingly smiled and underneaththe table squeezed Kutunda 's knee so hard her own smile widened with pain  --  " may wonder why the American revolution has lasted nearly two hundred years , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , All our Founding Fathers promised was the pursuit of happiness . Our people are still pursuing it , they 'll never catch up to it ; if they did , they 'd turn right around and blame the Revolution . That 's the secret , if you follow me . " " Ed , cut it out , " Mrs. Gibbs said . " What are you doing about Don ? " " We 're working on that , " he assured her . " First you said you wanted his ashes , now you want revenge . " " There is a city , " Ezana offered , " perhaps prematurely named , we might instead call Gibbsville . " " Where is this city ? " she asked . A spark of communication ran around the ring of faces , and Ezana sadly confessed , " We are not at liberty to divulge . " She looked at her companions at the table and saw through her tears black faces smilingly sealed upon secrets , secrets . Ezana looked at her and saw beyond the brassy toss of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make a panoramaaround the restaurant , at such a height above the city no odor or peep of misery could arise , Istiglal to the southeast : the bristling rectilinear business section directly underneaththe skyscraper , narrow polychrome boxes whose sides were scrawled with lettering in many languages including even the native Hindi of the shopowners ; the rows of camels and bicycles tethered and parked in the clay square of the Mosque of the Day of Disaster ; the mosque itself , its minaret a dusky phallus , its dome a blue-tiled breast ; the boulevardsp234the French had diagonally cut through the maze of mud rhomboids and irregular alleyways ; the dead chestnuts and poplars lining the boulevards and resting like a tenebrous cloud upon the pastel villas of Les Jardins ; the scrappy glintingquilt of the shantytown at Al-Abid ; to the left , the airport and the slender road to Sobaville ; to the right , the venerable jumbled hump of Hurriyah lifted like a coy shoulder into the rosy cliff of the west wing of the Palais d'Administration des Noires ; beyond , the souk and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a black curve of the blue Grionde . I love you , I love you ran through Michaelis Ezana 's mind dizzily , and the white woman 's weary queasy face , the merrimentarising between the red fez and Kutunda 's bleached hair , the American 's blanketing gray confidence that all would be taken care of  --  all merged in this embracing , spiralling , panoramic feeling . In Kush , the politics of love was being born . The Ippi Rift is a global curiosity that hides itself among the valleys of Northern Europe , belches forth its tensions at Mount Etna and the Valle del Bove , slips beneath the Mediterranean , and continues south to the vicinity of Johannesburg . Astronauts in their orbits see it plainer than China 's Great Wall . Those who live in it do not see it at all . According to the theory of continental drift , the Rift marks the line along which Africa will eventually break in two  --  not , as would seem from a human standpoint sensible , along an eastwestaxis , so that the Islamic/Caucasoid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fifteenth parallel , but longitudinally , with all our latitudinal diversity of race and climate not only preserved but duplicated . The lengthy fault , whose incidents include the Oresund , the po/litical division of the Germanies , Lake Tanganyika , and the Kimberly diamond fields , excites geological aberrations , and there have long been rumors of oddities  --  oases , rumblings , auroras  --  in its vicinity as it cleaves the otherwise featureless desolation of central Kush . Nevertheless , the President of the nation was surprised , on the second day of his droning , mournful ride with the sulky Opuku and the evasive Mtesa , by the bulge of emerald that jumped through their windshield at a turning of their descent , in second gear , down the steep , pink-gray slope of the Rift 's eastern bank . In some parts of the world this green would have been a simple suburban lawn ; here it appeared with an evil intensity , as a sudden face of Roul . Back upon the lawn crouched a menacing fabrication , a low " ranch " house , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aluminum siding that feigned the wooden condition of clapboards . Similar , though not quite identical , houses were arrayed along both sides of this road , which had become one of those curbed asphalt curves real-estate developers dub " crescents . " Lawn sprinklers hurled rainbows against the crystalline aridity of the air . Otherwise there was no sign of life , not even a lone postman . The children must be at school , the housewives at the supermarket . Or else the whole development was a mock-up constructedto torment him . Ellellou felt a skimpiness , a threadbare nameless something as of those towns that come and go while the passenger dozes above the road map in his lap and the driver fiddles with the radio , seeking a non-religious station . As for the unbelievers , their works are like a mirage in a desert . The thirsty traveller thinks it is water , but when he comes nearer he finds that it is nothing . He finds Allah there , who pays him back in full . Too soon , considering the spaces the city-builders had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with supermarkets and trash dumps and low windowless go-go dives . In the front seat , Mtesa and Opuku were becoming noisy ; they had never beforeseen gasoline stations with plastic twirlers , or ice-cream stands in the shape of a sundae cup , with a painted cherry on top doubling as an air-conditioner vent . Or the golden parabolasof a MacDonald 's , a meagre hutch of an eatery dwarfed by both its monumental self-advertisement and its striped lake of a parking lot . The sight of these wonders at first caused them to mutter and then to jubilate aloud , hilariously , as people will laugh with terrified exhilaration when immersed in the mist and tumult of a waterfall . The straightaway thickened into a drab little " downtown , " with pavements and traffic lights . Here , the sight of their countrymen wearing cowboy hats , blue jeans , tie-dyed Tshirts , and summer-weight business suits provoked even louder delight , infuriatingly , for Ellellou was trying to plan his attack , to screen out the superfluous , to concentrate . He put on his NoIR sunglasses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young girl , younger and coarser than Sheba , but with a touch of the ruminating insouciance Ellellou painfullyremembered , strolled past beneath the awnings , beside the parking meters , wearing an apricot halter tied high , tattereddenim cut-offs the buttocks of which were patched with two faded cotton heart-shapes , and shiny-green platforms ten centimeters thick at the heels . She was chewing bubble gum with all of her brain . Opuku leaned out and called to her in demotic Arabic , " Where you goin ' , little girl ? " " Wherever you ai n't , fat man , " was her answer , capped by a popped bubble , which sprung forth fresh hilarity from the two soldiers . The girl , who had delivered her rebuff with yet that Ian/quid provocative sideways tug of the eyes that Kushite women affect in potentially compromising social intercourse , was strolling past the window of a cinq et dix , and the illassortedmuchness of its windows  --  the gimmicky , plasticky , ball-and-jacky , tacky , distinctly dusty abundance of these toys , tools , hobby helps , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ destroy , to simplify , to make riddance of . His hands trembled . He tried to reason . This excrescence in the heart of Kush was not lava , it was an artifact , a plurality of artifacts , that had been called here by money . Where money exists , there must have been pillage : Marx proves this much . There must be capital , exploitation , transmutation of raw materials . In a word , industry . Where there is industry , there is machinery , delicately poised and precariously adjusted . This poise , this adjustment , can be destroyed , and the whole devilish fabric with it . There was a blue-collar stink to this town . Franchise had been cleaner , with its breezy lake , its ivied sanctuary . Many of the men on this street wore oily coveralls , and some affected aluminum hardhats . Ellellou bid Mtesa stop the Mercedes before the entryway to an Army and Navy store , which , he discovered within , catered principally to the proletarian fads of youth , and was so far , here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that its stock , especially for a man of Ellellou 's precise and wiry stature , was absurdly limited . In exchange for his khaki uniform  --  the Galla trader behind the counter was happy to have it , for the sheen and softness acquired during natural wear can not be machine-imitated , and is much prized by the young  --  and several thousand lu Ellellou obtained a pair , not of the greasy gray coveralls conspicuous on the streets but of blue bib overalls stiff with newness and double-stitching , an antique pith helmet in lieu of a hardhat , and a lemon-yellowp238T-shirt upon which were stencilled the words Left Handers Are Easy to Love . Thus attired , the dictator commenced , as was his way , to mingle with his people , leaving Mtesa and Opuku illegally parked in a loading zone . The Saharan sun beat down dryly upon the twinkling conveniencesof this doomed suburb of nothingness . Ellellou felt this doom blazing within him . Thirsty , he entered a corner drugstore . It was cool within . Tall phials of colored water symbolized the healing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with dust , untouched . The commercial contents of the shelves were a mere scattered shadow of the merchandise of the drugstore in Franchise . Lest the reader imagine that the disembodied head 's facile diagnosis of the dictator 's supposed psychotic condition was here being borne out by an hallucinatory echo of Franchise , Wisconsin , he should understand that this city was in every respect inferior to that prosperous lakeside paper-town ; it was a Third-World stab at an industrial settlement , scarcely a block deep on either side of the main " drag , " thin of soil and ' devoid of history and shade trees , its citizens transparently African , its commercialismsketchy and even , one could say , humorously half-hearted . Franchise was to this place as a fondly pruned and deeply rooted hydrangea bush would be to a tumbleweed . The druggist , a tall black Hassouna in the traditional highbuttonedantiseptic jacket , glanced at the disguised tyrant 's pith helmet with amusement . " Allah is good , " he said . " How can I serve you , sir ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have a soda fountain ? " " Such frills went out of modern use years ago , " the druggist explained , " when the minimum wage for soda jerks went skyhigh . You are living in the past , it seems . A machine that vends cans of soft drinks purrs in the rear of the store , next to thep239rack of plastic eggs holding gossamer panty hose . Take care , my friend , not to drop the pull-tab , once removed , back into the can . Several customers of mine have choked to death in that manner . We call it the Death of the Last Drop . " " I also , effendi , need advice , " Ellellou told him , less timorousnow that he had caught something of the man 's accent and style . For all its brave show of consumer-goods , the shop seemed infrequently visited , and its keeper had not lost the desert love of conversation . Words will bloom where nothing else does . Ellellou confided , " I am looking for useful work . " The druggist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his hands , which were long and limp as rags . " What sort of work might the gentleman be able to perform ? " The dictator was at a sudden loss . Fakir , digger , orangepeddler  --  hiscostume corresponded to none of his priorly assumed professions . He thought of Mr. Cunningham , his patchy florid face , his starched white shirts . He said , " I am in the insurance racket . I am a claims adjuster . " " I have heard of such men , " the druggist admitted . He straightened up with startling briskness , as if suddenly awakenedto the possibility that this stranger might be a hold-up man . His voice took on a solemn hollow threatening tone . " Well , sir , around here , the only work is to be had at the wells . Without the wells , and the toubab know-how , this would still be wilderness . You have heard , I dare say , of the wells ? " " Of course , " Ellellou lied . " A tremendous natural resource , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replaced his tattered elbows upon the glass case , which his dusting had revealed to contain packets of candy-colored condoms and a fan of cream-colored vibrators , like smooth flashlights searching in all directions . " Hydrocarbons , " the druggist intoned . " That is the future inp240a word , sir . The path away from poverty , the redemption of the nation . Gross national product , balance of trade , you know all these terms , I am sure . They might well have need for a man of your experience , sir . I have heard tell of accidents amid the machinery , of near-explosions . I recommend that you apply , and my baraka go with you . Would you like to freshen up on your way to the personnel offices ? Some deodorant , a swig of mouthwash ? Personal hygiene counts for a lot with these infidels . God sees the soul ; men smell the flesh . " A wearisome fellow , really . A nation of shopkeepers is a morass of pleasantries . Woe to the economy that puts its goods on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ furiously . Nationalize . He asked , " How do I find these wells ? " " You follow your nose , man . Where have you been living , beneath the ground ? " " I have come from the Balak , " the traveller apologized . " I have been a long time tracking down a claim . Permit me one more question , of a simplicity that may astonish you . Pray , what is the name of this town in which I find myself ? " The druggist indeed looked astonished . " Ellellou , " he said . He straightened again to his height before the banked Latinate myriads of his medicine-shelves , his dried herbs , his poisons distilled from convolute carnivorous flowers , his love-potions , sleeping-potions , antihistamines , and diuretics . " El/el/oil , " he boomed , with the volume of a muezzin calling . " Our national independence leader , a god descended to us to fight for our freedom , a great man whose iron will is matched by his penis of steel . " The druggist leaned far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not among those who with the archtraitorMichaelis Ezana conspired against the purposes and teachings of our inspired head . " " I am a pimple apolitical professional man , " the disguisedp241dictator replied , with dignity , " seeking employment in the midst of a drought . " " No drought here , my good man . Our peerless leader , whose enemies foreign and domestic gnash their teeth in vain , perceived that the Rift , in its geological contradictions , would trap all life-enhancing fluids  --  water and petroleum , to name the foremost two . " Ellellou had the irritating impression , from the discontinuousvigor with which the druggist adopted one manner after another , of a systematic insincerity that might relate ( it occurredto him ) to his failure to make a purchase . Still thirsty , but embarrassed and anxious to be off , he said in farewell , " God is good . " " God is great , " was the disappointed answer . Outside , the Saharan sun pounded down upon the faded awnings , unlit neon signs , and brick false @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the End of Woe . Ellellou entered a luncheonette , narrow as a running man 's stride and every surfaceof it coated with a film of wiped-away thumbprints and spillings . He ordered a lime phosphate , which he drank up with a single long lunge through the straw . The short-skirted waitress read his T-shirt and giggled . Her face was ugly  --  her teeth stuck straight out  --  but her legs were firm and smooth and the color of good healthy shit . He ordered a second lime phosphate and took it to a booth . Each booth had a mockivoryselector for the jukebox at the back of the luncheonette , and he was surprised , flipping its yellowed leaves , to recognize some of the songs : " Sixteen Tons , " by Tennessee Ernie Ford ; " The Rock and Roll Waltz , " by Kay Starr ; " Blueberry Hill , " by Fats Domino ; " My Prayer , " by the Platters . This last he could almost hum , as green fields and silver silos skimmed by . He began to feel bloated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , its oft-wiped smoothnessp242too much like the blankness of the sky . Ellellou got up , paid , tipped the waitress a lu , and left . As he went out the door , the jukebox began to play , very scratchily , " Love Letters in the Sand . " A siesta emptiness possessed the streets . At the intersection where the Avenue of the End of Woe met another , an oblong traffic island held a statue of himself in bronze  --  even his sunglasses and bootlaces in oversize bronze , his face deep in shadow , his kepi and epaulettes whitened by guano  --  within a fountain , whose rhythmic surges of water tossed upwards veils and ghosts of spray that evaporated before the droplets could fall back into the stone bowl from which these patient explosions were fed . Around the rim of this great bowl the nation 's twelve languages spelled their word for Freedom . In Wanj there was no word , all of life was a form of slavery , and this gap in the circle of words children had worn smooth , clambering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now . They were captive in school , he imagined , thinking of how aptly this fountain symbolized the universe , that so dazzlingly and continuously pours forth something into nothing . Sinuous green growth of a Venezuelan density flourished in the lee of the fountain , whose wafted breath licked him like a tongue as he crossed the shimmering intersection . Alone on the pavements with his sharp small shadow , helmeted and baggy , Ellellou followed his nose . The shopping district thinned to barbershops and grimy-windowed printing emporia with cases of their alphabets gathering dust beside the quiet presses . Low cafes and pombe bars awaited the after-hours wave of worker clientele . Single-bladed ceiling fans desultorilyturned within ; there was sawdust on the floors , and big green bottles keeping cool under soaked burlap . An odor met his nostrils as sulphuric even , as caustic and complex , as the scent of the lakeside paper mills in Franchise . There , too ,  |p243there  had been , along the approaches to the industrial heart of the place , its satanic raison d'etre , this multiplication of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overwhelmingly mingled with low cinderblockbuildings enigmatically named or in naked anonymity serving the central complex , which was enclosed in apparent miles of link fence hung with scarlet signs warning of high voltage , explosive materials , and steep fines for even loitering on the fringes . Ellellou approached this fence and looked in . Across a large margin of macadamized desert that made absolute dimensions difficult to grasp , a dark heap of slant-roofed sheds , inscrutable chutes , black-windowed barracks , tapered chimneys , towers with flaming tips , and rigs for pounding pumps belched forth a many-faceted clatter and the oceanic chemical stench of hydrocarbon refining . The ball-topped fractionating towers , the squat storage tanks were linked to their underworld source of supply by a silver spaghetti of parallel piping . Little pennantsof burn-off flame adorned the construct like a castle . Though Ellellou 's eyes spotted few human figures , which perhaps in this uncertain scale would have been invisible , the whole monstrous thing was delicately in motion , eating somethingfrom the soil and digesting it into a layered excrement palatable to the white devils @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , churning , throbbing emissary of consumerism , the lavender western wall of the Rift , too precipitousfor any road , too barren for any life , hung like a diaphanous curtain behind which waited like a neglected concubine the idea of Kush . But Ellellou could not smell the desert . Everything in the land his heart knew had been erased , save the blank sky , its blue so intense it verged on purple , overhead . He moved along the fence , through the litter of drainedp244cans and discarded brown pay-envelopes , until he came to a guard post , a plywood shack no wider than a telephone booth , and asked the man slumped in there for admission . " Show me your pass . " " I have no pass , but I have business inside . " " Those at the main gate will determine that . What sort of business ? You are dressed like a fool . " " I have a claim to adjust . I am a claims adjuster . There has been an accident inside . " This guard , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him suspiciously . " There 's been no accident here . " " From my mother I inherited the gift of foresight , maybe the accident is soon to occur , " Ellelloft replied , and was about to improvise an ingratiating fable when he recognized the other man . " Wadal ! " he cried . " Wadal the well-digger  --  have you forgotten your servant ? We met north of the Hulul , in Ramadan , and together we repelled the American infiltration . " From within the hood of his burnoose Wadal studied me with deepened suspicion , and placed his hand on the rifle in the sentry box . " I remember much confusion and smoke , " he said . " And my Kutunda being taken from me . " " Kutunda for whom you had no use , and whom you had taken from another , and who in turn has been taken from me , by one who will not keep her long . You exploited her because you have been exploited . Let me in , Wadal , and we will bring these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is fuel for much smoke here . " He was still trying to fix me in his mind , as , emerging from the shadows of his tent , a traveller squints to distinguish mirage from mountain . " You claimed to be Ellellou , " he said , " and were clumsy with a shovel . " " I was clumsy because you chose unworthy places to dig . But now your nose has led you nobly . How did you come top245this place ? How long has it been here ? How is it capitalized , and who provides the expertise ? Who is its manager , its president ? " " We never see him , and we never ask , " Wadal said , still unfriendly , the gun brought in close to his body . Through a rent in his burnoose I glimpsed his penis , languid . " He feeds us and pays us , and that is enough . He generates employment and boosts the gross national product . A few more wells , and we will be another Libya , another Oman . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replied . He commanded , " Admit me to this inferno . " Instead of obeying , Wadal lifted his rifle as if to strike with the butt . A happy spark , the prospect of righting an old imaginedwrong , lit his morose face from within ; but at that moment a gray Mercedes in the silence of its perfect workings slid by on the crackling , littered gravel alley that ran beside the fence , and Wadal lowered his weapon . Ellellou waved the car on , and turned his back upon the guard , having formed a more visionary plan than brute coercion wherewith to secureadmission . He went back through the streets of this new world named for him , into the barbershops and drugstores , the economy furniture outlets and the cinq et dix stores , the pombe bars and real-estate offices , the dens where men labored to repair electricalappliances engineered to be irreparable and the cinemas where numb heads pondered giant pink genitals laboring to symphonic music , and Ellelloft asked the citizens of Kush he found in these places , " Are you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a grunted " What 's it to you ? " or a defiant " Yes " or an equally defiant " No " or an evasive measured response , he pursued the issue , saying , " Those who are not perfectly happy , follow me . " And some did , though many did not , and some others were drawn along with thep246crowd , attracted by its promise of excitement , its air of destination , for they led lives of relative prosperity yet were kept by the very nature of the economy , its need to justify production by exciting consumption , in a low fever of dissatisfactionand ill-defined hopefulness . This little brown man , with his attractively fanatic military bearing in his crisp and absurd costume , fed that hopefulness , as does a comet , a mass murderer , a state lottery , an albino camel , or any other such remission from the hunger pains of the ordinary . With a mob at his back Ellellou demanded admission at the main gate . Wadal must have alerted his employers of impending trouble , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ padlocked pipe-and-wire gates , and a toubab had been produced from within the insidious alchemy of the oil works . He was short and pink and flustered ; he wore a button-down shirt with rolled-up sleeves and had several pens clipped to the pocket . In the past , some had leaked , leaving blue spots . This was a mere desk-worker , a timid engineer , an agent of agencies in distant cities of glass . He was no taller than I , and his eyes peered levelly into mine through his rimless spectacles and the electrified mesh . " You want work ? " he asked . " I want justice . We want reparations . " " Uh  --  think you 've come to the wrong place . Has n't he ? " He made this inquiry of a tall black Nuer who had appeared beside him , clad in a three-piece checked suit of some slitherysynthetic summer stuff , his shoulders wide as a buzzard 's wings , a clipboard in his hand . " You bet the punk has , " this black man said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What 's the story , buddy ? " His brow bore the Nuer scars but his American English was smooth . " I am Ellellou , " I told him . " Sure , and I 'm O. J. Simpson . You do n't look so easy to love to me. "  | " The shirt is not my message . My message is , Justice , or Destruction . " " How about that ? What sort of justice you have in mind ? Big justice , little justice , or justice of the peace ? " " Justice for all . These citizens of Kush behind me claim to be imperfectly happy . " " So that 's news ? They sure as hell busted their asses to get here . Look , I do n't know how well you know the local situation , but it 's not exactly a hotbed of alternatives . We do n't ask ' em to come to us , we fight ' em off . This is a pilot project , we 're trying to keep it low-profile . " Ellellou @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he spoke to the plump white devil . " By whose authority was this project established ? " " Everybody 's , as I understand it . We deal with the Ministry of the Interior , mostly . The President 's a canny type who 's lent his name but keeps his distance otherwise . The initial contacts were finalized before my time ; they only keep us here a year , it 's considered hardship duty . My company 's cut of this operation is peanuts , but the top brass back in Texas has a soft spot for the Third World . The chairman of the board came up from a turnip farm . " " This is n't business , " the P-R man interposed , a bit stiffly , in unspoken rebuke of his superior 's garrulity , " this is philan-thropy . " Ellellou asked the toubab , " You are yourself not top brass ? What is your title ? " " Engineer 's my title ; recovery 's my racket . A new strike like this is an oddball at this late date , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the game . Hydraulics and fluids have been my life . It 's a miracle , what you can squeeze out of a rock if you know where to pinch it . There 's enough water down there in domes to flood the Hulul. "  | " Beautiful , " said the engineer , chattery with the relief these infidels feel when discussing their work in avoidance of emotionalor ideological issues . " It comes up so sweet you could gargle it . Prettiest sludge I 've seen outside of Oklahoma . You know oil ? When you crack most crude by the Burton process  --  " The P-R man interrupted . " You are wasting your time with this man . He is a terrorist . He has no interest in real information . " " Anyway , " the toubab lamely concluded , reluctant to leave his specialty , " your Mr. Ezana , he 's pleased as punch , and he 's got reason to be . " The crowd , bored by a technical conversation they could not hear , was beginning to chant , " Ellellou @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his winglike shoulders and Nuer brow scars correctly scented danger in the situation , though he pretended not to recognize his President . At his command a small army of harried , bearded boys had appeared bearing a tangle of wires and an assortment of electronic boxes  --  loudspeakers , transformers , tuners . This system was set up on the parched earth . When the connections had all been made , he took up a hand mike of the phallic type , with a glans of soft black rubber , - whoo fed into it experimentally , and , satisfied , spoke : " Ladies and gentlemen , workers and independent tradesmen , all citizens of Kush irregardless of tribe and tint : return to your homes and places of business . This madman , no doubt inspired by religious impulses he deems genuine , has misled you with a vision of unreal happiness . Your hopes of real happiness , that is to say , a relative absence of tension and deprivation , lie not with absolutists and charismatics but with an orderly balance of capitalist incentives and socialist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with your native resources and ingrained cultural patterns . " He consulted his clipboard , and continued : " The African humanism of your forefathers , as over against the antlikesocieties of Asia and the neurotic sublimations of the Christian West , urges upon you the ideals of patient cheerful labor , intuitive common sense , and a many-stranded web of kinship ties that reinforces rather than dilutes individuality . Do not , ladies and gentlemen , yield your priceless personhood to destructive gestures by alleged saviors . There is no God , though you are free to worship as you wish , as you are free to indulge in bizarre sexual practices with another consenting adult . " The speech went on too long , not so much for the crowd , which , ceasing to chant " Ellellou , " had fallen under the spell exerted by oratory in our still predominantly oral culture , as for the American , who , natively impatient , of short attention span , and anxious to make an impression of himself as a genial and forceful fellow not prone to " stand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fair play , " took the microphone from his eloquent assistant and awkwardly boomed into it : " Open the gates , we 're not afraid of these good folks . Industry 's been a fine friend to this oasis , and by golly we intend to continue to be ! " The gates were swung open , the mob laughingly pushed through . The young technical crew hastily relocated their equipment and unsnarled the wires , and in the confusion Ellellou  --  gently , as if lifting a little burden from the pink hand , a flower or libation proffered in homage  --  took up the microphone himself . It was as if he had seized a gun ; he became potent ; the crowd halted , conceding him a little stage of bare earth . His heart was pounding ; his hand , holding the instrument , looked to his own eyes small and magically withered . He was beset by variable mental winds . The thought of Shebap250returned to him  --  her dull betrayed eyes sought his from within a crush of cloth and coral  --  and with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman , a woman who would lull him out of anger and put him to bed . But then he began to talk , and the breath of his throat as it leaped the inch between his lips and the spongy tip of the microphone was in his ears taken up by an amplified echo that seemed to blanket the world and impose a hush upon all its multitudinous contra-indications , and his heart was at peace in the center of the storm of his voice : " Citizens of Kush ! You have been grievously betrayed ! You have been led by the atmospheric machinations of Roul the desert devil , in league with the dead hand of Edumu the Fourth and the living perfidy of Michaelis Ezana , to dwell in this pestilential hellhole called Ellellou ! I am Ellellou ! I am freedom ! " He took off his pith helmet , to show his visage . The cheering was less than he expected . The P-R man had made a move to grab the mike , but now stood idly by , close , checking the integrity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impudent attempt at distraction . " What is freedom ? " Ellellou went on . " Can you put it on with chains , can you hold it within stone walls , behind steel doors , in the circumference of electrified fences ? " " The fences are electrified for the safety of juveniles and stray dogs , " the P-R man swiftly whispered . Ellellou spurned the clarification , urging into the amplifying system the swollen self-answer , " No . These heavy material things do not bestow freedom , they bestow its opposite , bondage . Freedom is spirit . Freedom is peace within the skull . Freedom is righteous disdain of that world which Allah has cast forth as a vapor , a dream . The Koran says , The mountains , for all their firmness , will pass away like clouds . The Koran asks , Have you heard of the Event , which will over/whelm Mankind ? Freedom is foreknowledge of that Event , whose blazing light is the only true light , whose fire melts our chains and evaporates the walls of our impoverished lives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Make your pitch . We can give you five more minutes . " Ellellofi said , and the microphone turned his words into clouds , scudding above the choppy black sea of the faces of the crowd , " You see at my side a bought black man , dressed in a white man 's suit and taught to mouth the white man 's glib tricknology . You see at my left an authentic pink devil , as apparently mild as the first suck of milk a baby lamb takes from its mother in the misted dawn pasture , but in truth as poisonous as the sting the scorpion saves for the adder . You see at my back a monstrous pyramid , foul in its smell and foul in its purpose , a parasite upon the soil of Kush and a corrupter of its people . As your President I command you , as your servant I beg you , to destroy this unclean interloper . A few well-aimed bullets should do it . The conflagration will lighten your hearts forever , and become the subject of a song @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advocating violence , " the white man said , behind Ellellou 's back . " He 's got to be kidding , " the P-R man reassured him . He held up three fingers where Ellellofi could see them , to indicateto the orator that , by some arcane rigor of technology , only three minutes were left to him . " The beast behind me , drinking the sacred black blood of our earth , belching smoke and blue flame , and defecating the green by-products of petroleum , " Ellellofi enunciated into the microphone , " is a mortal creature like any other , and I advise that my soldiers direct their first bullets into its jugular vein-that is , the exposed conduit removing the volatile gasolinevapors from the top of the fractionating tower , belowp252the condenser ball . " He wondered at himself , that he could spout all this ; it was like holding live coals in the mouth , all it took was saliva and faith . Yet the soldiers did not shoot . They stood in their green uniforms within the motley crowd , innocent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waiting for an apparition they could take an order from . Ellellou strove to become that apparition , with only his voice and two more minutes of electricity to lift him above the mass . The crowd , in its still good-humored bafflement and wishing perhaps to touch the fabulous electronic equipment , which in flaking gilt bore the name of a now-dismantled , drugs-scuttled rock group called Le Fuzz , crowded closer , menacingly close . As he tried to gather his inner forces to speak , he was aware at his back of the P-R man and the white engineer scratching quick memos  --  contingency plans , " scenarios "  --  to one another and also of , high in his nasal passages , an incongruous odor overriding the chemical stenches of industry . The smell had a penetrating sweetness , it carried with it woolen clothes and falling leaves and rosy Caucasian cheeks , it was , yes , the fresh glazed doughnuts the Off-Campus Luncheonette peddled to students as they sought a refuge from the sub-zero Wisconsin cold on mornings between classes . The doughnuts were laid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their dough so cunningly fluffed it melted to a sugary nothing in the mouth , leaving flakes of glaze on the lips  --  how could that scent , forerunner of the taste , be present here , so vividly that Ellellou , in this pause of his oration , salivated ? No snack-cart for the workers was visible ; yet the scent lived in his nostrils . And in his ears the scratching pencils of his enemies . These distractions joggled the fragile chalice holding the distillate of his message , his cosmic indignation , and prevented , perhaps , from being as good as it should have been this , the last speech of his public career.  |p253He  returned , in a low-pitched , factual voice , to the theme of petroleum by-products . " What does the capitalist infidel make , you may ask , of the priceless black blood of Kush ? He extracts from it , of course , a fuel that propels him and his overweight , quarrelsome family  --  so full of sugar and starch their faces fester  --  back and forth on purposeless errands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do in the same village with our kin and our labor , the Americans have flung themselves wide across the land , which they have buried under tar and stone . They consume our blood also in their factories and skyscrapers , which are ablaze with light throughout the night and as hot as noon in the Depression of Hulul ! My people : in my travels , undertaken only for love of you that I may better bear your burdens , I have visited this country of devils and can report that they make from your sacrec blood slippery green bags in which they place their garbagE and even the leaves that fall from their trees ! They make o petroleum toys that break in their children 's hands , and hai : curlers in which their obese brides fatuously think to beautify themselves while they parade in supermarkets buying fooc wrapped in transparent petroleum and grown from fertilizer based upon your blood ! Of your blood they make deodorant to mask their God-given body scents and wax for the matche to ignite their death-dealing cigarettes and more wax to shin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burnin sands barefoot ! " A new scent , also sweet but astringent , had arisen ; he grope to identify it , while returning to larger , more spiritual themes " Such are the follies of a race that scorns both Marx an , Allah . The world groans beneath the voracious vulgarity a these unbelievers . They suck dry vast delicate nations in th service of the superfluous and the perverse . The earth , miscor strued as a provider of petty comforts and artificial excite ments , can not but collapse into a cinder , into a gnawed bonp254whirling in space . Hasten that Day of Disaster , blessed soldiers of our patriotic army , and shoot the giant slave of grease mercifully in the throat , and restore this ancient Rift to its pristine desolation , beloved of Allah , the wise and all-know-ing ! " Ellellou identified the odor that had intruded : it was of the pink , " sanitizing " cake of soaplike substance that reposed within the bottom lip of urinals in the men 's " rest " rooms of some American service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until he had been acclimated enough to understand it intuitively . " You may say these wells have brought water . I say the Almighty could have made a river flow in this Rift . You say grass grows here now , where sheep can feed , and date palms , and orange trees , and what can not be grown is purchased . I say , the Sahara once was altogether green , and the Merciful bestowed upon it a superior beauty , the beauty of the minimal , the changeless , the unpolluted , the necessary . The battle now in the world lies between the armies of necessity and those of superfluity . Join that battle . God has placed in your hands today the power to pulverize and incinerate this evil visitation , this malodorous eruption ! " But had he , intuitively or otherwise , understood its essence ? The pink cake of strange substance , no doubt petroleumderived , had sat across the porcelain slots meant to carry urine away ; what purpose did this obstruction serve ? A spiritual purpose , that of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of purity . " You say , " he called into the microphone , which now seemed the narrow neck of a great echoing calabash trumpet , " that life here is hard and the drought has made it harder . I say , the unclouded sky mirrors the unclouded heart of Kush , the heart released from the tyranny of matter . Magnify yourp255Lord , cleanse your garments , and keep away from all pol-lution . " The devils behind him were still consulting . The crowd , whose depths and reaches he could not see , felt to his sense like a sail on far-off Lake Timmebago , at that instant when either the wind would catch , bellying the sail out taut , or else , the wind 's drift having been misjudged , the sail would luff . " My people : your President has carried our drought in his heart heavily , it has nearly dragged me down , until I made this recognition : the drought is a form of the Manifest Radiance , and our unhappiness within it is blasphemy . The Book accuses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cradle to the grave . The Book promises : You shall before long come to know . Indeed , if you know the truth with certainty ; you would see the fire of Hell : you would see it with your very eyes . Come , my people , let us build a great pyre . The white devils and their machinery have entered by the gate of our weakness , our wandering and unsteady dedication to the ideals of Islamic Marxism , the beauty of L'Emergence , the glory of Kush that was the envy of the Pharaohs and anathem to the Christians of Axum ! Redeem your wandering , my people ! Destroy this vile temple to Mammon ! Soldiers , shoot ' Ellellou orders you to shoot ! ! " In the answering , teetering silence , the P-R man 's voic ( muttered , " O.K. , that 's plenty . " The microphone was pullet from the dictator 's hand . The P-R man said into it , " Thc management has a question I 'm sure everybody here woulc like to hear your response @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're Colonel Ellellou ? " " It shall now be proven , " he said serenely , and waited fo the crowd to give way before the irresistible certification the Presidential Mercedes . But the crowd failed to move as a single thing , as a sea pushesp256iside ; instead , each head oscillated expectantly , amusedly , while the minute yielded no unifying phenomenon . Ellellou stood on tiptoe , then attempted to jump himself higher by placing a hand on the P-R man 's winglike shoulder . He saw neither Mtesa nor Opuku  --  no , on the third leap , there was Opuku , standing as a passive spectator just outside the fence with , the fourth jump revealed , the gum-chewing girl in the apricot halter . Of Mtesa and his Mercedes there was no sign , except possibly the scarlet letters , quickly faded to salmon in the Sahara sunshine , atop a ramp-riddled concrete structure , spelling PARK . Beyond this sign , the sky was blank . The crowd , as no omen materialized , began to rumble , cheated . The white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harrow-marks of a comb fresh in his thin pale hair , hair the color of the dung of a sick goat  --  said into the indispensable microphone , " Whaddeya think , good people ? I think we 've given this fella his chance . Any of you folks thirsty , you can have one free beer each at the commissary , to the right of the front door as you enter . Do n't push , there 's plenty for everybody . " " This is treason , " Ellellou managed to shout , his last official utterance , before the crowd with murderous jubilation rolled over him . He became a beanbag , a toy . The wells continued to pump , and on the other side of town the lawn sprinklers continued to twirl . A little cloud covered the sun.  |p257The  struggle between man and fate is a totally alien concept to Arab culture. - SAHAIR EL-CALAMAWY , 1976I LIVE . Perhaps the white devil 's offer of free beer saved mylife , for the crowd was in too much of a thirsty hurry to halt and pummel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instill . One cracked rib , a fat lip , the removal of my shoes , the bestowal of a quantity of derisive spittle , and they were through with my body . The life of a charismatic national leader can not be all roses . My wallet , with its rainbow of lu , its snapshots of my four wives clothed and my mistress Kutunda in the nude , its credit cards and plastic perpetual calendar and embossed national air alert codes and Brezhnev 's unlisted telephone number , had also been lifted , and no doubt this semeiotic treasure-lode enriches the arcana of some lightfingeredex-nomad secure in his niche in the burgeoning oil industry . A little picturesque behanding would set the rascal straight , I think  --  but then my judicial opinion is no longer solicited . To be barefoot and walletless in Kush , in even this modern/ized pocket of it , is to be at no very striking disadvantage . A few days and nights of soggy mendicancy , while the monsoon rains pattered down with their pre-Emergence verve , and during which I was kicked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ellellou , served to adjust me to the fact that I had indeed been abandoned by my bodyguard among the masses with whom it had once pleased me whimsically to mingle . After the loss of Sheba , such a fall followed as one segment of a telescope brings with it another , slightly smaller . No one to blow me , no one to bow to me . Takbfr ! I was driven to look for work and shelter amid the happy mud . In my student need across the seas I had held a variety of lowly jobs  --  " nigger work , " in the friendly phrase of the lily-white elite of Franchise . The very luncheonette where , in the twilit last hours of my Presidency , I had treated myself to not one but two lime phosphates , hired me as a counterman , once I had demonstratedsufficient mastery of the junk cuisine with which the iron-stomached Satans of North America are poisoning the world . Cheeseburgers , baconburgers , pepperburgers ; fried eggs in all their slangy permutations of ups and downs and overs ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all within my repertoire at the sizzling , curdling grill . Egg rolls and pizza arrived frozen from the poles of Marco Polo 's travels , needing only to be warmed . " Hero " sandwiches were cannibalized by my customers , who still believed , primitively , we become what we eat . From six to two , or from two to ten , I chopped , flipped , served . I juggled the orders in a rolling sea of music , for if the customers did not feed the ivory tune-selectors , Rose , as the toothy leggy waitress was called , did . She was a maddening hummer-along , and yet disappointingly uncooperativein other respects : my attempts to seduce her fell on barren soil  --  her hard-packed determination to achieve , withp259her husband Bud , upward mobility . They lived in an aluminumbox on the edge of town , equipped with a chemical toilet and a fold-away kitchen sink . Once this domicile was mortgage-freethey planned to sell and move onwards to a **26;5316;TOOLONG house , with one-and-a-half children . The next stage of escalation would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course , while Bud squirmed upwards through the greased tubing of the refinery . Such progress in husbanded half-steps was freedom to Rose , and my sidling attempts to drag her off the bandwagon into my anarchic arms were as idle as an attempt to seduce a locomotive from its tracks . No virtue as iron as that forged on the edge of poverty . When he came into the luncheonette , Bud , a big Moubi with arms that could have hurled a spear seventy meters , sat with those mighty arms meekly folded on the godless Formica as he stared up into the spectral works of a hierarchical machine , his lips pinched in unconscious imitation of the white man 's scolding visage . They shared , as she slaved , one dream . Her only strayingwas in her head , as the lukewarm melodies bathed our ears in their moony ache day after day . Kush was the last stop on a long descent through levels of national development ; these records , their grooves scoured of all but hoarse ghosts of song , had taken twenty years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ America of the Fifties . Over and over , hearty , hollowly healthy voices blended with violins toward an uplifted climax of pre-rock wail , a ululant submission to the patriotic , economic call to sublimate . " Love Me Tender , " the youthful Presley requested ; " Cry Me a River , " Johnny Ray begged ; " Que Sera , Sera , " Doris Day philosophized , her voice snagging each time on some thorn in my soul . The regal voices of Grace Kelly and Bing Crosby lightly entwined in the drifting waltz of " True Love , " and Debbie **26;5374;TOOLONG " Here 's his address in Lisbon , Pam . You do it . " Slote hastily scrawled in a notebook and tore out the sheet . " And look , the Poles here are amassing a book of their documents . I can get you the galley proofs . What 's more , they 've got a man who escaped from Treblinka , this camp up here "  --  a skinny finger jabbed at the sketch on the desk  --  " near Warsaw . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nerve , just to bring photographs and tell the story .

Pug Henry alive and safe ! Returningto Washington ! This put a new light on her plans , on her life . As for Slote 's " scoop , " he seemed to her more than a hit obsessed . She could almosthear her father saying , " No chance . None whatever . Old stuff . " The new stuff was victory  --  victory in North Africa , in Russia , in the Pacific ; victorytoo against the U-boats , after four years of catastrophe , the true great turn of the war . That the Germans were terrorizing Europe and maltreating the Jews was as familiar as the tide tables . " Leslie , I 'll talk to my editor-in-chief tomorrow . " Slote thrust an emaciated hand straight at her . The palm was wet , the grip loose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days . Call me either at the Dorchester or the American embassy , extension 739 . " As he put on his fur coat and cap , the old Paris smile lit the gaunt face and haunted eyes . " Thank you for the booze , old girl , and for listening to the Ancient Mariner . " He stumbled out . The editor-in-chief listened to her next day in a bored slump , gnawing at his cold pipe , nodding and grunting . The Polish government-in-exile , he said , had long since offered him all this material . He had run some pieces . She could see these in the files , standard propaganda stuff . By any journalisticstandards the stories could not be verified . The business about the plan to kill all the Jews was coming from Zionist sources , to pressure Whitehall into opening up Palestine for Jewish immigration . Still , he would be willing to see Mr. Slote next week . Oh , the man was leaving tomorrow ? Too bad . But when she offered to go to Washington and write some stories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , why not ? Do try your hand , Pam . We know you were drafting Talky 's copy toward the last . When will you let us have Sunset on Kidney Ridge ' ? We 're frightfully anxious for it . " Slote knew of two Foreign Service officers who had disappeared on ferry command bomber flights between Scotland and Montreal . The North Atlanticsky was not the route of choice , certainly not in midwinter . Big comfortableairliners flew the southern route  --  down to Dakar , a hop across sunny seas to the bulge of Brazil , then north to Bermuda and so on to 13x1 timore . But that was for big shots . The choices offered him were a ten-dav voyage in a convoy , or an RAF ferry coinmand trip.  |p501On  the train to the Scottish airport , he fell in with an American ferry pilot going the same way : a wiry middle-sized Army Air Corps captain with a toothbrush mustache , a wild eye , three banks of ribbons on his khaki tunic , a richly obscene vocabulary , and a great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compartment to themselves . The ferry pilot kept nipping brandy , explaining that he was getting plastered and intended to stay plastered until they were well off the Prestwick runway . Crashing on takeoff was a hazard at Prestwick . He had attended two mass funerals of pilots who had died on the runway . Dangerous overloads of gasoline had to be accepted , when you were flying westward into North Atlantic gales . The ferry command had to keep hauling pilots back , because shipping disassembled aircraft by sea was slow and cumbersome , and the U-boats got too many of them . It was the ferry pilots who were really building up the Allied air forces in the war zones . Nobodygave a shit about them , but they were the key to the whole war . As the old dusty train clanked its slow way through snowy fields , the pilot regaled Slote with his autobiography . His name was Bill Fenton . A barnstormer before the war , he had since 1937 been doing various flying jobs , civilian and military , for various governments . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hump , " he called it ) ; taking off from a runway that had to be cleared of cows and water buffalo by a honking jeep , then climbing five miles and more to get over icy storms that whirled higher than Everest . He had joined the Royal Canadian Air Force to ferry planes to England . Now he was flying bombers for the Army Air Corps via South America to Africa , and on across to Persia and the Soviet Union . He had crash-landed in the desert . He had floated for two days in the Irish Sea on a rubber raft . He had parachuted into Japanese-held territory in Burma , and walked out to India on foot . By the time they reached Prestwick in a snowstorm , Slote was not only tired , sleepy , and drunk from his share of Bill Fenton 's brandy ; he had a whole new vision of the war . In his fumed brain pictures reeled of aircraft crisscrossing the globe  --  bombers , fighters , transports , by the thousands  --  battling the weather and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; crossing oceans , deserts , high mountain ranges ; a war such as Thucydides had never imagined , filling the skies of the planet with hurtling machines manned by hordes of Bill Fentons . He had not until now given the war in the air a thought . For once , the everlasting Wannsee Protocol , the map of Poland with the three black circles , and the European trains carrying hundreds of thousands of Jews each month to their deaths faded from his mind . He was moreover so scared at the prospect of the flight that he could hardly walk off the train . When they arrived at the airfield the plane was warming up . Waddling out of the check-in office in cumbersome flying suits , heavy gloves , and life vests , with parachutes dangling behind their knees , they could not at firstp502see the aircraft through the falling snow . Fenton led him toward the motor sound . It was inconceivable to Leslie Slote that a machine could take off in this weather . Inside the four-engine bomber there were no seats . On the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pallets . Slote 's armpits coldly dripped and his heart raced as the plane heavily took off . Fentonscreamed into his ears , over the engine roar and the groan of retracting wheels , that the weather briefing predicted headwinds of a hundred miles an hour . They might well have to put down in Greenland , the asshole of the Arctic . Leslie Slote was a coward . He knew it . He had given up fighting it . Even riding in a car with a fast driver gave him bad nerves . Every airplane ride , just a one-hour hop in a DC-3 , was an ordeal . This man now found himself in a stripped-down four-engine bomber , setting out to cross the Atlantic westward in December ; a howling rattletrap that sucked in the cold through whining and whistling air leaks , climbed through hail that made a machine gun racket on the fuselage , and bucked , dipped , and swerved like a kite . Slote could see , in dim light from iced-up windows , the greenish faces of the sprawled pilots , the sweat-beaded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mouths . The fliers looked fully as terrified as he felt . ' Fenton had explained on the train that the North Atlantic head winds were strongest at low altitudes . Planes flew high to climb over the weather and conserve fuel in the thinner air ; but up there they could accumulate ice too fast for the de-icers to work . Also , the carburetors could get chilled from pulling in subzero air , and they could ice up . Then the engines would quit . That no doubt was the way so many planes vanished . When ice began to build up you could keep trying to climb above the wet cold into the dry cold , where one needed an oxygen mask to survive . Otherwise you had to drop back down fast , maybe down to the wave tops , where warmer air would melt your ice . Against his better judgment , Slote had asked him , " Ca n't the icing conditions prevail right down to the water ? " " Hell , yes , " Fenton had answered . " Let me tell you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a long hideous anecdote about a near-spin into the water off Newfoundland under a heavy ice load . The plane kept climbing and climbing ; loose things persisted in sliding toward the rear . Some pilots huddled under ragged blankets and snored . Fenton too stretched out and closed his eyes . A sudden metallic crashing and banging along the fuselage stopped Slote 's heart , or so he felt . Fenton blinked , grinned at Slote , and pantomimed ice forming along the wings , and rubber de-icers cracking it off . Slote wondered how anybody could sleep in this howling tortinr chamber in the sky , hammered at by breaking ice . He could as soon sleep ,  |p503thought  , nailed to a cross . His nose was freezing . There was no sensation in his hands or feet . Yet he did doze , for a nasty sensation woke him : a smell of rubber , a cold thing pressed to his face as in anesthesia . He opened his eyes in the dark . Fenton 's voice yelled in his ear , " Oxygen . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was stumbling here and there with masks that trailed long rubber tubes . Slote thought he had never been so cold , so numb , so sick all over , so ready to die and get it over with . All at once the plane dived , roaring . The pilots sat up and looked about with white-rimmed eyes . It was an obscure comfort in Slote 's agony that these skilled men were so scared , too . After a horrendously steep long dive , ice crashed along the fuselage once more . The floor levelled off . " Never make Newfoundland , " Fenton yelled in Slote 's ear . " Greenland it is . " Ven Der Fuehrer says , " Ve iss der Master Race , " Ve Heil ( phfft ! ) Heil ( phfft ! ) Right in Der Fuehrer 's face . In the wooden barracks beside the Greenland runway , this song was grinding out of the phonograph , hour after hour . It was the only record on hand . The airfield , a treeless spread of steel netting sunk into mud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than Slote had imagined could exist on earth . The runway was short and chancy , so the refueled aircraft had to wait for endurable takeoff conditions . Not to luff Der Fuehrer Iss a great disgraceSo ve Heil ( phfft ! ) Heil ( phfft ! ) Right in Der Fuehrer 's face . Here in this witless ditty , Slote thought , was the fatally soft American idea of Hitler and the Nazis  --  the ranting boob , the dumbbell followers , the hells and the razzes . The musical arrangement mixed various funny noises  --  cowbells , toy trumpets , tin cans  --  with the oom-pahs of a Germanband . The pilots were playing cards or lolling about , and when the record ended somebody simply moved the needle back to the start . Fenton lay on the bunk underneath Slote 's , leafing a girlie magazine . Slote leaned over and asked him what he thought of " Der Fuehrer 's Face . "  |p504Fenton  yawned that it was getting to be a pain in the ass . Climbing down , Slote sat beside the captain and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ observing that when a song like that could amuse people , it was small wonder that nobody believed what was happening . Turning the pages of naked females , Bill Fenton calmly remarked , " Shit , man , who does n't believe it ? I believe it . Those Germans have to be weird people , to follow a nut like Hitler . Some of them are fine aviators , but taken as a nation they 're a menace . " Ven Herr Goebbels says , " Ve own de Vorld and Space , " Ve Heil ( phfft ! ) Heil ( phfft ! ) Right in Herr Goebbels ' face . Ven Herr Goering says , " Dey 'll neffer bomb dis place , " Ve Heil ( phfft ! ) Heil ( phfft ! ) Right in Herr Goering 's face " But what can anybody do about the Jews ? " Fenton tossed the magazine aside , stretching and yawning . " Fifty million people will die before this war 's over . The Japs have been fighting the Chinese since 1937 . Do you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Maybe ten million . Maybe more . You ever been to India ? There 's a powder keg . The British ca n't keep the lid on much longer . When India blows , you 're going to see Hindus and Sikhs and Moslems and Buddhists and Parsees cutting each other 's throats till hell wo n't have it . The Germans have killed a lot more Russians than Jews . This world is a slaughterhouse , man , it always has been , and that 's what all these fucking pacifists keep forgetting . " Iss ve not der Supermen ? Aryan pure , Supermen ? rah ! ve iss der Supermen Sooper DOOPER Supermen ! Fenton enjoyed the sound of his own voice , and he was getting worked up . He sat erect and poked Slote on the shoulder . " Tell me this . Is Stalin any better than Hitler ? I say he 's the same kind of murderer . Yet we 're flyinghalf of the bombers we 're producing over to him  --  free , gratis , and liir nothing , and some damn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm risking my own ass . And why ? Because he 's our murderer , that 's why . Were notp505doing it for humanity , or for Russia , or for anything except to save our own asses . Christ , I feel sorry for the Jews , do n't think I do n't , but there just is n't a thing we can do about them but beat the shit out of the Germans . " So ve Heil ( phfft ! ) Heil ( phfft ! ) Right . . . in . . . Der . . . Fuehrer 's . . . face . At the enormous Canadian Air Force Base outside Montreal , Slote telephonedthe Division of European Affairs , and the division chief told him to hurry along to the Montreal airport and catch the first plane to New York or Washington . While this was going on , Fenton passed the telephone booth . A tall pretty girl in a red fox coat was clinging to his arm , hips rolling with each step , devouring the pilot with lustrous green eyes . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man-to-man grin , and the ferry pilot passed from view . A short life and a merry one , thought Slote , with a flicker of rueful envy . To his pleased surprise , Slote found that he did not mind the takeoff of the DC-3 , or the bumpy climb through heavy clouds . The airliner seemed so huge , the interior so luxurious , the seat so broad and soft , the stewardess so entrancing , that it was more like being on the Queen Mary than on somethingflying through the air . He cold not tell whether the bomber ride had cauterized , as it were , his fear of flying , or whether he just had no nerves left , and was on the verge of a total crack-up . Anyway , not to be frightened was delightful . He had snatched a Montreal Gazette from the newsstand . Now he unfoldedit , and a picture of Alistair Tudsbury and Pamela on the first page made him sit up . They stood beside a jeep , Tudsbuiy grinning in balloonlike army fatigues , Pamela looking pinched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ KIDNEY RIDGEBy Alistair TudsburyBy wireless from London . This dispatch , dated November 4 , 1942 , the famous British correspondent 's last , was dictated shortly before he was killed by a landmine at El Alamein . Edited by his daughter and collaborator , Pamela Tudsbury , from an unfinished draft , it is reprinted by special permission of the London Observer . The sun hangs huge and red above the far dust-streaked horizon . The desert cold is already falling on Kidney Ridge . This gray sandy elevation is deserted , except by the dead , and by two intelligence officers and myself . Even the flies have left . Earlier they were here in clouds , blackening the corpses.  |p506They  pester the living too , clustering at a man 's eyes and the moisture in the corners of his mouth , drinking his sweat . But of course they prefer the dead . When the sun climbs over the opposite horizon tomorrow , the flies will return to their feast . Here not only did these German and British soldiers die , who litter the ground as far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Here at El Alamein the Afrika Korps died . The Korps was a legend , a dashing clean-cut enemy , a menace and at the same time a sort of glory ; in Churchillian rhetoric , a gallant foe worthy of our steel . It is not yet known whether Rommel has made good his escape , or whether his straggle of routed supermen will be bagged by the Eighth Army . But the Afrika Korps is dead , crushed by British arms . We have won here , in the great Western Desert of Africa , a victory to stand with Crecy , Agincourt , Blenheim , and Waterloo . Lines from Southey 's " Battle of Blenheim " are haunting me here on KidneyRidge : They say it was a shocking sightAfter the field was won , For many thousand bodies hereLay rotting in the sun ; But things like that , you know , must be After a famous victory . The bodies , numerous as they are , strike the eye less than the blasted and burned-out tanks that dot this weirdly beautiful wasteland , these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shadows on the pastel grays , browns , and pinks of the far-stretching sands . Here is the central incongruity of Kidney Ridge  --  the masses of smashed twentieth-century machinery tumbled about in these harsh flat sandy wilds , where one envisions warriors on camels , or horses , or perhaps the elephants of Hannibal . How far they came to perish here , these soldiers and these machines ! What bizarre train of events brought youngsters from the Rhineland and Prussia , from the Scottish Highlands and London , from Australia and New Zealand , to butt at each other to the death with flame-spitting machinery in faraway Africa , in a setting as dry and lonesome as the moon ? But that is the hallmark of this war . No other war has ever been like it . This war rings the world . Kidney Ridge is everywhere on our small globe . Men fight as far from home as they can be transported , with courage and endurance that makes one proud of the human race , in horrible contrivances that make one ashamed of the human race @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I will dictate a dispatch about what I see here . What I am looking at , right now as the sun touches the horizon , is this . Two intelligence officers , not fifty yards from me , are lifting the German driver out of a blasted tank , using meat hooks . He is black and charred . He has no head . He is a trunk with arms and legs . The smell is like gamy pork . The legs wear good boots , only a bit scorched.  |p507I  am very tired . A voice I do n't want to listen to tells Inc that this is England'slast land triumph ; that our military history ends here with a victory to stand with the greatest , won largely with machines shipped ten thousand miles from American factories . Tommy Atkins will serve with pluck and valor whereverhe fights hereafter , as always ; but the conduct of the war is passing out of our hands . We are outnumbered and outclassed . Modern war is a clangorous and dreary measuring of industrial plants . Germany 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the First World War by sheer grit . Today the two industrial giants of the earth are the United States and the Soviet Union . They more than outmatch Germany and Japan , now that they have shaken off their surprise setbacks and sprung to arms . Tocqueville 's vision is coming to pass in our time . They will divide the empire of the world . The sun going down on Kidney Ridge is setting on the British Empire , on which  --  so we learned to say as schoolboys  --  the sun never set . Our Empire was born in the skill of our explorers , the martial prowess of our yeomanry , the innovative genius of ' our scientists and engineers . We stole a march on the world that lasted two hundred years . Lulled by the long peaceful protection of the great fleet we built , we thought it would last forever . We dozed . Here on Kidney Ridge we have erased the disgrace of our somnolence .

The airplane was humming above the weather now , the sky was bright blue , the sunlight blinding on the white cloud cover . Slote slumped sadly in his chair . He had come a long way from Bern , he was thinking , not only in miles but in perception . In the hothouse of the Swiss capital , under the comfortableglass of neutrality , his obsession about the Jews had sprouted like some forced plant . Now he was coming back to realities . How could one arouse American public opinion ? How get past the horselaugh of " Der Fuehrer 's Face , " the acid cynicism of Fenton ? Above all , how overcome the competition of Kidney Ridge ? Tudsbury 's piece was touchingand evocative , describing a great slaughter ; but there was no Kidney Ridge for the Jews of Europe . They were unarmed . It was no fight . Most of them did not even comprehend that a massacre was going on . Sheep going to the slaughter were uncomfortable to contemplate . One turned one 's eyes elsewhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a contest for the highest stakes , in which the home team was at last pulling ahead . Treblinkahad small chance against Kidney Ridge.  |p509IN  September 1941 , Victor Henry had left a country at peace , but with isolationists and interventionists in a screechy squabble , the production of munitions a trickle , despite all the " arsenal of democracy " rhetoric ; the military services shuddering over Congress 's renewal of the draft by one vote ; a land without rationing , with business booming from defense spending , with lights blazing at night from coast to coast , with the usual cataracts of automobiles on the highways and the city streets . Now as he returned , San Francisco from the air spelled War : shadowy lampless bridges under a full moon , pale ribbons of deserted highways , dimmed-out residential hills , black tall downtown buildings . In the dark quiet streets and in the glare of the hotel lobby the swarms of uniforms astoundedhim . Hitler 's Berlin had looked no more martial . Newspapers and magazines that he read next day on the eastbound flight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bellicose patriotism . Where heroic-looking riveters , miners , or soldiers and their sweetheartswere not featured in the ads , a toothy Jap hyena , or a snake with a Hitler mustache , or a bloated scowling Mussolini-like pig took comic beatings . The news columns and year-end summaries surged with buoyant confidence that at Stalingrad and in North Africa the tide of the war had turned . The Pacific was getting short treatment . Sketchy references to Midway and Guadalcanal , perhaps through the fault of the closemouthed Navy , miserably missed the scope of these battles . As for the sinking of the Northampton , Pug saw that if released the story would have been ignored . This calamity in his life , this loss of a great ship of war , would have been a dark flyspeck on a golden picture of optimism . And it was all mighty sudden ! Island-hopping across the Pacific in recentdays , he had been reading in airplanes and waiting rooms scuffed periodicalsof the past months . With one voice they had bemoaned the dilatory Allied war effort , the deep German advances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ South America , and the Arab lands , and Japan 's march across Burma and the Southwest Pacific . Now with one voice the s.une journalswere hailing the inevitable downfall of Adolf Ilit let and leis partners in crime . This civilian change of mood struck Pug as li ohms . If the strategicp510turn was at hand , the main carnage in the field was yet to come . Americans had only begun to die . To military families , if not to military columnists , this was no small thing . He had called Rhoda from San Francisco , and she had told him that there was no news of Byron . In wartime , no news , especially about a son in submarines , was not necessarily good news . His orders to BuPers and the talk with Spruance were much on his mind as the plane bounced and tossed through the wintry gray skies . The key man at the Bureau for four-striper assignments was Digger Brown , his old Academy chum . Pug had drilled the ambitious Brown , who could n't learn languages , through three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had raised Brown 's class standing and helped his whole career . Pug expected to be ordered back to Cincpac without trouble , for nobody in the Navy swung much more weight right now than Nimitz and Spruance ; still , if there were any bureaucratic shuffling about it , he meant to look Digger Brown in the eye and tell him what he wanted . The man could not refuse him . What about Rhoda ? What could he say in the first moments ? How should he act ? He had been puzzling over this while he flew halfway around the globe , and the quandary was still with him . In the dark marble-tiled foyer of the big Foxhall Road house , she wept in his arms . His bulky bridge coat was flecked with snow , his embrace was awkward , but she clung to him against the cold wet blue cloth and the bumpy brass buttons , exclaiming through sobs , " I 'm sorry , oh , I 'm sorry , Pug . I did n't mean to cry , truly I did n't . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sorry , darling ! Sorry I 'm such a crybaby . " " It 's all right , Rho . Everything 's all right . " And in this first tender moment he really thought everything might turn out all right . Her body felt soft and sweet in his embrace . In all their long marriage he had seen his wife in tears only a few times ; for all her frothy ways she had a streak of stoical self-control . She clutched him like a child seeking comfort , and her wet eyes were large and bright . " Oh , damn , damn , I was going to carry this off with a smile and a martini . The martini is probably still a SCRUMPTIOUS idea , is n't it ? " " At high noon ? Well , maybe , at that . " He tossed his coat and cap on a bench . She led him hand in hand into the living room , where flames leaped in the fireplace , and ornaments glittered on a large Christmas tree that filled the room with a smell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her hands . " Let 's have a good look at you . " " Madeline 's coming here for Christmas , you know , " she chattered , " and not having a maid and all , I thought I 'd just buy a tree early and trim thep511darn thing up , and  --  well , well , SAY something ! " She shakily laughed , freeing her hands . " This captain 's inspection is giving me the WIM-WAMS . What do you think of the old hulk ? " It was almost like sizing up another man 's wife . Rhoda 's skin was soft , clear , scarcely lined . In the clinging jersey dress her figure was as seductive as ever ; if anything , a shade thin . Her hip bones jutted . Her movements and gestures were lithe , fetching , feminine . Her comic waggle of ten spread fingers at him when she said " WIM-WAMS " brought back her roguish charm in their first dates . " You look marvelous . " The admiring tone brought instant radiance to her face . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say that . And you look so smart ! A bit grayer , old thing , but it 's attractive . " He walked to the fire , holding out his hands . " This feels good . " " Oh , I 'm being ever so patriotic . Also practical . Oil 's a problem . I keep the thermostat down , close off most of the rooms , and burn a lot of wood . Now , you WRETCH ! Why did n't you call me from the airport ? I 've been pacingthe house like a LEOPARD . " " The booths were jammed . " " Well , I 've been FALLING on the phone for an hour . It kept ringing . That fellow Slote called from the State Department . He 's back from Swit-zerland . " " Slote ! Any news of Natalie ? Or of Byron ? " " He was in a terrific hurry . He 's going to call again . Natalie seems to be in Lourdes , and  --  " " What ? Lourdes ? France ? How 'd she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interned diplomats and journalists . That 's all he said about her . Byron was in Lisbon , trying to get transportation back , last Slote heard . He 's got orders to new construction . " " Well ! And the baby ? " " Slote did n't say . I asked him to dinner . And do you remember Sime Anderson ? He called , too . The phone never stopped ringing . " " The midshipman ? The one who ran me all over the tennis court while Madeline giggled and clapped ? " " He 's a lieutenant commander ! How about that , Pug ? I declare , these days if you 've been WEANED you 're a lieutenant commander . He wanted Madeline 's phone number in New York . " Staring into the fire , Pug said , " She 's back with that monkey Cleveland , is n't she ? " " Dear , I got to know Mr. Cleveland in Hollywood He 's not a had fiellow . " At her husband 's ugly look she faltered , ' IUesidt ' , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MONEY the child makes ! ' I he firelight was casting harshp512shadows on Victor Henry 's face . She came to him . " Darling , how about that drink ? I 'm frankly all of a QUIVER . " His arm went round her waist , and he kissed her cheek . " Sure . Just let me ring Digger Brown first , and find out why in hell I 'm here on Class One priority . " " Oh , Pug , he 'll only tell you to call the White House . Let 's just pretend your plane 's late and  --  why , what on EARTH is wrong , sweetie ? " " The White House ? " " Well , sure . " She clapped a hand to her lips . " Oh , LORDY . Lucy Brown will have my HEAD . She swore me to secrecy , but I just assumed you knew . " " Knew what ? " His tone changed . He might have been talking to a quartermaster . " Rhoda , tell me exactly what Lucy Brown told you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  it seems the White House ordered BuPers to get you back here , p.d.q . This was early in November , before , well , before you lost the Northampton , Pug . That 's all I know . That 's all even Digger knows . " Pug was at a telephone , dialling . " Go ahead and make that drink . " " Dear , just do n't let on to Digger that Lucy told me . He 'll ROAST her over a slow fire . " The Navy Department switchboard was long in answering . Victor Henry stood alone in the big living room , recovering from his surprise . The White House was still for him , as for any American , a magic expression , but he had come to know the sour aftertaste of serving a President . Franklin Roosevelt had used him like a borrowed pencil , and in the same way had dropped him ; paying off , politician fashion , with the command of the unlucky California . Victor Henry bore the President no grudge . Near or far , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was resolved to fight off , at any cost , further presidential assignments . Those sterile shorebound exercisesas flunky to the great had all but wrecked his professional life . He had to get hack to the Pacific . Digger was out . Pug went over to the fireplace and stood with his back to the blaze . He did not feel at home , yet in Janice 's cramped cottage he had . Why was that ? Before going to Moscow he had spent less than three months in this house . How huge it was ! What had they been thinking of , to buy such a mansion ? Once again he had allowed her to chip in some of her own trust money , because she wanted to live in a style beyond his means . Wrong , wrong . There had been talk of putting up lots of grandchildren . What a bitter memory ! And what were the summer slipcovers doing on the furniture in chill December , in a room smelling of Christmas ? He had never liked this garish flower pattern on green @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his jacket , the chill in the house seemed to pierce to his marrow . Maybe it was true that serving in the tropics thinned the blood . But he could not remember feeling so cold before , on returning from Pacific duty.  |p513  " Martinis , " Rhoda announced , marching in with a clinking tray . " What about Digger ? " " Not there . " The first sip made a fiery streak down Pug 's throat . He had not tasted alcohol in months ; not since a spell of heavy self-numbing after Warren 's death . " Good , " he said , but he regretted agreeing to the martini . He might need all his wits at BuPers . Rhoda offered him a plate of open-face sandwiches , and he commented with assumed heartiness , " Hey , caviar ! Really cosseting me , are n't you ? " " You do n't remember ? " Her smile was archly flirtatious . " You sent it from Moscow . An Army colonel brought me six tins , with this note from you . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoddy Russian paper read . " Martinis , caviar , a fire , AND . . . especially AND . . . ! Love , Pug . " It all came back to him now : the boisterous afternoon when the Harrimanparty had shopped in the one tourist store still functioning , in the NationalHotel , months before Pearl Harbor . Pamela had vetoed all the shawls and blouses ; an elegant woman like Rhoda , she had said , would n't be caught dead in these tacky things . The fur hats had seemed made for giantesses . So he had bought the caviar and scrawled this silly note . " Well , it 's damn good caviar , at that . " Rhoda 's warm glance was inviting a pass . That much , Victor Henry had often pictured : the sea captain home from the wars , Odysseus and Penelope heading for the couch . Her voice was dulcet . " You look as though you have n't slept for days . " " Not all that much . " He put both palms to his eyes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Have n't you ever ! How does the good old U.S.A. look to you , Pug ? " " Peculiar , especially from the air at night . Solid blackout on the WestCoast . Inland you begin to see lights . Peaceful blaze in Chicago . Past Clevelandthey start dimming down again , and Washington 's dark . " " Oh , that 's so typical ! No consistency . This ungodly mess with shortages ! All the talk about rationing ! Off again , on again ! You never know where you 're at . And the HOARDING that 's going on , Pug . Why , people BOAST about how clever they 've been , piling up tires , and meat , and sugar , and heating oil , and I do n't know what all . I tell you , we 're a nation of spoiledHOGS . " " Rhoda , it 's a good idea not to expect too much of human nature . " The remark cut his wife short . A doubtful look , a silent inonu'nt . She put her hand on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alxnrt the . ' ortlramp-ton ? " We got torpedoed and sank . "  |p514  " Lucy says most of the officers and crew were saved . " " Jim Grigg did a good job . Still , we lost too many men . " " Did you have a close call yourself ? " Her face was eager , expectant . In lieu of some affectionate move , for which he felt no impulse , he began to talk about the loss of his ship . He rose and paced , the words running free after a while , the emotions of the terrible night reviving . Rhoda listened shiny-eyed . When the telephone rang he halted in his tracks , staring like a wakened sleepwalker . " I guess that 's Digger . " Captain Brown boomed heartily , " Well , well , Pug . Made it , did you ? Great . " " Digger , did you get a dispatch from Cinepac about me ? " " Look , let 's not do any business over the phone , Pug . Why do n't you and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's been a long time , and so on and so forth . Heh heh ! We 'll talk tomorrow . Give me a ring about nine in the morning . " " Are you tied up today ? Suppose I come down right now ? " " Well , if that 's what you want . " Pug heard his old friend sigh . " But you do sound tired . " " I 'm coming , Digger . " Pug hung up , strode to his wife , and kissed her cheek . " I 'd better find out what 's doing . " " Okay . " She cupped his face in her hands , and gave his mouth a lingeringkiss . " Take the Oldsmobile . " " It still runs ? Fine . " " Maybe you 'll get to be the President 's naval aide . That 's Lucy 's guess . Then at least we 'd see something of each other for a while , Pug . " She walked to a little desk and took out car keys . The unselfconscious pathos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the flirting . Alone in a cold house , bereaved of her firstborn son  --  whom they still had n't mentioned , whose picture smiled from the piano top ; her husband home after more than a year away , rushing out about his business ; she was being very good about all this . This sway of her slender hips was beguiling . Pug wondered at his own lack of desire for her . He had an impulse to throw off the bridge coat he was donning , and to seize her . But Digger Brown was expecting him , and she was dropping the keys into his hand with an arch little flip . " Anyway , we 'll dine at home , wo n't we ? Just the two of us ? " " Sure we 'll dine at home , just the two of us . With wine , I trust , and  --  " he hesitated , then forced a ribald lift of the eyebrows , " especially anrl . " The flash in her eyes leaped across the gulf between them . " On your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same old Navy Building , the long dismal " temporary ' . structure from the last war still disfiguring Constitution Avenue , but inside itp515had a new air : a hurrying pace , a general buzz , crowds of Waves and callowlookingstaff officers in the corridors . Lurid combat paintings that hardly seemed dry hung on the dusty walls : dogfights over carriers , night gun battles , bombardments of tropic islands . During most of Pug 's career , the decor had been mementos of the Spanish-American War , and of Atlantic actionin 1918 . Digger Brown looked every hit the king of the hill that he was : tall , massive , healthy , with a thatch of grizzled hair , with a year of battleship command under his belt ( Atlantic service , but good enough ) , and now this top post in BuPers . Digger had flag rank in the bag . Pug wondered how he must seem to Brown . He had never been overawed by his fast-moving old friend , nor was he now . Much passed unspoken as they shook hands and scanned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Henry made Captain Brown think of an oak tree in his own hack yard , blasted by lightning yet still vigorous , and putting forth green shoots each spring from charred branches . " That 's hell about Warren , " Brown said . Henry made an elaborate business of lighting a cigarette . Brown had to get the rest spoken . " And the California , and then the Northampton . Christ ! " He gripped Pug 's shoulder in awkward sympathy . " Sit you down . " Pug said , " Well , sometimes I tell myself I did n't volunteer to be born , Digger , I got drafted . I 'm all right . " " And Rhoda ? How 'd you find her ? " " Splendid . " " What about Byron ? " " Coming back from Gib to new construction , or so I hear . " Pug cocked his head at his old friend , squinting through smoke . " You 're riding high . " " I 've yet to hear a gun go off in anger . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Pug , it may be a reprehensible sentiment , but I hope you 're right . " Captain Brown put on horn-rimmed glasses , thumbed through dispatches on a clipboard , and handed one to Pug . " You asked me about this , I believe ? " FROM : CINCPACTO : RUPERSDESIRE ASSIGNMENT STAFF DUTY THIS COMMAND VICTOR ( NONE ) HENRY CAPTAIN USN SERIAL 4329 EX CO NORTHAMPTON X NIMITZPug nodded . Brown unwrapped a stick of chewing gum . " I 'm supposed to quit smoking . Blood pressure . It 's got me climbing the walls . " " Come on , Digger , are my orders to Cincpac set ? " " Pug , did you wangle this on the trip home ? " " I did n't wangle it . Spruance sprang it uu nu  --  . I was amazed . I thought I 'd catch hell lirr losing my ship . "  |p516  " Why ? You went down fighting .

" " Why do you suppose you were recalled with Class One air priority ? " " You tell me . " Slowly , with a portentous air , Brown said , " The . . . Great . . . White . . . Father . " Then more lightly , " Yessir ! The boss man himself You 're supposedto report in to him soonest , in full feathers and war paint . " Brown laughed at his own humor . " What 's it about ? " " Oh , blast , give me a butt . Thanks . " Brown dragged at the cigarette , his eyes popping . " You know Admiral Standley , I believe . The ambassador to Russia , that is . " " Sure . I went there with him last year on the Harriman mission . " " Exactly . He 's back for consultations with the President . Even before the Northampton was lost , Rear Admiral Carton was telephoning us from the White House in a big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Hence the Class One priority . " Pug said , trying to keep the irritation out of his voice , " Nimitz should draw more water around here than Standley does . " " Pug , I have my instructions . You 're to call Russ Carton for an appointment to see the President . " " Does Carton know about the Cincpac dispatch ? " " I have n't told him . " " Why not ? " " I was n't asked . " " Okay , Digger . I 'm asking you to notify Russ Carton about that Cincpac dispatch . Today . " A brief contest of cold stares . With a deep drag on the cigarette , Digger Brown said , " You 're asking me to get out of line . " " Why ? You 're derelict in not telling the White House Cincpac wants me . " Christ on a bicycle , Pug , do n't give me that . When that man up on Pennsylvania Avenue snaps his fingers , we jump around here . Nothing else signifies . " " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you say . " " I 'm not sure . Tell Russ Carton about Cincpac yourself when you see him . " " N.G. He must get the word from BuPers . " Captain Brown sullenly avoided his eyes . " Who says he must ? " Victor Henry intoned as in a language drill , " Ich muss , du muss ' , IT m u.s , s.  --   |p517An  unhappy grin curled Brown 's mouth and he picked up the chant , " Wir miissen , ihr rniisst , sie miisst . " " Miissen , Digger . " " Miissen . I never could hack German , could I ? " Brown pulled deeply on the cigarette and abruptly ground it out . " God , that tasted good . Pug , I still think you should find out first what the Great White Father wants . " He hit a buzzer in an annoyed gesture . " But have it your way . I 'll shoot a copy to Russ . " The house was warmer . Pug heard a man talking in the living room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loud . " Oh , hi ! " Rhoda 's cheery voice . " Back so soon ? " A deeply tanned young officer was on his feet when Pug walked in . The mustache puzzled him , then he put together the blond hair and the bright new gold half-stripe of a lieutenant commander . " Hello there , Anderson . " Pouring tea at a table by the fire , Rhoda said , " Sime just stopped by to drop off Maddy 's Christmas present . " " Something I picked up in Trinidad . " Anderson gestured at the gaily wrapped box on the table . " What were you doing in Trinidad ? " Rhoda gave the men tea and left , while Anderson was telling Pug about his destroyer duty in the Caribbean . U-boats had been having fat pickings off Venezuela and the Guianas , and in the Gulf of Mexico : oil tankers , bauxite carriers , freighters , and passenger liners . Emboldened by the easy pickings , the German skippers had even taken to surfacing and sinking ships with gunfire , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had now worked up a combined convoy system to control the menace , and Anderson had been out on that convoy duty . Pug was only vaguely aware of the Caribbean U-boat problem . Anderson 's tale made him think of two large photographs in the Navy Building , showing Eskimos bundled in furs watching the loading of a Catalina flying boat in a snowstorm , and Polynesians naked but for G-strings staring at an identical Catalina moored in a palm-fringed lagoon . This war was a leprosyspreading all over the globe . " Say , Anderson , were n't you working with Deak Parsons at BuOrd on the AA proximity fuse , advanced hush-hush stuff ? " " Yes , sir . " " Then why the Sam Hill were you shipped off to the Caribbean on an old four-piper ? " " Shortage of deck officers , sir . " " That fuse is fantastic , Sime . " The bright blue eyes glowed in the brown faay . " Oh , huts it gotten out to the fleet ? '  |p518  " I saw a demonstration off Noumea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three drones splashed in minutes . Downright spooky , those AA bursts opening up right by the planes every time . " " We worked pretty hard on it . " " How the devil did Deak Parsons get a whole radio signal set inside an AA shell ? And how does it survive a jolt of muzzle velocity , and a spin in trajectoryof five hundred times a second ? " " Well , sir , we figured out the specs . The industry fellows said , Can do , ' and they did it . As a matter of fact , I 'm going down to Anacostia now to see Captain Parsons . " Victor Henry had never liked any of Madeline 's gosling suitors , but this one looked pretty good to him , especially by contrast with Hugh Cleveland . " Any chance you can come and have Christmas dinner with us ? Madeline will be here . " " Yes , sir . Thank you . Mrs. Henry 's been kind enough to invite me . " " She has ? Well ! Give Deak my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " In the stuffy office of the Naval Research Laboratory , looking out over the mud flats to the river , Captain William Parsons complimented Anderson on his suntan , and nodded without comment at Pug Henry 's message . He was a man in his forties with a wrinkled pale brow and receding hair , run-ofl the-mill in appearance but the most hardworking and brilliant man Anderson had ever served under . " Sime , what do you know about uranium ? " Anderson felt as though he had stepped on a third rail . " I 've done no work in radioactivity , sir . Nor in neutron bombardment . " " You do know that there 's something funny going on in uranium . " " Well , when I did my postgrad work at Cal Tech in 1939 , there was a lot of talk about the fission results of the Germans . " " What sort of talk ? " " Wild talk , Captain , about superbombs , also about atomic-powered propulsion , all very theoretical . " " D' you suppose we 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Just a promising freak of nature ? With all the German scientists working around the clock for Hitler ? " " I hope not , sir . " " Come with me . " They went outside and hurried with heads down toward the main laboratorybuilding , through a bitter wind blowing from the river . Even at a distance , an eerie hissing and whistling sounded from the lab . Inside , the noise was close to deafening . Steam was escaping from a forest of freestanding slender pipes reaching almost to the very high roof , giving the place thep519dank warmth of the Caribbean . Men in shirt-sleeves or coveralls were potteringat the pipes or at instrument panels . " Thermal diffusion , " Parsons shouted , " for separating U-235 . Did you know Phil Abelson at Cal Tech ? " Parsons pointed to a slender man in shirtsleevesand tie , about Anderson 's age , standing arms akimbo at a wall covered with dials . " No , but I heard about him . " " Come and meet him . He 's working with us in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keen look when Parsons explained over the noise that Anderson had worked on the proximity fuse . " We 've got a chemical engineering problem here , " Abelson said , gesturing around at the pipes . " That your field ? " " Not exactly . Out of uniform I 'm a physicist . " Abelson briefly smiled and turned back to his instrument panel . " I just wanted you to see this setup , " Parsons said . " Let 's get out of here . " The air outside seemed arctic . Parsons buttoned his bridge coat to his chin , jammed his hands in his pockets , and strode toward the river , where nests of gray Navy ships rode to anchor . " Sime , you know the principle of the Clusius tube , do n't you ? " Anderson searched his memory . " That 's the lab tube with the doughnut-shaped cross-section ? " " Yes . That 's what Abelson 's got in there . Two pipes one inside the other , actually . You heat the inside pipe and chill the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the space between , the molecules of any lighter isotope will move toward the heat . Convection takes them to the top , and you skim them off . Abelson 's put together a lot of giant Clusius tubes , a whole jungle of them in series . The U-235 gradually cooks out . It 's damned slow , but he 's already got measurable enrichment . " " What 's his liquid ? " " That 's his original achievement . Uranium hexafluoride . He developed the stuff and it 's pretty touchy , but stable enough to work with . Now , this thing is getting pretty hot , and BuOrd wants to station a line officer here . I 've recommended you . It 's a shore billet again . You young fellows can always get sea duty if you prefer . " But Sime Anderson had no seafaring ambitions . He had gone to the Academy to get a superior free education .

Among Navy men the talk was of the ultimate submarine ; power without the combustion that needed air . This was a grand frontier of applied human intelligence . A more mundane inducement occurred to young Anderson . Stationed in Anacostia , he could see a lot more of Madeline Henry than he had been doing . " Sir , if the Bureau considers me qualified , I 've no objection . " " Okay . Now what I 'm going to tell you next , Anderson , blows away on the wind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that fenced off a rocky drop to the river . " As I said , our interest is propulsion , but the Army 's working on a bomb . We 're excluded . Compartmentalized secrecy . Still , we know . " Parsons glanced at the younger man , hurrying his words . " Our first objective and the Army 's are the same , to produce pure U-235 . For them the next step is making a weapon . A battery of theoreticians is already working on that . Maybe some fact of nature will prevent it . Nobody can say for sure yet . " " Does the Army know what we 're doing ? " " Hell , yes . We gave them their uranium hexafluoride to start with . But the Army thinks thermal diffusion is for the birds . Too slow , and the enrichmentis too low-grade . Their assignment is to beat Hitler to a bomb . A prudent notion , that . They 're starting from the ground up , with untried designs and new concepts that are supposed to be shortcuts , and they 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavyweights like Lawrence , Compton , and Fermi have been supplying the ideas . The size of the Army effort really staggers the mind , Anderson . They 're commandeering power , water , land , and strategic materials till hell wo n't have it . Meantime we 've got enriched U-235 in hand . Low enrichment , not bomb material as yet , but a first stage . The Army 's got a lot of big ideas and big holes in the ground . Now if the Army falls on its face it 'll be the biggest scientific and military bust of all time . And then  --  just conceivably , mind you  --  then it could he up to the Navy to heat the Germans to atomic bombs , right here in Anacostia . " " Wow . " Parsons wryly grinned . " Do n't hold your breath . The Army 's got the President 's ear , and the world 's greatest minds working on it , and they 're outspending us a million dollars to one . They 'll probably make a bomb , if nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 'll keep our little tinpot operation cooking . Just keep the other remote contingencyin your mind , and pick up your orders at BuPers tomorrow . " " Aye aye , sir . " By candlelight Rhoda 's face was like a young woman 's . As they ate cherry tarts she had baked for dessert , Pug was telling her , through a li ) , g of '  |p521fatigue  , about his stop in Noumea on his way home . They were on their third bottle of wine , so his description of the somnolent French colony south of the equator , overrun by the carnival of American war-making , was not very coherent . He was trying to describe the comic scene in the officers ' club in an old fusty French hotel , of men in uniform clustering four and five deep around a few Navy nurses and Frenchwomen , captains and commanders up close , junior officers hovering on the outer edges just to stare at the females . Pug was so weary that Rhoda 's face seemed to be blurrily wavering between the candle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hesitantly , " I 'm afraid you 're not making very good sense . " " What ? Why not ? " " You just said you and Warren were watching all this , and Warren cracked a joke  --  " Pug shuddered . He had indeed been drifting into a doze while he talked , fusing dreams with memory , picturing Warren alive in that jammed smoky Noumea club long after Midway , holding a can of beer in his old way , and saying , " Those gals are forgetting , Dad , that once the uniform comes off , the more stripes , the less action . " It was pure fantasy ; in his lifetime Warren had never come to Noumea . " I 'm sorry . " He vigorously shook his head . " Let 's skip the coffee "  --  she looked concerned  --  " and put you to bed . " " Hell , no . I want my coffee . And brandy , too . I 'm enjoying myself , Rhoda . " " Probably the fire 's making you sleepy . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The carved wooden mantelpiece of this large dining room , in the flicker of light and shadow from the log fire , was oppressively elegant . Pug had grown unused to Rhoda 's style of life , which had always been too rich for him . He stood up , feeling the wine in his head and in his knees . " Probably . I 'll take the Chambertin inside . You deploy the coffee . " " Dear , I 'll bring you the wine , too . " He dropped in a chair in the living room , by the fireplace heaped with gray ashes . The bright chandelier gave the trimmed Christmas tree a tawdry store-window look . It was warm all through the house now , and there was a smell of hot dusty radiators . She had put up the thermostat with the comment , " I 've gotten used to a cool house . No wonder the British think we steam ourselves alive like SEAFOOD . But of course you 've just come up from the tropics . " Pug wondered at his macabre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have invented that wisecrack ? The voice had been SO recognizable , so alive ! " Once the uniform comes off , Dad , the more stripes , thep522less action ! " Pure Warren ; neither he himself nor Byron would ever have said that . Rhoda set the bottle and glass at his elbow . " Coffee will he right along , honey . " Sipping at the wine , he felt he could fall into bed and sleep fourteen hours without moving . But Rhoda had gone to so much trouble , and the dinnerhad been so good : onion soup , rare roast beef , baked potatoes with sour cream , an gratin cauliflower ; her new form-fitting red silk dress was a stunner , her hair was done up as for a dance , her whole manner was loving and willing . Penelope was more than ready for the returned wayfarer , and Pug did n't want to disappoint or humiliate his wife . Yet whether because he was aging , or weary , or because the Kirby business lay raw and unresolved , he sensed no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touch on his face , and he opened his eyes to see her smiling down at him . " I do n't think coffee 'll help much , Pug . " " No . Most discouraging . " Getting ready for bed half-woke him . Coming from the bathroom , he found her , fully dressed , turning down his twin bed . He felt like a fool . He tried to embrace her . She fended him off with the laughing deftness of a coed . " Sweetie pie , I love you to little pieces , but I truly do n't believe you 'd make it . One good night 's sleep , and the tiger will be back on the prowl . " Pug sank into bed with a sleepy groan . Softly she kissed him on the mouth . " It 's good to have you back . " " Sorry about this , " he murmured , as she turned out the light . Not in the least put out , rather relieved than otherwise , Rhoda took off the red dress and donned an old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the dinner , and of the day gone by ; emptied the living room ashtrays , shovelled the fireplace ashes into a scuttle , laid a new fire for the morning , and put out the ashes and the garbage . She enjoyed the moment 's breath of icy air in the alley , the glimpse of glittering stars , and the crunch of snow under her slippers . In her dressing room , with a glass of brandy at hand , she ran a hot bathand set about the dismantling job under glaring lights between large mirrors . Off came the rouge , the lipstick , the mascara , and the skin makeup whichshe wore down to her collar bone . The naked woman stepping into the vaporoustub was lean , almost stringy , after months of resolute starving . Herribs unattractively showed ; but her belly was straight , her hips slim , herbreasts small and passably shaped . About the face , alas , there was nothinggirlish . Still , Colonel Harrison Peters , she thought , would find her desirable . To Rhoda 's view desirability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the woman 's job was to foster the feeling , if . she detected it and if itsuited her purpose . Pug liked her thin , so she had danined well gotten thinp523for this reunion . Rhoda knew she was in trouble , but about her sexual allure for her husband she was not worried . Given Pug 's dour fidelity , this was the rock on which their marriage stood . The warm water enveloped and deliciously relaxed her . Despite her outer calm she had been taut as a scared cat all evening . In his gentleness , his absence of reproach , his courteous manner , and his lack of ardor , Pug had said it all . His silences disclosed more than other men 's words . No doubt he had forgiven her ( whatever that might mean ) but he had not even begun to forget ; though it seemed he was not going to bring up the anonymous letters . Adding it all up , she was not unhappy with this first day . It was over , and they were off the knife-edge , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encounter in bed . It could so easily have gone wrong , and a few silly minutes might have exacerbated the estrangement . Sex as pleasure , at this point , mattered to her not at all . She had more serious concerns . Rhoda was a woman of method , much given to lists , written and mental . The bath was her time for review . Item one tonight was nothing less than her marriage itself . Despite Pug 's kind letters , and the wave of reconciling emotion after Warren 's death  --  now that they had faced each other , was it salvageable ? On the whole , she thought so . This had immediate practical consequences . Colonel Harrison Peters was amazingly taken with her . He was coming to Saint John 's Church on Sundays just to see more of her . At first she had wondered what he wanted of her , when ( so she had heard ) plenty of roundheeledWashington girls were his at a push . Now she knew , because he had told her . She was the military man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decorous , churchgoing , elegant , and brave . He admired the way she was bearing the loss of her son . In their moments together  --  she was keepingthem infrequent and public , having learned her lesson with Kirby  --  he had gotten her to talk about Warren , and sometimes had wiped away his own tears . The man was tough and important , doing some highly secret Army job ; but when it came down to cases , he was just a lonesome bachelor in his mid-fifties , tired of fooling around , too old to start a family , but wistful to settle down . There the man was for the having . But if she could hold on to Pug , that was what she wanted . He was her life . She had worked out with Palmer Kirby her romantic yearnings . Divorce and remarriage were messy at best . Her identity , her prestige , her selfrespect , were bound up with remaining Mrs. Victor Henry . Moving to Hawaiihad proven too difficult and complicated ; but maybe it was just as well that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wounds had somewhathealed . Pug was a real man . You could never count Pug Henry out . Why , here was the White House calling him again ! He had had a rotten run ol ' hick , including her own misconduct ; but if ever a man had the stuff top524weather it , he did . In her way Rhoda admired and even loved Pug . The death of Warren had enlarged her limited capacity for love . A broken heart sometimes stretches when it mends . The way Rhoda now sized matters up , soaking in her tub , it appeared that after a touch-and-go reconciliation they would make it . After all , there was the Pamela Tudsbury business ; she had something to forgive too , though she did not know just what . When they had talked of Tudsbury 's death at dinner she had carefully watched Pug 's face . " I wonder what Pamela will do now , " she had ventured . " I saw them when they passed through Hollywood , you know . Did you get my letter ? The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " I know . You sent me the speech . " " Actually , Pug , she wrote it . So she told me . " " Yes , Pam was ghosting a lot for him toward the end . But he gave her the ideas . " No surprising the old fox , tired or not ; his tone was perfectly casual . Not that it mattered . Rhoda had digested Pamela Tudsbury 's astounding revelation in Hollywood more or less in this wise : if a passionate young beauty like that one  --  who by the look of her knew plenty about men  --  could not snag Pug right after poor Warren 's death , when he was far from home , vulnerable , estranged by the Kirby affair , and no doubt drunk every night , then the marriage was probably safe . Colonel Harrison Peters , all handsome six feet three of him , could go hang if she could keep Pug . Harrison'sadmiration was like an accident insurance policy . She was glad she had it , and hoped she would never have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bedroom nightlight , the grim lines of Pug 's face were smoothed by sleep . An unwonted impulse came to Rhoda 's mind : should she slip into his bed ? She had seldom done this down the years ; mostly a long time ago , after too much to drink or an evening of flirting with someone else 's husband . Pug took her rare advances as great compliments . He looked handsome and sweet . Many a breach between them had quickly closed with lovemaking . Yet she hesitated . It was one thing for the modest spouse to yield to a yen for her man back from the war . For her  --  on probation , seeking forgiveness  --  was n't it something else ; a bribing use of her body , a hint of coarsened appetite ? None of this was articulated by Rhoda , naturally . It raced through her mind in a sort of female symbolic logic , and she got into her own bed . Pug snapped awake , the alcohol wearing off and his nerves jangling an alarm . Rhoda , dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair . No use turning over . He would have to drink more or take a pill . He found the warmest bathrobe in his closet , and went to the library where the movablep525bar was . On the antique desk lay a big leather-bound scrapbook , with Warren'sphotograph worked into the cover over gold-stamped lettering : Lieutenant Warren Henry , USNHe mixed a stiff bourbon and water , staring at the album as at a spectre . He walked out of the room , snapping off the light ; then he went back , groped to the desk , and lit the reading lamp . Standing drink in hand , he went through the scrapbook leaf by leaf On the inside front cover , bordered in black , was Warren 's baby picture ; on the inside back cover , his obituary in the Washington Post , with a blurry photograph ; and facing this , the citation for his posthumous Navy Cross , boldly signed in black ink by the Secretary of the Navy . In this album Rhoda had marshalled their firstborn son 's whole short life : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ red and green crayon on coarse kindergarten paper ; the first report card in Grade One of a school in Norfolk  --  Effort A , Work A+ , Conduct C ; pictures of children 's birthday parties , pictures at summer camps , honor certificates , athletic citations , programs of school plays , track meets , and graduations ; sample letters , with penmanship and language improving from year to year ; Academy documents and photographs , his commission , promotion letters , and transfer dispatches , interspersed with snapshots of him on ships and in the cockpits of airplanes ; half a dozen pages devoted to pictures and mementosof his engagement and marriage to Janice Lacouture ( an unexpected photograph of Natalie Jastrow in a black dress , standing beside the whitecladmarried pair in the sun , gave Pug a turn ) ; and the last pages were full of war souvenirs  --  his squadron posing on the deck of the Enterprise , Warren in his cockpit on deck and in the air , a jocular cartoon of him in the ship 's newspaper reporting his lecture on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , also bordered in black , his last letter to his mother , typed on Enterprise stationery . It was dated in March , three months before his death . Shaken at finding these fresh words from his dead son , Pug avidly read them . Warren had always hated to write letters . He had filled the first page by recounting Vic 's bright doings and sayings , and housekeeping problems in Hawaii . On the second page he had warmed up : I fly dawn patrol , so I had better sign off , Mom . Sorry I have n't written more often . I usually manage to see Dad when we 're in port . I assume he keeps you up to date . Also I ca n't write much about what I do . But III say this . Every time I take off over the water , and every time I come in Ihr a deck landing , I thank my stars that I made it through Pensacola There are just a handful of naval aviators in this war . When Vic gross s up .11111p526reads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old crock he calls Dad , I do n't think he 'll be ashamed of the part I played . I certainly hope that by the time Vic 's a man the world will be getting rid of war . This exercise used to be fun , and maybe even profitable for the victor , I do n't know . But mine 's the last generation that can get a kick out of combat , Mom , it 's all getting too impersonal , and complicated , and costly , and deadly . People have to figure out a saner way to run this planet . Armed robbers like the Germans and the laps create problems , but hereafter they 'll have to be snuffed out before they get rolling . So I almost hate to confess how much fun it 's been . I hope my son never knows the fear and the glory of diving a plane into AA fire . It 's a hell of a stupid way to make a living . But now that I 'm doing it , I have to tell you I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'd like to see Vic become a politician and work at straightening the world out . I may even have a shot at it myself when all this is over , and cut a trail for him . Meantime , dawn patrol . Love , WarrenPug closed the album , tossed off his second drink , and passed his hand over the rough leather as over the cheek of a child . Turning off the lights , he trudged upstairs to the bedroom . Warren 's mother was asleep as before , on her back , the pretty profile cut off by the grotesque hair bag . He stared at her as though she were a stranger . How could she have endured putting that album together ? It was a wonderful job , like everything she did . He could not yet trust himself to speak his son 's name aloud , and she had done all that : dug up the mementos , faced them , handled them , made a nice ornamental arrangement of them . Pug got into bed , face buried in the pillow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few more hours of oblivion.  |p527THE  broad gold admiral 's stripe on Russell Carton 's sleeve was very shiny . His overheated little office in the west wing of the White House was crusted with many paint jobs , the latest oyster gray . This newly minted rear admiral was only two Academy classes senior to Pug . The face was jowlier , the body thicker than in the days when Carton had marched by on the Annapolis parade ground shouting orders to his battalion . He had been stiff then and he was stiff now . Seated at a metal desk under a large autographedpicture of the President , he shook hands without rising , and made pointless chitchat , not mentioning the Nimitz request . So Pug decided to risk a probe . " Admiral , did BuPers notify you of a dispatch from Cincpac about me ? " " Well , yes . " Guarded and grudging answer . " Then the President knows that Admiral Nimitz wants me for his staff ? " " Henry , my advice to you is simply to go in there and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Admiral Standley is with the President now . Also Mr. Hopkins and Admiral Leahy . " He pulled a basket of correspondenceforward . " Now until we 're buzzed , I do have these letters to get out . " Pug had his answer ; the President did not know . The wait went by without another word from Carton while Pug reviewed his situation and planned his tactics . In over a year he had received no comment on his battlefront report to Harry Hopkins from Moscow , nor a reply to his letter to the President about the evidence of a Jewish massacre in Minsk . He had long since concluded that that letter had finished him with the White House , showing him up as a sentimental meddler in matters not his concern . That had not bothered him much . He had never sought the role of a minor presidential emissary , and had not relished it . Evidently old Admiral Standleywas behind this White House summons . The countering tactic must be simple : disclose the Nimitz dispatch to nullify Standley , pull out and stay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ return to the Pacific . The buzzer sounded twice . " That 's us , " said Carton . The White House hallways and stairways appeared quiet and unchanged , the calm at the eye of the hurricane . Secretaries and uniformed orderlies moved softly at a peacetimepace . In the Oval Office the gadgets and ship models cluttering the bigp528desk did not seem to have been moved in nearly two years . But Franklin Roosevelt was much altered : the gray hair thinner , the eyes filmy in purple pouches , the whole aspect strikingly aged . Harry Hopkins , slouching waxenfacedin an armchair , wearily waved at Pug . The two admirals emblazoned with gold and ribbons , sitting rigidly on a couch , barely glanced at him . Roosevelt 's tired big-jawed face took on lively pleasure as Victor Henry came in with Carton . " Well , Pug , old top ! " The voice was rich , lordly , Harvardish , like all the boring radio comedians ' imitations . " So the Japs made you swim for it , eh ? " " I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my favorite exercise , you know , swimming , " Roosevelt said with a waggish grin . " It 's good for my health . However , I like to pick my own time and place . " Nonplussed for a moment , Pug realized that the heavy pleasantry was intended as a kindness . Roosevelt 's eyebrows were expectantly raised for his answer . He forced the lightest riposte he could think of " Mr. President , I agree it was an ill-timed swim , but it was pretty good for my own health . " " Ha , ha ! " Roosevelt threw back his head and laughed with gusto , whereupon the others also laughed a little . " Well put ! Otherwise you would n't be here , would you ? " He delivered this as though it were another joke , and the others laughed again . Russell Carton withdrew . The President'sexpressive face went grave . " Pug , I regret the loss of that grand ship , and of all those brave men . The Northampton gave a bully account of herself , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safe . You must know Admiral Leahy "  --  Roosevelt 's lean , dry-looking chief of staff gave Pug a wooden nod suited to his four stripes and sunken ship  --  " and of course Bill Standley . Bill 's been singing your praises ever since you went with him to Moscow . " Hello , Henry , " said Admiral Standley . Leathery , wizened , a bulky hearingaid in his ear , his thin lipless lower jaw thrust out over a corded , wattled neck , he looked a bit like an angry tortoise . " You know , Admiral Standley grew so fond of the Russians on that Harrimanmission , Pug "  --  Roosevelt signalled another joke with arched eyebrows  --  " that I had to send him back to Moscow as ambassador , just to keep him happy ! And though he 's been home on leave , he misses them so much he 's hurrying back there tomorrow . Right , Bill ? " " Right as rain , Chief " The tone was coarsely sarcastic . " How did you like the Russians , Pug @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President . " " Oh ? Well , other people occasionally have been , too . What impressed you most about them ? " " Their numbers , sir , and their willingness to die . " Glances darted among the four men . I larn I Iopkins spoke op in a weakp529hoarse voice , " Well , Pug , I guess at this point the Germans at Stalingrad might agree with you . " Standley gave Pug a peevish look . " The Russians are numerous and brave . Nobody disputes that . They 're also impossible . That 's the basic problem , and there 's a basic answer . Firmness and clarity . " Standley waved a bony finger at the tolerantly smiling President . " Words are wasted on them . It 's like dealing with beings from another planet . They understand only the language of deeds . Even that they can get wrong . I do n't think they understandLend-Lease to this minute . It 's available , so they simply demand and demand , and grab and grab , like kids at a party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cocking his head , the President almost gaily replied , " Bill , did I ever tell you about my talk with Litvinov , way back in 1933 ? I was negotiating recognition of the Soviet Union with him . Well , I 'd never dealt with such people before . Gracious , I got mad ! It was over the issue of religious freedomfor our nationals in Russia , as I recall . He was being slippery as an eel . I simply blew up at him . I 've never forgotten his comeback , as cool as you please . " He said , Mr. President , right after our revolution , your people and mine could hardly communicate . You were still one hundred percent capitalistic , and we had dropped to zero . ' " Roosevelt spread his meaty hands verticallyin the air , far apart . " Since then we 've come up to here , to about twenty , and you 've come down to about eighty . In the years to come I believe we 'll narrow it to sixty and forty . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not get any closer , ' he said , but across that gap we 'll communicatequite well . ' Now Bill , I see Litvinov 's words coming true in this war . " So do I , " said Hopkins . Standley fairly snapped at Hopkins , " You fellows do n't stay long . Their company manners are fine with you vodka visitors . Working with them day to day is something else . Now , Mr. President , I know my time 's up . Let me summarize , and I 'll take my leave . " He ticked off brisk pleas for stricter administration of Lend-Lease , for promotion of his attaches , and for direct control by the embassy of visiting VIPs . He mentioned Wendell Willkie with special abhorrence , and shot Hopkins a sour look . Nodding , smiling , Roosevelt promised Standley that it would all be done . As the two admirals went out , Standley gave Pug a pat on the shoulder and a crabbed grin . Sighing , the President pressed a button . " Let 's have some lunch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my wife just gave me a late breakfast of fresh trout . " " You do n't say ! Trout ! Well , I call that a nice welcome ! How is Rhoda ? Such an elegant and pretty woman . " " She 's well , Mr. President . She hoped you 'd remember her . "  |p530  " Oh , she 's hard to forget . " Taking off his pince-nez and rubbing his purple-rimmed eyes , Franklin Roosevelt said , " Pug , when I heard from SecNavabout your boy , Warren , I felt terrible . That 's the one I never met . Is Rhoda hearing up ? " The old politician 's trick of remembering first names , and the sudden reference to his dead son , threw Pug off balance . " She 's fine , sir . " " That was a remarkable victory at Midway , Pug . It was all due to brave youngsters like Warren . They saved our situation in the Pacific . " The Presidentabruptly changed his tone and manner from the warmest sympathy to straight business . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many warships around Guadalcanal in night actions . Have n't we ? How is that ? Are the Japs better night fighters than we are ? " " No , sir ! " Pug felt the question as a personal jab . Glad to get off the subject of Warren , he answered crisply , " They started the war at a much higher level of training . They were geared up and ready to go . We were n't . Even so , we 've stood them off They 've given up trying to reinforce Guadalcanal . We 're going to win there . I admit we have to do better in night gun battles , and we will . " " I agree with all you say . " The President 's look was cold and penetrating . " But I was terribly worried for a while there , Pug . I thought we might have to pull out of Guadalcanal . Our people would have taken that very hard . The Australians would simply have panicked . Nimitz did just the right thing , putting Halsey in there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President was fitting a cigarette into his holder . " He 's done splendidly on a shoestring . Rescued the whole picture there . One operational carrier ! Imagine ! We 'll not be in that fix much longer , our production is starting to roll . It 's taken a year longer than it should have , Pug . But just as you say , they were plotting war , and I was n't ! No matter what some newspapers keep hinting . Ah , here we are . " The white-coated Negro steward wheeled in a servidor . Putting aside the cigarette holder , Roosevelt startled Pug by complaining , " Just look at this portion , will you ? Three eggs , maybe four . Darn it all , Pug , you 're going to have to divide this with me . Serve it for two ! " he ordered the steward . " Go ahead and have your soup , Harry . Do n't wait . " The steward , looking scared , slid out a shelf from a corner of the desk , pulled up a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and coffee , while Hopkins listlessly spooned soup from a bowl on a tray in his lap . " This is more like it , " said Franklin Roosevelt , eagerly starting to cat . " Now you can tell your grandchildren , Pug , that you shared a Presidential lunch . And maybe the staff will get the idea , once for all , that I do n't like wasteful portions . It 's a constant battle . " The loose lukewarm eggs lacked salt and pepper . Pug ate them down , feeling historically privileged if ' not at all hungry.  |p531  " Say , Pug , " said Hopkins in a faded voice , " we ran into a heck of a shortage of landing craft for North Africa . There was talk of a crash program to turn them out , and your name came up . But now the invasion 's a success , and the U-boat problem has gotten more acute . So destroyer escorts are the number one shipyard priority . Nevertheless , the landing craft problem wo n't go away , so  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , dropping his fork with a clunk . " It haunts every discussion of the invasion of France . I remember our talks way hack in August ' 41 , Pug , aboard the Augusta before I went to meet Churchill . You knew your stuff One forceful man riding herd on the landing craft program for the Navy , with my full backing , is what I need . But here old Bill Standley has come along , quite by coincidence , and asked for you as a special military aide . " Roosevelt glanced up over the rim of his coffee cup . " Do you have a preference ? " After weeks of wondering , here was a tumble of revelations for Victor Henry . So they had whisked him back from the Pacific to put him into landingcraft production ; an important but dreary BuShips job , a career dead end . The Standley request was just an unlucky complication . How to bring up the Nimitz dispatch at this point ? Torpedo water ! " Well , Mr. President , this goes to my head a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . " " Why , that 's most of what I do , old fellow , " the President chuckled . " I just sit here , a sort of traffic cop , trying to direct the right men to the right jobs . " Roosevelt said this with pleasantly flattering intimacy , as though he and Victor Henry were boyhood friends . Cornered though Pug was , he yet could admire the President . The whole war was on this aging cripple 's mind ; and he had to run the country , too , and wrestle with a fractious Congress at every point to get things done . Harry Hopkins was growing restless , Pug could see . Probably some major meeting was scheduled next in this office . Yet Roosevelt could chat on with an anonymous midget of a naval captain , and make him feel important to the war . It was Pug 's way with a ship 's crew ; he tried to give every sailor a sense that he mattered to the ship . But this was leadership magnified to a superhuman dimension , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with . It took all the willpower Victor Henry had , to remain silent under the scrutiny of those wise , weary eyes , two astrallyremote sparks in a mask of intimate good fellowship . Mentioning the Nimitz dispatch was beyond him . It meant undercutting Carton and in a sense turning Roosevelt down flat . Let the President sense his hesitation , at least . Roosevelt broke the slight tension . " Well ! You 've got to take ten days ' leave first , in an ease . Show Rhoda a good time . Now that 's an order ! Then ,  |p532get  in touch with Russ Carton , and one way or another we 'll put you to work . By the bye , how 's your submariner ? " " He 's doing well , sir . " " And his wife ? That Jewish girl who was having difficulties in Italy ? " A drop in the President 's tone , a shift of his eyes to Hopkins , told Pug he was now overstaying his time . He jumped up . " Thank you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ report in ten days to Admiral Carton . Thank you for lunch , sir . " Franklin Roosevelt 's mobile face settled into lines that looked carved on stone . " Your letter from Moscow about the Minsk Jews was appreciated . Also your eyewitness report from the front to Harry . I read it . You proved right in predicting that the Russians would hold . You and Harry . A lot of expertshere were wrong about that . You have insight , Pug , and a knack for putting things clearly . Now , the Jewish situation is simply terrible . I 'm at my wits ' end about that . That Hitler is a sort of satanic person , really , and the Germans have gone berserk . The only answer is to smash Nazi Germany as fast as we can , and give the Germans a beating they 'll remember for generations . We 're trying . " His handshake was brief . Chilled , Pug left . " If you think I 'm a bold hussy , that 's too bad , " said Rhoda . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were burning in the living room fireplace , and on the coffee table were gin , vermouth , the mixing jug , and a jar of olives ; also a freshly opened tin of caviar , thin-cut squares of bread , and plates of minced onions and eggs . She wore a peach negligee . Her hair was done up , her face lightly touched with rouge . " A beautiful sight , all this , " said Pug , embarrassed and yet stimulated , too . " Incidentally , the President sent you his best . " " Oh yes , I 'll bet . " " He did , Rho . He said you 're an elegant and pretty woman , and not easy to forget . " Blushing to her eartips  --  she very rarely blushed , and it gave her a fleeting girlish glow  --  Rhoda said , " Well , how nice . But what happened ? What 's the news ? " Over the drinks he gave her a deliberately laconic report . All Rhoda could gather was that the President had a couple of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to take ten days ' leave . " Ten whole days ! Lovely ! Will either job keep you in Washington ? " " One would . " " Then that 's the job I hope you land . We 've been separated enough . Too much . " When they had eaten a lot of caviar , and finished the martinis , Pug wasp533in the mood , or thought he was . His first gestures were rusty , but this soon passed . Rhoda 's body felt delicious and exciting in his arms . They went upstairs to the bedroom and drew the blinds  --  which nevertheless let through much subdued afternoon light  --  and laughing at each other and making little jokes as they undressed , they got into her bed together . Rhoda swept ahead with her old pleasing passionate ways . But from the moment he saw his wife 's naked body , for the first time in a year and a half  --  and it still seemed dazzlingly pretty to him  --  an awareness seized Victor Henry that this body had been penetrated by another man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; on the contrary , he thought he had forgiven her . At least now , of all times , he wanted to blot the fact out . Instead , with her every caress , her every murmured endearment , her every lovemaking move , he kept picturing her doing exactly this with the big engineer . It did not interfere with what was happening . In a way  --  in a pornographic way  --  that enjoyment even seemed to be enhanced , for the moment . But the end was faint disgust . Not for Rhoda , though . She gave every evidence of ecstatic gratification , covering his face with kisses and babbling nonsense . After a while , yawning like an animal and laughing , she snuggled down and fell asleep . The sun coming through the crack in the curtains blazed a bar of gold on one wall . Victor Henry left her bed , shut out the sunlight , returned to his own bed , and lay staring at the ceiling . So he was staring when she awoke an hour later with a smile.  |p534LESLIE  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old trousers and a tweed jacket hanging in a closet he had locked away from subtenant use , and made toast and coffee in the airless little kitchen as he had done athousand times . Carrying the old portfolio swollen with papers as usual , he walked down to the State Department in commonplace midwinter Washingtonweather ; low gray clouds , cold wind , a threat of snow in the air . It was like returning to normal life after a long illness . The sights and sounds and smells of upper Pennsylvania Avenue , in other times ordinary and dreary , were beautiful to him . The people who walked past him , Americansall , stared at his Russian fur hat , and this delighted him ; in Moscow and in Bern nobody would have noticed . He was home . He was safe . Not since the start of the German march on Moscow , he now realized , had he drawn an easy breath . Even in Bern the pavement underfoot had seemed to quake to the near thump of German boots . But the Germans were no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away ; and the Atlantic headwinds were roaring their icy throats out at other scared men . The rash of small pillars all over the facade of the State Department building did not , this once , seem ugly to Slote , but quaint and naive and homey ; an American architectural abomination , and therefore charming . Armed guards inside halted him and he had to draw a celluloid pass . This was his first brush with the war in Washington . He stopped in the office of the Vichy desk for a look at the confidential list of some two hundred fifty Americans , mostly diplomatic and consular personnel , confined in Lourdes . Hammer , Frederick , Friends Refugee Committee Henry , Mrs ' Natalie , journalistHolliston , Charles , vice consulJastrow , Dr. Aaron , journalistStill there ! He hoped the omission of the baby , as in the list at the London embassy , was an oversight . " Well , here you are , " said the Division Director for European Affairs , standing up and scrutinizing Slote with an oddly excited air . Ordinarily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quiet even when they had played squash together years ago . In his shirt-sleeves , shaking handsp535over the desk , he disclosed the beginnings of a pot belly . His handshake was sweaty and rather convulsive . " And here it is . " He handed Slote a two-page typed document scarred with red-ink cuts . December 15 , 1942 ( tentative ) JOINT UNITED NATIONS STATEMENT ON GERMAN ATROCITIES AGAINST JEWS " What on earth is this ? " " A keg of dynamite , that 's what . Official , approved , ready to go . We 've been at it day and night for a week . It 's all set at this end , and we 're waiting for confirming cables from Whitehall and the Russians . Then , simultaneous release follows in Moscow , London , and Washington . Maybe as soon as to-morrow . " " Jesus , Foxy , what a development ! " People at State had always called the director Foxy . It was his nickname from Yale days . Slote had first encountered him as an alumnus of his secret society @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ superior , and glamorous personage , a career Foreign Service officer just returned from Paris . Now Foxy was one among many men grayish of hair , face , and characterwho strolled State 's corridors in grayish suits . " Yes , it 's a hell of a breakthrough . " " Seems I 've crossed the ocean for nothing . " " Not in the least . The fact that you were coming "  --  Foxy jabbed a thumb toward the portfolio Slote had laid on the desk  --  " with that stuff gave us a lot of leverage . We knew from Tuttle 's memoranda what you were bringing . You served . And you 're needed here . Read the thing , Leslie . " Slote sat down on a hard chair , lit a cigarette , and conned the sheets while Foxy worked on his mail , chewing his lower lip in his old way . Foxy for his part noticed Slote 's unchanged habit of drumming fingers on the back of a document as he read it ; also that Slote looked yellow , and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The attention of His Majesty 's Government in the United Kingdom , of the Soviet Government , and of the United States Government has been drawn to reports from Europe which lcavc no room for doubt that the German authorities , not content with denying to persons of Jewish race , in all the territories over which their barbarous rule has been extended , the most elementary human rights , are now carrying into effect Hitler 's oft-repeated intention to exterminatethe Jewish people in Europe . From all the countries Jews ale he mg transported , irrcNpcetivc of age and sex and in conditions of appalling horror and brutality , to Eastern Europe . In Poland , which has been made the pr rncipalNazi slaughterhouse , the ghettos are being systematically emptied of all Jews except a few highly skilled workers required hm %% , m lmrhi.lrles None oI ' those taken away are ever heard of again . The ablelw , dted au ) slowly worked top536death in labor camps . The infirm are left to die of exposure and starvation or are deliberately massacred in mass executions . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Government , and the United States Government condemn in the strongest possible terms this bestial policy of cold-blooded extermination . They declare that such events can only strengthen the resolve of all freedom-loving peoples to overthrow the barbarousHitlerite tyranny . They reaffirm their solemn resolution to ensure , in common with the governments of the United Nations , that those responsible for these crimes shall not escape retribution , and to press on with the necessary practical measures to this end . Dropping the document on the desk , Slote asked , " Who made those cuts ? " " Why ? " " They castrate the thing . Ca n't you get them put back ? " " Les , that 's a very strong document as it stands . " " But those strikeouts are malevolent surgery . Reports which leave no room for doubt ' says that our government believes this . Why cut that ? Irrespectiveof age and sex ' is crucial . Those Germans are exterminating women and children wholesale . Anybody can respond to that ! Otherwise the thing 's just about Jews . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Now that 's an overwrought reaction . Look , you 're tired , and I think slightly biased , and  --  " " Come on , Foxy , who made those cuts ? The British ? The Russians ? Can we still fight ? " " They came from the second floor here . " A serious look passed between them . " I went to the mat on this , my friend . I headed off a lot of other cuts . This thing will make an explosion in the world press , Leslie . It 's been torture getting three governments to agree on the wording , and what we 've ended with is remarkable . " Slote gnawed on a bony knuckle . " All right . How do we back it up ? " He tapped his portfolio . " Can I prepare a selection of this stuff to release with the statement ? It 's hard confirmation . I can pull together a devastating selectionin a few hours . " " No , no , no . " Foxy shook his head . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to London and Moscow . Weeks could go by in more arguments . " " Foxy , without documentation that release is just a propaganda broadside . Mere boiler plate . That 's how the press will take it . Milktoast stuff anyway , compared to what Goebbels puts out . " The division director spread his hands . " But your material all comes from Geneva Zionists or London Poles , does n't it ? The British Foreign 011ice raises its hackles at any Zionist material , and the Soviets foam at the vcry mention of the Polish government-in-exile . You know all that . Be practical . "  |p537  " No backup , then . " Slote struck a fist on the desk in frustration . " Words . Just words . The best the civilized nations can do against this horriblemassacre , with all the damning evidence in hand . " Foxy got up , slammed his door shut , and turned on Slote , thrusting out a stiff arm and forefinger . " Now look here . My wife is Jewish , as you know "  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hull 's is . I 've given this thing agonized thought , sleepless nights . Do n't wave off what we 've accomplished here . It will make a hell of a difference . The Germans will think twice before proceeding with their barbarities . It 's a signal to them that 'll sink in . " " Will it ? I think they 'll ignore it or laugh it off " " I see . You want a world howl , and a big rescue push by the Allied gov-ernments . " " Yes . Especially of Jews piled up in neutral countries . " " Okay . You 'd better start thinking in Washington terms again . " Foxy slumped in his chair , looking irritated and sad , but he took a cool even tone . " The Arabs and the Persians are already over on Hitler 's side , as you well know . In Morocco and Algeria right now there 's hell to pay about our so-called pro-Jewish policy , simply because our military authorities removed the Vichy anti-Semitic laws . The Moslems are up in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and up ahead in Tunis . If a world howl leads to a popular push to open Palestine for the Jews , that will really kick over the crock in the whole Mediterranean and Middle East . It will , Leslie ! What 's more , it 'll alienate Turkey . It 's an unacceptable political hazard . Do you dis-agree ? " At Slote 's scowling silence , Foxy sighed and talked on , ticking off points on his fingers . " Now . Did you follow the elections while you were over there ? President Roosevelt almost lost control of Congress . He squeaked through in both houses , and that nominal Democratic majority is riddled with rebelliousness . There 's a big reaction gathering force in this country , Les . The isolationists are feeling their oats again . There 's a record defense budget coming up . Big Lend-Lease appropriations , especially for the Soviet Union , which are n't popular at all . Renewal of price controls , rationing , and the draft , vital things the President must have to fight the war . Start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Les , and just watch the counterblast in Congress against the whole war effort ! " " Well delivered , Foxy , " Slote all but sneered . " I know the line well . Do you believe a word of it ? " " I believe all of it . Those are the facts . Unfortunate but true . The Presidentsaw Woodrow Wilson frustrated and his peace plans blown to hell by a Congress that got out of control . I 'm sure the spectre of Wilson haunts him . The newish question is right on the red line , Leslie , in this government'sp538basic political and military policies . The working room is narrow , fearfully narrow . Within those cramped limits , the document 's an achievement . The British drafted it . Most of what I did was fight to keep the substance . I think I succeeded . " Suppressing the old sense of hopelessness , Slote asked , " Okay , what do I do next ? " " You have an appointment at three with Assistant Secretary BreckinridgeLong . " " Any idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not a clue . " " Fill me in on him . " " Long ? Well , what do you know about him ? " " Just what Bill Tuttle told me . Long recruited Tuttle to organize the Republicans for Roosevelt in California . The both raced thoroughbred horses , or something , and that 's how they got acquainted . Also , I know Long was ambassador to Italy . So I guess he 's rich . " " His wife 's rich . " Foxy hesitated , then gave a heavy sigh . " He 's a man on a hot seat . " " In what way ? " Foxy Davis began to pace his small office . " All right , short curriculum vitae on Breckinridge Long . You 'd better know these things . Gentlemanpoliticianof the old school . Fine Southern family . Princeton . Lifelong MissouriDemocrat . Third Assistant Secretary of State under Wilson . Flopped trying to run for the Senate . In electoral politics , a washout . " Foxy halted , standing over Slote , and poked his shoulder . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old Roosevelt man . That 's the key to Breckinridge Long . If you were for Roosevelt before 1932 you 're in , and Long goes back to 1920 , when FDR ran for Vice President . Long 's been a floor manager for him at the conventions . Ever since Wilson 's time he 's been a big contributor to Democratic cam-paigns . " " I get the idea . " " Okay . Reward , the post in Italy . Record , so-so . Admired Mussolini . Got disillusioned . Got recalled . Ulcers was the story . Actually , I believe he behaved ineptly during the Ethiopian war . Came back and raced his thoroughbreds . But of course he wanted back in , and FDR takes care of his own . When the war came , he created a job for Long  --  Special Assistant Secretary of State for emergency war matters . Hence the hot seat . The ref= ugee problem is smack in his lap , because the visa division is his baby . Delegations in an unending parade  --  labor leaders , rabbis , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do more for the Jews . He has to keep saying no , no , no , in polite doubletalk , and he 's too thin-skinned for the abuse that 's ensued . Especially in the liberal press . " Foxy sat down at hisp539desk . " That 's the drill on Breck Long . Now , until you get set , if you want an office  --  " " Foxy , is Breckinridge Long an anti-Semite ? " A heavy sigh ; a prolonged stare , not at Slote but into vacancy . " I do n't think he 's an inhumane man . He detests the Nazis and the Fascists . He reallydoes . Certainly he 's not an isolationist , he 's very strong for a new League of Nations . He 's a complicated fellow . No genius , not a bad guy , but the attacksare hurting and stiffening him . He 's touchy as a bear with a sore nose . " " You 're ducking my question . " " Then I 'll answer it . No . He 's not an anti-Semite . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's being called that . He 's in a rotten spot , and he 's overburdened with other work . I 'm sure he does n't know half of what 's going on . He 's one of the busiest men in Washington , and personally one of the nicest . A gentleman . I hope you go to work for him . I think you can get him to eliminate some of the worst abuses in the visa division , at the very least . " " Good Lord , that 's inducement enough . " Foxy was looking through papers on his desk . " Now . Do you know a Mrs. Selma Ascher Wurtweiler ? Formerly of Bern ? " It took Slote a moment to remember . " Yes . Of course . What about her ? " " She 'd like you to telephone her . Says it 's urgent . Here 's her number in Baltimore . " Heavily pregnant , Selma came waddling behind the headwaiter to Slote 's table , followed by a short red-faced almost bald young man . Slote jumped out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one brooch of big diamonds . Her hand was as cold and damp as if she had been making snowballs . Despite the huge bulge of her abdomen , the resemblance to Natalie was still marked . " This is my husband . " Julius Wurtweiler put warm force into the banal greeting , " It 's a pleasure to meet you ! " As soon as he sat down , Wurtweiler called the waiter and began ordering the drinks and the lunch . He had to see several congressmen and two senators , he said , so he would eat and run , if that was all right , leavingSlote and Selma to chat about old times . The drinks came , with tomato juice for Selma . Wurtweiler lifted his glass toward Slote . " Well , here 's to that United Nations statement . When 's it coming out ? Tomorrow ? " " Ah , what statement would that be ? " " Why , the statement about the Nazi massacres . What else ? " Wurtweiler'spride in his inside knowledge glowed on the healthy face . Better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was , Slote quickly decided . " You have a private line to Cordell Hull , I gather . " Wurtweiler laughed . " How do you suppose that statement originated ? "  |p540  " I 'm actually not sure . " " The British Jewish leaders finally got to Churchill and to Eden with some incontrovertible evidence . Terrible stuff ! Churchill 's heart is in the right place , but he has to buck that damned Foreign Office , and this time he did it . Of course , we 've been kept informed . " " We ? " " The Zionist Councils here . " Before the food came  --  it took a while , because the restaurant was packed  --  Wurtweiler did a lot of talking over the loud chatter all around them . His manner was forceful and pleasant , his accent faintly Southern . He served on several committees of protest and rescue . He had given scores of personal affidavits for refugees . He had twice been in Cordell Hull 's office with delegations . Mr. Hull was a thorough gentleman , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wurtweiler was not in total despair about the massacres . The Nazi persecutionwould prove a turning point in Jewish history , he believed . It would create the Jewish homeland . The political line of the Jews and their friends , he said , now had to be strong and single : Repeal the White Paper ! Open Palestineto European Jewry ! His committee was thinking of following up the Allied statement with a massive popular descent on Washington , and he wanted Slote 's opinion of this . It would be called the " March of the Million . " Americans of all faiths would take part . It would present a petition to the White House , signed with a million names , demanding  --  as the price of continuing Lend-Lease to the British  --  that London repeal the White Paper . Many senators and congressmen were ready to support such a resolution . " Tell me candidly what you think , " Wurtweiler said , attacking a cheese omelette while Selma picked at a fruit salad and gave Slote what seemed a warning glance . Slote put a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could the Jews in German-held Europe actually be moved to Palestine ? No problem , retorted Wurtweiler ; plenty of neutral shipping was available : Turkish , Spanish , Swedish . For that matter , empty Allied Lend-Lease ships could carry them under a flag of truce . But would the Germans honor a flag of truce or release the Jews ? Well , Hitler did want to clear Europe of Jews , said Wurtweiler , and this plan would do it , so why should n't he cooperate ? The Nazis would demand a big ransom , no doubt . All right , the Jews in the free countries would beggar themselves to save Hitler 's captives . He would himself So would his finer brothers . Slote found himself , to his surprise , thinking in Foxy 's " Washington terms " about the matter , in a reaction to this man 's naive self-assurance. 1 Icp541pointed out that such a large transfer of foreign currency would enable the Nazis to buy a lot of scarce war materials . In effect , Hitler would be barteringJewish lives for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see that at all ! " Wurtweiler 's answer shaded into impatience . " That 's weighing remote military conjectures against the certain deaths of innocentpeople . It 's a plain question of rescue before it 's too late . " Slote mentioned that Arab sabotage could close the Suez Canal overnight . Wurtweiler had a brisk answer to " that old chestnut . " The threat to the canal was finished . Rommel was running away from Egypt . Eisenhower and Montgomery were closing a nutcracker on him . The Arabs veered with the winds of victory , and they would n't dare to touch the canal . They were now talking over coffee . As pleasantly as he could , Slote cautionedWurtweiler against the charm of this one big simple answer , the " March of the Million " to open Palestine . He did not think the British would do it , or that there was any way for Jews in Nazi Europe to go there if they did . " You 're a total pessimist , then . You think they must all die . " Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to work for : in the long range to destroy Nazi Germany , and in the short range to frighten the Nazis into stopping the murders . In the Allied world there were many thousands of sparsely settled square miles . Five thousand Jews , to start with , admitted to twenty countries  --  perhaps even including Palestine  --  would add up to a hundred thousand rescued souls . There were more than that many piled up in neutral lands . A concerted Allied decision to give them haven at once would jolt the Germans . At the moment , the Nazis kept jeering at the outside world , " If you 're so worried about the Jews , why do n't you take them in ? " The only answer was shamed silence . That had to end . If America would lead , twenty countries would follow . Once the Allies showed they really cared about the fate of the Jews , that might scare Hitler 's executioners , and slow down or even stop the killing . Agitation to open Palestine was futile and therefore beside the point . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Slote , who thought he was making some headway . " Well , I get your point , " he said at last , " and I completely disagree with you . A hundred thousand Jews ! With millions facing doom ! Once we support such a program , with the little strength we 've got , it 'll mean the end for Palestine . Your twenty havens would back out at the last minute anyhow . And most Jews would n't want to go to them . " With the friendliest farewell , Wurtweiler left after paying the bill , kissinghis wife , and urging Slote to come to dinner soon in Baltimore . " I like your husband , " Slote ventured , as the waiter poured them more cufliee.  |p542Selma  had eaten almost nothing , and she had turned very pale . She burst out , " He has a wonderful heart , he 's given a fortune to rescue work , but his Zionist solution is a dream . I do n't argue any more . He and his friends are so full of plans , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this , that ! They mean so well ! There are so many other committees with different plans , meetings , rallies ! He thinks they 're so misguided ! These American Jews ! They run in circles like poisoned mice , and it 's all too late . I do n't blame them . I do n't blame the Congress , or even your own State Department people . They are n't bad or stupid , they just ca n't imagine this thing . " " Some of them are pretty had and pretty stupid . " She held up a protesting hand . " The Germans , the Germans are the killers . And you ca n't even blame them , exactly . They 've turned into wild animals driven by a maniac . It 's all too hopeless and horrible . I 'm sorry we spent our whole lunch discussing it . I 'll have nightmares tonight . " She put both hands to her temples , and forced a smile . " What 's happened to the girl who looked like me ? And her baby ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! My God ! Is n't she in terrible danger ? " " She 's as safe as our own consular people are . " " Even though she 's Jewish ? " Slote shrugged . " I believe so . " " I 'll dream about her . I dream all the time that I 'm back in Germany , that we never got out . I ca n't tell you what awful , awful dreams I have . My father is dead , my mother 's sick , and here I am in a strange country . I dread the nights . " She looked around the restaurant in a stunned way , and gatheredup bag and gloves in some agitation . " But it 's a sin to be ungrateful . I 'm alive . I 'd better get my shopping done . Will you accept Julius 's invitation to come to dinner in Baltimore ? " " Of course , " Slote said too politely . Her look was skeptical and resigned . On the sidewalk outside she said , " Your idea about refugees is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ losing the war . Soon they 'll start worrying about saving their individual necks . Germans are very good at that . If America and twenty other countries would really take in a hundred thousand Jews now , that could worry those SS monsters . They might start looking for excuses to save Jews , so they could show good records . It 's very sensible , Leslie . " " If you think so , I 'm encouraged . " " Is there any chance of it happening ? " " I 'm going to find out . " " God bless you . " She held out her hand . " Is it cold ? " " Ice . "  |p543  " You see ? America has n't changed me so much . Good-bye . I hope that your friend and her baby will be saved . " Walking back to the State Department under a clearing blue sky , leaninginto a frigid wind , Slote paused and stared through the White House fence across the snowy lawn , trying to imagine Franklin Roosevelt at work somewhere inside that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , newsreels , and millions of newspaper words about him , Franklin Roosevelt remained for Slote an elusive man . Was n't there a trace of fraud about a politicianwho could seem to Europeans a great humanitarian deliverer , yet whose policies , if Foxy was right , were fully as cold and inhumane as Napo-leon 's ? Tolstoy 's grand theme in War and Peace  --  so Slote thought , as he hurried on  --  was the sinking of Napoleon in Pierre Bezukhov 's mind from liberal deliverer of Europe to bloodthirsty invader of Russia . In Tolstoy 's dubioustheory of war , Napoleon was a mere monkey riding an elephant ; an impotentegomaniac swept along by time and history , mouthing orders he could n't help giving , winning battles that were bound to be won , because of small battlefield events that he did n't know about and could n't control ; then later losing wars with the same " strokes of genius " that had brought him " victories , " because the stream of history had changed course away from him , stranding him in failure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Jews , if he would n't even risk a clash with Congress to halt this vast crime , then was n't the President Tolstoy 's monkey after all  --  an inconsequential man , inflated by history 's strong breath into a grandiose figure , seeming to be winning the war only because the tides of industrial prowess were moving that way ; time 's puppet , less free in confronting the Hitler horror than a single frightenedJew escaping over the Pyrenees , because that Jew at least was lowering the toll of murder by one ? Slote did not want to believe any of that . The sunlight streaming through the tall windows of Breckinridge Long 's office was no more pleasant to the eye , or more warm and cheery , than the Assistant Secretary himself , as he strode across the room like a young man to shake hands . Long 's patrician face , thinly chiselled mouth , neat curling irongrayhair , and short athletic figure went with a well-tailored dark gray suit , manicured nails , gray silk tie , and white kerchief in breast pocket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of State ; and far from appearing harried , or bitter , or in any way on a hot seat , Breckinridge Long might have been welcoming an old friend to his country home . " Well , Leslie Slote ! We should have met long ago . How 's your father ? " Slote blinked . " Why , he 's very well , sir . " This was a disconcerting start.  |p544Slote  did not remember his father 's ever mentioning Breckenridge Long . " Have n't seen him since God knows when . Dear me ! He and I just about ran Ivy Club , played tennis almost every day , sailed , got in hot water with the girls  --  " With a melancholy charming smile , he waved at a sofa . " Ah , well ! You know , you look more like Timmy Slote than he himself does now , I daresay . Ha-ha . " With an embarrassed smile , Slote sat down , searching his memory . At Harvard Law School the father had developed a scornful regret for his " wasted " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say , for rich featherheadstrying to avoid an education . He had strongly advised his son to go elsewhere , and had spoken little of his college experiences . But how strange not to mention to a son in the Foreign Service that he knew an ambassador , an Assistant Secretary of State ! Long offered him a cigarette from a silver case , and leaning back on the sofa , fingering the handkerchief in his breast pocket , he said jocularly , " How did you ever happen to go to a tinpot school like Yale ? Why did n't Timmy put his foot down ? " He chuckled , regarding Slote with a fatherly eye . " Still , despite that handicap , you 've made an admirable Foreign Service officer . I know your record . " Was this heavy sarcasm ? " Well , sir , I 've tried . I feel pretty helpless some Ames . " " How well I know the feeling ! How 's Bill Tuttle ? " " Thriving , sir . " " Bill 's a sound man . I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sensitive spot there in Bern . " Breckinridge Long 's eyes drooped half-shut . " You 've both handled matters prudently there . If we 'd had a couple of these radical boys out in that mission , the stuff you 've been turning up might have been smeared all over the world press . " " Mr. Assistant Secretary  --  " " Great day , young fellow , you 're Tim Slote 's son . Call me Breck . " In a memory flash Slote now recalled his father 's talking of a " Breck , " in conversations with his mother long , long ago ; a shadowy figure from his racketing youth . " Well , then , Breck  --  I consider that material I 've brought authentic and appalling . " " Yes , so does Bill . He made that clear . All the more credit to both of you for sensing where your duty lies . " Long fingered his breast-pocket handkerchief and smoothed his tie . " I wish some of these wild-eyed types we 're getting in Washington were more like you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eats the government 's bread should n't embarrass his country . You learned that lesson from that little episode in Moscow . Quite understandable and forgivable . The Nazi oppression of the Jews horrifies me , too . It 's repulsiveand barbaric . I was condemning that policy back in 1935 . My mcnio/randa from those days are right here in the files . Now then , young fellow . Let me tell you what I have in mind for you . " It was a while before Slote found out . Long first spoke of the nineteen divisions he headed . Cordell Hull actually had him drawing up a plan for the new postwar League of Nations . There was a challenge ! He was working nights and Sundays , his health was suffering , but that did n't matter . He had seen Woodrow Wilson destroyed by Congress 's rejection of the League in 1919 . That must not happen to his great old friend , Franklin Roosevelt , and his grand visions for world peace . Also , Congress had to be kept in line , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There was a backbreaker ! If Congress balked at Lend-Lease aid to Russia , Stalin might make a treacherous separatepeace overnight . This war would be touch and go till the last shot was fired . The British could not be trusted , either . They were already intriguing to put de Gaulle into North Africa , so that they could control the Mediterraneanafter the war . They were in this war strictly for themselves ; the British never changed much . After this global rambling , Breckinridge Long came to the point at last . Somebody in the Division of European Affairs should be disposing of Jewish matters , he said , not passing them up to him  --  all these delegations , petitions , correspondence , important individuals who had to be treated with kid gloves , and the like . The situation required just the right man to keep it on an even keel , and he thought Leslie was that man . Leslie 's reputation as a sympathizer with the Jews was a wonderful asset . His discretion in Bern had demonstrated his soundness . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He had a shining future in the Department . Here was a chance to take on a really prickly job , show his stuff , and earn brilliant advancement . Slote was appalled by all this . Taking over as a buffer for Breckinridge Long , " saying no , no , no , in polite doubletalk " to Jewish petitioners , was a disgusting prospect . The end of his career seemed now no farther off than the door of Long 's office , and he hardly cared . " Sir  --  " " Breck . " " Breck , I do n't want to be placed in such a spot unless I can help the people who come to me . " " But that 's exactly what I want you to do . " " But what do I do besides turn them down ? Say ' No , ' every devious way I can think of ? " Breckinridge Long sat up straight , giving Slote a stern righteous stare . " Why- , when you can possibly help somebody , you 're to say yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make that almost impossible . "  |p546  " How ? Tell me . " Breckinridge Long inquired , his manner very kindly . A muscle in his jaw worked , and he fingered first his handkerchief , then his tie . Slote started to explain the preposterousness of requiring Jews to produceexit permits and good conduct certificates from the police of their na- ' tive lands . Long interrupted , his brow wrinkled in puzzlement , " But , Leslie , those are standard rules devised to keep out criminals , illegal fugitives , and other riffraff . How can we bypass them ? Nobody has a God-given right to enter the United States . People have to show evidence that if we let them in they 'll become good Americans . " " Breck , Jews have to get such papers from the Gestapo . That 's obviouslyan absurd and cruel requirement . " " Oh , the New York bleeding hearts have made that a scare word . Gestaposimply means federal Secret Service , Geheime Staatspolizei . I 've had dealings with the Gestapo . They 're Germans like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tough , but we have a mighty tough Secret Service ourselves . Every country does . Besides , not all Jews come from Germany . " Battling a ragged-nerve impulse to walk out and seek another livelihood  --  because he did sense in Long a peculiar streak of honest if perverse reasonableness  --  Slote said , " Wherever the Jews come from , they 've fled for their lives . How could they have stopped to apply for official docu-ments ? " " But if we drop these regulations , " said Long patiently , " what 's to preventsaboteurs , spies , dynamiters , and all sorts of undesirables in the thousandsfrom getting into the country , posing as poor refugees ? Just answer me that . If I were in German intelligence , I would n't miss that bet . " " Require other evidence of good character . Investigation by the Quakers . Affidavits of personal histories . Endorsements by the local U.S. consul . Or by some reliable relief agency , like the Joint . There are ways , if we 'll look for them . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , thoughtfullyregarding Slote . His reply was slow and cautious . " Yes . Yes , I can see merit in that . The regulations can be onerous for deserving individuals . I 've had other things on my mind , like the structure of the postwar world . I 'm not pigheaded and "  --  his smile now was rather harried  --  " I 'm not an antiSemite , despite all the smears in the press . I 'm a servant of the government and of its laws . I try to be a good one . Would you prepare a memorandum on your ideas for me to give the visa division ? " Slote could scarcely believe he was moving Breckinridge Long , but the man spoke with warm sincerity . Emboldened , he asked , " May I offer anotheridea ? " " Go ahead , Leslie . I find this talk refreshing . "  |p547Slote  described his plan for the admission of a hundred thousand Jews to twenty countries . Breckinridge Long listened carefully , fingers moving from his tie to his handkerchief , and back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a second Evian , a major international conferenceon refugees . " " I hope not . Evian was an exercise in futility . Another conference like that will consume a lot of time while people are being slaughtered . " " But the political refugees are a more acute problem now , Leslie , and there 's no other way to get such a thing going . A major policy ca n't be developed on the departmental level . " Long 's eyes were narrowed almost shut . " No , that is an imaginative and substantial suggestion . Will you let me have a confidential paper on it ? For my eyes only , now . Put in all the practicaldetail that occurs to you . " " Breck , are you really interested ? " " Whatever you 've heard of me , " the Assistant Secretary replied with a shade of weary tolerance , " I 'm not given to wasting my time . Nor that of anyone who works with me . We 're all carrying too heavy a load . " But the man might be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very old departmental dodge . " Sir , you know about the joint Allied statementon the Jews , I suppose ? " Long silently nodded . " Do you believe  --  as I do  --  that it 's the plain truth ? That the Germansare murdering millions of European Jews , and intend to murder them all ? " A smile came and went on the Assistant Secretary 's face ; an empty smile , a mere agitation of the mouth muscles . " I happen to know quite a bit about that statement . Anthony Eden drew it up under pressure , and it 's nothing but a sop to some prominent British citizens of that race . I think it will do more harm than good , just provoke the Nazis to harsher measures . But we ca n't pass judgment on that unfortunate race , we must help them if we can , within the law , in their time of agony . That 's my whole policy , and that 's why I want a memo on that conferenceidea right away . It sounds practical and constructive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand . " Now will you help me , Leslie ? I need your help . " Getting to his feet and accepting the handshake , Slote took the plunge . I 'll try , Breck . ' The four-page letter that Slote wrote that night to William Tuttle ended this way : So perhaps you were right , after all ! It 's almost too good to be true , this possibility that I can have some influence on the situation , root out the worstp548abuses , and enable thousands of innocent people to go on living , largely due to the accident that my father was Princeton ' 05 , and Ivy Club . Sometimes things do work out that way in this Alice-in-Wonderland town . If I 'm pitifully deceived , I 'll know soon enough . Meantime , I 'll give Breckinridge Long my full allegiance . Thanks for everything . I 'll keep you informed.  |p549SLOTE  and Foxy Davis were reviewing the early press clippings about the United Nations statement for a first report to the Secretary on the nationalreaction , when Slote remembered that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take these with me , " he said , stuffing the batch into his portfolio , " and draft the thing tonight . " " I do n't envy you , " said Foxy . " Bricks without straw . " " Well , all the returns are n't in . " Walking to the corner to catch a cab , Slote noticed a stack of the new Time magazines , still tied with string , on the sidewalk by a newsstand . He and Foxy had been hungering for a look at it , since a Time reporter had interviewed Foxy on the telephone for almost an hour about the evidence for the massacre . He bought a copy , and in the light of a streetlamp , despite a drizzle that made the pages limp and sticky , he thumbed the issue eagerly . Nothing in the news section ; nothing under features ; front to back , nothing . How could that he ? The New York Times had at least run it on the front page ; a disappointing single-column story , overshadowed by a right-hand streamer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about a cut in gas rationing . Most of the other big papers had dropped it inside , the Washington Post on page ten , but they had all done something with it . How could Time utterly ignore such an event ? He paged through the copy again . Not one word . In the People section the picture of Pamela and her father that he had seen in the Montreal Gazette caught his eye . Pamela Tudsbury , fiancee of Air Vice Marshal Lord Duncan Burne-Wilke ( Time , Feb. i6 ) , will leave London for Washington next month , to carry on the work of her late father as a correspondent for the London Observer . Until a land mine at El Alamein ended Alistair Tudsbury 's career ( Time , Nov. i6 ) , the future Lady Burne-Wilke , on leave from the WRAF corps , glohetrotted with eloquent , corpulent Tudsbury , collaborated on many of his front-line dispatches , barely escaped Jap capture in Singapore and Java . Well , he thought , this may just interest Captain Henry . The flicker of malice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much . To him , military men by and large were grown-up boy scouts ; hard-drinking time-servers at worst , efficient conformists at best , banal **30;5402;TOOLONG to a man . Captain Henry bothered Slote because he did not quite fit the pigeonhole . He had too incisive and agile a mind . On that memorablenight in the Kremlin , Henry had talked up to the awesome Stalin quite well , and he had pulled off a feat in getting to the front outside Moscow . But the man had no conversation , and anyway he reminded Slote of his galling defeats with Natalie and Pamela . Slote had accepted the dinner invitationonly because in all conscience he thought he ought to tell Byron 's familywhat he knew . Welcoming Slote at the door of the Foxhall Road house , Henry scarcely smiled . He looked much older and peculiarly diminished in a brown suit and red bow tie . " Seen this ? " Slote pulled the magazine from his overcoat , open to the photograph . Henry glanced at the page as Slote hung up ' his damp coat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is n't it ? Come on in . I believe you know Rhoda , and this is our daughter , Madeline . " The living room was astonishingly large . Altogether , this establishment looked beyond a naval officer 's means . The two women sat on a sofa near a trimmed Christmas tree , drinking cocktails . Captain Henry handed his wife the magazine . " You were wondering what Pamela would do next . " " Bless me ! Coming here ! Engaged to Lord Burne-Wilke ! " Mrs. Henry gave her husband a sidewise glance and passed the magazine to Madeline . " Well , she 's done all right for herself . " " Christ , she looks so old , so tacky , " Madeline said . " I remember when I met her , she was wearing this mauve halter dress "  --  she waggled one little white hand at her own bosom  --  " all terribly terrific . Was n't Lord BurneWilkethere , too ? A blond dreamboat with a beautiful accent ? " " He was indeed , " said Rhoda . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concert . " " Burne-Wilke 's an outstanding man , " Pug said . Slote could detect no trace of emotion in the words , yet he was sure that in Moscow Pamela Tudsbury and this upright gentleman had been having a hot little time of it . Indeed , it had been his pique at Henry 's success with Pamela that had impelled him to drop his professional caution , and slip the Minsk documents to a New York Times man , thus starting his slide to his present nadir . Pamela 's reaction in London to the news about Henry had indicatedthat the romance was far from dead . If Victor Henry did not have the soul of a wooden Indian , he was very good at simulating it . " Oh , his lordship 's unforgettable , " exclaimed Madeline . " In RAF blue , all campaign stars and ribbons , and so slender and straight and blond ! Sort of a stern Leslie Howard . But is n't that a screwy match ? He 's as old as you , Dad , at least . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she 's older than that , " said Rhoda . " I saw her in London , briefly , " Slote said . " She was rather broken up over her father . " " What news of Natalie ? " Pug asked Slote abruptly . " They 're still in Lourdes , still safe . That 's the nub of it . But there 's a lot to tell . " Madeline , dear , let 's get the dinner on . " Rhoda rose , carrying her drink . " We 'll talk at the table . " The candle-lit dining room had fine sea paintings on the walls and a log fire flaming in the fireplace . The mother and daughter served the dinner . The roast beef seemed a luxurious splurge of money and red points , and the plate and china were far more elegant than Slote had expected . While they ate , he narrated Natalie 's odyssey as he had gathered it from her early letters , some Swiss reports , the Zionist rumors in Geneva , and Byron 's story . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Slote knew nothing of Werner Beck 's pressure on Jastrow to broadcast . A German diplomathad befriended Natalie and her uncle , as he told it , and settled them safely in Siena . But they had illegally disappeared in July , escaping with some Zionist fugitives , and had popped up months later in Marseilles , where Byron had caught sight of them for a few hours . They had planned to join him in Lisbon , but the invasion of North Africa had brought the Germans into Marseilles and prevented their departure . Now they were in Lourdes with all the American diplomats and journalists caught in southern France . He passed over Natalie 's refusal to go with her husband ; let Byron tell that to the family , Slote thought . " Why Lourdes ? " Captain Henry asked . " Why are they interned there ? " " I do n't really know . I 'm sure Vichy put them exactly where the Germanswanted them . " Madeline said , " Well , then , ca n't the Germans take her from Lourdes whenever they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and ship them off to some camp ? Maybe cook them into soap ? " " Madeline , for heaven 's SAKE ! " exclaimed Rhoda . " Mom , those are the gruesome stories going around . You 've heard them , too . " Madeline turned on Slote . " Well , what about all that ? My boss says it 's a lot of baloney , just stale British propaganda from the last war . I just do n't know what to believe . Does anybody ? " Slote contemplated with heavy eyes , across his half-eaten dinner and a centerpiece of scarlet poinsettias , this bright comely girl . For Madeline Henry , clearly , these were all happenings in the Land of Oz . " Does your boss read the New York Times ? There was a front-page story about this day before yesterday . Eleven Allied governments have announced it as a fact that Germany is exterminating the Jews of Europe . "  |p552  " In the Times ? You 're sure ? " Madeline asked . " I always read it straight through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overlooked it , then . " " I did n't notice that story , and I read the Times , too , " Victor Henry observed . " It was n't in the Washington Post , either . " " It was in both papers . " Even a man like Victor Henry , Slote thought in despair , had unconsciouslyblocked out the story , slid his eyes unseeing past the disagreeable headlines . " Well , then they are in a pickle . From what you say , their papers are phony , " Madeline persisted . " Really , wo n't the Germans get wise and haul them off ? " " They 're still in official French custody , Madeline , and their position 's not like that of other Jews . They 're interned , you see , not detained . " " I ca n't follow you , " Madeline said , wrinkling her pretty face . " Neither can I , " said Rhoda . " Sony . In Bern the distinction became second nature to us . You 're interned , Mrs. Henry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've done nothing wrong , you see . You 're just a victim of timing . Internees get traded off : newspapermen , Foreign Service officers , and the like . That 's what we expect to happen with our Americans in Lourdes . Natalie and her uncle , too . But if you 're detained when a war starts  --  that is , if you 're arrested  --  for anything from passing a red light to suspicion of being a spy , it 's just too bad . You have no rights . The Red Cross ca n't help you . That 's the problem about the European Jews . The Red Cross ca n't get to them because the Germans assert that the Jews are in protective custody . Detained , not interned . " " Christ Almighty , people 's lives hanging on a couple of goddamned words ! " Madeline expostulated . " How sickening ! " This one lethal technicality , Slote thought , had penetrated the girl 's hard shell . " Well , the words do mean something , but on the whole I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get home , then ? " Rhoda asked plaintively . " Hard to say . The negotiations for the exchange are well along , but  --  " The doorbell rang . Madeline jumped up , giving Slote a charming smile . " This is all wildly interesting , but I 'm going to the National Theatre , and my friend 's here . Please forgive me . " " Of course . " The outer door opened and closed , letting cold air swirl through the room . Rhoda began to clear away the dinner , and Pug took Slote to the library . They sat down with brandy in facing armchairs . " My daughter is a knucklehead , " Pug said . " On the contrary , " Slote held up a protesting hand , " slug 's very bright.  |p553Do  n't blame her for not being more upset about the Jews than the President is . Victor Henry frowned . " He 's upset . " " Is he losing sleep nights ? " " He ca n't afford to lose sleep . " Slote ran a hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Departmenthas in hand is monstrous . What gets up to the President , of course , I do n't know , and I ca n't find out . It 's like trying to catch a greased eel with oily hands in the dark . " " I report back to the White House next week . Can I do anything about Natalie ? " Slote sat up . " You do ? Do you still have your contact with Harry Hop-kins ? " " Well , he still calls me Pug . " " All right , then . There was no point in alarming you before . " Slote leaned forward , clutching the big brandy glass so hard in both hands that Pug thought he might smash it . " Captain Henry , they wo n't remain in Lourdes . " " Why not ? " " The French are helpless . We 're actually dealing with the Germans . They 've caught some fresh American civilians , and they 're squeezing that advantage . They want in exchange a swarm of agents from South America and North Africa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the Lourdes people will soon be taken to Germany , to build up the bargaining pressure . That will enormously heighten Natalie 's danger . " " Obviously , but what can the White House do ? " " Get Natalie and Aaron out of Lourdes before they 're moved . It might be done through our people in Spain . The Spanish border is n't forty miles away . Informal , quiet deals can be made , sometimes indirectly even with the Gestapo . People like Franz Werfel and Stefan Zweig have been spirited across borders . I 'm not saying it 'll work . I 'm saying you 'd better try it . " " But how ? " " I could attempt it . I know whom to talk to at State . I know where the cables should go . A phone call from Mr. Hopkins would enable me to move . Do you know him that well ? " Victor Henry drank in silence . Slote 's voice tightened . " I do n't want to sound frantic , but I urge you to try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , every Jew io (  --  irotx  --  will be dead . Natalie 's no journalist . Her documents are fraudulent . If they break down she 'll be a goner . Her baby , too . " " Did this Neu ' ' tack Times story say the ( : erin ; ul gm. rnnoent plans to kill all the Jews they can lay their hands on ? " " Oh , the text was fudged , boil the inoplieattoo %v.v. to that effect . ves.  |p554  " Why has n't such an announcement created more noise ? " With an almost insane jolly grin , Leslie Slote said , " You tell me , CaptainHenry . " Leaning his chin on a hand and rubbing it hard , Henry gave Slote a long quizzical look . " What about the Pope ? If such a thing is happening , he 's bound to know . " " The Pope ! This Pope has been a lifelong reactionary politician . A decentGerman priest I talked to in Bern said he prayed nightly for the Pope to drop dead . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pope . But this one is destroying whatever was left of Christianity after Galileo  --  I see that offendsyou . Sorry . All I " want to impress on you is , this is a time to cash whatevercredit at the White House you have . Try to get Natalie out of Lourdes . " " I 'll think about it , and call you . " Slote nervously leaped to his feet . " Good . Sorry if I got worked up . Will Mrs. Henry think me rude if I leave ? I 've got a lot to do tonight . " " I 'll give her your apologies . " Pug stood up . " Incidentally , Slote , when is Pamela getting married ? Did she tell you ? " Slote suppressed the grin of a huntsman who sees the fox break from cover . In his overwrought state , he took this almost as comic relief . " Well , you know , Captain , la donna e mobile ! Pam once complained to me that his lordship 's a slave driver , a snob , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Pug saw him out the front door . He could hear Rhoda pottering in the kitchen . On the coffee table in the living room , the copy of Time lay . Pug opened it and sat hunched over the magazine . He had lost the snapshot of Pamela in the Northampton sinking , but the image was fixed in his memory , a little icon of dead romance . This story of her marriage had hit him hard . Acting indifferent had been tough . She did n't look good at all in this chance shot ; with her head down , her nose appeared long , her mouth prissily thin . The desert sun overhead put dark shadows around her eyes . Yet this small poor picture of a woman four thousand miles away could wake a storm in him ; while toward his very attractive flesh-andbloodwife in the next room he was numb . A hell of a note ! He trudged back to the library , and was sitting there reading Time and drinking brandy when Madeline and Sime Anderson returned from the theatre in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ State Department gone ? Thank heavens , " she said . " How was the play ? Shall I take your mother to see it ? " " Christ , yes , give the old girl some giggles , Pop . You 'll enjoy it yourself , these four girls in a Washington apartment , popping in and out of closets in their scantier  --  " Anderson said , grinning uncomfortably , " There 's not much to it , sir . " " Oh , come on , you laughed yourself silly , Sime , and your eyes aboutp555fell out of your head . " Madeline noticed the Warren album , and her manner sobered . " What 's this ? " " Have n't you seen it yet ? Your mother put it together . " " No , " Madeline said . " Come here , Sime . " Their heads together , they went through the scrapbook , at first silently ; then she began exclaiming over the pages . A gold medal reminded her of how Warren had been borne off the field on his schoolmates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high jump . " Oh , my God , and his birthday party in San Francisco ! Look at me , cross-eyed in a paper hat ! There was this horrible boy , who crawled under the table and looked up girls ' dresses . Warren dragged him out and almost murdered him . Honestly , the memories this brings hack ! " " Your mother 's done an outstanding job , " said Anderson . " Oh , Mom ! System is her middle name . Lord , Lord , how handsome he was ! How about this graduation picture , Sime ? Other kids look so sappy at that age ! " Her father was watching and listening with a cold calm expression . As Madeline turned the pages , her comments died off . Her hand faltered , her mouth trembled ; she crashed the album shut , dropped her head on her arms , and cried . Anderson awkwardly put an arm around her , with an embarrassedglance at Pug . After a few moments , Madeline dried her eyes , saying , " Sorry , Sime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out with him and soon returned . She sat down , crossing shapely legs , quite self-possessed again . It still jarred Victor Henry to see her light up a cigarette with the automatic gestures of a boatswain 's mate . " Say , Pop , a Caribbean sunburn does things for Sime Anderson , eh ? You should talk to him . He tells wild tales about hunting the U-boats . " " I 've always liked Sime . " " Well , he used to remind me of custard . You know ? Sort of bland and blond and blah . He 's matured , and  --  all right , all right , never mind the grin . I 'm glad he 's coming to Christmas dinner . " She dragged deeply on the cigarette and gave her father a hangdog glance . " I 'll tell you something . The Happy Hour is beginning to embarrass me . We tool from camp to camp , making money off the naive antics of kids in uniform . These wise-guy scriptwriters I work with laugh up their sleeves at sailors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get so goddamned mad . " " Why do n't you chuck it , Madeline ? " " And do what ? " " You 'd find work in Washington . You 're an able girl . Here 's this nice house , almost empty . Your mother 's alone . " I per expression disturbed him  --  sad , tiniorous , with a touch of defiant mischief . She had looked like this at limrteen , bringing him a bad reportp556card . " Well , frankly , that very thought crossed my mind tonight . The thing is , I 'm pretty involved . " " They 'll get someone else to handle that fol-de-rol . " " Oh , I like my work . I like the money . I like those numbers jumping up in my little brown bank book . " " Are you happy ? " " Why , I 'm just fine , Pop . There 's nothing I ca n't handle . " Victor Henry was seeing her on this visit for the first time in a year and a half . The letter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she might be named in a divorce action , was going unmentioned . Yet Madeline was flying distress signals , if he knew her at all . " Maybe I should go and have a talk with this fellow Cleveland . " " What on earth about ? " " You . " Her laugh was artificial . " Funnily enough , he wants to talk to you . I was almost ashamed to mention it . " She flicked ash from her skirt . " Tell me , how does the draft work ? Do you know anything about it ? It seems so cockeyed . There are young fellows I know , unmarried , healthy as horses , who have n't gotten their draft notices yet . And Hugh Cleveland 's got his . " " Oh ? Fine , " Pug said . " Now we 'll win the war . " " Do n't be mean . The chairman of his draft board is one of these creeps who enjoy hounding a celebrity . Hugh thinks he 'd better get into uniform . Volunteer , you understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything . Do you know anyone in Navy public relations ? " Victor Henry slowly , silently shook his head . " Okay . " Madeline sounded relieved . " I 've ( lone my duty , I 've asked you . I said I would . It 's his problem . But Hugh really should n't carry a gun , he 's all thumbs . He 'd be more of a menace to our side than to the enemy . " " Does n't he have all kinds of military contacts ? " " You would n't believe how they fade away , once they know he 's got his draft notice . " " Glad to hear that . You should get away from him yourself . He 's nothing but trouble . " " I 'm having no trouble with Mr. Cleveland . " Madeline stood up , tossed her head exactly as she had done when she was five , and she kissed her father . " If anything , the shoe 's on the other foot . Night , Pop . " A really grown-up woman , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . Undoubtedly she was in a wretched mess . But she was young , she had margins for error , and there was nothing he could do about it . Shut it from mind ! He picked up Time to look yet again at the little picture of Pamela and her dead father . " The future Lady Burne-Wilke , " coming to Washington.  |p557Something  else to shut from mind ; and one excellent reason to duck the landing craft job and return to the Pacific . Rhoda had adroitly laid the true basis for salvaging their marriage in the scrapbook there on the table , in the pool of yellow lamplight , where Madeline had slammed it shut . They were linked by the past and by death . The least he could do was cause her no more pain . He might not make it through the war . If he did , they would be old . There would be five or ten years to live side by side in cool decay . She was pitifully contrite , she would surely not slip again , and there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Let time repair what it could . He tossed the magazine in a leather wastebasket , suppressing as kid stuff a notionto tear out the picture , and went off to his dressing room . In her boudoir , Rhoda was thinking , too . Weary from kitchen work , she was more than ready for sleep . But should she tell Pug of her talk with Pamela ? It was the old marital question : have something out , or let it lie ? As a rule , Rhoda thought the less said the better , but this time might be the exception . She was getting tired of remorse . Were those nasty anonymous letterson his mind ? Well , he had been no saint himself . It might clear the air if she put that truth before him . The news of Pam 's engagement was an opening . The scene might be a rough one . Fred Kirby would come up , and possiblythe letters . Still , she was wondering if even that might not be better than the dead thick heaviness of Pug 's long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ candle under the glass jar in the high school experiment , for want of air . Even the lovemaking at night was making little difference . She had a horrid sense that her husband with some effort was being polite to her in bed . Rhoda put on a lace-trimmed black silk nightgown , brushed out her hair for looks instead of pinning it up for the pillow , and out she went , ready for peace or a sword . He was sitting up in bed with his old bedside Shakespearein the cracked maroon binding . " Hi , honey , " she said . He laid the book on the night table . " Say , Rhoda , this fellow Slote has an idea about helping Natalie . " " Oh ? " She got in bed and listened , her back to the headboard , her brow furrowed . Pug was honestly consulting her , by way of trying to grope back to their old footing . She heard him out , nodding and not interrupting . " Why not do it , Pug ? What 's there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to make more trouble for the White House than they 've got . " " I do n't see that . Harry Hopkins may turn you down , for his own reasons . MOUNTAINS of such requests must come his way . But they 're your tinnily , and they 're in danger . To me the real question is , suplxise he 's willing to by ? l ) o you trust Slote that much "  |p558  " Why not ? It 's his field . " " But he 's so , I do n't know , so OBSESSED . Pug , I 'd worry about rocking that boat . You 're far away . You ca n't know what 's going on . By singling them out  --  I mean the WHITE House , honestly !  --  wo n't you throw a spotlight on them ? And is n't their game to stay inconspicuous , just two more names in that batch of Americans , until they get exchanged ? Besides , Natalie 's a pretty woman with a baby . The worst fiends in the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tempting fate to interfere . " He took her hand and squeezed it . " That 's good thinking . " " Oh , I 'm not sure I 'm right . Just be very careful . " " Rhoda , Madeline is getting to like Sime Anderson . Has she talked to you ? Is n't she in a mess in New York ? " Rhoda could not readily share with Pug her own suspicions , and misconductwas a high-voltage topic . " Madeline 's a cool one , Pug . That radio crowd really is n't her kind . If she takes up with Sime , she 'll be fine . " " She says the show 's very dirty . I 'll get us tickets down front . " " Well , how lovely . " Rhoda laughed uncertainly . " You 're an old RIP , and I always knew it . " She was deciding , as she said it , to let the Pamela matter lie . When she emptied the wastebaskets next day , she could n't resist turningthe pages of Time to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course . She felt like a fool . Not all that attractive a woman , at that ; aging fast , and badly . Engaged to Lord Burne-Wilke , besides . Let it lie , she thought . Let it lie.  |p559CHRISTMAS  DAY , 1942 . LOURDES . I awoke this morning thinking of Oswiecim . The Americans in all four hotels were permitted , just this once , to go to church together , to the midnight Mass at the basilica . As usual we were accompanied by our reasonably pleasant Surete shadows , and by the surly German soldiers who since last week have been following us on our walks , shopping trips , and visits to the doctor , dentist , or barber . The soldiers were clearly irked at drawing such disagreeable duty on Christmas Eve ( it is very cold up here in the Pyrenees , and of course neither the basilica nor the hotel lobbies are heated ) when they might have been greeting the birth of their Savior with drunken wassail , or perhaps with animal raptures on the bodies of the few poor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Natalie would not go to the Mass , but I did . It is a very long time since I attended a Mass . In this pilgrimage town you get the real thing , with a crowd of real worshippers ; and because of the shrine , those who come include the paralyzed , the crippled , the blind , the deformed , the dying , a terrible parade ; a parade of God 's cruel jokes or inept mistakes , if you seriously maintain that He heeds the , sparrow 's fall . Cold as it was in the basilica , the air was warm as May compared to the chill in my heart as the Mass proceeded ; chants , bells , elevations , genuflections , and all . It would have been only courteous to kneel at the proper time , as all did , since I had voluntarily come ; but for all the disapproving glances , I , the stiffneckedJew , would not kneel . Nor would I go afterward to a Christmas party for our group at the Hotel des Ambassadeurs , where , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there would be black-market turkey and sausage . I returned to the Gallia , accompanied to the door of my room by a grumpy German with a hideous breath . I went to sleep , and I awoke thinking of Oswiecim . It was in the yeshiva at Oswiecim that I first broke with my own religion . I remember it all ; is though it were yesterday . I can still feel myp560cheek stinging from the slap of the inashgiakh , the study hall supervisor , as I trudge in the snow on the town square in the purple evening , having been ordered out of the bet midrash for impudent heresy . I have not thought about all this for years , yet even now it rises in my mind as an intolerable outrage . Perhaps in a yeshiva in a larger city  --  say Cracow or Warsaw  --  the mashgiakh would have had the sense to smile at my effrontery , and pass it off . Then the whole course of my life might have been different . That slap was the twig that turned the torrent . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good boy ; a " silken boy , " as they would say in Yiddish . I excelled in expounding the abstruse legal distinctionsthat are the meat and the glory of the Talmud , the subtle ethical nuances that the foolish call " hair-splitting . " These arguments have an austere , almost geometrical elegance for which one acquires not only a taste , but a thirst . I did have that thirst . I was a star Talmud student . I was brighter and quicker than the mashgiakh . Possibly he was glad of the chance , narrow thick-skulled black-capped bearded fool that he was , to take me down a peg ; so he slapped my face , ordered me out of the study hall , and set my foot on the path to the Cross . I remember the passage : page one hundred eleven , Tractate Passover Offerings . I remember the subject : demons , and how to avoid them , foil them , and conjure them away . I remember why I was slapped . I asked , " But Reb Laizar , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bearded fool bawling at me , as I lay on the floor stunned , with a flaming cheek , " Get up ! Get out ! Shaygetz ! " ( nonbeliever , abomination ! ) And so I stumbled out into dreary snowy Oswiecim . I was fifteen . To me , Oswiecim was still a big town . I had visited the grand metropolis of Cracow only once . Our village of Medzice , some ten kilometers up the Vistula , was all wooden houses and crooked muddy pathways . Even the Medzice church  --  which we children steered clear of as though it were a leprosarium  --  was built of wood . Oswiecim had straight paved streets , a large railroad station , brick and stone houses , shops with lighted glass windows , and several churches of stone . I did not know the town well . We lived a strictly regimented life in the yeshiva , seldom venturing beyond the mews on which it faced , bounded by our little dormitory and the teachers ' houses . But my rebellious anger that day carried me out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over Oswiecim. , seething at my ill-treatment , giving way at last to the suppressed doubts that had been plaguing me for years . For I was no fool . I knew German and Polish , I read newspapers and novels , and precisely because I was a bright Talmudist I could look beyond the bet midrash to the world outside ; a world glittering with strange dangers and evil temptations , but nevertheless a broader world than one saw in thep561everlasting straight and narrow march down black columns of Talmud , hemmed in by wise but wearying commentators , who absorbed all one 's young wit and energy in exhaustive microanalysis of a main text fourteen centuries old . Between my eleventh year and the moment of the slap , I had been ever more painfully wrenched between the natural yeshiva boy 's ambition to become a world-famous ilui ( prodigy ) , and a wicked whisper in my soul that I was WASTING MY TIME . Thinking of all this as I trudged ankle-deep in snow , freed by the rnashgiakh 's anger to wander like a homeless dog , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I should have forgotten its name ! The one nearest the yeshiva was called Calvaria ; that I recall . This was another , and much more imposing , edifice on a main square . My anger had not cooled . Rather , as the rebelliousness of four years came bursting through the bounds of lifelong drilling and a very tender religious conscience , I did something that a few hours earlier would have been as unthinkable as cutting my wrists . I slipped into the church . Wrapped against the cold , I did not look very different from a Christian child , I suppose . In any case some sort of service was going on , and everybody was looking to the front . Nobody paid attention to me . So long as I live , I shall not forget the shock of seeing a great bloody naked Christ hanging from a cross on the front wall , where in a synagogue the Holy Ark would stand ; nor the strange sweetish Gentile smell of incense ; nor the big painted saints on the side walls . I was stunned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as I then regarded it ) , this was religion , this was the way to God ! Half-horrified , half-fascinated , I stayed a long time . Never since have I felt so alien and alone , so dizzily on the brink of a shattering irreversiblechange in my soul . Never , that is , until last night . Whether it was the cumulative effect of living for weeks in the appalling commercialism of Lourdes , which still garishly pervades the town , even offseason , even in wartime ; or whether it was the pathetic gathering of the maimed in the basilica ; or whether , as once my rebelliousness surfaced , so everything that has been happening to me and Natalie broke through a suppressing instinct in my spirit  --  however all that may be , the fact is that at midnight Mass last night , familiar as Christ on his cross now is to me , and much as I have written about Christianity , and much indeed as I have loved the religious art of Europe , I felt last night as alienated and alone as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woke this morning thinking of it . I am writing this note as I drink my morning coffee . It is not bad coffee . In France , in the depths of war , under the conqueror 's heel , money can still buy everything . The illegal prices are tint even very high in Lourdes . It is off-season.  |p562I  have neglected this diary ever since our arrival in Lourdes ; hoping  --  to be honest  --  that I would resume it on a steamship bound for home . That hope is dimming . Our situation is probably worse than my niece and I admit to each other . I hope her good cheer is more real than mine . She knows less . The consul general wisely avoids upsetting her with the ins and outs of our problem , but he is fairly straight with me . What has gone wrong is a matter far beyond anybody 's control . It was of course the most ghastly misfortune that we failed by a few days to leave Vichy France legally . All was in order , the precious papers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the American landings all train schedules were suspendedand the borders were closed . Jim Gaither acted with coolness and dispatch to protect us , by providing us with official journalists ' documents predated to 1939 , accrediting us to Life magazine , which has in fact published a couple of my essays on wartime Europe . But he went further than that . In the consulate files which they were burning , they turned up some letters from Life , requesting courtesies for various writers and photographers . In Marseilles there is a most accomplishedring of document fakers for refugees , run by a remarkable Catholicpriest . The consul general , despite everything else he had to do in the sudden crisis , obtained through his underground contacts forged letters on the Life letterhead , establishing both Natalie and myself as regularly employedcorrespondents ; papers authentic-looking to the extent of being rubbed , folded , and faded as though they were several years old . James Gaither did not anticipate that these concocted papers would have to shield us for any very long time , but he thought they would stand up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the risk increases . At first he expectedthat our release would he a matter of days or weeks . After all , we are not at war with Vichy France . There is but a rupture of relations , and so Americans are not " enemies " and should not be " interned " at all . But the group here in Lourdes , about a hundred and sixty of us , most definitely is interned . We have been under strict French police surveillance from the start , unable to move about except under the eyes of a uniformed inspector . And a few days ago , Gestapo men took station around all four hotels where we Americans are sequestered . Ever since , we have been under German guard , as well as in official French police custody . The French act vaguely humiliatedand embarrassed by all this , and in small ways try to make us more comfortable . But the Germans are there always , stolidly marching with us wherever we move , staring at us in the lobbies , and ordering us about severely if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Only gradually have I learned what the long delay is all about . For a while Gaither himself did not know . The American charge d'af sires , who was brought here from Vichy with our entire embassy stall , lives in another hotel , and telephone communication is forbidden . The charge , an able manp563named Tuck  --  a great admirer of my writings , though that is neither here nor there  --  is apparently allowed one telephone talk a day , of short duration , with the Swiss representative in Vichy . So we are virtually cut off , especially here at the Gallia , and are very much in the dark . The snag turns out to be simple enough . The Vichy personnel in the United States who should have been swapped for us refused almost to a man to go back to France ; understandably , since the Hun now occupies all of it . This has created great confusion , into which the Germans have stepped to seize an advantage . Thus far they still talk through their Vichy puppets , but it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have gotten away in the first week or two , if the French had simply sent us off the thirty miles to the Spanish lx ) rder . That would have been a decent return for the food and medical supplies America has lavished on this government for years . But the Vichy men are a loathsome form of life  --  crawling , sycophantic , pretentious , lying , self-righteous , anti-Semitic , reactionary , feebly militaristic , and altogether base and unworthy of French culture  --  the very slimy dregs of the anti-Dreyfusards of old . In short , we did n't get out . Here we are , counters in German haggling for assorted Nazi agents being held abroad ; and that they will drive a close and savage bargain goes without saying . I woke thinking of Oswiecim for yet another reason . During our long stay in the Mendelson apartment in Marseilles , a stream of refugees kept passing through , usually staying not more than one or two nights . In consequence , we heard a lot of the grisly talk that circulates in the European @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mass shootings , the gassing in sealed vans , the camps where everybody who arrivesis either murdered outright or starved and worked to death . I have never known how much credit to give to these reports and still do n't , but one thing is sure : a place name that keeps recurring , and that is never utteredexcept in hushed terms of the most profound horror and dread , is Oswiecim ; usually in its ugly Germanization that I remember well , Auschwitz . If these rumors amount to more than mass paranoid fears brought on by suffering , then Oswiecim is the focal point of the whole horror ; my Oswiecim , the place where I studied as a boy , where my father bought me a bicycle , where the whole family sometimes came to spend a Sabbath and hear a great traveling cantor or maggid , a revivalist Yiddish preacher ; and where I first saw the inside of a church and a life-size Christ on the cross . The ultimate menace that faces us , in that case , is transportation to the mysterious and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closing of the circle for me ! But our random existence on this petty planet does notp564move in such artistic patterns  --  that thought really consoles me  --  and we are a continent away from Oswiecim , and only thirty miles from Spain and safety . I still have faith that we will end by going home . It is vital to keep up one 's hopes in a time of danger ; to remain alert , and ready to face down bureaucratsand brutes when one must . That takes spirit . Natalie and the baby , who had a chance to escape , are trapped because at a crucial moment she lacked spirit . I wrote a decidedly intemperate journalentry on Byron 's thunderbolt visit and its miserable outcome . My anger at Natalie was fueled by my guilt at having mired her and her baby in this ever-worsening predicament . She will never let me express it ; invariably she cuts me off by saying that she is grown up , acted of her own free will , and bears me no grudge . Now we have been shadowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while I still think she should have taken the chance and gone with Byron , I can sympathize more with her reluctance . It would be a fearful thing to fall into the hands of these hard uncouth men without legal papers . All policemen , in relation to those they guard , must seem more or less wooden , hostile , and cruel ; for to carry out their orders they must suppress fellow feelings . There has been nothing attractive about the Italian and French police I 've dealt with during the past two years , nor  --  for that matter  --  about certain American consuls . But these Germans are different . Orders do not seem merely to guide their actions ; orders , as it were , fill their souls , leaving no room for a human flicker in their faces or eyes . They are herdsmen , and we are cattle ; or they are soldier ants , and we are aphids . The orders cut all ties between them and us . All . It is eerie . Truly , their cold empty expressions make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the higher-ups are " decent sorts " ( Gaither 's words ) , but I have not met them . I too once knew " decent sorts " who were German . Here one sees only the other face of the Teuton . Natalie might well have chanced it with Byron ; I know no more resolute or resourceful young man , and he had special diplomatic papers . It was a question of a fast dash through the flames . If she had been the old Natalie , she would have done it , but she balked because of the baby . James Gaither still maintains ( if with less assurance as the days pass ) that he advised her correctly , and that all will yet be well . I think he 's beginning to wonder . We talked the whole matter out again last night , Gaither and I , as we slogged through the snow to the midnight Mass . He insists that the Germans , wanting to recover as many of their agents as possible in this swap , are not at any point going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I are three warm bodies , exchangeable for perhaps fifteen Huns . They will he satisfied with that , and will look no further . He does think it is important that I remain inconspicuous . So far we arep565dealing with very low-grade Frenchmen and Germans , none of whom is likely to have read any books in years , let alone one of my books . He says that my credentials as a journalist are holding , and that none of the police officers has yet singled me out as a " celebrity " or person of consequence , nor as a Jew . For this reason he quashed a suggestion that I give a lecture to our hotel group . The United Press man is arranging a lecture series here at the Gallia , to pass the time . The topic he suggested to me was Jesus , naturally . This was a few days ago , and but for Jim Gaither 's veto , I might have consented . But since my experience at the midnight Mass , I would under no circumstances  --  even back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lecture about Jesus . Something has been happening to me that I have yet to fathom . In recent weeks I have found it harder and harder to work even on Martin Luther . Last night that something began to surface . I have still to focus on it and determine what it is . One of these days I shall trace in this journal the path from my first glimpse of Christ crucified in Oswiecim , to my brief conversionto Christianity in Boston , eight years later . Just now Natalie has come in from her bedroom with Louis , all bundled up for her morning walk . In the open doorway our surly German shadow glowers.  |p566ON  New Year 's Eve Pug surprised Rhoda by suggesting that they go to the Army-Navy Club . She knew he detested the rigmarole of paper hats , noisemakers , and alcoholic kissing ; but tonight , he said , he wanted distraction . Rhoda loved the New Year 's Eve nonsense , so she happily got herselfup ; and in the merry crowd of senior military men with their wives moving through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or glittery as she did in the silver lame dress from the old Bundles for Britain days . She had an uneasy moment when , as she and Pug entered the dining room , ColonelHarrison Peters stood up and waved to them to join him . Her conduct with Peters had been snowily blameless , but might he not mention Palmer Kirby , or show too much warmth ? Arm in arm , feeling her hesitate , Pug gave her a questioning look . She decided she did n't give a damn . Let it come out at last ! " Well , bless me ! There 's Colonel Peters . Let 's join him , by all means , " she said cheerily . " He 's a fine man , I 've met him at church . But where on earth did he get that CHORUS GIRL ? Can I trust you at the same table with her ? " Peters towered a head and a half over Pug Henry , shaking hands with him . His blonde bosomy young companion , in a white Grecian-drapery sort of dress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the British PurchasingCouncil . Rhoda mentioned that they knew Pamela Tudsbury . " Oh , really ? The next Lady Burne-Wilke ? " the girl trilled , and her accent stirred an ache in Victor Henry . " Dear Pam ! You could have knocked us all over with a feather at the Council . Pamela used to be our office mutineer . Always mutteringagainst the old slave driver ! Now his lordship will pay for all that overtime , wo n't he just ? " The hour before midnight melted away in dull war talk over ( lull club food and very flat champagne . An Army Air Corps colonel with purple bulldogjowls , sitting at this table by chance with his highly rouged wispy wife , railed at the neglect of the " CBI " theatre from which he had just returned , by which he meant China , Burma , and India . Half the human race lived there , said the colonel ; even Lenin had once called it the richest war prize in the world . If it fell to the Japs , the white man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because Earth would soon be too hot for him . Nobody in Washington seemed to grasp that . An Army brigadier general , with conspicuously more ribbons than eitherPeters or the CBI colonel , held forth on the assassination of Admiralp567Darlan ; whom , he said , he had come to know very well in Algiers . " It 's a great pity about Popeye . That 's what we on Ike 's staff all called Darlan , Popeye . The fellow looked like an insulted frog . Of course he was a plain pro-Nazi , but he was a realist , and once we nabbed him , he delivered the goods , saved a whole lot of American lives . This de Gaulle fellow , now , thinks he 's Joan of Arc . We 'll get nothing from him but rhetoric and grief . Try tellingthat to all these pinko typewriter strategists . " Rhoda might have spared herself any concern about Colonel Peters . He was scarcely looking her way , sizing up instead the squat husband with the forbidding tired face . Pug was saying nothing at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war was going . " Where ? " asked Pug . " All over . How does the Navy see it ? " " Depends , Colonel , on where you sit in the Navy . " " From where you sit , then . " Puzzled by the idle probing of this big good-looking Army man , Pug answered , " I see plenty of hell behind and plenty ahead . " " Concur , " said Peters , as the lights in the noisy dining room blinked and darkened , " and that 's a better year-end summary than I 've read in all the newspapers . Well , five minutes to midnight , ladies and gentlemen . Allow me , Mrs. Henry . " She was sitting beside him , and in an oddly gentle and pleasing way , to which she felt Pug could n't possibly take exception , he placed on her head a paper shepherdess 's bonnet , then tilted a gilt cardboard helmet on his own handsome gray hair . Not everybody at the table put on paper hats , but to Rhoda 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early birthday parties had she seen that happen . On Victor Henry 's head a pink hat with gold frills , far from looking playful or funny , brought out a terrible sadness in his face . " Oh , Pug ! No . " " Happy New Year , Rhoda . " Champagne glasses in hand , the guests stood up to kiss all around and sing " Auld Lang Syne " in candlelight . Pug gave his wife an absent kiss , and yielded her to a polite buss from Colonel Peters . His mind was drifting back over 1942 . He was thinking of Warren leaning in the doorway of the cabin on the Northampton , with one hand on the overhead , saying , " Hi , Dad . If you 're too busy for me , say so " ; and of the officers and men lying entombed in the sunken hull of the Northampton , in the black waters off Guadalcanal . And he was thinking , in the depths of bitter sorrow , that he would ask Hopkins to try to get Natalie and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least was alive . Harry Hopkins 's bedroom in the White I louse was at one end of ' a long dark gloomy hall , a fi.w doors down from the Oval Office . In a gray suit thatp568hung on him like a scarecrow 's rags , he stood looking out toward the sunlit Washington Monument . " Hello there , Pug . Happy New Year . " He kept skinny hands clasped behind his back as he turned . This stooped , shabby , emaciated , yellow-faced civilian made a sharp contrast to the beefy Rear Admiral Carton , red of cheek and straight as a pole , standing near him in tailored blue and gold with a golden froth of shoulder cords . In newspaper accounts Hopkins sometimes seemed a Dumas figure , a sort of shadowy gliding Mazarin in the presidential back rooms ; but face to face he looked to Pug more like a debauched playboy , by the glint in his eye and his fatigued grin still hoping for fun . At a glance Pug took in the dark Lincoln painting and the plaque saying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ homey touches of a rumpled red dressing gown flung over the unmade four-poster bed , a frilly negligee beside it , pink mules on the floor , and bottles of medicines lined up on the bedside table . " Thank you for seeing me , sir . " " Always a pleasure . Sit you down . " Carton left , and Hopkins faced Pug on a wine-colored couch seedily worn at the arms . " So ! Cincpac wants you , too . Popular fella , are n't you ? " Caught by surprise , Pug made no comment . " I suppose that would be your choice ? " " I naturally prefer combat operations . " " What about the Soviet Union ? " " I 'm not interested , sir . " Hopkins crossed bone-thin legs and rubbed a hand over his long curving jaw . " Do you remember a General Yevlenko ? " " Yes . Big burly gent . I met him on my trip to the Moscow front . " " Just so . He 's now Russia 's top dog on Lend-Lease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that area . Yevlenko has mentioned you to Standley . Also Alistair Tudsbury 's daughter , who I gather went along on that trip . " " Yes , she did . " " Well , you both made quite an impression on him . You know , Pug , your report about the Moscow front last December was a big help . I was a lonely voice around here , maintaining that the Russians would hold . The Army 's intelligence estimate was all wrong . Your paper impressed the President . He thinks you have horse sense , which is always in short supply around these parts . " " I thought I 'd queered myself by my gratuitous letter about the Minsk Jews . " " Not at all . " Hopkins casually waved away Pug 's words . " Between you and me , Pug , the whole Jewish situation is a fearsome headache . The Presidenthas to keep dodging delegations of rabbis . The State Department tries to deflect them , but some do get through . It 's all terribly pitiful , but whatcan he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same depressing ground .  |p569Invading  France and breaking up that insane Nazi system is the only way to keep faith with the Russians , save the Jews , and end this damned war . And the key to that is landing craft , my friend . " Hopkins leaned back on the couch with a shrewd look at Pug . Trying to stave off that tricky topic , Pug asked , " Sir , why do n't we take in a lot more refugees ? " " Modify the immigration laws , you mean , " Hopkins replied briskly . " That 's a tough one . " He picked a blue book off a side table , and handed it to Pug . The title was America 's Ju-Deal . " Ever see this ? " " No , sir . " Pug made a disgusted face and dropped it . " Nazi pro-paganda ? " " Possibly . The FBI says it 's been widely circulated for years . It came in the mail , and should have gone into the wastebasket , but it reached my desk , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife and I get a flood of hate mail , Pug . Half of it in various filthy ways calls us Jews , which would be funny if it were n't tragic . It 's hit a peak since the Baruch dinner . " Victor Henry looked puzzled . " Were you still abroad ? Barney Baruch threw a sort of belated  --  and frankly , ill-advised  --  wedding dinner for us . Some reporter got hold of the menu . You can imagine , Pug , a Baruch blowout ! Pate de foie gras , champagne , caviar , the works . With all the discontent about rationing and shortages , I took my lumps again . That , plus the damned lie that Beaverbrookgave Louise an emerald necklace worth half a million as a wedding present , really made things rough around here . I 've got a rhinoceros hide , but I 've exposed Louise to all this by marrying her . It 's terrible . " He made a gesture of loathing at the book . " Well , try to pass a new immigration law , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We 'd probably get beaten on the Hill . Certainly the war effort would suffer . And in the end what good would it do ? We ca n't pry the Jews out of the German clutches . " He gave Victor Henry an inquisitive glance . " Where 's your daughter-in-law now ? " " Sir , that 's why I asked to see you . " Pug described Natalie 's predicament , and Slote 's idea for getting her out of Lourdes . Asking a favor came hard to him , and he somewhat fumbled his words . Hopkins listened with his thin mouth pursed . His reaction was quick and hard . " That 's negotiating with the enemy . It would have to go to the President , and he 'd bump it over to Welles . Lourdes , eh ? Who 's this fellow at State , again ? " He pencilled Leslie Slote 's name and telephone number on a bit of paper fished from his pocket . " Let me look into this . " " I'rn very grateful , sir . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are . The President will call me soon . Ile has a cold andp570he 's sleeping late . " With a grin Hopkins unfolded a yellow sheet from his breast pocket . " Just an average basket of crabs for him today . Like to hear it ? One . Chinese calling home their military mission . Now , there 's a bad business , Pug . Their demands for aid are just moonshine , in view of what we need in Europe . On the other hand , the Chinese front is a running sore for Japan . They 've been fighting this war longer than any of us , and we have to keep them placated . " Two . Heating oil crisis in New England . God ; what a flap ! The weather 's fooled us , it 's been a much colder winter than predicted . Everybody'sfreezing from New Jersey to Maine . The Big Inch pipeline has fallen behind half a year . More controls , more trouble . " Thus he read off and commented dourly on a list of topics : 3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sudden acute shortage of molybdenum. 5 . Pessimistic revised report on rubber. 6 . Another rash of U-boat sinkings in the Atlantic. 7 . German reinforcements in Tunisia throwing back Eisenhower 's advance , and famine in Morocco threatening his supply lines. 8 . General MacArthur again , more troops and air power in NewGuinea desperately needed. g . Revision of the State of the Union speech. io . Plans for a meeting with Churchill in North Africa . " Now that one 's top secret , Pug . " Hopkins rattled the paper at him . " We 'll be going in about a week to Casablanca , Joint Chiefs of Staff and all . Stalin begged off because of the Stalingrad battle , but we 'll keep him informed . We 're going to settle strategy for the rest of the war . The President has n't been in an airplane in nine years , not since he took office . What 's more , no President has ever flown abroad . He 's as excited as a boy . " Victor Henry was wondering at Hopkins 's chatty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forward and touched Pug 's knee . " You know , Stalin 's howling for a Channel crossing this year . That 'll get thirty or forty German divisions off his back , and then he probably could throw the Germans out of ' Russia . He claims we welshed on a second front in ' 42 . But we did n't have the landing craft , and we were n't ready in any respect . The British hate the whole idea of invading France . At Casablanca they 're bound to plead the landing craft shortage again . " Drawn in despite himself , Pug asked , " What are the numbers now , sir ? " " Come here . " Hopkins led Henry into another room , small , airless , full of dowdy old furniture , with one incongruous card table piled with files and papers . " Have a seat . The Monroe Room , they call this , Pug . He signed thep571Doctrine here  --  now , what the devil ! I was just looking at those figures . " He shuffled papers on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pulling out and brandishing an ordinary file card , while Pug marvelled at this slapdash casualness at the hub of the war . " Here you are . Figures as of December fifteenth . They 're cloudy , Pug , because the losses in North Africa are n't firmed up yet . " Victor Henry knew by heart the landing craft projections he had brought to the Argentia conference , and he was shocked by the statistics on the card that Hopkins read off . " Mr. Hopkins , what in God 's name has happened to production ? " Hopkins threw down the card . " A nightmare ! We 've lost a year ! Not only in landing craft , but across the board . The trouble was priorities . Tugs of war between the Army , industry , the home economy , squabbles between this board and that board , jealous infighting among some fine men . All at each other 's throats . Everybody was brandishing triple-A priorities , and nobodywas getting anything delivered . We had a crazy sort of priority inflation , Pug . Priorities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was beyond description . Then along came Victor Henry . " Hopkins laughed at Pug 's astonished blink . " Not really you , of course . Your sort . Ferdie Eberstadt is his name . One of these fellows nobody hears about , who can get things done . You 'll have to meet him . A stockbroker , would you believe it ? A Princeton type straight out of Wall Street . Never in government . They got him down here on the War Production Board , and Ferdie worked out a brand-new priorities scheme . The Controlled Materials Plan , he calls it . It gears all production plans to the flow of three materials  --  steel , copper , and aluminum . That stuff 's being allotted now in a vertical pattern , according to the thing that 's being produced . Destroyer escort , long-range bomber , heavy truck for the Soviets , whatever it is , those materials get allotted to make every single component of the thing . Not horizontally , some here , some there , some to the armed forces , some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wildly about  --  " depending on who has the coziest inside track in Washington . Well , it 's a miracle . Production figures are shooting up all over the country . " He was pacing as he talked , his lean clever face electrically alive . He dropped in a chair beside Henry 's . " Pug , you ca n't imagine what was going on before Eberstadt did this . Piecemeal insanity ! Waste to frighten the gods ! Ten thousand tank tracks , and no tanks to put them on ! A football field full of airplane frames , without engines or controls even being manufactured ! A hundred LCIs ( locked and rusting away , for want of winches to drop and raise the ramps ! " I'lhat awful time is over , and we can get the landing craft we need , but the Navy has to run a coherent show . That means one gmx ) ( I man , a Ferdie Eberstadt , in charge . I 've talked to Secretary Forrestal and to Vicep572Admiral Patterson . They know your record . They 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , spectacle frames to his mouth , his eyes twinkling . " Well , old top ? Will you sign on the dotted line ? " The telephone on the card table rang . " Yes , Mr. President . Right away . As it happens , Pug Henry 's here . . . Yes , sir . Of course . " He hung up . " Pug , the boss will say hello to you . " They walked out into the dark book-lined hall and down a rubber-paddedramp toward the Oval Office . Hopkins took Pug 's elbow . " What say ? Shall I tell the President you 're taking it on ? There are a lot of Navy captains who can do Cincpac 's staff work , you know that . There 's only one Pug Henry who has a grasp of landing craft from A to Z. " Victor Henry had never before had a clash of wills with Hopkins . The great seal of the Presidency was in this man 's pocket . Yet he was not the Commander-in-Chief , or he would be issuing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the flattery about Eberstadt , and now this arm-twisting were tactics of a powerful subordinate . Hopkins had taken it into his head to put him in landing craft , and the visit about Natalie had given him his opening . He probably did this sort of persuasion all the time . He was damned good at it , but Victor Henry meant to go to Cincpac . Hopkins 's airy dismissal of that job was civilian talk . There were plenty of good men in the landing craft program , too . They were walking past the Oval Office toward the open door of the President 's bedroom . The President 's rich resonant voice sounded hoarse today . Pug felt a touch of awe and affection at hearing Franklin Roosevelt 's accents . " Mr. Hopkins , this probably means the rest of my war service . Let me talk it over down at BuShips . " Harry Hopkins smiled . " Oke . I know they 're all for it . " They entered the bedroom just as the President violently sneezed into a large white handkerchief Rear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bed in full uniform . He and several elderly civilians in the room chorused , " God bless you . " Pug recognized none of the civilians . They all stared at him , looking self-important , while McIntire , whom he had known in San Diego , gave him a slight nod . Wiping his reddened nose , the President glanced up blearily at Pug . He was sitting propped on cushions , wearing over wrinkled striped pajamas a royal blue cape , with FDR monogrammed on it in red . Picking pince-nez glasses off a breakfast tray , he said , " Well , Pug , how are you ? Did you and Rhoda have a nice New Year ? " " Yes , thank you , Mr. President . " " Good . What were you and Harry cooking up just now ? Where are you going next ? "  |p573It  was an offhand polite question . The other men in the room were looking at Henry as at an interloper , like a Roosevelt grandchild who had wanderedin . Despite the President 's cold , which showed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a gay air , a look of relish for the new day 's business . Victor Henry plunged , fearing Hopkins might overcommit him by speaking up first . " I 'm not sure , Mr. President . Admiral Nimitz has requested my services as Deputy Chief of Staff for Operations . " " Oh , I see ! Really ! " The President arched his heavy brows at Hopkins . Clearly this was news to him . A shade of vexation flickered over Hopkins 's face . " Well , then , that 's where you 'll go , I suppose . I certainly could n't blame you for that . All the best . " Roosevelt rubbed his eyes with two fingers , and put on his glasses . This changed his aspect . He looked younger , more formidable , more the familiar President of the newspaper pictures , less an old man with mussed gray hair in bed with a cold . Obviously he was finished with Victor Henry , and ready to get on with his morning 's work . He was turning toward the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with a few words that haunted his memory always . There was a touch of disappointment in the President 's reaction , a resigned acceptance of a naval officer 's narrow human desire to promote his own career during a war , that stung him into saying , " Well , Mr. President , I 'm always yours to command . " Roosevelt turned back to him with a surprised and charming smile . " Why , Pug , it 's just that Admiral Standley really did feel he could use you in Moscow . I had another cable from him about you only yesterday . He has his hands full over there . " The President 's jaw lifted and stuck out . A formidable . aspect came over him , as he straightened up under the cape . " We 're fighting a very big war , you know , Pug . There 's never been anything like it . The Russians are difficult allies , Heaven knows , perfectly awful to deal with sometimes , but they are tying down three and a half million German soldiers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ win this war . If for some reason they do n't , we may lose it . So if you can help out in Russia , and my man on the spot seems to think so , why , maybe that 's where you should be . " The faces of the other men were turned to Victor Henry with mild curiosity , but he was scarcely aware of them . There was only the sombre face of Roosevelt before him ; the face of a man he had once known as a handsome Assistant Secretary of the Navy , scrambling up a destroyer 's ladders like a Ixoy ; now the visible face of American history , the face of a worn old cripple . " Aye aye , sir . In that case , I 'll go from here to the Bureau of Personnel , and request those orders . " A pleased light came into the President 's eyes . He held out his hand with a sweep of a long arum from under the cape , gesturing manly gratitudep574and admiration . It was all the reward Victor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in after years , it seemed enough . A love for PresidentRoosevelt welled up in his heart as they shook hands . He tasted the acrid pleasure of sacrifice , and the pride of measuring up to the **26;5434;TOOLONG of him . " Good luck , Pug . " " Thank you , Mr. President . " A friendly nod and smile from Franklin Roosevelt , and Victor Henry was walking out of the bedroom , the course of his days turned and fixed . Hopkins , near the door , drily said , " So long , Pug . " His eyes were narrow , his smile cool . Rhoda jumped up as her husband walked into the living room . " Well ? What 's the verdict ? " He told her . At the way her face fell , Pug felt a passing throb of his old love for her , which only told him how nearly it was gone . " Oh , dear , and I was so hoping for Washington . Was that what you wanted  --  Moscow again ? " " It 's what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Maybe two years . " " It means a long time . " She took his hand , and twined her fingers in his . " Oh , well . We 've had a lovely couple of weeks . When do you take off ? " " As a matter of fact , Rho "  --  Pug looked uncomfortable  --  " BuPers used some muscle and put me on the Clipper that leaves tomorrow . " " Tomorrow ! " " Dakar , Cairo , Tehran , Moscow . Admiral Standley really seems to want me there . " They drank their best wine at dinner , and fell into reminiscing about old times , about their many separations and reunions , retracing the years until they were back to the night when Pug proposed . Rhoda said , laughing , " Nobodycan say you did n't warn me ! Honestly , Pug , you talked on and on about how AWFUL it was to be a Navy wife . The separations , the poor pay , the periodicuprooting , the kowtowing to the wives of big brass , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SWEAR , I thought you were trying to talk inc out of it . And I said to myself , Fat chance , mister ! This was your idea , now you'reHOOKED . ' " " I thought you should know what you were getting into . " " I 've never regretted it . " Rhoda sighed , and drank her wine . " It 's such a pity . You 'll miss Byron . That convoy should be getting here any day . " " I know . I do n't like that much . " They were relaxed enough , and Rhoda was female enough , and it wasp575near enough to the end , so that she could n't resist adding , very casually , " And you 'll miss Pamela Tudsbury . " He looked her straight in the eye . What they had never yet talked about suddenly lay , as it were , out on the table  --  his romance with Pamela , and her affair with Palmer Kirby , a name that had not crossed his lips , any more than Warren 's had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Long seconds passed . Rhoda 's eyes dropped . " Well , if you can stand it , I 've made an apple pie . " " Great . I wo n't get that in Moscow . " They went to bed early . The lovemaking was self-conscious and soon past , and Pug fell heavily asleep . After smoking a cigarette , Rhoda got up , put on a warm robe , and went downstairs to the living room . The album of records she pulled out from a low shelf was dusty . The record was scratched and slightly cracked , and the faded orange label was scrawled over with crayon , for at one point the kids had gotten at this album , and had played the records to death . The old recording was tinny and high-pitched , a ghostly voice from the distant past , coming weak and muffled through the worn surface : It 's three o'clock in the morning We 've danced the whole night through And daylight soon will be dawning Just one more waltz with you . . . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ensign Pug Henry , the Navy football star , was taking her to some big dance . He was much too short for her , but very sweet and somehow different , and crazily in love with her . It showed in his every word and look . Not handsome , but virile , and promising , and sweet . Irresistible , really . That melody so entrancingSeems to be made for us twoI could just keep right on dancing Forever dear with you . The antique jazz band sounded so thin and old-fashioned ; the record ran out so fast ! The needle scratched round and round and round , and Rhoda sat there staring dry-eyed at the phonograph.  |p579PUG  did n't miss Byron by much . Two days after the Clipper left for the Azores on the first leg o circuitous flight to Moscow , the destroyer Brown came steaming up-cha into New York harbor . Happy sailors crowded the flying bridge , h jammed in the pockets of their pea jackets , feet stamping , breath smokir eager ribald talk about shore leave . Byron stood apart from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ muffler , and white peaked cap , staring up al Statue of Liberty as the green colossus slid past , starkly lit by a clear midwinter sunrise . The crew were wary of this passenger officer . Bec the wardroom was short-handed he had stood deck watches under w ; cool shiphandler who spoke little and smiled less while on the bridge . . ing the watch list had made Byron feel that he was getting back in the and the officers of the Brown , relieved of a grinding one-in-three , gratefully treated him as one of themselves . As the convoy scattered , the merchant vessels heading for the New sey shore or the sunlit skyscrapers of Manhattan , the screening ships to , Brooklyn , Byron impatiently jingled in a coat pocket a fistful of sweaty c ters . When the Brown tied up at a fueling dock , he was the first man c the gangway and into the lone telephone booth on the wharf . A quer sailors was lined up at the booth by the time his call got through the Department switchboard . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back ? " Leslie Slote soul hoarse and harried . " Brooklyn Navy Yard . Just docked . What about Natalie and the kic " Well  --  " at Slote 's hesitation , Byron immediately felt sick , "  --  the all right , and that 's the main thing , is n't it ? The fact is , they 've been m , to Baden-Baden with those other Americans who were in Lourdes . Just porarily , you understand , before they 're all exchanged , and  --  " " Baden-Baden ? " Byron broke in . " You mean Germany ? Natalie Germany ? " " Well , yes , hurt  --  " " GOD ALMIGHTY ! " " Look , them are reassuring aspects to this . They 're in a superb Ii getting A-one treatment . The Brenner 's Park . They 're still classed as joup580ists , still in with diplomats , newspapermen , Red Cross workers , and such . Our charge d'affaires who was in Vichy , Pinkney Tuck , heads the group . He 's a top man . A Swiss diplomat is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Also a German Foreign Ministry man and a French official . We 're holding plenty of Germans that their government wants back very badly . It 'll just be a haggling process . " " Are there any other Jews in that group ? " " I do n't know . Now , I happen to be busy as hell , Byron . Phone me at home tonight , if you like . " Slote gave him the number and hung up . As Byron 's white forbidding face passed through the wardroom full of officers dressed for going ashore , the raillery died . Alone in his cabin , folding uniforms into his footlocker , he tried to plan his next move , but he could scarcely think straight . If one brush with Germans on a French train had been too grim a risk for Natalie to take , what about now ? She was in Nazi Germany , over the line , over on the other side ! It was beyond imagining ; she must be scared out of her mind . In Lisbon Slote had told a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even claiming that he was returning to Washington to deliver evidence to President Roosevelt . Byron found the story beyond belief , a hysterical exaggeration of what was probably going on in Germany in the fog of war . He did not fear that his wife and son really risked being caught in a continent-wide process of railroading Jews to secret camps in Poland , where they would be gassed to death and their bodies burned up . That was a fairy tale ; even Germans could not do such things . But he did fear that their diplomatic protection might fail . They were illegal fugitives from Fascist Italy , and their journalist credentials were phony . If the Germans turned ugly , they might be singled out first for harsh treatment , among those Americans trapped in Baden-Baden . Louis might sicken or die from mistreatment ; he was such a little thing ! Byron left the Brown stink in wretchedness . Trudging through the Navy Yard with his footlocker , amid laborers thronging off their jobs for lunch , he decided that if he could locate Madeline , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Washington , and from there fly to San Francisco , or to Pearl Harbor if the Moray had departed . But how to get hold of Madeline ? His mother had written that she was back working for Hugh Cleveland , and had sent him an address on Claremont Avenue , just off the Columbia campus . He could drop his stuff at his old fraternityhouse , he figured , and spend the night there if he could n't track her down . Since their parting in California , he had not heard from her . The cab wound through Brooklyn , came out on the Williamsburg Bridge for another brilliant view of the skyscrapers , then plowed into the lower east side of Manhattan , where Jews in numbers were hustling along the sidewalks . His mind circled back to Natalie . She had struck him from thep581start as a sophisticated American , all the more alluring for a dusky spicy trace of Jewishness  --  to which she had never alluded in the old days except in self mockery , or in contempt for Slote because he had allowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overpowered , paralyzed , by her Jewishness . Byron could not understand . He took little account of race differences ; he thought it was all bigoted nonsense , and his attitude toward the Nazi doctrines was one of incredulous contempt . He felt out of his depth in this thing , but the residue was anger and frustration at his stiff=necked wife , and scarcely endurable concern for his son . The fraternity house had the same old dusty banners and trophies on the walls . The brick fireplace was piled as ever with cold wood ashes , fruit peelings , cigarette packages and butts , and over the mantel , the portrait of an early benefactor was much darkened by more years of wood smoke and tobacco fumes . As always , two collegians clicked away at the ping-pong table , watched as always by idlers on broken-down sofas ; and as always blaringjazz shook the walls . Surprisingly callow and pimply high school boys seemed to have taken over the place . The spottiest of these introduced himself to Byron as the chapter president . He had obviously never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Hey , " he bellowed up the stairs , " anybody using Jeff 's room ? Old grad here for overnight . " No answer . The spotty president ascended with Byron to a hack bedroom where the same sepia picture of Marlene Dietrich hung , wrinkling and askew . The president explained that the occupant Jeff , about to flunk all his midterms , had abruptly joined the Marines . The wise-guy Columbia grin that went with this disclosure made Byron feel more at home . One o'clock . No use trying to track down Madeline now , all those radio types would be out to lunch . Byron had stood the midwatch , and had stayed awake ever since . He set his alarm for three and stretched out on the dingy bed . The discordant crash and bleat of jazz did not keep him from falling fast asleep . Cleveland , Hugh , Enterprises , Inc. 63o Fifth Avenue . The directory at the telephone under the staircase was a couple of years old , but he tried the number . A blithe girlish voice came on . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Hello , I 'm Madeline Henry 's brother . Is she there ? " You ARE ? You 're Byron , the submarine officer ? Really ? " " That 's right . I 'm in New York . " " Oh , how terrif ! She 's at a meeting . Where can she reach you ? She 'll be back in an hour or so . " Byron gave her the niinrbcr of the pay telephone , hunted up the spottyp582president through the smoke , and got his promise to take any message that came in . He escaped from the jazz din into the windy freezing street , where he heard very different music : the " Washington Post March . " On South Field , blue-coated ranks of midshipmen were marching and countermarchingwith rifles . In Byron 's time the only marching on South Field had been for anarchic antiwar rallies . These fellows might be a year getting out to sea , Byron thought , and then months would pass before they could stand watch under way . This marching mass of unblooded reservists made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he wondered , in his low frame of mind , what was so praiseworthy about repeated exposure to getting killed . Why not walk to the Prairie State , scene of his own reserve training ? Nothing else to do . He strode up Broadway , and over to the river on 125th Street . There was the old decommissioned battleship , tied up and swarming with midshipmen . The smells from the Hudson , the piping and loudspeaker announcements , deepened his nostalgia . On the Prairie State , in the long bull sessions at night , there had been so much talk of the kind of wife one wanted ! Hitler and the Nazis then had been ludicrous figures in the newsreels ; and the Columbia demonstrators had been signing pledges right and left not to fight in any wars . Natalie 's predicament seemed , in the familiarscene at the foot of 125th Street , a dim incredible nightmare . It occurred to Byron that he could go back to the fraternity house through Claremont Avenue , and slip a note under Madeline 's door telling her where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pressed the outside call bell beside her name . The door buzzed in reply ; so she was in ! He opened the door , leaped up two flights of stairs , and rang her bell . It is almost never a good idea to walk in on a woman without warning her : not a sweetheart , not a wife , not a mother , and certainly not a sister . Madeline , in a fluffy blue negligee , with her black hair down to her shoulders , looked out at him . Her eyes rounded and popped , and she exclaimed " EEK ! " exactly as though he had come upon her naked , or as though he were a rat or a snake . Before Byron could say anything , a deep rich male voice rumbled from inside , " What is it , honey ? " Hugh Cleveland came in sight , nude to the waist , and below that clad in a flopping flowery lava-lava , scratching his hairy chest . " It 's Byron , " Madeline gasped . " How are you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Fully as disconcerted as she was , Byron asked , " Did n't you get my mes-sage ? " " What message ? No , nothing . Well , Jesus Christ , now that you 're here , come in . " " Hi , Byron , " said Hugh Cleveland , with the charming smile that showed all his big white teeth.  |p583  " Say , are you two married already ? " Byron said , walking into a well-furnishedliving room where an ice bucket , a bottle of Scotch , and soda bottles stood on a table . Cleveland and Madeline exchanged a look , and Madeline said , " Sweetie , how long will you be here , anyway ? Where are you staying ? Jesus Christ , why did n't you write or telephone or something ? " A door was open to a bedroom , and Byron could see a big rumpled doublebed . Though abstractly he accepted the possibility that his sister was misbehaving , he literally did not believe his eyes . He said to Madeline , with clumsy blundering bluntness , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or what ? " Hugh Cleveland might have been well-advised to keep quiet at this point . But he smiled a big white smile , spread his hands , and rumbled warmly , " Look , Byron , we 're all adults , and this is the twentieth century . So if you 'll  --  " Byron swiftly drew back his arm despite the bulk of his bridge coat , and crashed a fist into Cleveland 's smiling face . Madeline gave another " EEK ! " louder and shriller than before . Clevelandwent down like a poled ox , but he was not really knocked out , because he landed on his hands and knees , crawled about , and got up . As he did so his lava-lava fell off , and he was standing stark naked , with a sizable white paunch protruding over his spindly legs and private parts . This unprepossessingsight was quite eclipsed by the astounding transformation of his face . He looked like Dracula . All his upper front teeth were filed to sharp little points , with slightly longer fangs at either end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out , " your teeth ! Look at your teeth ! " Hugh Cleveland stumbled to a wall mirror , grinned at himself , and utteredan eerie wail . " Jethuth Chritht , my bridge ! My porthelain bridge . It cotht me fifteen hundred fucking dollarth ! Where the hell ith it ? " He glanced wildly around the floor , turned on Byron and lisped in great indignation , " Why the hell did you thock me ? How ridiculouth can you get ? Let'th find that bridge , and damned fatht ! " " Oh , Hugh , " Madeline said nervously , " put something on , for Heaven 's sake , will you ? You 're prancing around naked as a jaybird . " Cleveland blinked down at his bare body , snatched the lava-lava , and fastened it on as he strode around searching the floor for his bridgework . Byron saw a white thing lying on the carpet under a chair . " Is this it ? " he said , picking up the object and offering it to Cleveland . " Sorry I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the man was a pitifully idiotic sight with his sharpened-down tooth stumps , and the lava-lava carelessly dragging on his bulging belly . ' That'th it ! " Cleveland went back to the mirror , and with two thumbsp584pressed the thing into his mouth . He turned around . " How 's that , now ? " He looked normal again , flashing the celebrated smile that Byron had seen in so many magazine advertisements of Cleveland 's radio sponsor , a toothpaste company . " Oh , heavens , that 's better , " said Madeline , " and Byron , you apologize to Hugh . " " I did , " Byron said . After grimacing at himself in the mirror and gnashing his teeth to test the fixity of the bridge , Cleveland turned to them . " Well , it 's just a damned good thing it did n't break . I 've got that U.S. Chamber of Commerce banquet tonight to toastmaster , and that reminds me , Mad , Arnold never did give me my thcript . What am I thuppothed to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It'th thlipping ! I 'm loothing it ! " As he talked , Byron could indeed see the bridge come loose and drop out of his mouth . Cleveland lunged to catch it , stepped on the hem of the lava-lava , and fell on his face naked again , the flowery cloth pulling off and crumpling under him . Madeline clapped her hand to her mouth and glanced at Byron , her wide eyes sparkling with their sense of fun shared since childhood . Hurrying to Cleveland , she spoke in tones of tender concern , " Are you hurt , honey ? " " Hurt ? Thit , no . " Cleveland got to his feet , the bridge clutched in his fingers , and strode to the bedroom , his plump white bottom waggling . " Thith ith damned theriouth , Mad . I 'm calling my dentitht , and he better be in ! I 'm getting paid a thouthand buckth to be toathtmathter tonight . Thon of a bith ! " He slammed the door . Picking up the lava-lava , Madeline snapped at Byron , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an ANIMAL ! " Byron glanced around the room . " Honestly , what is this setup , Madeline ? Does he live here with you ? " " What ? How can he ? He 's got a family , stupid . " " Well , what are you doing then ? " Pouting , she did not answer . " Mad , are you just having a toss now and then with this fat old guy ? How is that possible ? " " Oh , you do n't understand anything . Hugh is a friend , a dear good friend . You 'll never know how good he 's been to me , and what 's more  --  " " You 're committing adultery , Mad . " A fleeting miserable look came and went on her face . Madeline flipped a hand , shook her head , and smiled a super-wise female smile . " Oh , you 're so naive . His marriage is better now than it was , MUCH better . And I 'm a much better person . There 's more than one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a family of fossils . I know Hugh would marry me if I pushed him , he 's daffy about me , but  --   |p585Half-dressed  , Cleveland looked out of the bedroom and lisped loudly at Madeline that his dentist was driving in from Thcarthdale . " Call Tham right away . Tell him to get hith ath over here in ten minuteth . Chritht , what a meth ! " " Tham ? " Byron said as Cleveland closed the door . " Sam 's his chauffeur , " Madeline said , hurrying to a telephone and dialling . " Oh , Byron , are you disowning me ? Can I cook you a dinner ? Shall we get blind drunk tonight ? Want to stay here ? There 's a spare room . When are you leaving ? What 's the news of Natalie ?  --  Hello , hello , let me talk to Sam . . . Well , find him , Carol . Yes , yes , I KNOW my brother Byron 's in town . Jesus Christ , do I know it . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get the Cadillac over here in ten minutes flat . " She said as she hung up , " Byron , I 've worked for Hugh for four years , and I did n't know he had bridgework . " " Live and learn , Mad . " " If the whole thing were n't so awful , " she said , " and if you were n't such a disgusting neanderthal , it would be the funniest goddamned thing I 've been through in my life . " Her mouth was wrinkling , suppressing laughter . " I 've nagged him for years to get rid of that horrible stomach . Look at you , now ! Flat as a boy , just like Dad . Will you give your adulterous sister a kiss ? " " Lechery , lechery ; still , wars and lechery ; nothing else holds fashion , rails the sour Thersites . " A burning devil take them ! " Janice had some warning , so she was able to receive Byron in poised innocence ; as Madeline could have done too , given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - ssed through Honolulu , dissembling to him about her affair with Carter . ster had given her not a qualm . It was none of his business . No man could think like a woman about these things , least of all Captain Victor Henry , who would n't even play cards on Sunday . Frankness would have led only to embarrassment , and no possible useful purpose would have been served . But Byron 's cable posed a problem to Janice . Aster had told her that her brother-in-law would be reporting to theMoray . Byron was altogether a peculiar sort , fully as dashing as Warren , butwith a sweetly idealistic attitude toward women which could prove a nuisance . His moral views seemed as narrow as his father 's . His tale about thegirl in Australia had been all but incredible , but Janice had believed it . Whatwould have been the point of a lie that made hint out a prudish simpleton ? Yet , when a war was on , when men were far from home and lonely , when everywhere there was great activity in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phrase that much amused Janice , though she pretended to bridle at it  --  why should Byron have denied himself a natural and beautiful relationship ? The Aster affair had sprung up more or less accidentally . After Midway an attack of dengue fever had laid her low , and Carter Aster had visited her every day and had seen to her needs of food and medicine , and one thing had led to another . She knew that Byron would be scandalized if he found out . Janice did n't understand that side of Byron ; he was damned different from his brother . She regarded his prudishness as a quaint minor foible , and she certainly did not want to disillusion or estrange him . She considered herself a Henry , she liked that family better than her own , and she had always found Byron a very attractive man . It was wonderful to have him around . So as Aster was getting dressed to return to the submarine late one night , Janice decided to take things in hand . She was smoking a cigarette in bed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the morning , honey . " " He is ? " Aster paused in pulling on khaki trousers . " So soon ? How do you know that ? " " He cabled me from San Francisco . He 's getting a ride on NATS . " " Well , great ! It 's high time . We need him aboard . " It was past midnight . Aster never stayed till morning . He liked to be up and about on the submarine at reveille ; also , he was tender of Janice 's reputation , living as she did in a row of houses with early-rising neighbors . Janice loved Aster , or at least loved her hours with him , but she wanted nothing permanent with him . He had nothing like Warren 's breadth , he read trash , and his talk was pure Navy . He reminded her of the many Pensacola pilots who had bored her before Warren had come along . Aster was an able naval engineer , " with an urge to excel and to kill , born for submarining . And he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for unauthorized ass , so to say , but not much more . If Aster sensed her qualified regard for him , he.was n't complaining . " The point is , dear , " Janice said , " that hanky-panky has to be out for a while . " He gave her a cool inquiring look , tucking in his shirt . " I mean , you know Byron . I love him dearly . I do n't want him getting all upset and disapproving . I ca n't have it . " " Now let me understand you . Are you calling it off ? " " Oh , would you mind , all that much ? " " Hell , yes , I 'd mind , Janice . " " Well , do n't look so tragic . Smile . " " Why does Byron have to know ? " " When you 're in port , he 'll be spending nights here . " " He 'll have the duty every other night . " " Yes , I suppose he will . All the same  --  " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gathered her in his arms . After a breathless few kisses she murmured , " Well , we 'll see , we 'll see . One thing , Carter . Byron must never , never find out . Understand ? " " Sure , " Aster said . " No need for it . " The morning he arrived Byron stayed only long enough to have breakfast , then went on to the submarine ; but in that short time he unburdened with frank and deep bitterness of heart the gist of what had happened in Marseilles . The news that Natalie and her baby were caught in Germany horrified Janice . Automatically she defended what her sister-in-law had done , and tried to reassure Byron that it would all turn out well . But she feared Natalie was doomed . Watching him play with Vic in the garden before he left , she had to exert willpower not to cry . The instant mutual magnetism between the uncle and the child was poignant to behold . When Byron said he had to go , Victor clung to him with arms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Moray stayed around Pearl Harbor for several more weeks , most of the time out at sea in the training areas . When the submarine came into port Byron spent every other night at Janice 's cottage . The first time he remained aboard , Aster telephoned . Janice did not know what to do . She told him to come over , but not until after little Vic was asleep in bed . His visit was a failure . She was uneasy , Aster quickly discerned it , and after a couple of drinks he left without touching her . She saw him only once after that before the Moray left on patrol . When Byron told her that they were sailing in the morning , she said , " Oh ! Well , why do n't you ask Carter to come to dinner , then ? He 's been awfully kind to me and Vic . " " That 's nice of you , Jan . Can he bring a girl ? " " If he wants to , sure . " Aster brought no girl . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of wine and working up to a jolly mood . Byron 's spirits were improving with his return to submarine duty . Aster 's correct mixture of informality and aloofness won Janice 's gratitude . At one point they turned on the radio for the war news , and heard that the Germans had at last surrendered at Stalingrad . They opened another bottle of wine on that . " There go the Krauts , " Byron said , lifting his glass , " and none too soon . " To his wine-flushed mind , this news signalled the early deliverance of his family . " Damn right . Now we get the Japs , " said Aster . When the evening was over and Janice was left alone , her head reeled with wine , and she was feeling in delighted girlish confusion that the death of her husband was behind her , and that she truly loved two men.  |p588TRANSLATOR  'S NOTE : General von Roon 's discussion of Stalingrad concludes the strategic analysis section of World Holocaust . The original book sketches all campaigns and battles to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this subsequent ground is covered briefly , and with much more anecdotal interest , in the epilogue to Roon 's magnum opus : a personal memoir of his dealings the mounting collapse of Germanyon all fronts . My translation continues with excerpts from the memoirs , adding only Roon 's essay on the Battle of Leyte Gulf . I have taken some liberties with Roon 's writing on Stalingrad . Seen in isolation , the battle was a senseless five-month grinding of whole German armies to hamburger in a remote industrial town on the Volga . One needs the context of the 1942 summer campaign to grasp what happened there . But Roon 's Case Blue analysis is so fogged with names of Russian cities and rivers , and with German army movements , that American readers cannotget through it . So I have inserted some passages of " Hitler as Military Leader " to illuminate the picture , employing only the words of Armin von Roon , and I have tried to cut out as many confusing technical and geographicalreferences as possible .  --  V.H.Stalingrad fulfilled on the battlefield Spengler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was the Singapore of Christian culture . The true tragedy of Stalingrad is that it need not have happened . The West had the strength to prevent it . It was not like the fall of Rome , or of Constantinople , or even of Singapore : not a world-historical crushing of a weak culture by a stronger one . On the contrary ! We of the Christian West , had we but been united , could readily have repulsed the barbaric Scythiansp589out of the steppes in their new guise of Marxist predators . We could have pacified Russia for a century and changed its essential menacing nature . But this was not to be . Franklin Delano Roosevelt 's one war aim was to destroy Germany so as to win unimpeded rule of the world for American monopoly capital . Rightly he perceived that England was finished . As for the menace of Bolshevism he was either blind to it , or saw no way to eradicate it , and decided that Germany was the competitor he could destroy . The great Hegel has taught us that it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if one values the Christian civilizationnow being swamped by Marxist barbarism , Franklin Roosevelt was unquestionably one of mankind 's archcriminals . But in military history , one regards only how well the political aim of a war leader was achieved . Howevershortsighted Roosevelt 's aim , he certainly achieved the destruction of Germany . Sunset GlowOur second great assault on the Soviet Union , called " Case Blue , " * led to Stalingrad . It was an insightful concept , it was mainly Hitler 's , and it came close to success . Hitler himself ruined it . The contrast of Franklin Delano Roosevelt and Adolf Hitler in their warmakingis altogether Plutarchian . Spidery calculation versus all-out gambling ; steadfast planning versus impulsive improvising ; careful use of limitedarmed strength versus prodigal dissipation of overwhelming strength ; prudent reliance on generals versus reckless overruling of them ; anxious concern for troops versus impetuous outpouring of their lives ; a timid dip of a toe in combat versus total war with the last reserves thrown in ; such was the contrast between the two world opponents as they at last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both took power . In retrospect the world sees Hitler as the disgusting 1945 figure in the bunker : Roosevelt 's trapped victim , a distintegrating , trembling , unrepentanthorror lost in dreams , maintaining his grip on a prostrate Reich by sheer terror . But this was not the Hitler of July 1942 . Then he was still our all-masterful FUHRER : a remote , demanding , difficult warlord , but the ruler of an empire unmatched by those of Alexander , Caesar , Charlemagne , and Napoleon . The glow of German victory lit the planet . Only in retrospect do we see that it was a sunset glow . Case BlueCase Blue was a summer drive to end the war in the east . Our great 1941 drive , Barbarossa , had aimed to destroy the Red ArmyThe code name was altered to Braunschweig ( Brunswick ) during the campaign . This translation retains " Blue " throughout .  --  V.H.p590and shatter the Bolshevik state in one grand three-pronged summer campaign . We had tried to do too much at once . We had hurt the enemy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ animal ability to resist and endure . The Japanese unwillingness to attack Siberia  --  duly reported to Stalin by his spy Sorge from our embassy in Tokyo  --  had enabled the Red dictator to denude his Asian front and hurl fresh divisions of hardy brutish Mongol troops at us . These winter counterattacks , though halting us in the snows outside Moscow , had petered out . When the spring thaw came we still held an area of the Soviet Union roughly analogous to the entire U.S.A. east of the Mississippi . Who can doubt that under such an occupation the flighty Americans would have collapsed ? But the Russians are a different breed , and they needed one more convincing blow . Case Blue carried forward Barbarossa in its southern phase . The aim was to seize southern Russia for its agricultural , industrial , and mineral wealth . The theme was limited and clear : Hold in the north and center , win in the south . Granted that Hitler 's continental mentality could not grasp the Mediterranean strategy , it was the next best thing to do . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Moreover , it did not appear that we could fight the war to a finish without the Caucasus oil . Under all the muddled political verbiage of Hitler 's famous Directive Number 41 , rewritten by his own hand from Jodl 's professional draft , the governing concepts of Case Blue were : 1 . Straighten out the winter penetrations ; 2 . Hold fast , north and center , on the Leningrad-Moscow-Orel line ; 3 . Conquer the south to the Turkish and Iranian borders ; 4 . Take Leningrad , and possibly Moscow ; 5 . The main objectives in Russia thus achieved , if the enemy still fights on , fortify the eastern line from the Gulf of Finland to the Caspian Sea , and go on the defensive against an emasculated foe . Essentially then , the original Barbarossa goal now shifted to a slanting Great Wall of fortified positions from the Gulf of Finland to the great Baku oil fields on the Caspian , sealing off our " Slavic India . " Other vital benefits , if the campaign succeeded , would be cutting off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side , and denying our enemies Persian oil . An advanceto India might even be in the offing , if all went well , or a northward sweep east of the Volga to take Moscow from the rear . Admittedly , this was adventurous policy . We had failed once , and were trying again with weaker forces . But Russia was weakened , too . The whole grandiose drive of the German people under Hitler for world empire was only a pyramiding of gambles . If only we could change the war balance by seizing Russia 's wheat andp591oil , and then stabilize the eastern front , two political solutions of the war could open up : an Anglo-Saxon change of heart at the prospect of facing our full fury , or a realistic peace by Stalin . Roosevelt 's fear of such a separateeastern peace governed all his war-making . And Stalin remained suspiciousto the end that the plutocracies were planning to leave him in the lurch . It was uncertain right up to our surrender whether the bizarre alliance of our foes would not fall apart . Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only by lettingus win against Russia could the world flood of Bolshevism be stemmed ? Churchill at least wanted to land in the Balkans to forestall Stalin in middle Europe . If this was bad strategy , because we were too strong and the terrain too difficult , it was at least alert politics . Roosevelt would have none of it . Since he could not annihilate us , he wanted to help the Bolsheviks to do it . So he sacrified Christian Europe to American monopolycapital for a brief gluttonous feast , at the price of a new dark age now fast falling on the world . Answers to Critics of BlueAfter every war , the armchair strategists and the history professors have their pallid fun , telling those who bled in battle how they should have done it . Certain shallow criticisms of Case Blue have been repeated until they have taken on a false aura of fact . Stalingrad was a great and fatal turn in world history , and the record leading up to it should be clear . Strategically , Blue was a good plan . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day-to-day interference . Critics carp that the one acceptable objective of a major campaign is the destruction of the enemy 's armed forces . In the summer of 1942 Stalin had concentrated his armies around Moscow , assuming we would try to end the war by smashing the bulk of his forces and occupying the capital . Our critics assert we should have done so . This would indeed have been orthodoxstrategy . By striking south we achieved massive surprise . That too is orthodoxstrategy . TRANSLATOR 'S NOTE : Russian sources bear out Roon . Stalin was so positive that the attack in the south was a feint to draw off Moscow 's defenses , and he hung on to this idea so long , that only Hitler 's botch of the tactics saved Stalingrad , and possibly the Soviet Union .  --  V.H.We are also told that the strategic aim of Case Blue was economic , and therefore wrong . One must destroy the enemy 's armed force , then one canp592do as one pleases with his wealth ; so the banal admonition goes . These critics miss the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enforce a gigantic land blockade of the poor but governing north rump of the Soviet Union , by depriving it of food , fuel , and heavy industry . Blockade , if one can enforce it , is a tedious but tested way to humble an enemy . When Blue was planned , the Japanese were running wild in the Pacific and in Southeast Asia . We assumed that they would neutralize the United States for a year or more . Alas , the stunning early turnabouts at Midway and Guadalcanal freed Roosevelt to flood Lend-Lease aid to the Russians in 1942 , past our blockade . That made a powerful difference . Finally , critics contend that Blue 's double objective , Stalingrad and the Caucasus , required a stretching out of the southern front far beyond the capacityof the Wehrmacht to hold it , so that the outcome of the campaign was foredoomed . But Stalingrad was not an objective of Case Blue . It became Hitler 's objectivewhen he lost control of himself in September . Strategy of Case BlueNear Stalingrad , the rivers Don and Volga converge in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ V 's at each other over a forty-milespace of dry land . The first phase of Blue called for capture of this strategicland bridge , so as to block attacks from the north on our southern invasionforces ; also , to cut the Volga as a supply route of fuel and food to the north . At the V of the Volga , a medium-sized industrial town straggled alongthe bluffs of the west bank : Stalingrad . We did not need to occupy it , weneeded merely to neutralize it with bombardment in order to dominate thebottleneck . Our general plan was to thrust two heavy fast-moving pincersalong the two arms of the enormous V of the Don , thus trapping and destroyingmost of the Soviet forces defending south Russia . The first pincer , the Volga Force  --  jumping off first , since it had the longer distance to go  --  would march down the upper arm of the Don . The second , the CaucasusForce , would advance along the lower arm . They would meet between therivers , near Stalingrad . After defeating and mopping up the trapped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the second orconquest phase . The Caucasus Force would wheel south , cross the Don , and drive down to the Black Sea , to the Caspian , and through the highpasses to the borders of Turkey and Iran . The Volga Force would defend thedangerous flank opened up all along the Don , which would be manned duringour advance by three satellite armies : Hungarian , Italian , and Rumanian . Here was the weak link in Blue , and we knew it . But we had already lostnearly a million men in the war , and we were near the limit of German manpower . We had to use these auxiliaries on the flanks while the Wehrmachtp593struck ahead . But we did not plan that they should man the Don against a full assault by the Red Army . That happened only because the Filhrer lost his head , and disrupted the timetable of the campaign . TRANSLATOR 'S NOTE : In editing Roon , I have omitted Manstein 's conquest of the Crimea and Sevastopol , and the failure of Timoshenko 's May attack against Kharkov . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making Blue a much more promising operation . I have called " Army Group A " Caucasus Force , and " Army Group B " Volga Force . The technical Wehrmachtdesignations are hard to follow , especially as regroupings occurred in mid-campaign.  --  V.H. ( From " Hitler as Military Leader " ) What Went Wrong . . . Supreme Headquarters is an edgy place during a campaign . One waits in a map room for developments , day after day . The war seems to drag and drag . Out in the field is reality : hundreds of thousands of men marching over fields and through cities , moving masses of equipment , coming under fire . In Headquarters one sees the same faces , the same walls , the same maps , one eats in the same place with the same elderly tired men in uniform . The atmosphere is strained and quiet , the air stale . There is a remotenessand abstraction about this nerve center of the war . The perpetual tension of deferred hope gnaws at the heart . At our advance headquarters at Vinnitsa in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " as Hitler named the installation , was a crude compoundof log cabins and wooden huts in the open pine country near the southern River Bug . Socially , there was no relief . Physically , we could go splash in the slow muddy river , if we cared to expose our naked skins to clouds of stinging insects . The weather was blazing hot and sticky , too much so for Hitler even to walk his dog , his only exercise . We moved there in mid-July , at the height of the campaign . Hitler did not take the heat well , strong sunlight bothered him , and altogether it was an uncomfortable situation . His digestion was worse than ever , his flatulencea trial for everybody in a room with him . Even the dog , Biondi , was out of sorts and whiny . But even before that , while we were still in our cooler and more comfortablecompound in the East Prussian woods , he had already shown signsp594of strain and instability , by his drastic change of plan for the Caucasus Force and for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ World Holocaust ) The faltering of Blue can be dated precisely to the thirteenth of July . Hitler 's anxiety had been mounting day by day . He could not understand why we were not hauling in the hordes of prisoners that our great envelopingmovements had yielded in 1941 . Whether Stalin had learned at last not to order his troops to stand fast and be captured ; or whether the southernarmies were fading away before us in undisciplined rout ; or whether the front was just weakly manned ; or whether , finally , the Russians were resortingto their classic tactic of trading space for time , the fact was we were capturingRussians in the tens of thousands , instead of the hundreds of thousands . On July 13 , Hitler suddenly decided to divert the entire eastward campaignaway from the Stalingrad land bridge , southwest toward Rostov ! Thus he hoped , by a tighter enveloping move , to bag a supposed enormous Red Army force in the Don bend . The whole Caucasus Force wheeled off on this mission . He even peeled off the Volga Force 's panzer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward Rostov , too , although Halder bitterly opposedpiling so much armor against one minor objective . The Volga Force slowed to a standstill , very low on gasoline , for the main supplies had to go to this adventure of catching Russians . The huge power thrust captured Rostov and netted some forty thousandprisoners . But precious time had been lost , and the whole Blue plan was in disarray . The Caucasus Force and the Fourth Army were milling around Rostov , choking the transit arteries , and creating unimaginable difficultiesin improvised organization and supply . At this critical point Adolf Hitler sprang on our stupefied Headquarters his notorious and catastrophic Directive Number 45 , perhaps the worst militaryorders ever issued . It abrogated the Blue plan altogether . A responsible General Staff would have analyzed , war-gamed , and organized such an operation for months , or even for a year . Hitler airily scrawled it all out in a day or two , and so far as I know , all by himself . If Jodi helped him with it , he never boasted of it ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : 1 . A mere assertion ( contrary to known fact ) that the first aim of the campaign had been achieved : i.e. , that the Red Army in the south had been " largely destroyed . "  |p5952  . The Volga Force was to resume the drive toward Stalingrad , with the Fourth Panzer Army rejoining it. 3 . The Caucasus Force under List was to proceed southward at once , with additions to its original difficult task , such as securing the entireBlack Sea coast . This was Hitler 's last attack directive . It was at this point that we at Supreme Headquarters began to lose heart , though in the field things still looked rosy . Haider , the Army Chief of Staff , was scandalized . He noted in his diary  --  and he said baldly to me  --  that these orders no longer bore any resemblance to military realities . The conditions for carrying out our summer campaign in any reasonable form had now melted away . Neither the upper bend of the Don , nor the crucial land bridge , had been secured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Don phase , had been scheduled to move south only when the Don flank stretching to Stalingrad was secure . Now the two great forces were to separate and operate in different directions with unsecured flanks  --  leaving a constantly widening gap between them as they pursued diverse missions ! Moreover , the Blue plan had called for Manstein 's Eleventh Army , which had conquered the Crimea and captured Sevastopol , to cross to the Caucasusand support List in his drive . But Hitler , in his glee at the capture of Rostov , had decided that things were going too well in the south to waste Manstein there ; and he had ordered Manstein to take most of his army eleven hundred miles north to attack Leningrad ! Hitler 's numbered directives end with Number 51 , dated late in 1943 ; but in fact , after this fatal Number 45 , they trail off in defensive measures . This was his final wielding of the initiative . Lack of experience , and the strain of arrogating to himself all the political and military authority of Germany , had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adept mind , and a fearsome will . The order was madness . Yet only in our innermost HQ councils was the picture clear in all its folly . The Wehrmacht obeyed , and marched off into the remotest depths of southern Russia on two separate roads to its sombre fate . Arrival at StalingradWith awesome inevitability , the tragedy now began to unfold . The Caucasus Force performed wonders , marching across vast steppes blazing with midsummer heat , climbing to the peaks of snowcapped mountainranges , investing the Black Sea coast , and actually sending patrols as far as the Caspian Sea . But it fell short of its objectives . What Hitler had orderedwas beyond its manpower , its firepower , and its logistical support . The force stood still for as much as ten days at a time , for want of gasoline , and of supply trucks to bring up the fuel . At one point , with true Greekp596irony , gasoline was even being brought to the Caucasus Force on the backs of camels ! List 's great armies stalled in the mountains , harried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Meanwhile , on August 23 the Volga Force , driving on toward Stalingrad , reached the riverbank north of the city , and the neutralization phase began with heavy air and artillery bombardment . Resistance was at first meager . For a day or two it looked as though Stalingrad might fall to a coup de main . But it did not happen . We were at a far stretch ourselves , and Stalingrad held against the first shock . TRANSLATOR 'S NOTE : These dry words of Roon scarcely convey the reality as the Russians saw it . The advance of the Sixth Army on Stalingrad was apparently the most terrifying event of what the Russians call the Great Patriotic War . The army commanders , the populace , and Stalin himself were astounded at this renewedpowerful thrust of the Germans into the vitals of their country . The August twenty-third bombardment was one of the most horrible ordeals by fire the Russians ever endured . Some forty thousand civilians were killed . The flaming streets of the town literally " ran with blood . " All communication with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believed that Stalingradhad fallen . But though the city was to undergo one of the worst punishmentsin the history of warfare thereafter , that was the low point . Most military writers conclude that if Hitler had not interfered with the Blue plan , the Volga Force would have reached the river weeks earlier , while Stalin was still under the delusion that the southern attack was a feint . Stalingrad would have fallen , a fruit of the massive initial surprise , and the whole war might have gone differently . Hitler disembowelled the Blue campaignby the diversion to Rostov.  --  V.H.Catastrophe at StalingradAs previously stated , the capture of Stalingrad was not a military necessity . Our aim was to take the land bridge between the rivers , and to deny the Soviets the use of the Volga as a supply route . Now we were at the Volga . All we had to do was invest the city and bombard it to rubble . After all , we investedLeningrad for more than two years . About a million Russians fell in Leningrad streets from starvation , and for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a withered corpse . There was no military reason not to treat Stalingrad the same way . But there was increasing political reason . For as the Caucasus Forcep597came to a halt in the wild mountain passes despite all Hitler 's savage urging ; as Rommel stalled at El Alamein , failed in two assaults , and at last underwentthe grinding assault of the British ; as the RAF increased its barbaricfire raids on our cities , slaughtering thousands of innocent women and children and pulverizing important factories ; as our U-boat losses suddenlyand alarmingly shot up ; as the Americans landed in North Africa with world-shaking political effect ; as all these chickens came home to roost , and Adolf Hitler 's great summer flush of triumph waned , and the first cracks in his gigantic imperium appeared , the embattled Fuhrer felt a more and more desperate need for a prestige victory to turn all this around . STALING RAD ! STALINGRAD , bearing the name of his strongest foe ! STALINGRAD , symbol of the Bolshevism he had fought all his life ! STALINGRAD , a city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the war ! The capture of Stalingrad became for Adolf Hitler an unbelievably violentobsession . His orders in the ensuing weeks were madness compoundedand recompounded . The Sixth Army , which with its mobile striking power had won an unbroken string of victories in Poland , France , and Russia , was fed division by division into the meat grinder of Stalingrad 's ruined streets , where mobile tactics were impossible . Slav snipers mowed down the veterans of the great Sixth in a house-to-house " rat war . " The Russian General Staff poured in defenders across the Volga to keep up this annihilation , while methodically preparing a stupendous counterstroke against the weak satellite armies on the Don flank . For Josef Stalin had finally grasped that Hitler , with his obsessive cramming of his finest divisions into the Moloch-maw of Stalingrad , was giving him a glorious opportunity . Late in November the blow fell . The Red Army hurtled across the Don into the Rumanian army , guarding the flank of the Volga Force , northwest of Stalingrad . These unwarlike auxiliaries gave way like cheese to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corps in our Fourth Panzer Army , on the southern flank . As the attack developed into December , the Russians smashed into our lines all along the Don where Italians and Hungarians were protecting the Sixth Army 's rear ; and a steel trap closed on three hundred thousand German soldiers , the flower of the Wehrmacht . ( From " Hitler as Military Leader " ) Transformation of Hitler . . . As it happened , I was away from Supreme Headquarters during much of this trying period , on a long inspection tour . When I left late in August , all was going well enough in Russia . Both forces were advancingp598rapidly on their diverging fronts ; the Red Army still seemed to be fading away , taking no advantage of the great gap opening up in our line ; and Hitler , though understandably tense and nervous , and suffering dreadfully from the heat , seemed in good spirits . I returned to find a shocking change at Werewolf . Halder was gone , fired . Nobody had relieved him . General List of the Caucasus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either . Hitler had assumed both posts ! Adolf Hitler was now not only head of the German State , head of the Nazi Party , and Supreme Commander of the armed forces ; he was now his own Army Chief of Staff , and he was in direct command of the Caucasus Force , stymied six hundred miles away in the mountains . And this was not a nightmare ; it was all really happening . Hitler was not speaking to Jodi , his erstwhile pet and confidant . He was not speaking to anybody . He was taking his meals alone , spending most of his time in a darkened room , brooding . At his formal meetings with the staff , secretaries came and went in relays , writing down every word ; and it was with these secretaries and nobody else that Hitler was conversing . The break with the army was complete . Gradually I pieced together what had happened . Halder 's objections to Hitler 's senseless pressing of the Stalingrad attack had at last resulted in his summary dismissal in September ; and so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staff officer who for years would talk up to Hitler , was gone . As for the pliable Jodi , the Fuhrer had sent him by plane to the CaucasusForce , to urge General List to resume the advance at all cost . But Jodi had come back and , for once in his life , had told Hitler the truth  --  that List could not advance until logistics improved . Hitler had turned nasty ; Jodi , in an amazing burst of spirit , had rounded on his master , reeling off all Hitler 's orders which had led to this impasse . The two men had ended screeching at each other like washerwomen , and thereafter Jodi had been barred from the great man 's presence . It was several days before I was summoned to appear at a briefing . I was quite prepared , even at the cost of my head , to give my report on the bad state of Rommel 's supply . As it happened , Hitler did not call on me to speak . But I will never forget the glance he fixed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , red-eyed , slumped in his chair with his head sunk between his shoulders , holding one trembling hand with the other , he was searching my face for the nature of my news , for a ray of optimism or hope . What he saw displeased him . He gave me a menacing glare , uncovering his teeth , and turned away . I was looking at a cornered animal . I realized that he knew in his heart that he had botched the Blue campaign , thrown away Germany'slast chance , and lost the war ; and that from all quarters of the globe , the hangmen were approaching with the rope.  |p599But  it was not in his nature to admit mistakes . All we heard , in the dreadful weeks that dragged on until the Sixth Army surrendered  --  and indeed until he shot himself in the bunker in 1945  --  was how we generals had failed him ; how Bock 's delay at Voronezh had lost Stalingrad ; how incompetentList was ; how battle nerves had incapacitated Rommel ; and so on without end . Even when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all he could think of was to promote Paulus to Field Marshal ; and when Paulus failed to kill himself rather than surrender , he threw one of his worst fits of rage . That ninety thousand of his best soldiers were going into captivity ; that more than two hundred thousand more had been hideously lost for his sake ; all that meant nothing to the man . Paulus had failed to show proper gratitude for promotion , by blowing his brains out . That upset Hitler . ( From World Holocaust ) Post MortemHitler would never allow the Sixth Army its one chance , which was to fight its way out to the west ; either early in the entrapment , when it might have broken out by itself , or in December , when Manstein at the head of the newly formed Don Force battled his way through the snow to within thirtyfivemiles of a join-up . Not once would he give Paulus permission to break out . The screeching refrain that echoed through Headquarters until Paulus surrendered was , " I wo n't leave the Volga ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but there was no " fortress , " only a surrounded and shrinking army . He boasted in a national broadcast , late in October , that he had actually captured Stalingrad , and was reducing pockets of resistance at leisure because " he did not want another Verdun , " and time was of no consequence . Thus he burned his public bridges , condemningthe Sixth Army to stand and die . Some military analysts now lay the disaster to Goring , who promised to supply the trapped Sixth Army at a rate of seven hundred tons of supplies a day . The Luftwaffe effort never reached two hundred tons , and Goring blamed the bad weather . Of course GOring 's promise was just a jig to his master 's tune . They were old comrades-in-arms . He knew what Hitler wanted him to say , so he said it , and condemned large numbers of Luftwaffepilots to useless deaths . Hitler never reproached Goring for this . He wanted to stay at the Volga until tragedy befell , and GOring 's transparent lie helped him to do it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hitler privately admitted to him that the Sixth Army was done for ; still it had to be sacrificedp600to protect the retreat of the armies in the Caucasus . What balderdash ! A fighting retreat from Stalingrad would have made far more sense . But the propagandist in Hitler sensed that a heartrending drama of a lost army might rally the people to him , whereas an ignominious swallowing of his boasts with a retreat would sully his prestige . On some such reasoning , he sacrificed a superb striking arm of battle-hardened veterans which could never be replaced . Roosevelt TriumphantFranklin Roosevelt 's proclamation at this time of the slogan " UnconditionalSurrender , " at the Casablanca conference in January , was in every way a masterstroke . Critics of the slogan  --  including the august General Eisenhower  --  fail to understand what Roosevelt accomplished with this thunderous stroke ; which , with his usual guile , he passed off as a casual remark at a press conference . In the first place , he drove home to the entire world , and above all to the German people , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The entire Global Waterloo turnabout was crystallized in those two simple words . This was in itself a stunning propaganda success . Secondly , he publicly signalled to Stalin an Anglo-American pledge against a negotiated peace in the west . No doubt Stalin remained skeptical , but it was as loud and powerful a commitment as Roosevelt could give him . Third , Roosevelt reassured the wavering nations like Turkey and Spain , and the subject peoples all over Europe , and the ever-veering Arabs , that the Western powers would not relax at the turn of the tide in Russia , and allow Bolshevism to sweep the continent and the Middle East . Fourth , he gave his own spoiled and soft nation , in its first moment of success against us , a clear and simple war aim , which appealed to its naive psychology , and discouraged notions of a short war or a compromise peace . It is objected that the German people were stiffened to resist to the last under Hitler 's leadership ; that Roosevelt should have appealed over his head to them and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an honorablepeace . This objection shows fatuous ignorance of what the Third Reich really was . Hitler had made Germany over in the only form he ever wanted ; a system of headless structures , including the army , with all power concentrated in himself . There was nobody to topple the Nazis . There was nobody to appeal to . Our national destiny was bound up with this man . This had been the one aim of all his actions since attaining power , and this he achieved . He was Germany . The armed forces were pledged to him with their sacred honor . The assassination attempt that failed in July 1944 was witlessp601and traitorous . I took no part in it , and I have never regretted that decision . It should have been plain to every general , as it was to me , that to order men to die in the field for a Leader , and then to murder this same Leader ( however unsatisfactory he might be ) was a betrayal of principle . More than once , at bad moments in Headquarters , I thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to shoot Hitler . But he knew he could rely on two pillars in the German character : Honor and Duty . The German people were in a tragic trap of history , condemned to fight for two and a half more fearful years , simply to keep alive the Head of State who had led them to destruction . Too late did we learn the fatal mistake of the Fiihrerprinzip . A monarch can sue for peace and preserve his nation 's honor and stability in defeat , as the Japanese emperor did . A dictator who fails in war is only a beleaguered usurper , who must fight on to the last like Shakespeare 's Macbeth , wading ever deeper in blood . Hitler could not step down ; and none of the Nazis could step down . Their secret massacres of the Jews had rendered that impossible . " UnconditionalSurrender " made not the slightest difference either to them or to the German people . Nothing could now sunder Hitler and the Germans , and put an end to the war , but Gotterdammerung . TRANSLATOR 'S NOTE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Caucasus Force , which follows the Stalingrad account , he calls " Epic Anabasisof Army Group A. " It is the longest essay in World Holocaust . I do not believe the American reader would be as interested in it as Roon 's German readers are . Essentially , once Paulus 's army surrendered at Stalingrad , the Caucasus Force faced a complete cutoff of their line of retreat . After considerabledithering , Hitler put the very able General von Manstein in charge of the northern and most threatened of these luckless armies , to pull him out of the mess . This Manstein did , with some brilliant maneuvering under the worst winter conditions . Another general , Kleist , led the retreat of the southern forces to a bridgehead on the Black Sea . In the end the Caucasus Force got out in good order , inflicting strong blows on the Red Army as it retreated ; and the Germans found themselves more or less back on the jumping-off line of Case Blue . It was a stupendously futile military exercise , thanks to Germany 's supreme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it up . A bitter name for the campaign gained currency in the Wehrmacht : the Caucasus round trip . " I had occasion to meet Hitler , so I know how plausible and even amiablehe could be , like a gangster boss ; he had all the forcefulness and cunningof a master criminal . But that is not greatness in my book . Hitler 's early " successes " were only the startling depredations of a resolute felon be/come a head of state and turned loose with the power of a great nation to back him up . Why the Germans committed themselves to him remains a historical puzzle . They knew what they were getting . He had spelled it all out in advance , in Mein Kampf . He and his National Socialist cohorts were from the start a gang of recognizable and very dangerous thugs , but the Germans by and large adored and believed in these monsters right up to the rude Stalingradawakening , and even long afterward.  --  V.H.p603FEBRUARY 20 , 1943 . BADEN-BADEN . . . . I shall never forget the moment when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large red swastika flag fluttered , and signs in German began appearing along the track . We were in the dining car , eating an abominable lunch of salt fish and rotten potatoes . The Americanfaces all around us were a study . I could hardly bear to look at my niece . She has since told me that she was already in such shock that she scarcely noticed the crossing of the border . So she says now . I saw then on her face the terror of a person being swept over Niagara Falls . For me it was not quite such a plunge . My memories of pre-Hitler Germanywere pleasant enough ; and during my brief reluctant trip to the 1936 Olympics to write a magazine piece , when swastikas were flying wherever the eye turned , I had encountered no problems beyond my own uneasiness . I knew some Jews who travelled in Hitler 's Germany on business , and a thick-skinned few for perverse pleasure . Nor were they at much risk . The German moves on tracks ; that is at once his virtue and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of tourism , as I was on the track of journalism , and therefore safe . I am counting much on this Teutonic trait . Even if the worst stories of German brutality prove true , we are on the diplomatic track . I can not see anti-Semitism jumping its track and harming us on this one , especially since we are being bargained off for Nazi agents , probably at a rate of four or five to one . All the same , in our first days here I did not draw a quiet breath . Natalie did not sleep or eat for a week . The defiant haunted gleam in her eyes when she held her son on her lap seemed not quite sane . But after a while we both calmed down . It is the old story , nothing is as terrifying as the unknown . The thing you have most feared , once it is upon you , is seldom as bad as imagined . Life here in Brenner 's Park Hotel is dismal enough , but we are used to it now and mainly bored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boredom oppressed me more in Baden-Baden , I shall have to reply , " Boredom , by a wide margin . " We are quarantined off from the local inhabitants . Our shortwave radios have been confiscated , and we hear no news except the Berlin broadcasts . Our only newspapers and magazines are Nazi publications , and a couple of French papers full of the crudest German lies , set forth in the language of Moliere , Voltaire , Lamartine , and Hugo . It is a prostitution worse than any poor French whore 's submission to the pumping and thumping of a hairy Hun . If I were a French journalist , they would have to shoot me before I would so stain my own honor , and the honor of my elegant language . At least I hope that is true . With so little to read , and no news , and nothing to do , all the Americans immured in Baden-Baden are deteriorating , myself perhaps more than others . In five weeks I have not written in this journal . I , who once prided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words as unfailingly as Anthony Trollope ; I , who have nothing else to do , and worlds to tell ; I have let this record slide like a schoolgirl who starts a diary , then slacks off and lets the almostempty notebook molder in a desk , to be found and giggled over by her own schoolgirl daughter twenty years later . But sound the trumpets ! The first Red Cross food packages came in yesterday , and everybody has snapped out of the doldrums . Canned ham ! Corned beef ! Cheese ! Canned salmon ! Canned sardines ! Canned pineapple ! Canned peaches ! Powdered eggs ! Instant coffee ! Sugar ! Margarine ! I love just writing down the words . These American staples are beautiful to our eyes , exquisite to our palates , reviving to our fading physiques . How on earth do the Germans fight a war on their everlasting black bread and potatoes and spoiled vegetables ? No doubt the soldiers get whatevergood food there is ; but the civilians ! Our ration , we are told , is fifty percentmore than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cellulose , but eating such food a dog could not thrive . I say nothing of the disgusting cookery in this famous hotel . The Swiss representative assures us that we are not being mistreated , that hotel food all over Germany nowadays is worse than ours . Another time I shall describe what we have been eating , the strange dining room arrangements , the wretched wine , the black-market potato schnapps , the whole way we live under our German " hosts . " It is all worth recording . But first I want to make up lost ground . It is eleven in the morning , and very cold . I am out on the balcony in pale sunshine , well wrapped up as I write . Those Red Cross proteins and vitaminsare coursing through my system , and I am myself again , craving the sun , the fresh air , and the moving pen . Thank God ! My digestion has been poor since we left Marseilles . In Lourdes I thought it was only nervous tension . But I was taken terribly ill on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been in grave disorder ever since . Yet today I feel fit as a boy . I have had ( ridiculous to set down , but true ) a gloriously normal stool , over which I felt inclined to crow like a hen over her egg . It is not just the nourishment , I am sure , that has worked such healing magic . There is something psychic to it ; my stomach recognizes American food . I could congratulate it on its sensitive politics . About Louis . He is the pet of the hotel . He grows in dexterity , vocabulary , and charm from week to week . He began to cast his spell over the group on the train . In Lourdes nobody had seen much of him ; but at the station someone gave him a fine toy monkey that squeaked , and he went toddling up and down the train , keeping his balance admirably as our car swayed , offering his monkey to people to squeeze . He was having such fun that Natalie let him roam . He quite broke up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to our uniformed Gestapo man , who hesitated , then took the monkey and unsmilinglymade it go Squeak ! It would require another treatise like Meredith 's on the comic spirit to explain why it was that everyone in the car burst out laughing . The Gestapo man looked around in embarrassment , then he laughed , too ; and the horribleabsurdity of the war seemed to strike us all , even him , for just that moment . The incident was talked about all over the train , and the little boy with the monkey became our first celebrity at the Brenner 's Park Hotel . I have given more space to a trivial incident than it perhaps warrants , to suggest the beguiling nature of the child . In my bouts of illness in recent weeks ( some have been severe ) one cardinal thought has kept me from sinkinginto apathy . I can not and will not go under until Natalie and Louis are safe . I will guard them to the death , if I must , and I will fight depression and illness to be able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on my few magazine pieces . The special treatment we are getting  --  this tworoomsuite on a high floor with a balcony , overlooking the hotel garden and a public park  --  can only be due to my literary standing , such as it is . Our lives in the end may hang on my jump , with a book-club selection , from academicobscurity to a name of sorts . There are many children in the group , but Louis stands out . He is a privileged imp , getting more and better food than the others from a master scrounger , the naval attache . When this man found out Natalie was a Navy wile , he was enslaved . They are quite close in an intimacy of ( I am certain ) antiseptic purity . lie brings milk , eggs , and even meat for Louis . He brought a Ikrrbiciclen electric hot plate too , and Natalie cooks on the balcony to dissipatep606the odors . Now he is coaxing her to take the role of Eliza in Pygmalion , which he wants to put on with the dramatic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of us play card games or anagrams . All in all , consideringthat we are on the soil of Hitler 's Germany , Natalie and I are living a strangely banal existence , like people on an endless cruise aboard a thirdrateship , forever seeking ways to kill time . Boredom is the repeating bass note of our days , fear an intermittent piccolo shriek . Our Jewish identity is known . The German Foreign Ministry man stationedhere in the Brenner 's Park has made a point of complimenting me on A Jew 's Jesus . In fact , he talked rather intelligently about it . At first I was appalled , but granted the thoroughness of the Germans , it now seems naive to have hoped that I would pass unnoticed . I am listed in The International Who 's Who , the Writers Directory , and various academic reference tomes . So far my Jewishness has made no difference , and my semi-celebrity has helped . Germans respect writers and professors . This must account for the assiduous medical attention I have been receiving . Our American doctor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my gastric troubles as " detentionitis , " his own facetious term for the malaise that afflicts our group . But in the third week I became so violently ill that he requested my hospitalization . So it was that at the Baden-Baden MunicipalHospital I met Dr. R . I will not write down his real name even in thisbothersome Yiddish-letter cipher . I must draw a portrait of Dr. R when I have more time . Natalie is calling me to lunch . We have given some of our precious Red Cross food to the hotel kitchen , which has promised to cook it up in style . We are to have corned beef hash ; at last , at last , a way to doctor up those infernal potatoes . FEBRUARY 21 . BADEN-BADEN . I was very ill last night , and I am far from recovered today . However , I am determined to keep writing this record , now that I have started again . Moving a pen across a page makes me feel alive . The hotel kitchen 's execrable bungling of the corned beef @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . How could a dish be simpler to prepare ? But it was burned , lumpy , cold , greasy , altogether odious . We have learned our lesson . Natalie , the attache , and I will pool our Red Cross food , and cook and eat it in our rooms , and to hell with the Boches . Others are doing it ; the aroma drifts in the corridors . The latest rumor is that the exchange and release will take place at Easter time , to show Germany 's civilized respect for religion . Pinkney Tuck himself has told me this is sheer wishful fantasy , but the rumor mill grindsp607on . The psychology of this group is fascinating . A novel as good as The Magic Mountain could be made of it ; pity I have no atom of creativity in me . If Louis were older he could well be our Thomas Mann , and possibly his acute little mind is recording more than we can discern . The mention of Easter reminds me that in my Lourdes entry I started the topic of my abortive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story , a stirring up of cold ashes . Still , since these pages , if they survive me , may be the last testament of my brief and insignificant passage through the world , let me scrawl out the main facts . They should take but a paragraph or two . I have already described my alienation from the Oswiecim yeshiva , the key to it all . I could not tell my father about that . Respect for parents was too deep in the grain for us Polish Jews . He was a lovable man , a dealer in farm implements , with a lively trade in bicycles . We were well-to-do , and he was pious and learned in an unquestioning way . It would have shattered him to know that I had become an epikoros , an unbeliever . So I went on being a star Talmud pupil , while laughing up my sleeve at Reb Laizar and the conformingyoung noddies around me . Our family doctor was a Yiddishist agnostic . In those days Jewish doctorsoften returned from the university smelling of pork . One day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Darwin 's book . Dar-veen , the yeshiva whisper went , was the very Satan of modern godlessness . Well , " Dar-veen " was hard going in German ; but I devoured The Origin of Species on the sly by candlelight , or away from the house by day . The first actual Sabbath violationof my life was carrying the Darwin book in my pocket down to the meadow by the river . Sabbath law forbids the bearing of burdens in " the public domain , " and a book counts as a burden . Strange to say , though in spirit I was already far from the faith , the physical deed of carrying that book out of my father 's house on Saturday was a terribly hard thing to do . Next , the doctor loaned me Haeckel , Spinoza , Schopenhauer , and Nietzsche . I raced through those books as adolescents do through pornography , with mixed feelings of appetite and shame , thumbing eagerly for the irreligious parts : sneers at miracles and at God , attacks on the Bible , and the like . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in green paper covers : Introduction to Science , and Great Modern Thinkers . Galileo , Copernicus , Newton , Voltaire , Hobbes , Hume , Rousseau , Kant , the whole radiant company burst on me , a fifteen-year-old Jewish boy lying alone on the grass by the Vistula . In a couple of weeks of feverish reading , my world and the world of my father fell in ruins : demolished , devastated , crumbled to dust , no more to be restored than the works of Ozymandias . So ow mind opened up . When my family came to the United States , I was the precociousp608wonder of a Brooklyn high school . I learned English as though it were the multiplication table , sped through the school in two years , and won a full scholarship to Harvard . By then my parents had seen me turn Yankee Doodlein speech , dress , and manners . They were proud of the Harvard scholarship , but fearful , too . Yet how could they stop me ? Away I went . At Harvard I was a prodigy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I was invited to wealthy people 's homes , where my yeshivaaccentedEnglish was a piquant novelty . I took all the petting as my due . I was a good-looking young man then , with something of Louis Henry 's unforcedcharm , and a great gift for conversation . I could make the Brahmins feel my own excitement in discovering western culture . I loved America ; I read prodigiously in American literature and history ; I knew most of Mark Twain by heart . My yeshiva-trained memory retained everything I read . I talked with a fluency of ideas and richness of allusion that the Bostonians found dazzling . I could spice my talk with Talmudic lore , too . In that way I stumbled on the perception that later made my name ; to wit , that Christians are fascinated when one presents Judaism to them , with dignity and a touch of irony , as a neglected part of their own background . Thirty years later I wrote my Talmudic Themes in Early Christianity , which metamorphosed into a best-seller with a catchier title , A Jew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next , and I shall be brief . Anyway , how repetitious life is ! What story is more threadbare than an infatuation between a wealthy girl and a poor tutor ? Comic operas , novels , tragedies , films abound on that simple plot . I lived it . She was a Catholic girl of a prominent Boston family . In one 's early twenties one is not wise , and in love one is not honest , not with others or with oneself . My own fluency of ideas and argumentation , turned in upon myself , persuaded me that Christ had come into my heart . The rest was simple . Catholicism was the true tradition , the treasurehouse of Christian art and philosophy ; and it was a strongly elaborated ritual system , the only sort of faith I really understood . I went through a conversion . It was a shallow dream . The awakening was ghastly , and I pass over it in silence . At heart , through all the instruction I remained  --  as I still remain  --  the Oswiecim yeshiva boy , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was shocked to his soul at seeing on the far wall the image of the crucified Christ , where in a synagogue the Holy Ark would be . If her family had not thrown me out , and if she had stood by me instead of liquefying in tears like a candy figure in the rain , I should still have lapsed . My essential condition for admiring , pitying , loving , and endlessly studying and writing about Jesus of Nazareth , as I have done , has been that I can not believe in him . According to the Nuremberg Laws , since all this happened belbrc 1933p609and I never did anything about " de-converting , " I may be technically safe from persecution as a Jew . The exemption , as I understand it , applies to German half-Jews , and as an American I might well get the benefit , too , if it came to that . When my passport problems grew sticky in 1941 , a good friend in the Vatican procured for me photocopies of the Boston documents that recorded my conversion . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet officially produced them , because I might in some way become separated from Natalie . That must not happen . If I can help her with them , I will . As for saving my own life  --  well , I have lived most of it . I shall not return to the Martin Luther book . I meant to round out , with this Reformation figure , my picture of Christ moving through history . But the coarse strident Teutonism of my hero was giving me greater and greater pause , quite aside from his diatribes against the Jews , indistinguishable from the bawlings of Dr. Goebbels . That he was a religious genius I do not doubt . But he was a German genius , therefore a destroying angel . Luther 's best brilliance goes to smashing the Papacy and the Church . His eye for weaknesses is terrifying , his eloquence explosive . His bold irreverent hatred of old institutions and structures sounds the true German note , the harsh bellow out of the TeutoburgForest , the ring of the hammer of Thor . We shall hear it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fanatic elements of each ; we shall hear it in Wagner 's music and writings ; and it will shake the earth in Hitler . Let other pens tell of what was great in Luther . I should like to write next some dialogues in the Platonic manner , ranging in the casual fashion of my Harvard conversations over the philosophical and political problems of this catastrophic century . I could contribute nothing new ; but writing as I do with a light hand , I might charm a few readers into pausing , in their heedless hurry after pleasure and money , for a look at the things that matter . Another rambling entry ! But I have done my six pages . I have been writing in great abdominal pain , clenching my teeth to get the words down . I shall find it hard to rise from this chair , I feel so weak and poorly . There is something gravely wrong with me . These are not psychosomatic spasms . Alarm thrills through my system . I shall certainly see the doctor again . FEBRUARY 26 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better than I did in the hospital . Actually , it was a relief to get away for three days from the boredom of Brenner 's Park Hotel and the smell of the bad food . The hospital jellies and custards went downp610well , though I am sure they were distilled by German inventive genius out of petroleum waste or old tires . I was put through every possible gastrointestinaltest . I still await the diagnosis . The hospital time passed quickly because I talked a lot with Dr. R He wants me to bear witness , when I return to the United States , that the " other Germany " lives on , shamed , silenced , and horrified by the Hitler regime ; the Germany of the great poets and philosophers , of Goethe and Beethoven , of the scientific pioneers , of the advanced social legislators of Weimar , of the progressive labor movement that Hitler destroyed , of the good-hearted common people who in the last free election voted by an increased majority against the Nazis ; only to be betrayed by the old-line politicianslike Papen and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had passed his peak , and brought on the great disaster . As for what ensued , he asks me to picture the Ku Klux Klan seizing power in the United States . That is what has happened to Germany , he says . The Nazi Party is an enormous German Ku Klux Klan . He points to the dramaticuse of fire rituals at night , the anti-Semitism , the bizarre uniforms , the bellicose know-nothing hatred of liberal ideas and of foreigners and so forth . I rejoined that the Klan is a mere lunatic splinter group , not a major party capable of governing the nation . Then he cited the Klan of Reconstruction days , a respectable widespread movement which many of the leading Southernersjoined ; also the role of the modern Klan in the Democratic politics of the twenties . Extremism , he says , is the universal tuberculosis of modern society : a world infection of resentment and hatred generated by rapid change and the breakdown of old values . In the stabler nations the tubercles are sealed off in scar tissue , and these are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , depression , war , or revolution , the germs can break forth and infectthe nation . This has happened in Germany . It could happen anywhere , even in the United States . Germany is sick unto death of the infection , the doctor says . Millions of Germans know it and are grieved by it . He himself is a Social Democrat . One day Germany will return to that path , the only road to the future and to freedom . German culture , and the German people as a whole , must never be condemned for producing Hitler , and for what he is doing to the Jews . The greatest misfortune of the Hitler era has befallen the Germans themselves . There is Dr. R ' s thesis . What of Hitler 's popularity with the Germans ? Well , he argues that terror , and total control of the press and radio , produce a mere simulacrum of popularity . But I wrote magazine pieces on Hitler . I know facts and figures . I know how the universities in a body went over to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man of destiny , how readily andp611enthusiastically the civil service , the business world , the judiciary , and the army swore allegiance to him . I said to the doctor that in future study of this insane era , the chief phenomenon to explain will be the almost general spiritualsurrender to Hitler of the German nation . If you call his movement a Ku Klux Klan , then all Germany overnight either turned Klansmen or cheered the Klan , as though liberalism , humanism , and democracy had never existed on this soil . His retort : the American mind can not comprehend the Germans ' predicament . They are imprisoned on a narrow patch of central Europe 's poorest earth , living for centuries under the pressure of the Russian threat , with France harrying them at their back . Their two great cultural foci , Prussiaand Austria , were trodden under the boots of Napoleon 's armies . England intrigued with czarist Russia for a century to keep the German people weak . This led to the ascendancy of Bismarck ; and because of his stubborn preservationof absolutism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Germanpeople remained politically immature . When the amorphous Weimar " system-time " began to fall apart in the Depression , and Hitler 's clear strong voice of command rang out , there was a reflex of energy and enthusiasm . Hitler played upon the best qualities of the nation to bring about an economicrecovery much like Roosevelt 's New Deal . Unfortunately his military successes , to a nation hungry for self-respect , swamped resistance to his evil tendencies . Were not the Americans themselves worshippers of success ? On my bed lay a copy of the Propaganda Ministry 's foreign-language magazine , Signal , with a long obfuscated account in French of the Stalingrad surrender . The story made it sound almost like a victory . Of course here in Baden-Baden one can not learn much about Stalingrad , but obviously it was a towering defeat , possibly the pivot of the war . Yet Signal declares it all went according to plan ; the sacrifice of the Sixth Army strengthened the eastern battle line and foiled the Bolsheviks ' campaign . Did Dr. R think the German people would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hitler grow now ? He commented that my very impressive historical insight did not extend to current military expertise . In point of fact the Stalingrad operation had stabilized the eastern front . His own son , an army officer , had written him to this effect . It was in any case irrelevant to the discussion of the nature and culture of the German people . It was very important to him , he said , that a man of my standing should grasp these ideas , for a time was coming when the world should be told them by a powerful literary voice . It has occurred to me that the doctor may be a Gestapo agent , but he does not strike me as such . His manner is immensely earnest and sincere . He is a big blond chap with thick glasses , and small eyes that peer with eager seriousness as he makes his points . He speaks in low tones , uncon/sciously looking over his shoulder now and then at the blank wall of my room . I think he has approached me in all ingenuousness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No doubt it does , and I believe he is part of it . Pity it counts for so little . FEBRUARY 27 . The tentative diagnosis is diverticulitis . The treatment : a special diet , bed rest , and continuous medication . Ulcers and similar digestive ailments have afflicted several other members of our group . One of the U.P . correspondents , a heavy drinker , was taken to Frankfurt last week under Gestapo guard for an operation . If my condition greatly worsens , I also could be sent to Frankfurt for surgery . Would this mean separation from Natalie ? I shall take that up with Pinkney Tuck . It must not happen , if I have to die here.  |p613SINCE  the day Miriam Castelnuovo arrived at the children 's home outside Toulouse , she has been a favorite of the director . In happier times long ago Madame Rosen  --  not married , not pretty , not hopeful  --  spent her vacations in Italy , loved Italian art and music , and once almost married a nice Italian Jewish man , who was too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miriam 's clear Tuscan speech brings back those golden days , and Miriam 's disposition is so sweet that Madame Rosen , who tries not to play favorites  --  the home was built for three hundred children , and more than eight hundred are jammed in now  --  despite herself rather dotes on this newcomer . It is the free play period before bedtime . Madame Rosen knows where Miriam probably is . The girl has a favorite herself , a little French orphan named Jean Halphan , barely a year and a half old . Jean resembles Louis Henry , above all in the way his large blue eyes light up when he smiles . While Miriam was still with her parents she never stopped talking about Louis . She soon ceased asking questions , because she saw that they saddenedher mother and irritated her father . But she endlessly reminisced , reliving her time with him , displaying a memory like a film library . Now that her parents are gone , and she has nobody , she has fastened on Jean . The little boy adores her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Madame Rosen finds them on the floor of Jean 's big dormitory room , carefully building blocks amid milling children . She chides Miriam for sitting on the cold floor , though both children are bundled up as though they were outside in the snow . The home has not yet received its meager fuel ration this month . What little coal is left must be used to keep the water pipes from freezing , and to cook the meals . Miriam wears the fringed red shawl MadameRosen gave her . It is so big it quite hides her face , but it is very warm . Miriam and Jean perch on a cot , and Madame Rosen talks to the girl in Italian . Miriam always likes that ; she holds Jean on her lap , playing with his hands , and making him repeat Italian words . This visit of Madame Rosen 's does not last long . She returns to the office , warmed and cheered to face her problcn ) s . They are the old administrative ones , many times magnified : overcrowding , shortages , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smallp614Toulouse Jewish community is almost gone , she is all but overwhelmed . Happily , the mayor of Toulouse is a kindly man . When matters get desperate , as they are now regarding fuel , medicine , bed linen , and the milk supply , she appeals to him . She sits at her desk to resume writing her letter , this time with dimmed expectations . The French friends of the Jewish children have become very wary of showing their sympathy . This wizened yellow-faced little woman in her late fifties , wrapped in a faded coat and a torn shawl , weeps as she writes . The situation seems hopeless when she puts it down on paper . But she must do something , or what will become of the children ? Worse yet , warnings have been chilling the remaining Jews in the area for a week : another action impending . Madame Rosen feels safe herself . She has an official position , and clear papers of native French citizenship . So far , only foreign Jews have been taken , though in the last action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is for the children . Nearly all the newcomers are foreigners . Hundreds of them ! For about a third she has no papers at all . They were dumped on her by the police ; the French government separates children from parents being deported to the east , and puts them anywhere . The Jewish orphanages are becoming swamped . The regulation seems humanely intended , despite the anguish for the torn-apart families , for horrible stories circulate about the east ; but why is so little provision made for the children ? And now supposing that in this new action , the police come and ask for the foreign tots ? Dare she claim she has no records of any child 's origin ? Or since that is so farfetched in bureaucratic France , can she plead that she burned her records in panic when the Allies landed in North Africa ? Shall she actually burn the records now ? Will that save the foreign waifs , or merely condemn the French-born children to be taken off with them ? Madame Rosen has no reason to believe that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard of such a thing , and the fact that they have been dumped on her argues that they are meant to be spared deportation . But the anxiety haunts her . It is about midnight , hitter cold , and she is folding the letter up with numbed fingers in the candlelight ( the electricity has long since gone off ) when she hears crashing knocks at the street door . Her office is close to the street . The knocks startle her out of the chair . Crash ! Crash ! Crash ! My God , all the children will wake up ! They will be frightened to death ! " Ouvrez ! Ouvrez ! " Loud coarse male shouts . " Ouvrez ! " SS Obersturmfuhrer Nagel has a problem too . A tremendous flap is going on : a quota unfilled , and a partly empty train scheduled to pass through Toulouse in the morning . The top SS man in Jew/ish affairs in Paris is in a gigantic rage , but there just are n't that many Jews left in this prefecture . They have melted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There is just no way to fill three entire freight cars . The Toulouse action so far has collected five hundred . The demanded count from Paris is fifteen hundred . Fortunately , the Toulouse police records show that the children and the staff here add up to nine hundred and seven Jews . Nagel has obtained permissionfrom Paris to pick them up , while a squad combs Toulouse for the balance needed ; any Jews , no protection applicable . So the SS lieutenant sits in a car across the street from the children 's home , watching the French policemenknocking at the door . Given half a chance , those fellows would report back with some lame excuse and no results . He will sit here until the police chief comes out and reports to him . The story Nagel has given the chief to tell is a good one . The occupation authority needs the building as a convalescent home for wounded German soldiers . Therefore the children and staff will be moved to a ski resort in the Tyrol , where all the hotels have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a school , a hospital , and many playgrounds ; and where thousands of children from the bigger camps near Paris are alreadysettled . In transporting Jews , standard procedure requires giving them some kind of reassuring story . Secret circulated instructions from Berlin emphasize that the Jews are very trusting , and eagerly believe any kind of flimsy official information . This greatly facilitates the processing of the Jews . The door opens , the police disappear inside . Lieutenant Nagel waits . He is on his third cigarette , very chilled despite his warm new greatcoat and wool-lined service boots , and he is nervously thinking of going over there himself , though the uniform may scare the Jew staffers , when the door opens again , and out comes the police chief . That fellow manages to stay nice and fat on French rations ; plenty of black-market fat on that belly . He comes to the car , and reports with very garlicky breath that it is all arranged . The staff people will pack their belongings , and the central records of the institution . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes the story more plausible . The children will he wakened at three , dressed , and given a hot meal . The police vans and the trucks will come for them at five . They will all be on the railroad station platlirrmat six . The Frenchman 's fat face in the pallid moonlight is expressionless , and when Lieutenant Nagel says , " Bon , " the drooping mustache lilts in a nasty sad smile . So all is well . The train is due at a quarter to seven , and at that hour most people of the town wo n't he up and about . That is a bit of luck , Nagel thinks , as he drives back to his apartment to catch a few winks before the morning 's business . Orders are to avoid arousing sympathy in the **32;5462;TOOLONG churches . The American Government . The Indian Government . Even the Nepalese keep threatening us . Luckily , we 've got the money to pay them off . " " From where ? " When in doubt , ask direct questions . " Pilgrims @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , all over the world . " Geraldine was not one to let from her bag the stray , the inconvenient cat . " Hardly millions . " I tried to recall some of Sapersteen 's research . Tens of thousands , perhaps . . . more than South Korea 's gift to human credulity could claim but fewer than , say , America 's order of dusky Moslems . Yet all the research figures showed large revenues , important investments , a constant tide of money going out but never , plausibly , coming in . Was there , somewhere , a billionaire who believed in Kalki , and paid the bills ? As Geraldine was not about to give anything away , I played a religiouscard . " Will these millions of believers be saved , too ? " " When the new cycle begins , all things will be new . Those who have purified themselves will go on , as always . They will be born again . A happy few will attend Vishnu in Vaikuntha . " Whenever Vaikuntha was mentioned , my attention span @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tall dark shining stone that stood by itself in a field . Geraldine bowed to the stone . She hummed a mantra . I took a good look and saw that the rock had been carved into the shape of a phallus . " Oh , " I said . " It is the linga . The emblem of the god Siva . " Geraldine frowned . I was eager to show off my reading from Hindu Mythology . " Siva is one of three aspects of the one god who is three . " My grandfather Hecht was a rabbi , very Orthodox . " The Trinity ! " he used to whisper . " What hard work to think that one up ! " He always whispered when he mentioned Christianity . He thought that the Cossacks were just around the bend , even in San Diego . He died shortly after my parents converted to Christian Science . I am convinced that the Trinity in white smocks and armed with hypodermic needles was . . . were ? too much for him . He had been born @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but could not endure the sun . 1 lc moved hack to Ohio . Where he died . In Dayton . Why Dayton ? I do n't know . Thep71Wright brothers came from Dayton . He had been a widower most of his life . " Siva sprang from the forehead of Vishnu . He is blue-necked , horrible , divine , moon-crested , three-eyed . " Geraldine recited some of the traditional epithets used to describe Siva . I was fairly certain that she was not putting me on . " Who , " I asked , " is more important , Vishnu or Siva ? " " Vishnu ! " Geraldine looked grim . " He must be ! " And that was all that she would say . I noted the urgency of the " must . " Obviously there was some sort of competition between Vishnu-Kalki and Vishnu-Siva . But . . . no hindsight . For the first time I found Hinduism attractive . Well , moderately attractive , and basic . I liked the idea of depicting as god human genitalia . Christians had done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the penis , the son was the scrotum , the holy ghost was the ejaculation . Jews did not go in for that sort of thing . In the Old Testament sex was only for kings , and reproduction . There were no images . For us , there was nothing graven except , most dangerous of all , the word . THE NEXT DAY I WENT TO THE ASHRAM . I ASKED TO SEE KALKI . NOTavailable . Geraldine ? The same . Lakshmi ? She had left a message for me . Would I join one of the morning classes ? I did , gloomily . A class full of young and interchangeable Americans . They all had the same set smile ; and stared at you with the same unseeing pair of uninhabited eyes . They were like androids , waiting to be switched on . Instinctively , they seemed to know that there were altogether too many where they came from . Yes , the seventies were a perfect time to start a religion . If you arc horn knowing that you don'tp72really exist , that there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any god  --  fill up the empty space . While om-ing in unison with the others , I kept my sanity by staring out the classroom window and so was able to observe the arrival of the CBS television crew with their cameras , lighting and sound equipment , air of importance . Everyone was excited , and pleased . Even the Nepalesepolice were smiling , delighted by this invasion from the twentieth century . Mike Wallace wore a brown suit , a yellow shirt , a dark tie . He carried a clipboard . He was talking to the director or the producer of the program . All in all , I decided that it would not be a good idea for us to meet . The night before , I had talked to Morgan in New York . " The second piece is a lulu ! " Morgan actually said things like " lulu . " " We 've gone and beat CBS to the punch . Keep it up , Teddy . " I told him that I might be able to keep it up better if I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He thought that very funny . Anyway , 6o Minutes had been aced . Although I seldom watched television , I did enjoy Wallace . Odd cultural note in re television : those who did a lot of it , seldom watched any of it . Arlene was an exception . She watched all day long . But then she drank at the same time . Even so , she had her preferences . She was a loyal fan . She had known Wallace in the fifties and thought him sound ; that is , conservative . The only important row that Arlene and I ever had was when she made a television commercial for a presidential candidate called Ronald Reagan . As my head began slowly to dissolve from om-ing , a girl tiptoed into the classroom . " Lakshmi will see you , " she whispered . " Go to the Room of the Goddess . " The Room of the Goddess was Lakshmi 's inner sanctuary . Only a select few were allowed to attend her there . The room itself was undistinguished except for an ancient bronze @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relieved to discover , the regulation set of arms and legs . Hindu gods tend to busyness . Lakshmi was curled up on a cushion between two charcoal-burning braziers . It was a nippy day . " We 've been neglecting you . And I 'm sorry . " I melted . I was constantlymelting in the Iliinalayas . I attributed my condition to thep73altitude . This could explain my love of flying . Altitude , speed . Gravity escaped . Earth transcended , and denied . " I find the classes interesting . " I lied , as one who loves . " Geraldine told you our . . . plan . " Lakshmi was not entirely at ease , which was appealing . " Yes , she made me an offer . Price was not mentioned . " I am good at business . Lakshmi was not . " This is not just a job . It is a life . It is also a future life . " " But I 'm not exactly a believer . " Should I call her Lakshmi . I decided not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be . " There was no nonsense about that . She sounded eerily confident . " Are you so convinced of Kalki 's persuasiveness ? " " In a way . " Lakshmi smiled . Then she played atomic bomb to my unsuspecting Hiroshima . " The world will end on April 3 . " Lakshmi was matter-of-fact . H.V.W. would have had her voice tremble or even go shrill . But she was composed . It was as if she had just given me the date of a party she wanted me to come to . " I was n't supposed to tell you that . Please do n't tell your newspaper . I 'm taking a chance . But then I 'm assuming that you 'll join us . There 's not much time left . Only a few weeks . " " When you say the world will end on April 3 , " I always cling to the hard fact , if there is one , " do you mean there will be a nuclear explosion ? " Hiroshima , mon amour . " War ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't . All I know is that he wants you with us at The End . And after . " Through the thick stone walls , we could hear the CBS television crew as they set up their equipment . " I need more power ! " someone shouted . Who does not , I thought . I am physical , not metaphysical . Logic is my strongest point . I can usually see any argument 's flaw . I saw this one 's . " Should the world really end , what is the point of my taking this job ? I 'll be dead along with everyone two days after April Fools ' Day . " This is not an April Fool , " said Lakshmi . " The Iron Age will end , which means that the world we know will end , except for a few . Kalki has decided . "  | " Except for a few . " Even now , that phrase sounds and resounds in my head . This was the first clue . I fished : " If there are survivors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fire wo n't be nuclear . " " What fire ? " " I thought that the age of Kali would end in fire . " But Lakshmi did not rise to this or to any other proffered bait . She simply sat there on her cushion ; and waited . " If what you say is true , I 'd like to survive . Naturally . But I am not a believer in endings . Things always go on . There is only change . How much will Kalki pay me to be his personal pilot ? " " Whatever you ask . " " A contract that will be binding after April 3 ? " I made my little joke . Lakshmi made hers , as it turned out . " Yes , " she said . We left it at that . Together we went down to the courtyard where the taping was about to begin . Wallace and the producer stood next to a dais . They were going over notes . Nearby a diesel generator had been installed . Energy was in short supply almost everywhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the producer . " He 's in make-up , " said the director . He was staring through a viewfinder at the door through which Kalki would make his entrance . " He 'll be here in a minute . " The director was tall , and very blond . He was about my age , maybe younger . He wore horn-rimmed glasses ; red , white and blue sneakers . He had large red hands . I remember everythingfrom that day . In close-up . In slow motion . On wide screen . With stereophonic sound . I am now not consciously selecting details . They select themselves . I just put them down . Lights were turned on . The red brick wall of the ashram glowed . A sound man put on a set of earphones ; then he twisted the dials of the recording equipment . I turned to Lakshmi , to tell her that I thought I had met the director before . But Lakshmi was gone . She came and went , like that . Mike Wallace cleared his throat . The door beside the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Everyone stopped talking , moving . . . breathing ? For a moment , he stood in the doorway . He seemed afire in the yellow robes . The eyes were startling ; not only for their amazing blueness but because they had the unusual quality of seeming not to reflect but to generate light . " Pranam , " said Kalki . As he gestured , the ruby bracelet sprayed fieryp75particles in all directions like the promised fire . Wallace joined Kalki at the door . They talked in low voices . I tried to listen ; heard nothing . Then the director said , " O.K. Places every-body . " Kalki went inside the ashram , and a man with a clapboard stood between the camera and the door . " Start rolling , " said the director . The man with the clapboard declaimed in a high self-conscious voice , " Kalki interview . End of the world . Take one . " As the man stepped out of the camera 's range , Wallace stepped into the lights . " Cue Kalki ! " shouted the director @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the doorway . Again he said pranam . Again the ruby flashed . Again the eyes were a source of light . Kalki sat on the dais , and Wallace sat on a stool beside him . The interview began . Unfortunately , I was not able to hear what was said . But I could tell that Kalki was cool and serene while Wallace looked ill-at-ease . It was as if a mischievous decorator had placed a wooden Indian next to a golden Buddha . The taping ended . Kalki and Wallace went inside the ashram . I was about to go look for Lakshmi when the director turned to me and said , " Hi , Teddy ! Remember me ? I was technical director on The Mike Douglas Show . In Philly , you remember ? " I remembered . Again I was melting . I think , now , that I was having a nervous breakdown in Katmandu . First Lakshmi . Then Geraldine . Now a man , wearing horn-rimmed spectacles , red , white and blue sneakers . Seven years earlier I had chatted with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Philadelphia promoting Beyond Motherhood . Now here we were together , atop the world , and I was in heat . " I had a drinking problem then , " he announced . Yet I had showed no more than polite interest in him . Perhaps he had sensed my unfocusedlust , no , hysteria . I tried not to howl as he continued to drone , " Nearly lost my job . Peggy left me . Took the kids . Now I 'm Alcoholics Anonymous . " While he talked , he kept looking at me , lecherously , which naturally turned me off , so sweetly are we made . A bird in hand is no bird at all , though the hush burns . " I read your first interview with Kalki . It was swell . But they were pretty upset at CBS . This was going to he their first . You know what I miss the most ? Beer . Draft beer.  |p76Funny  , because I never drank the stuff before I was A.A. " " Try ganja . " " I did . Last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only into what 's wet . Let 's have dinner tonight . I 'm at the Ananda , too . " I cooled his ardor with briskness . Brusqueness , too . I asked if 6o Minutes was interviewing anyone other than Kalki for the program . " No . He 's the whole show . For his segment , that is . He 's quite a performer . I got a hunch that when New York sees what we got today , this segment 'll run maybe ten , ten and a half , maybe eleven minutes , you know , an in-depth study like the one with the Queen of England . " That night I went to bed early , carefully avoiding the CBS crew ; the director with sneakers . The telephone rang twice . I let it ring . I had a good cry . What , I wonder , is a bad cry ? The next morning when I was told that Kalki wanted to fly , I hit some sort of emotional peak . Because I wanted to fly . To break barriers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kalki wore his yellow robes . Otherwise there was nothing at all exotic , much less godlike about him . He looked a bit like pictures of the young Lindbergh who , of course , looked like the young Amelia whom I resemble , in the darkest way . We look for reflections of the self in the other . I asked him if he had enjoyed the interview with Mike Wallace . " It was necessary . " He was offhand . " For your work ? " " For the human race . At this point I must be seen by all , heard by all . They must be able to prepare . " Kalki banked to port . " If you want a contract , " he said , " I will give you a contract . " But he grinned when he said this , as if the world really was coming to an end and we were just playing games . Circling illegally over Chinese air space , I changed the course of my life  --  of history , too . " All right , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem surprised at my decision . " I want you to go back to the States tomorrow . " " I thought you were hiring me as a pilot . " " I am . But I have other work for you to do . " " Such as ? " " I want you to keep on with this story about Inc . ' I'Ilat way you'llp77be in a position to find out what people are saying about me , what they 're doing . " " You mean the narcs ? " " You 'll know what I mean . " That was that . We spent two hours in the air . I was in a marvelous if too volatile state . As I circled Mount Everest , I was perfectly happy . Whether Kalki was god or a con man made no difference . We were at the top of the sky . I even felt good when we came down , and I turned the plane over to the maintenance crew . The dented Cadillac was already on the runway . Kalki said something to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kalki stretched his legs , shut his eyes , appeared to sleep . Half an hour later the driver turned off the main road and drove us through dark woods to the bank of a fast-running stream , where he parked the car . Across the water , several hundred men and women in bright clothes stood , expectantly , around a smooth old altar . They paid no attention to us . Kalki was now awake . " What are they doing ? " I asked . " You 'll see . " A procession appeared from the woods . Men in scarlet and saffron robes were dragging a goat by a metal chain . Someone beat a drum , at random . A tall thin yellow man blew what looked to be a conch shell , a loud discordant honk . I looked at Kalki . He had gone rigid , legs still outstretched . Afraid that he was epileptic , I looked in my handbag for something to put between his teeth , to keep him from biting his tongue . I had a cousin who was epileptic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proudly , keeling over , with froth at his lips . But Kalki was merely in some sort of trance , and I put away my comb . Two men placed the goat on the altar . The goat tried to kick free of the ropes that bound its legs . Animals know . I shut my eyes . Then opened them again just as a priest slit the goat 's neck with a knife . The crowd dipped rags into the fresh blood that gushed upon the stone altar . Again the horn sounded and the drum was struck . Kalki came out of his trance . He said something in Sanskrit or Hindi . Then he tapped on the window that separated us from the driver , and the car started . He turned to me . " I have accepted the sacrifice . " " It was grisly , " I shuddered . " I ought to give up meat . I hate howp78we treat animals . How we betray them . We look after them . We feed them . We treat them like pets . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end ? " " But this was ritual . " " I do n't like blood . " " You are blood . That 's what these people know , and you do n't . For one instant , they were in a proper relation to the universe . " " Which is about to end . " " The cycle , yes . The universe , no . " How shall I write the rest of what happened that day ? I have no fear of flying , to make the obvious play on the title of a typical woman 's book of the seventies , a period when Jewish princesses became queens of popular fiction just as the Jewish princes had reigned as kings in the decade before . But I am once removed from Jewry by the antiseptic Christ Scientist . I can not use the tricks of my sisters . They were interested in freeing themselves of the stereotypes of Jewish princessdom , which they confused with all womanhood . This is not unnatural . We start with ourselves . We have no choice . But then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not move at all . They told us that they were telling it like it is . Then played it like it always was . They would have men the way men ( they thought ) had women . Boldly . Without feeling . Aiming always for the big 0 , and nothing else . The way , curiously enough , I almost always dealt with men , except those first weeks with Earl Jr . at USC . I fell in love with him , not knowing that that was not the normal thing to do . What is normal ? What can be described . Whatever love was , I felt it ( or , more to the point , thought that I felt it ) for Earl Jr. , and married him , and was happy never after . But then my tendresse is reserved for my own sex , as nature intended . In the beginning women spent most of their time together , back at the cave , raising children , making clothes and dinner , inventing the wheel and fire . While the women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and bonding . Oh , that male bonding ! But then we had our own kinds of bonding , too . We were the special ones . And we have known it from the egg . After all , it was a woman who first made the connection between her own cycle and that of the moon . It wasp79a woman who realized that if her cycle was that of the moon 's , then the moon must follow obediently the coursing of woman 's blood . So from uterus to sky would go the command : wax moon , wane moon . Raise the tides and lower them . In the womb all fetuses begin as female . Maleness is an afterthought . Close to the end , things were confused . Women wanted " liberation . " Of the sort that I had made for myself . In their " fictions " Jewish princesses tried to become Jewish princes . The result was not erotic . They tried to describe the genitals of men in the same way that they thought that men described those of women . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who feared flying tended to race blindly through zipless fucks . The masculine image was dealt with and done with in sentences that never rang true because sex itself never interested these ladies . How could it ? Only they themselves interested themselves . As a result , the only time their sentences would wriggle with life like so many electric eels was when they felt obliged to describe , in detail , their own personal charms . Beginning . with voluptuousbodies , exquisitely depilated ; ending with piquant faces , nosebobbedand teeth-capped . After the obligatory inventory of beauty , it was time to nosh . Never have so many dreadful dinners been described in such sensual detail . Where the true shape of a scrotum was not possible for them to describe upon the page ( how can you describe what you can only look at without seeing ? ) , the preparation of a shrimp remoulade , a lobster salad ( defiantly the princesses gorged on nonkosher delicacies ) , a sumptuouscasserole served on Royal Crown Derby , by candlelight  --  yet . I am taking my time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a satisfactory way of describing the sexual act . H.V. Weiss was a devotee of the pre-princess technique a.k.a. the Hemingway earthmovedsyndrome . There is a good deal of that in Beyond Motherhood , a book I have never been able to read straight through . Except for the descriptions of flying , it is Weissean and of no merit . I shall not describe Kalki 's genitals . That is a major decision . The princesses would think this a cop-out . I will note that he was not circumcised . At the time I wondered if this was a sign of godhood . Certainly the reverse was a sign of Judco-Christian godhood as opposed to the I lindu creative principle which requires an ui mutilated male.  |p80As  far as I could tell he had not shaved his chest . The single tuft of hair was authentic . Like Lakshmi he smelled of blondness , which always attracts us darknesses . How would I rate him as a lover ? In the last days of Kali the male performance was constantly being measured on a scale that tended precipitously to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what he was doing took me into account . This is rare with men , or so I 've found . It is common with women ; hence , that love known to my rabbinical grandfather as " Sapphic . " He liked to use Greek words to describe the sexual perversions of the goyim . If he could see me now ! Or even then , as we lay side by side on a blanket that Kalki had ( thoughtfully ? ) found in the back of the car , which was parked near the temple that Geraldine and I had visited . The driver was inscrutable . I pulled up my trousers . Kalki pulled down his robe . I laced my boots . He slipped on his sandals . It was chilly , though the sun was shining and there was not a cloud in the sky . " Well , " I said . And left it at that . " Contented ? " God granting favors was not so different from man giving , graciously , of his virile energy . " Why not ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's cold here . " " That pond ... " " Sprang from your big toe . Geraldine told me . " Kalki pushed the golden curls out of his eyes . Yes , he appealed to me . Even so , at the glorious moment some seconds after entry when like a great sneeze my body shook with uncontrollable ecstasy ( oh , Weiss , what have you done to my word-maker ? ) , I thought not of the sweating smooth blondness that held me in wiry arms but of Lakshmi , receiving what I was receiving . I was Lakshmi , for an instant . And happy . " You do n't believe in me . " Kalki was more sad than irritated . " No . " Better to be honest . " Well , you will . In time . " " What about Lakshmi ? " This was stupid of me . But women do that sort of thing . Darken the mood . Presage calamity . Not that I was in love . But he might have been . I am writing nonsense . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more or less than the Himalayan effect . I was susceptible . I was also in heat . He was in rut . Most men are most ofp81the time or so they think , which is the same thing . Even before I read Kate Millett , I hated D.H . Lawrence . " Lakshmi is my wife , forever . " Not even H.V.W. would have had a character make such a statement . On the other hand , the sentiment would have been bobbing around in the stew of his worn phrases . " Lakshmi is my wife , forever . " Kalki meant that literally . . . assuming that he was god , which I was not about to assume that cold bright afternoon beside the alleged source of the River Ganges . " I do n't know why I mentioned her . I 'm sorry . " " Which do you like best , men or women ? " All men want to know this , confident that you will say men . " Women , " I said , half-lying . " But each case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before . " I teased him . He took it well . Hand in hand we walked back to the car by way of the Siva phallus . Kalki murmured something as he passed the dark shining stone . " What did you say ? " Kalki grinned . " I was talking to myself . That is , to one of my selves . Are you ready for The End ? " I stopped . Up ahead was the shrine to the Buddha . The long red and gold banners were snapping in a wind from the northeast , I noted . Force of habit . I have an inner barometer . Can predict weather with some accuracy . " No , " I said , " I want to go on . " " Everything goes on . But in a different form . " " I 'd like to stay in this form as long as possible . " " Perhaps you will . " " Lakshmi said that a few will survive . Is that true ? " Kalki nodded . He seldom looked at you when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of how you are going to end the . . . cycle ? " " Ca n't you see the signs ? " He did not answer me directly . " The airis poisoned . The water is poisoned . The people ... " " The people reproduce geometrically , agricultural resources increase mathematically , if at all . I had a chapter on that in Beyond Mother-hood . " " Then you can see that the human race is in its terminal phase . Well , I have come , as prophesied , to purify . " " And to destroy ? "  | " The age of Kali is the age of iron . The age of iron is the age of evil regnant . So it will end , with me , astride a white horse , which will be the trick of the week because I 'm scared shitless of horses . " We both laughed at that . There was not much else to laugh at . " God should be able to ride a horse , or do anything else he wants to do . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wear James J. Kelly 's body . I am limited by his flesh . How did you like him , by the way ? " " Nice , " I said , meaning it . " His body liked yours . " Kalki smiled . " But no woman has to be told that . On the way back to the ashram , we resumed our previous relationship : interviewer with evasive celebrity . I asked him about Dr. Ashok . " Dr. Ashok is a man of parts . And plays them to the hilt . " " Is he CIA ? " " If that is what he plays . " This was no answer . " Jason McCloud . " " A narc . " That was an answer . " Do you deal in drugs ? " " Would I tell you if I did ? " " I do n't know . You might trust me , now that I 'm an employee . " " You are also working for Morgan Davies of The National Sun . " " I know when you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kalki was not pleased . " Lakshmi told you ? " " Yes . She wanted to impress me . To show how little time there was left . " " Will you print the date ? " " No . Will you tell me about the drug business ? " " No . There are more important things for you to know . " " Such as ? " " Go to New Orleans . You 'll meet one of the Five Perfect Masters there . " " How ? " " He 'll find you . Do n't worry . Take things as they come . " That was the end of that . The Katmandu interlude was over . I came down from the mountains . I fell out of love with Lakshmi , with Geraldine . I stopped crying in the night . I threw out my Valium . I had beenp83in a state , all right . But by the time that the 747 landed at Los Angeles , I was myself again . Kalki was not god . I was certain of that . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business . I had yet to find the connection between a drug syndicate and a new religion . Obviously there was one . I did not believe that Kalki would switch off the human race on April 3 , as desirable a happening as that might be . What did I really think at the beginning of last March , without hindsight ? I thought that Kalki was out of his skull . But I also thought that he might really think that he could do what he said he was going to do . One curious thing : No matter how rigorously I bathed , I continued to smell his blondness on my body . This lasted for a week . Stigmata ? I hoped that Arlene would not notice.  |p84ARLENE  AND I MADE LOVE FOR TWO HOURS THE DAY THAT I GOTback from Asia . Though groggy with jet lag , I was my true self again . I was out of the mountains . I have never understood why Arlene and I were a duo , as the gossip columnists used to say . Arlene had no interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read a book . I did , and do . She was old . enough to be my mother . Well , answers to questions come at the end of sentences . My Christ Scientist mother was a monster . A line from the logbook , by Jules Renard : " There is nothing harder to look at than the face of a mother you do not love and for whom you are sorry . " Except that I was never sorry for her , only for myself , the only child . I escaped into books , flying , engineering , French literature . I did not go . . . I fled to school . Anything to get away from home . One bright afternoon in my twenty-fifth year , Mrs. Hecht thoroughly cleaned the two-bedroom condominium in Santa Ana that she had bought after the death of my father . She then prepared herself a cup of tea and settled down in an easy chair just opposite the tcicvi/sion set , which was broken . The repairman was due any minute . During the any minute , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bag over her head and suffocated . The television repairman found Mrs. Hecht early that evening ( he had been delayed ) . Headline of the newspaper on her lap : TEDDYOTTINGER WINS INTERNATIONAL HARMON TROPHY . I had killed her . Mysuccess had killed her . She was a jealous woman , no doubt of that . Once , at bridge , she had tried to strangle her partner . She did not have many friends . Shortly after my mother 's death ( which she did not believe in but I did ) , I started to take up with older women . Earl Jr . never suspected . But then neither did I. For a long time I did not realize why I so much enjoyed the company of Hilda Barefield , of Renee Dubilier . It was Hilda who seduced me , finally . I never looked back . After Beyond Motherhood , Arlene and I lived together openly . Surrogate mother ? Why not ? She also paid the bills . " I hope you told Mike Wallace that I think he 's a pussycat . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whenever Jedda Coffee was given her after a bad experience with the Other Brand . I never allowed her cuteness to cause me a moment 's distress . " I did n't get to speak to him . Has the show gone on yet ? " " I do n't watch , angel . You know that . " I have still not been able to sort out satisfactorily the events of last March . My main recollection is one of panic . I was also suffering from a recurrent nightmare that I had never had before , or since . I am backstage , in a theater . I am the star of a play . The curtain has gone up . I am waiting in the wings for my cue . Suddenly I realize that I do n't know what the play is about . I have not learned the lines . I try to slip out the stage door . A stage manager brings me back . He shoves me out onto the stage . Lights blind me . Applause deafens me . Then an actor finishes a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cue . I try to speak ; but no sound comes . Silence . I can just make out the audience on the other side of the lights . They watch me , expectantly . As the silence continues , they are the ones who break it . They whisper to one another . They are angry . Then I wake up , in a sweat . Yet I have never acted in a play . In some mysterious way , Arlene and her actor friends must have transferred to me their own anxieties . So many other things arep86contagious , so why not nightmares ? For me , the events of March were like pieces to a puzzle that I could not fit together . Or a play whose dialogue I had not learned . I did not see Earl Jr . or the children . But I spoke several times to my former worse half on the telephone . Sample conversation : " So you 're back , Teddy . " Earl Jr . was accusing . Emphasis on the word " back . " " How are the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Earl Jr . escalated more rapidly than usual . But then I was behind with the alimony payments . " Of course I care . " " You have n't asked about Lenore and the operation . " " How is she ? " " After they removed the right breast , they had to go back in and remove all the lymph nodes from under her right arm . Three of those nodes showed signs of malignancy . Lenore 's staying with me now in your old room and is undergoing chemotherapy at the hospital . Her hair has all fallen out , Teddy . Lenore 's beautiful thick hair . " If ever Mother Nature designed a classic fag-hag plus fag-son team , it was Lenore and Earl Jr . But Mother Nature is famous for her humor . Despite appearances , Earl Jr . was doggedly heterosexual while Lenore had no time for fags . I married too young . That is the usual cop-out , and is usually true . Earl Jr . and I had , at the most , four good weeks together . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hilda convinced me that we are what we are and whatever I was , wife and mother was not a part of the initial psychic blueprint . These things are no one 's fault . My father always said that I should have been a boy . I will not dwell on the implications of that opinion . He was an intelligent man . He made fiberglass boats until he was conned into selling his patents to a large corporation . He died poor . Although I was fond of him and he was proud of me , I could never forgive him for not marrying Amelia Earhart . I am sure that he could have . He had been interested in aviation at the time . He was also a do-gooder . He joined her for a time at Denison House in Boston . They worked with the poor . But he was too self-effacing , and she was too restless . Finally , she took to the sky for the fun of it . The Fun of It was the title of her best hook . 1 le told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white . Dark like me , he was turned on by blondness . I told Earl Jr . that I was sorry about Lenore 's hair but glad that the operation had been a success . I promised him that I would pay him his alimony as soon as I got around to depositing my first check from Kalki Enterprises . Then I talked to the children . They sounded fine . I said that I would see them at Easter , as soon as I got back from New York . Obviously I did not take seriously Kalki 's prediction . In fact , I had insisted on a three-month contract , from the first of March to the first of June . Kalki had agreed . But he had also added , with a catlike grin , " I do n't think you 'll hold me to it . " On my second day back in L.A. , Bruce Sapersteen came to see me . He had flown " out to the Coast just to meet you , Teddy ! " I received him in Arlene 's library , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set of TV Guide from the first issue to date . Reputedly , Arlene was in every issue , something for The Guinness Book of World Records . Bruce Sapersteen was tall , dark , willowy . In every way the reverse of my mental image of him . The telephone is the great deceiver . Sadly , I dyed black the carroty curls that I had given him ; removed the bushy sideburns ; smeared evenly the pink freckled skin with Acapulco Sunbrownpancake . He was almost a decade younger than I. Columbia School of Journalism . Village Voice . The National Sun . The pieces that he had written in my name sounded like Tom Wolfe on a very had day . I suppose that this was a slight improvement on H.V. Weiss 's tightly coiled Hemingway-type prose ; but not much . When it came to " as told to " collaborators , my cup had a tendency to overflow . " You 're a lot better-looking than your pictures , Teddy . " This is always an acceptable opening . If I did not warm to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Bruce . I read your pieces . I thought you 'd be younger . " " Thanks , Teddy . " Like most journalists , Bruce seldom listened . " We 've got a great thing going , you and me . Morgan 's happy ; circulation'sgone up . Everyone 's following our lead . We ought to be able to squeeze a lot more out until he blows it . " " Blows it ? " " Kalki says he 's going to give a definite date for the end of the worldp88at Madison Square Garden . When that day comes , Kalki 's out of business . Want a snort ? " Bruce produced a cocaine snifter . I shook my head . He sniffed . Then , nose pink and runny , he brought me up to date . " We 've nailed down the drug connection . The lawyers are going over it right now . Soon as they give the green light , we 're off and running . " " What kind of proof have you got ? " Bruce opened a notebook . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thailand . In Bangkok he became associated with the Chao Chow Overseas Chinese Community , one of the principal drug syndicates in the world . The Golden Triangle is their turf . Kelly 's worked with them ever since , peddling not only white heroin , but heroin-3 , our old friend brown sugar . Kelly has a partner in New Orleans , one Giles Lowell , M.D. Take notes . " I took notes . " Together they own something called the New Orleans Tropical Bird and Fish Company . Along with legal consignments of birds and fish from Latin America , they receive consignmentsof drugs , which are then dispersed all over the country . Morgan wants you to go to New Orleans . Describe the shop . Interview Dr. Lowell . Then just sit back and leave the writing to us . " Bruce closed the notebook , very pleased with himself . A single drop of clear liquid clung to the tip of his nose . " Anything to oblige , " I said . " But what is the connection between Kalki the god and Kelly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " So that 's for me to find out . " " That , and the date of the end of the world . When we know those two things , it 's fat thirty time . " Bruce had obviously been impressed by journalism school . But then so was I. By schools . If the line at the registration office at USC had been shorter last year , and if I had been looking better and not got a nosebleed , I would have enrolled in graduate school like half the intelligent women that I knew ( and quite a few that were not so bright ) . Yes , I would have gone back to school . I would have started all over again , and got my doctorate , and had a second life , if that first go-round could properly be called a life at all . Beyond motherhood  --  a Ph.D. ? Anyway , the line at the office had been too long . I had split . Now I am in the White House . Yes , this is a success story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I knew the magical date . I also slid notp89mention that I was under contract to Kalki Enterprises . I felt no disloyalty . Without me , there would have been no story of any kind . I was just a front , and knew it . And did not care . Morgan and I were using each other . But I did wonder at the coincidence . Kalki had wanted me to go to New Orleans , to meet a Perfect Master . Now the Sun also wanted me to go to New Orleans . Had there been collusion ? If I was not in a paranoid state , I was on the border . The drop fell from Bruce 's pink nose . He seemed not to notice . Last year a lot of people that you met were sniffing coke . I did n't dare . If my reflexes are not swift , I am out of business . Dead . " We 've made a reservation for you at the Lafitte Hotel . In the French Quarter . " Bruce gave me an envelope . " Ticket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be walking into the middle of a tong war down there . " This was too much . I crossed the state line into paranoia . " I did n't know there were any Chinese in Louisiana . " " That 's not what I meant . Last year when Kelly went public with all this messiah shit , he broke with the Chao Chow syndicate . That 's why he is going to get hit . " As Bruce spoke , I saw again the bomb at the back of the Garuda . I wanted to go to the bathroom . " The Chao Chow have taken out a contract on him . It 's with this underground Chinese society called Triad . Triad 's got people all over the world . Hit men . You pay . They kill . Could n't be neater . The latest word out of Hong Kong is that Kelly is going to get himself hit some time in April . April , " said Bruce with a coke-inspired giggle , " is the cruelest month . Get it ? " I got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THE AGEof Kali . The air was dark with smoke from oil refineries . There were too many cars , people , crime , violence , anomie . As a result , Kalki wasGORE VIDALcatching on . Also , while I had been in Asia , the so-called Lotus Lotterieshad become a national pastime . Lottery , of course , was a misnomer . In a lottery you buy a ticket and if your ticket bears a lucky number you win a bundle . The white paper lotuses were not bought but given away . Then , each week , the press announced the winning numbers , and cash prizes were doled out by Kalki Enterprises . Kalki was now a household word . Although no one understood where the money was coming from , everyone enjoyed the Lotus Lotteries . The contemporary New Orleans note was struck by the taxi driver who took me in from the airport . He was white , middle-aged ; he was from New York and believed . . . . But let him speak for himself : " I never pick up the coloreds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Although it struck the back of his neck , he was impervious . " You think , " said the driver , " that maybe I 'm prejudiced or a bigot . Well , I was n't until last year when I picked up these two black guys and one pulled this gun on me and said , you drive out to the edge of town to where this unfinished high-rise was . Well , I kept on telling them how I had only a few dollars which they could have but , no , they were n't interested . We gon na kill you , ' one of them kept saying . So when we got to this deserted building site , they told me to get out of the car and the one with the gun kept saying , We gon na kill you ! ' " " What happened ? " I was interested in spite of myself . " I got shot twice in the stomach and then they ran away . Well , I was lucky because I was able to crawl over to the car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Mounted in a small gold picture frame were two short newspaper items . " Cab driver shot " was indeed the story . I was impressed . Just as we turned into Canal Street , I saw the first of the Kalki billboards . There was Kalki 's face , thirty times as large as life . In color . Beneath the face , " The End . " And that was all . Twenty thousand similar billboards had been set up all around the United States as a sort of teaser for Kalki 's appearance on CBS 's 6o Minutes , which in itself was a trailer for the rally in Madison Square Garden . Since talking to taxicab drivers was the hallmark of the higher journalism , I asked the driver what he thought of Kalki . " I do n't , " he said firmly , " pick up the coloreds any more . " He repeated the story of the shooting without so much as altering a word . From that epoch I remember only two thingsp91vividly . The cabdriver with the thick neck . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blue sneakers and a hankering for draft beer . Memory is a mystery . The Lafitte Hotel was a brand-new hotel that did its best to imitate the gracious hotels of yesteryear . I imitated the gracious aviatrix of this year . I asked for messages . There were none . I tried to ring Morgan Davies . He was in conference . I rang Dr. Giles Lowell . He was out of town . Not a good beginning . The legendary French Quarter was definitely ominous . At all hours of day and night , people were drunk , stoned . But some of the houses were charming , and the fancy ironwork balconies lived up to expectation . Not all the magnolia trees were sick . One or two had produced a waxy yellow flower , shyly unfolding in the acrid air . At the end of Dauphine Street was a large two-story wooden house with an iron gallery at the second floor . A discreet sign announced : NEWORLEANS TROPICAL BIRD AND FISH COMPANY . Through street-level windows , I could see hundreds of caged birds . Parrots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of tropical birds ' names though as a girl I had been a devoted bird-watcher . But nothing as exotic as those scarlet , green , yellow , blue creatures had ever come my way in Southern California . The birds stared through the windows at me ; eyes as bright and as fixed as those of their saurian cousins . Beaks opened and shut but no sound came through ( bulletproof ? ) glass . I put on an amiable , stupid smile , and went inside . I knew my part : Suburban housewife wants to assemble an aquarium for her young son in order to teach him nature 's way of balancing an eco-system , or once the big fish have eaten up all of the little fish , they fight with one another . Backwards Mother Nature spells " Dinner . " The main showroom occupied the whole downstairs of the house . There were a number of what looked to be customers . But I took nothing at face value . I assumed that the narcs were the ones who seemed most interested in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while the pushers were those who came and went , looking businesslike . I studied each face covertly , fearful of finding a Chinese face attached to the sinuous body of a tong killer . But there were no exotic faces in the shop . On the other hand , the shop itself was not only exotic , it was a trip ,  |p92as  the addicts say . Lights inside the fish tanks cast swirling water reflections upon the walls while the discordant screams of the birds managed , quickly , to give me a blinding menstrual-style headache . I sat on a chair next to a door marked PRIVATE , and shut my eyes . I tried to screen out the psychedelic effect , only to find that the rainbow colors went right on blazing and writhing behind my shut lids . " Can I help you , miss ? " A woman 's voice . I opened my eyes . A small what H.V.W. would call mousy woman was looking down at me  --  suspiciously ? Nervously ? Nothingly ? I was now in the highlands of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed to her. , I could have been a legitimate customer taken ill , or an illegitimate customer suffering from too much brown sugar in my tea . I prayed that my stupid smile was on straight . " I have a headache . That 's all . The birds are so loud . " " I know . I really hate them . " She had a thick Southern accent . She was nervous . " And I have to work here . " " That must be awful for you . " " I like the job . It 's just those awful birds . But can I help you , miss ? " " Well , I do n't know . I wanted to start an aquarium . For my son . He 's ten . That 's a wonderful age . When you 're still so open and yet so ... " But you 're not from New Orleans . " She had spotted my accent . " Surely , you do n't have to be from New Orleans to have a tropical fish tank . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She gave me a pin-sharp look . Had I said a code phrase ? " No , I guess you do n't . " " Actually , my husband and I have only just moved here from near Sacramento where we used to live . Marysville , the town is called ... " At that moment the door marked PRIVATE opened and out stepped Jason McCloud . He looked very natty in a conservative gray flannel suit . He carried an attache case . I tried to become invisible by widening my cretin 's smile . Our eyes for a moment locked in the best Weissean tradition . Then the lock was swiftly broken . Showing more white to his eyes than was absolutely necessary , McCloud fled , nearly upsetting a birdcage . The cage 's occupant screamed irritably . " Do you know each other ? " asked the girl . " No , I do n't think so . " I almost said that they all I(x)k alike to me ,  |p93the  sort of thing Arlene 's friends liked to say seriously to one another as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ America 's last white hope . " Is that Dr. Lowell 's office ? " I pointed to the door marked PRIVATE . " Yes , it is . " The girl frowned . " But he 's not here . Do you have an appointment ? " Just as I was about to play Teddy Ottinger , Investigative Journalist , able to plumb the deepest throat in order to get that scoop or beat or whatever they call it , someone at the front of the store called out , " Mrs. Kelly ! " The girl excused herself . I was in luck . The girl proved to be Estelle Kelly , first wife of James J. There had been no mention of her in any of the stories about Kalki ; she was a non-person , as they used to say in the people 's paradises of the East . But non-person or not , there she was . I took her to lunch . I did my best to charm her . Shy , bad-tempered , nervous , Estelle Kelly was not easily charmed . At first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ careful to spread as much truth around as possible . I told her that I was Kalki 's pilot , that I wanted to meet Dr. Lowell , that I was writing some pieces for The National Sun , but only to help Kalki . Estelle regarded me with deep suspicion . Even so , she allowed me to take her to her favorite restaurant where I would be able to sample New Orleans ' fabled Creole cuisine , which you can have . " Jim 's a bastard . " This was Estelle 's thoughtful analysis of her first husband . We had each polished off a pair of Sazerac cocktails , a local killer . The restaurant was crowded , expensive and bad . I picked at an elaborate dish that had been made with frozen shrimp that tasted of iodine . As of last spring , you put your life at risk if you ate a fish , assuming that you could pay for one . The waiter brought us a second bottle of California wine . I was eager to get Estelle drunk , to get her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the table any day of any week . Up to a point , she was forthcoming . My-husband-is-a-bastard was good stuff . But not for me . I was out to serve Kalki as well as the Sun . Double agentry had its charms , and dangers . I presented her with mild little questions on the order of : " But you 're still on good terms ? " " Why should I he ? " Estelle frowned . " One minute I 'm the wife . Right ? The next minute I'in the ex-wife . No explanation . Things end.  |p94That  's what he said . Then he took up with that Pannicker girl . I do n't think they 're legally married . Not that that would bother Jimmy , even though we 're both Catholics . At least , I am and he used to be . " " Now , " I said , with a confiding smile , and just a trace of skepticism in my voice , " he 's god . " " Can you believe it ? " A hectic pink muddied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had enlarged pores . " I was bowled over when I heard the news . First he gets rid of me . Right ? Then I pick up a newspaper and read how he 's gone and started a new religion . He 's crazy . I tried to explain to her that the Hindu religion was not exactly new . By the time I had got to the part about Kalki being the avatar , I had lost her attention . " I suppose , " she said , " there 's money in it . I mean , you see all those kids in the street with the pamphlets and the paper flowers . Well , they must collect something from somebody . Right ? And now those billboards ! I could n't believe it when I drove to work this morning and saw that big sign , showing Jimmy up there , announcing The End . Can you believe it ? " I said that , no , personally I could not accept Kalki 's message . But I did feel that he was serious about his religion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ending . " You 're the one , " said Estelle suddenly , " who pays alimony to your ex-husband . " " I feel women ought to . Some women , " I added , quickly . " Certainly not in your case . Kalki left you . So he owes you a lot . But I left my husband . I was also making more money than he was . And so when he got custody of the children . . . " I stopped the autobiography . " Does Kalki pay you alimony ? " Estelle nodded . I could see that I was not a heroine in her eyes . I had let down the team : " Take ' em to the cleaners " was the perennial cry of the pussycat . But I was not in New Orleans to spread the gospel of equal rights . " Kalki owns that bird and fish shop , does n't he ? " For once H.V.W. would have been correct if he had said that a pair of eyes narrowed . Estelle 's eyes became " mere " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , carefully . " Of course , they 're old friends . Jimmy studied with Dr. Lowell at Tulane . Jimmy was premed . I ) r Lowell was hisp95teacher . Now , I should warn you that I 'm not going to say anything about jimmy , one way or the other , except that I think he was a bastard the way he just let me go on for years thinking that we would be living together when he got back from Asia , only he never came back . " " When did you see him the last time ? " " During his last year in the army . We met in Bangkok . R and R. That was 1968 . He said as soon as he got discharged , he 'd come straight home to New Orleans . This is the best rum cake in town . " The rum cake was good . And Estelle 's mood began to improve . " He also said he wanted to go on to medical school . But I knew even then that that was all talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he could speak all the languages . I suppose he must have had a lot of girl friends there . Natives . Madame Butterfly stuff . I always thought he was oversexed . Anyway , when he got out of the army , he stayed in Saigon . I said I was ready to join him , though I hate Chinese food . Next thing , he asked for a divorce . Just like that . I will say he was generous . He paid for me to go to Mexico . Not long after I got back , he calls me up from Bangkok . He says he 's married to this rich girl named Doris Pannicker . He wants me to be happy . He hopes I 'll marry again . God , men are rotten ! Anyway , I hung up the phone . And took a job . " " At the shop ? " Estelle nodded . There were tears in her eyes . I knew how she felt . " Giles . . . Dr. Lowell , I mean , quit Tulane that year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , jimmy had been sort of a pet of his . Giles was tired of teaching . Tired of being poor . He loved tropical birds . The fish came later . They were sort of an afterthought , like the shrunken heads . Anyway , he opened the shop , and I went to work for him . He 's made a great success . And I like to work . " There was not much conviction in that last statement . We finished the wine in silence . At the next table crepes were burning out of control . A panicky waiter poured brandy on the fire . There was a whoosh of blue flame . Everyone was delighted , and drunk . A tropical town . " Where does the money come from ? " " Money ? " Estelle watched intently as the waiter made us cafe bulk . " The shop does real well , if that 's what you mean . " " I meant for Kalki . " " God knows . But he can charm the little birds right down from the t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dropped the subject , and I couldp96not get her to take it up again . " You know , " she said , suddenly cozy , " between us , I hate birds . I have a thing about them . So I went to a psychiatrist , a friend of Giles . . . of Dr. Lowell . And he told me this story about this woman who went to Dr. Jung , the psychiatrist in Switzerland , and told him how every time she went outside the birds would attack her . So Dr. Jung said , ' Madam , I 'm sure that you just think they do . Let 's take a walk in my garden and you 'll see that this is all in your imagination . ' Right ? So they walked in Dr. Jung 's garden and all the birds attacked her . Well , I 'm like that . I mean , they do n't attack me but they give me the shivers . " I was feeling a bit drunk by then . The cafe brule was getting to me . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " I feel safer when they 're in their cages . " The first Mrs. Kelly was definitely one for the books . But I needed her . I did my best to draw her out . But it was useless . She appeared to have no real interest in Kalki . They had not met in years . On the other hand , she was obsessed by Lakshmi . She saw her as cashing in . Money meant a lot to Estelle . Also , religion . " You 've got to remember , " she said , " that Jimmy was never religious . He never went to Mass . His mother was really upset , because they 're very religious , the Irish out by the Irish Channel . My people were Creole . Which does not mean part Negro . We 're the original settlers , from France , intermarried with Spanish . The Irish came much later . I-was at Saint Ursula 's convent , you know . Only certain families are allowed to send their daughters there . We were always warned against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't listen . " " Where did you first meet . . . Jimmy ? " I was roving reporter ; keen , to the point . " Dance class . We both studied with Eglanova . Here in New Orleans . She 's dead now . But her studio 's still going strong out on NapoleonStreet . She was a prima ballerina with the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo . " " Dance ? " My mind did an H.V.W. reel . " Ballet dancing ? " " Oh , yes . Fact , Eglanova always said that Jimmy had the makings of a really great dancer even though he did n't start till he was seventeen , which is late . " " I find it hard to believe . I do n't know why . " " I do n't know why either . I Ic was very serious about it , tcxl . You see ,  |p97he  had had polio . A light case . But he wanted to build up his legs . That 's when he started taking dance class . We both kept going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's uncommonly muscular legs were now explained . Most of the pieces of the jigsaw were now at hand . Ballet . Premed . Roman Catholic marriage to Estelle . Vietnam . Medical corps . Drugs ? Civil divorce . Remarriage ? Religion . The links of the chain were clattering , but not yet into place . " There 's nothing sissy about ballet nowadays . Jimmy was n't at all gay , you know . " I know , I thought to myself . But then I did not really know . Whoever does ? Bisexuality is a strange business . According to the best authorities , there is no such thing as bisexuality except among bisexuals . " He had wonderful elevation . I had a lovely long line . But not much stamina . Jimmy 's a strange boy . " Dreamily , Estelle slurred already slurred Southern vowels . " Always was , I guess . Not that I had any way of knowing when I was a kid . We were so young . Right ? We just drifted along . At Tulane I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then he shifted over to chemistry . I thought he 'd make a really fine scientist . He had that kind of technical mind . I could see him in a white smock , cooking up things for Du Pont . " Estelle sighed , " Wilmington is such a lovely city . I always hoped we 'd live there . I really did . I have relatives outside Wilmington , the Jarvises . But then came Vietnam . . . " Estelle looked in need of the proverbial good cry . I needed oxygen . The fumes from the burned crepes were stifling . " I know what it 's like , " I said . I played sympathetic girl friend . " When I married Earl Jr . I thought we 'd be living in Seattle . He was going to be an engineer with Boeing . I loved Seattle . " None of this was true but I wanted to make her feel at ease with me . Sisters in suffering . " But then he went into real estate , in Santa Monica . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " it never is . " She was beginning to show signs if not of drunkenness , of high-ness . I had let her drink the entire second bottle of wine . " When , " I struck , softly , " did Jimmy get into drugs ? " Estelle sobered up . She took the cigarette that she had just lit and stubbed it out in the remains of the rum cake . She got her handbag off the floor and onto the table . " I do n't know anything about drugs , Mrs. Ottinger . I must he going now . Such a nice lunch ... "  |p98I  paid the bill . I maintained an exemplary coolness . " Funny , I thought you did . I mean you know Jason McCloud , and he 's with the DEA . You know , the black man with the attache case . " " I never saw him before . " Estelle stood up . " I have to go . " I walked her back to the shop . At the corner of Canal Street we were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wore yellow robes and sandals . They carried books , magazines , white paper lotuses . " Kalki has come , " one of them said , nicely . " The end of the world is here . Would you like to be prepared ? To purify yourself ? " Each of us was given a booklet . And a white paper lotus . " I average about two of these damned things a day . " Estelle threw the pamphlet into an open cellar . But kept the lotus . She was obviously playing the lottery . " I 've never read such nonsense . Ever ! How a good Catholic boy like Jimmy could end up spouting all this Hindu nonsense is beyond me . " " You do n't think he 's really god ? " " Are you crazy ? Of course not . " Estelle 's face set , if that 's what faces do when the line of the jaw is abruptly squared through a deliberate occlusion of back molars . " On the other hand , I do n't think he 's crazy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know what . " " Money ? " " No . " Estelle did not expand since any expansion would involve a further discussion of the bird and fish shop . " He 's a very radical person . And if he thinks he 's right , and if he 's figured out all the angles , why , he 's capable of anything . You know he 's a genius . " " At what ? " " IQ . Scientific capacity . Giles . . . Dr. Lowell says he 's unique . " " Do they still see each other ? " Estelle looked me straight in the eye , the way liars are always advised to do . " Never . How could they ? Jimmy has n't been home in years . And Giles never leaves town . " " I thought you told me earlier that he was out of town . " " Out of the office . He 'll be back later . I 'll tell him you 're at the Lafitte Hotel . " In Dauphine Street a second group of Kalki-ites @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to their ashram . A guru would tell us about the various ages of man that had led up to the age of Kali , our age , the last age . We would also he shown how to meditate , how to he and notp99be , how to purify ourselves in order to move on to a higher sphere . As we slipped away from the kids , they waved goodbye to us . They were sweet . " I do n't understand why people are so attracted to Kalki . " And I was n't , not entirely anyway . " All he promises them is The End . And that 's not exactly a happy message . " " Well , maybe they 're as sick of this as I am ! " Estelle was unexpectedlyharsh . " But is n't there always hope ... " My Pollyaniad was cut short . " Shit , " said Estelle . We were in front of the store . " Thanks for lunch . Give Jimmy my regards . I 'll tell Dr. Lowell you want to see him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the hotel , I was more than pleased with myself . Journalists seldom did much more than rewrite what was already known to be news . But I had actually come up with something new ; in fact , news . By going to New Orleans , I had been able to meet the unknown first wife and , presently , with luck , I would meet Kalki 's old teacher , Giles Lowell . Why had no one else done what I had done ? I tried to find reasons , keeping at bay dark suspicions . For one thing , Kalki had been news for less than a year . . . a year in which he had been obliged to compete for media space with the energy crisis , the drought , recession , unemployment , Reverend Sun Moon , and the blunders of the administration in Washington . Only in the last two weeks had the momentum increased . Between those ( thousands ? ) of young Kalki-ites in the streets and all those billboards , Kalki was now world-famous . Yet of all the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ met the two wives , to have .... I was suddenly engulfed by a wave of paranoia . Kalki had deliberately made it easy for me . He had told Estelle to talk to me . He had wanted me to write her version of his life . I was being set up . First , by Estelle ( hut was she really who she said she was ? ) and then by a mysterious Perfect Master . I was being tested . Why ? and for what ?  |p100WHEN  I SAW JASON MCCLOUD SEATED IN THE LOBBY OF THE hotel , I thought for one terrible moment that he was a Perfect Master , posing as a narc . But he proved to be just a narc , and a very jittery one at that . McCloud got to his feet . I said , " Hello . " The clerk at the desk gave me a telephone message . I was to ring Bruce Sapersteen in New York . At home . " I got to see you . " McCloud no longer carried an attache case . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hotel . Then I rang Bruce . " Hi , Teddy ! " Bruce sounded stoned . I could imagine the glowing pinkness of his nose . " I 've been to the bird and fish shop . I 'm still trying to interview Dr. Lowell . I 've met Kalki 's first wife . " " Great ! When you hear the blip , start dictating . " I heard the blip , and told my story . When I had finished , Bruce came on the line again . " That 's good stuff . I do n't know how we missed out on the first wife . Lousy research , I guess . Anyway , we 're getting a lot of feedback on the stories . The drug connection gets plainer every day . " " But how can you use it ? " " Morgan 's trying to work it out with the lawyers . Kalki Enterprises has got a lot of money behind them . But we 're getting help from the government , on the sly . Even so , it 's tricky ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's pilot ? " When in doubt , tell the truth . I had written Morgan a letter , to make it official . So far , there had been no answer . " No . He thinks it 's a great idea . We 're advertising the next piece as inside stuff from Kalki 's personal beautiful pilot , with a picture of you , looking gorgeous , with those big boobs ... " " Go to hell , Bruce . I 'm a divorced woman . "  |p101Sa|persteen  giggled uncontrollably . I hung up . McCloud was seated in a corner of the bar , a dark place with a black bartender got up to resemble an ante-bellum old retainer . I decided to risk yet another Sazerac . McCloud was drinking bourbon in great quantities . He spoke in a whisper even though we were the only people in the bar . " Ms. Ottinger , I feel that you owe the Drug Enforcement Administrationan explanation . " That was a startling icebreaker . " For what ? " " Why were you in the New Orleans Tropical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start an aquarium . " " This is not a joke , Ms. Ottinger . " " Let me be the judge of that , Mr. McCloud . " I took the offensive . " What were you doing there ? " " My job . " " Which is ? " " The detection of drug pushers . " " What was in that attache case you were carrying ? Drugs or payoff money ? " McCloud gave me a look not entirely empty of Weissean bale . " You could be arrested . Right now . By me . " " What charge ? " " Possession of cocaine . In your handbag . Three ounces . " I held the handbag to my chest . " There is no cocaine in this handbag . " If I say there is cocaine , " said McCloud in a slow breathy voice , " then there is . And you go to jail . My word against yours . " I was moderately alarmed . Setting up the innocent was a favorite practice of America 's numerous secret as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finest used always to carry marijuana roaches in their pockets . If they disliked someone , the roach would then be planted in the victim 's car or home . The policeman would then say , " Aha ! We caught you ! " And the innocent would be busted . And he would stay busted because no judge ever publicly doubted a policeman 's word . After all , judges can he set up , too . They had a lot of fun , the police in L.A. ; elsewhere , too.  |p102I  stayed on the offensive . " I know a lot about you . " I invented freely . " You are being paid off by Kalki Enterprises . You were with Dr. Lowell today . He gave you money . I ca n't prove it  --  yet . But the Sun has a half-dozen researchers checking out this story , and you 're part of the story . So my advice is lay off . And get a good lawyer . " I thought this scene well-played . I reminded myself of Claire Trevor in a Bogart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and saw himself as the black Bogart . " You 're getting in over your head , Ms. Ottinger . " He still spoke in a heavy whisper . But now he twitched his upper lip . Bogart . " You 're right about the bird and fish shop . I 've infiltrated it . And I 'm in with Dr. Lowell . And I want to stay in with him . I do n't want you making a mess . I 'm a professional . You 're an amateur . We 're getting close to an arrest . I do n't want you interfering . " " What constitutes interfering , Mr. McCloud ? " " Interviewing Dr. Lowell . Writing about the bird and fish shop in the Sun . " " I would have thought anything that we might write would be helpful to you . " " We have a timetable , Ms. Ottinger . Premature revelation could undo all our work . I 'm with White . " I heard this as " I 'm white . " With blacks the problem of color always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I 'm on special assignment for the White committee . " I looked at him , I suppose , blankly . I got an irritable explanation . " Senator JohnsonWhite is chairman of the Senate Narcotics Abuse and Control Committee . They 're currently investigating the world drug scene . I 've been assigned to Kalki Enterprises . That 's why I was in Katmandu . That 's why I 'm here . In a few weeks there will be a public hearing . Kalki will be called . Senator White does n't want anybody to break the news before he does . " I assumed McCloud was lying . Whether or not he was working for the White committee was beside the point which was that McCloud was working for McCloud . I was positive that he was on the take from Kalki Enterprises . But I played dumb . And , I think , beautiful . " I did n't realize ! " I gave him an awed little woman gaze . " You 're really important , are n't you ? " McCloud fell , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my purposes . I wanted to neutralize him . " Yes , 1 aln , " he whispered . Ip103think a " thickly " would be apt . He was getting drunk . " Do you think you could get me an introduction to Senator White ? Off the record ? Background briefing , **39;5496;TOOLONG of thing ? " " I might , " McCloud was now staring at my blouse . Miscegenation was in the air ; it hovered like a mushroom cloud between us . I was saved by the bell , literally . A telephone call . I rose . McCloud remained seated . I took his huge black hand in my fairly tiny white ones . " That 's my date , " I whispered . " You 've been an angel . " I pursed my lips for an instant ; then fled . McCloud did not move . He was smiling . " This is Dr. Giles Lowell . " The voice on the telephone was pleasant , only slightly Southern in accent . " Estelle Kelly said you would like to meet me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Kalki , you know . " " Yes , I know . I 'm at the shop now . Why do n't you come around ? Ring the front doorbell three times . I 'll let you in . " I said that I would be right over . Just to be on the safe side , I rang Bruce in New York . He screamed , " Hello . " It was one of those nights . In the background I could hear the hi-fi blaring Joni Mitchell in her latest phase . " Listen , Bruce . I 'm off to see Dr. Lowell . At the shop . " " Good hunting . Tally ho ... " " Shut up . I 'm telling you this in case I 'm murdered . " " Oh , " Bruce sniffed . " You think he 's dangerous ? " " The whole thing is dangerous . Life is dangerous . Anyway , I 'm off . Also , check out one Jason McCloud , allegedly a narc . He 's black . He acts as if he 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in trouble . He says he 's working for Senator White 's committee ... " " White 's going after Kalki ? " " So he says . " " White 's running for president . " " I 'm running late . " I hung up . I was nervous . There are times when it is a definite drag being a woman . I have never feared rape . Or flying . Or people in general . But I am constantly haunted by the thought of a tall , heavy , male figure . He comes up behind me on a dark street . He does n't want my treasure . He wants my life . I feel his arm about my neck . I ca n't sec his face . I ca n't breathe . I 'm helpless . Bourbon Street was at least well-lit , and I walked its length , avoidingp104the side streets as long as possible , particularly Dauphine Street where the overhanging galleries made an absolute darkness in which lurked , I was certain , innumerable large , heavy , masculine figures , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the back . Bourbon Street was not exactly fun for an unescorted woman in an aquamarine dress copied from Halston . Sex was in the air . Also , thuddingmusic from the bars . Everyone looked lurid in the glare of neon lights . At night a single woman was a challenge in that city , on that street . Men stared at me . Some leered . None , thank God , flashed . I concentrated on my handbag , and filled it with an imaginary revolver which I proceeded to load . Through sheer concentration , I was able to convince even the drunkest John that I was armed , and dangerous . As it turned out , the women were worse than the men . Sex was on their minds  --  but not with me . I was competition . I was elbowed ; kicked . The hookers did not fear the imaginary revolver . I walked quickly . Avoided as much as possible contact of any kind with anyone . A sailor vomited . A white pulled a knife on a black in a doorway . Everyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drifted by , eyes half-shut , cheeks seeming to rest on air as on a pillow . The Kalki kids did not , wisely , come out at night . The last two blocks on Dauphine Street were terrifying . Beneath those forbidding galleries , the coffee-scented darkness contained every sort of danger . I walked , trotted , ran the last few yards to the bird and fish shop . It was closed . Through unshuttered windows , lighted fish tanks glowed like fluid opals . I rang the bell three times . The door opened . Dr. Giles Lowell was tall , thin , bald . He was not , I remember thinking , gratefully , large or heavy or behind me . When I started to speak , he put a finger to his lips . Then he motioned for me to follow him . On tiptoe we walked between the rows of shimmering fish tanks and shrouded birdcages . Some kind of floral spray had been used to neutralize the harsh odor of the birds . The resulting smell gave me my second headache for the day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to let me pass , in darkness , up the stairs . My heart was pounding . Now he was behind me . But I got to his office without rape , murder , assault . He switched on a light . " Come in , Mrs. Ottinger , " He was gracious . " Forgive the stealth and the darkness . But if you so much as switch on a light or say two words in the shop , every one of those damned birds wakes up andp105it 's an hour before you can get them to go to sleep again . Do sit down . I 'm Dr. Lowell , of course . " " Of course , " I said , not too brightly , taking inventory of the room . There was nothing worth noting . A big desk , a sofa , two chairs , a filing cabinet , a series of watercolors of exotic birds . " Dr. Lowell , " I picked up on the title . " Do you still practice medicine ? " " Oh , no . But then I never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I became a businessman . ' " The overhead fluorescent light made the dome of his bald head glimmer blue . " Jim Kelly was a good student , if I may plunge right in . I know you are writing about him . I 've read your two pieces in the Sun . " " I do n't really write them . " I was properly defensive . It had never been my dream to be a nom de plume first for H.V. Weiss and now for B. Sapersteen . Amelia wrote her own books ; and poetry , too . " I quite understand . I have talked to Jimmy  --  or Kalki  --  about you . He told me you are to be his personal pilot . " " Yes . But he also wanted me to keep on with the Sun . To find out what they . . . know . " I was never very good at deceit . " What they know , " Dr. Lowell repeated . He looked uncommonly sinister in the blue light . But then everyone looks sinister in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know , is n't that right ? " I sensed threat . I played Dumb Dora . " I know so little , particularly about the early days . " Dr. Lowell nodded . " I think Jimmy . . . no , let 's call him Kalki . He is Kalki , after all . Jimmy 's real gift was for chemistry . We both realized that during his first year in premed when he developed a completely new hallucinogen from  --  of all things , apricots . " " A what ? " " A drug . " Dr. Lowell mentioned without embarrassment the subject of our midnight visit . " He had a genius . . . well , no , not a genius but a definite flair for improvising drugs that would cause hallucinations . I is would make them out of the most unlikely ingredients . But then he went into the army and that was that . " " Did he take drugs ? " " That is a delicate question , under the circumstances . " Dr. Lowell opened a drawer in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my imaginary gun . Instead , he produced a bottle of Scotch , and two glasses . " Now , let us have some of the licensed drug , thep106nirvana of Middle America  --  booze ! " He laughed , dismally . There was something depressing about Dr. Lowell ; and familiar . He poured us each a glass . " To Kalki ! " he said . We touched glasses , and drank . " Dr. Lowell . " I swallowed hard , not used to straight whiskey . Arlene actually gargled with tequila . As a result , her voice had dropped half an octave in less than ten years . " I am aware of the reputation of this shop ... " " Finest tropical birds and fish in the world . They come straight from the jungles of the Amazon to your ranch-style house , to your high-rise apartment , to your lonely bed  --  sitting room . " The light from above made his eyes invisible . " We ship anywhere . " " I saw Jason McCloud in Katmandu . I saw him in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evening . Look . I have a problem . Forget the Sun . I do n't have to go on with the pieces . But I 've signed a contract with Kalki Enterprises . I am supposed to be working for the reincarnation of Vishnu . A bit much , but who knows ? Now let me put my cards on the table . If this whole religious thing is just a front for a drug syndicate , what happens to me when Senator White 's committeelowers the boom ? I 'm going to be like the innocent guy in the getaway car who goes to Sing Sing . " I was relieved , having come ( relatively ) clean . Dr. Lowell shut his invisible eyes . " I see , " he said , " your problem . I respect it . Let me try to be helpful . Kalki has no connection with this shop . It is my show entirely . It is true that McCloud is working for the White committee . The committee and Senator White need headlines . I am thought to deal in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep in touch . Ergo , Kalki is not the avatar of the all high but a drug-pusher . For several months McCloud and White have been biding their time . As the publicity for Kalki builds , so will the publicity for their committeehearings . White intends to be the fortieth  --  or is it the forty-first ? president of this great republic . McCloud intends to rise with him . If , of course , McCloud is not a double agent himself . " " Taking money from you ? I saw the attache case . " I stuck my neck into the noose . But then the whiskey had made me reckless ; and sleepy . Dr. Lowell took my accusation in his considerable smooth stride . " It is customary for the American businessman to pay off government investigators , no matter how innocent his business . McCloud is quite capable of setting me up . " to )  |p107I  nodded . " The cop with the roach , " I said . " I beg your pardon ? " Dr. Lowell was getting a bit blurry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But I could not for the life of me say what I meant because I had been drugged . Just as I lost consciousness , I realized that Dr. Lowell was Dr. Ashok.  |p108HAD  I BEEN LESS ILL , I MIGHT HAVE TAKEN A CERTAIN PLEASURE INDr . Lowell 's old-fashioned sense of melodrama . He had not , as they say , missed a trick . First , I had been drugged by a member of the legendary family of Michael Finn . Second , I had been put to bed in a Scandinavian-stylemodern bedroom . Third , ominously , I was wearing a black lace nightgown unknown to fashion since the forties , the period of Dr. Lowell 's awakening manhood . Had I been raped ? Probably . My entire pelvic area was sore . God alone knew what lecherous games Dr. Lowell had played . I wanted to throw up . I felt feverish . A female voice came to me , as if through a yard of wool . " How do you feel , Mrs. Ottinger ? " " Like death , " I replied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( ? ) as a trained nurse . " I 'll tell Dr. Lowell . " She left the room . I shut my eyes . I wanted only to sleep . To lose consciousness again . To escape the aches , chills , fevers . The next thing I knew , Dr. Lowell was sitting beside my bed . 1 lcp109took my pulse . He seemed genuinely concerned with my health . " I was drugged ? " I had difficulty talking . I was also seeing double . " Yes . I 'm afraid I had to . But you 've also been ill . Nothing to do with the drug . Believe me . Some form of influenza . I do n't know what kind . Something you must 've picked up in Nepal . " " From a Legionnaire . " I thought this amusing , but he did not . He checked out my reflexes , vision , hearing . He was more reassured than not . " You 're all right , " he said . " Thank God . I was scared to death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had to get you out of New Orleans . Away from McCloud . " " Out of New Orleans ? " I was not really taking any of this in . " Yes . We 're in Washington , D.C. In a suite at the Jefferson Arms , a hotel which belongs to Kalki Enterprises . " " Does the Sun know ? " " They know you 've been sick . " Dr. Lowell produced a hypodermic needle . I let him shoot me up . " You should feel better in a few minutes . " I assumed that he had given me speed . I did not ask . " What about McCloud ? " " He was going to kill you . He is a hit man , working for the Chinese . " I let this nonsense slip by , unacknowledged . " Why am I here ? " Dr. Lowell put away the hypodermic needle . Then he sat back in his chair , and gave me what he no doubt thought was a beguiling smile . " You are a Perfect Master , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stared at me , with the yellowy eyes of Dr. Ashok . I shut my own eyes , seeing if not double , doubleness . " Kalki said I would meet a Perfect Master in New Orleans . He did not tell me that I 'd also be drugged , kidnapped . . . raped ? " Thus did I take the famed bull by his identifying horns . I know by heart Ms. Brownrniller 's book on men , and rape . " No . You were not raped . Beautiful as you are . May I call you Teddy ? " " Call me anything you like . But what do I call you ? Dr. Lowell or Dr. Ashok ? " " My disguise proved penetrable ! " Dr. Lowell was undistressed . " So be it . I am Dr. Ashok in Nepal because Dr. Lowell is persona non gratap110in that magical land . Hence , I must travel there in disguise . I am also an agent of the CIA , on a part-time basis . They do not connect me with Dr. Lowell . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Lowell ignored the challenge . " From the beginning Kalki wanted us to meet . That is why I was on the plane to New Delhi . He wanted me to observe you . I did . I told him that I thought you were a Perfect Master . " " How , " I asked , " can a non-Hindu atheist be a Perfect Master ? " " We are all Hindus , whether we know it or not . That is a fact , like creation . It is also a fact that the one god has three aspects and that the current incarnation of one of those three aspects is Kalki . Dear Teddy , do n't frown so ! I know it takes some getting used to . When Jimmy told me that he was Kalki ... that was on his last trip to the States , in 1970 , I thought he was mad . " " Can I take notes ? " Weak as I was , I felt some obligation to Morgan . " As your doctor , I must say , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . " Lowell thought this sufficiently amusing to punctuate with a laugh . " Like you , I said to Jimmy , I 'm not a Hindu . ' I also told Kalki that he was not a Hindu , either , except by conversion . He said that that was not the point . We are who we are , and we have always been who we are throughout eternity . Sometimes we know . Sometimes we do n't . We need enlightenment . That is what the word Buddha means , the one who has been enlightened . " " Then you . . . we are all Buddhas ? " " On the threshold . Except for Kalki , of course . He is god . " Lowell said this with all the quiet authority that Michel Foucault would have us associate with the truly mad or sane . I very much wanted to look at myself in the mirror . " Was he Kalki at Tulane ? " My skin felt dry . I tried but failed to see a reflection of myself in the stethoscope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But he did n't know it . Or so he says . I certainly never suspected . He was quite ordinary , outside of his lab work . " " He studied ballet . " " Next to mime , I hate ballet . If there is a hell being prepared for me , it will be an eternity of watching Marcel Marccau alternate with the Bolshoi Ballet . " Lowell took a firmer line than I would have . Yet we were not too far apart in our tastes.  | " Did you see Kalki before 1970 ? " " I used to hear from him . Or about him . From Estelle , a nice girl . I 'm sorry for her . So is Kalki . I mean , it 's not her fault she was not Lakshmi . " " Kalki might have let her know early on . Women are usually quick to take a hint . " " He did n't know . So how could he tell her ? When he realized he was Kalki and that his eternal wife was Lakshmi , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a job , which I was happy to do . I invade no privacy when I say that Estelle and I have been very close to one another since I opened the shop . " " Women , " I said , from the heart , " have a lousy time in this world . " " Then be glad that it is ending . " " You could at least marry Estelle . " " Too late . The end ... " " Sure . Sure . But what about ten years ago ? She would have liked that . " I was fighting the sisters ' battle . Lowell was losing his suavity . " Estelle is Catholic . I 'm not . I 've also had a vasectomy . There could be no children . What is the point ? " " If you do n't see the point , I ca n't explain it to you . Men are such shits . Give me a mirror . " Lowell brought me a hand mirror . I was duly depressed . " I look like death . Where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near death , Teddy . If you had n't been a Perfect Master , you would have died . " " If you had n't drugged me , I 'd never have been sick . " " I swear there was no connection . " Lowell wanted very much for me to believe him , but I did not . For some obscure reason , I had been made ill . For reasons equally obscure , I had been made well again . I had a sudden hot flush , or flash . The drug he had just given me was going into high gear . Suddenly I felt euphoric , and full of energy . " I still do n't understand how I happen to be a Perfect Master . " Lowell actually shrugged , something one only hears of in H.V.W. land . But then I ) r . Giles Lowell was a melodramatist and so at home in that lurid country . " I do n't know , either . Kalki suspected it when lie read your book , which I 've not got around to yet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you are one of the Five Perfect Masters.  |p112Do  n't ask me how I know . I just do . Your trip to New Orleans proved that Kalki was right . That you and I and Geraldine were chosen from the beginning to preside over The End . We have no real choice in the matter . Of us all , only Kalki has the freedom to act , to surprise . But even though he is god , he is obliged  --  like it or not  --  to act out the never-ending cycle of birth and death and rebirth . As Vishnu , he is lord of the universe . As Kalki , he is Vishnu temporarily encased in a man 's flesh . The Jesus story is just a variation on the Kalki story . " To stimulate circulation , to clear my brain of the drug , I waved my arms in the air . As I did , the left sleeve of the black lace night dress fell back , revealing a blue-black bruise in the crook of my arm . " What 's that ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first one I gave you was on the plane when you woke up . Remember ? " I was panicky . " What plane ? " " The one from New Orleans to Washington , a private plane belonging to Kalki Enterprises . I 'm afraid that 's when you took ill . Yourtemperature went to 104 . There were respiratory difficulties ... " I was beginning to feel unreal again . " How long have I been here ? " " Six days . " " My God ! I 've got to get up ! I 've got to talk to Morgan Davies . " " In time . At the moment you 're going to talk to someone a lot more interesting than Mr. Davies . I 've made an appointment for you to have breakfast tomorrow morning with Senator Johnson White , at the MayflowerHotel . I 've also spoken to Mr. Davies . He was thrilled about your coming interview with White . Because it all ties in with Kalki , and your pieces for the Sun . " " You 've taken quite a lot on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Giles . Where 's my luggage ? " " Everything 's here . " Lowell got to his feet . " If there 's anything you need , just let me know . Or the nurse . " Sitting here in the Cabinet Room at the White House , I still have some difficulty in arranging the pieces of the puzzle . A passage from Jules Renard : " When I notice something ridiculous , I notice it only much later . I do not observe a moment while I am living it . It is only later that I go over every detail of my life . " That is what I anm doing now , having saved that life . But I must confess that a good deal of whatp113I observed in Washington and later in New York struck me as surreal . But then it was meant to . Namah Shivayah . To be translated later . THE NEXT MORNING , AS I WALKED DOWN WISCONSIN AVENUE , HADanyone said that in a year 's time I 'd be working here at the White I louse , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is precisely the kind of hindsight I have been asked to avoid . I will stick only to the facts , as they occurred . My model will be Jules Renard ; a man not given to metaphor or to Weissisms . " The romantic , " wrote Renard , " looks at a large mirror and believes it to be the sea . The realist looks at the sea and believes it to be a mirror . But the man with a straightforward mind says , in front of the mirror : It is a mirror ! ' and in front of the sea : It is the sea . ' " In Washington I was faced with a United States senator who wanted to be the next Republican candidate for president . That is straightforward . To continue forward in the straightest way possible , I should say right here that I always disliked politicians . They took up too much time on the talk shows , avoiding subjects and otherwise projecting personalities best left unprojected beyond the cozy confines of some small-town Kiwanis club . I was known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pilot who had broken records . I had risked my life , testing planes . But no politician from the President on down had ever actually done anything tangible . A parasitic trade , I always thought , snatching them smile for smile on the tube . Senator White was already seated at a table in the breakfast room of the Mayflower Hotel . He was alone . Later I was told that this was a great honor , for me . Usually senators ( particularly the presidential ones ) were surrounded not only by people who wanted something from the government but also by their own staff whose task it was to get , by crook or by hook , their senator 's name into the newspapers and hisp114face onto television . This is quite a trick when you consider that no senator actually did anything worth noting . In any case , with a total of one hundred senators , the competition was fierce . To survive , each statesman had to get , at least once a year , thirty to forty seconds on the 6:oo News , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by side with Walter Cronkite , the most trusted man in the nation because for each of five nights a week he nicely read the news for a total of seven minutes . White was a short , thick man with tiny hands and feet , and a very big head . He was about fifty years old . As I approached , he displayed the politician 's standard set of white capped teeth : too white , too glossy , too regular , so unlike the artful dental masterpieces that are parcel and part of the California landscape . White dyed his own hair , always a mistake . But then American politicians tended to look like TV anchormen on the cheap ; too many corners cut too often . Contact lenses made White 's eyes look larger and glassier than Mother Nature had intended . Oh , what a wondrous work is man ! wrote a man . I always thought that Americans would have been better off with a dictatorship somewhat on the order of Indira Gandhi 's brief fling . After all , hardly anyone would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there would have been only one excruciating bore , taking up time on television instead of thousands . I suppose Saint-Exupery was right . We fliers are not democrats . At thirty thousand feet , the world is an anthill . From outer space the world is a blue-green marble . All in all , I suppose it was a lucky thing that except for Lindbergh ( briefly ) fliers have stayed away from politics . Of course , Amelia did work in settlement houses , helping the poor . But then she was a saint , in a bad time . I introduced myself to Senator White . He half-rose from the table ; half-blinded me with three thousand white teeth as he thrummed a welcome in the politician 's standard ( i.e. , deep and slightly monotonous ) voice . I have noticed . . . no , it was Arlene who pointed out to me the curious fact that whoever is the most popular politician at any given moment is imitated by all the others . I can remember when senators as far afield as California were imitating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a twice-born redneck from the South was in residence at the White House , a large number of presidential senators affected Southern accents . Senator Johnson White of Michi/gan and the Harvard Law School had worked out a bumpkin number that chilled the blood in my veins . " The corned beef hash here is real good , " he said , drawing out the vowels . I shuddered . Ordered coffee . As we drank our coffee and cased one another , he made it perfectly clear ( through body language ) that I could be , if not a president 's mistress , a candidate 's lay . I swung my leg as far from his as I could . Then I switched on my tape recorder . I smiled brightly . If I were a man , I can not imagine anything less aphrodisiacal than a woman with a tape recorder . " I hear you 've just come from New Orleans . " This came out dry and clear . But then White remembered he was just folks and running for president . " A swell town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real good . " " Do they ? " I signaled him as best I could that I was not a potential supporter . White dropped the fried mush . " I 'm a great admirer of Morgan Davies . " This was said with warmth , sincerity ; but then everything he said was warm , sincere . " I think he 's done a bang-up job with his ... uh , periodicals . I read the Sun faithfully . A little far-out politically for my taste . He 's too much in with those eco-freaks , but he 's tough on drugs . And so am I. And I think that you were an inspired choice to investigate and expose the drug racket for him . " " Not drugs , Senator . " I spoke softly . In the opposite booth a halfdozenprofessional constituents were staring at us . They had recognized White . They envied me . " My assignment is to cover Kalki , and the end of the world . " White gave me a conspirator 's smile . " Sure . Sure . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over Hanoi was the extent of his cockpit expertise . Politicians always called you by your first name . " Do you realize , Teddy , " and he looked grave , discouraged , the way all the presidents were obliged to look after talking to their opposite number in the Kremlin , " that Kalki , and the end of the world , are going to get eleven and a half minutes on CBS 's 6o Minutes to be aired this Sunday ? " White looked ready to cut his wrists . " Kalki 's a good performer . " I was cool . " And the subject has a certain interest . " Understatement never went over very well with politicians . " Those billboards ! " White looked in pain . " Do you know what it costs to havep116twenty thousand billboards across the country in full color ? Not even Dick Nixon in ' 71 spent that kind of money . " " I 'm told that you think Kalki and Dr. Lowell are in the drug business . " I lifted my ball-point ; held it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ White , " that the whole point to your expose in the Sun was the fact that the New Orleans Tropical Bird and Fish Companyis a front for one of the largest drug syndicates in the world . I also thought that my friend Morgan would have told you by now that we expect you to hold off with your revelations until after my committee has held its first hearings in New York , and called Kelly or Kalki as a witness , in two weeks ' time . " I was disturbed by the reference to Morgan . Had White made some sort of deal with Morgan behind my back ? If he had , that would explain why I had not been able to talk directly to Morgan since I left L.A. All messages were passed through the stoned Sapersteen , a faulty conduitif there ever was one . " Jason McCloud told me about the hearings . " " A dedicated public servant . " There was a snap to White 's voice . " He is also the only black ever to infiltrate the Hong Kong branch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have got the goods on Kelly and Lowell . " " Why ? " That simple question stopped the would-be president . " Why what ? " White swiveled around to get a good look at me . " Why go to the trouble of starting a religious movement if you have already put together a successful drug syndicate ? " " Because , Teddy , " White bit hard on the words as they emerged from his wide presidential mouth , " religion is tax-exempt . " " Oh . " I do n't know why one automatically assumes that a candidate for president is stupid . It never occurred to me that Johnson White could have figured out something that I had not . But he had . And it made perfect sense . " Then Kalki 's a kind of genius , for having thought this up . " " Or Lowell . We think Lowell is the brains in New Orleans while Kalki 's the man in the field . And , of course , the performer on television . Eleven and a half minutes . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the precious minutes of prime time that Kalki had got , and he had not . He sighed . Then he gave the word . ' ' They launderp117money through their American ashrams . They pretend it comes from foreign contributors . Since any bona fide religion is tax-exempt in the United States , they are home-free . Meanwhile , they are diversifying their very rich portfolio . In the last year they have been buying up choice real estate , growth businesses , warehouses and western North Dakota . Teddy , this thing is an octopus . And you 've got to help me . And you 've got to help your country . And you 've got to help those poor kids who 've been hooked on brown sugar , and worse . " Even though the tourists at the table opposite could not hear exactly what was being said , they could detect the patriotic hum to White 's voice , as measured and as gooseflesh-making as the opening bars of The Battle Hymn of the Republic . I could see that they wanted to applaud . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Senator , what the Sun intends to do . That 's between you and Mr. Davies . All I do is collect material . They write it up . " " You can be a big help , Teddy . " He lapsed into twice-born redneck lingo . " Help " pronounced as " hepp . " " You a goo ' lookin ' gal . Mighty goo ' lookin ' . " A one-night or rather a one-morning stand was in the air again . U.S. Senators had the reputation of being not only sexually insatiable but impotent . Years ago Arlene had had an affair with a senator from Arizona . She told me all . " Senator , you 're crushing my dress . " White 's leg swung away from me . " What , " he asked , " were you doing the last few days with Giles Lowell ? And how and when did you get to Washington ? " " I think , Senator , that that is for me to know and you to find out . " " Then in due @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Control Committee and obliged to testify under oath . " " First Amendment . Must protect my sources . " I gave the journalists ' creed , in a somewhat sketchy way . " Supreme Court 's decision in this matter still undefined , " White rattled the familiar response . " You can be held in contempt of Congress . " Then he flashed me a loving twice-born smile . A tear or two of love for me and the whole human race came to his eyes . " But I do n't want us to he in an adversary situation , Teddy , because I 've got the greatest admiration for you as an aviatrix , and American . " " Thanks . " I was vinegar to his oil . " I 've got nothing interesting to report on Dr. IAmen I flew with him in a private plane to Washington.  |p118I  've been staying at the Jefferson Arms . Room 437 . This is not an invitation . The last few days I 've been sick with flu and Dr. Lowell acted as my physician . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretty certain that they are into drugs . I now understand why they started a religion in order to launder money . Everything is absolutely clear except one thing . Why the end of the world ? " " It 's catchy . Everybody in the country 's talking about those billboards . Every TV comedian is making jokes about The End . It 's like Evel Knievel . On such-and-such a day you 're going to shoot yourself out of a cannon . With that kind of announcement , you can build yourself up quite a gate . And then those Lotus Lotteries ! Everybody 's hooked on them . I almost won five thousand dollars last week . I was just one number off . " " But what happens , Senator , when the end does n't happen ? " " The guy 's had a good run for your money . " White saw only the promotional side to Kalki . But then that was his business , too  --  selfpromotion . " Well , I think Kalki 's serious . I think he really believes that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ running out of energy and food . There are too many people , too much pollution ... " I should have been warned by White 's earlier reference to eco-freaks . The volcano erupted : " I know . I know . Club of Rome . Ecology . Overpopulation . Oil pollution . Everybody in Michigan poisoned from the PBB in the milk . No fish in the Mediterranean . Elsewhere , high mercuryand cadmium count in most of the world 's fish . Woman on a diet died from eating too much swordfish . DDT poisoning of the water sources of the First World due to advanced agricultural techniques . Diminished intelligence in the population of the Third World as a result of increased carbon monoxide leading to permanent changes in the weather and the beginning of a new Ice Age while the ozone layer in the stratosphere is being burnt away by the exhaust of jets like the supersonic Concorde . Teddy , all of this is just plain old-fashioned commie horseshit and I 'm surprised that a good American and Californianlike you would fall for it . Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defeat us ? They want to worry us . They want us to stop expanding the greatest industrial plant the world has ever seen in order to save these toads and moths and useless varieties of birds and fish from extinction . But , Teddy , we are the ones on the brink of extinctionp119if we cut back now and lose the battle for the control of the consumer markets of the world . The choice is a simple one . Between these toads and moths and useless varieties of birds and fish and a society that offers you everything in the electrical appliance line as well as more hours of free TV than any other nation on earth , on top of which we have a superb military machine second to none , not to mention a standard of living that is the envy of every commie and the despair of every Third Worlder . Teddy , you just ca n't sell out America for a mess of porridge ! " Senator White 's command of language was presidential . He also had a coherent world vision . And flawless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had missed my point . " I am almost persuaded by your eloquence , " I said . " And that 's a compliment , because I am an eco-freak . But when I said that the end of the world was at hand , I was n't just speaking of what everyone knows . I mean , even the American Congress must suspect that everything is running down . No , I meant something much simpler . I meant a real end to the world , thanks to Kalki . " White began to sprinkle hayseed over me . " Honey lamb , " he said , " if you think Mistuh Kalki is gon na switch off the human race you got another think comin ' . Because , " and now the voice was no longer twice-born but that of President White , speaking to his people , " there is no way of ending human life on this planet short of unleashing America 's nuclear might against the hordes of international communism  --  anoption which I would never rule out , let me say , as reluctant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fall to me as commander-in-chief to make the fateful decision . " The tourists at the next table applauded , quietly . White lowered his voice . " Kelly ca n't end the world . It 's not technically possible . Even if he had a dozen neutron bombs , Model B , he could n't . I know . I 've had it checked out with the Pentagon . But the question 's academic , because he does n't even have one bomb . Do n't ask how I know , but I know . " I picked up on the phrase " Model B. " I had come out against the deployment of the original neutron bomb . Although the N-bomb satisfactorilyif painfully kills personnel ( as opposed to people ) and leaves intact buildings , the neutron bomb 's radioactive fallout may last a thousand years in the atmosphere . " Model B ? You do n't mean there 's a new model ? " " I did not say Model 13 , Teddy . " White lied snux ) thly " Either youp120misheard or I misspoke . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the safety of the free world now rests with that li'l . . . little shaver of a neutron bomb that respects property . And those who oppose it are mostly commies and all their fellow travelers at the Washington Post and the New York Times . " Senator White 's mind tended to work in familiar if irrelevant circles . " The Concorde is not only a great aircraft but no proven danger to the environment while the aerosol can is as safe as houses according to disinterested observers in industry . That was room 437 at the Jefferson Arms ? " This last was murmured affectionately . " I 'm off to New York , " I gave him a radiant smile . " A rain check , " I murmured , too . I thought it wise to con him . I was not eager for a subpoena . Or penis . With a flourish , I paid the check . I had been warned by Giles that senators never paid for anything . He thanked me . As we were leaving , White maneuvered himself so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fans were thrilled . " We 're behind you , Senator , " said one . " You got ta be president , " said another . " Give ' em hell , Teddy ! " said a third . White 's face looked grim . I thought it was because I had been recognized , too . " I still have my fans . " I rubbed it in . " That was n't for you . " White actually succeeded in achieving a Weissean snap . " That guy thought I was Teddy Kennedy . A nation , " said Senator Johnson White not so very far under his breath , " of fucking morons . " In front of the hotel , White held my hand for a long time as he said farewell . " You keep in touch , Teddy . " The doorman , several passers-by and I were then treated to one final redneck aria . " And you think over what I been tellin ' you . ' Cause , Teddy , with your hepp I wan na mekk a country as good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me and as this great country can be and will be once we have restored it to you and to me and to the people who make up this the greatest nation in the history of the country . " What he said made , of course , no sense . But as of last March that was the way not only the front-running Republican candidate for president was sounding but just about every other politician as well . As entropy increases , energy hemorrhages . Language is affected . Words become mere incantation . When that happens , the end is near , and the cold.  |p121ARRIVED  IN NEW YORK TO FIND MYSELF AGAIN IN DEMAND ONtelevision . My good words for Indira Gandhi had been forgiven if not forgotten . Everyone wanted to interview the interviewer of Kalki . The billboards had made a great impression . I had four minutes on The Today Show , six on Good Morning , America . I also had lunch with Morgan Davies in the Oak Room of the Plaza Hotel , a pleasant room with carved wood paneling as yet unreproduced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which was unbecoming . " The response is terrific . Kalki is The End ! " He laughed at what was already a fairly tired national joke . I gave him the latest news . He was pleased . " We should get a picture of Mrs. Kelly . " Morgan wrote a note on a piece of paper . " And I like that bit about Kalki being an ex-dancer . I suppose his old ballet school would have some pictures . " He made another note . " Is he a fag ? " " No , Morgan . " Several times during lunch , the maitre d ' came to the table and whispered in Morgan 's ear that there was a telephone call . Morgan would then pick up the telephone beside his chair and discuss whether or not the President was going to dump the Vice-President before the next convention . That was the only subject that interested the power brokers last year . Kalki was just a sideshow . " Johnson White will get the Republican nomination , " said Davies , hanging up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President had at last decided to replace the Vice-President . " But only if these hearings of his really take off . " " Will they ? " " That depends on you . On Kalki . On the FBI , the CIA , the I ) EA , the IKS . Everybody 's doing White 's work for hint . But even if he 's nominated , I do n't see him heating the Presidentp122unless . . . " Morgan kindly gave me an analysis of the great American political game . Although I was an enthusiastic part of that majority of the electorate who were not apathetic yet never voted because there was no point , I listened politely . Morgan really cared . But then he had no imagination . When Morgan was finished , I asked about the drug connection . " White told me that you had agreed to hold back until the hearings . " " Did he ? " Morgan chuckled . Chuck ? Chuck ? Chuck ? That is not at all the way he sounded . Chuckled is bad onomatopoeia , based @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ century . I just looked the word up in the President 's personal dictionary in the Oval Office . " Senator White wo n't like that . " " Screw Senator White . " Morgan 's eyes were those of a cobra contemplating a mongoose . " I ca n't tell you how much I admire your work , Teddy . " He laid it on . He told me that there would definitely be a book . He had arranged everything with Doubleday . They were just waiting for me to sign the contract . The fact that I was Kalki 's pilot , telling all , had been a " topnotch selling point , " according to Morgan . I thanked him . He suggested that I get in touch with Dr. Lowell , who was in town . " He 'll be at the main ashram . That 's Fifty-Third Street , just off First Avenue . By the way , we 're inclined to think Lowell 's the real boss . " " That 's what Senator White thinks . " " Johnny , " Morgan always called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrong , you know . " He laughed ; then he wheezed ( only a neologism could describe the sound , but I am no neologician ) . " Even so , never trust Johnny . For one thing , he 's on the take . From the drug interests . " " Everybody 's corrupt . " I was not really surprised . Just depressed . " Well , it 's only a rumor . But we 're checking it out . The theory is that the White campaign is being financed by the Chao Chow gang in Hong Kong . They want to eliminate Kalki Enterprises . So they 're paying Johnny to go after him . Johnny will get his headlines . Kalki and Lowell will go to jail . Johnny will become president . The Chao Chow will regain control of the world drug business . That 's the scenario . If it 's true . Anyway , we 've put an investigator on it . We got this onep123made . In fact , our only worry is that Kalki will get himself hit before the Madison @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obit ? " Oh , we were playing hard ball all right . Morgan gasped ( better word ) with amusement . " No . Bruce will write the obit . But we 'll run a full-length photo of you in your black leather pilot 's jacket , with boots , looking sad and kinky . Bereft pilot ... " Lunch ended on that high note . I noticed that Morgan was beginning to develop a certain blueness about the lips , and it occurred to me that the Sun might soon be in need of a new editor . I walked across town to the ashram . I was recognized from the various television programs that I had done . Quite a few people wanted to talk to me about Kalki . If nothing else , he had caught if not fired the imagination of sophisticated New Yorkers . It took me an hour to walk a dozen blocks . The ashram was three narrow tenement buildings knocked together . The entrance hall was done in beige . Opposite the main door was a life-size color photograph of Kalki ; he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him hit . Posters announced the rally : KALKI ! MADISON SQUARE GARDEN , MARCH 15 . End of the World . A long table was covered with free pamphlets : " Who Is Kalki ? , " " After the End , " " Before the End . " There was a lotus-dispenser in the center of the room . On top of the dispenser was a list of the previous week 's lucky numbers . As of that date , more than a million dollars had been distributed in the Lotus I , otteries . Consequently , the Kalki boys and girls no longer had to worry about getting their message across . They were mobbed in the streets . Everyone wanted to draw a lucky lotus . Male and female receptionists wore fixed Scientological smiles beneathempty e s t-ian eyes . They managed the traffic . Interested people came and went ; took pamphlets ; asked about classes ; bought tickets for the Madison Square Garden rally ; collected lotuses . The Muzak was loud with Sergeant Pepper . I presented myself to a large young man with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . He beamed . Or gleamed . " Teddy Ottinger ! Pranam ! Pranam ! What an honor ! What a pleasure ! I just now caught you on 77ie A.M. Show . " fie was beside us both with religious ecstasy.  | " I 'll take you right up . Dr. Lowell 's only just arrived . Now you 're here ! Two Perfect Masters ! What joy ! I ca n't wait for The End ! " Yes , that is exactly what he said . I was tempted to interview him on the spot . When he spoke of The End , did he see himself dead ? Or did he see the sky opening up and a staircase descending ? Or did he just think that come April 3 ( a date still unrevealed ) there would be a change for the good in the human race ? I regret that I never really analyzed either in depth or in shallow a typical Kalki-ite as of last year . I was led through various offices , equipped with all the latest communicationdevices . Ticker-tape machines extruded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and women served the machines quietly , impressively . My guide left me in front of a door on which a brass plate proclaimed PERFECT MASTER . I knocked ; and entered . Giles lay full-length on a sofa , talking on the telephone . When he saw me , he said into the receiver , " Teddy Ottinger , Perfect Master , just walked in the room . " There was a pause ; then he turned to me . " Lakshmi sends you a special greeting . " When Giles had finished talking to Katmandu , he bounded to his feet ; he was jittery with energy , excitement . He showed me a proof of the latest poster for Kalki 's Madison Square Garden engagement . " Jazzy ? " " Very , " I said , and it was . Kalki and The End got top billing . Then four rock groups were listed . I am not into rock . But Giles assured me , " They 're all sensational ! Out of sight ! Eight gold records between them ! We 'll be selling their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 've cut of Kalki 's end-of-the-world rap , complete with flute and sitar . " I was privileged to observe Giles in yet another metamorphosis . He was now Mr. Show Biz . He paced down and up the room . He talked of box-office receipts . Record sales . TV promos . I almost ( almost but not quite ) wished that Dr. Ashok was back in town . Meanwhile , aides kept coming and going , showing him bits of paper . " For your approval , Perfect Master . " Finally , Giles told a secretary in the outer office to hold all calls except those from Katmandu . " So how was your lunch with Senator White ? " " He 's going to subpoena Kalki . He 's going to try to nail you both as traffickers in drugs . "  | " Poor Johnny . Anything for a headline . When is he holding those hearings ? " " Next week , right after the rally . " Giles frowned . He was no longer Mr. Show Biz . " We 'll have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3 ? " Giles nodded . " Well , we 'll just have to put our thinking caps on . God , you 're attractive , Teddy . " I was chased once around the room . Fortunately , it was not his heart but his adrenalin that was in the pursuit , and he soon gave it up . He collapsed upon the sofa . I sat demurely in a straight chair . After a day at Arden 's , I looked myself again . The dryness of skin and hair was gone . I felt good . I was now Teddy Ottinger , Glamorous Newshen . " Senator White is convinced that this religious movement is just a front for the drug syndi-cate . " Giles would have laughed had he not been winded from the chase . " Reverse the sentence and you 'll be closer to the truth . " " Drugs are a front for Kalki ? " But Giles clammed up as he always did when Topic A was mentioned . Reluctantly , I moved on to Topic B. " I 'm trying to make sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sincere in manner , a trick I had learned from watching Arlene do television commercials . " Why , if the world is coming to an end on April 3 , are you so busy selling tickets , records , making money ? " Giles 's fingers combed his few remaining tufts of gray hair . " We  --  and that means you , too  --  have a divine mission . We have been put on earth at this time in order to purify people , to help them achieve inner peace and serenity so that when the new cycle begins they can he reborn as Brahmins , thereby restoring the original Golden Age . " This nonsense flowed as smoothly as organic honey . " I hear what you 're saying , Giles . " I affected an even deeper sincerity . I sounded to myself like a Malibu surfer discussing ways of getting together his/her inner space . " But it still does n't make any sense . " Teddy , nothing will ever make any sense if you do n't accept the fact that our souls are born @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ busy selling tickets , records ... "  | . " There 's also a lot of money in this racket . " I replaced sincerity with toughness . Giles thought this funny . " A lot of money ? You ought to see our audit sheets ! We 're hopelessly in debt . We also have another problem , thanks to Johnny White . " Giles opened a door behind his desk . At a long table in the next room a dozen tired-looking men sat examining ledgers , working hand computers . They looked at us , without pleasure . " Accountants , " he said . " From the Internal Revenue Service . How 's it going , Mr. Prager ? " Mr. Prager was a small brown cricket of a man . He sat at the head of the table . " We are making progress , Dr. Lowell . Never fear . " The voice was not friendly . " I just hope you 're not too confused , Mr. Prager . " " Quite the contrary , Dr. Lowell . " Giles shut the door . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Poor bastard . He has met his match . You do n't mind if we provide you with security . " It took me a moment to adjust to this Ashokian switch of subject . " A bodyguard ? " Giles nodded . " You wo n't find them a bother . But they 'll be on the job twenty-four hours a day . That 's why we 've booked you into the Americana Hotel . It 's set up for total security . " " Why ? " " McCloud is in town . Better to be safe , dear Teddy , than ... " " You have never given a convincing reason why McCloud is after me . " I did not add that Giles Lowell had yet to give a convincing explanation of anything . He lied as effortlessly as little birds sing . " He 's after all of us . " Giles was suddenly vague . Topic A was again in the air . " Does he know that you 're Dr. Ashok ? " " How could he ? " Giles went into his Ashok @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Remember , dear Madame Ottinger ? The narc has no idea that his friendly associate in Nepal Dr. Ashok of the CIA is also his principal quarry in New Orleans Dr. Lowell . " " Then , " I said , " McCloud 's a lot dumber than he looks . " " That is often the case . Anyway , watch out for him . And now for the good news . Geraldine arrives tomorrow . " I was delighted . I hadp127missed her . I had dreamed about her several times . I had not dreamed about Kalki once . What , I wondered , did that mean ? Nothing , or something ? In dreams begin . . . all things . Giles gave me an office in the ashram . PERFECT MASTER was on the door . I was introduced to various mandali . I felt an imposter . They were all so thrilled to know me . " It 's like a blessing to be able to talk to a Perfect Master , " said one starry-eyed girl . I fled the ashram ; paid a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least no one around there felt that it was a blessing to know me . Curse was more like it . " I mean , it 's a real drag , Teddy , for me to be working my ass off writing those pieces and then you get all the credit . " Bruce sniffed angrily . Then he gave me my fan mail . Most of it was from fundamentalistChristians who were praying for me as they stitched their hoods , lit their crosses , planned pogroms . One letter gave me enormous satisfaction : " I can not help but say well done , Teddy ! ' Your sentences hit the nail on the head each and every time . You write like I dream . Ever yours , Herman Victor Weiss . " MOST SOUTHERN CALIFORNIANS DISLIKED NEW YORK CITY . I WASwith the majority on that one . For one thing , the weather is uniformly depressing except for the fall . Unfortunately , I had never visited the city at that time of year and so I was obliged to take on faith the glories of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the thrill of firstnighting . A mysterious phrase . Reference to the seduction of a virgin ? March was cold . Windy . Gray . All blueness had gone out of the sky . Clouds and smog encased Manhattan Island like a celluloid bell . Shreds of newspapers floated on the wind . Everything that could be broken or bent had been broken and bent , at least at eye level . The garbage had not been collected for some weeks . The collectors were striking for money , human dignity . In their place , I would have emigrated . Despite the weather , the dirt , the discomfort , I was in a splendid mood . I was with Geraldine , and the high mood of the high mountains had , somewhat , returned . She was also staying at the Americana ; she , too , had a discreet bodyguard . All in all , I was more pleased than not to be followed at all times by a large black man in a turtleneck sweater , carrying a walkie-talkie . There was a sense of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I always walked . Unlike most Southern Californians , I prefer walking to driving.  |p129Geraldine  and I met in the main lobby of the Americana . She was dressed like a young Junior League matron from Connecticut , of the sort you saw only  --  or at least I saw only  --  in magazines like Town 6 Country . Although the East Coast and its social arrangements were a mystery to me , I liked to read the gossip , and look at the pictures of weddings , horse shows , gracious living among Hepplewhite consoles and golden retrievers . I was very much aware of the Geraldines , out there in Connecticut . We embraced . " I am glad to see you , Teddy ! " She was warmth itself . I liked the dark green tweed coat that she was wearing . I liked the fact that she smelled slightly of sandalwood , the Kalki smell . I wondered if he had seduced her , too . And if he had , did I care ? Yes , I cared . But my motives were confused , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before I was able to sort things out . Meanwhile , we were together . I was in sixth if not seventh heaven , as we breakfasted at the Americana . Our guards sat at different tables , near the door . " I could n't take Nepal another minute . " Geraldine sounded grim . " Finally , Kalki told me to go . He was very sweet about it . But I felt awfully guilty , leaving him and Lakshmi . You know , we were prisoners in the ashram until Kalki finally made a call to New Delhi , to the Prime Minister . Kalki 's really popular in India . Anyway , the Indian Governmentfrightened the Nepalese . And I was allowed to leave the coun-try . " " When are Kalki and Lakshmi coming ? " " As soon as Giles finds a safe place for them here . " I drank frozen orange juice that tasted of chemicals . Last March no American would ever , willingly , squeeze an orange . " Who do you think wants to kill Kalki ? " I acted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Geraldine sighed . " Rival religious groups . We 're getting all the money , or so they say . On the other hand , Giles says we 're broke . I do n't know . I do know that Kalki is popular everywhere , particularly in Asia . Strange , is n't it ? how easily the Hindus accept Vishnu 's incarnationas a white American . They also accept the idea of The End . But then it 's the end for millions of them , anyway . I mean , half the populationis dying of malnutrition . "  |p130Geraldine  and I strolled down Fifth Avenue . Things were less broken there . In front of the Public Library , we decided to go to Madison Square Garden . Our breath was like smoke in the cold air . Geraldine said , " I want you to meet Professor Jossi , the nuclear physicist . He 's a mandalin . He 's preparing some special effects for the fifteenth . " We crossed Bryant Park , a small square of green behind the library . Tall bare trees surrounded a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ derelict . Most were black or Hispanic . Some drank wine out of bottles wrapped in brown paper bags . We sat for a moment on a bench next to a green bronze statue , streaked with white pigeon droppings . A pale sun tried but failed to burn its way through the brown haze . On the next bench , a white man was shoving a dirty hypodermic needle into a shiny swollen blue and red ankle . Nobody paid any attention . We watched , beyond horror , the parade of monsters . Drunk , drugged , mad , they staggered past us , talking to themselves . I thought it very apt that on a building opposite us was one of the KALKI , THE END billboards . I could not imagine any of these people wanting to go on . Geraldine read my mind , which was not hard . " This is n't life , " she said . " No , it 's not . " Our two guards looked alarmed . Sitting on a bench in that park , we were perfect targets for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out . " The Sun is planning to expose Kalki , as a drug-seller . " " When ? " Geraldine was cool . " After the rally . " " Kalki 's ready . " " I wish you 'd tell me the truth . " Geraldine managed a small smile . I noticed that the three freckles on the bridge of her nose made a triangle  --  Golden Triangle ? " Look , " she said , " what we were , . what we are , what we will be are three different things . I was up for tenure at M.I.T. I am a Perfect Master , sitting in Bryant Park , New York City , with another Perfect Master . After April 3 , I will be something else again . " A dozen Kalki people had entered the park . They made their way from bench to bench . They gave away pamphlets , cards with thep131addresses of the different ashrams , paper lotuses . They handled themselvesquite well , considering the hazards of that place . At this point I had accepted the fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Topic A until . when ? The End or after ? Although I had got into the habit of talking about the end , I never really took it seriously . At the most , I thought that there would be some sort of television spectacular . Then a number of explanations about a special reprieve for mankind . Or perhaps , cleverest of all , the announcement that the end had already taken place and that we were now all of us , miraculously , purified and living at the start of a new Golden Age . Who would know the difference ? I have often had the sense of having died before . Yet , curiously , I have never had a sense of birth , much less rebirth . In any case , I had figured a number of ways out of the April 3 dilemma and I assumed that Kalki had done the same . Whatever he might or might not be , he was a natural showman . Geraldine told me about herself and Lakshmi . " Doris and I went to school together , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ University . We were always very close . I would stay with her one holiday . Then she would stay with me . Even when we went to different colleges , we kept in touch . By telephone . Daily . Sometimes twice a day . She was in Chicago . I was in Boston . Then she married Jim Kelly and moved to Saigon . I really missed those long conversations . " " What on earth did you talk about ? " I hate telephones . Keep conversationsto the minimum . " Everything ! Her marriage . My career . Her poison ivy . My research . Heisenberg 's law . She kept wanting to break it . Variations on a Theme of Mendel 's , ' my doctoral thesis . The telephone kept us from falling apart . Then she married ... " " Was it . . . is it a good marriage ? " " On the telephone we decided that there was no such thing as a good marriage . That was just before she left Chicago to join Jimmy in Asia . I remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay the telephone company . " " Was she happy with him ? " " Well , she was a wife and he was a husband . That 's always a problem , is n't it ? "  | " Why did n't you get married ? " " I wanted children . I ca n't have any . I am . . . ill-made . So why get married ? " " Good question . " But Geraldine 's discontent was plain . " You were lucky , " she said , with unexpected envy . " You had motherhood before you went beyond it . " " I am not a good mother . " This was true . I felt guilty . I would go to F.A.O . Schwartz . Buy toys . " But I was happy enough in Boston . Then Doris . . . Lakshmi suddenly appeared . Told me who she was . Who Jimmy was . Who I was . " Did you believe her ? " Geraldine shook her head . " Of course not . At least not right away . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She was pregnant . She wanted me with her . Then when the child was born , she got typhoid . So did the child . Giles and I saved Lakshmi . The baby died . By then there was no question of my ever leaving her , again . So I was put on the payroll , and given a laboratory . M.I.T. sent me an ultimatum . Either I come back , or lose tenure . I stayed in Katmandu . " A cold wind rattled the branches overhead . Geraldine shivered . " We have a marvelous destiny , Teddy . I ca n't tell you more than that . Because ... There are , " she said , suddenly very hard , " rats in that iv-y . " I looked at the ground cover in back of the statue . Two rats were standing on their hind legs , eyes bright , confident , unblinking . They stared at us until we left the park , in a hurry . Our guards were delighted . Black prostitutes ( ostensibly female ) in silver wigs and short @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Adult Bookshops " alternated with massage parlors and , worst of all , with Greek restaurantswhere the smell of frying grease deserved a circle to itself in Dante 's hell . Sleazy movie houses advertised porno and murder films , subjects hardly alien to the street people . " They are all so . . . unlovable . " Geraldine 's reaction was much like mine . But she had picked a word I 'd not have used . " They 'll be happy when the age of Kali ends . " " How do you know ? " I took a perverse line . " Perhaps they are having a good time . " " I doubt it . "  |p133At  the corner of Eighth Avenue was another Kalki billboard , advertisingthe Madison Square Garden rally . Six-foot-high letters proclaimedKALKI . Under a drawing of Kalki on the white horse were the names of the artists who would be appearing with him on March 15 . The mixture of show biz and religion was shrewd if disquieting . I thought of the Maharaj-ji in the Houston Astrodome . Of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aim . But to what end ? The End ? Geraldine stared fixedly at the sign . " Are you praying ? " Geraldine shook her head ; and laughed . " No . Well , yes . In a way . I was praying that Kalki does n't fall off that horse and break his neck . He 's terrified of horses . " We walked briskly down Eighth Avenue . The pale sun had entirely given up , and the sky was the color of mud . The chill was getting to me . In front of a place that featured go-go dancers ( male ) , I asked , " What will happen to us on April 3 ? Are we going to burn up , too ? " " We will go on . " This came out very fast . " As ourselves ? " " Changed , I think . I do n't know . I have no recollection of being present at the end of a cycle before . Have you ? " " Of course I do n't . " The game was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything except being alive this time around . " I stepped aside to let a drug addict stumble past us ; his eyes were shut ; he was asleep , and walking . " I do n't believe we go on . " " We do . " If Geraldine was acting , she was more than usually convincing . I had decided that she was in love with Lakshmi . As a result , she was willing to suspend normal belief and help them play at divinity or ( was this possible ? ) she , too , trafficked in drugs . I realized how little I actually knew about my fellow Perfect Masters . I think that if I could have got out then , I would have . I was not amused by Chinese hit men on the prowl . By presidential candidates with subpoenas . By DEA agents with indictments . Unfortunately , I needed the money . I needed the Sun . I needed Kalki . I was hooked . But not happy . The mysterious Madison Square Garden ( neither square nor a garden ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Security was tight Fortunately , our guards were able to vouch for usp134with their colleagues . We were admitted , only to find that Dr. Lowell had just left . Geraldine and I entered the auditorium . A half-dozen work lights did no more than illuminate the central area where a number of men were putting the finishing touches to a forty-foot-high pyramid . At the touch of a button the pyramid would open , according to Geraldine ; she had helped design the mechanism . On top of the pyramid was the low throne where Kalki would sit . At the foot of the pyramid a small gray man with a beard was supervising the assemblage of a complicated piece of machinery . Geraldineintroduced me to Professor Ludwig Jossi . He had received a Nobel prize for having isolated the smallest ( as of that date ) manifestation of energy , the quark . He taught at Lausanne . He had been for some years a student of Vedanta . Recently , he had accepted Kalki as the last incarnation of Vishnu . Since Professor Jossi was the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deal of astonished publicity . Certainly , he made a pleasant contrast to all the rock stars who were into Kalki . To a man , these performers were absolutely wired , as they would say , by or to The End . Professor Jossi spoke English with an imperfect accent . " I think there will be no bugs . The pictures should be beautiful . " " Exactly when will the atom split ? " Geraldine was intense . At that time , any reference to the splitting of an atom tended to unnerve me . " I shall throw the switch as soon as Kalki gives the exact date for the end of the age of Kali . Then we will be able to observe the actual disintegration of the atom on a specially designed screen just above his head . The colors should be exquisite , and awe-inspiring . Dramatizing for all the world to see , the power of Vishnu to create and to destroy . " I felt ill . If these people were as mad as I was beginning to think that they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just one atom . There would be a chain reaction . Dominoes would fall . All earth would be enveloped in nuclear fire . As casually as I could , I asked if there was any danger of a chain reaction . Professor Jossi did not take the question well . " Certainly not . This is a time of testing , of warning . The people must be given a chance to purify themselves . Later , of course ... " Geraldine interrupted him , as if afraid that he might say too much.  | " Later Kalki will do what he must do . " Suddenly she pointed , to the pyramid behind us . " And here he is ! " Professor Jossi and I both turned , half-expecting to see Kalki . But Geraldine was referring to the top part of a huge Styrofoam statue of Vishnu . Attached to a pulley , the crowned head and upper torso ( with four arms ) were slowly descending in order to meet the bottom part which was already in place behind the pyramid . In silence , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dim light was ghostly , ghastly . Abruptly , I left Geraldine , and spent the rest of the day shopping for toys at F.A.O . Schwartz. 2T EIGHT THE NEXT MORNING , THE TELEPHONE RANG . I HAD A HARDtime waking up . I was on Valium again . Because of the constant security , the menace of Jason McCloud ( if real ) , of Chinese hit men ( if real ) , the end of the world ( if real ) , my nerves were stretched , as H.V.W. so often observed , taut . " Who is it ? " I no longer said hello . " Geraldine . Kalki 's here . We 're on the boat . It 's called the Narayana . We 're all waiting for you . " She gave me an address on the East River . I said that I would be right over . I put powdered coffee in a drinking glass , added hot water from the tap ; gulped the resulting mess . I am usually a " morning person , " but not that day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For another , I was aware that I had dreamed a good deal but could not remember a single dream , always a bad sign . I decided to walk to the ship , to clear my head with rich carbon monoxide . The morning was cold . The sky dark . The spring late . As I walked east along Fifty-Seventh Street , I watched the yellow-robed Kalki disciplesgo about their business . They were impressive . First , they would approach a well-dressed person of the sort who would normally run ap136mile to avoid a panhandler for god , any god . Then they would charm him or her . Pamphlets were usually accepted . Paper lotuses were always accepted . Even the prosperous were attracted by the Lotus Lotteries . In fact , the whole country rushed to buy Friday 's newspaper which told who had won what . The Narayana turned out to be something on the order of the Queen Mary , currently and sadly aground at Long Beach . Since I had never been aboard a large ship , I assumed that the pre-jet ocean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always , intense security . Armed guards stood on the shore . Armed guards stood on the deck . The immediate neighborhood was crowded with New York police , as well as ( presumably ) agents in mufti from the thousand and one government spy services . After a long conversation by walkie-talkie with someone inside the ship , I was allowed to go aboard . The gangplank swung dangerously back and forth in the wind . On the deck , more guards checked me out . Then I was shown into a vast living room or salon . Once inside , there was nothing to remind you that this was a ship . There were chandeliers , marble fireplaces , blue-green tapestries , Samarkand rugs . It was all a bit like San Simeon , William Randolph Hearst 's megalo-castle , now a museum . I sat on the edge of a tapestried chair , somewhat overwhelmed by the Narayana ( yet another of Vishnu 's names : " one who moves upon the waters " ) . Presently , I was joined by Geraldine , Professor Jossi and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one another , as if we had not spent the previous day together . " Kalki 's here ! " she whispered . " He 's on the ship ! " " I know . You told me . " I was suddenly curious . " How did he get through customs ? " I could see the alleged drug entrepreneur being frisked by Hares ; each orifice explored , while all baggage was x-rayed and sniffed at by large Alsatian dogs . Then I imagined the alleged god riding down  --  is it Wall Street ? with tons of ticker-tape and confetti falling from skyscraper windows as he stood in an open car , waving to the crowds the way Lindbergh and Amelia still do in the old newsreels . " He just sneaked in . The customs people were very cooperative . Nobody wanted any fuss . This boat , " she added , " is the third largest yacht in the world . Giles bought it last week for Kalki Enterprises . "  | " Paid for ? " I asked . This was the sort of detail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smiled . " The down payment is all that 's necessary , considering . . . " Yes , she really thought that the world had only twenty-one more days to go . Just like Christmas , I thought . I was glad that I had mailed off several interesting toys to the children . A gong sounded . Then Giles Lowell sidled into the drawing room . He bowed low to all of us , hands together in the Indian greeting . We responded . While we were pranaming , Kalki and Lakshmi made their entrance . I almost did not recognize Kalki . He wore a mod brown mohair suit . I much preferred him in saffron robes . On the other hand , Lakshmi was ravishing in a St. Laurent copy that must have cost her a fortune at Saks or wherever she had bought it ( Russian peasant-style in peacock blue , a color I 've always loved but can not wear because my coloring kills the blue which , in revenge , murders me ) . " Shanti ! " Kalki made a sign of benediction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for an instant , made weak by the smell of sandalwoodand blondness . Lakshmi did not embrace me , which was just as well : two infusions of so much blondness would have totally unstrung me , even at sea level . Then Kalki and Lakshmi sat side by side in a loveseat while the rest of us sat in a semicircle around them . Giles remained standing . " I have already made my report to the highest of the high , " he announced in a slightly Ashokian voice . " There have been numerous efforts not only to discredit us but to intimidate us . Both here and in Katmandu . Nevertheless , we shall persevere . Just as we shall prevail . Unfortunately , one-third of the tickets for the rally at Madison Square Garden are now in the hands of scalpers who are selling the most desirable seats in Rows A to F for as high as one thousand dollars apiece ! " We were all pleased to hear this . But Giles was indignant . " We 're not making the money . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ action . " I thought this slightly inconsistent . After all , if in three weeks ' time . . . Eventually , Giles finished his treasurer 's report . We all looked expectantlyat Kalki . He was amiable , mild . " I 'm glad to see all of you again . I hope you have n't been hassled too much . " Ile was relaxed to the point of ordinariness . Ile paused ; looked at his shoes . For a moment , hep138seemed to have left us . Then Lakshmi whispered something to him and he returned . The atman ( soul ) was once again atcha ( here ) . " In the next few days there will be at least one serious attempt on my life . " Kalki might have been discussing the functions of a piece of machinery . " Do not take it seriously . " Suddenly he grinned , and crossed his ankles , toes pointed like a dancer . He was most appealing . I had a frisson of mountain fever . " I know the future as I know the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touched his eyelids as impersonallyas if they were a pair of spark plugs . " I ca n't tell you what will happen in the next few days . I wish I could . I can only see possible combinations . It 's like throwing dice . Let 's just hope it wo n't be snake eyes for Jim Kelly because as long as I am located here , " he ran his hands down his chest , " I can be killed . " " Oh , no ! " This came not from Lakshmi but from Geraldine . A light bulb switched on in my head . Geraldine was in love not only with her best friend but with her best friend 's husband , too . I was jealous . But of whom ? I suppose I was jealous of all of them . Yet Lakshmi was plainly unattainable , and Kalki was out of the question despite our adventure beside the Nepalese lake . That left Geraldine . Yes , it was Geraldine . Even then . But I was in despair . I had not received @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was in love with Kalki , I had no chance at all . I saw the future as a kind of Turkish harem , with us three girls padding about , wearing bells on our toes as we waited for our lord to come and make his selection for the evening . " Do n't worry . " Kalki was soothing . " If I 'm obliged to drop Jim Kelly 's body , I will take another body and the age of Kali will end right on schedule . Those of you who believe in me , who remain constant despite temptation , will continue into the next cycle , either reborn or as you are . " This was the first time that Kalki had explicitly promised some of us personal survival after the age of Kali 's end . Now : What did I really think that cold morning aboard the Narayana ? To answer honestly ( as I have been requested ) , I must say that I do n't know . So much has happened since . I am now all hindsight and can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think ( I may be wrong but who can prove otherwise ? ) that I was beginning to accept , in a subliminal way , the idea that there would he no more human race after April 3 , except for a few of us , chosen by Kalki . At the . same timep139the conscious part of my brain absolutely ignored the unconscious part . I went right on planning for the future . I had met with an editor at Doubleday 's shortly after Kalki 's appearance on 6o Minutes . I had picked the day wisely because Kalki had been a sensation . CBS had racked up a Nielsen rating of 36.3 , the highest ever in that particular time slot . The whole country was now aware of Kalki and The End . I do recall that at first the editor was uncertain about the book 's value if the world did not end on schedule . Finally , we both agreed that no matter what did or did not happen the story had a lot of appeal . He asked me who should write the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Weiss , I would ( believe it or not ! ) take Weiss as my spectral author . I then made plans to see the children . I let Arlene make Easter reservations for us at the Princess Hotel in Acapulco where Howard Hughes began the cooling process that was to end in the air over Houston . Personally , I would like to die at the controls of a jet . Alone , of course . Of a heart attack . To sum up , I went on planning for the future . But my dreams were uneasy . Giles again took the floor to burden us with more details . " The IRS audit is now into the second month and they are , I am happy to say , as confused by our finances as I am . " Obligatory laughter . Everyone knew that Giles was never confused by anything . Kalki looked remote , atman ready for a take-off . Then Professor Jossi spoke for the first time . " Be so good , Dr. Lowell , as to explain to me why your tax authorities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which under the laws of your country is entirely exempt from any sort of taxation ? " In the age of Kali there was very little that a Swiss  --  even a nuclear physicist  --  did n't know about taxes . " We are a duly organized and officially registered religion . Ergo , we are tax-exempt . " Dr. Ashok tended to surface when Giles discussed I linduism . " But for some mysterious reason the United States Governmentis morbidly eager to prove that we are  --  like the dupes of the Reverend Sun Moon  --  financed by a certain foreign government whose aim is the overthrow of this great republic which is , deservedly , the envy of the earth . What other nation has so many hundreds of thousands of dedicated , mining secret police in every corner not only of the First , Second and Third Worlds but iii every city , town and village of our owtt beloved tJnited States ? What other nation has made itselfp140a world empire not so much through force  --  or sale  --  of arms as through the invention of the multinational @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on earth but , unofficially , is the creation of ruling class United Statesmen or persons ? What other nation . . . " Giles was off , and running ; and making no sense . When pressed , Giles liked to pretend that Kalki Enterprises was being persecuted by the American Government because of a supposed Chinese or Cuban or Soviet connection  --  the foreign power involved depended on who was currently the enemy of the United States as recorded in the press or blurted out on television by one of the President'sgarrulous employees . By the time Giles got down to cases , Kalki 's atman was plainly roaming around the universe . The blue eyes were open but they did not see . The tenant of Jim Kelly 's body was not at home . " To summarize , " Giles was relentless , " we are the victims of the American Government 's dislike of any organization that appears to be more attractive to the citizens of the country than the Federal Government , that protean organization with a thousand aspects , including the so-called Mafia which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Administration , our specific enemy . " Dr. Lowell . " Professor Jossi had not been conned . " In Europe I am often asked by the press why Kalki Enterprises is supposed to be engaged in the illicit sale of drugs . I find this question impossible to answer . Tantric rites to one side , Hinduism is opposed to the use of drugs . Am I to assume that this is simply a canard invented by the decadent Judeo-Christian government of your country in order to discreditthe one true religion ? Or is there the proverbial grain of truth in this allegation ? Do enlighten us , Dr. Lowell . " I looked to see if Kalki had been listening . But there was no one behind the face . The atman ( Vishnu himself ) was no doubt coasting somewhere in the general area of star Arcturus , molding future stars from swirling dust while the quasars sang their songs and black holes opened onto other eternities . I was curious to hear what Giles would say . I looked at Geraldine . She seemed uneasy . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I was certain that , whatever it was , Giles would not reveal it . Withp141a straight face , he said , " We are not in the drug business , Professor Jossi . It is contrary to the teachings of our lord ... " " But , Dr. Lowell , " Professor Jossi was a hard-minded man . " Accordingto yesterday 's Neue Archer Zeitung you are the proprietor of something known as the New Orleans Tropical Bird and Fish Company , which is about to be investigated by a Senate committee on the ground that the company is ... " ... engaged in the sale of narcotics . " Giles broke in smoothly . " Well , the shop belongs to me . Years ago Kalki was a partner , but I bought him out . You must believe me , my dear Professor Jossi , when I assure you that we deal only in tropical birds and fish . At one time , a very short time and on a small scale , I confess that we bought and sold  --  illegally , I fear  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that beautiful moment when I entered Perfect Masterhood , I have given orders to our agents in the field to accept no more shrunken heads of people though I have not yet drawn the line at the purchase and resale of shrunken monkey heads . " I thought this splendid double-talk . Professor Jossi did not seem convinced but there was nothing he could do about it . He kept looking at Kalki , hoping to be set straight . But Kalki was in farthest space . Giles shook off the question ( he literally wriggled ) , as he said , " Frankly , in the light of what is due to happen twenty-one days from now , Senate investigations fade to insignificance . Meanwhile , our strategymust be one of delay . At this moment we are threatened by the United States Government in two of its many aspects . First , by the IRS . Second , by the DEA . And ... " I made some mischief . " And third by the Triad . A Chinese hit society in the pay of the Chao Chow Society @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rumors were true . Lakshmi turned pale . No , that is what H.V.W. would have written automatically , as I just did . Actually she stayed the same color but her mouth dropped open . She turned to Kalki , as though for help . Got none . Turned to Geraldine , who looked angry . I had given a good part of the game away . But the others had no idea what I was talking about . Professor Jossi looked bewildered ; and Giles sailed past my interruption with a diversionary hit of information . " I should also mention that the local Roman Catholichierarchy has gone into an unholy alliance with the Jewish Defensep142League . Working together , they will try to disrupt the rally on March 15 . As a result , contrary to press reports , in the interest of security , Kalki will not appear with a number of Christian and Jewish leaders next Sunday on the David Susskind Show . " There was some discussion of Professor Jossi 's nuclear effect . He reported that there would be no technical difficulties . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question , as I relive those extraordinary days . For one thing , I had decided that if Kalki was mad enough to kill off the human race , he would do so with some sort of nuclear chain reaction . From the first moment that I met Professor Jossi , I had a sense of doom . " Space and time are the domain of the poet . Let him go where he will and do what he pleases : this is the Law . " Substitute Kalki for " poet , " and Victor Hugo 's line would be Kalki 's apotheosis . Contemplating Law and poet in the salon of the Narayana , I wondered if I could ever comprehend the notion of all human life ( except for a few of us ? ) ending . I gave it up . My mind could not contain the idea . Instead , I lapsed to my usual state ; regarded Kalki as a charmer , a crook , a con man , the very essence of sandalwood , blondness . Suddenly , Kalki was at home again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the meeting was over . Asked me if I knew how to ride . When I said , yes , he invited me to ride with him in Central Park . I could borrow a pair of his blue jeans . He also changed to blue jeans ; and a yachting cap . Accompanied by four security guards , we drove to the stables where the white horse from India was in residence . I rented a broken-down hunter . The security guards were assigned guaranteed-to-be-safe ponies . Two guards rode in front of us ; two behind . They looked glum . The day was sharp . Blue fragments accented the sky 's usual hazel . My face burned from a cold breeze that smelled of snow . Mid-march was winter . Dust particles in the air were sending the sun 's rays back into space . We were scheduled to freeze . Central Park was brown but pleasant . I found myself thinking of the hills above Burbank where I used to ride with Earl Jr . before marriage put an end to such companionable outings . That was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . My horse shied at every hush ; was flatulent . Kalki 's white horse was uncommonly beautiful . Unfortunately , Kalki was a nervous rider ; he had a heavy rein ; did not under/stand the rhythm of a horse in its paces . Luckily , the horse was goodnatured . I did what I could to help them . Kalki gave no hint of our previous intimacy . " I do n't know New York at all , " he said . " I came here once . In my senior year at Tulane . But I was too broke to go anywhere except the Radio City Music Hall . Remember the Rockettes ? " " Yes . In fact , I know one . She 's retired . She 's a friend of Arlene Wagstaff . " " I like your friend Arlene . " I could not tell what , if anything , Kalki meant . Did he know ? " I remember her from the movies . " Kalki pulled his cap over his eyes as a group of schoolgirls rode past us in single file @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyed them suspiciously . So did I. Fortunately , there was not a Chinese in the lot . Our horses shied as a pair of black criminals chased what looked to be two Hispanic criminals across the bridle path . A knife glinted . Or gleamed . Or shone . As we reined in our horses , the security guards just back of us drew their revolvers . But the criminals had vanished behind a hill . We paused a moment . There was a scream . Then nothing . We rode on . " They will not be missed . " Again , that disconcerting flatness in Kalki 's voice ; a coldness to match the day . " But will there be any one left to miss them ? Or am I breaking the rules ? " Kalki only smiled . Then he went into a canter . I followed . The security guards did their best to keep up with us . We must have gone a half-mile before Kalki reined in the white horse . Just above the tower of a hotel named the Essex House , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a silver needle . " I do n't think my seat is too bad , do you ? " I said nothing . At least he had not fallen off . " We 've bought a new Garuda . A Boeing 707 . Are you checked out in the 707 ? " " Yes . But you 'll need a trained copilot , a navigator , a ... " " I can learn all that . " " When ? " " When I can . Do you like Geraldine ? " For the first time Kalki had asked inc a personal question . I Ic even seemed interested in my answer . " Yes . Very much . We have a lot in common . "  | " I 'm glad . She 's valuable , too . " A funny word , I thought . As if she  --  and I  --  were his personal possessions . I took advantage of Kalki 's off-duty mood . " But I ca n't say that I find Giles entirely . . . straightforward . " " He has the hardest role @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He must oppose . He must be the other . Study the Vedas . " I had been doing my best to get through some of the many thousands of poems , hymns , mantras , anecdotes from prehistory that make up the Hindu holy books . At the ashrams the gurus gave the initiates a crash course in the beginning and the end ; unfortunately , they left out the all-important middle . " I suppose it is the duplicity , " I said . " I really thought he was Dr. Ashok . " " You were meant to . Everyone is meant to . If Giles sets foot in Nepal as Giles , he goes to jail . " " Because he is trafficking in drugs ? " " Yes . " Why do we darknesses think that those who are light are necessarily transparent . . . like light itself ? From the logbook , a line of Racine : Cetait pendant l'horreur d'une profonde nuit . I could never make a translation as terrifying as the sound of the original . It was during ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looming ... no , threatening ) the horror of a dark night . But profonde is not just the dark . Profonde can also mean the depths of the abyss itself , the universal darkness that buries all . In this context , Kalki 's " yes " was somehow more reverberant and chilling than any of his incantations about the end or The End . Dark night was descending now , on two riders in Central Park . " You , too ? " " Yes . " Kalki kept his eyes on the towers of the city . No more denials . " Why ? " " Money . For the ashrams . The mandali . The books , pamphlets . Where else could we get so much so quickly ? " " I 'm shocked , " I giggled . Something I never do . I was shocked . I was frightened , too . " Why ? We 're not exactly secret . Where else could the money come from ? " " Disciples . Contributions . The 1 , otus I , otteries . No , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lotuses . I do n't know . I mean , I 'm not really shocked by this . " I was gabbling . " Well , no , I am shocked , I suppose , I mean that Kalki , the avatar of Vishnu and all the rest is phony . That your religious mission is just a front for something so squalid ... " " I am Kalki . I am the avatar of Vishnu . I have come to purify . I have come to make an ending . But I am also in the body of Jim Kelly . And he had a history before me . He sold drugs in Saigon . He worked for the Chao Chow of Hong Kong . He had a partnership with his old professor back in New Orleans . When I became manifest , I used what was at hand . I get money as Jim Kelly would get it , by trafficking in drugs . Meanwhile , I have done what I came to do . I have taught . I have warned . I have tried to reach as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " You have no moral feeling about drug addiction ? I mean , aside from being illegal , it can lead to death , too . " " I am death . . . too . " : As if to make the point , the last remnant of blue sky was obscured by brown clouds . Large flakes of snow fell between us . I was frozen , in every sense . Kalki turned toward me . The beautiful eyes were as generative of light as ever . " Do n't be afraid , " he said . " There will be no pain . " " How ? What will happen ? " " I shall dream something else . That 's all . " " We are your dreams ? " Kalki nodded . He looked happy , as if a student had finally resolved some difficult equation . " I am the mind that contains all things as well as no thing or nothing . I am , and that is all . " " If you 're dreaming this , then why did you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this world . Why allow the age of Kali to exist ? " " I play a game . I must abide by the rules that I make for they make me , too . I can not tell you more because human speech is insufficient . J ust remember , in eternity only my dreams decorate the emptiness . " " You are alone out there , in eternity ? " " In here , out there , these are just phrases . I am . There is nothing else . " I had an inspiration  --  racial memory ? or simply something that I had heard recently and not understood . " Who , " I asked , " is Siva ? " Kalki answered me in a voice different from his own , a voice that wasp146deep , harsh , sibilant . " There is no difference between Siva who exists in the form of Vishnu and Vishnu who exists in the form of Siva . " " You are the same but not the same ? " For a moment , we rode in silence . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , once again , not at home . Then he began to chant , " I am the lord of songs , the lord of sacrifices . I am breath . I am spirit . I am the supreme lord . I alone was before all things , and I exist and I shall be . No other transcendsme . I am eternal and not eternal , discernible and undiscernible . I am Brahma and I am not Brahma . I am without beginning , middle or end . Know me , and you will not die . There is no other way . " The chanting stopped . Kalki turned toward me , the eyes were a blind blue glare . " At the time of the end , I annihilate all worlds . I am Siva the destroyer . " We were riding past something called the Tavern on the Green . I reined in my horse . Alarmed ? Yes . Ready for flight ? I do n't know . But Kalki was now himself again , or at least he was the self that I was most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Oh , yes . An alarming god , is n't he ? " " He is my frown , Teddy . Let 's hope I never need to frown . As Vishnu , I only smile . As Vishnu , I am the preserver . " " You do n't sound as if you 're about to do much preserving on April 3 . " " I shall preserve what is best . " Although I did not believe that Kalki was Vishnu , I was now certain that he believed it . And so , for all practical purposes , god was again among us . To the extent that this particular god embodied ancient dreams of death and rebirth , he might yet prevail . But in what way ? Nuclear chain reaction . I could think of nothing else . I wondered whether or not to alert the police , the Sun , Senator White . But I did nothing . I did not even tell Morgan about Kalki 's confession . He wouldfind out anyway . DRUG MESSIAH BUSTED . That would be the Sun'sheadline . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But how , I wondered , would they cover world 's end ?  |p1470N  THE MORNING OF MARCH 15 THERE WAS A SNOWSTORM . I LAYin bed , and watched snowflakes strike against the window . On contact with the heated glass , the snow turned to water . Arlene rang me . She was an all-out Kalki fan . " I was up at dawn towatch that five-minute special on Good Morning , America , I mean , greater love hath no Arlene . Angel , he 's out of sight ! The End ! " Arlene indulged in the national joke , saying The End with a rising inflection . Overnight every comedian in the country had his own way of saying The End . It was a sure-fire laugh-getter . One television comedian always pretended to shoot up whenever Kalki was mentioned . The whole subject was good for a laugh . Yet even early on much of the laughter was uneasy . After all , a great many people had visited the ashrams . Read the pamphlets . Seen Kalki on television . Whether or not they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who or what Kalki was , something very odd was happening . Unfortunately , there was almost no serious analysis of the Kalki phenomenon in the press . As of March 15 , the hot subject was whether or not the President would replace the Vice-President . The putative end of human life was a non-subject . " Now , " said Arlene . " Give with some inside info . What 's he going to do ? What 's he cooked up ? " " I do n't know , " I was vague . " Just a sermon , I guess . " My blood still turned to ice at the thought of what he had told me in Central Park . A few comments like that on national television and there would be total panic . " You 're an old meanie . You know and you wo n't tell me . Well , you tell him that I think he 's a pussycat , and really groovy . " Arlene was addicted to the slang of her youth " A solid sender ! " she added , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the troops , and I was born . " He told me that he liked you , too . " Arlene was thrilled . " We have the same body waves , you know . I 've read his chart . We complement each other . So you tell him that I 'm giving a Kalki party tonight and that we 're all going to sit around and watch him on the tube because he 's about the biggest thing that 's hit the Hollywood Hills since what's-his-name walked on the moon . " Arlene was not far off . Not only the whole United States but that fortunate part of the world which had access to Telstar tuned in to watch Kalki proclaim ( live from Madison Square Garden ) the end of the age of Kali . Madison Square Garden itself had been in a state of siege all day . Every entrance was guarded by mounted police while the streets leadingto the Garden were jammed . In Eighth Avenue alone there were an estimated fifty thousand people , waiting for a glimpse of Kalki . It took me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Garden , to get to Giles 's command post overlooking Eighth Avenue . On arrival , I was told by a harassed secretary ( eight telephones never stopped ringing ) that Kalki had not yet arrived but that Giles was giving a briefing in the pressroom . As I looked down at the crowd in the avenue , I remembered somethingmy father had told me about Amelia Earhart . He had taken her to a football game at USC . Amelia was not a fan . My father was . At the most exciting moment in the game , when someone had made a touchdown and everyone was on his feet , yelling , cheering , booing , Amelia asked , " What color is a crowd ? " The pressroom at the Garden was just back of the pyramid on which Kalki would sit . Between pressroom and pyramid stood the colossal blue Styrofoam statue of Vishnu , four arms outstretched , face scowling beneath a tall crown . Giles was seated on a desk . At least a hundred journalists were crowded into the room . Overhead fluorescent lights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once . Finally , one journalist was heard : " Is it true that Mr. Kelly , who calls himself Kalki , has never actually changed his name legally to Kalki . Do you care to comment on that ? " This was par for the course . Giles was in his clement . But then liep149was a natural ( which is to say spontaneous ) liar . He answered at irrelevantlength . " Have you any comment , " announced a tall black lady from The Village Voice , " on Senator Johnson White 's committee and its alleged intention to investigate Kalki Enterprises and their alleged connection with the trafficking of drugs in Asia and elsewhere around the world ? " Suddenly that crowded smoky room was so quiet that I could hear the humming of the air conditioning . Giles was superb . " Like all good Americans , we at Kalki Enterprises are indebted to Johnson White , and to his committee 's hard-hitting investigations . If ever there was a great American it is Johnson White and , for what it is worth , we at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect intended . Everyone was confused . " Senator White says that next week he 's going to call Mr. Kalki , as a witness . " The black lady persisted . " Will Mr. Kalki be supportive ? " " Hopefully , Kalki is supportive of all of us all of the time and for all time . " Giles was launched on what sounded to be a major aria . Unfortunately , the other journalists were now coming to life . " Has he been subpoenaed ? " Asked one . No . " What is the capitalization of Kalki Enterprises ? " Asked another . " You must ask the Internal Revenue Service . For some weeks their top accountants have been examining our books . Off the record , " Giles was back in stride , " they are not going to finish their work before the end of the world . " Giles laughed loudly , and alone . The press did not know how to react . Bruce Sapersteen was suddenly at my side . " Hi , Teddy , " he sniffed . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end ? " Giles 's response was coy . " This evening Kalki will speak to the city , to the world , and to the cosmos beyond . He has told me that he will give us the date then . " Bruce and I left the pressroom . The houselights in the auditorium were on . Ushers were roaming the aisles , preparing for the arrival of the audience . The television crews were in their places just opposite the pyramid . Guards were everywhere . In front of the pyramid a stage had been set up for the rock stars . Technicians were adjusting microphones . " I'he towering statue of Vishnu was as alarming as ever . Bruce asked mep150to explain the statue to him . He seemed less stoned than usual . " Well , one hand is holding a club and another hand is holding the sacred lotus ... " " While the other two are picking the pockets of the faithful . You know , Teddy , I think you 're a closet convert . So does Morgan . " " You 're both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practitioner . " " Are you making it with Kalki ? " Bruce had modeled himself on one of the two young journalists who had investigated Watergate , not the Robert Redford one in the film , alas ; the other one . I found Bruce 's impersonation highly resistible , and told him so , using short brutal Anglo-Saxon words . " Well , I was just curious . I mean , you do n't have to bite my head off . Here . Let me buy you some coffee . " A vendor sold him two containers of coffee . Then we sat side by side in the front row , looking up at stage , pyramid , statue . " Those arms move ? " Bruce was plainly freaked out by the statue . " I hope not . " " Did you know that the de Laurentiis King Kong was mostly a guy in an ape suit ? They never did get a monster that really worked . " Bruce was always full of information , most of it depressing . " I have n't seen a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did love Elvira Madigan . But then I am romantic . " There 's a rumor that your boy is going to be arrested tonight . " Bruce sniffed , a happy sound . " He 's not my boy . Who 's going to arrest him ? And why ? " " The narcs . " " McCloud 's an idiot . " My educated guess graduated with honors . " McCloud 's a pretty savvy guy . " Bruce often talked like a running character in a minor TV crime series . " So who 's he working for ? He 's a double , maybe triple agent . " I could talk television , too . But then what American could not at the end of the age of Kali ? Each day the average American watched seven not necessarily consecutive hours of television . Periodically , there would be a widely published report to the effect that thanks to all this TVviewing , Americans now knew more about wildlife , detergents , foreign countries , and electrical appliances than ever before . " McCloud 's working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also working for Kalki . " I wanted to see how Bruce would react to that one . But Bruce was one up on me . " I know . He 's also in with the Chao Chow . And with the Triad . " For the first time in our acquaintance Bruce had managed to interest me . I wanted to ask him more . But the audience had started to arrive and , in the confusion , we were separated . Just back of Vishnu 's head was the Green Room . Here a number of the mandali were gathered . A window of one-way glass looked out onto the auditorium . We could see the audience but they could not see us . On the wall opposite the window a row of TV monitors showed us , variously , the interior of the Garden , the street outside , a rerun of I Love Lucy , a panel program . . . everything that was being shown on network television as well as whatever the cameras inside and outside the Garden were picking up . Geraldine wore a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not . But her greeting was affectionate . Professor Jossi looked pleased with himself . Apparently , the atom would split in an orderly way . " Kalki 's arriving by helicopter . " Geraldine was as excited as a child at the circus . I fell , once again , in love . " He 'll land on the roof . " Giles came to us straight from the press conference . He was more than usually manic . He waved a telegram at us . " The President hopes that the course of world peace and understanding will be advanced by what happens here tonight ! " Everyone applauded . " Now , " said Lakshmi , " he will be thrice-born . " Giles went off into a corner where he communed with a walkietalkie . The rest of us looked at the television monitors . Everyone preferred to watch the doings in the auditorium on television rather than directly through the window . This was a commonplace in that era : events were only real if experienced at second hand , preferably through the medium of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I do n't think people would like that . " Geraldine was unexpectedly mild . " After all , you do n't arrest god . " They arrested Jesus Christ . " " Do n't worry , Teddy . This is the homestretch ! " Professor Jossi had much the same message . Ile  --  addressed the twop152of us as if we were in one of his classes , not the advanced one . " There will be a clear and unusual picture of the atom or , to be exact , the atom 's shadow or mandala or effect , as it explodes , producing some quite vivid and unusual colors within the tiny spectrum that the human eye can comprehend as opposed to all those radiant colors which our eyes may not see until we have attained Vaikuntha . " " I hope , Professor Jossi , " I spelled it out , " that there is no risk of a chain reaction . " " There will be , " said Professor Jossi , spelling it out , too , " no errors of any kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Because , " I said , " if there should be a nuclear chain reaction the earth will not be habitable for centuries . " " You confuse two things . " Professor Jossi raised his right hand . Thumb and forefinger came together , as if he were holding chalk . " One , you seem to think that I might make an error . Let me put at ease your mind . There will be no error . All around the earth , thanks to television , the audience will see a unique atomic display , symbolizing the power of Vishnu , the sole originator of that primal explosion which launched the knowable universe . On the other hand , your analysis of what would result if an atomic chain reaction were to be set off is not accurate . Depending on the sort of fissionable material used , the reactionmight kill certain living things whilst sparing others ... " Professor Jossi was interrupted by the sound of Kalki 's helicopter which came , needless to say , not from overhead ( the room was soundproofed ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , hovering over Eighth Avenue . Then there were shots of the roof of Madison Square Garden where television units were waiting to record Kalki 's arrival . Most of the press corps was also on hand . There was a shot of the crowds in Eighth Avenue , looking up at the helicopter from which , suddenly , thousands of paper lotus flowers were released , to the crowd 's delight . Like a swarm of white butterflies , the lotuses circled slowly in the icy evening air . We watched the landing of the helicopter . The helicopter door opened . Kalki stepped into the television lights . So harsh was the glare that the saffron robe looked white . In one hand , Kalki held a lotus . Asp153Giles hurried forward to greet him ( and get into the picture ) , an announcer 's voice kindly told us what we could see for ourselves . " Kalki has left the helicopter . He is crossing the roof of Madison Square Garden . He is being mobbed by his fans . There 's also a mob scene outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were chanting , " Kal-ki , Kal-ki ! " The announcer told us that the people were chanting " Kal-ki . " I turned from the network monitor to an interior monitor which showed the backstage of the Garden . The corridors were jammed with security men and police ; deafening was what H.V.W. would call the din from the rock stars ' dressing rooms where electric guitars whined , drums rattled , sitars plunked ; and marijuana made the air a tender blue . Over the ear-splitting noise , someone could be heard screaming " Shanti ! " Even the camera that moved shakily through the backstage area seemed stoned . Geraldine and I looked at all the monitors . Public television was doing the entire program from beginning to end . The networks were doing bits and pieces , and the usual reruns . We settled in front of a monitor which displayed a solemn analyst who wondered how Kalki had been able to fill the Garden with people who had paid as high as three thousand dollars for a single ticket on the black market . Apparently , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beatles , the spiritual high noon of the twentieth century . The Solemnity then did his best to appear serious . Gravely , he told us that " The phenomenon which is known as Kalki is not something new in American history . " ( I paraphrase from a faulty memory . ) " In the nineteenth century there were a number of end-of-the-world Christianmovements . Today , of course , we have our Seventh-Day Adventistsand Jehovah 's Witnesses . But , to date , not even the North HollywoodFirst Assembly of God has had quite the attraction for the public that this young man from New Orleans has had . By calling himself Kalki and claiming that he is Vishnu born for the last time , the young man from New Orleans has obviously touched a nerve . Certainly he has successfully exploited that fascination with Eastern mysticism in recent years which led , not so long ago , to the election as governor of Californiaof a Zen Buddhist who slept on the floor . "  |p154I  looked through the window of the auditorium . Thousands and thousands of people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the color of a crowd . I wanted to go down into the auditorium , but for some reason Geraldine was fascinated by the talking head on the monitor . So we listened to : " But there is something deeper at work here than just a fad like sleeping on the floor . Something deeper and , perhaps , alarming . Although Kalki has announced that the end of the world is at hand , something that does not , at the moment , seem very likely . " We were favored with a little smile to show that the Solemnity was not only a kindly and tolerant person but also a practical one , and not about to be conned . " Nevertheless , it is significant that so many people have responded to Kalki 's message of non-hope . " " You will be reborn , " said Geraldine to the TV set . " Is that a good thing ? " I asked . Geraldine did not answer . The Solemnity did . " Where then have we failed as parents , teachers , opinion-makers ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modest smile hung from acid-green lips . " How have we failed those young people who today follow Kalki ? Young people who accept the obliteration of this world , of this great nation even , as somethingmatter-of-fact , and not to be mourned ? There are no easy answers ... " " Only easy questions . " Geraldine finally turned away from the monitor . We entered the auditorium from the pressroom which was just back of Vishnu 's left leg . As usual , our security men ( likable , rather talkative men ) got us past their colleagues . We stepped into the blazing lights that flooded the pyramid from every side . A rock band deafened us . Holding hands , we tried to find a place from which to observe Kalki 's entrance . Just beneath the banks of television cameras , there was an empty square yard of space . We settled it . Gradually our eyes grew accustomed to the lights . We could now see the blue head of Vishnu , hovering over all like a face in a dream . Then the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , once again , the beating of my own heart . Kalki appeared atop the pyramid . He seemed made of yellow fire . The whole auditorium rocked with : " Kal-ki ! " as in unison everyone chanted those two magical syllables.  |p155Geraldine  clutched my arm and said something , which I could not hear . For a moment Kalki stood , not moving . Then he made the pranam sign and sat cross-legged on the throne . Suddenly there was not silence but stillness all around us . When Kalki 's voice came , it was soft , serene , seductive  --  and marvelouslyamplified . " I am the highest of the high . " As that first sentence hummed upon the air , Vishnu 's face was lit in such a way that for an awful instant , the statue appeared to smile . The audience gasped ; so did I. " When there was nothing , I took three steps . In space . In air . In earth . In space , I am the sun . In air , the lightning . In earth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the end . I am Kalki , the ultimate avatar of Vishnu . " I have yet to see the cassette of Kalki 's Madison Square Garden performance ( we do n't seem to have one here at the White House ) but I doubt if there was ever anything like it in the history of entertainment . Obviously I can not speak with any authority about the history of religion . But I will say that Kalki achieved his effects without tricks , magical or otherwise . He relied on nothing but that not quite New Orleans voice with which he spun his curious web around the world . As Kalki described the creation of the universe , according to the Hindu cosmogony , he used enough terms from contemporary science to sound if not entirely plausible , familiar . In describing the cycles of creation , he explained how nothing ever ends . How the dust that caught fire to make the sun was the same dust that makes up each human being . How all things are interchangeable . How nothing is ever lost or can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrangementand how at death our matter is reassembled as something else . Meanwhile , the soul continues in new incarnations until the ultimate sleep or apotheosis , until nirvana or Vaikuntha . Kalki then described how the world is divided into ages . How each age is introduced and ended by a time of twilight . How we were now at the end of the final twilight of the last of the four ages of man , the age of iron or Kali . How with each age since the original Golden Age , all things human have lost energy . How the god Vishnu came to us nine times since the first creation . I low Vishnu tried to teach men the way too enlightenment , but his way was never taken by more than a few.  |p156Now  Vishnu was among us for the tenth and last time . " Since the beginning , I have taught . Since the beginning , only a few have listened . Throughout eternity man and god have been in necessaryconflict , as are all the other elements of creation , as are all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Thus Kalki preparedthe audience for Professor Jossi 's special effects . With some effort , I forced myself not to look at the small golden figure on the throne . I wanted to see how the people in the audience were reacting . They were transfixed , mesmerized . When I say that Kalki achieved his effects entirely with his voice , I exaggerate . The audience had been conditioned in advance by the rock bands , by psychedelic lighting , by the scent of incense burning in braziers at each corner of the pyramid . Enchanted as I was by Kalki 's performance , my mind was nervously preoccupied with Professor Jossi 's fireworks . I looked about , trying to find him . I did not see Jossi . But I did see Jason McCloud just as he stepped from behind Vishnu 's statue . McCloud was clutching what looked to be the same attache case that I had seen him with in New Orleans . He appeared nervous . I remember wondering whether or not he had come to arrest Kalki . I was about to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sitting to a standing position . " I am Vishnu ! " Kalki 's voice rang through the auditorium . " I end but can not end . I die but forever live . Have faith , and you will be reborn ! " Then Kalki began to chant something perfectly incomprehensible to me but not to Geraldine and to the other mandali . He was reciting the Sanskrit hymn in celebration of the end . Yes , The End . " My God ! " Geraldine gave a cry . As Kalki chanted , he pointed to the sky or , more specifically , to Jossi 's screen which was now pulsing with light . Everyone looked up at the screen . Except Kalki . He had vanished into the pyramid . Most people were not aware that he was gone until the pyramid began , slowly , to open , revealing Kalki astride the white horse . There was no one in that audience who did not know that when Kalki mounted the white horse the world was supposed to end . Waves of emotion  --  not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There was . . . expectation ? 1 lard to say . Things happenedp157too quickly . Geraldine dropped to her knees . Covered her face with her hands . I did the same . Kalki rode toward us , brandishing a jeweled sword . The voice was strident and unfamiliar . " Those who are with me even to the end and beyond will be with me in Vaikuntha ! " Then all creation exploded . Waves of sound engulfed and deafened me . Yet I had one fraction of a second in which to congratulate myself on having guessed correctly the way that the world would end . At Kalki 's order , Jossi had set off an atomic chain reaction . Earth was now aflame , and dead . I took a bitter joy in having been right . But once the initial blast had spent itself in waves of sound , the world was still intact . So was I. So was Geraldine . So was the statue of Vishnu . So was the screen on which could be seen particles of the broken atom , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ except the rider and the white horse . They had been disintegrated . Blood was everywhere . I was the first to scream  |p158THE  MURDER ON TELEVISION WAS THE MOST DRAMATIC EVENT IN THEhistory of that medium . The Kennedy brothers and Martin Luther King had been killed off camera . Although Oswald had been satisfactorilymurdered on camera , he was not at the time a star , or even a featured player . On the other hand , Kalki was already god to millions of people . To those other millions who rejected him as god , he was undeniably that most eminent of all creatures in the last days of the age of Kali , a superstar . I have surprisingly few memories of those traumatic days just after the murder in Madison Square Garden . For some reason , I vividly recall the debate in Congress as to whether or not the country 's flags should be flown at half-mast . Finally , each community was given its own option . The Mayor of New York refused to allow the flag at City Hall to be flown at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Roman Catholic and Jewish voters . Two daring Kalki-ites promptly shinnied up the flagpole and lowered the flag . A photograph of this event appeared on the front page of the New York Daily News . Yet one word is worth a thousand pictures . Particularly if it is " no. "  |p159What  else ? The explosion that disintegrated horse and rider was immediately blamed on Professor Jossi and his atom-smasher . Jossi met with the press . He filled an entire blackboard with diagrams , proving that his machine could not have done the slightest harm to anyone . This explanation was accepted because Jossi 's demonstration in applied physics was not understood . I confess ( now ) that at first I , too , blamed him . But we were all of us wrong . Sulkily , Professor Jossi withdrew to Lausanne . Final words : " This man Kelly was not the true avatar of Vishnu . I was gulled . " Because of Jossi 's accent , the press thought he said , " I was guilty . " There was more confusion when that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all became convinced that Jason McCloud was the murderer . Fairly soon , I should think . Giles assured us that McCloud had been acting on orders not from the Drug Enforcement Administration but from the Chao Chow Society , his principal employer . McCloud was a triple agent . As a bona fide agent for the DEA he had infiltrated Kalki Enterprises and Giles had been obliged to pay him a " consultancy fee . " McCloud had also infiltrated the Chao Chow Society of Hong Kong . When McCloud learned that they had taken out a contract on Kalki 's life with the Triad , he convincedthem to let him do the job . They were delighted . Who would dare accuse an American narc of such a highly visible murder ? To this day , no one knows just how McCloud set off his bomb , but we know that he did . At no point was McCloud suspected by the newspapers where rife was speculation . How did I take these events ? I was stunned . Kept out of sight for twenty-four hours . Watched television @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hour , there was a gruesome rerun , in slow motion , of rider and horse coming apart in vivid color . I could not stop watching this horror . I drank heavily . Took no calls except from Arlene , who was as distraught as I , and drunker . Two days after the murder , Giles gave a press conference aboard the Narayana . Geraldine was on hand . Lakshmi was under sedation in mother part of the ship . I wore a black dress . I had had my hair done that morning . Did not mind too much the photographers . I did mind Bruce , who squeezed beside Inc on a sofa while the cameras were being set up , lights adjusted . " He did it . " Bruce pointed a grubby finger at ( tiles.  | " To get control of the Mob . It 's his now . " " No . " I will confess to this record that I had had a suspicion or two that Giles might have wanted Kalki out of the way . Suspicions that were soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motive . After all , he and Kalki had been equal partners in the drug syndicate . They needed one another . Giles had nothing to gain by Kalki 's death ; and a good deal to lose . In the hot glare of the television lights , Giles looked remarkably unhealthy , even for him . I also noticed that Geraldine 's eyes were red . Yes , she had been in love with Kalki , I decided . Had I ? In a way . And what else is there when it comes to love but a way to be in or out of it ? including no way . " You seem awfully certain . " Bruce gave me his shrewd **28;5537;TOOLONG . I gave him my bland journalist-of-record gaze . " Yes , " I said . " I am . " " Then who did it ? " " Another religion . The U.S. Government . Does it matter ? " I was offhand . " Does it matter ? " Bruce looked as if a door had opened in my forehead and a little bird @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Warren Commission spent a lot of time on who killed J.F.K. , it 's nothing compared to what Congress will do with this murder . White 's already hit town with half his committee . You do n't have a Quaalude , do you ? " Bruce was looking a bit wired . Quaalude was a depressant , popular in show-biz circles at the end of the age of Kali . " No , " I said , happy to be able to refuse him succor . " You 'll just have to shake a bit . " Giles stood up on a chair . " I have , " he announced in a strained voice , " a statement to make . " The salon was quiet , except for the hum of the cameras . Giles began to read from a piece of paper . " Kalki lives . " Giles paused . Definitely ? Yes , I suppose so . The immediate reaction was amazement . Then there were a number of snickers . Media personages were not precisely amiable . Giles 's annoyance was plain . Anger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he repeated . " Vishnu lives . All that died in Madison Square Garden was one of the four billion human bodies currently crowding the planet . As predicted , Kalki was obliged to discard one of thosep161bodies . Presently , Kalki will inhabit a new body . He will return to us and , as predicted , he will end the age of Kali on April 3 . " The boldness of these statements produced , first , a deep silence . Then someone gave a nervous laugh . Bruce bit his knuckles . Withdrawalsymptoms ? Giles stared straight into the recording camera ; he seemed at ease now , relaxed . The television camera often has that effect . Finally , a journalist asked the obvious if slightly deranged under the circumstances question . " Where is he now , Dr. Lowell ? " " Kalki is Vishnu . Vishnu is the universe . Therefore Kalki is everywhereand nowhere . " I groaned to myself . This rigmarole always depressedme . Others , too . " I meant , Dr. Lowell , " said the inquiring reporter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to reinhabit some other body between now and April 3 ? " " I 've just told you . " There was a definite snap in Giles 's voice . " The spirit is everywhere . " " In that case , " a lady asked , " could you tell us , then , where the body is that he is going to occupy ? And who does it belong to now ? " This struck me as a good question . " I do n't know . " Giles was curt . " Then could you maybe explain to us what will happen to the present tenant of the body when Kalki takes over ? " The questioner was a syndicated columnist , known for his unready wit . Everyone laughed , except Geraldine who looked furious , red hair bristling . Red hair always bristles in Weiss-land . " Since Vishnu is already present in that body , as he is present in me and in you and in all things , there should be no dislocation . " When Giles became unusually precise , it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why did Kalki leave the old body ? " " Because , dear lady , " Giles was now pouring out his special organic honey with unstudied ease , " a person or persons unknown saw fit to throw an as yet unidentified explosive at the old body , totally disintegratingit . The god Vishnu , of course , continues to exist in the various hits of the old body that were so criminally and so savagely scattered around Madison Square Garden . Presently , he will either reassemble those fragments and appear amongst us as he was or he will select anp162altogether new body in which to reappear . We shall just have to wait , and see . " " This is all very fanciful , Dr. Lowell , " said a tough Barbara Walters type . " But what I do n't understand is why Kalki or Vishnu or whoever would allow somebody to blow him up like that , anyway . " " Karma , dear lady . Fate . Destiny . It was meant to be and so it was . " So Kalki knew he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Vishnu knows what was , what is and what will be . " " But did Kalki tell you in advance that he expected to be blown up on the TV ? " " Yes , he did . He predicted everything . " This had the desired effect . News was now being made . Everyone shouted at once . When did Kalki know ? What did he say ? Bruce 's voice was the loudest ; and he was heard by all when he asked , " Did Kalki tell you why he was going to let this happen to him ? " " I am so glad , dear Mr. Sapersteen , that you should be the one to ask me that . " Glowing with sweat from the TV lights , Giles looked almost healthy . Everyone leaned forward to hear what he would say . " To begin with , " he began , " we are all of us involved in a most intricate ceremony . Think of the end of this cycle of creation as a sort of dance . Indeed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Siva begins the Tandava Dance , or dance of eternity . For Siva is also known to the gods as Nataraja , the king of dance . " " How do you spell Siva ? And who is he or she ? " The man from the Associated Press was required to get straight what news there was . The rest of the print media dealt mostly in opinion . Giles spelled Siva . He also explained that Siva. was one of the three aspects of the single god . For some reason , the Christians in the salon found this difficult to understand even though their own religion involvedan equally tripartite or trilateral god . Mary Baker Eddy , bless her , never went in for this kind of nonsense . It was enough that she herself had three names . " So let me return , if I may , to the image of the dance . " Giles was in full stride or gallop now . " Kalki appears . Makes a gesture . Disappears . Reappears . Is transformed . Moves to left , to right . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he watches us . Because he is testing us . " " For what ? " asked Bruce.  | " For our faith . Now I must give you a most solemn warning . Those who believe that Kalki ceased to exist in Madison Square Garden are doomed never to achieve nirvana . Those who have faith in Kalki 's return will know paradise , and soon . " Giles had a lot of guts , if nothing else . To unreel that sort of line to the press was asking for it . And there was a lot of it . The black lady from The Village Voice spoke , " You said a while back that April 3 is the new date for the end of the world , is that right ? " Journalists always liked to answer the question that they have asked on the ground that it might turn an essentially one-way street into a thoroughfare . As Giles reaffirmed the date , I motioned to Geraldine . We left together , unnoticedby the crowd . They reminded me of a pack of wolves . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for in those television documentaries . Giles was plainly wolves ' dinner . Geraldine and I walked back to the Americana Hotel . She was tense , guarded . She agreed with me that McCloud was the murderer . " But he 's safe . They 'll never catch him ... in time . " On Lexington Avenue we watched a group of Kalki boys and girls . They offered their literature , as politely as always . But no one took the pamphlets . Even the white paper lotuses were refused . The mood had changed overnight . " It 's all over , " said Geraldine . She seemed sad . " Is n't Kalki returning ? " I probed . " Yes . " Geraldine was brisk . " But even so , this phase is over . " Geraldinemade a funny sort of pushing-to-one-side gesture . " They 're all excluded now . " " Who 's excluded ? " " Everyone on earth except . . . " Geraldine stopped . She did not look at me . We crossed Park Avenue . The wind was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " I asked . " Except the ones who believe . " " And you 're doubtful about me ? " " I do n't know . Everyone seems to have given up . " For a moment we lingered in the hare garden of the Lever Building . Geraldine told me that most of the devoted mandali had defected . Some had been frightened . They had thought that whoever had murdered Kalki might want to make a clean sweep of his followers . Some feared that thep164American Government might find it irresistible to behave illegally and arrest or deport them . Some had just lost faith . " It 's really only us now . Lakshmi and Giles and me and ... " " Well , " I said quickly , " I 'm still available . I mean , I 'm still under contract , am I not ? " What did I believe as of March 18 ? I must be absolutely honest . I thought that Kalki was doornail dead . But I assumed that Giles would come up with some sort of substitute . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . April 3 would come and go . Meanwhile , I was eager for Kalki Enterprises to honor my contract as a pilot because it now looked as if my book with Doubleday might fall through in the same way that the pieces for The National Sun had fallen through because , as Bruce had said as I was leaving the press conference , " I 'll be writing the wrap-up piece on Kalki alone . " " Thanks , pal , " I said . I never saw Bruce Sapersteen again . All in all , a plus . Geraldine was grateful for my display if not of loyalty , of solidarity . When I asked about Lakshmi , Geraldine said , " No one has seen her , except Giles . " " But she must have known . " I played along . " I mean , if Kalki predicted this would happen ... " " It 's still a shock , " said Geraldine , matter-of-fact as always . I could not fathom her . Or any of them . I was genuinely sad that the beautiful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer in its original blond arrangement . There were a number of messages for me at the hotel . One was from Senator Johnson White . He wanted to meet me the following day , at my convenience . He was at the Plaza Hotel . I turned on the television in my room . In time to watch Arlene do the Jedda Coffee commercial . I never tire of her . After being soothed by Arlene , I was promptly disturbed by a special news report on the murder of the Hindu messiah from New Orleans at Madison Square Garden . First there was the by now obligatory bit of film showing the disintegration of horse and rider . Then an actor playing the part of a journalist looked into the camera and said , " The murder is thought to be the work either of a rival religious group or of a rival narcotics ring . A spokesman for the Reverend Sun Moon denies any complicity in the murder and quotes the Korean messiah as saying how sorry he is to hearp165of the death of the Hindu messiah from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many fans all over the world as Kalki . Various Mafia capon all around the country have denied any knowledge of the murder of what many believed was a leading trafficker in drugs . " The drug connectionwas now entirely in the open . Then Jason McCloud 's round black face filled the screen . He stood between a large American flag and a globe of the world . He seemed a bit incoherent . " That 's true , Jim . " He spoke to an invisible questioner . " I mean Bill . The Drug Enforcement Administration is . Abso-lutely . " " That 's for sure , Mr. McCloud ? " " For sure , Bill . I could say , no way . But I wo n't . I will say that Kalki Enterprises are under investigation , and now that the mastermindhimself has been removed from the scene by a rival gang , we will be able , I am sure , to somehow nail once and for all this dread octopus whose tentacles extend from the poppy fields of Turkey to the playgrounds of Buffalo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of we Americans feel a lot safer knowing that Jason McCloud is on the job . " I decided that Geraldine was right . McCloud was safe . Between the flag and the globe , he was invulnerable . The next image on the screen must have been recorded only minutes before . There was Giles . He was coming down the gangplank of the Narayana . Suddenly a man stepped in front of him . Giles looked startled . The man handed him an envelope . According to a voice-over : " Dr. Giles Lowell is now being subpoenaed by the Senate Drug and Narcotics Abuse Committee . " The camera came in for a close shot of Giles . He showed his teeth , like a tiger at bay ; no , worse , a tiger at sea . " The committee will be meeting in New York City this week ... "  |p166SENATOR  WHITE WAS INSTALLED IN A CORNER SUITE AT THE PLAZAHotel . From tall windows , there was a fine view of Central Park . Although flowers from admirers decorated every table of the sitting room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In shirt sleeves , the Senator was talking on the telephone . A male secretary motioned for me to sit down . I stood . The Senator concluded his conversation . I was given a brilliant fortieth or maybe forty-first President of the United States smile . " Sit down , Teddy . Get a load off those pretty feet . I 've just about cracked the largest drug ring in the world . I 'll see you later , Teddy , " he said , not to me but to the secretary . Same name . " In a few minutes we will be joined by an agent from the CIA . Who has the goods . " White punched a tiny fist into a tiny hand , making a small sound . " You wanted to see me , Senator . " " Yes . " White put on his solemn State of the Union face . He looked historic . Mount Rushmore in rosy soap . " As a good American , Teddy , than which you are  --  and I can always tell  --  no other , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4 . Naturally , you 'll want to be briefed on exactly what to say which is why I have proposed this little get-together with me and the man from the CIA . But first , Teddy , what do you think happened at Madison Square Garden ? " Under the circumstances , I thought this an odd question . So I gave him an odd answer . " Well , for one thing , Kalki filled the Garden . And you said he would n't . " " There was a lot of paper . " White lapsed into show business lingo . " Paper " meant those free tickets that are given out in order to make it look as if there is a full house . " There was no paper . The house , " I show-bizzed , too , " went clean . "  | " Be that , " said White snippily , " as it may . What exactly happened at the end ? " " Kalki was murdered . " I decided to follow the party or Giles Lowell line . " As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the story , is it ? " " That 's what happened . " " Did Kalki ever tell you that he expected to be murdered ? " " In a way , yes . " Since I was in the dark , I saw no reason not to share any darkness with White . It was unlikely that he knew anything I did not . White scratched his head in such a way that the cowlick in the back stood straight up . He looked a country slicker . " Well , now I 'm just a boy from up the creek a ways , and what I do n't . . . dohn unnerstan is jest who in tarnation lobbed that big ole bomb at Jim Kelly and his real nice white horse . " I gritted my teeth . White 's voice was like a plate of cold okra . I hate okra of any kind . I answered noncommittally . " The FBI are supposed to be investigating . " " They 're hopeless . " White dropped the accent . " They are n't even sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came from . Or who threw it , assuming it was not already in place , with a timer attached . Anyhoo , that ai n't no concern of us'n . " Into a frying pan filled with lard went the okra . " Now , ole buddy . I got me a theory . And it is this . Dr. Giles Lowell set that bomb . " " Why ? " " ' Cause he wants to take over the Mob . " " I do n't buy that , Senator ! " " Well , I 'm a-peddlin ' , ole buddy . " I broke down . I swept frying pan and okra to the ground , metaphoricallyspeaking . " Please , Senator . Do n't talk Southern to me . I mean , it 's had enough listening to the President and his wife and his brothers and his sisters and his sons and their wives and his aides and his mother without having you , the white hope of the Republican party and I pray our next president , coming on like Li'l Abner when what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I laid it on . White surrendered . Ile flashed a winner 's smile . " Lordy ! " he said . Then he stopped himself in time . " I guess it 's contagious , that trulyp168awful accent we hear morning , noon and night in Washington . Anyways . . . I mean , anyway , Teddy , I always knew you would end up in my corner if only because fiscal responsibility is my watchword . " Politiciansdid not talk so much as respond to buttons pushed . Somehow or other , one of us had pressed " fiscal responsibility . " Or was it " watchword " ? With some effort , we got ourselves back on track , and I helped White push the Kalki button . " Teddy , " he was grave , " I want you to testify that during the period of your employment as Kalki 's personal pilot , he told you on more than one occasion that , a , he was the actual head of this great narcotics ring and , b , that he feared Dr. Lowell would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Senator , you 're asking me to commit perjury before a Senate com-mittee . " " I 'm asking you , Teddy , to tell the truth , and nothing but the truth . " White 's contact lenses reflected , disagreeably , my anxious face . " The truth is , " I said , " Kalki never said either a or b to me . " " I think , Teddy , that you are showing signs of being an uncooperativewitness . " Capped teeth were bared . " And I think you know what happens to uncooperative witnesses who are in contempt of Congress . " I was ready to kick that one around . But we were interrupted by Teddy , the secretary , who poked his head in the doorway and announced , " He 's here . " In retrospect , where I seem now to be in happy residence , I am not as surprised as I was then to see Dr. Ashok . Although I never found Giles 's Dr. Ashok number as convincing as Dr. Ashok 's Dr. Lowell routine , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day with Senator White . But then he had to be . As Giles Lowell , he had been subpoenaed . With the greatest of ease , he could have ended up in the clink . It took a lot of guts to enter the lion 's den , beard in hand , as it were . I remember wondering whether or not White knew that Dr. Ashok was Dr. Lowell . After all , Morgan had hinted that White might be involved with Kalki Enterprises . The hallmark of the age of Kali was not good government . " My dear Senator ! What a pleasure ! And dear Madame Ottinger , my Katmandu pal ' ! Put it there ! " Golden eyes and teeth shining , Dr. Ashok gave me a fragile brown hand to shake . I Ic even smelled of curry powder . A true artist.  | " Dr. Ashok , we need your counsel , " said White , putting his tiny feet on the coffee table . " I am yours to command , like the genie in the lamp . Simply rub , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I always thought that Giles tended to overdo Dr. Ashok in a way that Dr. Ashok never overdid Dr. Lowell . But if White was not in cahoots with Giles , he was plainly taken in . " What are they saying at CIA headquarters ? " " Langley is more than usually confused . " Dr. Ashok patted my knee . I moved my chair away . " Dr. Ashok , I may as well jump in with both feet , " said White , adjusting a contact lens . " In the course of my committee hearings I am going to expose the murderer of Kalki . In order for me to do this , I must hold off the CIA , the FBI , New York 's finest . . . in short , anyone who might solve that murder before I do . So , Dr. Ashok , can you keep the lid on at Langley ? " " Dear Senator White , you have , I fear , overestimated my humble intelligence . Before I can begin to keep a lid of any sort in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ superb simile or even metaphor !  --  what preciselydo you have in your pot ? " " Kalki 's murderer is in my pot . " " His name , dear Senator White ? " " Giles Lowell , M.D. " Dr. Ashok rose , quietly , to greatness . " I take it , then , that you have in your possession absolute proof that the unsavory Dr. Lowell murderedhis partner in crime ? " " I have the proof . " " In what form ? " " That is for my committee to decide . I am making a joke , of course , " lie added seriously . " But since we know in advance the murderer 's identity , we should have no problem in constructing the case against liiimi . Particularly with your help , Dr. Ashok . Yours , too , Teddy ... " " No dice ! " I had decided that this was a matter best left unminced . " I do n't hold any brief for Dr. Lowell , but ... " " A truly evil man . " Dr. Ashok @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aside . " I assume , " I said , really curious , " that you would know . " " Indeed I do ! After all , I have been on the trail of Giles Lowell lo !  |p170these  many moons . I have followed his spoor from New Orleans to New Delhi to New York . And I mean to have his head . Do you hear me ? " Dr. Ashok added decibels to his voice as he repeated , " I mean to have his head ! " " So do I , Doc . " White took refuge in bumpkinhood . He teased the cowlick into a haystack . " ' Cause he 's a bad'un and that 's a fact . Even so , we got ta figure out jest how he got that bomb into the Garden , and where he had it hid . Our guess is that it was inside of that heathen idol . " " You are referring to Vishnu the god , who is holy to me , Senator . " There was gentle Weissean reproof in Dr. Ashok @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I guess you know that I 'm as great a believer in religious tolerance as the next senator and I respect every man 's god , blue or not . Now then , fellas , let 's put our thinking caps on and try to figure out how Dr. Lowell managed to set off that bomb ... " " Do n't you think you first ought to figure out why ? " I asked . " With Kalki out of the way , Dr. Lowell would control the largest narcotics ring in the world . Right , Dr. Ashok ? " " Right , Senator White . " Dr. Ashok poured his characteristic honey over the statesman . " Also , we must never rule out the mysterious passions that govern men . We have only to recall the Bawd of Arden 's greatest work of art in which the envious Agnello destroyed his admirablesuperior Dago , a man whose very name was a watchword for loyalty and integrity in the Vespasian Army . I see Dr. Lowell as Agnello and poor , yes , poor , weak , loving , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " White nodded , as if this speech made sense . I always found it odd that although Dr. Ashok suffered from metaphasis , Giles did not . But then Giles did not go in for quotations . Dr. Ashok turned to White . " I shall do my best to defuze Langley . Meanwhile , I am certain that Madame Ottinger will tell your committeehow , on more than one occasion , Kalki told her that he feared Dr. Lowell would one day kill him . " " But . . . " I started . Then stopped . After all , Dr. Lowell as Dr. Ashok or Dr. Ashok as Dr. Lowell was in charge . This was his show , not mine . " Agreed ? " Dr. Ashok gave me a yellowy smile . I said nothing . " Good girl ! " White was pleased . " I 've already prepared your statementto be made under oath . " He indicated a folder on the coffee table.  | " You can take it away with you . Read it , if you like . Then sign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ return to me . " I took a long leap in the dark . " What about Jason McCloud ? " White was suddenly tense . " What about him ? " " I think he was in on it . I was watching him just before the bomb went off . He was scared to death . " " But , my dear Madame Ottinger , what would his motive be ? " Dr. Ashok was silken . " The Drug Enforcement Administration has only one objective , and I believe that Senator White , unofficially at least , will bear me out . The single , nay , unique objective of the DEA is the increased sale of every kind of drug all over the world . " " Quite true . " White was equally to the point . " Without enterprises like Kalki 's , the DEA would wither away , as would my committee on Narcotics Abuse and Control with its very rich funding by the Congress . McCloud had absolutely no motive for killing Kalki . " " He was on Dr. Lowell 's payroll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Madame Ottinger . " Dr. Ashok laughed , as if someone had described to him what laughter was but then forgotten to give him an actual demonstration . " Of course McCloud was on Dr. Lowell 's payroll . After all , McCloud is a narc . But does n't that fact prove that he would not kill Kalki ? Geese that lay golden eggs are sacred to those who lust for gilded omelets . " I let it go . I realized that I was in the presence of two great Americanscontemplating crimes against the state . The secretary gave SenatorWhite a thin folder . " Tonight 's speech , Senator . In favor of Right to Life . " I do n't know why this one straw among so many should have proved to be the terminal one that broke the Bactrian back . " Senator White , arc you against abortion ? " " Teddy . " White was now standing up ; tiny feet wide apart . " Abortionis murder , " he said slowly and seriously . " In the first degree . " Dr. Ashok @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that with the meeting of sperm and ovum , karma begins and the dharma is off and , how you say ? running . " " Look here , White , the world is dying from too many people . " I gave him close to twenty minutes of my overpopulation rap . But just as I got to the cruncher : how world population will double in thirty-two years , White interrupted Inc . Ilc was very god at interrupting . Butp172then most of his adult life had been spent on television , evading issues and interrupting those with something to say . " That 's simply not true , Teddy . You have been duped by the sort of big lie that the communists want us to believe so that we will dwindle in numbers while they and their kind , in the Third World especially , increase and multiply and like the bay tree flourish . There is , Teddy , more than enough food and natural resources on this hospitable planet for a hundred billion people , but the big question is who can best exploit and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made this nation great ? or the slave world of the commies that does not even have the technical know-how to put color television into orbit ? " " That 's not the point . " I should have known by then that it was a waste of time to argue with a senator who was getting set to become the next or the next-but-one president of the United States . But I persevered : " The problem is that people are starving right here in the U.S.A. and there are n't enough jobs , or food ! " " Jobs ! There are more jobs , let me tell you , than there are willing persons to fill those jobs . Mrs. Johnson White is a homemaker that any nation would be proud of , but can she get a cleaning woman or person for less than three dollars and fifty cents an hour to help her homemake ? No , she ca n't , and even when one of those shiftless types does say that she 'll come to work , she does n't show , even with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lawn ? Who ? " By then Senator White was beginning to look as if he might have a stroke . Fortunately , Dr. Ashok was a master of the soothing arts . He intervened . He was understanding . He was helpful . He would do anything , anything to help a great American . Particularly this great American . He would also vouch for me . I , too , was a great American . We shook hands all around . As Giles and I walked down Seventh Avenue , I said , " I did n't know you were still doing your Dr. Ashok routine . " " I have no choice . " Giles went right on sounding like Dr. Ashok . The winds of March were cold , and full of torn newspapers and dust . " I 'm obliged to keep the better part of one foot in the enemy camp . " " But who 's the enemy , Giles ? I 've never been able to figure that one out . " Giles gave me a sidelong Ashokian glance . " You are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deep . Except , of course , to he precise ,  |p173still  waters do n't run at all . I have never ceased to be Dr. Ashok , on special assignment with the CIA . At the moment , it is wise for Dr. Ashok to surface and Dr. Lowell to submerge . I have . . . Giles Lowell has no desire to testify before the White committee , particularly now that we know just how poor Giles is being set up as a patsy by Johnny White . " We paused as an elderly white man with a baseball bat chased a young black man out of an Adult Book Store . As the colorful pair vanished into a side street , I said to Giles , " Now that you 're the head of Kalki Enterprises , I want you to know that I 'm willing to honor my contract if , of course , it has not been abrogated by events . " I was relieved to get this said . I had not yet paid the March alimony to Earl Jr. , and I did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " My dear Teddy , you are employed , as agreed , until April 3 . " Giles reached into Dr. Ashok 's pocket and took out a checkbook . Standing in front of the dirty window of an Orange Julius shop , he wrote me out a check for two months ' salary . " Thanks . " I put the check in my pocket . " And after April 3 ? " " Before that day , Kalki will have returned . On that day the age of Kali will end . Look ! A kosher hot dog ! I can not resist . " We ate garlicky hot dogs at a dirty counter . " What form is Kalki going to take ? " " His own . What else ? Attended by the Perfect Masters , he will ... what is your American phrase ? do most beautifully and terribly and finally his thing . " " Then they , " I pointed at the people coming and going , " will all die . " " Peaceful thought , is n't it ? No more pollution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No more television . Yes , Teddy , Walter Cronkite , The Hollywood Squares , The Gong Show , all will be as one with Nineveh and Tyre . " " I find it impossible to . . . " I was going to say believe but shifted to " conceive . It 's so brutal . I mean , think of all the children . " I thought of my two children . I had a pang of guilt for having seen so little of them ; for having thought so little of them . Beyond Motherhood had proved , psychically if not financially , to he really beyond . " Rut they are all going to die anyway . Just think ! Every bright-faced child on earth is scheduled to die scxmer or later , of cancer , Legion/naire 's disease , swine flu , whatever . But when Kalki raises high his sword , they will ... " " What ? " " They will cease to be . " A non-answer . I wiped bright yellow mustard off my fingers with a tiny paper napkin , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I thought him capable of anything . Did I believe that Kalki would return ? No . At the most , I expected Giles to announce that Vishnu had suddenly occupied his body , and that now he was the avatar . " Death , " said Dr. Ashok , as we went east along Forty-Second Street , " is as much a dream as life . Unfortunately , the human brain can not comprehend death because of death 's lack of symmetry , and symmetry is all-important to us since we think with two lobes of a single brain . We breathe air through two nostrils into two lungs whilst looking at and listening to the world outside through two eyes , two ears . Since we are obliged to pair all things , death seems to us to be all wrong because it is the ultimate imbalance . Once the see has sawed , there is no seesaw . So , where do we go from there ? We do n't go . We stay . What really matters is that as the matter of each of us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in yet another form . Naturally , there can be no loss of anything in a constant nature . But there is rearrangement . Once you have given up to death your own sweet self  --  a yummy treat for Yama  --  you will be rearranged . You will reappear , as a king or a turnip ; as a poet or a melon ; as a camel or a star . But no matter what your new arrangement , the unifying spirit  --  call me , I mean it , Vishnu  --  animatesall things at all times , and all things are constantly in flux , coming , going , rearranging . Ah , dear Teddy , have you not always known , deep inside you , that over the millennia you have died not once but a thousand million billion trillion times ? Starting with the big bang which is still within your body , a body that contains at this very instant all the elements that make up not only the universe but each of your previous incarnations as amoeba , fish , gibbonous ape . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nowhere near to final end stands or rather strolls the beauteous Teddy Ottinger as together we approach the southwest corner of Grand Central Station where the early edition of the New York Post has just arrived and I can sec from the headline that the vivacious proprietor from the Antipodes is very much in the saddle . "  |p175that  the vivacious proprietor from the Antipodes is very much in the saddle . " WAR FOR KALKI DRUG EMPIRE was the headline . " I see the large black hand of Jason McCloud at work , " Giles began to drop his Dr. Ashok mannerisms . " But McCloud works for you , does n't he ? " " He shakes me down from time to time . " " I believe that he killed Kalki . I know Dr. Ashok disagrees . But what do you think , Giles ? " Ah , Teddy , there are more things in heaven and on earth than there are anywhere else . Besides , the fault , dear beauty , is not within our sleeves but in our scars that we are ring-a-lings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost as tight as it had been before the murder in Madison Square Garden . In addition to the ship 's own guards , a number of plainclothesmen lurked about the dock , spying . There were times when it seemed that the principal function of the American Government in the age of Kali was to spy on its citizens . Lakshmi and Geraldine were in the main salon , getting drunk on Bloody Marys . I was about to advise them on the dangers of drink in the middle of the day . But I lost heart . They had been through a lot . " Teddy ! " Geraldine appeared genuinely happy to see me . So was Lakshmi . " I knew you 'd be loyal . " She embraced me . " Teddy Ottinger is a radiant Perfect Master , and an inspiration to the rest of us . " With that testimonial , Giles took off his white wig , poured vodka on a cocktail napkin and rubbed the make-up from his face . Then , restored to Lowelldom , he announced , " It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She was a bit unsteady on her feet . Geraldine took her arm . In their flowing saris the girls swayed , as if in a summer wind . They looked happy , and I wondered why . The vodka ? Kalki entered the salon . The others fell flat on their faces . Not wanting to let down the team , I did the same . I had decided that I was caught in a dream . There was no other way of explaining the figure in the doorway . Or , put another way , if this was not a dream , it was a ghost ; and I did not believe in ghosts . " Naniah Shivaya ! " The three chanted in unison five syllables that meant nothing to Inc . Kalki carne toward us. 1 ' ace like a mask of hanuuered gold . Voicep176purest bronze . " I am Siva , " said the voice . " The destroyer . " " Namah Shivaya , " chanted the others . Namah Shivaya is Sanskrit for " I bow to Siva. " 3S SIVA , THE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The blondness had congealed . He was ice-cold . I thought of glaciers , sliding south . Kalki sat down . I did not . I just stared at him , mouth no doubt ajar . Do I wake or sleep ? I asked myself . I recall thinking that if this was really a dream , the details had been nicely laid on . Dream-scenes usually lack proper ceilings or convincing vistas through open windows . But there was a ceiling to the room . And the skyline of New York harbor could be seen through open windows . If this was a dream , it had been meticulously constructed . Kalki looked up at me . The eyes were his eyes , no doubt of that . But now they were sapphire-hard . " You are with me . " This was a statement . I mumbled something idiotic , to the effect that our contract had never lapsed . " You 'll be doing some flying soon . " Kalki made a second statement . I was now certain that I was awake . And was more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explainer . " Dear Teddy , I can see that you are puzzled . " " Poor thing ! " Lakshmi was compassionate . " Tell her what happened , Giles . " " Gladly ! " Giles was in his element , a substance identical with hyperhyperbole . " On the evening of March 15 there existed two versions of James J. Kelly 's handsome body . One was , alas , destroyed by the villainousMcCloud , hit man , narc , political dreamer . Happily , we still retain our precious reserve model , and there lie sits . "  |p177Giles  always knew how to annoy me . Even at world 's end , he was able to get a rise out of me . I rose , to object . " You ca n't have two copies of the same person . " " The images of Vishnu are endless , " began Giles . I headed him off at the Weissean pass with Ottingerian logic . " Check one of two , Giles . Either this is Kalki and someone else was killed . Or Kalki was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one , Teddy . " Geraldine was pleased with my sharpness . Lakshmi smiled her special queen of heaven smile . " This is really and truly our Kalki . The original . Safe and sound . " " Then who was killed ? " I asked . " A double , " said Geraldine . " You see , we 've known all along thatsomeone , probably McCloud , would try to kill Kalki ... " " You knew all along ? " I was surprised . Kalki had only spoken of apossible attempt on his life . Geraldine nodded . " Four of the Five Perfect Masters knew . " " So why did n't you tell the fifth ? " " You were being tested , dear Teddy . " Giles produced a twinkle . " In the crucible , as it were , and with flying colors you have passed , to mix gorgeously a metaphor . " " So who was killed ? " " An actor named Rod Spenser . " " By McCloud ? " " Yes . " Giles did not , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could beat about . " The actor at Madison Square Garden , did he know what might happen to him ? " " We are not cruel , dear Teddy , only inexorable . " But Giles did not sound as impressive as the words warranted . I turned to Kalki . But he was no longer with us . The blue eyes were out of focus . I wondered , suddenly , if this Kalki was really the original . Might he not be a double , too ? I was still astride a nightmare , cantering toward terror . Lakshmi said , " Rod Spenser looked a lot like Kalki . He was also a good rider , which Kalki is n't . And since he 'd been out of work for almost a year ... " " You saw him in Arthur Penn 's Missouri Breaks . He played a cowboy , just a small part . " Geraldine was a movie buff . I am not . " I lc photographed well but he was n't very talented . "  | " But did n't he have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or his agent know that he 's missing ? And then wo n't someone figure out that he was the one who was killed and not Kalki ? " " Dear Teddy , do n't be such a worrywart ! " Giles was teasing , which always made me nervous . But Lakshmi was soothing , and to the point . " In ten days it will be April 3 , when all of Rod Spenser 's family , friends , associates will join him in . . . the next phase . " " And you will see it all , Teddy . " Geraldine sounded excited . " The Five Perfect Masters will preside at The End . " " Who are the other two Perfect Masters ? " I had never thought to ask . But then I had never taken any of them seriously until the actor on the white horse was killed . For me that was the turning point . ' I was now able to see beneath the familiar flesh of everyone alive the hard essential bone . I was frightened . " One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Giles sounded genuinely sad . " During our time of testing , he failed us . So did the fifth Perfect Master . Someone you did not know . Poor devils , they have now forfeited perfection and paradise . But since there must always be five of us in order to create spiritual harmony on this earth , Kalki and Lakshmi have condescended to act as Perfect Masters . So that , dear Teddy , is the ball game . " Giles was uncommonly pleased with himself . " So what , " I asked , " are we to do ? " " Fly . " Kalki had returned to his body . He turned to me , and for the first time he resembled his pre-Siva self . And I was now certain that the man I was talking to was really Kalki and not a double . I was relieved . A succession of Kalkis would have been intolerable . " You will fly the Garuda around the world at the equator . Then you will fly the Garuda around the world over the two poles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the message ? " " The fact of the flight . " " An itinerary is being prepared . " Giles sounded businesslike . " You will have a full 707 crew ... " As I was about to ask when I was to leave , Arlene Wagstaff entered the salon . She was made up for television , and sober as a judge . Kalki rose to greet Arlene . When she saw him , she gave a funny littlep179gasp , not unlike the one she did so effectively in her nasal decongestant commercial . " Sweet Jesus , you 're not dead ! Oh , but I knew it all along ! I mean , that was a special-effects trick back there in the Garden , was n't it ? Sure it was . You were putting us on . For the ratings . They went through the roof , too ! Well , let me tell you , I am absolutely and totally your greatest fan . Teddy , did n't I always say Kalki is a pussycat ? In fact , not since Monsignor Sheen was dropped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his . He radiated pre-Siva charm . " I 'm your admirer , Arlene . But then so is everyone else . I 'm glad you could come . " Arlene gave me a quick peck ; and a slow explanation . " Angel , I was flabbergasted when I got this call from my agent , saying would I sky in to Gotham and tape an interview about Kalki because the Kalki people wanted somebody the public loves and trusts , like me . My God , I 'm thirsty . But no drinkee before telly , that 's my cardinal rule . Anyway , I said , what 's there to say ? Was n't Kalki blown to bits before our very eyes on prime-time ? Who are you trying to kid ? Not that I really believed anything serious had happened to you ! " Arlene put her arm through Kalki 's . " He 's cuter in person ! " She winked at me . She turned to Kalki . " It was a special effect , was n't it ? Like in Towering Inferno ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Anyway , the William Morris office said , Arlene , we do n't know what this is all about but whatever it is it 's a firm offer . It 's also very hush-hush . Dr. Lowell wants you to do a special show , guaranteed to hit a top Nielsen , maybe even in the high forties . Well , I tried to call you , Teddy , but no dice . Anyway , since part of the contract was my telling nobody , I told nobody and here I am . You look good enough to eat , Kalki , if you do n't mind my saying so . " " You are thinking of Jesus Christ , dear Miss Wagstaff . He is periodicallyeaten by his followers in the course of something called Communion . " Giles smoothly started to unwind the overwound Arlene . " But Vishnu is never eaten . After all , how can one take a bite out of the sun ? Now then , I see that you are all made up and ready to go . " Giles indicated the beaded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Olay where she looked like Theda Bara . " And so are we . " " What 's happening ? " I asked Geraldine , in a low voice . But not sop180low that Arlene 's sharp ears did not detect a special relationship . Arlene tried hard not to frown . And failed . Yet we had never been exclusive , she and I. But jealousy is irrational . Arlene was aware that there was something between Geraldine and me . But though she was not pleased , she was a professional ; and duty came first . " This way , " said Kalki . He put an arm around Arlene 's waist . She was ecstatic . Geraldine answered me , " What is happening is now happening . Kalki is going to make a tape for television with your friend . " Together we went down a long corridor . Deep inside the ship a stateroom had been converted to a television studio . Technical crew and director were already on hand . Kalki sat cross-legged on a dais . Arlene sat in a chair beside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her lips . She was a quick study . At a gesture from Kalki , the taping began . Arlene looked at Kalki , with true and unfeigned adoration . It was clever of whoever it was ( Giles ? ) to select Arlene as an interviewer . Aside from being my friend , she plainly adored Kalki . She was , also , the greatest pitchperson on television . " Kalki . You . . . have . . . returned . . . from the dead ! " Arlene 's voice was reverent . " I am eternal . " Kalki glittered like those Northern lights you can see at forty thousand feet , flaring on the Arctic horizon . " I can not die . I alone was before all things . I alone shall always be . " " That 's very interesting . " Gamely , Arlene gave the conversational ball a push . " Were you surprised at what happened to you the other night in Madison Square Garden ? " " I know all things that have been , that are , that will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body and take up another . This one that you see . " Which looks very nice to me from where I am sitting . " Arlene gave him her contented , maternal glance , the one that she had brought to perfection in that commercial where the preferred detergent cleans in one second flat the children 's muddy clothes . " Now then , Kalki , what you 've done by . . . well , coming back from the dead , is something of a miracle to us civilians , both in and out of show business . " " I was never dead . " " Yes , " said Arlene , not listening . " I know . But now that you havep181come back to us like this , what are your immediate plans , if I may ask ? " " I am Siva . " Arlene had not been briefed on Siva . I could tell that she was thrown . But she covered up expertly . She had been doing this sort of thing for half a century . " That 's interesting . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Could you tell our audience a little bit about who Siva is ? And who you are , really ? Like where you were born , originally ? " But Kalki was now in full flow . He described Siva as he had described him to me that day in Central Park . Then he announced that at noon , Eastern Standard Time , April 3 , Siva would begin the dance of eternity and all human life would end . As usual , Kalki was his most effective when he was most matter-of-fact . " That is not really a very upbeat sort of message . " Arlene rallied , as best she could . " But death . . . Yama , as we call it . . . is peace , and peace is the ultimate blessing . " " But what about a message of hope for all of your many fans out there . For those of us who were rooting for you at Madison Square Garden and who are all pleased as punch that you were n't really killed but are back in the saddle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " A message of hope ? " Kalki smiled a most boyish and un-Siva smile . " All right . People of the world , enjoy yourselves . Do n't worry about the future . There will be no future . Delight in this world . Delight in each day . Delight in one another . Those of you who believe in me will continue forever , but in different forms . " So take this earth . It is yours . Everything is yours . Until I begin the dance of eternity , and all the stars go out . "  |p182SINCE  THE NETWORKS REFUSED TO TELECAST THE KALKI  --  ARLENE Wagstaff interview , Giles was obliged to buy thirty minutes of primetimetelevision . Although the networks decided , in their solemn jargon , " to pass " on the interview , they were eager to interview Kalki whose return , predictably , had caused a sensation . Sample headline ( New York Daily News ) : KALKI BACK FROM DEAD . Under this : " Hoax suspected : Garden Murder Done with Mirrors ? " " Teddy , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Morgan Davies . He was shameless . I had been dropped after Madison Square Garden . Now I was to be picked up again . I told Morgan that the ship had sailed . " Anyway , you do n't need me . You have Bruce Sapersteen . " Morgan started to wheeze , and beg . I took pleasure in hanging up on him . I no longer needed the Sun . Only that morning Doubledayhad told Herman Victor Weiss that once again his highly honed sentences were to be deployed in my behalf . These conversations took place the day after the taping in the sitting room of Arlene 's suite at the Regency IIntel , where I had spent thep183night . The evening before , the 6:oo News had reported that Kalki was alive and that Arlene would interview him . Arlene 's telephone never stopped ringing . I mixed the margaritas . Listened to Arlene talk simultaneously to me and into the telephone . " Who ? Stan Kamen ? " She put one hand over the receiver . " The William Morris office ! He 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stan , baby ! A series ? Norman Lear ? Well , not if Ross Hunter comes through with that co-production deal on The Amelia Earhart Story , starring Teddy Ottinger . The property 's hot , Stan . Reallyhot . " While Arlene dealed and wheeled , I twirled the knob of the television set . At regular intervals there were still pictures of Kalki talking to Arlene . A voice-over gave the time of the telecast . " That one picture , " said Arlene , putting down the receiver , " is worth one million dollars to me in this fiscal year alone ! " " What did you think of Kalki ? " " A liv-ing doll . " She spaced out the words . " But was I nervous ! I mean he 's got such balls . Such star quality . You can take your Alan Ladd  --  the father , I mean , not the son who is a doll and chief of production over at Fox where I expect a firm offer before the end of the week on the new Henry Hathaway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throw them out the window , because Kalki 's got it ! " " On the other hand , if Kalki 's right , there wo n't be any Henry Hathaway or Twentieth Century  --  Fox next week . " " Teddy , " said Arlene , missing the point , " I have been reading about and listening to this end-of-Hollywood bushwah for thirty or twenty years , and I 'm here to tell you that entertainment is here to stay ! So you do n't have L.B. Mayer and block-booking any more . So what ? You have the big movies for ABC . You have the mini-series for NBC . You have ... " Although Arlene had conducted the most important interview in the history of television , she had not understood a word that Kalki had said . She was like most people . World 's end was too much to cope with . Far easier to think of Kalki as just another TV superstar who was about to score an incredibly high Nielsen rating.  |p184THE  DAY OF THE TELECAST SENATOR WHITE ARRIVED IN NEW YORK , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , White announced , " Special hearings will be held here in New York , a great city that can always depend upon my support , financially and otherwise , in the exciting years to come . Working together for fiscal responsibility , we can and we will put the Big back into the Big Apple . In the next few days my committee will be investigating the alleged connectionbetween a certain alleged religious movement and an international drug ring . Our first witness will be James J. Kelly , also known as Kalki . " Senator White was able to get this message ( and himself ) onto the 6:oo News . Although White made the next day 's headlines , he was upstaged . The subpoena that had been prepared for Kalki was not served because Kalki had disappeared . The Narayana was searched from top to stern . Kalki was gone . In fact , all the Perfect Masters had vanished except for me . Luckily , the committee did not know that I was a Perfect Master . Nevertheless , as Kalki 's pilot , I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I had no idea where anyone was . The committee was fit to be tied . Senator White ordered the police of New York City to conduct a manhunt for Kalki . The Police Commissioner refused to do anything on the ground that this was a federal , not a local matter . In any case , there was very little that the police could do as they were all out on strike not only for an increase in their pensions but for added human dignity . During this confusion , I said goodbye to Arlene . She headed back to Los Angeles . The Amelia Earhart Story starring Teddy Ottinger was , she declared , " absolutely in the hag . " I hoped so . Privately , I was notp185optimistic . That project had always been doomed . . . like Amelia herself . I rang Earl Jr . " About time you called , Teddy . The children keep asking when is Mummy coming to visit us . Of course , Lenore is wonderfulwith them . Her hair is mostly grown back . But she has no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has left her limp as a rag . It 's also a pretty terrible burden , having to undergo all that therapy while acting as a mother to two wonderful kids . " " The alimony check for March is in the mail , " I said . Down cooled Earl Jr . " I see where this messiah of yours did n't really get killed on the TV . " " He did , " I said , not wanting to get into that subject , " and he did n't . " " Uh-huh . " Earl Jr . was disagreeable . " So what 's going to happen on April 3 ? Has he got an encore ? " " Watch tonight . " The telecast ( paid for by Kalki Enterprises ) rang up a Nielsen rating of 46.7 . This is the sort of rating that the Super Bowl gets . Or so the experts said . I still have no idea what sport it was that they played in the Super Bowl . My editor at Doubleday said that if the program had not been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history , because everyone would be watching in order to see whether or not Kalki got himself killed again . As it was , people were eager to see if this Kalki was the same as the one that they saw killed at the Garden . If not , was the new Kalki a convincing double ? On the order of that perennial phenomenon of those years , the new Nixon . The next day it was generally agreed that what had been revealed was indeed the original Kalki , which led to a good deal of wild speculation . Many pundits thought that the Kalki-Wagstaff interview had been taped before Madison Square Garden . Others thought that the i-urder at the Garden had been no murder at all but some sort of stunt , to increase interest in Kalki . White 's subpoena did not exactly diminish interest in Kalki . I watched the program alone in my room at the Americana . Kalki was brilliant . Arlene was expert . The instant the show was off the air , the telephone began to ring . The first caller was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ havep186gone underground , " he said . " But we shall find them , dear Madame Ottinger , never fear ! We shall bring them to earth . The foot 's agame , as your Bard of Auden would say . I shall meet you just outside the men 's room at Grand Central Station tomorrow noon , with instructions . This telephone line has been bugged . But only by the CIA . Therefore , whatever you say to me you can regard as privileged . " Arlene rang next . She was thrilled with her performance . Ross Hunter was prepared to co-produce The Amelia Earhart Story . With me . Or so he said . The next call was from Jason McCloud . " Where , " he said in his loud toneless voice , " is Kalki ? " " I have no idea . " Which was the truth . " Senator White 's just this minute signed a subpoena . And you know what ? It 's got your name on it , Ms. Ottinger . You will be served tomorrow . Then on Wednesday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the subcommittee , at the Waldorf-Astoria . We will be meeting in the Mermaid Room . " McCloud hung up . I remember thinking that he was very bold indeed . Dr. Ashok and I met as planned at Grand Central Station . Dr. Ashok carried a brief case . I noticed that not only was the wig on straight , but the performance was less surreal than usual . In fact , he was nervous . " Have you been served yet ? " Dr. Ashok had not been joking about my telephone line being bugged . " Not yet . " " Good . Do n't go back to the hotel . You can pick up what clothes you need right now . Then go to Kennedy Airport . The Garuda is ready for take-off . The crew is on stand-by . The cargo is aboard . And here is your flight plan . " I took the brief case . " Where is Kalki ? " " Out of sight if not out of mind or as the Bawd of ... " I cut him short . " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Read your instructions . " A well-dressed black man entered a telephone booth just back of us , and began to urinate . Drunk , he had thought that he had already made it to the men 's room . No one paid the slightest attention to him . Dr. Ashok and I moved out of range . " Your trip is essentially a gesture , a symbol of Vishnu 's power . " Neither Dr. Ashok nor I could keep from staring at the telephone booth from which came the sound of water , rather like that made byp187Niagara Falls in Arlene 's Sada Soda Water commercial . A slow flood began to spread out onto the cement floor . " Your flight plan divides the planet into quadrants . You will go once around the world at the two poles . En route , the plane will , at specified intervals , drop its cargo ... " " Of what ? " Lotuses . The symbol of immortality . Of Vishnu , the all-pervading . Of Siva , and his love . " " That 's quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is going to be a super-lottery . Thousands and thousands of winners of jumbo cash prizes or , as the author of the Old Testament 's Adverbs so wisely said , ' He that maketh waste to be rich shall be innocent . ' No matter . The crew knows what to do . All you will have to do is fly the aircraft . Of course , you may want to speak to the curious at the different fueling stops . So I 've prepared several little speeches , just in case . " " When do I get back ? " I could imagine the sort of speeches Giles had prepared ; and vowed to make only my own . " You will return April 2 . You will join us aboard the Narayana , which will be anchored off the Battery in downtown Manhattan . All instructions are here . " Dr. Ashok indicated the brief case in my hand . " Go to it , Teddy Ottinger , Test Pilot and Perfect Master ! " The occupant of the telephone booth had gone to sleep , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The crew was first-rate . My instructions were surprisingly intelligent . Giles had figured out exactly when and where I would need to put down for refueling and maintenance . As a result , the flight went off without a hitch . I felt like Amelia ; particularly on the trip that followed the line of the equator . I was only sorry that Lae was not part of the flight plan . I would like to have seen the last airstrip she ever saw . Wherever I did put down , I was met by the press . The Australian press was unusually aggressive . Apparently , they had once been able to drive Frank Sinatra out of Australia . This feat had made them overconfident . I was mobbed at the Sydney airport . I did my best to appear serene . " What 's this lotus dingus you 're promoting ? " asked one of them . " We 're not promoting anything . " I handed out white paper lotuses.  |p188I  also told them about the Lotus Lotteries . And the cash prizes . The press @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dozen cameras recorded this exchange . " You mean you 're not selling these lotuses ? " " We simply let them fall upon the air . They are the symbol of ... " I had worked out rather a pretty speech . But no one wanted to hear it that afternoon in Sydney . A journalist from Melbourne asked , " So what are you selling on this trip ? " " Nothing . " " So what are you doing ? " The man from Melbourne was persistent . He had a hearing aid in his left ear . " Besides dropping paper flowers all over the map . " " Kalki is making one final gesture . He wants you to contemplate eternity before the end ... " There was rude laughter . " And the end is due to take place April 3 ? " " Yes . " I smiled sweetly . " At noon . Eastern Standard Time . " More rude laughter . I turned my back on the lot of them . Conferred with the maintenance crew . But the journalists would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be like On the Beach ? " A reference to an end-of-theworldmovie made years ago in Australia , starring Ava Gardner . When the local press had asked Gardner why the picture was being made in Australia , she had replied , " Well , it 's about the end of the world and , God knows , this place is the absolute end . " The press tried but failed to drive her out . She was obviously a good deal tougher than her ex-husband Mr. Sinatra . Finally , bored by dull questions , I gave them selected arias from Giles 's richest and most flowery speech . Ending with " The lotus is the symbol of the creator of the universe , a reminder of man 's oneness with the spirit of the cosmos . Believe in Brahma , Vishnu and Siva , and you will achieve heaven . " They were not buying this line in Sydney . They got personal . Finally , when asked if it was true that I was a lesbian , I belted the reporter from the Bulletin . This made for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hour . Elsewhere , I was well received . For one thing , Kalki 's television interview with Arlene had been shown in every country that had television . People were fascinated by him . I ) id they believe in Thep189End ? I do n't think so . Did I ? No , not really . I was , obviously , curious to see how he was going to explain the approaching Non-End . At least once a day I talked by radio to Giles aboard the Narayana . " You 're doing a bang-up job , Teddy . We 're getting the wildest press coverage . So just keep those lotuses floating through the air , like millions of kisses from the all-loving Siva . " Finally , right on schedule , I landed the Garuda at Kennedy Airport . I was exhausted . Overnight bag and logbook in hand , I got into a waiting limousine . And went straight to sleep . I was awakened by Geraldine 's excited embrace . " Teddy ! " she cried . " You 're a hero ! " " What for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We were at the Battery , a sort of park in downtown Manhattan , with a view of the bay . Some distance from shore , the Narayana rode at anchor . Because of a recent oil spill , the waters of the bay were a thick gumbo in which dead birds floated alongside dead fish . We tried not to breathe too deeply as we climbed into the Narayana 's launch . Geraldine kept telling me how delighted they all were . " Giles was terrified something would go wrong . But Kalki said , ' Teddy Ottinger is the best , ' and you are ! " With our arrival in the main salon , the Five Perfect Masters were at last united . I was embraced by each in turn . Giles was beside himself ( but that self , thank God , was Giles and not Dr. Ashok ) . " You did not fail me , dearest Teddy . Others may have had their doubts about you , but not I. " Kalki put his arm around my shoulders . " You have been my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " the one that holds the lotus . You did a swell job . " Lakshmi pointed to a map of the world on an easel . " You see ? " she said . " We kept careful track of you . " The Garuda 's flight plan made a cross on the map . Each refueling stop was starred . Someone had also written in each day 's wind direction and velocity . " The lotuses are now in every part of the earth , including the two poles . " Giles tapped the cross at the map 's center . " All in all , a superb exercise in logistics for which our two scientists , Geraldine and I , akshnli , are to he commended , as well as you , dearest Teddy , the sole executor of the master plan . " " The lotus , " said Kalki , " is for all men now . "  |p190THAT  NIGHT WE ALL HAD DINNER ABOARD THE NARAYANA , EXCEPTfor Kalki . He would not be seen again , I was told , until noon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sleep in a hot bath and did not wake up until the water turned cold . Shivering , I rubbed myself hard with a bath towel . Noting the large blue K monogram , I again marveled at the money that was being spent . My two trips around the world must have cost a quarter of a million dollars . I also recall thinking that if nothing happened the next day , Kalki would never be able to recoup financially . As I dressed ( black velvet : a chilly night in April ) , I wondered if he might not be planning to hold up the world . Something on the order of : If you do n't pay me X millions of dollars , I will set off a cobalt bomb in Grand Central Station . Geraldine was alone in the salon . She looked lovely . . . in red ! That took courage , I thought , and a degree of good luck to pull off . Redheads are usually washed out by all strong colors excepting the complementarygreen . In a low voice she warned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day 's activities because " The waiters are all agents . " Geraldine made Bloody Marys for two . I prefer plain vodka but have never told her . Reticences between people are often strange . I asked her what Kalki was planning for the next day . Geraldine said , " Dance . " " I hope he 's been doing his barre work . But then after he dances ... " Geraldine put a finger to her lips . " The rooms are bugged , " she said . She was maddening . With a secret smile , she turned on the television . The news was about to go on . I drained my glass . I was drunk . Fatigue , jet lag , vodka , together did their merry work . I was hectoring . ( Why no verb from Achilles ? ) " Well , then where will he dance ? "  | " On a barge , off the Battery . There 's going to be live television coverage . For some reason this last detail struck me as unnaturally funny . Loonlike , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me the way that I used to look at Arlene when drink had turned her head in a wrong direction . Fortunately , the appearance of Walter Cronkite had if not a sobering , a solemnizing effect . The news that Cronkite thoughtfully read for us was pretty much par for the course at the end of the age of Kali . Energy was in short supply . Arab oil was going up in price . A new ice age had just been predicted by all those scientists who had not predicted a new inferno due to the so-called " greenhouse effect " due to increased man-made fumes in the atmosphere due to all the due to 's that had together made a man-made chain or noose about the human race 's neck . There was famine . There was a mysterious new epidemic rampaging around the world . There was an announcement from the President that he had every confidence ( he himself spoke to us with deep sincerity ) that the Vice-President would be his running mate which meant , of course , that the Vice-President would not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smile on Walter Cronkite 's face as he read : " Tomorrow the Hindu messiah from New Orleans , James J. Kelly , sometimes known as Kalki or Vishnu or Siva , will appear at noon Eastern Standard Time on a barge in the Hudson River just off the Battery in downtown Manhattan and , as the god Siva , Mr. Kelly will begin what he calls ' the dance of eternity . ' According to the ancient Hindus , when Siva does this dance all worlds will be annihilated . So the big question is this : is Jim Kelly of New Orleans really the god Siva ? If he is , then tomorrow is the end of the world . " Walter Cronkite allowed one eyebrow to lift . Had it not lifted , there would have been a national panic . The Dow Jones would have dropped through the floor . " And that 's the way it is , Monday , April 2 ... " Dinner was peccably served by two waiters . But then it is not easy to deal plates and serve food while listening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lapful of petite marmite as one bemused agent 's ladle missed the soup plate . Giles gave a lecture on food . " We are being slowly poisoned to death . " HE listed the poisons , as we ate without pleasure the poisons named . Each of us knew by heart the cadmium-mercury litany . Then ,  |p192together  , we mourned what dedicated horticulturalists had done to the American tomato , a vegetable fit for shipping but not for eating . Lakshmi raised her wineglass . " To organic food ! " We toasted organicfood . " There will be nothing else , " she said , " in our future . " The two waiters exchanged wide-eyed glances . " Our future " was a key phrase . Shortly after dinner , we were joined by Jason McCloud ; he was accompanied by Owen Prager , the chief of the Internal Revenue Servicesquad that had been investigating Kalki Enterprises . Mr. Prager reminded me that we had met at the ashram . He was a courteous little man . " We 're here to see Kalki , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the salon . Giles served Jason Scotch . Prager asked for Sanka . " I have an ulcer , " he said . " I not only give ulcers , I also , " he laughed softly through his nose , not a good sound , " get ulcers ! " His little joke . We left it where it belonged , in Lilliput . Giles was all oil , and extremest unction . " I 'm afraid that Kalki has withdrawn for the evening . " " As have I , " said Lakshmi . " And I , " said Geraldine . And they both swept from the room . I remained . I was curious . " We 're on government business , Lowell . " McCloud 's constitution must have been uncommonly strong . He drank glass after glass of Scotch , and did not get drunk . But then his normal manner was abrupt , nonserial , boorish . Prager was polite , and of course abstemious . " We have finished our audit of Kalki Enterprises , Dr. Lowell . And I think it only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in back taxes , something in the very expensive neighborhood of four million dollars . I have the exact figures in my brief case . " " But the big casino , " said McCloud , " is that you , personally , are also guilty of fraud . " " Now , now , Mr. McCloud . Let 's not get ahead of ourselves . " Prager was stern . Admonishing . " We at the IRS never assume that anyone is innocent until he is proved guilty . That is the American way . " Prager looked pleased as punch with his little speech . Giles coolly monished right back . " Naturally , I will consult myp193lawyer . " I remember wondering why he was not more upset . If anything , he seemed amused . " You will be arrested tomorrow , " said McCloud , " by the New York Police . " Giles was rummaging through a handsome eighteenth-century secretary . " I believe , " he said , " that the police are still on strike . " " The strike was settled this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liquid in his glass . La vie en whisky . I 've always regretted that I was never able to see and hear Edith Piaf in person . I owned most of her records once . Earl Jr . got them at the time of the settlement . Yet he only liked country music , as sung by urban Americansof the sixties . I hate Bob Dylan . " No public employee or servant has the right , " said Prager suddenly , " to strike against the state . That principle was laid down by Calvin Coolidge when he was governor of Massachusetts and it is a precept whose denial , Dr. Lowell , spells social anarchy ! " Prager spoke with conviction . " You do n't need to tell me that , Mr. Prager . " Giles removed a brief case from the secretary . " I completely agree . " Giles gave McCloud the brief case . " These are the papers that you asked for . " " They better , " said McCloud , " all be there . " I was astonished at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Surely , he must have guessed at the meaning of this transaction . But he was busy with his own brief case . " I would like , if I may , " he said , " to go over with you the high points of our audit . " " By all means . " Giles sat down ; looked alert . " We think , speaking purely from a criminal point of view , that your management of the affairs of Kalki Enterprises has been superb . " " Thank you , Mr. Prager . " " You 're welcome and  --  hats off to you , sir ! You make the Mafia seem nice-nelly . I should also tell you that because of your flair for bookkeeping , our agents have put in close to twenty thousand man-hours on this project . " " Twenty thousand ! " McCloud whistled . " What 's your annual budget , Prager ? I mean the actual budget of the IRS . " As the two bureaucrats compared budgets , I lost my second wind ,  |p194There  was no third . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Good night , dear Teddy , " said Giles , tenderly . " Sweet dreams . We shall meet at breakfast . " I remember thinking that , under the circumstances , he was tempting fate . Fate , tempted , duly struck . Shortly before dawn , the police came aboard ship . Giles was arrested . I slept through whatever commotion there was . By the time I was up , Giles was gone and the decks were crowded with New York 's finest . The morning was bright but cold . Snow had been predicted . Wind north-northwest . Lakshmi was on deck , wearing a heavy winter coat over her sari . Geraldine had exchanged sari for a practical tweed suit from Peck &; Peck . I joined them at the railing of the ship 's prow . Together we looked down at the floating platform on which Kalki would do his dance . Just opposite us , the ubiquitous television crews had placed their cameras on a tugboat . I thought of the director from Katmandu . Red , white and blue sneakers . Blond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sudden spasm of lust , no doubt brought on by the hysteria of the occasion . Lakshmi was nervous . I asked why . " They 're trying to arrest Kalki , " she said . " That 's a good reason . Where is he ? " " Hidden , " said Geraldine . In the cold April light her three freckles looked like miniature copper pennies . " But then he will have to come on deck at noon , " I said . Lakshmi nodded . " That 's the problem . " The police were still searching the ship . They were everywhere . They seemed to be having a wonderful time . I ca n't think why . They laughed , made jokes , waved at the television cameras on the tugboat . Although they were very much aware of us , none came near . . . except McCloud . He stalked across the deck like the monster in a low-budget Frankenstein . He was still high from the night before . Except that this particular morning was , for him , an extension of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had spent the night talking to Giles . After the arrest , McCloud had eaten a hearty breakfast , and continued drinking . " Good morning , ladies . " McCloud was courtly . We greeted himp195coldly . " Sorry about our friend Giles . But just as soon as he posts bail , he 'll be out . " " Where are they holding him ? " asked Geraldine . " First Precinct . That 's i6 Ericsson Place . Two blocks south of Canal . We 'll have him back with us by tomorrow at the latest . " " That 's late , " said Lakshmi . " What was the charge ? " I asked . McCloud rattled off a series of crimes that were , in number if not in magnitude , presidential . The chief crime was trafficking in narcotics . " Sorry about this , " McCloud added . He looked almost guilty . After all , triple agent or not , he had been an employee of Giles for a long time . " The least , " said Geraldine , with some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until noon . " " Well , there 's been all this pressure on me . " McCloud sounded vague . " Senator White , you know . Noon , " he repeated . He blinked . Remembered what was afoot . " Hey , what 's going to happen ? " " Siva will dance , " said Lakshmi . " But not , " I said , " if he 's arrested . " " Jason , " Lakshmi took McCloud by his right arm , " you 've got to talk to the police . You must explain to them that no one must come near Kalki until after the dance . " " Well , " said McCloud . And stopped . And thought . Then , " I do n't know if I can . You see , the warrants have already been sworn ... " " People are often given an hour 's grace , " I invented . " To put their affairs in order . Say goodbye to loved ones ... " " But these charges are pretty serious . " I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ triple agent , one is triply armed . " I know for a fact , " I said , speaking slowly , as to a child , " that my friend  --  and yours , too  --  Senator Johnson White is going to be very , very upset when he finds out that Kalki has been arrested before his hearing tomorrow . " McCloud looked ill . I had scored . " I know , " he said , dismally . I , akshmi scored , too . " Dearest Jason , you are such a friend of ours . And you 've been so close to us for so many years ! I 'm sure you do n't want anything unpleasant to happen to your associates . " " I am not , " said McCloud , " an associate . " It was plain that prison doors had begun to open in that treacherous mind.  | " No matter what you are , " said Geraldine , " you can certainly convince the police to hold off for at least a day . If you do , you will make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Without a word , McCloud left us . We could see him on the ship 's bridge , talking to several high-ranking policemen . " Will he hold them off ? " I asked . " If he does n't , he goes to jail , " said Geraldine . " We 've paid him off for years . And we 've got the proof . " Lakshmi was uncharacteristically grim . " And some of the proof was given him last night by Giles . " " The brief case ? " I asked . " Yes , " said Lakshmi . " It was the payoff for what he did at Madison Square Garden . " I was , momentarily , floored or decked . But before I could speak , the noon siren went off . There was silence aboard ship . Then music played over the public-address system . . . sitars , flutes , horns ; and Kalki appeared on deck . Except for a tiger 's skin at the waist , Kalki was nude ; his torso had been smeared with ashes ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be miniature human skulls hung about his neck . Three writhing snakes were tangled in his hair . He carried a small drum . I have no idea whether or not McCloud had persuaded the police to postpone the arrest . I do know that one look at that glittering figure and everyone fell silent . There were no more jokes , no laughter . No one made a move to stop Kalki . . . to stop Siva , as he walked toward the bow of the ship . When Siva passed the three of us , we bowed and said , " Namah Shivaya . " We were neither heard nor seen . Siva descended the ladder to the floating platform . A circling plane released a cloud of white paper lotuses . For an instant , the April sun was completely obscured . Then there was confusion as the police scrambled to pick up the paper lotuses . Siva struck the drum with his right hand . Unnoticed by the lotuscollectorson deck , the dance of eternity began . As Siva twisted and turned , leapt and whirled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  |p197PASCAL  : " Le dernier acte est sanglant , quelque belle que soit la comedie en tout le reste . " I had better translate that . After all , I am the last person on earth who knows French . " The last act is bloody , no matter how charming the rest of the play . " I leave to future historians all of the earlier acts , charming or not . I must now do the best I can to describe the last act , and its bloodiness . When the dance of eternity ended , the age of Kali ended . Four billion or so men , women , children died . Not all at once . Some may have survived for as long as a week . We shall never know for certain . In most cases , death was swift  --  a matter of seconds , minutes , a mercifullyunconscious hour . How did this happen ? Let me go step by step . This is the dangerous part of my narrative . A false step and . . . no history . First things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until late afternoon . He had been locked up in a back room of the ist Precinct station house . We searched . We shouted . He shouted , too ; faintly . We were obliged to break locks . To jimmy open doers . All this in the disturbing presence of dead policemen slumped over desks or fallenp198to the floor . One fat sergeant embraced a water cooler . Behind bars , we could see the prisoners as they sat or lay on their bunks . Many looked to be alive . None of the faces betrayed any sign of pain . Some looked surprised . But then death had made no appointment . In most cases , the eyes were open ; and seemed still to see . As the door to Giles 's cell swung open , he shouted , " We 've won ! " Giles embraced each of us . Then he kissed Kalki 's hand , murmuring , " Namah Shivayah . " Giles looked haggard . He was full of complaints . " Do you realize that they did n't even give me time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ narrow cheeks . " Fascists . No , really . They are . And you know that I never use that word lightly . " Giles carefully combed his fringe of hair . " They would n't let me bring so much as a toothbrush . But , " he turned to Kalki , " they did let me watch you on television . I saw you dance , Lord . " How did Kalki respond ? Not at all . Other than an air of mission accomplished , he seemed perfectly unimpressed by what he had done . But Lakshmi and Geraldine were subdued , awed . Later Geraldine said that all she could think of at the time was Robert Oppenheimer 's description of the detonation of the first atomic bomb at Los Alamos . As the atom broke and the light flared and the mushroom cloud raped the sky , Oppenheimer wrote that no words could express his horror except the Hindu text : " I am Siva , the Destroyer of Worlds . " In a way , Oppenheimer was prescient . Myself ? Trapped in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could not comprehend the unthinkablethat Kalki , alone of all men , had thought . Later , I was to wake up . When I did , I found that I had blotted out much that would have been unbearable . There are mostly blank pages in my mental album marked The End . But I recall the rescue of Giles . I recall , vividly , the drive uptown from the police station . Kalki was at the wheel of a Call-a-Ride limousinethat he had commandeered in Battery Park . I sat beside him in the front seat . The others were in back . I do n't know why Lakshmi did n't sit beside her husband ; or why I did . Everywhere , stalled cars , buses , trucks . Many of the drivers had died at the wheel . Out of control , cars had crashed into one another , driven up onto sidewalks , into glass showrooms . Since the city 's traffic had stopped during the noon rush hour , Fifth Avenue was an obstaclep199course that Kalki managed , skillfully , to navigate . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overwhelmed . While driving , walking , talking , eating , four billion or so bodies had been unceremoniously dropped by their owners . They had fallen to earth in the most extraordinary attitudes . As we drove , nothing moved except the paper lotuses . Whenever the wind blew , they floated through the air , down silent streets . On the drive uptown , only Kalki took for granted the sights that we saw , the sounds that we did not hear . The traffic lights continued to blink for an hour or so . Kalki went through green lights and through red . I was conscious of his body next to mine . The sweat from the dance had dried . I noted in addition to familiar sandalwood and blondness , an acrid odor totally unlike Kalki . . . Siva ? We parked in front of the Sherry-Netherland Hotel , across Fifth Avenue from the Plaza Hotel . I wondered if Senator White was still in his corner suite . As we got out of the limousine , smoke began to curl languorously from the main door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . From one end of the city to the other , untended kitchens had caught fire . But the fires did little damage , thanks to a series of torrential rainstorms . Kalki suggested that we take rooms on the third floor because " when the electricity goes off , the elevators wo n't run and who wants to walk up and down twenty flights of steps a day ? " I did not mention that I would have been happy to put a thousand stairs between me and those decomposing bodies . But I joined the others on the third floor . During the three months that we lived in the Sherry-Netherland , I used up a thousand aerosol cans of floral spray . Whenever I went outside , I wore a gas mask , courtesy New York City Fire Department . In April we left the city only once . Lakshmi wanted to free the animals in the various zoos . So I flew her and Geraldine from city to city ; helped them open the cages ; let all the animals go , even the predators . Reptiles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Geraldine was firm , and reluctantly Lakshmi gave way . I was spaced out . The zoos . The hungry frightened animals . The smoldering fires . The pervading smell of smoke , of putrefying flesh . The flies . The silence . Except for that one trip , we seldom left the hotel , much less Newp200York City . Obviously we were waiting . But I did not ask for what . I asked no questions at all those first weeks . I did what I was told to do . Took Valium . Was a blank . At night , we ate communally . Giles was a good cook . Lakshmi helped him in the kitchen while Geraldine set the table . No one cleaned up . All the dishes in the world were now available to us . We took turns " shopping . " Fresh fruit and vegetables went bad almost immediately , but there was every sort of tinned or bottled or preserved food . We lived on ham , sausage , bacon . From time to time one of us would drive out to Long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any choice in the matter , I would have stayed in the countryside , where I was able to take off the gas mask and breathe fresh air . But I had no choice . What happened ? I had not a clue until our first dinner party at the Sherry-Netherland . This must have been a week after The End . I remember how taken aback I was when Lakshmi proposed " a dinner party . " She was festive . I was not . But then I was completely narcotized . I no longer dreamt at night . Nor , properly speaking , was I ever awake . Not only did I not understand what had happened , I was by no means certain that it had happened . I did not rule out the possibility of a long and elaborate nightmare . Yet I got up each morning . Did whatever had to be done . Then I made the rounds of nearby apartments and private houses , freeing trapped pets . But after the third week , there was no point to that . Each time I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chickens , pigs , ducks . . . whatever I could . I do n't suppose any of them survived the winter but my conscience was clear . . . clearer . The second day , Kalki and Giles had got a pickup truck and drove out to New Jersey where they liberated a cow and took her back to Central Park . Kalki milked the cow every day . But the milk was disappointingly thin . I preferred condensed milk . So did Giles . He made a splendid beef Stroganoff with condensed milk to celebrate our ( victory ? ) dinner . Lakshmi set the table . I lit candles . Giles kept promising to go to the main office of Con Edison and figure out how to light our section of the city with whatever fuel was still in the pipeline . But he never got around to it . I lit the candles . Geraldine arranged the fresh lotuses that I hadp201found in a Madison Avenue florist 's shop . Giles cooked at a gas stove in Kalki and Lakshmi 's " Imperial Suite . " Giles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had chosen a single , rather uncomfortableroom in the back . Saving money ? Indian costume had been abandoned . Lakshmi and Geraldine were both elegantly turned out . The result of hours spent across the street at Bergdorf Goodman 's . Eventually , out of need , I made a visit to Saks where I hurriedly assembled a number of unattractive odds and ends . Why unattractive ? I do n't know . I suppose that I did n't want to take advantage of our situation on the ground that , untaken advantage of , whatever that situation was it might be tempted to go away . Everyone now ate meat . I noted all this without comment . I assumed that whenever they wanted me to know the new rules to whatever game they were playing , they would tell me . Kalki mixed Sazeracs . Somehow he had got the impression that I liked them when I was in New Orleans . I had not . Do not . Despite or because of the Valium and the Sazeracs , I was , if not festive , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ End . The others were in their very own seventh heaven . Kalki wore a denim suit ; a flowing tie . Geraldine and Lakshmi were in evening gowns . Giles had found a tuxedo for himself , a size too large . Sitting beneath chandeliers fitted out with real candles ( my contribution ) , observing our reflections in tall gold mirrors and drinking potent Sazeracs , I had a sense of lunatic well-being . Was glad that I was not one of the billions outside that suite , rapidly approaching maximum entropy . We talked of clothes . Yes , clothes . Even Kalki had opinions . I listened . Narrowed my eyes so that the others became flickering amber blurs in the candlelight . For a moment , I had a sense that we had slipped , somehow , back into another century . The eighteenth . Soon Mozart would play . Voltaire would talk . I would practice my French , and never once dream of the twentieth century , the last century .. the horrors . We talked of food . Of travel . Kalki turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A blue-gold blur . " You 'll he traveling soon , " he said . " Where ? " I asked . " When ? " " June . July . As soon as the streets are a hit cleaner . " That was hutting it nicely , I thought " To Europe , " said Geraldine . " And I 'm coming , too . My first trip . " " I 'll be joining you , too , " said Giles . " Europe . Africa . Asia . Whereverthe kiss of Siva was bestowed . " " Yes . " I let the monosyllable drop like a stone into their conspiratorialchatter . They stopped talking . Looked at one another . I could tell that I had been discussed at length . Should Teddy know or not ? It was Geraldine who inducted me , finally , into Perfect Masterhood . " We 've been unfair , " she said to the others as well as to me . " Yes . " I let the monosyllable drop a second time . I felt more than usually unreal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what hap-pened . " " I do n't think so . " Giles looked at Kalki who was looking at me . Kalki 's expression was what was known to certain writers no longer with us as quizzical ( origin , according to the OED , " obscure " ) . " Well , " said Geraldine , somewhat unexpectedly , " you did it , Teddy . " " I did what ? " I looked at Kalki . He gave me a friendly smile . Blondnessunfurled in the golden light like a medieval flag . But Kalki did not speak . It was Giles who proclaimed , " You , Teddy Ottinger , delivered the kiss of Siva to the world . " I looked into the mirror opposite to see if my face was suitably blank . The mirror reported not blankness but anxiety . " How ? " I asked ; but knew the answer . " The lotuses , " said Geraldine . " You dropped more than seventy million . They did the job . " Giles stood up . Crossed to the dining room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cooking and explaining . " Those paper flowers , " said Giles , " had been saturated with bacteria that are instantly fatal to human beings as well as to certain but not all of our monkey cousins . Other mammals , fowl and saurians are unaffected by this bacterium or plague or kiss of Siva which is known to your friendly neighborhood pathologist as Yersinia entercolitica . " Giles sniffed . The odor of beef Stroganoff was in the air . It was ready . Giles raced through his lecture . " Ordinary or garden variety Yersinia is deadly but not invariably so . It is also not instant , not total . During the Vietnam war the American army 's clandestine chemical warfare division was able to isolate a pecu/liarly virulent strain capable of ending all human life on earth . This discovery was not only an enormous feather in the cap of the American army 's clandestine chemical warfare unit but a triumph for the man who actually developed it , Sergeant J.J. Kelly . " Giles bolted into the kitchen . Lakshmi put her hand on Kalki @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Medal . " She looked proud . " In fact , Jimmy was the only noncommissioned officer in all of chemical warfare to get such a high decoration . " This was , by the way , the first time that Lakshmi ever called Kalki Jimmy in our presence . " The research was fascinating . " Kalki was suddenly alert . We all were . But then the one ( the only ? ) thing that the five of us had in common was a fascination with the technical , the theoretical , the empirical . It is no accident that we are who we are . " Just outside Saigon , " said Kalki , " the army had this dream setup . A first-rate lab . First-rate personnel . Naturally , the whole thing was top-secret because our army was n't supposed to be into bacteriological warfare but of course we were . Anyway , in less than six months , I was able to isolate my own mega-variation of Yersinia . " I had a picture of Kalki wandering about the world with a bottle full of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kalki was amused . " No . I did n't keep the original strain . I did n't have to . Since I already knew the process of isolation , I re-created the bacteria in Katmandu . " " We did n't need much , " said Lakshmi . " Six ounces was all . " " Six grams , " Kalki corrected her . " But that was easy . The tricky part was , first , achieving the right dilution . Then the impregnation of the paper lotuses . That was a real headache . I had to do most of it myself in a lab on the Narayana . Giles did what he could . But he 's not very good with his hands . " Geraldine made a gesture , as if to bestow on me a medal or a rose . " But the greatest problem was delivery . You handled that , Teddy . Without knowing it , of course . " " None of this would have been possible without you , Teddy . " Lakshmi was , gravely , loving . I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world did not receive , simultaneously , the blessing of Siva , the age of Kali would not have ended all at once but gradually . " ' That was the toughest pa-t of all , " said Kalki " The instant that **28;5567;TOOLONG he lasted out the day , shook the humble hand , congratulated the scholarship winner , conferred about strategy for the next election over a lunch that he even noticed dimly was excellent , coped with assorted desk business , kept a drumheid affability stretched across his face . At seventeen hundred hours he called Alice to say he would n't be home that evening either . " Working late , may be all night , " he explained . " Yes , " she said tonelessly . Her look pains me . I am a compassionate man . " Truth , " he said . " Call me back later if you do n't believe it . " " Why ? " she sighed . He frowned . " Are you getting depressed again , dear ? I 've told you over and over that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot , you should n't stay in the house and mope . You need to develop outside interests , activities  --  " " You told me not to join the Galaxy Club , they 're too much a pressure group for interstellar exploration . I was loyal and did n't . Now I 've reached my limit of things you do want me to belong to . " " Hey , let 's not start fighting . " " Oh , no . My problem is I love you . " Her voice still sounded flat and tired . " And the kids . I think they need some protection I can give them . Have you ever speculated what kind of love relationships the Others have ? " Pricked , he snapped , " I 've heard fifty thousand speculations about everything conceivable concerning the damned Others  --  and claims of contact , creeds , crankeries , bad songs , worse writings , never a bloody thing constructive , never anything but avoidance of our proper human busi-ness . " " Goodnight , Ira , " she said and broke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God , give me strength , if You exist , " he declaimed , " and if You do n't , do it anyway , huh ? " Preparations soothed him a trifle , as they might a dog turning around before lying down in the grass . This was n't his first vigil here , and the place was equipped for it . In theory he could manage everything from his house . In practice that required interconnections  --  for example , to special data systems  --  which would be expensive to install and imperfectly secure . He sent out for dinner , made the couch into a bed , loosened his clothes , settled full length in the embrace of a lounger , and considered what entertainment to screen . Maybe a classic book he 'd always meant to read or a classic show he 'd always meant to see ? No , he was too tightly wound . Either mindless relaxation or else an affirmation , playing back one of the noble speeches by the founders of the Party  --  or , wait , why not a couple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possibly find details to improve ? He reached for the retrieval control . His phone chimed . He was halfway out of the lounger before he had brought himself back down into calm . And still he sweated and shivered underneath . " I 've finally heard , " Palamas said . Background indicated she was calling from her apartment or whatever it was . " They appear to have located Chinook , approaching the Wheel from the far side . " Brodersen , may his figurative soul burn forever in mythical hell , guessed  --  " What precisely is your information , please ? " According to her answer , the probability looked high . A metallic object of about the right size had been detected at the edge of the forbidden zone . It was inbound , currently under low acceleration or none . A couple of days earlier , a Solar weather monitor had happened to record a jet trail outbound along what would be an appropriate path . The facts all pointed to Chinook 's having made for the vicinity of the San Geronimo Wheel , coasting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aimed sunward again , coasting once more ( for a better look ) , presumably soon to accelerate for Earth at a full gee and arrive with whatever yarn her crew had concocted . No , arrive with a broadcast that thousands of receivers will pick up , as soon as she 's in range . " I expect we can reach her , " Palamas said . " Lasers might miss , but if her radio is open as regulations require , she ought to hear a strong signal . " " No  --  I mean , hold on . " Quick marshalled words . " I do appreciate your efforts , Miz Palamas , and wo n't forget them . But this matter is more critical than I 'm free to tell you . I 'm afraid I must call further on your patience . " He leaned nearer the pickup . " This has to be done as secretly as possible , " he said . " Nothing must leak to the news media , not a hint , not a whisper . Basically , I 'm invoking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That spaceship will be ordered to head straight for the T machine and return to the Phoebean System , maintaining outercom silence , under the severest penalties for noncompliance . " Do you understand me , Miz Palamas ? The severest penalties . You and I have a long night 's work ahead of us . I have to notify the appropriate people , confer with them , get the arrangements made . You have to call your superiors , refer them to me , take for granted that their consent will be forthcoming while you start space units scrambling to enforce my order . Do you read me well , Miz Palamas ? " " I .. . think I do ... Mr. Minister . "  | " Good . " Quick flashed a taut smile . " I repeat , your service in this emergency will riot be forgotten . Now let 's take a few minutes to discuss exactly what all this means and how we can best operate . " She was middle-aged and dumpy ; a check during the day had revealed she was placidly married @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Quick had gotten eager cooperation out of harder cases than that . The fear in him began to melt . Brodersen 8c Co. were fugitives from the law on Demeter , accused of conspiracy against public order . He had the warrants that said so . He also  --  given support in the right quarters  --  had authority to dispatch them back through the gate , incommunicado , subject to a nuclear warhead at the slightest sign of rebellion . Meanwhile he 'd alert Aurie and she could prepare to take them in charge . The details and contingencies were endless , of course . For instance , no vessel was anywhere near the Wheel except for Chinook herself and empty Emissary . Brodersen might attempt something desperate . No matter how smoothly the business went , Ira Quick had no limit of work to do , and afterward no limit of trail-covering and explaining away . He would need strong help , yes , on the highest level . Moreover , this crisis made him see with full clarity that he and his fellows had stalled too long , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her personnel . The time was overpast to act , for the sake of humanity . That knowledge was unexpectedly exhilarating . Quick practiced a fighting grin . By heaven , Brodersen , he thought , I 've got you corraled , I 'm about to saddle and mount and break you ... but thanks for the challenge !  |p153WHEN  THE DIRECTIVE reached Chinook , her captain 's first response was to issue a command of his own : " Cut the engine ; five-minute phasedown . " A siren hooted warning . Crewfolk hastened to secure loose objects and find handholds for themselves . Meanwhile thrust dropped steadily until the ship fell free , under no acceleration save that of the distance-dwindled sun toward which she was bound . Caitlin arrowed from their apartment into the office where Brodersen was . She had quickly and gleefully mastered weightless motion . Trouble could not altogether sober away from her face and body the joy of flying . The slim , coverall-clad form shot through the doorway between , banked off two successive bulkheads with a hand and a foot , reached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came to a halt with an effort that sent blood surging to cheeks and bronze locks tumbling about them , and , floating , stretched across to plant a kiss on the man 's mouth . " Easy , hey , easy , " he said . His own massive frame sat buckled into a chair . " We got a decision or three to make , fast . " She turned grave . " What is it hauled you in here ? " " That call from Stef , " he said unnecessarily . The mate , on watch in the command center , had received the message and summoned Brodersen to the private line . " You 've thunder on your brow . What 's wrong , my life ? " " You 'll hear when the rest do . " His arm brushed her and nearly tore her loose as he reached for the intercom switch . Temper flared . She reached to slap back at him . " Would you be shoving me about like a dead thing ? " " Damnation , " he half snapped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forp154the Wheel , andevery second we 're a couple of hundred kilometers closer to passing by it . " Instantly contrite , she did not waste time apologizing , but stroked fingersacross his head . " Captain to crew , " he declaimed . " Attention . We 've received word from Earth  --  long-range ' cast , and they must 've gone to a lot of trouble to locate and identify us . It 's got a government call sign . We 're wanted on Demeter on , quote , grave charges of conspiracy against public order and safety . ' We 're to proceed straight to the T machine . No , not quite straight . They specify the flight parameters . We 'll come nowhere near enough to anyplace to make our announcement , with the outercom equipment we 've got . Besides , we 're forbidden to speak anybody , except an official vessel that contacts us first . We 're warned that watchships have been assigned to enforce all this by , quote , the strictest means appropriate . ' The writ is in the name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and invokes nothing less than full emergency powers . " He drew breath . " In short , brethren and sisters , the enemy is onto our game , faster'n I feared , and we 're ticketed for the same oblivion that Emissary is in , or worse . What to do about it ? " " Jesus , Mary , and Joseph ! " had burst from Caitlin before she steadied herself , clung white-knuckled to the bar , and regarded him through eyes gone emerald-hard . A babble came over the intercom . " Quiet ! " Brodersen shouted . When he had it , he said : " Either we go along like good little taxpayers or we take counteraction of some kind . But counteraction will have to start right away , I imagine . That 's how come I stopped thrust . Which do n't gain us much time , though . Think fast , people . " " We should be meeting together , the way we are not only voices to each other , " Caitlin protested . " Yeah , but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be cutting it the while , aye , and aiming toward that Wheel of infamy ? If we do decide to be meek after all , then they 'll not know on Earth what we did beforehand , will they , now ? " " By God , you may be right . Hold on , everybody . " Brodersen tugged his chin as he reflected aloud . " Let 's see ... killing our present vector and applying one for rendezvous . . . yeah , I 'd guesstimate we can maneuver for two-three hours before radars that 're a.u. distant from us can spot the difference . .. finite signal speed , large probable error .. . and besides , the way we 're supposed to go lies in that general direction  --  Yes ! " He slapped his desktop , a gunshot noise and a violent countermotion of his harnessed body . " I 'll bet my left ball against your virginity , Pegeen , we can lay ap155course clear to the Wheel , such that none of ' em yonder , no closer than the orbit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the path they want us in . " His tone approached a roar : " Stef and Phil ! Start us braking . Half a gee . That wo n't commit us beyond redemption in a couple of hours . " " Had we not best beam a message to Earth at once , to say we will obey ? " Zarubayev asked . " Sure , sure , " Brodersen agreed . " The order specifies the form of our reply . Nothing but the number one-oh-one , addressed to a particular Astro Board official but with no identification of us . They really are leaning into the secrecy , are n't they ? Okay , Stef , put it out on the laser . " Su , " he went on , " do you savvy what this is about ? Before we can plan , we need more facts . Hook yourself up and compute if we can reach the Wheel while looking , from the inner System , as if we 're just angling toward the prescribed track . That is , how long might we reasonably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which may be fingering us , but do n't forget to figure in how much the radar disc of the Wheel may be enlarged by its radiation shield . Can do ? " " Wiz probability only . " Granville 's reply was cooler than anyone would have awaited who did not know her well . " No guarantee . " " Shucks , all we ever do in this universe is play odds . How long will you need ? " " ' Alf an hour , per'aps , mostly for to search out the data . " " " Good . If your answer is positive , we 'll start boosting whichever way you figure is optimum for getting to the Wheel unbeknownst . Then we 'll meet in the common room and wrangle . I favor a rescue operation for the Emissary people . You may disagree , " Brodersen told his crew at large . " Put your arguments together while you wait . Think hard . Pray for guidance , if you 're so inclined ... but think ! " Afterward , in his mind , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which were scattered in fragments , spoken into each other 's mouths , disorganized as words always are when several human beings try to reason together  --  but a kind of synopsis , an attempt to frame the different spirits wherein they left the gathering . Sergei Zarubayev , glacier-practical : " What choice has the cabal left itself except to kill us ? " Stefan Dozsa , roughly , his fist punishing his knee : " And they will continue in the government . They may well become the government . So it goes from despotism to tyranny . "  |p156Phili|p  Weisenberg , ashiver with emotion he seldom showed : " This looks like ourfirst chance , man 's first chance , to find the Others . Will we let it be the last ? " Martti Leino , furious : " Nol God damn you , Daniel Brodersen , have n't you gotten the family you 're supposed to be responsible for in enough trouble already ? "  --  but later he yielded , sullenly , in part because he was alone , in part because Dozsa gibed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mulryan , aloud and ablaze : " What do you mean , saying I must stay inboard whilst you make your raid ? I 'll have you know  --  " and she too needed calming down before she gave reluctant consent to his tactics . Susanne Granville , softly : " Why would I'ave come along , my captain , if not to follow you ? " Himself : " Maybe I overplayed my hand , making for here . I do honestly think not . I did underestimate the opposition  --  mainly , I suppose , Aurie Hancock . But it stands to reason they'd 've acted as fast and decisively if we 'd gone straight to Earth ; and we'd 've had far less room for maneuver ; and for sure we 'd not have the evidence we do , that Emissary is back . " Well , ' twill be mighty easy to send her off toward Sirius , manned by the corpses of her crew , and not much harder to dispose of us . I 'm not saying this will happen , but I am saying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idle under such a risk ? " If we can snake Langendijk 's band out of yon jail  --  I 'm personally convinced it is a jail  --  What then ? ' you ask . I do n't know , except that then we 've got the real clinching proof . The pictures we 've taken of Emissary through the scanners we might have faked , but how can we have faked the people ? And , you know , they may have picked up some useful capabilities wherever they 've been . " We must n't count on that , of course . I 've developed a couple of alternative battle plans which I 'd like to sketch out for you . They 're strictly tentative . We 'll have to see how the bones roll . We 're not playing poker any more , you realize , we 're shooting craps . " If you accept my notions , I 'll next have to try and find out if there is any possibility of us pulling off a whizzer at the Wheel . Maybe there is n't . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little retailoring , and Brodersen was attired like a rear admiral in the space corps of the Peace Command . Alone in the command center , he waited for the outercom to establish contact for him.  |p157Silence  enfolded his head , somehow deepened by the low weight which settled him in his chair . He heard the breath in his nostrils , felt the collar at his throat . Stars glistered multitudinous in the screens , the Milky WayI gleamed around its lanes of darkness , the Solar disc stood pharaonic between wings of light . High magnification in one display showed him his target , spokes and rim slowly turning as if to grind an unknown grist . The captive ship was not in that field and he did n't reset the scanner toward her , for he had seen and made a record ; he had seen . + Leino 's initial protest rose while he waited , to move spookily around within him . Have I the right ? I 'm committed now , but should I ever have begun ? It could be that Quick and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ha ! his rational and his willful selves responded together . Well , but should I have stayed home anyway ? the ghost wondered . Less on account of Lis , though she 's who Martti was thinking of , than Barbara and Mike . Their own dear fetches came to snuggle in his lap ; he could nearly feel the warmth and scent the gentle odor that only small childrenI have . It 's not as if Demeter wo n't be ample for their lifetimes . In fact , an opening to the galaxy ' ud mean all sorts of revolution , maybe good  --  I believe that but might be wrong  --  or maybe bad , but nothing for sure any longer ... the kind of surety their father ought to make for them .... He stiffened . Horse shit ! he flung forth for an exorcism . Must I tramp over this ground again ? The Union is n't stable , no country is , the real Jor-certain hell is brewing on Earth itself , and Demeter 's a hop through the sate from here . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , new knowledge , new ideas . The single thing it has n't got is absolute security . No part of it does . The closest we can come to that is through opportunity . Hoy , the buzzer . End of sermon , huh ? He pressed accept . The telescreen presented the image of a young man , in civilian garb but of disciplined bearing . Nonetheless , astonishment registered . Brodersen 's anxieties went down a notch . Obviously they 'd received no word at the Wheel . " Peace Command special mission , " he said . " Matthew Fry , admiral , commanding transport Chinook . " His pseudonym he borrowed fromitlin 's housesitter . As for his ship , a fictitious designation was Ynadvisable ; Reina-class craft were too few . About three seconds passed while light waves bore his statement across ce , plus reaction time at the far end , plus the time for a reply togive  --  eleven heartbeats ; Brodersen counted them , and at the back of his , ain felt pleased that they were no more . " Sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gulped . " We had no inkling anyone was anywhere near us . " Whatd reckoned on . Why should you keep a lookou  --  nd why should Quick notify you ? That might cause you to wonder a bit . Nor will his radars show if we go the whole way to you , because you 'll be occulting us for hours . I did fear that you might 've overheard the radio message to us . But again , you had no cause to be listening . Any communication to you will go on a nice economical laser beam , your orbit being exactly known . " You were n't supposed to have that information till now , " Brodersen said . " Connect me with your chief : sealed circuit . " Time . " Sir , he 's off duty , asleep . Can it wait ? " Brodersen had been alert for such a chance to learn more . He put on his martinet expression . " Insubordinate , are you ? " he barked . " State your service , rank , and name . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through a transmission lag like this . However , a top-deck PC officer was impressive , especially in space where he held almost life-and-death powers . " Pardon , sir ? I , yes , of course , I 'll buzz Colonel Troxell at once . " " I required your service , rank , and name . You will give them to me . " Time . He in the Wheel blanched and said helplessly : " North American secret service , Lieutenant Samuel Webster , sir . " So that 's who I 'm dealing with . Yeah , Quick 's North American . It figures . " You 'd better learn to snap to orders if you do n't want to get busted , Lieutenant Webster . Well , I wo n't put you on report . Get me the colonel . " Time . " Yes , sir ! Thank you , sir ! " More time passed , minutes . Brodersen wished his image allowed him to light his pipe . A burly man , hair hastily brushed and tunic hastily thrown on , appeared in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probed . " Admiral , uh , Fry ? Welcome , sir . You catch us unprepared , I 'm afraid , but we 'll do our best . " The closing of his lips which signified that he was through talking had a military snap . " Very good , " Brodersen said . " First , you will maintain total outercom silence except to this ship . If you happen to get a message , I want to know what it is and dictate your reply . I 'll give you the reason shortly . Second , I want to raise my acceleration to a gee , which will let me dock at the Wheel in five or six hours . Is that feasible ? " Time . " Well .. . yes ... but  --  Admiral , as a routine matter I 'd like to see your orders . " Not unexpected . " Will you transmit me yours , Colonel ? "  |p159Time  . " What ? Pardon . Kindly explain . " Brodersen chuckled as he supposed Admiral Fry would . " You 're operating under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noted for passing confidential documents around carelessly . Neither is the Peace Command . We 'll put both our Omega spools in your reader when I arrive , and compare . " Scanning for transmission would automatically wipe the encoded information . Time . " Your mission 's really that secret ? " " Since it relates to yours , yes . Colonel , brace yourself . You 've been guarding the members of the Emissary expedition . Are you ready to add a follow-up load of nonhumans ? " The effect was as powerful as Brodersen had hoped . ( Otherwise he might have turned tail then and there and tried to convey his news to another spacecraft or two , an isolated asteroid base or two , before the watchships hunted him down  --  poor though the chances were that that would do any good . ) Troxell 's doubts vanished . They had been feeble from the outset , for he had no grounds for suspecting that anybody outside the government and the Faraday crew had any intimation of the facts . Still , Brodersen must work warily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , holding two pair , was seeking to bluff out a full house . Pretending to knowledge he did not possess , he must get it from Troxell under guise of telling his own story . As for that : After Emissary returned , the PC had planted an extra guard on the Phoebean T machine . A strange vessel did emerge . She was boarded and her crew made prisoners without resistance . Having already leased Chehalis ' well-equipped but idle exploratory ship , the PC took them and their essentials away for safekeeping . To forestall any speculations , Fry declared when he entered the Solar System that his destination was Vesta , and went spaceward of his true goal before doubling back toward it . Troxell believed . No fool , he nevertheless was predisposed to believe . Brodersen had anticipated that . The warders of the Wheel  --  twenty-one total , as he learned by feigning a slight misunderstanding  --  must be of more or less Actionist ideology . Else Quick , studying dossiers , doubtless getting depth-psych examinations made of volunteers " for a confidential assignment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Soon Troxell was eager to talk . He needed to justify himself , he who had been penned in for these many weeks with his prisoners who were also his accusers . Brodersen listened patiently , encouragingly to all the antistellar theses . For a minute he was tempted to deny that the detention was proper , an act decided upon by the Council . But no . A few sentences ca n't overturn a man 's faith.  |p160Meanwhile  Ms heart slammed , skin chilled and tingled , soul hallooed , behind a hard-held calm  --  for in between chunks of the lecture , he caught mentions of truth . The Emissary crew had been eight years at the far end of their gate . They had lost three members . Carlos and Joelle were alive . They maintained the aliens were friendly and anxious to begin cultural exchange . They had an alien with them . They had an alien with them . Brodersen could hit on no safe way to find out what the creature looked like . He gathered that it could live under Terrestrial conditions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sole representative its race would send unless mankind freely chose to establish relations  --  " And later they dispatched a ship of their own regardless , huh ? " Troxell said . " How dumb do they suppose we are ? " " Well , they may have found reasons to change their minds , " Brodersen temporized . " It has to be investigated , and you 've got the only people with experience of them . " Besides , maybe more important , the Council has decided that we must have far better intelligence of them before we can allow anything to happen . I hope our arresting this group will drive the point home and we wo n't need to take more drastic measures . You well realize , Colonel , we ca n't have public hysteria either . Hence the secrecy . " Time . " Yes , of course , Admiral Fry , no argument . Let 's discuss arrangements , shall we ? What precautions have you in mind ? "  --  Eventually the conference ended . Full Earth weight had resumed as Chinook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to notice . When outside communication went on standby , the crew became free to load the intercom with jabber . Brodersen knew he must get them properly organized . The venture would be precarious at best . He stood up , stretched and eased , stretched and eased , till the hardest knots were out of his muscles . Hell take hurry , he decided . Oh , I 'll brief them and drill them as well as I can . But that 's not awfully well ; wo n't fill more than an hour or two . First we should rest . First I will go back to Pegeen . It could be our last while together.  |p161ON  DELICATE THRUSTS of her auxiliary motors , Chinook aligned herself with the open hub of the Wheel . Flame-tinged vapors gushed across night and dissipated . That made possible a rapid bleedoff of the enormous electrostatic potential which shielded her against cosmic rays . When she was well positioned , gliding in on a carefully monitored trajectory , a gyro within her began to turn . Her hull gathered spin until it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was quite near . Her people sat still to avoid motion sickness from radial weight variationsand Coriolis force . Brodersen drew comfort from the steady tones of the control officer ahead . His cover yarn accounted for Chinook 's absence of insignia other than a registry number and his flamboyant company etnblem , as well as the presence of an energy gun turret counterbalanced by a missile tube . Just the same , they might have grown suspicious  --  perhaps on Earth , to send a warning hither at the speed of light . But evidently not . ! Its heart slugged , though , his jaws ached from being clenched , sweat trickled cold along his ribs and reeked . More than a quarter of a Terrestrial century had gone by since last he was in combat . The spaceship drifted into the hub at a few meters per second . She was very little off center . ( That had better be the case . A vessel her size had scant clearance . ) Arms extended from the cylinder wall . Soft-surfaced roller bearings upon them brought Chinook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , stern and focusing tubes out the rear . Her spin became identical with that of her surroundings at the instant when her main personnel and cargo locks were opposite the correct entry ports . This caused the Wheel to gain angular momentum , but the change was minuscule . After a sufficient number of dockings had significantly affected rotation , a jet in the rim would reduce it.  |p162Since  this visitor had no freight to discharge , only a gangtube reached forth to osculate the exit for the crew . A reserve tank filled it with air . Equalized pressure activated a sensor which flashed a green light and beeped . You may come on through . Brodersen ran wooden tongue over sandy lips . Yet otherwise , as of old , he was abruptly cool , too busy to be nervous . " Okay , " he told his men . " Remember our doctrine and signals . " He blew a kiss to Caitlin , who stood behind them , a submachine gun in her clasp . Susanne was elsewhere , linked to her computer and , through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to any command she gave . Limited input restricted her to a few basic actions , but Brodersen was glad of even that much backup . Caitlin touched lips to the muzzle of her weapon and dipped it in his direction . He turned from the glory of her . " Good luck , " he wished all his folk , and went ahead . Centrifugal force , equal to about one-tenth gee , put the airlock under him , but the airlock contained rungs . Beyond its outer valve , the gangtube offered him another set , closely spaced because it was accordion-folded to minimum length . Fluorolight cast odd shadows among the pleats . He bounded down . Low-weight had a magic of its own . Emerging , he took a short fixed ladder to a balcony-like platform intended to help the unloading of baggage . Thence a second ladder went to the deck ; but he stopped where he was and looked . This was the moment before he charged or fled . Five meters high , a broad corridor arched out of sight on either hand , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along it which shut off disused facilities . A hatchway led to a spoke , passageway to the rim . The hall was drably painted and carpeted ; the draft from ventilator grilles came loud , with a faint smell of oil , a sign of recent neglect . Men clustered beneath him . Save for Troxell , who was in business tunic and slacks , they wore coveralls . Each had a holstered sidearm : slugthrower , not stunner . Brodersen counted . Twenty-one . A measure of optimism lifted in him . The stunt 's worked so far . They 're here , the lot of them , including the communications and control officers , maintenance technies , quartermasterIt was what he had gotten the colonel to agree to . Lock his present captives in the auditorium . ( Brodersen had ascertained where it was located . ) Bring his entire following to meet the newcomers and help them escort the nonhumans ( who might conceivably use nonhuman capabilities in attempting a break ) to a safe place . " Greeting , sir , " Troxell called in English @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Everything in order ? "  | " Aye , " Brodersen said . " Come on down . " " Wait a minute . I want a man at my back . " " Huh ? " " Ca n't be too cautious , can we ? Very well , Sergei . " Zarubayev appeared , bearing a tommy gun . He sprang to join his aptain . The agents showed surprise . Bearded , long-haired , dressed like them , the Russian jarred on their expectations . Here we go . Brodersen whipped forth his pistol . Zarubayev 's gun swept downward . " Not a move ! " Brodersen shouted . " Hands up before we shoot ! " " What the hell  --  " Troxell 's roar cut off when Zarubayev 's weapon c 1iattered . The warning burst whanged nastily off the opposite bulkhead . The warders froze . " Hands on heads , " Brodersen commanded . " Quick !  --  Okay , boys , come on through . " Weisenberg and Leino joined him . They bore automatic rifles , and bundled on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are and nobody will get hurt , " Brodersen said . " But whoeveracts funny will die . Is that clear ? He will die . " Inwardly he begged that that not happen . Those fellows were doing naught but their job . He 'd encountered some like them , though , when he truly wore the uniform of the Union , whom he 'd helped kill . The commitments on either side had been irreconcilable . His glance flicked right and left . Zarubayev was smiling , as if he enjoyed this . Maybe he did . Weisenberg stood tense , his mouth stretched out of shape , though his piece never wavered . Leino 's face was wet and strained , helmeted in dank hair , and he breathed hard , but he did n't seem frightened either . And me , well , they used to call me the Great Stone Phiz , Brodersen remembered . Back at the airlock , Dozsa and Caitlin were his reserves , guarding a line of retreat . He wondered how they looked . It was no picnic carrying out a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thoughtfully as might be . Zarubayev , though Demeter born , had grown restless and siant a few years in the PC , interplanetary corps , before he went to work for Chehalis ; he 'd seen no fighting but had gotten plenty of drill and maneuver . Leino , raised in the wilderness , was a champion marksman . Weisenberg could make any tool a part of his body , and a weapon is a tool . All three had ample space experience . Dozsa did too , but not with arms and seldom outside a ship . Pegeen-Yes , I did what I could in the time that I had . Whether I gauged well , we 're about to learn.  |p164Rage  racked Troxell 's visage . " Are you crazy ? " he yelled . " What is this piracy ? Do you imagine you can get away clear , you sons o ' bitches , you  --  " He choked . " Take it easy , " Brodersen answered . " I told you we mean no harm unless you force us . Listen . Our aim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detained under false pretenses . You 've been hoodwinked . Ira Quick is a crook , and you 'll see him on trial before long . " " Prove it ! " an agent challenged . Brodersen shook his head . " As Antony told Cleopatra , I am not prone to argue . The newscasts will inform you . Today you 'll follow orders . " Move over there , by that door marked 14 . " He pointed . It was well clear of the spoke entrance . " Bunch together . I want you in easy range of this guy . " He jerked a thumb at Zarubayev . " He 'll watch you while the rest of us go spring the prisoners . Then we 'll disarm you and lock you up . We 'll leave you a hand drill or a hammer and chisel or whatever we figure you can use to break free in an hour or two , after we 're gone . Do you understand ? We 'd hate to harm anybody . We 're not bandits , we 're trying to set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yourselves under citizen 's arrest , obey us , and everything will be fine . But I repeat , we 'll shoot if we must . " Move ! Keep those hands on your scalps . Move ! " They shuffled from him . He was aware of the scuff , of panting and trembling and muttered maledictions , of sweat and glares . " Stop , " he cried . To Leino and Weisenberg : " Proceed . " They ignored the ladder and jumped , falling like autumn leaves . He followed . The impact was light in feet and knees . The hatch was two bounds off . It stood open . Brodersen waved his partners through . When they were gone , his free hand grabbed a rail , he swung himself into the companionway . A pistol crack whipped him to a halt . Twice . Thrice . It stabbed his eardrums . He twisted about where he stood . The bunch of agents was breaking up like a glob of dropped mercury . Men scampered off or flopped to the deck , drew their guns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of bodies below crumpled , then he reeled back . Blood spouted from his neck and belly . Brodersen blazed into the foe . Through him there flashed : A fanatic , a devotee , a hero . .. must 've hunkered down a bit when two or three others hid him ... yanked his rod out and let fly ... knowing he 'd almost surely miss , but he 'd trigger a fusillade  --  I 'll never know who it wasHe heard Troxell bellow , saw the survivors retreat , when Dozsa reached the platform , crouched above Zarubayev , and sprayed the corridor withp165metal . It wailed as it ricocheted , through the rattle of explosions . Troxell 's party disappeared up the curvature of this world . He wo n't continue a fire fight under these conditions . Pistols are too inaccurate , especially here ... low weight , Coriolis vectors , the sighting wrongTwo men sprawled dead , their shapes gone graceless , their features hideous . Three more were badly wounded . One dragged himself away , legs trailing , one stared at a shattered kneecap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going into shock . Zarubayev 's blood dripped off the platform , slow and scarlet , slow and scarlet . Dozsa snarled at the edge . Caitlin stood by him now , wild of countenance , cursing in a torrent , but swinging her weapon steadily back and forth . What Troxell will try to do is block us from freeing the prisoners . Brodersen 's paralysis broke . It had only lasted a few seconds . " Hold the fort ! " he shouted . " Keep well covered ! We 'll be back ! " He swarmed along a short circular staircase to the elevator . Weisenberg and Leino were there . The senior engineer had obviously had to restrain the junior from rushing up to join the battle , which would have been useless or worse . They were still wrestling . " Let 's go , " Brodersen said , and pushed the button for it . The elevator was little more than a steel slab at right angles to a belt which carried it . Three more served the same passageway . Between them , easy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resting places . Those were for emergency use . The shaft extended almost nine hundred meters . Staring into its bleakly illuminated depths , Brodersen saw it converge in perspective on an atom-small terminus , and dizziness touched him . Weisenberg sagged down onto a bench and stared at the floor . " Eli , Eli , " he mumbled , " that this had to be . " Leino , on his feet , gripped the rail as if to crumple it and shook his rifle aloft . His Upland speech came raw : " They fell on their own deeds , they swinehounds . " " We 're not done with them yet . " Brodersen 's response was mechanical . Most of him howled , l led Pegeen into this , Pegeen . " I feel sure they hope to catch us at the auditorium . " Weisenberg glanced up , instantly alert . " Can they ? " " Du n no . You heard what I managed to worm out of Troxell concerning the layout here . I did n't dare push too hard . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing crawls . " " It 's meant to , " Weisenberg told him . " Change of gravity and air pressure . You need time to adapt . Whichever the enemy takes wo n't be anyp166faster . And they retreated spinward from us . The auditorium is antispinward from here . We 'll have a slight jump on them . " " Yes , and just the three of us have them outgunned , " Brodersen added . " Sit yourself , Martti . Recover your strength . " He set an example , after choosing a rifle from Leino 's load , but his mind gave no cooperation . Pegeen . Lis . Barbara . Mike . The stars . Once as a boy , on a sail cruise through the San Juan Islands , he 'd developed a galloping earache . There was nothing to do but endure until the drum broke and relieved the satanic pain . That took a couple of hours . This five-minute ride felt longer . But then it ended . He led the way in a rush , up a stairwell which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred-odd meters he could see until curvature blocked vision , the corridor lifted before him like a ramp . Though he was never climbing while he pounded through its hollowness , Earth weight dragged at him . Breath surged rough in his gullet . A double door beneath a photomural , Armstrong on Luna  --  He 'd expected to shoot out the lock , but the fastening was a mere latch , a steel bar between two brackets that must have been hastily welded on after he called from space . He cast it loose and flung the portal wide . Ranked in their hundreds , seats confronted a stage as empty as they were . Nearby , the Emissary explorers rose in amazement . Most were sloppily clad , they blurred together for Brodersen as he sped toward them , until he saw Joelle  --  Judas priest , her hair is gray , she 's skinny , well , eight years  --  He saw the alien , chimerical cross between an otter , a lobster , a seal , a duck , a kangaroo , an alligator , a porpoise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could name , nothing his vision was ready for , a brown blur  --  " We 're springing you ! " he bawled . " We 're your friends ! We 're getting you out of here ! Joelle , do you know me ? " " Freedom , freedom , freedom ! " Leino chanted . A tall man stepped out of the group . Brodersen recognized Captain Langendijk . Weisenberg ran to meet him . Brodersen and Joelle stopped , stared , held out hands toward each other . Weisenberg and Langendijk halted . " This is a rescue , " the engineer said between gasps . " You 're unlawfully held  --  we 've come to set you free  --  make the truth known  --  we 've met resistance  --  may have to fight our way back to our ship  --  here , arm yourselves  --  " " Dan , " Joelle marveled . Her eyes were enormous , ebon , in the ivory face . He collected his wits . " Hurry along , " he wheezed , and caught her by thewrist . She in turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A man joined them . " Daniell " he exclaimed . " Por todos los Santos  --  "  |p167Carlos  Francisco Miguel Rueda Suarez . He had grown bald . A hefty blond woman followed . Brodersen recalled fleetingly the name 1.1 ieda von Moltke . The rest milled , bewildered . Brodersen started back up the aisle he was in . It would n't do to get blockaded . " Hurry , hurry ! " he shouted . Once beyond the doors , Weisenberg and ! . vino could pass out the stuff they carried . After that , let Troxell beware . Ills engineers were at Brodersen 's heels , yelling , waving . Still most of the . tptives dithered . Langendijk urged them on , but they were n't soldiers , nor ix ntnd by the heart to these wild invaders . Clamor and weapons roused an instinct to hide . They needed a few minutes for comprehension . Brodersen re-entered the corridor . His right hand gripped his rifle , his left Joelle . The alien tagged close behind her . Leino came immediately alter . Weisenberg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Von Moltke took the chance to work a tommy gun loose from the bundle on hislL back . Rueda Suarez started to do likewise . Down the bend of the deck came Troxell and his men . Their front rank carried by the legs a couple of large tables , tops facing forward  --  shields . Brodersen could never afterward quite remember what happened . A new Light erupted . He and those with him backed down the hall ; they zigzagged , they knelt , they dropped , they ran further , they kept shooting , and somehownone of them was hit . Somehow the enemy was gone when they trashed the next spoke . Ile guessed their fire had been too heavy , allowing pistols too little e fiance to be effective . Or the agents had run low on ammo . Or both . ' l toxell would have kept enough to hold trapped the Emissary people who 'd not moved out at once . A return to the auditorium would be suicide . Joelle shook Brodersen back to full awareness . " Listen , Dan , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Betan  --  the alien here ca n't eat our food . We have supplies for him . " " Huh ? " he said . " No . Too risky . " " Not if we hurry , " Rueda snapped . " Almighty God , Daniel , Fidelio 's our link to his entire race ! " " Okay , " Brodersen decided . " Lead us . On the double . " The storeroom was n't far off , nor was it locked , and the rations were t Pttsked handily for carrying , apparently mostly freeze-dried . Burdened , the party sought the nearest shaft , piled on the elevator , and rode it to the hub. ' ! hey said almost nothing on the way . They were stunned . Brodersen t oun ted : himself , Joelle , the alien , Weisenberg , Rueda , Leino , von Moltke . 1 out r saved ; well , that was plenty , if they could bear witness at Earth . If not , he 'd be footnoted " in history as a desperado who got killed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delivered them . They sped down a hall that was sharply rounded . There was the platform . There stood Pegeen , Dozsa , Pegeen , Pegeen . She cheered . Brodersen did not see Zarubayev , who must have been carried inboard . She could have done that in this scant weight . Did he liver That question must wait its turn . Troxell would soon find a course of action . They 'd better be gone before then . Brodersen 's company scrambled up the ladder and into the ship , followed by him . He made for the nearest intercom unit . " Su , get us the hell on our way , " he rasped . Valves closed . The engine awoke . At low acceleration , Chinook withdrewfrom the machinery around her and regained open space . Fingers plucked Brodersen 's sleeve . He looked about and saw von Moltke . " If you please , Mr. Captain , " she said with a hoarse accent , " I hear your gunner is a casualty . I hear too your armament is like on Emissary . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his exhaustion , " yes , it is . " " I was a gunner in Emissary , " she reminded him . " I can check details by your engineers . Let me shoot out the transmission dishes on the Wheel and the ship . Best I disable the ship too . Then they can not tell Earth about us . " As he hesitated : " I doubt they haff called , but they will soon unless we prefent . If we prefent , no harm to them . They must sit quiet till somebody worries and sends a speedster to check . Meanwhile , howeffer , you are carrying out what plan you haff . Correct ? " " All right , " he said , " I authorize . Coordinate it with Phil , Chief Engineer Weisenberg , that is , and with our linker , Granville , " while he longed for nothing but Caitlin . Minutes later , a slicing energy beam made the San Geronimo Wheel mute . It did no further damage ; but a missile left Emissary a whirl of fragments . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We 'd better build us a damn good case for deserving an executive pardon . Never mind now . The immediate objective is just to survive . No . Above and before that , sleep . He barely managed to put affairs temporarily in order and start the ship on a course he deemed proper before he stumbled to bed . Sergei had died . Caitlin held Brodersen close.  |p169AGAIN  AT AN EARTH GRAVITY , Chinook made for the T machine . On the route prescribed , the trip would take six Earth days . " Our best bet is to conform for the time being , while we try to work out a strategy , " Brodersen had explained . " Else they 'll come after us , and a watchship has more legs than we do . We for sure ca n't outrun a tracker missile . " Von Moltke had probably saved him and his following from that , his mind added . News of his assault would have provided the perfect excuse to order this , vessel blown out of existence . That would not by itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Emissary travelers kf t behind , not to mention whatever questions were occurring to Troxell 's outfit ; but presumably they could cope . They would certainly try to cope , and even failure on their part might prove lethal . As was , while Chinook remained at large , bearing the possibility of exposing the whole affair , Langendijk 's faction should be safe from everything worse than continued imprisonment . Indeed , from a tactical viewpoint it was good that Brodersen had not succeeded in releasing them . Now the cause of  --  liberty ?  --  did not have all its eggs in one highly breakablebasket . Half by chance , his operation had worked well . No . It did n't . Men are hurt , men are dead . The agents among them are bad enough . I can live with that  --  their fighting us was almost criminally reckless ; maybe being penned up for weeks drove them a little crazy  --  but Sergei is dead , my own man , my friend . He had awakened beside Caitlin , for a moment conscious only of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shuddering breath roused her , to embrace and murmur to him for a long while . " It 's a war we 're in , Daniel , my darling , and men have ever fallen in war . Yours is just , a strife like whatp170they waged against tyrants and foreign overlords again and again on Earth , and us today the happier for it . I knew Sergei too , aye , better than I 've told you . He joyed in the universe ; but if he must leave it , proud would he be that this was why . " Thus did she slowly give him back his heart , until he could rise and go about his work . Later , though , entering their quarters to fetch something , he found her seated silent , the marks of crying upon her . When he asked what the matter was , she said in a near whisper that she was making a song and wished to be alone . She was absent , on duty , when he met with Joelle Ky , Carlos Rueda Suarez , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gatheringat which his entire band could hear the tale of Emissary . However , he must not delay getting a skeleton of the facts for himself , to aid him in planning , and this was most rapidly done when a minimum of people were on hand . Despite his gratitude to Frieda von Moltke , he did not invite her , for their lack of acquaintance might slow down the proceedings . Carlos was a cousin of Antonia , Brodersen 's first wife . Though he was a child when she died and had not often met his in-law , they shared considerable background . Brodersen had first encountered Joelle on business nineteen Earth-years ago ; since moving to Demeter , he 'd looked her up whenever he revisited the mother planet , and for the past decadeNever certain exactly how he felt about her , she being unlike any other woman ever in his life , he was shocked anew when she entered the office . They had birthdays within a month of each other , but suddenly she was fifty-eight , long gone in a place whose strangeness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black , line the brow he remembered as serene , thin the flesh to a cloak tightly drawn over bones which remained as exquisite as before . He bumbled to his feet . " Joelle , " he said out of a lumpy larynx , " hello . It 's wonderful having you here . " She smiled . That and her voice had n't changed either ; both were pleasing and a little remote , like compositions by Brancusi or Delius . " Thank you for everything , Dan . I 'm so eager to learn precisely what everything ' means  --  certainly an enormous lot  --  " They clasped four hands and might have kissed , but Rueda came through the door and , in Peruvian style , hugged the captain . " Daniel , Daniel , how magnificent ! " His Spanish almost warbled . " Our rescuer , our warrior  --  I 've been talking to some of your crew  --  Do you know , when I was a boy I idolized you . And I was right . By God , but you are a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Brodersenp171studied him for a second . A ghost of Toni lingered in Rueda 's straightlined , short-nosed countenance and hazel eyes . Of medium height , he had laid a small paunch onto his slimness while he was away , and Brodersen understood how he must resent that trace of early eld : doubtless worse than being left with a mere brown fringe of hair . At least his mustache was the same . Then the nonhuman arrived and overwhelmed all other impressions . The chances were that he ( she ? it ? ) had no such intention , Brodersen decided . If anything , the attitude of the creature looked diffident , though how could you tell ? But the sight  --  he 'd need practice before he made complete sense of those contours  --  the gait  --  the smell that was like a seashore , only not really " May I give you a formal introduction to Fidelio ? " Rueda said , smiling . The alien extended the lower right arm . Brodersen shook hands . He 'd done the same with a tame gibbon once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ startled ; the ape 's thumb was laid out wrong and had no ball to it . Fidelio 's clasp made the gibbon 's brotherlike . Brodersen met the eyes , which resembled the eyes of no animal on Earth or Demeter , and forgot about handshakes . It roared in him : This is an intelligent nonhuman being . This is , this is . I 'm living the dream that always was in me . " Fidelio , " he stammered , " welcome . Bienvenido . " " Buenos dias , senor , y muchas gracias , " coughed and whistled out of the fanged mouth . Suddenly Brodersen laughed aloud  --  not at anyone or anything , simply laughing , his mirth reborn . " Come on into the cabin , " he urged after he was through . " What can I offer everybody ? Does Fidelio mind if I smoke ? We may as well be comfortable . " Two hours later , they shared an embryonic idea of what had been going on around Sol , Phoebus , and Centrum . Rueda could no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forth , making gestures like karate chops . Blood had withdrawn from his features , turning the olive skin gray , and he stared at the narrowness enclosing him as his ancestors had stared across sword points on a duelling ground . " It must not be borne , " he declared . " It will not be . They subvert the Covenant , they would close the star gates , ay , kidnapping and murder are small among their crimes . Daniel , Joelle ... Fidelio . . . . Never fear we may do wrong fighting them . We can not . " Cross-legged in an armchair , pipe bowl hot in his clasp and smokep172mordant on a scorched tongue , Brodersen said , " I guess that 's axiomatic , Carlos . The question before this assembly is where we go from here . And how . And whether . " Joelle had chosen a straightbacked seat opposite him and had scarcely stirred except to talk , for the most part giving a dispassionate account of Beta . Her hands lay quiet on her lap . Fidelio sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likewise moved little , save that his whiskers trembled . " You must have an idea or two , Dan , " she said . " Yes ! " Rueda jerked to a halt and stared at the captain . " You were always bold , but never heedless . " Brodersen scowled . " Maybe I have been , this time around . Or maybe there 've been too goddamn many jokers in the deck . I was , well , kind of childishly hoping you from Emissary would have brought back a wild card we could play . " Joelle 's lips quirked upward , barely enough to be seen . " If we had that , we would n't have languished in the Wheel . " " No , but  --  " Brodersen shrugged , drew on his pipe , laid it on an ashtaker , and met their gazes head on . " Okay , " he told them , " naturally my shipmates and I have discussed several schemes . None of them appeal much , but see what you think . " He ticked them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bastards immediately , veer off , scoot around the Solar System . We ca n't prowl forever , but we do have a lot of delta V before our tanks go dry . Food stores are ample for years , and air and water recycling can go on as long as fuel for the migma cells holds out , which is years more .... Oh , of course Fidelio 's limited to  --  what ? Several months ?  --  but we would n't be out in space that long anyway . " You see , the watchships can hunt us down . An accelerating craft is a difficult target , and we can doubtless shoot out some of their missiles , but they 'd swamp our defenses in the end . Meanwhile they'll 've kept us far from Earth or any settlement . That whole effort might turn out to be impractically large and visible for the opposition  --  they ca n't afford publicitywhich they have n't doctored  --  but I would n't count on it . Bear in mind , they 've got a grip on enough of the levers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Ah , but wait , " Rueda said . " We can beam our word , ca n't we ? I suppose your radio transmitter is like ours , not designed to get a message across an astronomical distance . Probably no one would be tuned in anyhow . But the radios are limited precisely because the lasers can reach far . " " Two problems there , " Brodersen replied . " First , a message like that to Earth or Luna or the satellites gets picked up by a comsat , you know , andp173rtssed on from there to its destination . What you may not know , because it hardly ever makes any difference , is that the program includes censorship . Only certain classes of official communications may go in cipher . Everything else , a computer scans , and if it spots a reference to a ' flagged ' subject , the message goes to a human , who decides whether or not it 's harmless . The system dates back to the Troubles , and even I have to admit its not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Finalists before they were quite ready to set off their atomic bombs . But you can bet your bottom sol that when Quick 's bunch started planning what to do in case Emissary returned , a very early order of business for them was to quietly get control of it  --  put in the right programs and personnel so they can intercept whatever may threaten disclosure . " Second , we might be able to get through to somebody else , like in a ship or on an asteroid or a Mars base or something . I say might , ' because most such have very limited receiver facilities  --  we 'd have to get fairly close  --  and only ships are certain to be listening constantly for input . Well , we might , regardless . But if that somebody heard us , would he believe ? And if he did , would others believe him ? Never forget , we 're not up against a maverick like me , we 're bucking some of the biggest and most respected political figures alive . . . who got to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're masters of propaganda and public relations . " All in all , I figure the direct attack has a very poor chance of succeeding . Odds art that we 'd be killed before we could accomplish anything . " What else have we considered ? Well , when we 're near the T machine , we 're bound to be in communication with its watchship . Actually , under present circumstances , more than one watchship will likely be near . We 1 ) t esume the officers and crews for the most part are not villains , are simply to , I lowing orders which may well be puzzling them a bit . If we tell them our story  --  show them Fidelio  --  do you see ? " The trouble here is that the cabal must also have thought of this , and battened down hatches . Else they would n't have told us to go there , huh ? They may not know we have Fidelio aboard , but they do know we 've seen and photographed Emissary . That 's dangerous enough for them . My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ key officers who are in on the conspiracy . The moment we start to tell tales , she 'll throw a barrage at us . Explanations afterward are cheap . We are visibly armed , and I 'm sure there is indeed a warrant out for us on Demeter . It would n't be hard to claim that in the best judgment of those officers , we were about to open fire ourselves . " The third possibility is , we go through the gate to Phoebus and see what 's at yon end . Maybe they 're less well prepared , less equipped , and we an break free or do something else worthwhile . I 've actually consideredp174since we 've got you here , your knowledge  --  I 've considered trying to run the pattern that 'll bring us to Centrum from Phoebus , and asking for help at Beta . But it 's a pretty wild notion , because the guardians are n't likely to grant us much leeway . " In fact , what worries me about making the transit we 're supposed to , is ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ news is n't hard to control . It 'd be simple to scrag us . For instance , as soon as we 're well away from the T machine and the regular watch crew , the ship escorting us could fire a missile . Afterward the world would hear about the tragic accident which destroyed Chinook . I 'd hate to believe this of Aurie Hancock , but it is possible . Otherwise we 'll be interned indefinitely . The Phoebean System has plenty of sites for a secret prison camp . I daresay we 'd be joined by the rest of your crew . " And that 's the extent of our thinking to date . My own instinct says we should tentatively plan on returning to Phoebus and doing whatever seems best when we get there , though keeping our eyes and our options open until then . I may well be wrong . I 'd sure be glad of any suggestions . " Whew ! " Brodersen finished . " What a lecture ! I could use another beer . Anybody else ? " He rose to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " What ? " He checked his stride . Seldom  --  when a problem was unusually arousing , or when things got really good in bed  --  had he seen a light such as kindled her countenance . " Dan , " she told him , her voice ashiver , " we can go straight from Sol to Centrum . " " What ? " he yelped . " Yes . " She sat forward . " The Betans , they 've been exploring the gates for a thousand years . They 've gone beyond trial and error . They do n't have a complete theory ; nothing compared to what the Others know  --  " " The Others , " Rueda murmured. "  --  but they have achieved some comprehension , " Joelle went on . " Take three places , three stars if you want , A , B , C , with known gates  --  T machine guidepaths  --  from A to B and from B to C. Then the Betans can compute a direct route between A and C. " It was like a nova burst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joelle was saying . " They have n't measured the local curvatures of the continuum that well . But the probabilityof success is high . Surely higher than for the schemes you 've described . " " And  --  and  --  " Brodersen groped through splendors . " We can go to the Sol machine . . . make like starting for Phoebus . . . then lie , bluff , threaten ,  |p175or  whatever , till we 're so far into the transport field that we 're nearly an impossible target . . . . We 'll come out at Centrum . Go to Beta . Come back leading a Betan armada . " " Whose only offensive weapon need be the truth , " Rueda said . Whether or not he had heard about the physics earlier , the idea was new to him also . He too stood transfixed by revelation . Brodersen snatched the beer glass which had stood by his chair and Nw ung it in circles over his head . " By the honor of the house ! " he roared out of his youth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " The computation is difficult , " Joelle warned . " Fidelio and I will need to conduct research , and I 'll need to apply holothetics . You do have liolothetic capabilities aboard , do n't you ? " The flame in her now was like nothing he had ever seen . I shall return to what I am , radiated forth . Heat and cold fled across her cheeks . I shall again be One with the All . Rueda rested an intent look upon her . It was as if Brodersen could read the Peruvian 's mind . Will you become , for us , what the Others refuse to be ? They would give Sergei Nikolayevitch Zarubayev a spaceman 's funeral , launching his flag-shrouded body from an airlock , on a bier driven by a signal rocket , while his shipmates stood by and heard their captain read the eel vice . AFirst Caitlin took the obligation as medical officer of washing him and laying him out in his cabin . From four bowls which she filled with oil , and wicks of string afloat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burn at 1t is head and his feet . The fluoros she turned off ; and she called for a wake ( ca him . She met a little surprise , a little objection  --  barbarous custom ; the t ivilized thing was to gather afterward , with coffee  --  but Brodersen , Dozsa , Ganville , and von Moltke understood , though it was in none of their own tt.uiitions , and made the rest agree . ( The skipper felt that he and his people needed to get drunk , in this pause between battles , and Sergei would have appreciated being the occasion of it . ) They held the party in the common to H an . Su and Stefan had decorated it somewhat , making paper flowers and the like . Hard liquor and pot appeared , besides the usual refreshments ; viewscreens brought in the universe for a larger ornament ; music Sergei had favored and ballet he had loved rollicked in playback . Folk stood w r c n i nd and remembered him . After several hours , Martti Leino left . By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around shoulders , Brodersen , Weisenberg , and Dozsa werep176tunelessly belting out " Ford of Kabul River . " Von Moltke and Rueda snuggled in a corner . Granville and Ky held a serious conversation . Fidelio observed the exotic race . Leino walked down the circular hall to Zarubayev 's quarters . The door stood open . He heard a few notes , hesitated , frowned , and went on in . As bare as the rest , this room was draped in shadow and yellow lamplight . Zarubayev lay on his bed , attired in his uniform . Hair and beard glowed through dimness ; otherwise his face had gone empty . The flames around him threw off a clean odor and the tiniest warmth . Caitlin sat beside him . She wore a blue kaftan , the best gown she had along . Her locks streamed unbound . In her left arm she cradled her sonador while her right fingers drew from it sounds like a muted woodwind . She stopped when Leino entered . " Oh , " she breathed . " What  --  " He tightened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " No . Wait . Do n't go . " Caitlin made to rise , saw him unbrace a minikin bit , and sank back down . " You came to say farewell . I 'd not stand in the way of that . " He bunched his fists and hastily released them . " You do n't , Miz Mulryan . " " You 've no kindness for me . " " Hoy , this is nil time for hakkerie . " " I meant no more than this , Mr. Leino : if it 's alone you 'd be with your friend , I can well come back later . " She did get up . Startled , he exclaimed , " Stop . Please . I knew you kenned him before , but not that you ... cared . " She smiled most gently . " Aye , he was the quiet lad , was he not ? " Stillness ; then , low : " Even when showing me , this voyage , how to handle firearms in combat , he took none of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd have liked it . For he saw me now as Daniel 's woman , not his captain 's but his friend 's . The which gives away much about him , does n't it ? " He flushed . " When did you first meet him ? " " Before I met Daniel . He came to the hospital , injured , as you may recall . We bantered amidst his pain . The world thought him humorless , but that was not true . Oh , he spun me the wildest yarn about the trouble he was having , him a Russian who did not enjoy chess .... After he got well , we met when we could , until I started spending my whiles in Eopolis with Daniel . We were never deep in love , Sergei and I , but he meant an oceanful to me . " " And tome , " Leino said slowly , staring at her where she stood in front ofp177the dead man . " We were on jobs together in space , the kind where you trust your life to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sailing , partying  --  " His talk trailed off . She nodded . " What happens between man and man , no woman will ever truly understand ; but precious it is . " Half drunk , he threw at her : " What about man and woman ? " She turned to brush fingertips across the countenance which had been Zarubayev 's . " That 's worse to find words for , however long and hard the poets have tried . " Her glance went back to Leino . " Indeed Sergei and I , bared , more than simple pleasure . " Again it sought him who did not move . " They never realized , " she said , nigh under her breath . " They took him for dour when he was only shy ; but oh , the fun in him when once he felt at his easel They took him for being practical as a machine ; but I recall a night we brought a telescope outdoors , and after we 'd lost ourselves in the forever , he began to speak of the Others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they seem to , but most have a care and compassion we are too small to feel  --  " She broke off . " Well , " she said , " you do n't want me to maunder , you want to give him his sending from you . Goodnight , Martti Leino . " " Nol " He lifted a palm as if to block her . " Please stay . I did n't know anyone else was so near to him . " He rubbed a wrist across his eyes . " Forgive me . May I ask what you were doing in here ? " " Nothing to mention . " Ile insisted : " You were singing . " She squared her shoulders . " Well , yes , I was that , a song , as we do in the Irish countryside . But it would be wrong to put on a show when such is not the way of my fellows aboard . Goodnight . " I le stretched an arm in her path . " Please , Miz Mulryan  --  Caitlinpleasedo n't go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Why ? " " Because , oh , I told you , we share a heavy loss and ... they 're singing Killing songs in the common room  --  What is yours ? " She dropped her lashes . " Merely an ochlan . A dirge , you 'd say . " " Would you do it over ? " She regarded him for a moment before she decided . " Aye , since it is you who wish . He would have himself . " ' They sat down on either side of the bed . The lamps flickered , shadows moved inward , ventilators whispered . Faint , rowdy sounds which drifted in Irom the wake did not seem out of place . Caitlin 's fingers evoked the " I . ondonderry Air . "  |p178Oh  , would the stars might mourn for this our comrade , Weep tears of light across a riven sky , Or that the rain which falls upon his homelandWere bidding him a long and last goodbye , Or at the least , a blossom drop to kiss himFrom off a tree where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all alone in grieving . The world would sorrow too , the world that he loved so . But silence reigns among the suns and planets . The leaves are dumb , the weather 's deaf and blind .

Ochone , ochone ! He is no more forever . What 's left for us lies still , yet still is very dear.  |p179I  WAS A CROW . My first dim dreams ended in hunger when the universe went void . Angered , I tapped at its shell until this broke apart ; and there was the day . My eyes filled with dazzle . I opened my mouth to it and yawped for food . Wings overshadowed me , a beak large and hard thrust into my gale , love poured thence to my inside . Soon I was aware that naked others were crowding me , so I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Plumage grew on us , and we spent much time happily admiring our gown glossy blackness . But before long our parents shoved us from the nest . Af to the first beautiful terror and wild flapping , I learned how the wind a t n t l d upbear me and what power lay ready to be unfolded in my wings . I took the air unto me , soared , swooped , glided , rejoiced . The sky was mine , and the whole earth below it ripe for raiding . I belonged to the flock , of course , and had my place in the ranking and my occasional duties , such as watching out for hawks or men when we Knight the lands beyond our woods . I never wished things were otherwise . C ? ows have fun . We chattered , intrigued , shouted our mirth , went off on expeditions , persecuted owls , found goodies to eat and sparkly things to In mg home , were endlessly entertained by the antics of alien creatures , i ? n clad it over the treetops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still peck a living out of the snowcrust . But oh , the green and rustling summers ! Oh , my female and our darling small chicks ! I grew old at last , weak , slow , though my knowledge of this was misty . One day a fox caught me on the ground . I broke free of his jaws , but bloodp180spattered out of me until I could fly no more . Finding me a thicket , I sprawled on damp mushroomy soil , shut away from the sky , panting , while darkness blew ever stronger through me . Then the Summoner came and , still alive for a while , I departed that country wherein I had been Bird.  |p181A  CHIME SOUNDED through the cabin Joelle had taken . " Come in , " she led . Brodersen did , closing the door behind him . Framed by the impersonal mber , he seemed doubly big and vivid . It blazed up in her that she nted him . Stop that nonsense ! she ordered herself . He 's busy , preoccupied , see the gardness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gray eyes look re downward-slanting than ever . Furthermore , I will shortly begin my per work , the wonder of Oneness will possess me and nothing else will tier . Nevertheless desire continued to thrill faintly along her veins . Eightrs , no , nearer nine , and Brodersen had been that last lover , when he Ntti t cd Earth  --  She 'd not found celibacy difficult on the expedition , when every waking hour was charged with discovery . The risk of a man getting one ' ionally involved and pestering her when she wanted to carry out a ' atty  --  ct ( as had happened a couple of times at home ) was an overly high ytte e for the rubbing of an itch that came infrequently anyway . Of course , tt1 last I did pay . Christine  --  Chris lay buried on Beta . Dan was here , two meters from her . " I stopped by to check on how you 're doing , " his deep voice said . " Quite well , thank you , " Joelle replied above her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foresighted enough to keep this ship completely stocked . " " Foresighted , hell . " He grinned . " I was champing at the bit , and figured that if anything broke my way  --  like you coming home early  --  I should be reedy to take off myself before some bureaucrat found a reason to refuse me cleat ance. "  |p182He  glanced around . " Just the same , we got caught pretty flatfooted , " he said . " And you folks from the Wheel are worse off . Uh , about changes of clothes for you . Pegeen  --  Caitlin Mulryan , our quartermaster , you recall , she 'll be happy to lend you a couple of things  --  you 're about the same size  --  and she 'll make more out of spare cloth we 've got along when she gets a chance , for you and whoever else wants . She 's a good seamstress . You might be thinking what sorts of garment you 'd prefer . " Joelle shrugged . " You know I do n't care , provided it 's comfortable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll try to remember to do so in person , but you also know how forgetful I am about everyday matters . " " What more can you use ? For instance , most of us keep a small private stock of food and drink . I imagine you 'd rather not eat every meal in the mess . " " Oh , if they do n't mind me often being a poor conversationalist , I do n't mind sitting at a public table . I shut the noise out . . . . But it would be nice if I could offer you  --  offer a guest refreshment . " She gestured , noting how awkward the motion was . " Wo n't you sit down ? And , well , I did n't acquire any dislike of a pipe while I was gone . " " I noticed that at the conference , and was glad . " He took a chair . She brought another to face it . Fetching out his tobacco pouch , he went on , " I ca n't stay but a minute or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bath you say Fidelio needs . We have the chemicals , I 'm sure , and the metal or plastic or whatever for a container , but we 'd better make some recycling arrangement too , in case this trip stretches out longer than I hope it will . " " Is n't that a problem for your engineers ? " " Yes , but first Fidelio has to explain exactly what the requirements are . That 'll be slow , even with Carlos to help , he knowing some of the Betan language . No , languages , right ? You 're the expert in those , but I gather you 're due for a computer session . I think I can help discussion keep moving . Not to mention forty million other things that need attention before I knock off . " " Do call on me if you encounter serious linguistic problems . By the way , would you consider modifying a set of encephalic attachments for Fidelio , so he can link in with me ? He 's a holothete . " " Huh ? I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personality less among Betans than among humans . " Silence closed in while she tried to say what she wanted to say . Breaking the barrier in a rush : " Dan , it 's wonderful seeing you again . More than being liberated . You were the man who did it . " He became busy charging his pipe . " No , we did , the team of us ; and Sergei  --  We may not have done you a favor . You 're headed into danger . "  | " Were we in no danger in the Wheel ? " " Yeah , true . .. I guess .... I have to keep shoving away this nightmare notion that we 're dead wrong in what we 're trying to do . That I 'm putting lives at hazard for naught . " She managed to lean forward and drop a hand on his knee . " Do n't fret . Politics always confuses me , but you 've a feel for it and a knowledge . I rely on your judgment , as you 'll have to rely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " I 'd better , " he said dryly . His fingers remained at work on his pipe . " Well , are you set to make that analysis , Joelle ? " Have I grown too gaunt and gray for him ? She withdrew her touch . " Yes . It 'd be easier , perhaps more certain , if Fidelio and I could operate as a holothetic unit and take a complete theoretical structure from a memory bank . However , I did master the physical principles the Betans have found apply to the T machines  --  those were right down my alley , as you 'd put it  --  and he and I have finished ransacking your ship 's data collection for exact parameters of local space-time . The information appears to be sufficient . I expect I 'll need a preliminary run-through today , then tomorrow work out the guidepath in detail . " He got worry lines between his brows , the way he 'd done when first they met , he an Aventureros engineer consulting her about a thorny design problem . Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though really she cfoubted , it was better than his  --  differently configured and oriented , but not intrinsically better  --  except when she was joined to her machine . He 'd found excuses to meet her later on , which led to outright dinner dates after he was widowed and had moved to Demeter and made occasional trips Farthside . She enjoyed his company as she enjoyed a gust off the sea . Eventually , impulsively , she let him into her bed , and was astounded .... How young those worry lines made him look . " Supposing we do reach Beta , " he said , " will they help us ? You and Carlos emphasized how they do n't want to interfere , how careful they 've always been about respecting less advanced species . " " Humankind is special to them , though , " she assured him . " We 'll have extensive explaining and persuading to do , I admit . But when we of Emissary described our history and sociology , what little we could convey , they found it no more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Their leaders do believe we can help them through their psychosexual crisis . " " So they 'd  --  m-m-m  --  what ? " " Make an appearance in the Solar System , I imagine , invincible , but simply protecting us while we broadcast the facts to Earth . "  | " And they offer us a fabulous bargain , you said . Their technology in exchange for franchises to exploit Jupiter and Saturn , which we ca n't anyway . Right ? " Brodersen struck fire to tobacco , peering at her across it . " Of course , that will destroy the Actionists , and every party like theirs . Quite aside from the scandal , I mean . The whole philosophy will be killed . " " How ? " " Why , it 's obvious . As fast as we acquire that same technology , we 'll skite off through every star gate the Betans have mapped , as well as mounting our own program to chart new ones . The sheer profit to be made , in countless places and ways , must beggar the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ giant planets ? So even before we start large-scale emigration , the balance of economic power will shift away from Earth . It 'll also shift away from governments , unions , giant corporations , toward small outfits and individuals . There goes the tidy world welfare state the Actionist types hope to build . I daresay Quick foresees as much . " Joelle frowned , striving to comprehend . " But that is n't logical , Dan . Presumably welfare measures serve a need . If the need comes to an end , who would want to continue them ? " Brodersen laughed the ringing laugh she knew . Smoke burst from his mouth . It smelled masculine . " Dear , you 're doing it again . Assuming people are logical . They are n't . The welfare state  --  any state  --  is an end in itself . It 's the way for a few to impose their will on the many . And Judas priest , how those few do want to ! Need to . " He puffed on his pipe . " Talk with Stef @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the mill , over and over . Holy Roman Empire , Mongol Empire , Ottoman Empire , Austrian Empire , Soviet Empire , Balkan Empire .... No , maybe you should n't . That history 's made a rabid anarchist of him . Harmless in his case , but if he converted you  --  well , under your stiffish exterior , Joelle , you 've got a lot of wildness bottled up . I know . " You do , Dan ! Brodersen stirred . " My personal weakness is I ramble , " he said . " I 'd better stop boring you and carry on in my proper job . " " You were n't boring me , " Joelle answered with effort . She felt the heat in her face and breasts . " You never did . Were always rather fascinating , in fact , I suppose because we 're so unlike . " " Yeah , we are . Well , anyhow . " He rose . She did too . " Why do n't you come by this evenwatch after we 're both off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some food and wine . Remember how you used to do the cooking ? I 'm still terrible at that , but ... I 'll bet you 've improved . "  | " Not much . " He looked at his toes . " Besides , I  --  Happens I have a date . Sorry , but it 's not the kind a person breaks . " " May I ask what ? " she said through the hurt . " Caitlin and I have an anniversary . Demetrian calendar ; comes oftener that way . " He raised his eyes . " Did n't you know ? I thought it was obvious . . . . No , we 're not married , I 'm still with Lis and have no plans to change , but Caitlin  --  well , she and I are awfully close . " " I see . " He caught her hands . " Joelle , uh , she 's not jealous . I mean  --  oh , hell , it 's fine having you here , and  --  Not propositioning you , but if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself smile , lean forward , touch lips to his . " I might . We need n't be in a hurry , though . And do n't you feel obligated . " Because I fear that is what you feel right now , obligated . Caitlin is like a fair-skinned Chris . Besides , I 'll soon be transhuman . " All right , Dan . So long . " Small , plain , humble , though never servile , Susanne Granville waited in the main computer room . She had turned on the viewscreen , scanner aimed at Sol , and sat watching . Dimmed but magnified , the disc was a turmoil of spots , flares , fountaining prominences , within coronal nacre . Music sparkled . Joelle recognized Nielsen 's Fynsk Fordr . Music , like architecthre , was one of the few formal human arts she thought she responded properly to . She and Susanne had talked about it for an hour or more during the memorial party for the gunner . " Hello , " she said . " I did n't expect to find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew you would be running a final check on the software , Dr. Ky , and wondered if I might be of assistance . Just in case , I excused me from ' elping the quartermaster Caitlin Mulryan make dinner . " Oh , yes , Joelle did not reply . How often I 've met this . You are the mere linker , I the supreme holothete . Your eagerness is to know you 've been of **se to me . Like Chris , like Chris . You 'll see me in my linkage , that you are not capable of , ascending to a heaven you can never reach but which you have glimpsed in fragments . I will touch the Absolute , I will be in the Noumenon , I will know Final Reality , not as a mathematical construct , but immediately , in my brain and hones . O Susanne ! she thought . I wish I might kiss and comfort you , asI could not Chris , as I could not Eric . Her mind veered ( and this irritated her , made her twice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not occur ) to ask how much she was originally attracted to Brodersen because his mother was a Stranathan and he had visited that family many times as a boy . Eric Stranathan was of it , Joelle 's first and most unforgotten lover , son of the Captain General of the Fraser Valley , himself a linker . It was they together , Joelle and Eric , who were the earliest to learn that the gulf between linker and holothete was not one of degree but of kind , unbridgeably wide . For no clear reason , her recollection fled back to a dull lecturer in a stuffy hall , at a convention in Calgary ... but the reason was clear ; that evening she 'd met him.  |p187The  Memory Bank " THE HUMAN BRAIN , and hence the entire nervous system , can be Integrated with a computer of the proper design , " the speaker was droning . " We have long since progressed beyond the wires in the head ' stage . =lectromagnetic induction suffices to make a linkage . The computer then applies its vast capacity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mathematico-logical operations in microseconds or less . Thein , though far slower , supplies creativity and flexibility ; in effect , it continuously rewrites the program . Computers which can do this for themsel#es do exist , of course , but for most purposes they do not function pearly as well as a computer-operator linkage does , and we may never be able to improve them significantly . After all , the brain packs trillions of cells into a mass of about a kilogram . Furthermore , linkage gives humans direct access to what they would otherwise know only indirectly . For present , practical purposes , its advantages are twofold . ( a ) As I remarked , programs can be altered on the spot , in the course of being carried out . Formerly it was necessary to run them through , painstakingly check their results , and then slowly rewrite them , with possibilities of error , and without any guarantee that the new versions would turn out to be what We most needed . Once linkers and their equipment come into everyday use , We will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very experience , as I have also suggested , the linker gains insights which he or she could have gotten in no other way , and hence becomes a more able scientist  --  including a better writer of programs  --  when working independently of the apparatus , too . " Good Lord ! Joelle thought . Do we really have to endure this ? True , the conference was an important political as well as scientific event . The military secrecy in which she had been raised was beginning to lift ; here in Calgary , people could freely discuss developments which hadp188been hidden for decades or worse ; the public was entitled to information , in popular terms , during the opening ceremonies . The trouble was , no words could describe being in linkage : creating n-dimensional spaces , and time-variant curvatures for them , and tensors within , and functions and operations that nobody had ever before imagined . You fashioned a conceptual cosmos , learned that it was wanting and annulled it , devised another and another , until at last you saw what you had made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time the numbers rushed through you to verify , and you knew how much reality you had embraced , it was an outbursting of revelation . The Christian hopes to be eternally in the presence of God , the Buddhist hopes to become one with the all in Nirvana , the linker hopes to achieve more than genius  --  is there a vast difference between them ? Yes : the linker , in this life , does it . In days , hours , fractional seconds . Afterward he or she can not entirely comprehend what happened . The high moment of love also lies outside of time ; but we understand it better , when at peace , than the linker understandswhat the linker has known . Joelle 's gaze roved . Hey , was n't that a handsome young man a dozen seats to her right ! Why had n't she seen him earlier ? Well , she was n't given to noticing people . War orphan , brought up from infancy in the pioneering holothetic program , lately released into academe as the Troubles faded out , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opposite sex and was n't sure she wanted to "  --  while linkage to macroscopic machinery has not proven costeffective , the case has turned out to be otherwise for monitoring and controlling scientific instruments . For this it is inadequate to supply the operating brain with numbers such as voltmeter readings and nothing else . For example , a spectrum is best considered  --  rationally appreciated  --  when the operator sees it and , simultaneously , knows the exact wavelength and intensity of every line . Through appropriate hardware and software , this can now be done . Subjectively , it is like sensing the data directly , as if the nervous system had grown complete new input organs of unprecedented power and sensitivity . " Workers elsewhere have experimented with that . The principal thing Project Ithaca in which Joelle was raised , a part of it did was to take the next step . What is the meaning of those data , those sensations ? " In everyday life , we do not apprehend the world as a jumble of raw impressions , but as an orderly structure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and brown ; we see a tree , of such-and-such a kind , at such-and-such : , distance . Although it is done unconsciously , yes , instinctively , since animals do it too , nevertheless we may be said to build theories , models , ofp189the world , within which our direct perceptions are made to make sense . Naturally , we modify these models when that seems reasonable . For instance , we may decide that we are not really seeing a tree but a piece of camouflage . We may realize that we have misjudged its distance because the air is more clear or murky than we knew at first . Basically , however , through our models we comprehend and can act in an objective universe . " Science has long been adding to our store of information and thus forcing us to change our model of the cosmos as a whole , until today it embraces billions of years and light-years , in which are galaxies , subatomic particles , the evolution of life , and everything else that our ancestors never I suspected . To most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been rather abstract , no matter how immediate the impact of the technologies it makes possible . " In order to enhance laboratory capability , Project Ithaca began work on means to supply a linkage operator directly with theory as well as data . This was more than learning a subject , permanently or temporarily . Any operator has to do that , in order to think about a given task . And indeed , outstanding accomplishments came out of the Turing Institute here , pioneering ways for the linked computer to give its human partner the necessary knowledge . Project Ithaca greatly improved such systems , and its civilian successors continue to progress . We call them holothetic . " The work has had an unexpected result . Those operators whom Ithaca trained from childhood , linkers who today are adults advancing the art in t heir turn , are more and more getting into a mode that I must call intuitive . ' baseball pitcher , an acrobat , or simply a person walking is constantly solving complex problems in physics with little or no conscious thought . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have for example reached the point of manipulating individual amino acids within protein molecules , using ions directed by force-fields which are directed by a 1olothete , in a manner that perhaps only the Others could plan out step by step . Likewise for any number of undertakings . Direct perception through holothetics is leading to comprehension on a nonverbal level . " This is doubly true because our theoretical knowledge is far from perfect . Quite frequently these days , a holothete senses that things are not going as intended , that something is wrong with the model  --  and intuits what changes to make , what the real situation is , as we so often do in our ordinary lives . Later systematic study generally confirms the intuition . " My colleagues will be discussing various aspects of holothetic linkage . This introductory sketch of mine  --  " When the dullness was outlived and the audience moving toward drinks , Eric came over and introduced himself . He had been noticing too.  |p190In  a canoe on Lake Louise , they shipped their paddles and idled . The water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above forest , mountains sheered aloft into silence . Ever so slightly , the boat rocked with each motion they made . She dipped a finger over the side and watched how ripples spread . " Electron interferences make a moire too , " she mused . " It 's wonderful finding the same here . I never paid attention before . " She looked at him and savored . " Thank you for bringing me . " A little scared , she let her eyes drift elsewhere . " Electrons do it in three dimensions . No , four , but I have n't perceived that ... yet . " She had made similar remarks to him after they 'd attended the ballet in Calgary . Over coffee and brandy she had told him how sublimely Newtonian Swan Lake and Ondine were , when to him  --  he said  --  they were sublimely sexy . Still , he , a linker , found as much mathematics as melody in a Bach recital , or admired above everything else the subtle perspectives in Monet . ( Looking at the same 3-faxes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said he believed critics of the past couple of centuries had been blind . ) Today , for whatever reason , she saw unease stir in him . " Look , Joelle , do n't get lost in abstractions  --  Wait . Please . Let me explain what I mean . Sure , you and I work with data , set up paradigms , compute resultants , sure . Fine . Fine job . But let 's not let that interfere with what we , well , find in places like this . In our private lives especially . This  --  " he waved a hand around the horizon  --  " is what 's real . Everything else we infer . This is what we 're alive in . " She regarded him for a long while , during which he glowed . That night they became lovers . He Canadian , she American , in an era when military governments were paranoid after the Troubles , before their countries federated and joined the World Union ... he and she were separated for more than a year . Meanwhileholothetics was evolving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wholly new order of perceiving and existing . She sensed her growth away from him , and it hurt , but she could no more resist what she was becoming than a fetus in the womb can . By the time he had finally arranged to come join her at the University of Kansas for R &; D purposes , she knew what he must learn and had completed the necessary arrangements . When he arrived at her office , they made love . Then they made ap191sandwich lunch and talked . At last she leaned over and kissed him , lingeringly but tenderly , almost as if she bade goodbye to a child . " Let 's go ! " she said . As she led the way to her laboratory , her stride became triumphant . Down there , she warned , " Words are no use here . You must experience for yourself . We 're about to become more intimate than ever in bed . Enormously more . " Quasi-telepathic effects had been reported , when a passive linker in a liolothetic circuit not only received the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one did , but " felt " that latter 's ongoing evaluations . " You , uh , you 'll slave my unit to yours ? " Eric inquired . " According to what I 've seen in the literature , that does n't convey a particularly strong or clear impres-uon . " " Everything is n't in the current literature . I told you I  --  we  --  all right , I am making whirlwind progress . I 've acquired a , I do n't know , an insight , a near-instinct , and the feedback between me and the system , the continuous reprogramming at each session  --  " She tugged his sleeve . " Come along . ( wt. to know ! " " What do you have in mind ? " She frowned the least bit . " That 'll depend partly on you , how you 're taking what happens . We 'll begin with you and the 707 . Just think in it for a while , get settled down . Then , through the cross-connections , I 'll phase you in with me and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to you , no access to effectors , or you might ruin some delicate experiments . I 'm going to look in on them , you see . My help is called for often enough that we have constantly open channels between them and my system . Genetics at a lab right on this campus ; nuclear physics at the big accelerator in Minnesota ; cosmology in Sagan Orbital . I hope I can lead you to a hint of what I 'm doing these days . I 'll know , because you will have an output of a kind to me . In effect , I 'll be scanning your mind . Yes , " she said into his stupefaction , " I 've reached that stage . " Afterward  --  " She threw her arms around him and kissed him . " Let there be an afterward . " He responded , but she sensed he sensed that her tone had been kind rut her than prayerful . He lowered himself into the proper lounger , set it at the reclining angle he liked , let muscle and bone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his head , adjusted and secured it , put his wrists through the contact He tapped fingers across a control plate and checked out the settings . Klrile linking herself likewise , she saw the olden thrill shaking the fret out of him.  | " Activate ? " he asked . " Proceed , " she answered . " I love you , " he said , and pressed the main switch . Thereafter she felt and thought what he did , with a minor part of hey awareness . Momentarily , senses and intellect whirled , he imagined he heard a wild high piping , memories broke forth out of long burial as if he had fallen back through time to this boyhood swimming hole and moss cold and green upon a rock , that hawk at hover and the rough wool of a mackinaw around him . Then his nervous system steadied into mastery . Electromagneticinduction , amplification of the faintest impulses , a basic program which he had over the years refined to fit his unique self , meshed ; human and computer became a whole . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ response : How could he not , when his was now a mightier genius than any which had been on Earth before his day ? " Words are no use here , " she told me . They were fully cognizant of their environment . Had they wanted to , they could have examined its most micrometric details , a scratch and a reflection on polished metal , the shimmy of a needle across a meter , mumble and faint tang of oil in the ventilation , back-and-forth tides in the veins . But she sensed that even she no longer entirely mattered to him . He had a perceptual universe to conquer . In the next several milliseconds , while he cast about for a problem worth tackling , a fraction of him calculated the value of an elliptic integral to a thousand decimal places . It was a pleasant semi-automatic exercise . The numbers fell together most satisfyingly , like bricks beneath the hands of a mason . A h , came to him , yes , the stability of Red Spot vortices on planets like Jupiter , yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The sweep hand on a wall clock had barely stirred . He marshalled a list of the data he thought he would need and sent a command . To him it felt like searching his normal memory for a fact or two , except that this went meteorically faster and more assuredly , in spite of drawing on banks which were hundreds of kilometers away . The theory reached him , formulas , specific values of quantities , yes , that particular differential equation would be an absolute bitch to solve ; no , wait , he saw a dodge ; but was the equation actually plausible , could n't he devise a set of relationships which better described conditions on an aborted sun  --  ? An ice-clean fire arose , he was losing himself in it , he was getting drunk on sanity . Eric , she called : no voice , no name , a touch.  |p193He  must wrench his attention from Jupiter , with a vow , I 'll be back . Eric , are you ready to follow me ? It was not truly a question , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . At dazzling speed , as neurone webs adapted to each other 's synapse patterns , she merged with him . The formless eddies that go behind shut eyelids were not shaping into her image ; rather he got fleeting impressions of himself , before her presence flooded him . Was it her femaleness he knew as a secret current in the blood , a waiting to receive and afterward cherish and finally give , a bidding she chose not to heed but which would always be there ? He could n't tell , he might never know , for the union was only partial . He had not learned how to accept and understand most of the signals that entered bim , and there were many more which his body never would be able to receive . That became a pain in him as it was in her . Eric , in this too you are my first man , and I think my last . Forebrains , more alike than the rest of their organisms , meshed . Besides , Jodie had practiced cross-exchange on that level and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was expert . Communication between her and Eric strengthened and clarified , second by second . It was not direct , but through their computers , whose translations were inevitably imperfect . Impressions were often fragmentary and distorted , or outright gibberish  --  bursts of random numbers , shapes , light flashes , noises , less recognizable non-symbols , which would have frightened him were it not ' *'IDr the underlying constancy of her . What touched his mind as her thoughts were surely reconstructions , by his augmented logical powers , of what it supposed she might be thinking at a given instant . The real words that passed between them went in the common mortal fashion , from lips to  --  r . Nevertheless : he took her meanings with a fullness , a depth he had not dreamed could be , there on the threshold of her universe . " Genetics , " she said aloud . That was the sole clue he needed . She would gu isle him to the research at this school . Knowledge sprang forth . The work Was on the submolecular level @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feciccently called on to carry out the most exacting tasks , invent new ones , of iccterpret results . Today the setup was in part running automatically , in pai on standby ; but she had access to it anytime . Her brain ordered the right circuits closed , and she was joined to the pmplex of instruments , sensors , effectors , and to the entire comprehension man had of the chemistry of life . Receiving from her , Eric perceived . : He got no presentation of quantities , readings on gauges whose significancebecame plain after long calculation . That is , the numbers werep194present , but in the experience he was hardly more conscious of them than he was of his skeleton . He was not looking from outside and making inferences , he was there . It was seeing , feeling , hearing , traveling , though not any of those things , for it went beyond what the poor limited human creature could ever sense or do , and beyond and beyond . The cell lived . Pulsations crossed its membrane , like colors , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intricate fluid flow that cradled it in deliciousness , avidly drinking energies which cataracted toward it down ever-changing gradients . Green distances reached to golden infinity . Beneath every ongoing fulfillment dwelt peace . The cosmos of the cell was a Nirvana that danced . Now inward , through the rainbows , to the interior ocean . Here went a maelstrom of ... tastes ... and here ruled a gigantic underlying purposefulness ; within the cell , work forever went on , driven by a law so allencompassingthat it might have been God the Captain . Organelles drifted by , seeming to sing while they wove together chemical scraps to make stuff that came alive . As the scale of his cognition grew finer , Eric saw them spread out into Gothic soarings , full of mysteries and music . Ahead of him , the nucleus waxed from an island of molecular forests to a galaxy of constellated atoms whose force-fields shone like wind-blown star-clouds . He entered it , he swept up a double helix , tier after tier of awesome and wholly harmonious labyrinths , he was with Joelle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temple , which was not less beautiful thereafter , he shared her pride and her humility , here at the heart of life . Her voice came far-off and enigmatic , heard through dream : " Follow me on . " He swept out of the cell , through space and through time , at lightspeedacross unseen prairies , into the storms that raged down a great particle accelerator . He became one with them , possessed by their own headlong fervor , the same speed filled him and he lanced toward the goal as if to meet a lover . This world outranged the material . He transcended the comet which meson he had become , for he was also a wave intermingling with a trillion other waves , like a crest that had crossed a sea to rise and break at last in sunlit foam and a roar  --  though these waves were boundlessly more shapeful and fleetly changeable , they flowed together to create a unity which flamed and thundered around an implacable serenity  --  Bach could tell a little of this , passed through him , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high part of the glory  --  but he alone could , and it would only be a littlep195The atom awaited him . Its kernel , where energies querned , was majestic beyond any telling . Electron shells , elfinly asparkle , veiled it from him . He plunged through , the forces gave him uncountable caresses , the kernel shone ahead , itself an entire creation , he pierced its outer barriers and they sent a rapturous shudder across him , he probed in and in . The kernel burst . That was no disaster , it was an unfolding . The atom embraced him , yielded to him , his being responded to her every least wild movement , he knew her . Radiance exploded outward . The morning stars sang together , and all the sons of God shouted for joy . " Cosmology , " said Joelle the omnipotent . He fumbled to find her in a toppling darkness . She enfolded him and they flew together , up a laser beam , through a satellite relay , to an observatory in orbit beyond the Moon . Briefly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unblurred by any sky . Their multitudes , steel-blue , frost-white , sunset-gold , coal-red , almost glittered the night out of heaven . The Milky Way rivered in silver , nebulae glowed where new suns and planets were being born , a sister galaxy flung her faint gleam across Ginnungagap . But at once he leagued with the instrumentality which was seeking the uttermost ends of space-time . First he was aware of optical spectra . They told him of light that bloomed from leaping and whirling gas , they told him of tides in the body of a sun  --  a body more like the living cell than he could have imagined before  --  and of the furnaces down below where atoms begot higher elemental generations and photons racing spaceward were the birthcry . And in this Brahma-play he shared . Next he felt a solar wind blow past , he snuffed its richness , tingled to its keenness , and knew the millennial subtlety of its work . Thereafter he gave himself to radio spectra , cosmic ray spectra , magnetic fields , neutrino fluxes , relativistics which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the curve of the continuum that is the all . At the Grand Canyon of the Colorado you may see strata going back a billion years , and across the view of them a gnarly juniper , and know something of Earth . Thus did Eric learn something of the depths and the order in space-time . The primordial fireball became more real to him than the violence of his own birth , the question of what had brought it about became as terrifying . With it , he bought the spirals of the galaxies and the DNA molecule with energy which would never come back to him , and saw how it aged as it matured , even as you and I ; the Law is One . He lived the lives of stars : how manifold were the waves that formed them , how strong the binding afterward to an entire existence ' Amidst the massiveness of blue giants and black holes , he found room to forge planets whereonp196crystals and flowers could grow . He beheld what was still unknown  --  the overwhelming most of it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questing . Yet throughout , the observer part of him sensed that beside hers , his perception was misted and his understanding chained . When she drew him back to the flesh , he screamed . They sat in the office . Her desk separated them . She had raised the blind on the window at her back and opened it . Shadows hastened across grass , sunlight that followed was bright but somehow as if the air through which it fell had chilled it , the gusts sounded hollow that harried smells of damp soil into the room , odors of oncoming autumn . She spoke with all her gentleness . " We could n't have talkedmeaningfully before you 'd been there yourself , could we have , Eric ? " His glance went to the empty couch . " How meaningful was anythingbetween us , even at first ? " She sighed . " I wanted it to be . " A smile touched her . " I did enjoy . " " No more than that , enjoy , eh ? " " I do n't know . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taught me about . But I 've gone on to , to where I tried to lead you . " " How far did I get ? " She stared down at her hands , folded on the desk in helplessness , and murmured , " Still less than I feared . It was like showing a blind man a painting . He might get a tiny idea through his fingertips , texture , the dark areas faintly warmer than the light  --  but oh , how tiny ! " " Whereas you respond to the lot , from quanta to quasars , " he rasped . She raised her head , challenging their shared unhappiness . " No , I 've barely begun , and of course I 'll never finish . But do n't you see , that 's half of the wonder . Always more to find . Direct experience , as direct as vision or touch or hunger or sex , experience of the real reality . The whole world humans know is just a passing , accidental consequence of it . Each time I go to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more its own . How could I stop ? " " I do n't suppose I could learn ? " She knew he cherished no hope . " No . A holothete has to start like me , early , and do hardly anything else , especially in those formative young years . " Her eyes stung . " I 'm sorry , darling . You 're good and kind and .. . how I wish you could follow along . How you deserve it . "  | " You do n't wish you could go back , though , to what you were when we : net ? " " Would you ? " He could never truly summon up what had happened this day . I lowever  --  " No , " he said . " In fact , I dare not try again . That could be addictive . For me , nothing but an addiction , and to lunacy . For you  --  " He shrugged . " Do you know the Rubaiyat ? " " I 've heard of it , " she said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " lie recited : Why , if the Soul can fling the Dust aside , And naked on the Air of Heaven ride , Were't not a Shame  --  were't not a Shame for himIn this clay carcass crippled to abide ? She nodded . " The old man told truth , did n't he ? I did read once that c ) uiar was a mathematician and astronomer . He must have been lonely . " " Like you , Joelle ? " " I have a few colleagues , remember . I 'm teaching them  --  " She broke off , leaned across the desk , and said in a renewed concern : " What about us Iwo ? We 'll be collaborating . You 're strong enough to carry on , discharge your duty , I 'm certain you are . But our personal lives  --  What 's best for you ? " " " Or for you ? Let 's take that up first . " " Anything you want , Eric . I 'll gladly be your wife , mistress , anything . " I le @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  that might not hurt her . None came . " You 're telling me that you do n't care which , " he said . " You 're willing to treat me as well as you 're able , because it does n't greatly matter to you . " He raised a palm to check her response . " Oh , no doubt you 'd get a limited pleasure from living with me , even from my conversation . If nothing else , I 'd help fill in the hours when you ca n't be linked ... until you and those allows of yours go so far that you 'll have broke loose . I le sighed . " I believe you . It 's simply that love is n't important any more , beside that grandeur . I 've felt affection for dogs I 've kept . But  --  call it pride , Ict jccdice , stubbornness , what you will  --  I ca n't play a dog 's part . " He rose . " We 'll doubtless have an efficient partnership till I go home , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something remains of her , I 'll tell my girlnlhye. "  |p198She  sought him . He held her while she wept . But when at length she kissed him , her lips were quite steady . " Go back to your link for a bit , " he counselled her . " I will , " she answered . " Thank you for saying it . " He walked out into a wind gone cold at evening . She stood in the doorway and waved . He did n't turn around to see . Maybe he did n't want to know how soon the door closed on her.  |p199'I'iE  NEWCOMERS were naturally much in demand aboard Chinook . Itwas thus a small surprise to Weisenberg when Rueda Suarez invited him to atop by for a drink before dinner . Entering at the agreed time , the engineer heard a folk song from the Andean altiplano throbbing at low volume and saw that the reader was screening a page of verse . Rueda followed his glance . " Garcia Lorca , " the Peruvian said . " I am pleased to find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , him , Neruda , Cervantes , everyone , not to speak of music . " " Well , we planned against possible years of being away , the same as you did , " Weisenberg answered . " Moreover , like you we hoped we 'd be showingsome of the human culture to nonhumans . " " Years . .. in your case , sir ? Are you not married ? " " Yes , with five good kids . But the youngest is starting in the university , the rest are entirely on their own . Sarah was slated to come along on the expedition , quartermaster . Of course , when we had to scramble as we did , I ' ' would n't let her . " Weisenberg chuckled , though pain stirred beneath . " More accurately , I did n't tell her  --  I skipped out , leaving a message  --  because a person needs a nice safe black hole to shelter in when Sarah gets her Jewish up . " " I see . Wo n't you sit down ? What would you like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the stores . " " Scotch , then , thank you . Neat ; water chaser . " Weisenberg folded hisleanness into a chair . Rueda poured the same for both and settled opposite . " I thought we should get a little acquainted , " the host said . " In hours we will be at the T machine , and God alone knows what willhappen . If Daniel 's scheme succeeds and we reach Beta , we still have a long , hard effort before us . If it does not , we may well be in instant danger of ourp200lives . We had better know the ways in which we can depend on one another . And ... perhaps you can find duty for me . I feel useless , I worry , I drink too much . " His smile was rather sour . " Frieda might keep me occupied , but she 's exploring the new men around her . " Weisenberg took a smoky sip . " Ca n't you ask the skipper for a job ? " " I hate to add to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expert . If you could give me a suggestion for me to make to him  --  do you see ? You and I may communicate better than most . I heard you spent years in Peru , working for Aventureros . " Weisenberg nodded . " I studied nuclear engineering in Lima . There was no school of it then on Demeter . Afterward , yes , I did take a job with your company . That was what got me hooked on being in space . But I loved the city too . It 's beautiful , and gave me many glorious moments . I was there when the Covenant was signed ! " " Why did you return , if you do n't mind telling me ? " " Oh , mainly for my parents ' sake . It was not easy working groundside , though raising a family kept me reasonably cheerful . When Dan started Chehalis , I jumped into his employ . " Rueda stared at his tumbler , drank , and stared again , as if it held an omen . " Space , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us be obsessed with space , no ? Why else would we be here ? I think I was first caught in boyhood , on a cold and brilliant night at Machu Picchu . The stars above the Incan ruins were like a host of angels . " " Or of Others , " Weisenberg said as softly . Rueda gave him an examining look . " Are you among those who make the Others into God ? " " No , not really . " The conversation was becoming intimate fast ; but only forty hours of peace remained . " However , I went to Neo-Chasidic rabbinical school in Eopolis . A man can bear the marks of that his whole life , no matter if the faith has gone . " " Well , I am a Catholic of sorts , I think , but I must admit those years at Beta made me wonder a lot . Until then , I 'd almost taken the Others for granted . But when the Betans , with their fantastic capabilities , turned out to be mortal and troubled , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Others , the same as us  --  yes , it upset a great deal in me . " Rueda grimaced . " I was a political conservative too . Now I see how things I never dreamed of have been infecting government , and that faith also shakes . " He knocked back his whisky . " It continues possible to believe in the power , wisdom , and benevolence of the Others . May it always continue possible . " Having taken a sip of water , he lifted the liquor bottle off the table beside him and made an offering gesture toward Weisenberg . The engineer shookp201his head . Rueda glugged forth a refill for himself and started on it . " I am not a cultist about them , " Weisenberg said . " For instance , I do not believe they are working secretly to guide us and the whole universe . Maybe they are , but their Voice denied it , also to the Betans . By and large , I 'm agnostic about them , and will stay that way till we get some direct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Still , they are important to your soul , " Rueda observed . Weisenberg nodded anew . " Fundamental . Especially when I 'm watching the sky in space . Though they probably do not play at being gods , it does seem impossible  --  well , impossible for me to accept , at least  --  that they 're indifferent to us ... that they let us use their gates merely because we ca n't hurt anything of theirs , and show us a single path to a new planet in idle kindliness , like a man feeding pigeons bits of a sandwich he is n't going to eat . No , obviously they did , somehow , study us closely before ever Fernandez-Davila left Earth . Can they since have lost interest in us ? " " They may have gone elsewhere , " Rueda said . " Remember , nobody , including the Betans , nobody has seen a ship of theirs . " " Maybe they keep their ships invisible . Maybe they do n't need ships . It does not make sense they would abandon those T @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  or , I 'm certain , that they would abandon us . I can easily imagine they keep out of our sight . We could be overcome by their presence , crushed . But damn it , they must be benign . They must care . " " This is a big galaxy . Apparently millions of intelligent races , or billions . Could they spare the time ? " " If they can build T machines around  --  how many suns ?  --  they can follow what happens on the planets . " " Like God ? His eye is on the sparrow . ' " " Oh , the Others hardly have infinite powers . We might not be able to tell the difference , though . " Rueda turned grim . " They 're not doing much in the way of helping us , aboard this ship , are they ? " " They never passed any miracles for individual benefit that I heard of , " Weisenberg admitted . " I 've tried and tried and failed and failed to guess what their relationship is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only convinced to the marrow that they do care  --  that the Voice did n't lie when it said they love us . " It was time to prepare yet another meal . Caitlin entered the common room on her way to the galley , and stopped short . The alien ... the Betan ... Fidelio stood , or sat , or squatted , or poisedp202before one of the big viewscreens , staring out . Interior lighting dimmed the sky for her eyes , but she saw the Milky Way stream past his head . He was alone . " Oh , " she blurted . " Good day to you . " Though he did n't glance around , he answered in a hoarseness that whistled , " Buenos dias , senora Mulryan . " Caitlin went to Spanish . " Do you know me , then , already , not even looking ? " " My race has ears more keen than yours . " Without practice , a gifted hearing was necessary to follow most of what Fidelio said . But he spoke fluently and grammatically . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ utter sounds of this kind . As if realizing he might have been too curt , he went on : " Each individual has a distinct odor , too . This is something else you are not evolved to notice . However , your eyesight in air is much better at long range than mine , and I can only helplessly admire your tactile sensitivity . " He turned , now , in a single fluid motion  --  light gleamed along his fur  --  to confront her . She strode across the deck until she stood before him . " I like your smell , " she said . " It brings me back to my homeland , and me a child at play where the sea made the shingle grind together like millstones . . . but it 's different enough , too , that I am also a child at dream on the same shore , seeing fairyland in the clouds .... Pardon . You could not understand that . " " Perhaps I could . My folk too have myths and phantoms , which are strongest in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clawed paws , because his own hands were further back , gripped their knobbliness , and said gladly : " I was sure of it . But I did n't know you would be so learned about us . To recognize a word like fairyland ' ! " " My work has been with other sapient species . That aids me in guessing what might matter to yours . " The altogether blue gaze grew intent upon her . " I own to being surprised at your immediate comprehension of me . My accent seemed much too thick for everyone who is not off Emissary . " Caitlin disengaged and shrugged . " Well , I collect songs in several languages . " The big brown form reared up , the whiskers quivered . " Do you mean that you sing , yourself ? And not formal music , such as the expedition 's people played for me , but an ordinary kind ? " " Why , did they never sing ? " " Yes , once in a while , but  --  " Fidelio hesitated . " I remarked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grinned . " I know what you are trying to be tactful about . Well , ifp203nonetheless you got interested in our music , from recordings  --  I 'd never call myself an outstanding performer , but  --  " " Good day , " said a new voice . Fidelio had no need to see who spoke . Caitlin did . Joelle Ky stood in the main doorway . " Oh , good day , senora ! " Caitlin made haste to give her a soft salute . " Can I be doing anything for you ? " " No . I happened by . " The holothete held her lean form as rigid as her tone . " We were starting a chat  --  " " This is the first member of this crew with whom I can freely talk , " Fidelio explained . " Wo n't you join us , Dr. Ky ? " Caitlin asked timidly . " No , " the other woman said . Her countenance was likewise frozen . " What could I contribute ? Do carry on , Senorita Mulryan . Dinner can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fidelio 's experience of ... humanity . " She strode from sight . Caitlin stared at the space where she had been . The Betan 's query jerked her attention back to him : " Is there conflict between you two ? " " No . I never  --  that is  --  " Caitlin drew breath . " After all , we have barely met , she and I. Of course , I knew about her , and was in awe , and hoped  --  " She half sighed , half shuddered , then squared her shoulders . " A conflict is possible anyhow , " she admitted . " Captain Brodersen has told me a few things . She may resent my closeness to him . But I 'm sure this is completely foreign to you . " Did Fidelio hunch over , as if defensive ? " Have you not understood ? We want this kind of thing not to be foreign to us . " " Well , yes  --  " Caitlin stammered . " I suppose  --  I 've heard  --  It 's stunningly strange , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go past her lashes . " What you hoped would be an opening to love has become one to hatred and dread . Oh , my poor dear ! " She rallied . " We 're bound for what 's better , " she said . " Dan Brodersen will see to that . Meanwhile , it would be wise if you come to know humans besides the few who went to your planet . We do differ very much . Surely some among us can help you . Also , getting acquainted will lift everyone 's minds off the loss we 've suffered and the desperate action a few days hence . " Again she took hold of him , this time by the hands , since he had reached those out . " Let me be your guide . I can interpret , yes , and arrange small get-togethers and try to keep things cheery . We all need that . " " Many thanks , " he replied . " You are kind . " Still he stood bent , and his words came mechanical . Caitlin observedp204him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glad for a moment , " she murmured at last , " but that has fled you . " He made a noise that might correspond to a sigh . " It is nothing you can do anything about , senorita . And , if we win free , it will soon be cured . " " Do you care to tell me what ? " " I am a holothete , like Joelle Ky , and long out of the ... the state of communion . You have heard it becomes vital to us , or at least to our happiness . " Fidelio lifted his head . " No matter . It is no worse for me than for her . " " But you are among aliens ! " Caitlin cried . " And we have the equipment aboard , but it could not fit you , could it ? Why , you must be miserable ! " She flung herself against the massive , warm body and hugged him . He touched her in shy response . " Listen , Fidelio , " she said when they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is useless . You can set your trouble aside for a bit . You were doing so when we got interrupted . Let 's go back to where we were then . Music . You 'd like to hear our songs , and I 'd be overjoyed to hear yours . " Briskly : " Now I must prepare the food , but there 's no reason why we ca n't be singing the while . " He stirred , straightening . Life returned to his voice . " Yes , please , let us . Could I assist you in your work ? " For the first time since they left the Wheel , she laughed . " What is it ? " he asked . " Oh . .. thank you .... Maybe you could carry a few things . But I was remembering a primitive cottage in Ireland , and seeing you at the kitchen sink wielding a dish towel . " As if a weight had fallen off her , Caitlin danced toward the galley . While she did , she commenced his education . La cucaracha @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Frieda von Moltke 's breath came warm and musky . " That was good . You are very good . " Martti Leino opened his eyes to the round , wide-nosed , full-mouthed countenance below his . He was not tall ; she was ; she had readily been able to kiss him on his lips and inside them till it began to crest in her . Then she roared , and it was like riding an earthquake . Her arms and thighs still clasped him . Sweat glued strands of yellow hair to the slightly florid brow and cheeks ; he felt the same moisture against his belly.  | " You too , " he said . " I had fun , and I surely needed some . Thank you . " She laughed . " We are not done yet , my friend . Howeffer , what about a beer first ? And do you mind if I smoke ? " " No . I do n't myself , but no . " He rolled off her and propped himself on his pillow at the headboard . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not fat , save for the huge breasts ; solid . Crossing her cabin , she took a cheroot from a box  --  the ship was stocked for a variety of minor vices  --  and put it between her teeth before she dealt with the bottles . Returning , she paused at the bedside . Her regard of him grew speculative . " Martti , " she asked , " why did you close your eyes after we began ? " He moved them from her . " Habit , " he mumbled . " I think not . We could haff turned the lights off if you wanted . You were using effery sense , until  --  Did you decide to pretend I was somebody else ? " " Please ! " " Oh , I am not offended if so . We are not in luff . I do n't want to pry , either . I am just curious . " He kept silent . She handed him a flask , which chill had already bedewed , and lit her tobacco . Smoke eddied acrid . She joined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I like you much , I belieff , Martti , " she told him . Slyly : " I expect you will compare well with your shipmates . Stefan Dozsa is nice but  --  hasty ? Maybe not promising . I am not sure of making the other two at all . Weisenberg acts thoroughly married when we talk , and Brodersen has his mistress , who is far prettier than me . " Leino scowled . " Yes , he does . " Once more Frieda 's gaze grew thoughtful . " She is a delightful person . Gifted ; she was singing a few of her own songs while she took measurementsto make me some decent clothes . And she runs a splendid galley . And seems to handle the rest of the quartermaster job well . What else ? " " I ca n't say . " Leino spoke fast . " I have n't known her long . Yes , she is quite a girl . " Abruptly , twisting about to confront her : " Tell me about yourself , Frieda . Everybody 's been lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . Now we have hardly any time left before  --  Well , what has your life been ? " The gunner shrugged and blew a smoke ring . " I half knocked around . " " Tell me . " " If you will then tell me your story . " " Mine is n't much , " Leino said . " I 'm such a young fellow  --  I 'm beginning to find out how young  --  You 've seen more . " She collected bottle and cigar in her right hand , that the left might rumple his hair . " You are cute , Martti. "  |p206Relaxing  into her pillow : " Well , an outline , if you want . I was born in East Prussia thirty years ago , except for me it has been thirty-eight .

" I would like to marry , and get my immunityrefersed , to haff children while my parents can still enjoy being grandparents . If they are a life . . . and we may be headed into death ourselfs . " " Yes , it 's hard waiting helpless , is n't it ? " " Oh , that is the usual fate of humans . You wait for the medical lab results or the jury 's verdict or how the next shell will fall on a battlefield or  --  whateffer . " Freida sucked her cheroot into an Aldebaran redness at its end .

They will fear the Betans or somebody might come , and for that reason work to get control , until they can openly put weapons at the Sol and Phoebus T machines for keeping a hermit kingdom . It is too possible . My folk remember the Soviets . " " Unless the Others intervene , " Leino said . " Is that altogether a daydream ? Did you get the least clue in Emissary ? " Frieda 's expression sharpened . " No . What sign besides the Voice did the Others effer giff us ... or the Betans , or any uff those races the Betans know ? " She swigged her bottle dry , dropped it clunking to the deck , and struck fist upon knee . " Martti , I do not like thinking about the Others . We did for eight years .

Brains likewise , I suppose , but do brains count for that much ? I would n't be surprised but what our holothetes are as intelligent as them ; or more , even . If they are angels , as ourp207pastor in my home town thinks they might be , or if they 're simply free from original sin , then why did they let the Troubles happen ? And the heresies , the wild cults that center on them ? Could they actually be damned , or be outright demons ? I do n't know , I do n't know .

" I need a rest . " She reached for him . " I am certain you will find you haff more capability than anybody showed you before . " Pause ; calculation ; stab : " Caitlin Mulryan can do likewise , or I miss my guess . " Seeing him wince : " Neffer mind . A joke . You are a dear sweet man . Let us enjoy this short while before we enter the gate . " Again he closed his eyes.  |p208TODAY  IRA QUICK held off Toronto 's winter by a recording , played on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ static but moved slowly around the delicate facades , soaring and intricate vaults , glowing windows of that loveliest of medieval churches . Tuned down to bare audibility , yet losing none of its might , a Gregorian chant gave background . The show was a reminder of what man , Earthbound and alone , had achieved : the heritage now menaced by inhumanness . It strengthened him in his resolution . Simeon Ilyitch Makarov , premier of Great Russia , sat across from his desk . He had flown here incognito at Quick 's urgent request . " You are the most powerful individual in our group , " the North American had said , " and the two of us are the most determined . We 're at a crisis point , I 'm afraid ; we have to confer and decide . I should n't be more specific over the phone , scrambler or no . And I ca n't come to you . All my present lines of communication center on this office . " Arrived , Makarov lit an atrocious cigarette , inhaled hard , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you to report ? " He was a stocky individual with a walrus mustache and thin gray hair , his garb unfashionable and rumpled , a survivor of combat in the civil wars which had sundered his country , his existence ever since consecrated to its eventual reunification . " No knowledge you do n't already possess . You 're as well aware as I that Chinook is approaching the T machine , scheduled to arrive in about three hours . That 's why I must stay put . Someone has to give new orders in case something unforeseen happens . " Quick slapped his palm down . " Christ ! Transmission time of more than twenty minutes ! "  | " Yes , our group agreed you are best positioned to take that responsibility . Why do you suddenly want me to share it ? " " You do in any case , Sr. Makarov . " Quick frowned . " There is one new development , I hope unimportant . I learned about it while you were on your way . I 've been kept personally informed about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ project of mine is supposed to be going on there is sufficient excuse . Troxell does n't send any details by laser , of course , but he is supposed to beam a periodic All 's well ' signal . It 's overdue . " " That could be bad ! " " Or it could be plain carelessness . He 's grown less than punctual ; the isolation , the strain are getting to him and his men . I do n't think I should send an immediate inquiry  --  too conspicuous , makes me look too concerned  --  right when Chinook demands my total care . " Quick paused before he added weightily : " And yet analysis of radar data shows the ship used quite a peculiar , uneconomical boost pattern to get onto the path we required . It had her effectively in the radar shadow of the Wheel  --  given that astronomical distance , plus the electromagnetic shielding  --  for hours . " Makarov grunted as if struck . " Why did you not tell the rest of us at once ? " Quick sighed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sir , we , I must proceed with caution . As is , too many people are involved . If I call for information on a top priority basis , they will speculate why . If I lay stress on a particular question , they will speculate further . " " Hunh ! I 've gotten things better organized in Great Russia . " " That 's a major reason why you are so valuable , so critical to our effort , " you barbarian tyrant . " Precisely how much information has leaked , what kind , and to whom ? " Quick spread his hands . " Precisely ' is an impossible requirement . I am , as I said , not dealing with a handful of disciplined men like yours , whose silence is guaranteed . I 've done my best to keep you au courant , as well as I can follow events myself . " " Yes . I do , though , have many different matters claiming my attention . Suppose you summarize for me , whether or not you have already described a specific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is he , underneath a peasant shrewdness , basically a dullard ? This is n't what I need him for today .... I do need him . I must oblige . Maybe , several years hence  --  Quick arrayed the facts in his head and began :  | " Our original group knows the full story , of course . That includes those subordinates we have co-opted . " Among them were the entire crew of the watchship Lomonosov , most of them newly assigned , which had gone ahead to wait at the Phoebean T machine for Chinook to arrive . They were either veterans of Makarov 's , who entered space service after the wars but remained devoted to their old leader , or else technically trained covert agents of his . Quick had had to admire how swiftly the premier arranged this when appealed to . The Astronautical Control Board had been grateful to have the arrangement made on its behalf , especially at such short notice . Now Bohr need not leave her station to escort the vessel of wanted men off to detention . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ team . The pretext , which the psychologists themselves bought , was trying to find out how spacemen react to peculiar occurrences . Apparently none of them suspect the truth , though they do wonder about the incident . No serious problem , I 'd say . " Dyson was the watchship at the Solar portal when Emissary returned to the Phoebean System . Quick almost wished he had a God to thank , that Tom Archer , captain of Faraday , guardian craft at the other end of the gate , was smart as well as loyal . He 'd sent a pilot fish ahead , asking Dyson to come through and lend emergency assistance ; then he shepherded Emissary in the opposite direction . Finding no one at the Solar System exit , as he had hoped , he instantly led his captive off to a safe distance and got in touch with Quick . By the time Dyson returned , the minister had a message ready for the puzzled captain  --  apologies and all that , but it had suddenly proved necessary to transfer a certain load in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that extremist elements on Earth or Demeter ought to know about . " Faraday is much more difficult , but I need n't repeat that , need I ? " Archer and his mate were sworn to the cause , but it had not been feasible to hand-pick the rest of that crew . Those persons had inevitably rejoiced at the reappearance of Emissary and had made a fuss over leading her into quarantine not as a public health precaution but as if she were an enemy . After consultation with his masters , the captain told his men , in effect , " It turns out she may really have brought back something dangerous  --  maybe not , but the goverment wants to investigate thoroughly and cautiously , and meanwhile does not want public hysteria . So to make dead sure of preserving security , we 're off to Hades on a scientific assignment . " Fast and versatile , watchships often did serve as exploratory vessels ; and the outermost world in the Phoebean System did have curious features about which the planetologists would like to know more . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and friends you expected to see before long , but orders arep211orders . They 'll be reassured we 're all right . And we 'll collect fat pay for the extra duty , remember that . "  --  Faraday would not stay out there forever . " Troxell and his agents may be a larger hazard still , " Quick proceeded . " No matter how carefully we chose them , they 've been exposed for weeks on end to some damnably persuasive pro-stellar arguments . If one or two of them should be converted ... they could ruin us the same day they set foot back on Earth . " Those are the obvious people to worry about . We have plenty of less obvious . They run the whole gamut from my assistant Chauveau or Zoe Palamas , for example , whom I 've fed forebodings about incipient rebellion on Demeter , down to technicians in space stations who were asked to locate Chinook and transmit the command to her that she return home . " Sir , the situation is precarious and worsening . I 'm less and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I must have strong help . Of our whole group , you can best supply that . " Makarov stubbed his cigarette viciously before he sent it down the ashtaker and reached for another . " What would you have me do , this exact hour ? " he growled . Quick sighed . " If I knew that , sir , I probably would n't have had to call on you . The truth is , though , what will happen soon is unpredictable . If matters go wrong , I may well be unable to maintain secrecy alone . Nor was I ever used to doing so to this extent . Your advice , your connections , your action  --  Do you follow me ? " Suppose everything does proceed as we hope . Chinook comes to theT machine , obediently maintaining outercom silence . The regular watchship is Copernicus , the hastily dispatched special one is Alhazen . Crews of both have been warned that the travelers are wanted on Demeter on criminal charges and must be presumed dangerous . Additionally , Broussard of the European Confederacy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alhazen , though not privy to the facts , are men who can be depended on to obey his command to shoot when in any doubt ; his national government will protect them afterward before the board of inquiry .... However , suppose Chinook passes through to Phoebus withoutincident . There Lomonosov waits to conduct her off . When remote from Bohr , Lomonosov sends a boarding party which secures the Demetrians , interrogates them , communicates with Governor Hancock , and waits for further instructions . " We still wo n't know for a while exactly what the Brodersen gang has done or can still do . We may get a nasty surprise . For instance , they may have propagandized the Wheel . We had better be prepared to respond fast and decisively.  | " For now , though , what if trouble comes in the next few hours , in any of a hundred unforeseeable ways ? What then ? I repeat , sir , events are moving too rapidly for us . We 've had to improvise , we 're overextended , our cover stories are full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Wheel and back  --  will shortly be asking too many questions . What shall we do ? " Makarov blew smoke . It stank . " That will depend on what the reality is , " he said . " You are right , I had best keep vigil with you . " After a moment he added : " The absolute reality is always death . " Quick sat straight . I half feared this . Did 1 also half wish for it ? " I do n't quite understand , " he faltered . " Do they not have a proverb in English , Dead men tell no tales ' ? " Yes ; and how many graves have your executioners filled , Makarov ? Quick 's mouth was turning cottony . He felt cold , though the office was well heated . " We have ... our group has ... discussed extreme measures , true . But strictly in case of dire need . " " You have been telling me the need has become dire  --  whether you know you have or not . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Perhaps you should be more specific , sir . " Makarov waved his cigarette . " Very well . " His tone stayed matter-offact . " I have given thought to this , you realize , and have sounded out others in our team . If you were not included , no insult . Your actions , yes , your leadership demonstrate you are fundamentally a realist . " We can have Chinook and her crew destroyed . We can send a trustworthydetachment to dispatch the personnel in the Wheel , including Troxell 's . " Faraday  --  I am not yet sure . We can have Lomonosov destroy her at Hades . Later we can explain these losses as a sad set of accidents , coincidentally happening in close succession . Well , there is no haste about Faraday . If possible , I prefer we spare her , since her crew is primed with hints of monsters from the stars . " Ideally , we arrange the scene at the Wheel so it appears the monsters , who had enslaved the Emissary crew , took over the quarantine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his private investigation , they lured him to them , captured him and his men , departed in his ship for their planet . Fortunately , they betrayed themselves to the alert Lomonosov , which blew them to pieces . " Despite having entertained similar notions  --  as fantasies , as fantasies  --  Quick felt it incumbent on him to whisper , " Do you seriously imagine we could get the whole human race to swallow such a piece of sensationalism ? "  | " Enough of it , probably , " Makarov said . " Nothing a government claims is too preposterous for most of its citizens . " Bear in mind , I do not say this strategy is feasible . That we must find out . For example , will Stedman cooperate fully ? His nerve may fail him when he imagines facing his God . If he or somebody else becomes unreliable , what can we best do about them ? In any event , how do we explain and justify the fact that so many in the Council , in higher echelons everywhere , were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we manufacture , what particulars can clever men invent for us ? " The advantage of creating invaders from the stars is that we can then easily attain our objective , a guard at both T machines to wipe out any alien ships the instant they appear . Public opinion will support this , yes , require this , and an end to exploration . But we do risk failure and exposure . " Maybe the safest course is to destroy Faraday with the rest and make everything look accidental . Or , hm , we could throw some of the blame onto terrorists . In that case , we must find a different political route , more slow , toward our goal . " The whole point , Sr. Quick , is that whatever we do , it must not be done timidly . We must have the balls to accept great hazards . Believe me , the danger in shilly-shallying is grossly greater . " Yes , I must certainly stand by you in these next hours , " Makarov closed . " You 're saying terrible things , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 'd kill have been freely helping us . " " I have heard another English proverb , " Makarov retorted . " ' You can not make an omelette without breaking eggs . ' Is an excellent saying . " In the past I have found it necessary to sign death sentences of followers who had been valuable . I judged they were beginning to follow me too independently ; or they had questionable associates ; or  --  Well , I had a state to rebuild from chaos . How could I investigate every single case ? " For our separate reasons , Sr. Quick , we deem it vital that the human race stay home , carry out its natural tasks , and shun outsiders ... at least until it is properly organized to cope with them . Vital . Now in days before cell therapy , what woman hesitated to have a cancerous breast cut off ? That harmed her beauty , but she had no choice if she would live , did she ? " Furthermore , Sr. Quick . " Makarov leaned forward . " Furthermore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We had an ideal , we stumbled toward it , we made missteps as people always do , and today we are close to ruin . Is our ideal not correct regardless ? How well can we continue to serve mankind from a prison ?  | " Prison it will be , if any strong hint of the facts ever comes out . Publicity will lead to investigation . Subordinates of ours will seek to save their own hides by tattling on us . Chinook is forcing us beyond the limits of any legal technicalities . We are quite clearly conspiring to violate the Covenant rights of her crew . We have already violated them , by deliberately causing a groundless warrant to be issued for their arrest . From this will spring countless further charges of malfeasance in office . We will be locked away for a long , long time  --  unless we strike the right blow at once , and strike it hard ! " A part of Quick recalled an essay he had read years before , on how intellectuals are chronically fascinated by violence as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they might be to the idea of sexual relations with a barely pubescent girl or with a sentient nonhuman ; it is a kind of xenophilia , and when a conflict of which they approve ( and they approve of most ) does erupt , they take the lead in cheering on the warheads and calling for more soldiers to feed the furnace . At the time he had thought what reactionary nonsense this was . Later , cultivating his fair-mindedness , he had had to admit there might be a limited amount of truth to the thesis . Yonder son of a bitch is right in the present context . You ca n't make an omelette without breaking eggs . Why , you ca n't maintain an orderly everyday society without breaking an occasional head . And , Christ almighty , he must indeed go forward . Otherwise  --  arrest , indictment , trial ? An actual jail sentence ? A rehabilitative psychiatrist ( squat , plump , blue-jowled , fleshy-nosed ) probing the psyche of Ira Quick , which his grubby breed would never understand in a geological @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to whatever drabness he could find in the wreckage of career and social life ? His boys , wife , friends , mistresses , the whole world naming him kidnapper and murderer , he who had striven for nothing but human betterment ? I am well known as being fast on my feet . Quick ran tongue over lips . " Sir , I do n't necessarily agree with either of your proposals . " Ah , good , how calmly he spoke despite the thick hammering inside him . " Nevertheless , when a statesman like you speaks , I listen . Would you care to explain in detail ? " He felt his brave smile . " We do have to pass the time while we wait . " The voices around the cathedral image were marching to their triumphant conclusion.  |p215Chinook  WAS OVER a million kilometers from her goal , decelerating , when the first communication struck her . Brodersen took it in his office . The screen showed him an angular visage speaking British English : " Vincent Lawes , commanding watchship A lhazen on special duty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " It was scarcely a question . " Give me your captain . " " You have him , " Brodersen answered . " What can I do for you ? " The seconds ticked away while light beams flew forth and back again . Caitlin , seated beside Brodersen , gripped his forearm , which was bare . He was acutely conscious of that warmth and pressure , of her hasty breath and faint sweet woman-odors . " Now hear this well , Captain Brodersen , " Lawes said . His tone was harsh and a tic jumped near his right eye . " You are wanted on serious charges . Your ship is armed . My orders are to see that you pass through to the Phoebean System to be taken in charge there . I am to consider you dangerous and take no chances with you . None . Do you understand ? " " What procedure shall we follow ? " Time . " You will maneuver as usual , except under direction from us , not Copernicus . In fact , you are to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ message at us , and in English . Copernicushas been directed off her usual orbit . She 'll keep on the far side of the T machine from you as you make transit . To contact her , you 'd have to broadcast  --  and in Spanish , since nobody aboard her knows English . We will detect that . Any untoward action of yours can provoke our fire . I repeat , do you understand ? Make sure you do , Captain Brodersen . " " My , my . " The Demetrian clicked his tongue . " You are tight in the sphincter , are n't you ? How come ? What harm in a little chat ? "  |p216Time  . Caitlin chanted , a whisper  --  a Gaelic curse , Brodersen thought . " I have my orders , " Lawes replied , scissoring off each word . " Among other things , you stand accused of trying to disseminate technological information which would endanger public safety . Without questioning the dutifulness of the Copernicus personnel , I am to see that you send no word to them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to tune you in . If we become engaged with you , they will join us . " " I see . M-m , how about yourself , Captain Lawes ? Our side of the story is pretty interesting . We 've quite a bit we can show you , too . " Time . The sole surprise , if it was that , was the appalled vehemence of Lawes ' " No ! Absolutely not ! At the first sign of any such attempt , I 'll switch off . If you persist when I call back later , I have discretion to attack . " " Okay , okay . What else ? " Time . Brodersen muttered to Caitlin , " They 've sure got to him , have n't they ? Prob'ly by more than an appeal to his loyalty . He 's an officer of the Union , after all , not of Europe . Bribe , blackmail  --  " " Your path and vectors are incorrect for a transit , " Lawes said . " Explain . " " Yeah , I was coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ control system . Acquired a wrong momentum and have to compensate . Instead of making straight for our first base , we 're applying parameters which will bring us to zero relative velocity near Beacon Bravo . From there , we 'll move to the proper location for a standard approach . I have the figures here , if you 'd like me to transmit them . " Discussion went into technicalities for several minutes . At last , reluctantly , Lawes said , " Very well . We will be tracking you continuously , remember . Stand by for possible further instructions . If nothing suspicious happens , I will re-establish direct communication at nineteen-thirty hours . Is that clear ? " Receiving his acknowledgment , he blanked without a goodbye . Biodersen leaned back . " Wow , " he said . " For a while there , I wondered if he would shoot . His finger 's awful twitchy on the trigger . But of course , at this distance , Frieda can intercept whatever he might send  --  I presume . " " It 's desperate our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Right . And the more desperate people get , the more dangerous . Us included . " He turned to smile at her . The darling face drew close to his . " Well , we 've three to four hours before things get spiny . Better rest up , macushla , if you can . " She ran fingers down his cheek . " I 've a more interesting idea , my life . " " Huh ? I  --  Look , I 've got to make the rounds , jolly the troops , check everything out  --  "  | " If those responsible have not their departments in good shape by now , you 're too late , " she said firmly . " They do , though . I 've sounded them out in ways the Old Man can not . The morale of most is flying banners ; the rest are at least of stout heart . Aye , we might hold an assembly , for a few rousing songs of revolution and freedom . But that 's best done as late before our plunge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 've better than an hour free , Daniel Brodersen , and sure I am you 've the wit to pass it in style . " " Uh , well , uh , look , frankly , I 'm so full of worries , I doubt  --  " She stopped his lips with hers . Her hands roved . Presently she laughed . " See ? That fret of yours was for naught . " Springing to her feet , grabbing his wrist : " Come along , me bucko . No use to struggle . You 're doomed . " Stars blazed in every viewscreen of the command center . The dimmed image of Sol hung like a burning moon , Earth hidden from sight behind it . Elsewhere a globe glowed wanly golden , the sign at which the ship had halted . In another direction , the cylinder that was the T machine whirled , its mass and might brought by a tiny distance  --  about fifty megameters , hardly more than the circumference of a terrestroid planet  --  down to a bit of jewelry adrift in heaven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blood . Those tides went more easily than he had expected . He would not have taken a fear suppressant in any event , for he needed each millisecond he could shave off his reaction time , but he had figured on being strung tight . Pegeen is heap good medicine , he thought . If only she could be here . She would n't distract him ... willingly . He just was n't sure that in her nearness he could remain the complete robot he ought to be . It was plenty hard curbing the knowledge that soon she might ( lie . And Stef poised at detector and communicator consoles in the electronics shack ; Joelle as holothete and Su as linker were parts of the ship , le r pilots through the shoals and breakers ahead ; Phil and Martti occupied flee engine room , though likely they were condemned to do no more than sweat ; Frieda had the armament center , with Carlos  --  who had learned something about it earlier  --  to give partial assistance . That left Caitlin to omfort Fidelio . Tuning briefly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Betan . A blink and beep sent his attention to the outercom . Lawes ' haggard countenance jumped into its screen . " Watchship  --  there you are . Are you epared ? " " More or less , " Brodersen replied . " We 've still got problems . I do hopep218the apparatus does n't suddenly run wild . That could send us off to KingdomCome , you know . " Time lag here was imperceptible . Dozsa had reported A lhazen as being a few thousand kilometers off . Magnification could have made the lean shape visible , but Brodersen saw no cause to bother . " I . . . hope the same ... for your sake , " Lawes said . " Proceed according to your declared flight plan . I 'll stay in touch .... Proceed ! " " Yes . " Brodersen addressed the intercom . " Captain to crew . You heard the man . Get busy . " He saw Lawes flush and clench teeth , as if twice convinced this was a pack of pirates . Weightlessness yielded to a small , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Chinook rotated from her gyros . That stopped ; for an instant she orbited ; full thrust awoke and she darted forward . Acceleration crammed Brodersen into his seat . It took a minute for Lawes ' instruments and computers to determine what was going on and inform him . " Hold ! " he screamed . " You 're aimed wrong ! " " God damn it , I know , " Brodersen snapped in his best imitation of a person fighting dismay . " I told you we 're having troubles . Hang on , do n't bother me . " " What are you doing ? " " You think we want to go off on a random path and disappear forever ? Get off my back . I 've got to see about stopping us . " " I 'll give you a short chance , Captain . " Lawes clamped his mouth shut . Brodersen and his followers exchanged words which they had rehearsed . The ion drive cut out , as it must if Chinook was to tread the measure Joelle had calculated for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she turned her nose again . A radar could spot the movement if it was set to do so , but he gambled that that would n't occur to Lawes for a while . " Navigation estimates we can stay on this trajectory for six hours withoutgetting too far into the field , " he said . It was true . " The engineers expect they 'll repair the breakdown well before then . " Lawes squinched eyelids close together . " I want to know more about it . Why did n't you call in sooner ? " " Were n't we supposed to maintain silence ? We are n't actually criminals , Captain . We 're law-abiding citizens , anxious to get home and clear our names . How the hell we ever got accused of anything , I faunch to learn .... All right , if you wish , I 'll screen the pertinent parts of our log and the CE 's notes . " Those were works of art , Brodersen judged . Nevertheless he was fumblethumbedabout presenting them . His job as skipper was to talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible  --  keep his adversaries in play , while Joelle and Su and the laws of physics drove his ship onward . He had a mere twenty minutes or thereabouts of plausibility until the next acceleration fell due . His pilots would go at top speed , no safety margin to speak of , since every margin around them was beset .... A renewed boost . " Stop , Chinook ! Are you insane ? " " The controls are insane , that 's what . " " I ca n't believe this any longer . " " Ask your own CE to study the information we sent . Have him study it real hard . " Brodersen won that debate also . The drive had stopped and he hung as if at the bottom of a dream . Sweat off his face bobbed around in globules . Pegeen might likewise become glitter strewn among the stars . His underwear absorbed perspiration but left him chill and gamy . Time extended . Lawes reappeared in the screen . " My engineer says your material does not make sense , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must have been concocted . You 're attempting to escape . " " Escape into what ? " " Never mind . Brodersen , you will reverse immediately or we shoot . " He 's reacting on schedule , he is . " Wait , Captain Lawes . Wait half a tick . You 're about to compromise your mission and jeopardize your career . Take heed while you can . " " What are you raving about ? " " I 'm not raving . Please note I 'm speaking very carefully . " As slow and wordy as I gauge I can get away with . " Curb your own emotions and listen . You can spare a few minutes for saving your ass and maybe your superiors ' , ca n't you ? " " Well  --  " Lawes swallowed . " Go on . Speak to the point . " " I will . Okay , we lied to you , we bought ourselves time to get this far . It was necessary . The fact is , there 's a lot more behind our arrest than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No ! I have my orders ! " " It might n't be safe for you to know , eh ? Well , from our viewpoint , we 've zero to lose . If we go to Phoebus , the way things are , we 're dead . Jumping off into the galaxy , we have the teeniest chance of finding help somewhere . We do n't count on that , of course . But we 'll have several extra years of life while our supplies last . I do n't think this will bother your bosses much . If anything , they should be glad to get rid of us so cheaply . " " My orders say , either see you off to Phoebus or kill you . If you do n't return at once , you 'll not get an hour of those years you mention . "  | " We 're armed too , Captain . We can block your missiles for a bit . Meanwhilewe 'll broadcast  --  in Spanish , visual , at full power . Can you be certain they wo n't tune @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a different spacecraft ? We 've wattage aplenty to be received ten million kilometers off . It 's a story which will bring down some big people . In cases like that , little people get carried along .... I wish you would let me talk to you , Lawes . " " No . " Torment . " Have you anything further to say before we start shooting ? " " Why , yes . I have this suggestion . " Brodersen thrust his whole personality forward . " Call Earth and ask what to do . We 'll be zigzagging on , sure , but you 're aware of how long a proper transit pattern takes , and we 'd much rather come out in a planetary system , at a T machine , than in the middle of interstellar space . The best guess is , this means we have to pass from beacon to beacon  --  the more , the likelier  --  and swing straight inward from the last . You 've time for a call . Meanwhile , unless you shoot , we 'll stay quiet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bargain ! " " I am bargaining , though . Hear me . What I wish you 'd do is direct your message not to the office you 're supposed to , but to your own high command . Lay the matter before them . You 'll find them astonished at what 's been going on . " " We 're under security . " Brodersen sighed . He 'd expected nothing else . " Okay , as you choose . " Louder : " But call ! " After more argument he won his point . The screen blinked and he collapsed , breathing hard . It would take about three-quarters of an hour for an interchange , via the relay satellite , between here and Earth . By then , at her headlong pace , Chinook should be deep into the transport field . Stars exulted . He stirred and said through the intercom : " You heard that , boys and girls ? We 're this far along . Rejoice . " A few small cheers replied . Caitlin struck a ringing chord from her sonador and declared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No , you all did , " he answered . " Hey , Pegeen , I love you . " " Wait till I get you to myself again , " she said . Joelle is listening  --  By tacit agreement , conversation died away . Occasional words went around , most of them functional . Tastes in music varied too widely for a shared concert . Folk at their posts remained in their lonelinesses . Brodersen relived his latest passages with Caitlin ; the first had rated twelve on the Beaufort scale , the second had been as gentle as that final union , close to dawn , in the cave beneath Mount Lorn . . . . He evenp221dozed for a spell . The ship roused him , changing direction , squandering chemical auxiliaries as well as expending nuclear fuel in order to keep hard on her way . He was bobcat-alert before the response from Earth came due . Dozsa 's voice delivered it , a shout : " Missiles ! " The decision was , " Kill , " Brodersen realized . Quick , or whoever is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a plan . He must sit with nothing but fingernails in his fists . Survival had ceased to be any affair of his . At high accelerations , crossing the gap in a couple of minutes , though they changed vectors at varying intervals to confuse counterfire , the torpedoes homed on Chinook . Nobody aboard was spacesuited . If a nuclear warhead exploded near the hull , that was that . Brodersen spied the exhaust streaks , silver and narrow . Sensors locked onto the tubes . A computer extrapolated . Zarubayev had fine-tuned the system . Fire sprayed across darkness as energy-gorged laser beams found their targets . An " All clear " jubilated , telling humans they would not die in the next few seconds . The ship trembled . Von Moltke had launched missiles of her own . This was her ultimate job , to outguess a living opponent . Chinook was not only much bigger than Alhazen , she carried throw weight out of proportion . Watchships were n't really intended for battle . Their weapons were partly a relic of the Troubles , partly a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to entrench .... The vessel surged around Brodersen , plunging toward her next way station . Twinkles in heaven  --  " Gunner to captain , " von Moltke intoned , " they stopped our barrage . " " They were meant to , this first time , " he reminded her . " A lesson . Stef , have you got contact ? ... Okay , put me through . " His intention was to repeat his original threat , negotiate for the escape of his command . He did not , repeat and repeat not , wish to kill more men who were doing what they 'd been assured was their duty . The stars were beginning visibly to crawl in the viewscreens . Soon he 'd be in such warped space-time that no rocket would have a prayer of tracking him down . Of course , any signal he transmitted from there would be hopelessly garbled . Well , everybody would be satisfied , sort of " Missiles ! " Dozsa bawled . He spat an oath and rattled off RA , dec , approximate vectors . They had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my worst fear , that Quick 's influence would bep222strong enough to compel Janigian 's honest crew " Missiles ! " Those came from Alhazen , one , one , one , one , as fast as the tube could launch them . " Captain , " von Moltke said starkly , " I do not belieff we can strike that many in a flock . " Granville 's wail : " No , I compute we can not . Mon pere  --  " Joelle , like steel striking steel : " We can reach the next beacon and accelerate straight inward before they arrive . " Brodersen surged against his harness , even as weight returned . " No ! " hebawled . " We 'll end up anywhere  --  " Knowledge smote home . " Carry on . " The ship blasted . Almost , he imagined he saw the T machine growbefore him , whirling and whirling . He did see the first few splashes of flame , as Frieda parried . Then Sol was gone from its screen . The stars were an altogether different horde . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Centrum , but emberhuedand shrunken . Tawny beneath colored bands , thrice the width of Luna seen from Earth , stood a planet . Frighteningly close gyred a great iridescent cylinder . Brodersen let himself tumble for a minute into a night that roared . Winter fell downward , white around the tower in Toronto . " Well , " Quick said at last . " They 're gone . " " You are sure ? " Makarov demanded through a choking haze of smoke . He lacked the scientific education to follow each detail of what had just come in . " Yes , " Quick told him . " Whatever scheme they had  --  if they did  --  I suspect they were in fact running off at random , except for trying to . . . to maximize their probability of  --  Oh , how can you estimate it ? ... Never mind . They were forced to make their gate entry from the spot where they happened to be . They are gone , Makarov . I beg your pardon . They are gone , Premier Makarov @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ searching for new guidepaths . We can forget about them . " Makarov hunched his bulky frame . " You are quite certain ? " " Yes . Absolutely . " Quick sagged and covered his eyes . Exhaustion shuddered in him . " Ah . " Makarov puffed . " Good . What a simplification . " Quick looked back up . " Hm ? " Makarov smiled . He seldom did . " A factor less in the equation , perhaps the least known factor , do you see ? " I see you 're a mathematical illiterate , went through Quick.  |p223He  gathered strength together . A civilized man had better stay the equal of a barbarian war lord . " Right . We 'll have the personnel of Alhazen and Copernicus interrogated , of course , but apparently they heard nothing they should n't . This leaves us Lomonosov for any special missions we decide on  --  plus a welcome breathing space , I 'd say . " " We do not sit and pant much , " Makarov warned . " In the bright light of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notifying our major collaborators , I think we should send Lomonosov to the Wheel . If they find no undue complication , they dispose of those who are there , including Troxell 's group . Afterward we have leisure to make complete arrangements . Is this agreed ? " I 've had an inferno 's worth of hours to agonize over the moral issues , Quick thought . A time finally comes when the civilized man must attack alongside his ally of expediency , or be left behind and have no voice at the peace conference . " Sir , let 's sleep on it and then talk further , but at the moment I am inclined to believe that in principle you are right . "  |p224CAITLIN  FLOATED by herself in the common room . A handclasp on a table edge held her against air currents that made a cloud of her unbound hair . She had turned off lights , the better to see out the viewscreens . Like big windows , they gave her the encompassing universe . In most , stars crowded as ever before , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many that she could not see how heaven was altered ; nor did the argence of the Milky Way pour through channels greatly different from those above Earth or Demeter . In one direction the T machine was visible , but barely , a needle lost among vastnesses . Chinook had moved well clear of it before assuming a stable orbit around the planet . The strangeness stood to right and left of her . Right was the sun disc , one-sixth the width of that which shone upon her birthland . Its red glow needed no stopping down ; she could look straight at it , suffer nothing but after-images , and discern a faint , ocherous corona . She found no zodiacal lens , which turned the sight doubly foreign . Left was the giant world . The ship happened to have emerged opposite the dayside , and at her distance would need a pair of Terrestrial years to swing once around . Hence the globe stayed nearly at full phase , broad and bright enough to shine all else out of the screen which revealed it . Unaided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of amber shaded subtly into each other , below cloud belts that were deep or pale orange streaked by blue-green and auburn . The shadow of a moon was like the pupil of an eye . Where night sliced off a crescent , it was not wholly dark , but a faint sheen wavered . Mingled luminances turned the room into a cavern of soft lights and lairing shadows , a place of mystery and silence . The stillness did not break the moment Martti Leino entered . Hep225checked his flight in the doorway when he spied Caitlin and hung for a minute , staring at the slender , frosted form , before he almost barked , " Hello . " Tresses swirled in radiance and darkness as she pivoted on her arm . The free hand brushed a lock aside to clear sight for her . " Oh . The top of the morning to you , " she hailed , though in a hushed voice . " Morning  --  well , yes , our clocks do say eight hundred  --  as close to a morning as we 'll ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was looking for you . " " Were you that ? Why ? " He shoved from the doorframe , arrowed across to the table , caught it and let his body stream free like hers , directly across from her . This close to him , her face was clear in the shinings from outside , while shadows brought forth the sculpturing of it . His speech stumbled : " I noticed what trouble you were having at breakfast  --  " " Aye , weightlessness is grand until one must clean up and stash things , then it becomes a polka-dotted bitch . " While supplies did include plenty of squeeze-tube rations and other materials intended for these conditions , housekeeping for nine humans and a nonhuman got complicated even when the quartermaster was experienced . " Well , my ancestors outlived worse . Only think , I might have been a maidservant in a Victorian Protestanthome ! I 'll be learning the way of this . " " You should n't have to cope alone , now that Su will be too busy . I  --  I can help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be in hourly demand ? " " No . I 'll get jobs , of course , but  --  Oh , true , every spaceman 's trained to assist in some kind of research , and when we 've no proper scientists along  --  Well , the studies that our best qualified people can carry out wo n't need much support from me . Phil Weisenberg can generally handle the setting-up and so forth . I 've talked with him and he agrees I can probably be more useful , most of the time , helping you ... if you want , " Leino finished , dropping his glance . " Why , that 's dear of you and I thank you . " She reached to clasp his shoulder . " May the roads you take be always soft beneath your feet . " " We , we have to help each other ... be as kind to each other .. . as we can , " he mumbled . " Do n't we ? While we live ? There will never be any roads really for us , roads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smiled . " Sure , and you 're not losing heart already , are you , Martti , lad ? When we 've only just snatched our lives back to us and won free ? " " Free ? " His gaze swung wildly about , he gripped the table edge withneedless force , till his nails whitened . " Locked in a metal shell , blunderingp226blind through space as long as our food holds out , no longer , if we do n't go crazy first  --  " He wrestled for control . She stroked his head and made comforting noises low in her throat . At last he could say with simple despair , " You do know , do n't you , we 're lost ? Fidelio 's confirmed his folk have never been here . We 'll grope from T machine to T machine  --  . In a thousand years , spending billions of probes , the Betans found how to go between a couple of score stars ... and no Others , nobody to help .... Caitlin , we 're done for . " She shook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ athwart stars , and answered quietly , well-nigh merrily , " I 'll believe that of me when they lay the coppers on my eyes , and maybe not then . But suppose the thing that you say is the worst , Martti , darling . " He jerked violently . " Och , " she breathed , " you 're in bad shape , so you are . If you 're to help me , let me help you first . Hold still . " In a deft maneuver she released the table , drew alongside him and slightly behind , caught his left arm in her left hand and pinned his legs between her knees . He uttered amazement . " Easy , lad , easy , " she said . " I must be anchoring myself if I 'm to give you the good strong back rub you need . " Her right hand went over him . " Aye , a rat 's nest of Charlie horses , as my father would say were he less dignified and more Irish . Peel down your coverall to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Relax , " she urged . " Let go . We 'll drift loose , but sooner or later we 'll fetch up against a wall  --  a bulkhead  --  and meanwhileI can be loosening of that poor latissimus dorsi for you . " Kneading , she chuckled . " All my own invention . Free fall sex made me wonder about free fall massage , the more so when himself often is tensed No , easy , I told you , easy . " Looking about her as she worked : " Suppose we shall indeed go lost for some years , until our food is no more and each of us must choose how to die . I do not admit this is the case , mind you , but suppose it is . What a grand fate ! " " Huh ? " he exclaimed . " You ca n't be serious . " " I am that . Oh , it will be hard to give up mountains and seas , sunshine through rain , a hearthfire at evening . But think , Martti , dear . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to know it  --  then more suns , more worlds , more beauties and marvels , maybe at last a new Demeter for us , though if not , why , then at the end our few years out here in the universe will have held more than most centuries ever did before . " Her hold upon him tightened , her working hand grew eager . " Be glad in your life ! "  |p227Intended  for the unknown , Chinook bore a superb panoply of scientific instruments . But save for the two computermen , no specialist in any of their uses was aboard . Sufficient technical knowledge , including the knowledge of how to look things up , existed among the travelers that , largely under Weisenberg 's guidance , they could find ways to learn something about the realm wherein they were stranded . However , that might prove to be fatally little . Then Joelle made her announcement to captain and engineer : Fidelio had the skill . His race had explored many planetary systems , no two alike . Its professional spacefarers included a cadre trained in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the day when the next robot probe would return with the news that it had found another gateway back . He had been one such , as well as a xenological officer who spoke for his ship when she visited aliens . The combination had gotten him picked for Emissary . " His technique involves holothetics , as you should expect , " she cautioned . " We 'll have to modify a unit for him to use . The way was developed on Beta , and between us we remember fairly well what it is . But you realize a certain amount of cut-and-try is necessary . Furthermore , our equipment is crude by his standards . " " Could we build him the right kind ? " Weisenberg asked . " If you were thrown back in time to Galileo , could you build him a hundred-meter orbiting reflector ? " she gibed . " Oh , I daresay a few minor improvements here and there will be possible for us in due course , especially in software . At present , though , we must get what data @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ determine masses , take spectrograms , et cetera . You have to do them anyway . After Fidelio 's linkage is ready , he can tell you what kind of additional information he and I will need , particularlyinformation fed into us directly and continuously . " Let us alone to consult . Go about your business . I 'll tell you what else to do and when . " Brodersen lifted a brow without saying anything . She recognized his " My , is n't the air kind of thin on top of that high horse ? " expression from of old . He never used it on me before ! went through her like ice . He was always too respectful of my mind . What 's changed him ? The stress of this expedition ? That Caitlin adventuress ? The question persisted in her through the days that followed . Not that she was obsessed : except by work , like everybody else . Nevertheless it came back into her awareness again and again , most sharply when she was trying to sleep.  |p228This  was often difficult . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the pleasure of floating and flying was slight compared to the tedium of long daily times at the exercise machines lest her blood go stale and her very bones dwindle . ( The rest talked or sang or watched shows , that kind of thing . She cared for none of it . Theoretically she could have retreated into her head , where mathematics and the memory of the Noumenon dwelt , as she frequently did at leisure . But the dull , sweaty exertions were too nagging . ) Worse , just as she was on the edge of dreams , more and more she would rouse with a gasp from a sense of falling into a fathomless pit . Then she must drift in the dark at the end of her leash and try for calm . Thoughts roiled forth which she did not want . Why do I care that Dan no longer cares ? He was never more to me than an animal , smarter and stronger than most , excellent in bed , yet only an animal to fill some of those hours when I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use , he intimated he 'd oblige  --  probably not now , he 's probablytoo harassed and uncertain , but eventually . Or I could turn to ... Rueda , I suppose . A man of the world like him would see past my post-menopausal gray hair , and doubtless be quite an artist . Never mind dignity . Sex is a mere bodily need , like defecation . Is it ? Eric , Eric ! Hold . Wait . It is n't even a need . I 've gone close to nine years without and hankered little and seldom . Is the fear of death making me feel lonely ? We are going to die out here . The odds against us finding our way back are ... no , not incalculable ... ridiculous .... But if we take reasonable care , given reasonable luck , we ought to have , oh , ten years until the food is gone . With no geriatrician aboard , I could be dead of bodily failure earlier than that . Besides , I learned long ago not to fear death . Having looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to dread the loss of . There is a temporary association of mitochondria , eukaryotic cells , intestinal flora , and the like , the whole symbiosis shading off into the world around it that begot it , serving no end except the perpetuation of the genes within . Were the immortality of my " person " offered me , I would not want it . Too petty , amidst atoms , eons , and galaxies . Indeed , I should welcome this unparalleled chance to explore , experience , learn . That I can not report my findings to my colleagues is regrettable . However , from my viewpoint it is the loss of a very trivial satisfaction compared to what awaits me in the next decade . Then why do I want somebody holding me ? Why is it so long till mornwatch and my work ? Work was absorbing despite every exasperation of zero gravity andp229Murphy 's Law . The aim was to adapt Chinook 's holothetic system for Fidelio . First came the mechanical part , a helmet to fit his skull and attachments for the rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the electronics , circuits built and adjusted to resonate with a nervous web that was the consequence of several billion years of separate evolution . This would have been a major research project if it had not already been one on Beta . As was , most of the requirements were known . Just the same , Su Granville and Joelle herself must spend hour upon hour writing programs and then in linkage , whenever Weisenberg had supplied a new fistful of data from his instruments . Leino helped somewhat , and the others did what j ackleg jobs they could as occasion demanded . Else they were engaged in astronomy and space physics . Because they had to be kept fed and their clothes and bedding laundered , Caitlin put down her eagerness and did that for the cause of survival . Often at mess or during exercise periods she sang to them . That was almost the only recreation that anybody got . Hardware available , the true challenge came : to create the basic program by which Fidelio would integrate himself with the computer . Even among humans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not human . Furthermore , Betan computer technology had considerable differences from Terrestrial . ( Yet oddly enough , insofar as comparisons were possible , it did not seem that holothetes of either species had a deeper or broader insight than those of the other . Betan machines possessed numerous superiorities , but , linked into them , Joelle had functioned more or less the same as at home . Did brains have equal limitations ? Or did the Ultimate itself ? ) Again , and in a still higher degree , the task would have been hopeless had it not been accomplished beforehand on Beta , when mutual linkage of members of the two races was seen as desirable . Joelle and Fidelio were simply trying to duplicate something from Emissary which they remembered fairly well ... except that there was nothing simple involved . Instead there was a whole new computer language  --  practically a new semantics  --  plus an elaborate program for translating to a language the Chinook machine could handle , plus a program for translating back , plus an open-ended set of special instructions . Joelle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a general way how to reconstruct the details , by brute-strength logic , calculation , and experiment . Not as an analogy but as a metaphor : The problem was like that which would face a Peruvian called upon to interpret between a Chinese and an Arab , when he is rusty in both their tongues , the former stutters , and the latter is a deaf-mute . Without linkage , the problem would have been insoluble . Susanne would hook herself up and check tentative programs for inconsistenciesp230and inadequacies , when she was n't needed for the ongoing research elsewhere . Joelle and Fidelio would then try them out . This was hard on Joelle ; she would perceive Reality distorted , bleached , fevered , and afterward have nightmares , in which she most commonly saw Eric 's rotted corpse . She would wake , tell herself Fidelio was n't complaining , though it must be worse for him , and go back to work . To enter the pure Noumenon again was always healing . Chinook lay for a pair of weeks in orbit around the planet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ready , female of intellect , " he said when he had given the assembly a careful examination . He used the speech , throaty and whistling , that his people did in air . It was much easier for him than Spanish . " Let us make a trial and , if we find we are on a strong tide , go straight ahead to sense the wholeness of this volume-where-we-swim . " She felt a smile at the idiom . It faded as she looked at him . Half a sea creature , he was beautiful in free fall . Long and richly brown , his body undulated from prowlike muzzle and lapis lazuli eyes to the end of the powerful , precisely controlled tail ; each digit of the six limbs knew what it did , and its motion flowed . His tang as of iodine nigh overwhelmed her with memories of beaches on Earth , surf and wind , sunlight and gull wings . How wrong that he was caged in this narrowness between two computer stacks , that meters and switches were before him instead of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ painted metal instead of moving green depths and , overhead , a splintered radiance . She pulled her attention away and , keeping a grip on a handhold , punched the intercom button . " Su , " she called . " This is Joelle . Come . " It might take the linker a few minutes to get shut of whatever she was doing . " To go back to the deeps below the deeps , that will be like returning to the shore after inland years , " Fidelio breathed . " I know , " Joelle said . The same ardor was in her . Holothesis shared with a Betan had dimensions no human partner could offer , among them the knowledge that her dissimilarities to him gave him an equal heightening . Together they had speculated whether the Others might not be several distinct races who formed groups that were permanently linked . " It has been dry .... " Fidelio 's voice trailed off . He was not really capable of self-pity . Pain on his behalf clenched . Her free hand sought his nearest arm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could have shredded her , but she felt simply warmth and velvet . " Oh , Fidelio , " she whispered.  |p231Your  food stores are good for less than a year . You will die among glabrous , tailless , four-limbed trolls who ca n't unaided swim a single day ; no wife will hold you that you may suckle her for the last time as you sink ; we do not know how you ought to be mourned . His un-Earthly gaze captured hers . " I would ask this of you , Joelle , " he said calmly . She expected him to shift his glance at once , for a Betan stared hard only at someone who had angered him or at someone whom he loved and was offering his faith to . He kept looking . The blood beat in her ears . " Be warned , it is no ripple , it is a wave . " " Yes , if I 'm able . " " Now that I can use this equipment , let me be the holothete whenever we need a single one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have nothing else left , do you , Fidelio ? She let go the handhold in order to clasp his arm doubly . " Y-yes . " " You can carry out searches of your own when I float at rest . In a while , the system will again be yours entirely . " Her eyes stung . God damn it , she was n't about to cry , was she ? Joelle shook her head ; the drops flittered glittering . " Is this not acceptable ? " Did he sound resigned ? How could she tell ? " G'ng-ng , I understand , female of intellect . My request ebbs . " " No , no ! " The force of her reaction dismayed her . Overwrought , short on sleep , the forebrain functional but the rest going into oscillation . If I do n't take care , I 'll have hysterics . " You . . . misunderstood . I did n't mean a negative . Of course you take over . Any time , any time . " " You let water flow , Joelle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cast on a sharp-shelled reef ? . Have I done that ? " " No . You  --  no . Fidelio , we can link together ! " " Often , I trust , beginning today . I scent a splendor before us . But Joelle , dear mind-mate , more often  --  " He was stammering , she thought , and she saw the tendons grow tense behind his claws . " Alone in the All , I can raise Beta from it , wife , co-husbands , children , grandchildren , friends , the living and the dead alike , not mere memories but perceived realities in space-time ; I can feel that they exist . It will be nearly as good as embracing them . " He stopped . Blurrily though she saw him , she sensed his astonishment . " You did not know this , Joelle ? You have never done it yourself ? No words will serve to explain . Well , I think I can show you , teach you , before I go down . I must certainly try . It is very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She cast her body against his , held tight , and wept . Susanne came through the door . " ' Ere I am , " she said ; and : " Oh ! Pardonnez-moi ! Vous me pardonnerez ! " Awkward in free fall , she tried to withdraw . Joelle , twisting her neckp232about ( cheek brushing along the pelt of her mind-mate , who had gently laid his two lower arms around her while the talons of the upper left stroked her hair ) saw the linker sprattle in the doorway like a large black spider . When Fidelio , with whom she begot new comprehensions , was soon to die , but before he died might lead her to Oneness with Eric and Chris and himself and  --  " Get out ! " Joelle screamed . " You ugly little bitch ! Go ! " Susanne fled weeping . " What has come loose ? " the Betan asked anxiously . Nobody , nobody should see me like this ... except you , you 're not human , you 've my fellow holothete .... I 'm being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must apologize . No . How can I explain ? Anger : Why should ! explain ? Why must I alone forever be rational ? Bewilderment : Why have I kept remembering Eric , these past week  --  e 's no more than a linker either . Less than that , the last I heard  --  settled down , long married , become a not particularly important administrator in Calgary . Joelle gasped for air . " N-n-nothing , Fidelio . I 'm tired and  --  Hold me close , let me rest a while . Then I 'll get a sleeping pill , " from our medical officer , that Mulryan woman ; well , she may have the grace not to try sympathizing , " and ... afterward I 'll be in better shape to . . . oh , Fidelio ! " Susanne sought her cabin , saying no word to anyone , apart from informing Caitlin that she would n't be in the mess for dinner . Next mornwatch she entered the computer center expressionless . " I 'm sorry I yelled at you , " Joelle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeling distressed on Fidelio 's account . He 's an old friend . " " I understand , madame , " the linker replied with care ; and they went about their mutual business . Actually Susanne had little to do beyond monitoring , to make certain the union of Joelle , Fidelio , computers , and instruments did not start going subtly agley . It did not ; the bugs were finally out of the system . The two holothetes joined awarenesses as two lovers who know each other well join bodies , and became more than the sum of themselves , and let the universe pour through them . Much they already knew from observations and deductions made by their shipmates . The bearings of neighbor galaxies showed this region to be approximately five hundred light-years from Sol in the general direction of Hercules . That information made various bright stars like Deneb and objects like the Orion Nebula identifiable , which in turn defined thep233position more precisely . ( As if it mattered . A single light-year is an abyss wherein imagination drowns . ) The sun was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , luminosity 0.004 Sol . It had five planets , none of them in the least Earthlike , all seemingly barren  --  except , perhaps , this largest , around which the T machine and Chinook were orbiting at a distance of some twenty-four million kilometers . That world was a giant , ninety-two percent the mass of Jupiter , attended by a dozen moons . Its mean distance from its primary was 1.64 a.u. , a bit further out than Mars is from Sol . Like Jupiter , it had a vast atmosphere , chiefly hydrogen , secondarily helium ; lesser components included ammonia , methane , and more elaborate organic compounds . Also like Jupiter , it was hot from contraction ; the upper air was thin and space-cold , but lower down it thickened and warmed , until water became a vapor and storms raged that were the size of lesser planets . Most of its bulk was liquid , though sheer pressure , despite temperature , kept solid a metallic core equal to about five Earths . Spinning around once in ten hours and thirty-five minutes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the sun . However , the latter was so feeble a radiator that these Van Allen belts were nowhere near the Jovian intensity . No human could safely linger long in them ; but , given her electrostatic defenses , Chinook could drop down through them and climb back up without those aboard getting a dosage to worry about . She would have a reason to . Joelle and Fidelio would have lost themselves in sun , moons , ambient magnificences and subtleties , every uniqueness . Hardly had they settled into the wonderful kaleidoscope , however , when a thing tugged at the fringes of their consciousness . They dismissed it a while , explored a vortex , found out why an inner globe rotated widdershins , established that this whole system was older than Sol 's ; but the thing would not go away . Almost impatiently , they brought their double mind to confront it . 1 lcrtzian emission from the world they were circling , yes , surely , what else would you expect ? The fact leaped forth . Lightning , synchrotron effects , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Each had its set of patterns , which the holothetes understood in the way that a ballet dancer understands how another is executing a pas seul . But one small element was like a flute , defiant and variable amidst the uproar of a gale at seaPerhaps in a decade of concentrated effort , unaided humans would havep234made this discovery . The holothetes realized instantly that here was nothingwhich unliving nature could produce : therefore , that they were overhearing the discourse of beings which were alive and intelligent . Afloat in the common room before his crew , the planet splendid at his back , Brodersen said into a hush : " Yeah , I do believe we should go look . " " The hazard is too great , " Joelle objected . " We 're safe in orbit . We can keep signalling . " " Till we start starving ? " Dozsa snorted . The effort to get a response had been his . " We could , you know . " " Really ? " Caitlin asked . " And why should that be ? Have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mathematical signal they can not mistake ? " Dozsa smiled through the weariness on his broad features . " You 've been too busy to hear the news , no , my dear ? Well , the basic problem is the sheer size of that world . And , yes , the natural background at those frequencies , the noise level . Without holothetics , we might never have strained the information-carrying fraction out . It 's a mere by-product of broadcasts . The natives , whoever they are , have no reason to listen for calls from outside , I am sure . We must use a tight beam , to get a power they can not miss picking up and identifying . But then we touch just a very small area . " He gestured at the tawny globe . " The whole of it is huge . And the broadcasting sources are n't fixed , they appear to be constantly moving around . " " I 'd like to know how that 's done , " Brodersen remarked , " or how electronics is possible there . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attempt on the  --  off chance , do you say ? " Dozsa went on . " Although mainly to pass the time while others collected more planetological data . The probability of our striking a receiver which happens to be tuned to the precise right band is  --  " he released his handgrip for a moment to shrug the more eloquently  --  " about like the probability of our guessing the path around that T machine which will get us back to the Solar System . " " Besides , " Rueda pointed out superfluously , , " we 're under a time limit . Exercise will not maintain our health indefinitely in free fall . We must soon have weight . Our reaction mass is limited , and if we go into spin mode , that 's irreversible ; we 'll lie in orbit forever . " " Therefore , either we quit here and jump through a random gate , or we make an effort to contact the natives , " Brodersen summarized . " I vote forp235sticking with what we 've got till we know it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obeyed on the spot , but in a loneliness like this , a captain who did not consult the strategic wishes of his followers would not long remain captain . " There is thinking , technologically sophisticated life here . And it 's a life that maybe rates high with the Others , since they did n't put the T machine in a Lagrange position , but right in satellite orbit before God and everyman . " He paused . " The dwellers could be Others themselves . " Silence fell , until Caitlin whispered , " Marvel on marvel , dear darling , if that be so ! " Planetlight shone golden in her eyes . " The conditions there , " Joelle protested . " Williwaw should be able to meet them , " Brodersen replied . " She was tested out at Zeus  --  robotically , of course , because of the radiation , but still , she could take everything that hit her . " The biggest attendant of Phoebus was actually larger than Jupiter by the mass of a few Earths or Demeters . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sure , it 'll be hazardous , but I 've seen worse hazards and I 'm still around to lie about them . " He got scant argument . When it was done , Brodersen said , " Okay , next question . Who goes with me ? " Caitlin snapped her head " up , " but it was Rueda who exclaimed , " With you ? What are you talking about ? " " Since it will be risky , we 'll send a minimum crew , " Brodersen told them . " Pilot , co-pilot doubling as communications officer , and  --  well , they 'll both be busier'n a one-armed octopus , so I figure a third as well , to be lookout and whatever else is required . " " I ! " Leino and Frieda practically shouted . Weisenberg cleared his throat and said louder than he was wont : " Hold on , everybody . Hold on . Let 's talk sense . Which you are not doing , skipper , if you really mean it about going down yourself . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for co-pilot , at least . Do you suppose I 'd send men into danger I do n't go into ? " " Dan , that 's chemically pure horse shit . " In Weisenberg 's mouth the vulgarism had shock value . " The captain does not do such things . He has no right . " " True , true , " Rueda put in . " You are too important to our survival . " Brodersen flushed . " Oh , come on ! ' ' " No , you come off  --  off that nonsense , " Weisenberg snapped . " Aye , aye , if something happened to you we 'd elect a new chief and carry on . But we 'd not carry on as well , would we , now ? You 're no superman , Dan . You dop236have a talent for coordinating people 's efforts , though . Besides , you tote around a lot of knowledge about your responsibilities , the kind of knowledge that never gets written down . " A murmur of assent answered him . He thrust his Rameses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got to be cold-bloodedly rational about this , " he said , rapid-fire . " Those who go must be competent to go , and at the same time be those whose loss would n't cripple us . Besides Dan , we have three who can pilot the boat , and we need two . Stef , Carlos , Frieda , right ? Which two ? " His hand chopped off their yeas . " Shut up . Think straight . Carlos could readily replace Stef as mate . But you could too , Frieda , with a bit of strain , and you 're the only gunner we 've got . That 's a real specialty . I 'm not saying we 'll run into a fight out here . Most likely we wo n't , unless against nature ; but that might require placing a ray or an explosive exactly where it 's needed . True ? True . " Very well , Stef and Carlos pilot . They can squabble between them who gets top billing . " His glance darted back and forth . " Who 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Nor Martti or me  --  shut up , I told you , Marttil I 'm the CE and he 's my assistant and backup . Without proper maintenance , and repair at need , this ship is dead . Who 's left ? Su and Caitlin . Su has much better technical training . But gravity on that planet is about two and a half times Earth normal . You 're not strong , Su . " His lips creased momentarily upward . " Tough , I 'd say , tougher than you have the reputationof being ; but not very strong in the muscles and not too fast in the reflexes either . Caitlin  --  " " Wait a flinkin ' minute ! " Brodersen roared . " No ! " Leino yelled . " Do you mean that ? " Caitlin cried . She released her handhold , kicked off , arrowed to Weisenberg , and cast her arms about him . The impact knocked him loose and they drifted away together , gyrating , while she gave him kiss after kiss and outrage boiled around them.  |p237GUIDED  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orbit which kept her above the region her boat would seek out . That put her below the radiation belts . Indeed , the field warded off most of the particle flux that she encountered in free space . Conveyor and cranes swung Williwaw clear and the daughter vessel blasted free . " O-o-oh , " Caitlin breathed , a sound like a prayer . She had watched approach on the viewscreens and been awed , but now she was out in flesh and bone before a terrible splendor . Optical systems in the control cabin opened on one entire hemisphere and elsewhere on large sections of heaven . The planet filled almost half . When she looked its way , there was nothing else to see ; amber and gold , the inward-flooding light bore every star out of vision . To the right , unutterably distant , red bands along the rim of the world deepened into purple and thence into the cosmic blackness . The sun stood yonder , a tiny coal . To left was the nearer edge of night , a dark which lived with faint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high clouds catching dawn-glow . Between stretched the daylit face , bright zones , richer-hued bands , in a thousand shifting shades , they themselves ever changeable , streaming , undulating , forming whirlpools , tides , rivers , an endless dance , majestic and joyous . The boat murmured and throbbed . Recondensing jet vapor made a ruddy fog-bank aft , small to see  --  it dissipated as fast as it formed  --  but soonR veiling Chinook 's globe from sight . Weight held the farers steady in their seats . Though less than a gee , acceleration was considerable , in order to get them down shortly after local sunrise . Rueda 's exchange of information with the ship was a dry obbligato , unreal-sounding . He ended it as if in relief . Thus far everything was satisfactory . For ap238while he sat quiet , like his companions . Radiance made a halo of his baldness . At last he said softly , " Mother of God , a man might die quite happy after this . " Dozsa grinned , not too mirthfully . His accent thickened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wife and children at home . Here is the kind of experience I like to have had . " Rueda looked surprised . " And still you came along ? " " What else ? I agreed we must go search , and I am best qualified . " Dozsa was piloting , since besides past practice , he was a martial arts enthusiast , trained into strength and speed . " Do n't get me wrong , Carlos . I am not afraid . In fact , I relish the challenge . But I will relish it more in retrospect . " He crossed himself . " Or in the afterlife , if God does not will we succeed . Our death ought to be clean and quick . " " Aye . " Caitlin was barely audible . " A shooting star in a sky like that  --  sure , and there are many harder fates , there are . " " One feels near to God on this mission , no ? " Rueda said , almost as muted . " But He is not the kindly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nor the just Lord our priest called on . " " He is those and more , " Dozsa replied . " Caitlin , you pagan , even you must be hearing Him out of your childhood . " She shook her head . Braided , her hair was a chiaroscuro around it . " No . Perhaps they were too Catholic in Ireland for me , a part of their seeking to rebuild after the Troubles and keep the faith after the Others ... and I a rebel born . I 've no anger in me any more , though . " Dozsa smiled . " Well , let 's not argue . We have not the energy to spare . If you do n't mind , I will include you in my prayers . Most likely I shall be thinking a few . " Rueda looked behind him to where she sat . " What do you believe in , if I may ask ? " he inquired . " In life , " she said . They fell silent , watching the planet draw closer , night recede @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of demands for readings and confirmation of flight plan details rattled forth . Having complied , Rueda added , " That was unnecessary , my friends . " Brodersen 's voice replaced Joelle 's . It was almost unrecognizable : " My fault . I insisted . You 're really okay ? " " Never better , my darling , " Caitlin made bold to answer , " save for not having you here . And this cabin is rather cramped for sports anyhow . Make up our bed before I come back . It needs it , you will be remembering . " " Pegeen , please  --  " " I 'm sorry . " She reached toward the loudspeaker as if toward him . " Youp239fear for me . But would I not be fearing for you , were you bound off like this ? Ah , do n't be selfish , be glad for me on such a grand adventure . " " I 'm ... trying .... " " No , more than an adventure . Magic they never dreamed of in Tfr na n ( 5g @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need a name for our planet , do we win to its people . We can scarcely pronounce theirs , whatever it be . " Brodersen hesitated . " And ? " " I thought of Danu , the mother goddess of the Tuatha de Danaan , they who became the great Sidhe . " " Done , by thunder ! " he decreed . Williwaw entered perceptible atmosphere more abruptly than above Demeter , for this air was compressed hard by gravity . Her path and vectors had been computed with that in mind . She got continuous guidance from Joelle , holothetically linked to instruments whose operators Fidelio had told what to probe for . Else her mission would have been suicidal . As was , in the first hour Dozsa used himself to limits beyond what he had been sure were his . Rueda was nearly as busy , handling communication back and forth , often helping steer . The cabin soon stank from their sweat . It filled with monstrous roars , shrieks , rumbles , whistlings . Their own weight hauled at the humans , two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bear . Every finger grew heavy , an arm was a burden , necks strained to keep heads positioned , guts sagged , hearts toiled , ribs ached from breathing , mouths dried out and throats went raw . That would not have happened on a test centrifuge or aboard a watchship under full thrust , where a person could sit or lie at ease . Danu raged . Stratospheric impact made the boat shudder , bounce about , buck like a mustang . Deeper down , at low relative speed , she encountered winds to send her tumbling . If not skillfully met , they might have torn her wings off . Designed for Earthlike worlds , she was aerodynamically poor on this one . Nor did skill alone compensate , when the whole sky was strange . More than once , Joelle herself was taken by surprise , as some violence erupted which she had not had the data to predict . However swift her response , it must be spoken , which ate seconds . From a Betan mother ship she could have piloted directly , could virtually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , must cope however they were able , till they got a word to help them . Twice they passed through storms . Blindness clamped down , until lightning turned flying cloud wracks incandescent . Thunder followed ; it was like being inside a cannon . The gales racketed and snatched . Each dropp240through turbulence ended with spine-jarring force . Roll , pitch , and yaw flung bodies against harnesses . Once hailstones crashed against the hull , once a Noah 's rain engulfed it . Throughout , Caitlin watched . She could do nothing else , except now and then tap a shoulder and point to a thing in the distance that looked sinister  --  mountain-tall cloud , vortex of turbulence , snake 's nest of lightning , or a wildness for which humans had no ready word . Otherwise she refrained from bothering the men . She watched , she sent her whole being outward , she laughed for happiness . Williwaw won through . Occasionally it seemed doubtful she would , despite computations giving her favorable odds , but she did . Reaching the altitude whence the broadcasts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Here the air was thick and warm and had no haste . Thermal currents welled from below to help upbear her . The autopilot could take over . She lazed through a broad circle and began a broadcast of her own , taped signals on various Danaan wavebands . A beam carried Rueda 's dull tone aloft : " We are safe . Repeat , we are safe . Give us a few minutes to rest , and we 'll report . " Like Dozsa , he slumped , chin falling on chest . Caitlin leaned forward to touch both men . " Oh , my poor tired dears  --  " She stopped , for she grew aware of what was around her . Without light amplification , she would have been blind . Given it , she saw widely . The foreignness was such that she needed a while before vision could truly register ; but an onrush of beauty came at once . Above , heaven was indigo at the horizon , lightening to violet at the zenith . Single clouds wandered there , faerie shaped , colored for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rainbow ring . Below , a cloud deck lay like an ocean , but no ocean that men had ever sailed . Its reach was imperial ; it had peaks , canyons , smoky plains , great slow cataracts , infinitely intricate yet never twice the same . Aureate , it was touched with reds , streaked with blues and greens and browns , shadowed where it plunged into mysteries . A flock went by afar . Were they winged , were they finned ? They were gone too fast to see ; but they had gleamed . There came a lulling sound from outside , from the calmly flowing wind . Caitlin reclined her chair and let aches begin to drain away . The heaviness upon her was only like a strong , over-kindly hand . After a while the humans recovered enough to talk with their ship , take readings , record views , and talk some more . A while after that , certain Danaans arrived.  |p241Caitli  n saw them first . Her partners were busy again , not as frantically as on the descent , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speaker gave nothing but crackle , buzz , chaos , no matter what Rueda tried . Somewhere above them , in that serene-looking heaven , some electric event had somehow made the upper atmosphere opaque to every frequency at his command . This was not a possibility , or at least a likelihood , that the holothetes had foreseen . They were not gods , they had had less information to go on than a Betan expedition would have gathered , and besides , every world in the universe is unique . Dozsa feared the trouble portended an equally sudden change in the air . Dense as it was , its pressure close to the limit of what the hull could withstand , might not currents go through it , Gulf Streams of gas whose borders were roiled and dangerous ? Without overmuch hope , he sought hints from instruments and from the feel of the boat . Thus they might well have missed the newcomers , gone by entirely , had Caitlin not been on the alert . She cried out  --  sang out  --  and pounded their backs while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pointed afresh . Rueda whistled . " Marvelous , " he said . " Make for them , Stefan . " Dozsa scowled . " I 'm not sure , " he replied . " Under these conditions , to break our holding pattern  --  " " Down , you amaddn ! " Caitlin shouted . " I swear they are what we came here fort " " How can you tell ? " the mate demanded . " Do you mean to say you can not ? " " Well ... well  --  all right . I suppose if we do n't investigate , we 'll have had our trouble for nothing . " Caitlin rumpled his sweat-gummed hair . " Now you talk the way Dan would be wanting . " Between buoyancy and updrafts , stalling speed for Williwaw was low . Downward bound , Dozsa slowed her as much as he dared , or maybe a little more . The sight before her sprang into clarity , and dazzled . By the woman 's count , nineteen forms , traveling by twos and threes , had risen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vessel , a kilometer lower but precisely on its projected track . They were the size of sperm whales and had the same basic torpedo shape , the same blunt shouts  --  in which the mouths ( ? ) were set foremost , circular , closable by sphincters  --  and flukes at the after end  --  though these were fourfold , both horizontal and vertical , and seemed to be flexible control surfaces rather t Ilan propellers . Short tendrils and long antennae encircling their muzzles doubtless held , or were , sense organs . From their middles bulged a pair ofp242intricate muscular structures , out of which sprang smooth , narrow wings that exceeded the body in length . Forward of these were two arms ( or trunks , since they appeared to be boneless ) ending in what humans could only call hands . The coloring was exquisite : royal blue on backs shaded to sapphire beneath , while the wings were ashimmer like diffraction jewels , each movement of their pliant surfaces an interplay of chromatic waves . Glory exploded when the creatures began to dance for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they turned , they glided within centimeters of each other , they arced off across kilometers , a wheeling , weaving , fountaining measure which seized the mind and drew it into itself as great art ever does , or love . " They have music for that , " Caitlin foreknew . " Carlos , can you be tuning in their music ? " Rueda tore loose from his own rapture and worked with the sonic receiver . Presently he had eliminated the boom of the boat 's passage , damped the wind-sounds , and brought in the song . From sea-deep basses to ice-clear sopranos , and below and above those pitches humans can hear , tones filled the cabin . They were on no scale known to children of Earth ; if they gave the men any clear first impression , it was of unshakeable power ; but Caitlin said while tears stood in her eyes , " Oh , the joy in them , the joy ! You can not hear it ? Then look how they frolic . " " I 'd better concentrate on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gaze straying to the half stately , half genial harmony of movements around him , he swung Williwaw through a tight curve . " It 's welcoming us they are , " Caitlin said . " If they are in truth the Others , och , I always knew those must be happy folk . " " Eh , wait , my dear , " Rueda cautioned . " It 's a superb spectacle , but you 're jumping to conclusions . Those could simply be curious and playful animals , like dolphins cavorting around a watercraft . " " With hands ? They use their hands better than hula dancers . " " Where are clothes , ornaments , tools , any sign of artifacts ? " " They need none right now . Hush . I think I may be in the way ofstarting to understand that music . " " You 'd better hurry , " Dozsa warned . " I ca n't safely continue this maneuver . I 'll have to go back to a larger radius pretty soon . The trouble is , our stalling speed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " As one would expect , " Rueda said . " Nature designed them for ... Danu . Man did not design this boat for it . Besides , she 's nuclearpowered , while they run on chemistry  --  I 'm sorry , Caitlin , you wanted quiet . "  | " No , go on , if you 've a thought , " she said . " I just wanted to listen , not dispute . I 'll save an ear for you . Science too is a set of arts . " Rueda smiled lopsidedly . " I 'm no scientist . A Sunday dabbler in it at most .... We are getting this scene on tape , are n't we ? " " Aye , of course . " " Good , " Dozsa said bleakly . " Life like this on a world like this . It 'll give us much to talk about in the years ahead . " The pageant went on . Humans spoke amidst its melodies , staring at its motion , as they flew between red dwarf sun and sea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lighter-than-air ships , " Rueda ventured . " Those giant bodies are mostly gas bags , inflated by their own heat . Vents help them rise or sink , the wings catch winds , and probably there 's a jet arrangement as well , using a bellows or  --  I do n't know ; but the atmosphere 's dense enough at this level to make it practical . They breathe hydrogen instead of oxygen , naturally , but I suspect they 're otherwise not so unlike us , they 're also made of proteins in water solution . " " Where do they come from ? " Dozsa wanted to know . " What made them evolve ? How did life start in the first place ? Where does the food chain begin ? " " How many years and research organizations will you allow me for those questions , my friend ? If you want my guess , I 'd say the ' primordial ocean ' is down under the clouds , where the air gets really dense and chemicals can concentrate  --  originally on colloids ? Remember , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ radiates more than it receives . That means a thermal gradient to drive biochemistry , especially when the sun is weak . Energy comes more from below than above . I daresay our altitude here is marginal for life , like Antarctica or the sea bottoms of Earth . " Dozsa scowled at the dancers . " Intelligence developing when the whole ecology floats ? How would it ? No stone for tools , no fire  --  " Rueda nodded . " That 's why I confess to doubts about those otherwise delightful animals . " Caitlin straightened in her harness . " Wurra , wurra , where have you two parked your imaginations ? " she challenged . " Can you not think of growths adrift for use , like kelp and fish bones , only better ? If you must have a thing that answers to fire , what about enzymes that catalyze reduction of organic compounds ? And do we know what made apes turn manward on Earth , let alone dogmatizing about the subject on a foreign planet ? " Rueda stroked his mustache . " True @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of electronics without solid materials , minerals , being available . Yes , conceivably the Others know tricks with pure force-fields.  |p244But  how does one get from here to there ? Not in a single bound ! Native Danaan sentience might develop , it might get as noble and artistic and intellectual as you please , but by itself it has no way to build a **35;5597;TOOLONG . " His laugh came brittle . " E piersi muove . We 've detected transmitters . " He sagged . Weariness flattened his voice . " Never mind . I 'm afraid this gravity is getting to my marrow . I ca n't think very well . How I hope something more happens soon . " Dozsa nodded . He had no reason to repeat what they knew . Their stay was sharply limited in time . Muscles might adapt to high weight , but the cardiovascular system , the entire fluid distribution of the human body , could not . Blood was pooling in the lower extremities ; the laboring heart grew less and less able to supply the brain ; seepage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be irreversible . Meanwhile the hull was not impermeable . At this pressure , molecules of hydrogen were leaking through metal . The mixture would at last become explosive . " Well , we planned on remaining till near sundown . " Dozsa sighed . " Probably we were too optimistic . Distances must be great everywhere on Danu . Those people , if they are intelligent , must be those that happened to be close by . The others  --  the Others  --  " " The true Others would have arrived sooner , is that what you are saying , Stefan ? " Caitlin asked . Again he nodded . " It 's right you are , I fear . " She looked back outward . " But how lovely they are here , how full of bliss ! " Dozsa returned Williwaw to her former height and path . The dance continued . The visitors watched and recorded as best they could . The ember sun passed noon . More Danaans came . There was no longer any doubting their sapience . The dance dissolved , and those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ objects hung on their titanic persons , some guided vehicles of various shapes ( platforms ? birds ? chambered nautiluses ? ) from which projected devices ( telescopes ? cobwebs ? interlocked rings ? ) . They did not attempt to meet the spacecraft , but came to rest well beneath her and adjusted their apparatuses . The radio receiver brought in ordered sounds , in the same wide range as earlier tunes but plainly speech . " Give me five minutes , " Rueda muttered , and got busy with a reflection spectrometer which had been preset for him aboard Chinook . Dozsa heldp245the boat in a steady wheeling at a steady speed , though an afternoon wind was rising to drone around her structure and thrill through it . Aches , exhaustion , the drag of gravity were forgotten . " How do we respond ? " Caitlin inquired out of exultation ; and immediately : " Och , aye , a notion , if you 've none better , boys . " " The mike is yours , " Dozsa said . " What have you in mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we wish to communicate . Why start with mathematics ? They know full well that we know the value of pi . But if we can recognize their music for what it is and enjoy the same , faith , they can ours . " Caitlin reached down to the webbing on the side of her chair . " Well that I thought to bring my sonador . " She inserted a program and touched the keyboard . Eine Kleine Nachtmusik tumbled forth . " They offered us mirth , " she explained . " Let us offer it back . " A screen at high magnification showed the Danaans reacting . At least , they moved about ... to confer ? " Ha ! " Rueda said . " I expected this . " He tapped the spectrometer . " Those vehicles , most of those gadgets are metal . No alloys I can identify , but unmistakably metal . Tell me how that was mined , on a planet whose surface is hot liquid hydrogen . " " It was n't , " Dozsa declared . " It came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tower of cloud , two Danaan carriers linked together . One of the pilots withdrew on mother-of-pearl wings , the other remained . Suddenly he ( ? ! ) and the machines were hidden behind great sheets and curtains of light . Outward and outward they flared , every color , a created aurora . It wavered about for a short while , as if uncertain . Then " Jesus , Mary , and Joseph , " Caitlin whispered . " They 're replying to Mozart . " She must show the men how this was true , how the lambencies matched the notes ( in no simple fashion , but ever more truly as the unseen artist strengthened a grasp on the intent of an Earthling centuries dead ) until spectrum and scale became a single jubilation . Her understanding of the fact was not strictly scientific , demonstrable by any standard analytical technique ; it was the kind of insight that came to Newton and Einstein . Later sendings and transformations confirmed it . Attempts at television exchange failed ; evidently the electronics were too unlike . Only music @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hello , there ; we love you . " The short day drew toward a close . Caitlin stayed ecstatic , while her companions grew slowly grim . At last :  | " We must go , " Dozsa said . " We have no choice . " " We 'll be back . " Caitlin spoke as if in dreams . " No , I hardly think we will , " Rueda told her with compassion . " Have n't we agreed ? It 's death to linger , down here or up in orbit . Oh , yes , we may be wrong about that , but what can we do except proceed on our best guesswork. .. and have n't we agreed ? " She bowed her head . Twilight closed in ; it was golden . The Danaans waited below for her next message . Rueda leaned around in his seat to clasp the hand Caitlin lifted to him . " Those are not the Others , " he reminded . " They can not be . I guess that they are a ... a favored race @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because they 're happier , kindlier , more creative than most . If that 's right , then the Others give them metal things , for them to realize the better what they are  --  born artists , and who knows what else ? But not scientists . Not engineers . They ca n't help us . And we , we ca n't survive long in these parts , unless we put Chinook into spin mode and make her unable ever to leave . And how often do the Others visit these adopted children of theirs ? Maybe they will next week , but maybe they wo n't for a thousand years . How can we tell ? " " Aye . " Caitlin squared her shoulders against the weight upon her . " Our best bet is to seek onward . " She laughed shakenly . " We 've seen this much of what the universe holds . Ho for the next world ! " Dozsa bit his lip . " If possible , " he said . " We 're still out of touch with Chinook . We 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to clear space . " Caitlin cast regret from her . " Go , lad , go , " she urged . " You 'll make it . We 'll yet be seeing wonders more lofty than here . "  |p247I  WAS A CHIMPANZEE , born where forest met savannah . My earliest memorywas of my mother holding me to her . The warmth and odors of her flesh mingled with the sharper fragrances of hair , and with the smells of soil and growth everywhere around us . Leaves glowed green-gold overhead , sunbeams slanting between them to fleck the ground whereon she sat . My lips sought through her crisp shagginess until they found a teat and gladdened me with belly comfort . Later I ran free and noisy in the band , save when an elder bared teeth . Then one cringed respectfully back . The Eldest , He , was like the sky over us all , which sent rain and sunlight alike , and sometimes roared and flashed till we squalled in terror : for He did lead us to safe trees and delicious fruits , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which made the leopard slink off . I learned where to find bananas and birds ' nests , insects and grubs . Later I learned how to moisten a stick and probe it into the anthills which loomed under the savannah blaze . I began to stand my share of lookout while we drank at the river . Further grown , I became the only female who joined our occasional hunts , when we went after a small animal , caught it , tore it asunder , grew wild from its meat and salty blood and crunchy bones . A craziness more pure was to spring , swing , soar from branch to branch , become speed and air , clasp and let go the tree as a lover . The first who mounted me was He . His grip was python-strong , He growled and thrust , the scent of Him whirled me away . But afterward when my seasons came upon me , I liked best another among the males , the gentlest . We would groom and nuzzle through long , lazy , lovely whiles , or sit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moon-white plain . There was everything to wonder at , sun , weather , a butterfly , elephants ,  |p248lion  roar , flower aromas , the creatures that came in bright shells and stepped forth on two long legs , the distant twinkle of the fires they made at dusk .... We peered , prodded , snuffed , nibbled , listened , hooted our merriment or chattered our anger or mutely marveled . Greatest of wonders was whenever my waxing heaviness departed in pain and left a baby to cling to me . It would grow up and leave me at last , or it would grow still and I would carry it around , hurt , puzzled , till it turned strange ; but always would come new babies , new love . Once the male I liked best wanted me when He did too , and defied . But he was soon thrashed and , groveling , offered his rear . It was a different male who at last brought Him down and became He . A later morning , when we stirred awake , we found the body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our glade . A breeze played with its grizzled fur . The ants were busy . The vultures came . We went away , for somehow fear had touched us . After a crocodile got my special mate , I drifted into a different band . Rank by rank , I rose to be first among its females . We ordered ourselves in less clear and less conscious wise than the males , but we knew who ruled over whom . Indeed , now in my ripeness I had no more dread of them , from Him on down . They came and went on their foolish errands ; we endured ; and the band was really ours  --  was mine . I took the choicest food and resting places among females , but I also of ten kept watch over children , not just my own , and herded them back from danger . Less and less often did my seasons come upon me . Less and less eager for movement , I took to staring outward from the troop , into shadows or rain , across open land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a feeling that more lay yonder than we had wind of . Suddenly , from darkness , the Summoner came . I was borne off and became One , as it were with dawn and lightnings . The tree among whose limbs I leaped was the tree which bears the worlds . I would be returned to live out my chimpanzee days , unharmed , but would ever be haunted by joy I could not really remember . I was Mammal.  |p249WANING  FROM HALF PHASE , the red sun ever closer to its illuminated crescent , Danu remained sublime to the eye . Opposite , a pair of moons stood forth among the brilliances that filled the firmament . Martti Leino could not bear to watch . Alone in his cabin , he hung tethered , for his hands were clasped white-knuckled together except when he smote the bulkhead and rebounded , his legs kicked at nothing except when they trailed helpless . Tears bobbed glittery around his head . " No , God , Lord , no , " he croaked . " Please . You know not what You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Forgive me ! Lord , I spoke ill there . But save her . You can . You will , nay ? Please  --  " He drew lungful after lungful of air till his head spun , his limbs tingled , but he could at least say in a flat voice , in Finnish : " Martti , boy , you are developing a classic case of hysterics . Do you know that ? Very well , stop . It is n't helping Caitlin a bit . Offer an orderly prayer if you wish , but do n't tell God His business , and do be about yours . " Ow-w-w-w ! " he howled and writhed about . He was halfway back under control when the door chimed . " Hoy ? " he asked aloud , stupidly . The chime repeated . " Come in , " he hiccoughed . The chime sounded again . He remembered he had locked himself in , to be undisturbed after he began to tremble . Well  --  Slipping his leash , he kicked toward the entrance , misgauged and fetched up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rookie mistakes before he got the latch released . Frieda von Moltke entered , checked her flight at the jamb , had a good look at Leino , and secured the door behind her . Since he merely gaped , she took the initiative : " Hell and damnation , you are worse off than I expected . " He closed his jaws . " What do you want ? " he managed.  |p250She  clasped him by the upper arms . They drifted off , a slight rotation making the room wobble slowly around them . " I saw how you were getting frantic , " she said . " You went away . Good , I thought , maybe a drink , a tranquilizer , a nap ; he calms down when nobody watches . But you were gone too long . " He turned his face from hers . " They are gone too long . " " Yes , communication broken for hours , and now they must be blasting from the planet , if they are still a life , without guidance , yes . It is very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Jesu Kriste , believe you that matters ? " She gripped him harder . " Martti , dear , listen . My family were soldiersfrom as long ago as we haff chronicles . They knew what it is to lose a friend . Ich hat ' einen Kameraden ... ja . You mourn . But you go on . " He knotted his fists . " If you think  --  simply a friend  --  " Frieda nodded to herself . She checked their flight as they passed a chair , hooked an ankle behind it to hold them , kept him by her left hand , and used her right to cup his chin . " You are being no use to anybody , you know , " she said mildly . " Yes ? Who is not ? The whole crew is waiting , only waiting . What else can we do ? " " We can hearten us , to be ready for tomorrow , " she said . " We can comfort each other . I came to you for that . Cry if you want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my father cry more than once , when we went to lay flowers in the cemetery for his old guerrilla corps . " " Frieda , Frieda . " He clasped her , buried his face in her bosom , and shuddered . She stroked him . " ATTENTION ! " the intercom boomed . " All hands ! Listen ! " Both heads snapped that way . " Listen . " Brodersen 's tones came raw , gulped forth , as if he was weeping . " Message from Williwaw . They , they , they 're okay . Bound back to us . Arriving in two-three hours . They did n't find any help for us , but ... they 're alive ! Well ! They 're coming back ! " " Ya-a-a-ah ! " Frieda screamed , and grabbed Leino 's whole body against hers . He floated like a rag doll , mouth working . Between sounds she did not know , she heard : " Lord , I thank . .. Christ , I thank .... " After a few minutes Brodersen made a calmer announcement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personally would handle the chores of docking . Everybody else might as well sleep . The three from Williwaw would certainly be needing to . In about twelve hours , or however long it took , there 'd be breakfast call , followed by a general debriefing . Thenp251probably Chinook would boost back to the T machine for another jump : That would take more than an Earth day . Meanwhile they could throw a proper wingding to celebrate . " Good night . A real good night , ai n't it ? A real good night . " ( Chinook entered the shadow cone of Danu , and half of heaven was blotted out . ) " We celebrate right away , " Frieda laughed , and kissed Leino . He jerked back . " What do you mean ? " She widened her china-blue eyes . " Why , what do you suppose , luffer ? We are both glad . " He thrust clear of her . Floating off , he held denying palms in her direction . " No . Not right . I will thank the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Get out ! " he yelled . " You slut ! " He struggled . " No . I 'm sorry . I did n't mean that . But  --  well  --  please go , Frieda . You mean well , but please go . " She regarded him for several seconds , and went . Brodersen had restlessness to work off . ( Pegeen , Pegeen . ) Usually at such times he did exercises , but that would now have been intolerable . Therefore he made a tour of inspection . Everything was in order , he knew it would be , but the gesture helped him , gave him a sense he was doing what he could for the worldlet that would most likely be his and Caitlin 's till they died . Not that he was its God  --  Judas priest , no ! ( The juxtaposition tugged a brief smile from him . ) He merely needed to give whatever he was able . Goodbye , Lis , he thought as he flew down silent corridors . Goodbye , Mikey , boy . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even remember me . Goodbye , Barbara , dear darling . You may .... Why do I worry most about you , Babsy ? You 'll grow to be like your mother , a free-standing woman who can shove the world up its own south pole if it dares to threaten you . I 'll miss you , my kids . I really do n't want you to miss me , but it 'd be nice to believe you 'll remember me kindly . He rounded a corner , catching the metal to swing himself about . Lis  --  God damn it , Lis , I love you ! I love you too , Pegeen , and how the hell can I measure between the two of you , and why should 1 ? Lis sits forsaken ; but she can have another man if she wants , or men , and live out a long and full life . Pegeen is here ; but chances are she 'll die young in space along with the rest of us , and I 'm not worth that . Brodersen mustered a grin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a war , and thisp252was how things worked out , and if I made mistakes , the opposition did too . It 's a shame what 's happened , but Lis and Pegeen both would whop me in the chops if I started whining about it . They 'd tell me just to keep on trying . Triumphantly went through him : Pegeen 's alive . I 'll see her again in a couple of hours . The broad door to the common room appeared . He knew no reason to check inside , but did anyway . As he passed through , he heard sobbing . He snagged a table whereon miscellaneous games were played , felt the reaction surge through his muscles , and hung anchored by his fingers . The viewscreens showed a total eclipse . Danu  --  which Caitlin had named  --  stood monstrous , not quite black but mysteriously ashimmer and ringed in crimson , while elsewhere the stars blazed and a visible pair of sickle moons went by . Mumbling ventilators underscored the stillness . The normal , health-reinforcing temperature and ionization cycles had brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of night . The inkblot shape of Susanne Granville huddled in a corner . She clasped a chairback while her free hand covered her face . The brightness from heaven was enough to be merciless . Brodersen kicked off and speared through the cold . " Hey , Su , what 's wrong ? " " Oh ! Monsieur le capitaine .... " She snatched for breath while he halted by the same chair . " I am sorry . It is no never-mind , " she coughed . " Aw , come on . " He realized anew what a sweet person she was , how much he liked and , yes , respected her . Almost shyly , he laid an arm across her shoulders . " You got troubles , Su . " " I ... I am sorry .... l should ' ave gone to my cabin  --  " " But ? " He held her a little closer . " It is empty there . ' Ere is the galaxy for to see . " She sank her head on his breast . In a short @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by starlight  --  and confessed , " I , I make the apology , Daniel , good friend . It is wrong I cry when they come back safe , no ? But  --  " Her eyes , her really beautiful eyes , caught his . " One thing . You ' ave n-n-no need for ' urrying about this . You ' ave more urgent matters . But  --  " She gasped . " We are lost in eternity . Tell me , please , when you ' ave time  --  what can I do ? " " Ah-h , " he murmured , scenting that she also was a woman ( without desire , when Caitlin was scheduled soon to disembark , but with a sudden extra affection ) , " you 're left out of the linkage , right ? " " Not forbidden . ' Owever , Fidelio and Dr. Ky , they do everyt'ing  --  " He felt her tense in his arms , saw in the ring of the Milky Way how shep253mastered her lips . " What is left for me , Daniel ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made kindly noises , and eventually took her to her cabin , where he gave her a sedative and a brother 's kiss before he left . As the door closed behind him , he wondered what the devil he could find for her.  |p254ON  AUTOPILOT , which observation had shown to be safe , Chinook accelerated toward the T machine . En route , her crew had a party . Brodersen recommended going all out , no stinting of booze or pot or anything else . First Caitlin , assisted by Susanne , made a tableful of canapes , and Weisenberg turned out some new ornaments for the common room , colorful objects of metal and plastic , in his machine shop . " Ladies and gentlemen , " the captain stated when his folk were gathered , " we have before us the serious business of getting drunk  --  stoned  --  high as a kite , boiled as an owl . I refer , of course , to the International Standard Kite , flown under one gravity in air at STP , and to the International Standard Owl , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one liter of hundred proof Scotch . " " No , Irish , " Caitlin required , and lifted her glass of the same to his . " Slainte go fail leat . " They grinned at each other . Though she had ached from high weight and battering flight , she had seldom given him a finer time than when she awoke after arrival , unless maybe he compared subsequent times . " Here 's to our noble selves , " Brodersen toasted the company . Most of their responses were nominal . He considered them . The viewscreens held splendor , Danu 's dayside receding in the sky but still large , the sun like a ruby , stars and the galactic river and stars . Nobody watched  --  not that that was the purpose , but it seemed as if they were turning their backs on the cosmos . Carlos Rueda appeared cheerful . Frieda von Moltke had made him royally welcome . However , tonight she played more to Stef Dozsa , thoughp255he was pretty dour . Phil Weisenberg wore a calm , polite smile . Su @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; nevertheless , beneath her face Brodersen discerned woe . Joelle Ky had taken a chair offside and was devoting her attention to Fidelio  --  almost ostentatiously , which was n't her style . Martti Leino had , plain to see , not been sleeping well and , no matter how he tried , could not keep his gaze off Caitlin . He 's in love with her , Brodersen thought . Understandable . Maybe she ought to  --  Or maybe not . I do n't know . It could raise more trouble than it ends , he 's such an intense kind of guy .... And what should I do about Joelle ? She 's got something eating at her too . I 'm not sure what . He laid an arm around the girl beside him , felt her supple slenderness , inhaled her fragrance of youth . I hate to give up any time I might spend with Pegeen . He laughed . " What 's funny , my heart ? " she asked . " Nothing , " Brodersen said in haste . Ha ! There I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's gift to suffering womankind that a night with me will instantly make Joelle purr . Joelle ! " Uh , how about some music ? From you , I mean . Now that we have you back . " He brushed his mouth across the wonderful softness of her cheek ; and practically felt Leino 's look stab him ; and no doubt Leino was n't the only one . I 'd better stop flaunting this that I have and they do n't . Only how can I ? " Well , if people want . " Caitlin paused . " No , instead of a recital , what do the lot of you say to a dance ? Sure , and there 's naught better for loosening sadness . " " We 're a tad short on women , " Weisenberg pointed out . " Four . Ah , well , Fidelio and I 'll be the wallflowers . " " Three , " Joelle said . " Leave me out . " " Shucks , no , " Brodersen requested . " Why ? " When she sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and whispered , " You always enjoyed ballroomdancing when we were together . What 's gone wrong ? " Her gaze upon his seemed doubly dark . " We need you . The disappointment at Danu was a stiff blow . If we do n't cheer ourselves up , we 'll be too goddamn low to cope . Please , Joelle . " " What about Fidelio ? " she answered in the same English . " Nobody worries about his feelings . " As if she had overheard , Caitlin called , " Och , we do n't need exact partners . A square dance , a jig  --  yes , Fidelio too . Why not ? They must jump about for fun on Beta . " She chuckled . " Faith , it 's very special this will be . The first interspecies dance in human history . " Brodersen queried the alien about it in Spanish . He was surprised at the eagerness of the positive response.  | " Then it 's settled , " Caitlin said . " Let 's be seeing how best we can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out steps to suit us . " Taking up her sonador , she programmed it for accordion-like sounds and played while she skipped about the deck . Her yellow dress billowed out from the swift slim legs , the bronze hair tumbled free . Somehow the sight , followed by instruction , did break the mood that was upon them . When the actual dancing began , to music from the data bank , persons even laughed  --  at first at their own unpracticed clumsiness , as when Rueda tripped over Fidelio 's tail ; later at jokes and japes , lame though most of those were . Blood pulsed warm again ; light sweating made them smell each other as flesh ; stamping feet , clasping hands , driving rhythms set them wholly aware they were alive . After a few rounds , they began to drop out for drinking and talking and different recreations . A ping pong game got under weigh . Caitlin sang her " Midsummer Song " for Weisenberg , Rueda , Susanne , and Frieda . Later on , couples formed in more leisurely dances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Frieda anything but , other combinations varied . Leino grew alcoholically gleeful when Caitlin was in his arms , and Joelle pressed hard against Brodersen . ) It became a good party . Around the middle of it , Caitlin found herself telling the rest : " Aye , we 're lucky , that we are . You 've seen the tapes from Danu . If you did not thrill , we might as well bung you out the airlock , for you 're already dead . And they are nothing beside the reality . I had that , but I 'll not be selfish , I 'll give you your turns at the next marvel , and the next and the next . If we never come home , still the gods will have bestowed more adventure on us than ever our kind had before . " She struck a ringing chord from her instrument . " And who says we will not ? The universe is ours , and I see no bounds for us at all , at all . " " Have n't you been composing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trifle muzzily . " Seems to me I 've caught you at it in odd moments since you returned . " He had not pursued the subject then , for she did n't like to talk about art in progress . That took away the mana , she said . Besides , she had immediately turned his mind elsewhere . She nodded . " Yes , I have . " " Is it finished ? " Leino blurted . " For everything 's sake , Caitlin , let 's hear it ! " " If you desire , " she said . A burst of applause replied . " Well , now , it 's not about us , you understand , but about the future , when humans all fare freely as we are doing today . For they will , they will . " She hitched herself onto a table , sat swinging her bare feet , and made ap257strong guitar of the sonador . The Milky Way in a viewscreen crowned her uplifted head . A bugle wind is blowing . It 's time that I be goingFrom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nights of moon and dew . However far I wander , My song will yearn out yonder , A note , a tune , A melodyIn memory of you . The stars are stark that shone so softAbove our darling land ; But I must fare away , aloft , And hope you understand . Where unknown suns are burning , Their living worlds are turning . A dance from dawnTo day to darkOn mountaintop and sea Goes everlastingly . Though , ignorant , we blunder , So death may drag us under , A note , a tune , A melodyTill then will sound from me . What miracles abide out there , What wise and foreign mind , What enterprises man may dare , We can but go to find . Yet still , in all the wonder , The tolling of the thunderThat quickens inThose virgin skiesWhen first they know our ships ,  |p258A  longing strikes like whips . I 'll sing while founding nations Among the constellationsA note , a tune , A melody , Remembering your lips . And when at last your runaway Comes back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me with a kiss . Hours later , Weisenberg explained he was an old man , and made a not altogether steady way to his bed . Fidelio soon followed . ( Did every sentient race need a periodic retreat into dreams ? ) Frieda led Dozsa off . Brodersen took Joelle into a corner , where they sat down and spoke quietly and earnestly . Leino engaged Caitlin . After he had made a point of ignoring Rueda and Susanne for a time , though she kept talking to them , the Peruvian smiled wryly and suggested to the linker that he and she refresh their drinks  --  after which he nudged her , his hand on her elbow , to the viewscreen where Danu glowed , and they drew chairs side by side . Lights were dimmed ; most illumination came from without , soft and shadowy . A speaker , also turned down , gave forth Bach 's Brandenburg Concertos . " Listen , will you ? " Brodersen 's pipe chopped through an arc . A pungentcloud trailed after . " You 've been treating poor little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We ca n't afford that , not in any of us . " " What would you have me do ? " Joelle retorted . " I admit I yelled at her once when she 'd done no wrong . I apologized afterward , did n't I ? What else am I obligated for ? " " Well , stop shoving her out of her job . Assistant quartermaster is n't enough . Caitlin 's told me  --  uh , this is strictly confidential  --  she 's told me how she 's had to pretend she ca n't handle any number of tasks , to make Su feel needed . T1tat 's hard on Caitlin ; she has her own pride . Anyway , there are pretty narrow limits to what 's possible along those lines . " " Are you asking me to make work likewise ? Dan , I ca n't . She 'd see right away what I was doing and be twice wounded  --  would n't she ? Besides , I ca n't deprive Fidelio . It was plenty bad when I took over the guidance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joelle caughtp259Brodersen 's wrist . " I promised him he could handle every computation which was feasible for him , from elementary linkage on up . He has nothing else left , Dan ; and he 'll soon die . " He regarded her in silence , the haggard features , the sculpturing beneath that had not changed . " You know , " he said at length , " you are n't really the steel-jacketed intellect you claim to be . " " Did I ever ? Not on purpose , I swear . " " N-no , I guess not . " He pondered . " Suddenly , after all these years I 've known you . . . Joelle , I begin to think you 're the most innocent person I 've ever met . " She leaned against him , not with the deceptive smoothness of Caitlin or the heartiness of Lis but with the jerkiness hg remembered ; she had never learned nuances . " And .. . you .. . are n't exactly tough inside ... either , are you ? " she stammered . Rueda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cathedrals and museums to share . The real pleasure came when they learned also they had small inns and cafes mutually . As she bespoke those , she grew vivid . She had visited Peru as well , but only seen the standard places . He relished telling her about others . " If we get back  --  we might , you know , we might  --  I ' 11 take you there , " he promised . " You are very kind , " she said . He spread his palms . " No , I 'd enjoy it . To be quite frank , until this evenwatch you seemed , well , rather colorless to me . I am delighted to discover how wrong I was . " She flushed and dropped her glance . Seeing that she had grown confused , he turned more serious ; that mood was easier for her . " We 're in the same boat too , are n't we ? Both of us essentially superfluous  --  at best , spare parts . " She turned toward Danu . " No , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expendable . It 's by no means certain I 'll be needed for anything similar again . Or if I am , we 've days and weeks to fill in between those occasions  --  we two  --  no ? " She winced . " ' Ow ? " " We must figure that out . " He snapped his fingers . A new idea kindled him . " See here , Susanne . What this ship does not have aboard is trained scientists . Laboratory- and field-type , that is . What she does have is a data bank holding most human knowledge ; not to mention Fidelio , who'dp260doubtless like to pass on his education . Why ca n't we make ourselves into experts ? " She lifted her eyes . " Nom de Dieu ! " " We 'll have to think a great deal , " he rushed on , " and study , and experiment , and  --  You a chemist , perhaps , I a planetologist . . . or whateveruseful talents we find are ours .... Su , " he hurrahed , " we 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boldness to tease Caitlin where they sat . " About that latest song of yours , " he said . " I thought you were dead set against any notion of sex-specific roles . But your verse describes man ' going into space . Shame on you . " She wrinkled her nose at him . " For your information , me bhoy , ' man ' in that context does not mean ' adult human male ' but ' humanity . ' Why should the lines not be from a woman outbound , and him left behind ? " She pretended to brood . " Oh , I 'll get back at you for this , Martti Leino , so I will . Only wait for my next song . " " I 'm sorry , " he exclaimed . His features stretched into lines of pain . " I did n't meant to offend you . " She took his nearest hand between both hers . " No offense ! Honestly . Do n't be that vulnerable , love . " He bent his neck and muttered , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right hand to his head , along temple and cheek and jawline and ear to the back of it , where her fingertips moved through his hair . " Ah , it 's a sweet lad you are . " He grew incoherent . His free fist hammered his thigh . " Caitlin , I  --  I resented you  --  I 'm Dan 's brother-in-law , you remember , and Lis  --  But you are n't what I thought . You 're lovely . You give . You 're adorable . " He grabbed for breath . " Pardon me . The whisky was talking . " " Were you not , then ? " she asked tenderly . " What 's the use ? " Caitlin moved to embrace him . Across his shoulder she spied Brodersen , his own arm around Joelle . They exchanged a look and , after an instant , swab-O signs which nobody else saw . Susanne and Rueda were the last to leave . They had been conversing too animatedly to stop , until finally nature required yawns . He escorted her to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Good mornwatch , rather . " He heard the nervousness in her tone , bent , and kissed her hand . " Goodnight , Susanne , " he said , and departed . As per program , Chinook 's autopilot set her in orbit at a distance from the T machine . The transition back to weightlessness woke some individualswho had been sleeping off their carouse . More experienced ones merely shifted dream-gears . Brodersen was in his office , running computations  --  Williwaw had expended a hell of a lot of reaction mass on her trip , and he wanted an estimate of how much more such he dared allow  --  when Caitlin came through the doorway . " Well , hi , " he said , gladdened . " How 'd things go ? " He saw the trouble that rode her , unbuckled from his chair , and catapulted himself to grasp her . She grasped back . " Hey , honey , what 's wrong ? " " Och , I do n't know , I do n't , " she said against his shoulder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went between you and Joelle . " " Oh . . . all right . Two or three bouts . Nowhere near as good as with you , macushla , but all right . I do n't expect it 'll repeat often . Frankly  --  noturndown of her  --  frankly , I hope it wo n't . I 'd a lot rather have you . " " And I you . " She shivered . " Wait , you do n't mean to say Martti hurt you ? " " No , no , no . He was clumsy drunk but tried to treat me like a glass princess . He could do nothing else , though , Dan , nothing . No matter what I did . This past hour too , after we 'd slept and the liquor was mostly out of him . He wept . You 'll not be letting him know I told you this , will you ? " " Of course not . " " Do you think I should keep on ? He told me no ; but she 's a rotten mistress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt Brodersen go tense . " No , maybe I 'd best leave him in his grief for a time . " " I suppose the same . Tell me I 'm not just being greedy . " " You are n't , my dearest , you are n't . " He laughed and hugged her . " Well , Pegeen , I am the captain of this Flying Dutchman , and I can dictate schedules . Okay , we take an extra rest before we pick up our duties .... M-m-m-m. "  |p262As  THE SHIP DREW DEEPER into the field that made the star gates , and thesight of Danu blurred into shining shapelessness , Brodersen wondered if Caitlin said a wistful goodbye to the world that had enchanted her , that she would surely never see again . Or was she too caught up in her ardor of exploration ? How he wished she could be here in the command center beside him , where he sat idled . Was there really a good reason for her not ? Well , yes , in her role as medical officer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was , just in case . Yet any " in case " was apt to be immediately lethal to everybody . Low weight came on a whisper of chemical rockets , for a few minutes . Chinook moved toward the final beacon . It was silvery in hue . Fidelio had strongly suggested touching every base before making the jump . All those markers taken together must have a purpose , must lead to other T machines , whereas it was possible  --  even likely  --  that the builders had not found reason or time to establish a construct at the end of every shorter guidepath . Many of those might give on empty interstellar space , as a purely random course around the cylinder almost certainly would . True , the order in which you went by the signal points made all the difference . Nine of them , the total around this transport engine , gave more than a third of a million destinations . Had the Others themselves visited each one ? Chinook went on the simplest and most obvious route , from the outermost inward along those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It ought to lead to something  --  if the Others appreciated engineering elegance  --  if they were n't constrained by external factorsWell , if nothing lay beyond this gate , the castaways would simply havep263to settle down to life in the void . Zero gee could only be tolerated for so long in a stretch , then weight became essential to health . Under continuous boost , reaction mass would presently give out . So it would be necessary to put a spin on the ship , with a large radius in order to minimize centrifugal variations and Coriolis effect . Foreseeing that need as a possibility , designers had included provisions against it when they worked out their modifications of the Reina class . The hull could be split in two , its forward and after halves separated . That involved a lot of work , only part of which could be done by explosive seams , but the capability was there . A cable ( of whisker filaments , for the tensile strength ) would connect them still . Under the impetus of the lateral jets , they 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motors would set them rotating . Earth-normal pseudogravity would thereafter prevail inboard . The cable would carry power from the reactor to the living quarters . And another Wheel would go whirling off through space : anotherprison . Brodersen grimaced , not for the first time , at the prospect of carrying out such a job with his inadequate crew . It was a sizzling hell of a lot more complicated than it sounded . Merely balancing masses in the hemispheres , let alone scrambling around outside in spacesuitsWe 'll do it , though , somehow , if we must , he vowed . And junk that rattlebrain word " prison , " huh ? Pegeen will be here ! To die at last . He made a gesture of thrusting away , and hauled his attention outward . The cylinder gleamed near . He wondered how it felt to Joelle and Fidelio , perceiving directly through the instruments while they piloted the vessel through forces that negated space-time . He 'd never know . That experience lay beyond words ; it was mystical , maybe transmystical . He 'd better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they themselves had no idea what they would emerge into , what they might instantly have to understand and do . And here comes the beacon , hard off our port bow . The siren whooped warning . The hull swung about and plunged . Chinook passed through . First he stared wildly around after a T machine . The heart drummed in his breast . He saw it afar , a staff laid across blackness , and the breath gusted from him in a shout . Next he grew aware of how much blackness there was . No stars shone behind that rod . Well-nigh every line of sight was empty of all but night . Inp264one burned a lurid blue-white spark , at the middle of a pearly haze which spread out on either side like wings . Elsewhere , well apart , he discerned faint points of light and a few small , cloudy glows . Motors off , the ship fell silent through the dark . " My God , " Brodersen mumbled . " Where are we ? " Action snapped to life in him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Report by stations . " Shaken voices told him nobody had come to harm , yet . Joelle spoke last , as if in dreams . " Fidelio and I think we know already what 's happened . It is very strange  --  " Abruptly machine-like : " We need more data . Accelerate at about forty-five degrees to our present radius vector around that sun you see , inward . Commence the planned observational programs and be prepared for further instructions . " " Aye , aye , " Brodersen said . A small part of him wondered why his obedience was so automatic . The Joelle he recalled , who liked him and indulged his wish for her company  --  even for what little of her knowledge he could comprehend  --  but always remained at heart aloof : she was no more . What he had embraced a few nightwatches ago was an oldish woman , yes , spinsterish , pathetically eager for him at first , then wistful in her stiff fashion , and helpless-looking after she fell asleep . Since , she 'd busied herself discussing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most of her spare time in her cabin , and been shortspokenat mess  --  embarrassed , he speculated , though he could n't figure out why she should be . However , her brain is still good , and right now it 's enhanced beyond my poor imagining . Weight returned . Brodersen knew at least a trio of grounds for building up speed . Doppler measurements ; improved sampling of ambient conditions , such as solar wind ; cameras detecting planets as streaks across the background of the stars . But where are the stars ? This system holds nothing for us . Until sure that everything was okay , he ought to stay put in the command center . However , unless an emergency came up , he was supernumerary . He fiddled with controls and peered at meters , trying to learn what he might . The blue-white fierceness which Joelle had called a sun was really brilliant ; the optics stopped its radiance way down . It was giving Chinook illumination comparable to what Sol gives Earth , but even at high magnification the disc showed tiny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ selective scanning and amplification , he managed to find a lesser companion , yellow , nearly lost in the glare.  |p265The  fuzzy patches scattered around heaven turned out to contain points of light enmeshed in luminous mist and intricate filaments . They must be Orion-type nebulae , close by , where new suns were forming out of dust and gas as he watched . For the most part , what had appeared to be individual stars were in fact star clusters , widely separated . Reports from the astrolab started arriving . Beyond range of ordinary viewscreens , but plentiful within the reach of the observatory equipment , were more nebulae . In a particular direction was a huge region , invisible to the eye , violently radiating in the infra-red and radio wavelengths . Throughout the entire sky was no trace of the familiar external galaxies , though it held sources of similar radiation . More and more of these results , as the hours wore on , were reached under Fidelio 's management . He told the humans what to look for , and they found it . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place Chinook had gotten into . Brodersen puffed his pipe . He believed he could guess the answer himself . It boomed through him like the toning of a great bell . Su being co-opted to do scutwork for the researchers , Caitlin was preparing dinner solo . Hitherto no one had had more than a sandwich , hastily snatched on station . She 'd gotten the Old Man to decree that a decent meal under relaxed conditions was necessary . In the ordinariness of the galley she sang while she worked , cheerful songs from unpretentious corners of Earth . When she began carrying things out into the mess hall , her music faltered . That chamber adjoined the common room ; the doors between were rolled back ; from the big viewscreens beyond , primordial blindness leaped out at her , the blue star ablaze at its core . " You do give a lovely light , " she murmured . " I 've seen the same in glacier crevasses and once a nuclear furnace . But what does it shine on ? " She stopped in her tracks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment 's hesitation , she nodded greeting . Caitlin went out to meet her . " Hello , there . Why are you not in linkage ? " the younger woman asked . " Food wo n't be ready for an hour , and I was thinking that then I 'd need a crowbar to pry you loose . " In face and body , Joelle grew rigid . " I am not required any longer . " " O-o-oh , I see . Fidelio wants to be alone . " Caitlin reached out , caught the other 's shoulder , and squeezed gently . " Leaving you the more alone . " Joelle yanked free of the clasp and made to turn around . Caitlin touchedp266her and said , " Please , have I offended you ? I 'm sorry . I was never meaning it . You came in here to see the view where it 's best , is that not right ? Do n't let me drive you out . " Joelle halted . " You were n't . " " I fear I was , me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But why should I ever feel sad for you that I admire so much ? " In a rush : " Dr. Ky , if it 's worried about Dan you are , do n't be . My faults outnumber the stars , but jealousy is not among them . " The chance phrase took them both aback , brought both their gazes outward into night . In the muteness that followed , a drift of curry odor seemed doubly lost . Joelle said at last , harshly , still staring away , " Thank you . You understandwe have had a relationship before , do n't you ? Very well . I do n't wish to continue the discussion . " " Aye , how petty we are , and our troubles , in this universe . " Joelle came close to sneering . " You were eager to quest further , were n't you ? Well , Miz Mulryan , what do you think of what we 've come upon ? " " How can I give you an honest answer when I do n't know what it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it will be grand to learn . " Joelle 's expression softened a trifle . " No secret . Doubtless several people have already realized , while you 've been too busy to hear them talk . Do n't plan on staying long . The captain will soon insist on a report , then order us back to the T machine for a new jump . Fidelio and I are keeping us going meanwhile , partly on the microscopic chance we 'll find some trace of something that may be helpful , but mainly for ... for his sake . Fidelio 's . It is fascinating . " Caitlin reached for her again . " And you barred from it . " She did n't venture to complete the gesture , but dropped her arm . " I 'll play the data back later for myself . " " Not the same , is it ? " Joelle 's look lost itself in the blue star . " No telling where we are in space , " she said low . " Besides , that 's really a meaningless phrase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it someplace in the embryo galaxy , and date it from ten to twenty billion years before we were born . " Air whistled in around Caitlin 's teeth . " We 've come through time ? " " Why not ? Emissary did . Ships going between Sol and Phoebus do to a lesser , variable extent . For all we know , the Danu that Chinook found may be millennia in the past or future of the Wheel that Chinook raided  --  though from a relativistic viewpoint , I 'm being very imprecise in my language . " What theory we have says that a transport field can not take you anyp267farther back in time than the moment of its own generation . But I hardly imagine that Danu exists yet . Therefore , either the T machine around it is ... was . . . will be extremely old , or else that field meshes somehow with the field of the machine here . The second seems much likelier . " And in any event , the Others must have originated even earlier than this . " Joelle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , are n't we ? " " Aye , " Caitlin whispered , " if the stars have n't yet been made . " " Few so far . Not many atoms more complex than hydrogen and helium . The gas clouds are still collapsing inward to form the galaxies . The suns will condense from them  --  " "  --  like dewdrops from dawn mist . " Caitlin 's being glowed . "  --  and higher nuclei form within those  --  " "  --  air for our breath , iron for our blood , gold for a wedding ring . " "  --  but the process has scarcely begun . What you see yonder is a young star . It 's so big that it could take shape with a single companion , out of a Bok globule , rather than as part of a cluster within a nebula  --  a type 0 supergiant , fifty thousand times as luminous as Sol . If we were much closer , its radiation would kill us . It has n't long to live on the main sequence : a few million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For a short while it will be as bright as the entire galaxy was  --  is  --  in our day ... before its remnant sinks down into a neutron globe or a black hole . The heavy elements created in that explosion will be blown into space ; they 'll become part of the later generations of suns and planets . " The star has a smaller companion ; have you seen ? It will be affected . What we 'll get , if humans and Betans know any astrophysics , is a recurring nova , nothing like the supernova but casting elements into the universe also . " I daresay a situation similar to this has already occurred elsewhere , freakishly early in cosmic history , perhaps inside a nebula . There came to be enough local concentration of carbon , nitrogen , oxygen , all the necessarymaterials , that planets could coalesce on which life could arise , even then , before there was even this hint at a galaxy to come . Perhaps one or more of those life forms evolved into the Others . " Possibly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what makes you and me up is being made there , in those stars , right now . " Caitlin smote her hands together and said , " No wonder the Others would make a gate to come see ! " " Doubtless . " Joelle sighed . " I 'd hoped they might have a scientific station . That 's why we continue moving slantwise to the T machine , instead of heading straight back . But I do n't believe any longer that theyp268have . It would be somewhere nearby if it existed , would it not ? After all , everything , including materials for the T machine itself , would have to be sent through from the past . That 's a huge enough undertaking for anybody , demigods or no . Surely they have competing claims on their attention . And when the giant blows up , it 'll wipe out whatever is in orbit around it , unless maybe the T machine itself can survive . No , I daresay the Others just come through occasionally in ships , or whatever they use , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " After a minute she added , " If they do have an installation , in spite of my guess , it 's elsewhere . We have n't a prayer of finding it , in a system laid out on this vast a scale . No , we 'll hang around for a day or two , probing , peering , broadcasting  --  a forlorn hope if ever there was one  --  and finally try another jump . " Because of how she stared at the star , Caitli n asked her , " You 'd be happy here yourself , learning , is that not so ? " " Not feasible . " Joelle smiled lopsidedly . " We 'd run out of mass and have to change over to spin mode , which would terribly hamper any studies . Worse , we 'd always wonder what opportunities we 'd missed . ' We must go on . " Again she hesitated . " That 's frightening . " As if to get it out before she could strangle the impulse : " Hearten us , Caitlin , will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , her voice lost steadiness ; never before had the holothete seen her that shy . " Can I ? Me , I , I 'm nothing but a bard of sorts . You 're a doer  --  Dr. Ky  --  an understander , a Druid . Our lives rest on you . " " No . On Fidelio , the way things are . . . at present . And you understand what I can not  --  Excuse me . " Joelle swung about . " I remember something I 'd better do . " She left with hasty strides . Seen from behind , her shoulders trembled  |p269JUMP  . Again heaven was full of stars . For a heart-stopping instant Brodersen could find no T machine among them . After he did spy it , made tiny by distance , he became able to look around him and wonder . A sun disc hung out there . About the same size as that which Earth saw , it was distinctly greenish  --  an oath of amazement exploded from him  --  and heavily spotted . According to a meter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thirty percent . The corona was immense around it , and ruddy ; without magnification , he saw flares and prominences like fire geysers ; but no zodiacal light appeared , though he stopped down brightness and amplified weak sources to the limit of his screens . Having taken reports , he ordered Chinook to accelerate in the orbital plane of the transport engine and research to commence . Then he scratched his head and plaintively addressed the intercom : " Hey , what 's going on ? I did n't know the main sequence included green stars . " The holothetes did n't reply . They were too immersed . After a minute , Su Granville 's diffident tones reached him : " I t'ink I can guess . Green is not an impossible color , but the range of surface temperature for it is so narrow that we seldom ' ave observed it . " " Is that why the Others are interested in this one ? " " No , I suspect it is simply leaving the main sequence and ' appens to be going t'rough a brief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the nuclear reactions moving outward  --  " Wait . Does n't it become a red giant ? " " Yes , in due course . But at first it shrinks and grows very much ' otter . That shortens the peak wavelength . Expansion ' as now begun , but needs time yet for to cool the surface , redden the light , while the total outputp270increases more  --  " She went into dismay . " Oh , you know the elementary astronomy ! I am sorry . " " Do n't be , Su . I should 've figured this out for myself . " Once assured that nobody had detected anything dangerous , Brodersen left the command center . He could n't resist peeking in at the various investigators and asking questions , but left before he turned into a nuisanceand sought Caitlin . She stood in the common room , surrounded by the views it offered , marveling . As he entered , she sped to him , threw her arms around his neck , and kissed him with cyclone force . He responded . When they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Dan , Dan , what we 're seeing ! What we 'll learn , aye , and do ! " " I sure would like to do something , " he grumbled . " This being useless gets on my nerves . " She cocked her head . Her grin grew mischievous . " Well , Captain , you could be dealing justice to a poor deprived quartermaster . Yonder sight makes me horny . " " Good Lord ! Does any sight not do that , ever ? " She disengaged herself and took him by the elbow . " Later , you can help me cook . " Reports came in through the hours . The ship was thousands of light-years from Earth , to gauge by the altered outlines of the Milky Way and bearings of neighbor galaxies . Identifiable astronomical objects were not noticeably changed , including monstrous S Doradus . Hence the date , reckoned from the hypothetical beginning of the universe , was the same as at home , give or take a few million years . Chinook had returned from the distant past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ radar ranging of the sun , gave the latter a mass above Sol 's . On that basis , theory gave it an age on the order of ten billion years . More precise measurements would be needed to refine that figure . Clearly , however , it must belong to an early generation . This was confirmed by a paucity of dust around it and by the weak metallic lines in its spectrum . However , it contained more heavy elements than might have been expected . Perhaps it had formed in the vicinity of a recent supernova burst . ( Could that have been the detonation of the blue giant the humans lately beheld ? They speculated mightily and futilely . ) It had planets . One moved at more or less the same distance as the T machine , a little over an a.u. , a little less than ninety degrees ahead . The globe was Earth size and bore oxygen in the atmosphere.  |p271There  was no telling where the Others had originally placed their device , except that presumably it was not in a sixty-degree position . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world , like the ones at Sol and Centrum and stars elsewhere known to the Betans . If so , it must have exhausted its station-keeping capability at last : for now it orbited as subject to perturbation as any natural heavenly body . Brodersen shook his head and clicked his tongue . Anything he could utter was inadequate anyway . " Well , " he said , " I guess whatever interest the Others had here died out long ago . Unless they care to watch the system itself die . " Soon Dozsa 's receivers cast a dazzling doubt on his conclusion . A source at the terrestroid planet was emitting a radio pattern which , though simple and repetitive , must be of artifical origin . A beacon , a message ? For Chinook , absolutely a summons . It was a three-day flight . Those who could do astronomy were kept busy supplying Fidelio with data which he integrated into an ever more complete picture . They were much too slow for him . He spent most of his hours in holothesis nevertheless , probing his stellar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps oftenest contemplating the Ultimate in that way of his which gave him a sense of those he loved being real within a space-time which unified him with them . Meanwhile the engineers checked Williwaw out after the stresses of the Danu trip , treated her to a thorough overhaul , adjusted her as best they could for predicted conditions , and replenished her mass tanks from the ship 's supply . Brodersen lent a hand whenever he was able . They had no room for a larger work party . Rueda and Su were left with more leisure than they wanted . Joelle was almost completely at loose ends . Waking very early in the second mornwatch , unable to get back to sleep , finding no solace in books or music , she rose , threw on a coverall , and left the barrenness of her cabin . She 'd go borrow the galley to brew herself some tea , which she had neglected to draw as private rations , and thereafter , while the Betan rested , get into her own linkage . It was awkward to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for help . That would be downright humiliating when she was unprepared to accomplish anything of value and merely intended to submerge her being for a while in the hearts of atoms and stars  --  in what was well-known about them , nothing else . It was n't even as if that state were an addiction which must be satisfied . Afterp272all , she 'd experienced it in fullness quite recently . Fullness .... Everything has gone empty . The corridor underscored her feeling when she emerged into it , a hollow length of metal curving away on either side , lined with shut doors , air chill and rustling . When one of the doors , Frieda von Moltke 's , slid back , Joelle started , nearly frightened . Martti Leino stepped out , waved before he closed it , and as he turned around saw the holothete . Likewise surprised , he blurted , " Good morning , Dr. Ky . How are you ? " His hair was tangled and his clothes carelessly redonned . " Insomniac , " Joelle said , because it must be obvious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Well , I have n't slept much either . Was going for coffee in the galley , I 've run out in my quarters . Would you care to join me ? " Joelle changed her mind about tea . Why should her face grow hot ? " No , thanks , I want to walk about . " She left him . Is that floozy servicing every man aboard ? she thought . If so , whyshould I give a damn ? What 's it to me ? At least she seems to have wiped the hangdog misery out of Leino he 's been carrying around these past days . What caused it ? I had the impression he paired off with Mulryan the nightwatch after the party , but no , he seems to have been avoiding her since . Did he think he was going to get laid , and instead get refused ? A quarrel  --  But she 's been speaking kindly to him at mealtimes , though she rarely hears better than monosyllables in reply . I do n't know . Nobody tells me anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know how to . Or much of anything that involves people . Eric made me wholly human for a short while  --  made me , wholly human  --  but then I went too far beyond him into a Reality too enthralling . I became Cartesian . A few subsequent lovers who were holothetes had bodies attached to their minds , but merely attached , as far as I was concerned . The rest were hardly more than bodies , conveniences , pets at best . Did that leave me vulnerable to Chris , beautiful sweet Chris ? To love is to be vulnerable , I suppose . Argh ! Nothing could have come of it . True ? As for DanHer feet took her up a companionway toward the scientific level , where the computer room was . Metal enclosed her in narrowness . A phrase came back from her Tennessee girlhood . Though she might be part of Project Ithaca , at the frontiers of human knowledge , her foster parents had sent her to Sunday school . There the Protestant chaplain of the military reservation used to read from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Thep273whole scene came back , whitewashed walls , banal picture of Jesus blessing the children , windows open to clover smell and hum of bees , her class sitting , primly clad on straight wooden chairs while the big man 's bass rolled over them . "  --  fast bound in misery and iron  --  " You know , he looked and sounded a lot like Dan . He impressed me tremendously , at my small age . I wonder , in spite of his being pious , I wonder if he may have been as good in bed . Stop that ! Joelle achieved a smile at her own expense . Why ? Is it blasphemous ? No , she realized . It 's dangerous . I dare not get obsessed with Dan , as I fear I am tending . That would be Chris all over again . He 's Mulryan 's . Oh , she 'll let me borrow him once in a while if I wish , and he 'll be considerate , but 1 know he 'll begrudge the time he could have been with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And that will feel so lonely , so lonely . I dare not admit Descartes ( as a maker of symbols which have no more scientific meaning left in them than does the Last Judgment ) was wrong . Reaching the passage she wanted , she took a route which brought her by the astrolab . Its door stood retracted on a darkened interior and she heard speech . Surprised anew , she halted . Carlos Rueda Suarez : "  --  Yes , I grant you the government of Demeter needs sweeping reform , and probably the planet as a whole needs more say in policies that affect it . But autonomy ? Independence ? Why , it is n't the germ of a nation . " Have n't I had vague designs on him ? Joelle stood where she wasSusanne Granville : " What do you mean by nation ' ? Is Peru homogeneous ? The Andean Confederacy ? Why can not our separate colonies make a little World Union of their own ? " Almost accent-free in Spanish , she did not speak timidly but with spirit and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You sound like Daniel Brodersen . " Granville : " I have listened to him and learned . " Rueda : " And thought for yourself as well , I notice . " A sad laugh . " Why are we arguing ? What can politics matter to us ? We 're adrift in space-time . Quite conceivably Earth and Demeter and the whole human race do n't exist any more , if that is n't a nonsense phrase . We 'll never be sure . " Granville : " Maybe we will be . " In English : " We ai n't licked yet , my friend . " Rueda : " Daniel again , I hear . Ah , well , Su , we 've talked about a great deal in these past hours , have n't we ? Life and fate and God and little things that are big to us  --  why not Demeter ? But when we 're less tired . " Granville , softly : " You have reason , Carlos . Also , the view is too lovely for disputations . Look . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew . I could go around in the reverse direction , but he might want them warned I 've noticed them . It was an effort to louden her footfalls , halt in the doorway , and call , " Hello , there . " The room was full of shadowed bulks . Light from the hall picked Rueda and Granville out dimly , where they sat at the farther bulkhead , facing each other at knee-touch distance . A single viewscreen behind them brimmed with clear darkness , stars , Milky Way , the planet a yellow-green brilliance and near it a golden point that was its moon . Caitlin had proposed naming it Pandora , since no one knew what it might hold for them , trouble or hope or both . Rueda sprang up to deliver a courtly bow . " Ah , Dr. Ky . What brings you here ? " Neither he nor the linker seemed flustered , though Joelle suspected the interruption annoyed them . " I ... I wanted to inspect some readouts , " the holothete said . Why the devil do I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did n't need to bark that question at them . " No secret . I thought everybody knew . Su and I have become deadwood , or at most very marginal assistants . We 've decided to learn specialties the ship needs , but we 've scarcely begun to explore what we might be best at . So we came here to play with the apparatus when it was n't in demand . " And fell into conversation which went on the whole nightwatch . How warm your voices sounded . Joelle shivered a bit in the cold of a clockwork dawn . " I see . Well , good luck . " She walked stiffly from them , toward her computers . Orbiting Pandora at twenty-five thousand kilometers , the travelers of Chinook saw it big in a screen in their common room . Under the glare of the dying sun , which burned opposite , the shrunken oceans were aquamarine and continents stood forth as brownish blots , sharply defined . A few water clouds were tinted pale olive ; larger were the buff-colored dust storms . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vast salt beds gleamed livid . Beyond one limb was the moon , scarred crescent , half the apparent size of Luna seen from lost Earth or Persephone from lost Demeter . Elsewhere shone the universe . Floating in front of his crew , Brodersen growled , " Blast it , we 've got to send a party down , or admit we 're not serious about wanting help to get home . It may not look promising , but how can we tell ? Beta would n't look promising either if we did n't know better . Right , Fidelio ? " The alien made a noise of concurrence . His eyes caught luminance fromp275a world as foreign to him as it was to the humans . Once Pandora had been of the proper mass at the proper distance from the proper kind of star to bring forth life . Plants freed oxygen into its air , conquered the land , drew a rich diversity of animals after them ; the yeast of evolution worked through hundreds of millions of years until a creature existed that thought and wrought . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by tides , it turned on its axis in almost a month . Its nearer moon had drifted far off . Another , a small body on its own path , appeared to have been stolen away . Long since spent , radioactives in the core gave no more heat to drive crustal plates about and raise new mountains ; erosion had worn the last ranges down to hills . Nevertheless huge drops occurred , where continental shelves tumbled down to the bottoms of dead seas , to crusted wastes and brine marshes . Waxing toward extinction , the sun had already forced much of the atmosphere off into space by heating and by solar wind , against which Pandora no longer had a strong magnetic field for shelter . Water had followed . The drying oceans gave up dissolved carbon dioxide , and greenhouseeffect sent temperatures soaring . Though furious rainstorms might still take place in some regions , especially around sunset and dawn , most land was parched and its winds gritty . The tropics might be seared to death ; at least , searchers found no trace of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been the temperate and polar zones . There , winters as long as Earth 's and nights twenty-five times as long grew bitterly cold . Day was always an inferno . And this would worsen for some two billion years , until at last the red giant filled the sky and devoured its child , before sinking down to black dwarf oblivion . " We 've identified what may be ruined cities , " Brodersen continued . " We 've positively spotted what could be a large ground base , which emits steady beeps , and we 've inspected the broadcasting satellite , which is probablyto simplify navigation for visitors after they come through the gate . " He and Weisenberg had flitted in spacesuits to examine the latter . It was a metal sphere about the diameter of Chinook , featureless except for pitting by micrometeoroids . ( That suggested how ancient it was , in this system where few small bodies were left . ) The men had guessed that transducers in the alloy turned solar energy into radio-frequency code . While effective , it did n't fit Brodersen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ More disappointing was the failure of any beings to come welcome the new arrivals or respond to repeated signals . He thrust his jaw forward . " Well , you know this , " he said . " Thep276question before the house is what we do about it . I claim we should send Williwaw for a sniff-around . Somebody must call here occasionally , or somebody may be on hand , waiting to see what we 're like . Agreed ? " It was . He put on his most genial manner . " Fine , fine . Okay , next we decide who of us goes . First off , me .... Hold on ! Listen ! " This is not a Danu situation . There the boat mainly had atmosphere and gravity to cope with  --  nature . Here the crew will have to disembark , or what 's the point of the whole maneuver ? We may need a soldier , a diplomat , a woodsman , anything . With due modesty , which is mighty little , I remind you that I 've handled a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Could be you were right earlier about the captain being indispensable ; but we 've been shaking down since . I can name three or four of you who could take over from me and soon be running things as well . Besides , if I ca n't exercise my machismo once in a while , I 'll go all soggy . " I have spoken . Let 's consider who else we can best send . " Debate converged faster than Brodersen had expected . Dozsa , again , for chief pilot ; Rueda , again , for co-pilot and general backup ( Su Granville looked still more anguished than when the skipper had appointed himself ) ; Fidelio , for his experience with xenosophonts ( the Betan gravely assented ) ; Caitlin , this time for medical help should that be needed ( Leino stood locked into silence ) . Pegeen  --  oh , no , no ! I really let things get out of hand , did n't I ? She bounced about , caroling . Pegeen , what if things go wrong on yonder hellball ?  |p277Chinook  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as to make it easiest for Williwaw to reach her goal . The boat came forth , vapor gushed , she fell toward the planet . Its darkling shield swelled to fill the view ; it was no longer ahead but below . Strapped behind Dozsa and Rueda , helpless , Brodersen reached for Caitlin beside him and caught her hand . She gripped back , hard . The next minutes would be the tough and perhaps fatal ones . Intensively though the atmosphere had been studied from space , it was not familiar . It might have any number of tricks in it to send a craft flaming . There was no ground control to talk her down . The mother ship could n't help , outside of brief and widely separated whiles , until she had climbed back up to a synchronous position . She had had to descend for the launch because of the radiation that seethed from the sun , against which the boat had no electrostatic protection . Brodersen 's palm was so sweaty he could n't tell whether Caitlin 's was dry or not . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Abruptly she twisted around to stroke her free hand across Fidelio , who squatted aft in a specially rigged harness . The Betan laid claws on her head for a moment , most gently : a blessing ? They pierced the sky . A thin whistle grew slowly to a roar , while impacts shocked through the hull and it often lurched . After a time , though , Dozsa glanced back , his own countenance streaming , and called , " Okay , we 've made it . " Brodersen cheered . Damn ! he thought ungratefully . Why do we have to be cocooned in so I ca n't reach Pegeen to kiss her ? Well , just you wait till we land , my girl , just you wait.  |p278On  a long , heat-dissipating slant , Williwaw glided downward across the world . Brodersen stared , fascinated , eerily aware that he would set foot on it . ( How did Armstrong really feel ? He was such a private man . ) A night sea rolled thickly under the small moon ; a ghastly stretch of salt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the plateau which had been a continent ; sunrise revealed it bare , ocherous , soil baked into brick , cracked and scored ; a dust storm was momentarily blinding ; along a dry canyon reared a few sharp , brightly colored tall snags above mounds of rubble . Had they been a city ? Dozsa started the airjets . Rueda navigated for him , at first by the sun according to calculations made in advance , eventually by homing on the transmissions from their destination . As they traveled northeast , the land rose ; the season helped too , fall in the northern hemisphere ; temperatures dropped and more and more life came in sight . Scattered shiny-leathery shrubs and isolated large plants , vaguely suggestive in their grotesqueness of saguaros or Joshua trees , grew closer together ; streams flowed into pools ; a reddish sward strengthened from patches to ground cover ; stands of dendriforms became a forest , whose gleaming brown-violet fronds rippled in the wind . Overhead , heaven was cloudless , purple rather than blue , with a tinge of green from the sun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoke . Brodersen must concentrate to follow his hoarse , wheezy Spanish : " I think the seasons are more extreme here than on any of our planets , biologically as well as in weather . Nothing grows in the long nights , nor in the winter that is approaching , nor , I would suppose , at the terrible height of summer . Animals must needs be adapted to this . We have likely arrived at a time of ingathering and feverish making ready . " Brodersen started to say that this guess jumped far beyond the available facts , but decided not to . The Betans did have knowledge of a variety of worlds  --  nothing like Pandora , of course , but a couple were included which had some resemblances . Besides , at present his own interest in the local ecology was quite incidental toThere the goal was ! Caitlin cried out , Brodersen and Dozsa muttered astounded oaths , Rueda crossed himself , Fidelio stirred and his iodine smell sharpened . Photographs taken from space conveyed little of the reality which was here . A city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of walls still lifted in a few places above crowding wildwood , their vivid primary hues and soft pastels undimmed . Where turf decked glades , great blurry-edged blocks lay tilted , only half buried.  |p279North  of the ruins stood a complex of several buildings , seemingly intact . Dozsa swung the jets down and hovered to let his companions observe . At first the structures were hard to see as anything but gaudy masses ; then the eye began to track the design and found a solemn kind of beauty . Hexahedrons upbearing colonnades fitted harmoniously into each other , around a central tower made of arches and spirals , crowned by a three-dimensional golden sunburst . An enclosed bridge soared between the outermost eastern and western edifices in an arc of bird's-wing delicacy that somehow also belonged . Two kilometers farther north , wilderness stopped , debarred , forced to grow around what must be a base for spacecraft ( and for what else ? ) . Impressive though it was , and in spite of being the lure which had brought the voyagers here , this offered much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turquoise-tinted paving , close to four kilometers square . Hemicylinders ( sheds ? barracks ? ) fenced it , the same color , their curves elaborated by what might be entrances and scanners . Near the remote end of the field was a large , dove-gray dome . Lesser bubbles clustered about it . A complex metal web rose and spread above , doubtless pertaining to the radio transmitter and possibly to other equipment . Squinting at the flat surface , they made out broad circles traced in it by grooves . Were those hatches , leading to silos wherein ships might safely rest ? That fine detail was barely discernible , for a slight waveriness enclosed the whole ensemble , like a hemispherical heat-shimmer . Tears ran quietly down Caitlin 's cheek . " Glory be to Creation , " she faltered , " another race in the universe that knows , thinks ... and they not dead . " " What ? " Rueda asked absently . He was at work trying to raise Chinook , which ought to be stationed in synch by now . " What do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man ? The countryside lies desolate , the cities fallen , save here where we see a bit of restoration  --  in the ancient style ; for look , the port before us is not of the same architecture at all , at all . Who but the Pandorans themselves would come back and erect such a memorial , after they went through the gate to a young world ? " She had spoken in English . Brodersen put the question in Spanish toFidelio , who opined , " That seems reasonable , fellow swimmer , though afang remains caught in its flesh . Why should they go to so much trouble formere  --  ang'gh k'hrai  --  basking ? Sentiment ? Yes , for mere sentiment . Datastorage can preserve every memory of the mother planet , for hologrammicre-creation at will , better than a few unused houses on this crumbling reef . " Dozsa took the boat out of hover mode and started her circling . " **32;5634;TOOLONG . Just , be of good cheer . ( I believe , yes I do , that my TV shows have done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) I must emphasize the sincerity of my loving tolerance , because it was so outstandingly successful ; my schoolmates , ever ready to accept a new Chatworth , voted me most popular boy in school . I was never happier in America . In this mood , I was even prepared to take a new look at my mother , whose sitting room had once seemed as gloomy as a convent parlor , and then as tinny as a rummage sale . She was the last of my family to come into focus , because I was so used to the blur , and I saw that under her whore 's makeupof religiosity , she was really a good woman . " Do you really need all that stuff ? " I asked gently . " Toe of St. Jude and so forth . Is n't God enough ? " Her reply was surprisingly vehement . " God is too much . These are the closest I can get . " Ah , such wisdom . I honestly could not tell you now whether my mother was intelligent or not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always off the point , so that when she blundered into shrewdness one never knew whether she meant to . ( She blundered into shrewdness surprisinglyoften , but that might have been the luck of the Irish . ) That night , however , she seemed like one of those apparitions who appear to saints and tell them to ford that river or plant that tree and a monastery will spring up on the spot . I decided then and there that she was a saint herself , and I still think so , whatever it means , and I think I 'll mention her name tonight when the amalgamated muffinheads give me their gingerbread award for inner cleanliness . Monty Chatworth sleeps in pajama tops for his own very good reasons , in an extra-large single bed . He has no plans to marry ( " And make a million women unhappy , " he says , twinkling ) but is seen often in company of mongoloid child star Burgess Fang.  |p101These  program notes from the Hotel Purgatorio in New York are to indicate that I 'm still awake and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there to polish off Mother backed up on me and I 've got a three-alarm headache . God , that was a disgusting performance . When the MC called me " a wit with a heart " I broke into that silly grin again and it would n't go away . After that I tried to be humble , but I could n't remember how it worked and wound up smugger than ever . Even the MC seemed sickened . Ah well , drinkypoosindicated . Now , let 's see . Mother . God , I met a platoon of her in England  --  uneducated girls hiding behind vaguenessand scheming inattention , working their crazy tangents ; in my mother 's case , barricading herself further behind religiousobjects . In another case it might have been tiger skins or prehistoric teapots . Wisdom ! Little did I know that peasantspirituality is terrifically upper class . And how better to win father 's famous heart pacer ? Shit . She could n't compete with his brains or his style , but she could really lay on that old peasant faith , before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old thing . All she wanted from me was some undemandingcompany and maybe a helping hand around the house ; and what she got was young St. Augustine himself , keen as mustard , piling on the religious hardware , digging up Coptic crosses , making even religion challenge . And to top it off , she had to pretend to be interested . OK , Snead , you 've had your fun . I 'm sorry I invented you that night in Fresno . A disc jockey needs someone to talk to , but not that badly . The last spring of the war in America was a good one for Mother and me and the Western mind in general , and even you ca n't spoil it now . It was much better than peace ever was . The newsreels showed tanks rolling through the spring mud and delirious Europeans flinging themselves on board , and the Chatworths were right up there in spirit , kissing and laughing . " They do n't show enough of Monty , " my father complained , but he did n't really mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , now that thep102promised land was in view . He took us on a trip to Niagara which was , he admitted , not bad of its kind , " though excessive , of course , like everything in America . " He parodied himself in his delirium . Priscilla joined him eagerly . " The Grand Canyon is fine if you like a bloody great hole , right Daddy ? " Yes , yes  --  and the Everglades , if swamps are really your sort of thing . One got closest to the plastic heart by joking , and Priscilla applied herself eagerly , as if she were trying to keep him alive . She loved him that year , and the air crackled with their lovemaking . I was out of it , I had no sense of humor , but I had something better . Their jokes made me smile tolerantly  --  that twinge of envy was nothing . Priscilla 's eyes were alwaysjust a little bit anxious as she joked ( " Am I pleasing you , Daddy ? Is that a good one ? " ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me by saying , " Mummy is an ass , of course . I ca n't stand her . " So , in all this bleak land , she had found nothing but my father . I , on the other hand , had found God , and believe me he came in handy . Of course my mother was an ass , I knew it all along ; but an ass is perfectly OK in the eyes of God . So is a half-dead ex-soldier with a bound volume of BulwerLyttonfor a brain , and so is a whorish sister and even a bloody-minded little boy who 'd have killed them all if it were n't for the loneliness of it all . The popularity prize at school was a final touch of irony . It was like crowning the village idiot and making him king for a day . They were paying me for all the laughs I 'd given them . I did n't fool those little Irish bastards for a minute . Never mind . Again , religion rescued me . Little St. Pendrid forgave them all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bags and departed . On the last day of school , they all , led by O'Connor , shook hands warmly , as if they had really liked him after all . Hah ! Them and their smiling Irish irony . At least they 'd settled scores for their damn famine . Meanwhile , a forgiving soul is untouchable . Chalk another up to The Man.  | ... Thought you 'd get rid of me , eh Plunkett ? That award was like blood from a maiden 's throat . I wo n't have to go back to my coffin for days . You 're lucky I did n't tear the plaque to shreds in my gleaming fangs . ( Actually , I knew it would only have earned you another award for integrity , so what was the use ? ) Now , go on with your story . I 'm not a bit sleepy . And if you do n't put me to sleep soon , you know you 'll be crazy by morning , do n't you ? Very well . Monty has won the war at last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with knickknacks , which includes things like long blank summer days at our Pennsylvania house , a burlesque of a country idyll as I wade through creeks and pretend to fish . I do not wish to be Huckleberry Finn , thank you very much . I read a lot , but am too proud to become the characters I read about . Still , a little of Huck goes in there , as in all American suitcases . Now what about the guy I came in with  --  the boy in the shop window , smiling , naming himself like Adam naming a new animal ? Can I reclaim him on departure ? No . The window is empty and the face has changed . I have resisted , I have held on  --  and suddenly I 'm somebody else . I took with me back to England a very small sliver of America , a splinter  --  made of a tumbledown village in Pennsylvania , some hot gloomy visits to Philadelphia , and an unlikely collection of school friends . Out of this I would eventually fashion a whole country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimes get it wrong . My America ( like other people 's Americas ) consists of a thimble of personal experience mixed into great vats of popularculture . To wit : the kids from St. Boniface seemed to me to typify the whole sprawling continent , yet they were all out of the same pocket ; they came from middle-class Catholic families that had weathered , or better than weathered , the Depression and could afford at least the lower depths of private schools . Doctors , insurance men , one or two farmers . The boys cherished the street toughness of their grandfathers , but it was an empty ritual by now . When I finallyp104stayed at O'Connor 's house , I found the latest in home appliances , pop-up toasters , foam mattresses  --  pretty quaint now , but that house looked like a palace then , with its pink porcelainwashbasins and fawns dancing on the glass shower door . The guys had nothing to be tough about anymore , and I doubt if O'Connor 's kids even pretend to be tough . Yet , you would not believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or my own tales of a slam-bang childhood . If they had really been tough , they 'd have broken my legs and bent my skull out of shape . As it is , they have only housebroken me . Nursing me with mockery and offers of friendship , they have made me one of them : a nice American Catholic boy . Or have they ? I am confused on the point . There is an Englishman inside , I know it , and I try grimly to summon him up as I fly back over the Atlantic now with my terribly English father and sister who have kept the faith without trying and are fairly bursting to be home , and my mother , out of place everywhere . Yes , I 'm looking forward ; I flog myself into caring . Flying , at least , is exciting . Dashing from window to window to see different aspects of the Atlantic . All rather blue , actually . My father rattles on about what he 'll do first and what he 'll do second . Restaurants , cricket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no old Puffy ; it 's an incredible lapse of the training school . ) I listen , now , a sympathetic grownup . " Perhaps you 'd better turn back , " I tell him . " What 's that ? " my father looks at me blankly . " I say , Pen , do watch out . It 's only an ocean . One drop of water is much like another . " " Perhaps you 'd better turn back , " my grown-up self repeatsominously . But my voice is killed by the engines , and by a pair of handsome teen-agers , careening off people 's knees , acting like the children they were in 1940 , erasing the American years . It is a long ride , and I spend some of it working on my vowels . " Whatcher cocky ? " I say to myself solemnly . " Bi ' ofp105all right , that . Blimey , crikey core stone ' er crows . " By the time we land , I am a chirpy 1940 cockney all over again . I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say to the porter . " What was that , sir ? " " I said , It 's a bit of orl right . ' " " Yes sir , very good sir . " No . Nothing like that happened . It was more gradual . We ate our watercress sandwiches in silence . The passport man said , " Welcome home . " It was raining and my father said , " At last . Real rain . " Priscilla laughed . The atmosphere is gentle and quiet as death . " I say , " my father pipes suddenly . " I actually found a bit of watercress in my sandwich . There must be a mistake . " His voice caroms around the tin shed . " Can I help you , sir ? " says a steward . " Yes . Take a look at this monstrosity of a sandwich and let me know if you find anything . " The steward peers into it . " Yes , that 's watercress all right , sir , " he says . First the rain , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do remember my father staring at the lumpy bread and the tattered sprig with real distress . " Must be the Labour government , " he said with a sharp laugh . Then he brightened , and on the muggy bus ride to London he cheerfully noted various indigenous plants , clamoring fuchsias and perennial aphasias grown only in Central Hampshire , actually , in a voice louder than usual . His years of diplomacy were over , and I became aware of a red-faced Tory gentleman I had never met before . We checked into a small gray London hotel with an elevatorfor two , manned by a dotard in livery who could n't stop it within two feet of any given landing . " I say , this is intolerable , " said my father , who was squeezed in with me and a fat suitcase . " Stop the Bally thing and we 'll jump for it . " Was he really angry ? He still did it facetiously , but withp106strain . " I could swear I spotted a piece of meat on my plate , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Must have the old eyes tested . " " The English have n't recovered from the war yet , " said Mummy . " Yes , yes . Of course not . Still , they could always take care of one at Willoughby 's . At least the waiters had teeth in those days . Must be new management . " And so on and on . " Two inches of bath water . Barely enough to cover the old coccyx . " Priscilla laughed with effort : Daddy must be kept funny at all costs . I was frankly bored and somehow missed the note of nervous terror in his voice . " You must remember what they 've been through , " Mummy persisted doughtily . " Yes , yes . But it 's no excuse for inefficiency . " His forehead throbbed and his voice was louder than mine had been as a child 's . " People used to know how to do things in England . " " But they 're all away at war , you see . " Blast the war . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ An old couple glared at us in the murk of the lounge . My father looked down morosely at his coffee cup . He was lost , but I was n't sorry for him , only embarrassed . I was used to his making a fool of me in America , but not here . " I suppose all the decent coffee has gone to war too , " he muttered , and Priscilla laughed like a maddened animal . I see now that my father had simply run out of instructions ; he had not been programmed for postwar England . For the next few days , he molders around like a dog looking for a corner to die in , and we all go on about our business . Priscilla is already blindly in love with England and does n't need him anymore . She thinks shabby hotels and toothless doormen are super and she awaits the dingy future with a clear eye . My mother the saint is glad to be back as one enjoys putting on a dressing gown and flip-flops ; after we get our flat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lives here ) she queues for fish and scraps of meat as cheerfully as any old fool , laughing ruefully when they run out of things . It seemsp107a better life for her than the demanding pre-war social whirl that my father surprisingly appears to miss so much . And she regales us with comical queue anecdotes and killing busconductoryarns . " It 's amazing how they 've kept up their spirits after all they 've been through , " says she . " The wonderfulcockney wit is still intact . " " I must say your experience has been more fortunate than mine , " says my father . " I 've never seen so many cases of shocking bad manners . Nor , come to that , do I care to be called ducks ' by wart-infested shop girls . " " I think the breakdown of class distinctions is one of the grandest things the war has done . " There is a glinting threat here . What grievances may be surfacing now that Father is weak and the rabble is upon us ? He stares back without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mistaken  --  that ca n't be contempt in my mother 's face ? This is my world now : you top people are done for , she seems to say . If so , does she feel free to go all the way and say stupid commonplace things in front of him ? Are the street mobs that close ? Before we find out , if we ever do , you 'll be wanting to hear more about me I suppose ? Naturally , because I 'm a celebrity and these other people are merely more mirrors . Is n't that right ? You want to know what the Celebrity thought about England . My parents , who are going through some grim death struggle in the kitchen , have begun to bore me frightfully . I tune them out and they leave my **28;5668;TOOLONG quietly , like poor relations , while I resume my lonely godhead , the wonder of Me.  | ... Are you still awake , Snead ? ... Yes , 011ie . Fresh as a daisy in fact . This is just like the old days . Your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't put me out now . Since they 'll be coming to get you in a few hours anyway , you might as well keep talking , brother . So be it . Frankly , I thought the English were ridiculous . Their voices you already know about . But the crap they said in them that year ! " Sorry , so sorry , sorry . " If I had punched one in the mouth I 'm sure he would have apologized . Or thanked me in a hail of " ta 's . " ( " Straightened the old teeth , did we ? Ta , ta very much , ever so much , ta . " ) And better still , they were all midgets . At a willowy five foot eight Chatworth towered over most of the nation . Wandering the streets like Gulliver , his pockets full of lead weights called coins , Chatworth struts . " Hey Mac , you got any Charlie Barnett ? " The clerk in the record shop cowers . " Charlie who , sir ? " " Forget it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " I am merciless . What has become of my loving kindness , you ask ? It has become very subtle . Love is an act of will , not emotion . I wish these people well , but I do n't like them . That sentimental glop I was wallowing in for a while has nothing to do with laying down one 's life for one 's friends , for instance . That , of course , I would do without hesitation . My father has absentmindedly given me a huge allowance and I swagger under it like a Texas oil man . I take taxis and mild old men open the door for me as I shower them with tips . " What are these thingummies ? " " Florins , sir . " " Very good . Have a florin . On me . " And buy yourself some new teeth . Ah , teeth . My father eggs me on unwittingly . " The specimensof manhood one sees on the streets of London these days . Oh dear , oh dear , " the old squire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . I am Maloney and O'Brien and the rest now , incredibly toughened by America . There is no menace here . That is the trouble with it . The air is occasionally pierced with cries of " One lump or two ? " Nothing more . Even the surly shopkeepers are like whipped dogs . " We ca n't do ih , we ' ave n't go ' ih , we ca n't ge ' ih , " they whimper . My father confirms that I am not a traitor . This is not the EnglandI left behind . After two weeks in London , we fan out in search of relatives . And what relatives : aunts who walk like Groucho Marx , uncles tough as schoolgirls ; girl cousins built like tractors , boy cousins who lisp or stutter and roll their rs . The talk soon turns to the new bishop of Sudsey-on-Tees . Not quite a gentleman , perhaps . Still , he gets close to the people , I suppose . Chatworth is bored and shows it . Nobody minds , or even notices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the restoration of Chipping-Gumbo Cathedral . Aunt Mirabelle is more taken by the return of county cricket . Nobody cares . Conversation is like five people working at different hobbies.  | " I see you 've closed the west wing . " The west wing indeed ! Eyes light up briefly . " Had to , you know . The servant shortage is dire . We 've still got Simpson , but after that I simply do n't know . " Simpson , deaf , pouring soup on one 's shoes , is the last great hope . Chatworth imagines explaining all this to Muldoon . " Had to close the west wing , do n't you know . And after that , we had to shoot poor Simpson , of course . " My contempt is undisguised . I rise from the table demanding to be excused . As the door slams , I hear Aunt Mirabelle say that I 'm going through a difficult age . Pah . I 'm going through a wonderful age . I march outdoors in an exuberance of sulkiness . Do not suppose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them are ecstatic . The air out here is soft and stupid . I want to punch it . These people have all died in the war . I am alive . Uncle George joins me , surprisingly , and we stroll , I do n't know why . " I suppose you 'll be going to Oxford like your pa-pah . " I shrug churlishly . " I have n't given it a thought . " " Well  --  it 's soon to tell , I suppose . " I give him no encouragement . My pa-pah , is it ? Get a load of that , Muldoon . " You 're very like him at your age , " he babbles . Amazing . Very like my pa-pah . Fruity toot toot . " We were surprised when he went into trade , " the old man says desperately . " Of course , he saw the way the wind was blowing . It 's country solicitors that have to shut their west wings these days . " Lucky to have a west wing , you old fart , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chatworth Manor before the war , " he snivels . " We thought nothing of house parties of forty or more . Then the army took over and left it a perfect shambles . " " At least you 're alive , " I say tersely . " Well , that 's very true . We all have to make sacrifices . Onep111ca n't complain , " says Uncle George , complaining . " Well , I 'll be getting along . It feels like rain . I 've enjoyed our chat . " One meaningless sentence after another . Go inside and tell them I 'm at a difficult age , meatball . No wonder this country is in such sad shape . While millions of Englishmen were dying , Uncle George hung onto his little kingdom and whimpered . The noble war effort I 've been hearing about probably consists of thousands of Uncle Georges fighting for their chicken coops . Do n't blame me , folks . This , by the way , is Monty Chatworth speaking , he of the integrity , who would n't come out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . OK , I do n't apologize for that  --  an Anglo-American has to tread carefully , and I 'll accept stones from only about half a dozen living people  --  but I 'm almost Uncle George 's age now myself , and I 've been known to throw tantrums over the room service in first-class hotels . George would n't have complained if his teeth froze in the washbasin overnight . So perhaps a man has a right to his west wing , eh ? Anyway , Uncle George had been sharing his egg ration for a week with this little pig from over the water , and the above is the pig 's response . Well , at least I always had integrity . It was the same at Uncle Henry 's and Aunt Maude 's , where the interests were respectively renovating the choir loft at St. Cuthbert 's and the preservation of game birds . Henry and Maude had closed down both wings and were sore as a boil about it . As for the famous English breakfast , the sideboard groaned under a load of powdered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could eat . My father lined up for it looking stricken , as if he were in a prisoner-ofwarcamp . My mother was , of course , repulsively comfy . " This house used to be much too big , " she confided through her bullhorn . " It gave me the willies . " " You 've become very resourceful in America , " Aunt Maude told mother as she actually made her own tea . I did n't recognize this for satire , and thought it pathetic.  |p112I  did n't know that Maude despised my mother and was forever out to humiliate her . These trips to relatives were like forced marches through enemy territory for Mother ; but now her enemies were brought low , and were living like Irish peat farmers . Well , well , well . As Father sat grimacing over his sliver of powderedegg , my mother bustled out to the kitchen to see if she could lend a hand . America had been the making of her , she said . " All this class nonsense . I 've quite gotten over it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maude . As for Priscilla , her fever for assimilation raged on , and she even found something to like in the sallow hermaphroditesalleged to be our cousins . Young Viscount Swithin ( do n't ask me ; they all had different last names ) had a huge collection of castrati records and so she went bananas over castrati records , squealing as if it were Frank Sinatra . Hortenseraised her own pigs , including a pet one called Quentin , and Prissy became more excited about this joke than the rather phlegmatic Hortense had ever been . Prissy was determined to get a toehold here , to have a real home at last ; but she had n't captured the listlessness of the natives , who were n't even interested in their own interests . Even later , when she caught on to this , her own listlessness was horribly overdone : too much gusto underneath . Another American tragedy . Me they all considered some kind of strange wild animal , as I laid on my American accent and my all-round toughness with a heavy hand . " What do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a fellow sixteen-year-old with whom I was supposed to " hit it off . " " Not too damn much . " " Pity . Elizabethan madrigals ? " " As long as they clean their rooms . " So much for hitting it off with Egbert . My companions now were Muldoon and O'Connor , and we had a fine oldp113time of it doing the stately homes . I suddenly had a comic style based on their old routines , and I was the only one here who had it . So everyone got their kicks except Daddy , who kept sinkingvisibly . The trouble was , he could n't blame anybody ; it was all the fault of the beastly war ( which he himself had shirked ) . When you find your homeland in senile decay , no excuse is good enough . At least , that 's what I thought he thought . Now I 'm not so sure . I think he felt guilty about missing the war , spy or no spy . I think his relatives , in these immensely complicated visits , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they considered him flashy . We wound up with the Scottish branch ( every family has one ) , and I was in the mood for something craggy and forbiddingto explain my own inner toughness , but I did n't get it . Uncle Fergus was soft and hairless and damn near an albino . His kilt kept falling down around his hips , giving him the outline of an over-the-hill flapper . And his accent was about as Scottish as Anthony Eden 's . Uncle Fergus , like everyone else who looked like that , was rumored to be fearfully brave . Group Commander at Dunkirk . Made tea while the bullets sang . " Oh dear , they 've ruined our best pot . I am vexed . " Stamps foot , giggles . What good did it do ? Everything had been bred out of them but courage and they could only be men at gunpoint . Perhaps seemingly sissy was just a game the rest of the time , but they played it ( all but the women ) with zest for twenty-four hours a day . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was preferable to that . Finally , there was cousin Cynthia . Lisping , lantern-jawed Cynthia , who became ( was then ? ) one of the great beauties of Great Britain . ( I still ca n't see it . ) She dogged me around on my lonesome walks , saying things like , " Do n't you think bores should be shot ? " and " Your time in America must have been super . "  |p114My  surliness went down superbly with Cynthia . " You 're better than all of them . I wish I had your guts . Of course , I 'm a socialist , " she explained . " So ? " " Well , all these titles and things . What do they mean ? My potty ancestor had a bigger battle-ax than your potty ancestor . And besides , he probably cheated . " My sin in that household was that I thought Cynthia was putting me on . I 'd learned my lesson all too well in that way , and I believed the kid was Muldooning me . I lost a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her family , Cynthia  --  ah , what do I know about her family ? I later did a special about the Battle of Britain , and the section on the unsung heroes of the home front was a classic , based partly on my memories of Cynthia 's family . Meanwhile , some home opinions . Priscilla : " Pen is such a Hollywood brat . Honestly , Mummy . Ca n't you do something ? " Mother : " I think I like him better than his cousins , anyway . He 's a man at least . " ( Never mind where I heard these opinions . ) Father : " Eh ? " ( I made this one up . ) Excuses ? Well , for one thing , their famous war effort had been ridiculously oversold . Me : " Did you suffer frightfully ? " ( Observe brutal imitation of that " frightfully . " ) Cynthia : " Lord no . Except from boredom . " Me : " But as the bombs screamed . . . ? " Cynthia : " What bombs ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on stretchers either , or gaunt nurses with lovers missing action ? No . Only a sheep with third-degree burns . " The war against boredom was lost in the first year , " she said . " We did n't even try . Unconditional surrender . Let 's all see how boring we can be ' was the motto . I promise you , there was not one interesting moment . "  |p115It  did n't occur to me that she was talking about some kind of hell ; nor that she might not be talking for the whole nation ( in those days every passing remark was the last word on the subject ) . Entwistle Castle , I learned just in time for my documentary , had been turned into a hospital for shell-shock cases and calmness was enforced for medical reasons . Cynthia had talked in whispers for four years , while they brainwashed the vegetables . Quiet country walks , an **28;5698;TOOLONG very different from World War I and Daddy 's funny farm . Once a bomber pilot had cried himself to sleep on Cynthia 's breasts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking for his crew . I wish she 'd told me that then . But people will blurt out anything for television . Excuses not good enough ? Of course not . The truth is , these people frightened me . I could n't understand them , and there was no way I could break into their conversations . So I did the only thing I knew  --  the tough American thing . Still not good enough ? All right . Let 's see . Suppose I understood them perfectly and did n't fear them at all , but was afraid of becoming like them ? Some truth in that . By the time I reached Scotland , I was using whole phrases of theirs  --  the mimic 's curse ; I was slipping into languor ; I was becoming once again the thing that Muldoon and the guys had laughed at . So I talked American with all my strength and blocked them out as best I could , and Cynthia thought I was super , and all the time the undertow of turbid Chatworth blood sucked at me until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself thinking  --  all these castles and titles and things . Not bad , Chatworth . At least  --  not bad to have that plus the common touch . Will you buy that , Father ? ( Say something , Father . ) At that , I was better off than Prissy , who had seemed to be doing so famously . On the train back from Scotland , we found ourselves alone in the corridor , and she said , quicklyp116as though it was hot information , " I do n't think any of them liked me , " and she started crying . Tough it out kid , I thought , like me . She kissed me , her only friend , and ran for the toilet , where , as usual , she transformed herself into a brainless ninny . We returned to London from our triumphs in time for me to sit for a school entrance exam . The story is quickly told . In spite of being the brightest star in St. Boniface 's gaptoothedcrown , at least three years ahead of my grade , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , guys , I thought ? Is Sir Winston dumb enough for you ? I even did an Astaire dance step on my way out of the building . It was either that or mortal embarrassment . My father was nonplused ( " But they put out a marvelous brochure , " he said of St. Boniface ) and in some curious way apologetic . He had planned to send me to his own old school , but he could n't very well turn up with something like me . " This is saddening , Pendrid . Saddening . " Was I actually an idiot ? The possibility had to be faced . All that Irish blood Maude had warned him about . He looked closely to see if my eyes joined in the middle . " My fault I suppose for not attending . But your reports from St. Boniface were so dazzling " ... ( dazzling , though I had made every effort to dumb down and be in the swim  --  an effort everyone else was making too , in perfect ratio ) . " Well , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ send you to a crammers . " Crammers , was it ? Egad , not a crammers ! ( What was a crammers ? ) I was n't that cocky . My father 's expression could still make me feel like a soup stain . Anyhow , a crammers turned out to be an outpost of Dickens territory long since stripminedby English humorists . It was staffed by what I took to be willful eccentrics ( English " characters " had been done to death in wartime propaganda , and had outlived their usefulness ) , who offered us successful examination results as itp117might be an abortion or a forged passport . Jenkins 's Tutorial Establishment actually bypassed education altogether . Their only texts were examination papers  --  all the relevant ones set in the last fifty years , with odds of repetition calculated and noted as in The Racing Form . " At worst , you should answer two questions brilliantly , waffle on the third , and run out of time on the fourth , " Mr. Jenkins told us quite seriously .

" The student body matched the policy brilliantly . It ranged in age from twelve to sixty and no whorehouse ever assembled a shadier cast of patrons : an Indian prince dripping in rings , a boy film star with the skin of an old man , a shabby chap from the Foreign Office who kept trying to expose himself ( nobody would look ) , and much more . Outside of the flasher , they were all furtive as pornography customers , avoiding each other 's eyes and scurryingfor the exits : probably taking the wrong bus and doublingback to Westminster . Among them they were sitting for every examination in the British Empire  --  civil service , Oxford pass , diplomas in gardening and veterinary medicine .

Within six months , I was able to pass London matriculation without knowing any of the subjects involved ; and by applying Jenkins 's methods later , to pass every exam that ever came my way afterwards . Hence , I remain a profoundly uneducated man . Which suits me very well . I think I 'll rest here , having come to a bright patch . Jenkins 's , among its other glories , was totally un-English . It belonged to no class and occupied no niche in English society . Nobody ever said they went to Jenkins 's . It left no mark , bred no character . It could have been in Singapore orp118Rangoon . I was relieved for a moment from cultural pressuresand the new Chatworths that regularly and dismally resulted from them . In that neutral atmosphere , I could be myself , whatever that was . I do n't remember . Only a sense of buoyancy and daylight . Not to last , of course . But let us sit down here a moment . I am , believe it or not , drenched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pajamas and it is morning . No more nasty thoughts . Snead has dozed off : I do n't think he likes England . As a native American , he tends to go out of existence there . Just a last toast to Jenkins 's , an old boys ' reunion of one . Miraculously , they did n't even work me very hard ; their incision into the flab of education was so clean , their filleting so neat , that there was really not that much work left to do . And I was not burdened with lead weights of knowledge , which would have been such a handicap in my profession  --  or , I fancy , in most professions . So let 's hear it for Jenkins 's . I have on this tape accomplishedmy first ungainly return to England , more hideous , because it proved that I had learned nothing , than my arrival in America , and I have fetched up at a good place . PLEASE , NO MORE . I am empty and ready for praise.  |p119Exhaustion  , my dear and good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year or two , but it blows in my face constantly , and I know how to bend with it , dance with it . When Mr. Snead shows up in his little porkpie hat with eyes to match , I know it 's time to put up the shutters . Snead , as you know , started life as a comic grouch , complaining about smog and such , but my wife kept feeding him lines  --  well , we 'll get to that later . Luckily , on this last occasion I knew I had some days off and I was able to get out here to Jersey and lock Father Sony in the closet and sleep for twenty-four hours , and my voices are gone . I wonder whether Joan of Arc ever worked on radio ? You can come out now , Father . This is my retreat house and you can sleep under the wooden bed . Now be honest : do you know anyone else who comes to New Jersey to pray ? Why do I get so tired , you ask ? Because being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And it 's Chatworth or nothing . Why does everyone break down in this business ? Because life is so dull inside a magic lamp . Every genie likes to be outp120and about  --  anything to keep out of the lamp . So we sign up for two movies at once plus a nightclub show . We overwork , because what else is there ? If I stopped for a year , I 'd never be able to reassemble Chatworth 's parts . His voice would go this way and his face that and he would n't be worth a nickel . That 's the worst of these foreign models . He is , even as performers go , a highly delicate synthetic , and he needs lots of light and attention , like a talking plant . So work he must . Unfortunately , he is getting rather too much attention right now . He seems to be in the middle of one of those insane publicity cyclones that blow up unaccountably around the mangiest of us . Since magazine sget their ideas exclusively from other magazines , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shot up in the air every few months in a barrel of wind and noise . But no one should know better how to handle this than television 's thinking man , Oxford-educated Monty Chatworth , right ? Come on Monty , show these rock stars how it 's done . They 're country kids and they need help from an older man . I need help from an older man , but he died . Anyway , with a little rest and vitamin C , it is n't too difficult , chums . Look at how badly most of the praise is written . Does n't that tell you something ? Out of town especially , they fawn on one blindly as if they wanted one to stay in Toledo forever . Big names , look at the Big Names that come to Tombstone . Why did you come to Tombstone , Mr. Ripper ? Did a friend recommend us , or other ? And then some reporter , heavy with years , will stamp your praise onto a piece of paper , as the assembly line cranks on . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here as a penance . It is drawn from my trench-coat days , when the very phrase " trouble spot " conjured up visions of Chatworth agonizing over it calmly  --  two reporters for the price of one plus ap121transatlantic heart that pounds and murmurs at the same time . The BBC and NBC saved a packet on me that year . So without more ado , here 's Monty . " The man sometimes known as the first gentleman of television , " writes Amanda Twichell  --  and I 'm not responsiblefor her name or her prose , " came to town last week to pick up the Walmsley Humanitarian Award , and I must say he certainly lives up to his billing . Monty must be the most unassuming man in a not very unassuming profession , and his manners are so good you can almost see your face in them . Ms. Twichell 's face should not be subjected to this sort of thing too often . " He says his native habitat is hotel rooms and his one piece of personal furniture is a picture of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother who must have been a real Irish beauty , and a father who makes you do a double take : because he looks more than a bit like Monty himself , right down to the small mustache and the gentle eyes . Monty sweeps it into a drawer . All Englishmen look alike , ' he says smiling . And the smile is twice what you get on TV : easily enough to light up Civic Center and heat a family of five . " Tell me , ' I say , as he lights my cigarette , plucks at the perfect crease in his pants , and sits down in one effortless motion , tell me how you feel about this very distinguished award ? ' " Bloody silly , actually , ' he says refreshingly . I mean to say , there are millions of real humanitarians in the world , are n't there ? Fathers and mothers making unbelievable sacrificesevery day of the year , doctors and nurses in slums , and so on . Whereas I , by way of contrast , am paid extremely well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you see , I get the award . " Why do n't I turn it down ? Because it 's so pompous to turn down awards . There is no grubbier form of vanity . Andp122perhaps my getting it will call attention to the people who do deserve it . So instead of thanking mom and dad and my wonderful co-workers I shall thank cancer research and Oxfam and so forth . It might help a little . ' " Tell me , Monty , what got you into good works in the first place ? ' " A fabulous contract , ' said this rather unique guy . No , seriously , I 'm a reporter , not a philanthropist . It just seemed that everything I reported on was a fresh source of anguish . And I felt I could n't just say , " Well , there we are . Now we 've seen the starving bodies and bloated bellies , let 's return to our studio . " So I began telling people how to help . In a way , it 's part of reporting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you feel some sense of personal mission too ? ' " He looked embarrassed . That sounds awfully pretentious , does n't it ? ' Chatworth shies away from compliments like a show horse before an impossible jump  --  because , he claims , he believes every one of them . But I repeat the questionanyway . Well , let 's just say I come from a very religious family and a very religious upbringing , and perhaps this is how it expresses itself . But do n't forget , they do pay me for it . " Yes , but you 've also taken some terrific personal risks , have n't you ? Going to the front lines in the Six Day War , dodging shrapnel at the Holiday Inn in Beirut .. " That 's different . That 's just my job . I have to do something for my money . ' " Oh come on , Monty . There must be more to it than that . You 'd get paid just as much to stay home . ' " He squirmed . Am I being modest again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down . ' " But was n't your father a hero in World War I ? ' " He did his job . ' " And is n't there some family pride involved ? Or at least a sense of obligation ? ' " He smiled , To the job , yes . You see , the sort of journal/ism I 'm trying to do requires live ammunition . You ca n't get somebody else to do the story for you . The best researcher in the world could n't tell me what dodging shrapnel felt like . I had to find out myself . Do n't call it courage , though . It 's professional ambition . I do it for myself . I want to be the best TV reporter in the business . Otherwise I 'd faint at the sight of blood . " You see , Ms. Twichell , I 'm so busy most of the time thinking about camera angles and such that fear is just a nuisance , like someone phoning at the wrong time . I want to produce news film comparable in quality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my studio conditions . ' " Did n't you ever want to be a creative director , an artist ? ' " He smiled again . I guess that puts me in my place , does n't it ? No . I decided as a kid that my art was real life itself . I have no interest in making up stories . Interpreting what 's already there is rich enough for me . ' " Has your transatlantic background helped you to see real life in a special way ? ' " He grinned broadly . You might say that , yes . ' " And how come you 're not married , if that is n't too personal ? ' " His smile vanished like a power failure . I was married once , as you know . Like most actors and reporters ( and I seem to contain the worst of both ) , I was n't very good at it . You ca n't take your wife on a dangerous assignment , can you ? One has to travel light , like a priest . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked if he was religious and he shook his head in one effortless motion , no doubt and said , That 's like asking , are you a saint ? No comment . To get back to your previous question  --  I have n't married because I ca n't find a woman who really loves suitcasesas much as I do ; and , you know , I 'm quite moody between performances . Like most actors I suppose . ' " I do n't believe it , ' I said . You ? The unflappable one ? ' " That is just one of my trade secrets . You 'd never guess ,  |p124would  you , that I am a screaming neurotic underneath ? ' he said urbanely . One short step from the booby hatch . ' " I had no idea whether he was joking , and for just a moment I felt a little creepy as his face came closer and he grimaced hideously . Then he winked and said , Do n't be taken in by my little horror movie . I was just practicing . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about his hobbies , but it looked kind of trivial . And before I could ask it , he was off and running again . The important thing , I believe , is to use the airwaves God gave us to the best advantage . It is as if He had said , " Lo , you have fouled the waters and laid waste to the land . So let me offer you my personal element , the sky , and we 'll see what you can do with that . And , well , lo , we have n't done much have we ? Even the air has been designated a wasteland . ' " This man , who thanks his stars he does n't feel a sense of mission , raised his voice slightly . All those immortal souls , feasting on sitcoms and ketchup baths  --  there must be something better , do n't you think ? But it is n't easy , you know . Our programs have to be better than better . We must competeone on one with the zoom lens and the filter and all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We must provide film as good as Hollywood 's billion-kilowatt best in the light of an occasional firebomb . And we must beat them , not just tie them , at literacy . ' " That 's fascinating , ' I said . But tell me , Monty , what brought you to America in the first place ? ' " Choo choo train ? ' he said irritably there is a reason for this . " No , I mean my readers do n't know much about zoom lenses , I 'm afraid , but they do like to know where people come from . So what brought you to America ? ' " Greed , ' he said , in that delicious dry way . Sheer naked avarice . ' " But seriously . '  | " I fear you 're determined to believe only the best of me . Very well , then , lies it is . I came over for the challenge . Is that better ? The sort of work I do would be done in England by somebody , if that was BBC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's up to me . If I can sell it , they 'll do it . That 's the policy in America , and I like it . ' " Monty can talk about his profession for hours , and will if you let him . He says that his life defies human interest  --  that it lacks the simplest ingredients . Nevertheless , you must have had a childhood ? ' I ask . " I do n't believe in childhoods much . I do n't like the past . It 's usually an excuse to bully people . ' " But were you happy as a child ? ' I insisted . " Sometimes . But to finish what I was saying . I came over here like a good American to escape the past , to join your marvelous melting pot . And the first thing I discovered was that if some kid started carrying on to me about his , say , Irish past , I knew two things . One , that I was dealing with a second-rate kid , and two , that I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Irish ? ' " The Poles , the Greeks , never mind . Luckily my acquaintanceshipwas limited . ' He seemed impatient again . Do n't get me wrong , Twichell , I love a parade in pantaloons and kilts , so long as they check their weapons . But please do n't bring back the real past . There 's always a history of murder in there . ' " Well , that 's very interesting , and I know it 'll give my readers something to think about , ' and I really meant it . One of the things that has made this man a legend in his time is that he has not been afraid to bring intellect to TV . In fact , he has practically ordered us to think  --  but so charmingly that it 's a pleasure . And I understand something else , and that is his unmistakable decency , which is as big as the outdoors and as small as the gesture of seeing me into my coat and calling a cab as we said good-bye . "  |p126That  was some gesture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the elevator shaft without it . " Wha ' the fuck are you talking about ? " were her last words . " The Irish never hurt a fly . " But that 's not my fault . She made the drinks herself , sayingeach time , " Don ' worry about me , skipper . My little of tape recorder never touches a drop . " Unfortunately , I thought she had clicked it off with her elbow as she reached for a glass , and I felt at liberty to be miffed . They had , after all , sent over this old bat who was way past live reporting , and who was writing for readers who died in 1940 , and I had every right to get sore and throw her out . Believe me , I do n't need the Mirror Sunday Supplement . Then , I do n't know , maybe she clicked it back on again with the next swipe . Anyway there it is , a sample of the praise I get even on my bad days . The point is I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ completely , because her editor was n't paying the poor woman to run celebrities out of town . And those , outside of the occasional sniper in Oshkosh , are the people who sweeten my path through life . So how can the weakest head be turned by that stuff ' ? Listen to it closely . Putting intellect in television indeed . By this she means those little intellectual noises of mine that are worse than no intellect at all . God 's own ittybitty element  --  the airwaves ! This is the very heart of my racket  --  like a dog act on the old Ed Sullivan show . Here , fresh from Bulgaria , is a man thinking . Shazam . And he looks so cute while he 's doing it . Really stretches the mind , you know ? Finally , as for the modesty : it 's like a bit of business you pick up in vaudeville playing the Palace in Sheboygan . I used to be so overwhelmed by the size of American compliments that I got flustered every time , and this looked like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here . And before I knew it , it became part of my routine : taking bows for my big heart and then taking bows for not taking bows . But it 's true . I could n't do it if I was n't sincere . When the mood isp127right , any old praise tastes sweet , does n't it , Ace ? Christ yes , any old kind . Even Amanda Twichell 's . And the flush and palpitations of pleasure do the rest . To be fair , though , I did like the part about the zoom lens and the filter . Very informative . So that 's it , you suicidal stars of tomorrow . Humility 's the word . Brush up your groveling . From Arthur Godfrey to Jack Paar , it 's the coolest form of communication , perfect for one-room apartments and stuffy motel rooms . And , of course , techniques have advanced remarkably since those days . Just as the athletes get bigger , the saints get meeker , until we arrive at  --  Chatworth the Obscure . Brought to you by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the head-bowing and shit-kicking competition , and looks divine in sackcloth . But what swayed the judges most was the talent section . " There is only one sinner and that is me , " he said with plums in his mouth . Is n't that something , folks ? Can any of you go lower ? Now before we go off the air , would you mind just groaning a little for our audience , Monty ? And maybe a little smack with the bat ? Actually , I could have won that contest at fifteen with a straight face , but by sixteen I was in and out of real humility for good . England encourages a damp way of looking at things and I saw in a trice that being the only sinner in the deck was as pushy as any other claim . In fact , any sort of fuss was suspect . Being a saint is n't all roses . Suddenly I could n't even be generous , because I would know I was being generous , and that would constitute a fuss and get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself out and do God 's will ( and pretend I was n't doing that , too ) . Even being empty was pushy . The sloe-eyed sophistication of my spiritual life that first year in London would have staggered St. Theresa ; or at least had her in stitches . I prayed without feeling , because feeling was bound to be false . Likewise I " did Good " ( not too damnp128much , actually ) without emotion , because any emotion would lead to self-congratulation . When Prissy and her weedy new friends ( do n't ask me where they sprang from ) talked about , oh , famine victims , I would snap , " I can see you 're enjoying yourselves tremendously . " They 'd look chagrined(amused) ; Chatworth has scored ( fallen on my ass ) . " Other peoples ' suffering is great fun , is n't it ? " I would say . " Especially when one has the correct attitude to it . " They 'd be speechless with guilt . " Oh come off it Pen , " Priscilla would say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Are n't you enjoying yourself at our expense right now ? " Quite . A saint 's work is never done . Priscilla , like my mother , could stun you with these fragments of intelligence , because she usually did n't appear to be thinking at all . Embarrassment , my old friend , farted cheerfully in my face , and I realized I would have to polish my act still further . Let them enjoy their famine victims . They were probably purer at heart than I , and could do it sincerely . Chatworth 's selfknowledgewas not given to everyone . On the way out , I heard one of Priscilla 's weeds piping , " I think your brother 's quite killing ! " and " I think he 's divine . Where did you find him ? " English people did n't bother to lower their voices . I supposed this was their way of communicating , since they never said anything honest to each other 's faces . Does Priscilla laugh ? Or does she say , " He 's all right " ? Priscilla @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For the first time I am lonely . Muldoon and O'Connor grow dimmer ; there may after all be situations where they ca n't help me . I even see them , for a horrible moment , unable to cope with a room full of bleating Englishmen . I am on my own . OK . I 'll beat them at their own game . I 'll outclever them with killingly priceless japes and then I 'll sock them with some good old American wisecracks . Honestly I will . You can bet your ass . Super . But this is yet to come . My brilliant , unparalleled Londonp129debut will not be till the spring . Meanwhile , I must play with infinite cunning to the only audience I have : God himself . One of my finest roles . Religion has saved me in America , when reality threatened ; but England was really a much better place for it . The light was too bright in America , the churches too new , the priests had just been unwrapped . ( Nobody ever accused me of consistency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hated them . ) The old churches of London spoke to my blood . They were my London . As a virtuoso in humility , I reveled in their shabbiness . And as a Chatworth I was , damnit , coming home : to a tradition as sturdy as any of Muldoon 's . I began in particular to haunt the Brompton Oratory at odd hours and to take confession like a drug . " Father , I think I have spiritual pride . " " In that case , you probably have n't . " Ah , what do you know ? I had long since mastered the double jackknife and the higher calculus of spiritual pride . I would still have to perform alone , even in the confessional , because no priest could go the pace with me . I peppered these long-suffering men with conundrums from the seventh mansionof the soul , and hardly listened to their humdrum responses . At that point it was still fun , because my sex life was practically nil . For one thing , I could not imagine such a thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moved their bodies showed that sex was not a factor . And I wo n't even discuss their clothes . One of our cleaning girls made a maddenedpass at me when we were alone in my room , but it was like being embraced by a woodpecker . By the time I had made out what she was up to , she had dashed from the room . I can still feel her cracked lips and the hand pecking at my groin . " Honey , take your time , " I whispered after her jauntily . But sex here was something to be snatched in desperationraids : it did not hang lazily in the air or hum through the streets as I distinctly remembered it doing in America . It did not exist in the streets at all , except for those darkp130shapes in doorways which seemed to be French because they called me cheri as I passed . " Come up ' ere , you naughty cheri . " Surely that was French ? So I had at sixteen a sort of Indian summer of prepuberty , further prolonged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You do n't have to take it that seriously , Pen . " " You said that about World War II as I remember , " I said . " Leave him alone , " said Mother . " One ca n't love God too much . " " But Mummy , I know Pen , " said Priscilla , glinting at me . " It 's bogus , is n't it Pen ? Come on  --  tell your sister . " " Perhaps it is , " I said tersely . " No perhaps about it , you old hypocrite . Old Pen loving God too much , fancy that . You know , Pen , my friends think you 're absolutely divine-looking , so you do n't have to do it , you know . In fact , one of them said , You 've simply got to save that gorgeous hunk of man from the priesthood . ' " " You lie , " I shouted . " Stop it at once , Priscilla , " said my mother . " Eh ? " said my father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . A sultry female argument follows , with my sister shouting that Mummy always takes my side , and Mummy calling her a " little heathen , " and her saying , " Well at least I 'm honest . " I leave the kitchen with a certain Christian aloofness that is peculiarly my own . But once outside , I know the snake has entered my garden . Which of her friends had said that ? I know Prissy is n't lying . Her voice is unbearable truthfulness . I ran feverishly through her collection of weeds . A sorry gaggle of subdebs and postdebs and washed-out gentlewomen  --  better than the men , but that was about it . A complimentfrom them was n't worth having . So , how about catching a late Benediction , old man ? I went to my room to grab a necktie . Was n't worth having ?  |p131Praise  even then was worth having from anyone ! Even in that terrible prefab American slang , it burbled like a brook . Just by itself , with no face attached , it moaned like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a trance . I was in love with a compliment ! " So long , sexy , " said my sister as I slammed out . What was she doing this for ? No time to find out . I caught the bus to the Brompton Road , still desperately rehearsing my sister'sfriends . Of course , it was a different kind of good looks over here . . . . Even that did not help most of them . But perhaps there were one or two . A girl called Celia could look pretty good if viewed sympathetically . In fact , she could look sensational . Mother of God , could it be Celia ? Benediction was an interlude . Or rather , with the lush organ music and the musky Oriental smell , it was a celebration . The gold crucifix was raised  --  this was the best and sexiest place in London  --  and we sailed into the Tantum Ergo . God would not mind this . Benediction was , unlike the Mass , a cheerful occasion , a get-together , even a little worldly and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But the snake was up and roaring . I knew that if it turned out to be Celia who said that , my Indian summer was over for sure.  |p132Good  old New Jersey . Ever since St. Boniface days it has been the place for me to go whenever I want to feel that earthly life is overrated and that all below is vanity . And it never lets me down ; in fact , earthly life seems stupendously overrated in Jersey . Out here in the blue , in my mobile home , my jet-propelled jailhouse , my little season in the sun still rages harmlessly : three magazine features in a row , and I 'm over the worst of it . In fact I 'm suffering from very mild withdrawal symptoms : why ca n't an article appear about me every day ? And if I 'm that good , why not a Nobel Prize ? I 've seen it with a lot of my people : gorged and bloated with success , yet their eyes burn for more , more . Only the best of my generation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? It wo n't happen to Chatworth . He knows too much . And he 's been to New Jersey . ( What 's that , Father Sony ? Leave you behind in New York next time ? Nonsense . Frozen batteriesare good for you . ) And now the two of us are on our way back to London ,  |p133the  world 's most unlikely comedy team . Shall we try a little preventive confession this time ? Dear old London , the home of crowds buzzing on Tyburn and of BBC cocktail parties . Why not ? It was in London that I made my social debut at sixteen and it was a pippin , was it not ? I also learned the English heart that year as Scott learned Antarctica , and the knowledge comes in handy to this day . It all began with the " hunk of man " compliment . My pursuit of that led me into society like a piece of red meat dangled under my nose . It was n't Celia , which would have been bad enough , but a girl called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a strain seeing beauty in Celia , it was damn near impossiblewith Millicent . Skinny , fashionably sunken-chested , with a sarcastic mouth  --  it was a workout , I tell you . Yet if she admired me enough , it could be done ! " She says you look like Byron and Errol Flynn rolled into one gorgeous frame , " said my fun-loving sister . So I set to work transforming this pallid drooping creature into someone worth my respect , someone  --  how about this ?  --  too delicate to touch . Yes , that 's the line I would have to take . Millicent could n't stand without sagging . In fact , she looked as if she needed watering . But if I placed her by a window in the moonlight with a veil of some kind , white as a ghost from sheer good breeding , I might just swing it . Chatworth winced when he saw the real thing and always would . This must be borne in mind in what follows . I never even liked the girl . OK ? Spring comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the English used to say . You are not to imagine clouds of birds in miniskirts . I do n't know where these came from  --  a new race must have been imported since the 1940s . What we had then were herds of plough girls decked in war surplus : ankles swollen beyond repair from bicycling , faces brick red from the cold . Still , they had broken out their summer frocks , withp134the faded polka dots and the crushed flowers , to greet the April sun , and as they churned along on their bikes there was a definite sense that the late war might end eventually . Milk-fed Chatworth , with his straight bones and his white teeth , felt more than ever like a prince . Nevertheless he was a social problem , because he did n't belong anywhere . He was a schoolboy without a school , and could not explain himself . " Tell them you 're down from Balliol , " Millicent would tell him later and this is as good a way to introduce her as any . I followed my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stringbean 's advice , only to run into a chorus of trouble . " Down from Balliol , eh ? What are you reading ? Do you know Pipgras ? " One particular girl , Prudence Harmsworth , who seemed to turn up everywhere , became quickly obsessed with the Balliol connection . " I 'd like you to meet Pendrid Chatworth , he 's down from Balliol , " she would tell everyone in sight . " No , actually , I 'm on my way up to Balliol , " he 'd say desperately . " Up to Balliol ? This year ? On a Breckenridge ? " So his social life was based on a fraud from the beginning . In this world of smooth pink faces , it was not difficult to hide his age : but an airtight system of lies was harder to come by . Millicent seemed amused by my predicament . " Tell them you come from Tuscaloosa Tech . That sounds fearfully authentic . Or how about Noter Dame ? " " Are you sure she 's the one ? " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glad to hear it , because to the naked eye , Millie seemed bent on my destruction . She spotted from the first my capacity for embarrassment , which she took to be deliciously American . For instance , one last time . " I thought you said you were down from Balliol , " says the relentless Harmsworth , almost in tears , while Millie smirks . See Chatworth squirm . " What made you think that ? " he mumbles . " Did n't he say that , Millicent ? "  | " He told me it was up to Christ Church . What are we to believe , Pendrid ? " Harmsworth drifts away , hurt and baffled . What is up and what is down ? But she will return . My sister finally fixed me up head-to-head with Millie by way of a double date with Millie 's brother Augustus . Prissy 's taste in Englishmen has always puzzled me . In any normal country , Augustus would have passed for a screaming fag  --  which meant that over here he was probably a Battle of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and totally dependent on italics . Thus " Who is that extraordinary little man with that gargantuan woman ? " And he thought it was funny to throw bread at waiters . There is a strange time lag after wars , as a nation waits for its heart to catch up , and Augustus was stuck in the middle of one . " Augustus , you 're too much , " says Millicent to this thirties mannequin . Fungoo , says Muldoon , faintly . That very first night we were asked to leave two restaurantsand each time I wanted to clap a hat over my face like a gangster ; but my companions giggled loudly all the way out . " I 've been thrown out of better joints ' than this , my good man , " says Augustus to a resigned maitre d ' . " A bordelloin Singapore , to name one at random . " Augustus reaches for the wrong hat , a huge derby in which his thin blonde head swims . " Come , my little chickadee , " he says to Prissy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He reaches over the hatcheck girl 's head again and grabs an umbrella which he opens for Prissy . " Where am I ? Borneo ? Rangoon , you say ? Somewhere in the veldt ? You , sir , " he says to a bouncer who is looming , " are a particularly fine specimen , a credit to your plucky little people . " Pause . " Just a word to the wise : a bar of soap could make all the difference . " " You do n't want me to call the police , do you , sir ? " " You 're absolutely right . I 'll drink to that . " Augustus shakes hands with the bouncer . " Here , I want to give you a gift from my people . " He puts the derby on the bouncer'sp136head , where it perches like a thimble . " Here 's your crown  --  and here 's your blooming scepter . He hands over the umbreph andohdear. " u He stood on thehimsidewalk laughingmirthlessly , and Millie and Prissy were patting his back andkll'it " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to croak t something , I suppose , about watching for the cops ; not owing that I now belonged to a charmed class and that the odd was my nursery , too , if I wanted it . W . ' shall we try Churchill 's ? " said Augustus , suddenlyred. bo. , It 's past Pen 's bedtime , " said Priscilla , and then looked thehorrified ; it wasfinal kick in the arilgy y the next day would do no good . We ehomeapololiKe refugees and went to bed . I assumed that I had seen the last of the Marchbanks . Irey disgusted me , and my sympathies were by now all with the bouncer , who was at least an honest working man ; in fait , I wished he had mashed the hat over Gus 's yellow hair and stuffed the umbrella up his ass . An American would have . The English were n't ready for democracy . I raged at them doubly because I had failed altogether to .0press them . My few interventions had been received in fence . I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's " Straight and I could n't figure out how the English joke : worked ( there was no question of saying anything serious ) . since they laughed at everything else in sight , I was crushed . Babies . Parasites . I did n't even like their damn jokes . All I could hear was the constant wheezing of Gus 's machinery . ; et some quality in me , which I would like to disown right here , was already beginning to learn the jokes , master them ; and they are now , as everyone knows , part of my repertoire . priscilla surprised me a couple of days later by saying that She and the Marchbanks were going punting , whatever that meant , and would all love me to join them.  | " Oh , come on . They ca n't stand me and you know it , " I said . " You 're kidding , " said Priss . " Millie thinks you 're absolutelydelicious . Scrummy enough to eat . " Scrummy ? " She certainly keeps it under her hat , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you 'll agree that her lousy brother actively detests me . " " No , no . Wrong again . Augustus thinks you 're jolly good value . It just takes time to understand these people . " No one had looked blanker , could have looked blanker , than Augustus , whenever I spoke . But Priss explained this . " He says that you have a dry Yankee wit . One does n't see the point right away . Then one simply roars . " " One does ? " " Yes one does . " Well , well , well . So that was the old meal ticket , eh ? The old gravy train . Dry American wit ? Coming right up , ma'am . With tassels on . If I can just remember how to do it . Thus the four of us began our Season , Augustus looking bored as ever , but no doubt roaring when he got home , and Millie concealing her admiration with Teutonic thoroughness . I could n't go with them to the big stuff of course , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for minor parties in Chelsea and church benefits , where brothers danced with sisters and large-boned girls tried not to lead each other . My parents did n't seem to mind if I stayed out all night as long as Priscilla was around . So we remained a team . What was in it for the Marchbanks ? I began to think that upper-class Englishmen had no real motives at all . It would be a terrible breach of form to actually want to do something : how then could one complain of this dreadful dance and those awful people ? Only those things that were genuinely awful were ever praised , i.e. , deliciously bad Westerns , gorgeouslybad taste . Teen-aged sociologists can be brutal ; after all , they are fighting for their lives . Easy to make fun of thep138limeys , eh Muldoon ? Wrong again . They are making fun of themselves . Augustus , for instance , knows that Englishmen dance badly , bobbing up and down as though an actual fox were the object ; so he dances outrageously badly , until criticism is stunned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tools of seduction , has become a stage vamp . " Be kind , Pen . I bruise easily , " she purrs . " Those eyes . They frighten me sometimes . " Is that the supply the compliment came from ? There is no feeling in this girl . Yet Prissy insists she is more crackers about me than ever . " That 's her way of expressingit . You know how it is when the English try to show emotion . " The truth is , Prissy is as much at sea with these people as I am . She is bluffing . She leads roars of laughter that go nowhere . Yet could she be onto something ? Millicent is quite different with her . The two of them often drop away from the general conversation and talk to each other with solemn animation . Dull stuff , from what I catch of it , but sincere . Perhaps then the aching , grinding flippancy is confined to cross-sexual encounters ? Ah ha . I decide to plow on . Millie still rather desperately molds little jokes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she calls me ; and I overhearher talking about my days at a logging camp in the Klondike . " Boots ' Chatworth they called him . Do n't be put off by the babyish appearance . That boy can lick his weight in bobcats . Ca n't you , love ? " she sees me hovering . Another time , I am the youngest man to have graduated magna cum laude from Harvard , a scientific wiz ahead of my century . " Tell them about all those marvelous equations and things , " she says . She is scraping bottom and she knows it , and my vein of embarrassment is about played out . In front of the others she has a demonic fluency , but her vamping grinds to a halt when we are alone , and she is awkward as a schoolgirl . Hah , perhaps that 's it . She has been at convent school all of her conscious life , and has never metp139a man before , except through a grille . When Gus and Priss leave the table , she is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or failing that , bulling her way to the ladies ' room . Dancing 's all right . It means she 's up and doing . It 's almost as good as field hockey , now that she 's got the hang of it . I laugh at her . I can handle this tomato . I concede Millicent the public arena and use the time to concentrate on my moves . Chatworth can not yet compete with the babble of tongues ; his voice is pitched wrong and he 's not even sure they hear him . So I work on my cigarette lighting , door opening , eyebrow raising  --  a hectic schedule , it turns out . I learn how to look too bored to talk , and suspect that half of them are doing the same . I learn to dance from their mistakes . Much of the famous Chatworth style , which now seems bred in the bone , is acquired in that sweatshop in a couple of months . Alone with Millicent , I adopt a dazzling new tactic . I , a male , am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her plans and dreams , until a look of terror comes into her eyes . In front of a crowd , she 'd have cut me to pieces . " Dreams , old boy ? A cottage for two somewhere in the blue  --  that sort of thing ? " But alone , she can barely croak out , " I 'm really not sure , " or " Daddy does n't believe in universities for women , " before making her getaway to the ladies ' room . The more she dreads our tete-a-tetes , the more masterful I feel . As she gazes around wildly for Priscilla to rescue her , I practice smiling through locked jaws and other local tricks . I even practice not smoking before the Queen is toasted . The hours fairly race by in this fashion . She is really waiting for Jungle Boy to pounce and save her from her shyness . We have kissed good night a few times , and she has a lot to learn from the kid from Wilkes-Barre . Her lips are sealed cold and she looks at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She is never more vulnerable , or more lovable . I do n't care how much she makes fun of me so long as Ip140can have those moments . As the evening draws on , her mockery grows frantic , then trails off : she knows she will have to face the Moment , the first heavy pass from Jungle Boy  --  and she will do at least twenty-five things wrong . It will be infinitely worse than the first fox trot at Lord Bunce 's coming-out party . Yet one must press on . I 'm sorry , but I loved her in this state of fear before the kiss , with all her arrogance unraveled . In those days it did n't seem so awful to love women in this way . I tell myself I 've changed since then , that I do n't need that look of fear anymore , the trapped stare of someone caught in the headlights of a car , but I really do n't know . Soon enough , she came to understand that the good-night kiss was all that was going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least she responded now with wintry gusto , pressing my hand in a businesslike way  --  there , that 's done . Good night , little man . I realized I would have to raise the dose or lose my status and revert to my role of unidentified schoolboy . I suppose I could have stood that . Time would have cured it . But I needed her fear , the way I 'd needed Morton Green 's back at St. Boniface . I 'm not a bully , am I ? Let me show you my philanthropy award . I needed her fear the way one wants a neat woman to unfasten her hair . I wanted her to strip off her goddamned English armor , with the cute sayings on it , and join me on the jungle floor . There was , however , one catch to all this  --  outside of her own fantastic footwork at the front door . I was a Catholic and could not do such a thing lightly . I have forgotten my theological ruminations out of very shame , but I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything at all in those days I had to work out the explanation . In this case what it boiled down to finally was that I had to get a little bit drunk and out of control before I could administer the coup de grace . Not as easy as you might think . " Am I out of control yet ? No , damnit . Nother little glass of cham/pagne . Now I 'm out of control . Oh Jesus , I ca n't even stand up . " The margin for innocent sin is razor thin . Throwing up on Millicent 's dress in a punt on the Thames would not seem the best way to break the ice . But it did , just like that . Places please , for a burst of romance . We are bobbingunder the pussy willows , and a slight nudge of mal de mer has put me over the edge . No way she can stuff me into a cab this time , so she holds my poisoned head in the shamblesof her lap and caresses it gently and I realize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ potency . I begin to feel woozy stirrings in the pit . Until now I have loved nothing about her except her fear of me . Suddenly I have something else : she is nursing me through a bout of embarrassment . No one has ever done that before  --  Mother , Father , the rock-voiced men in the box . " Thank you , " I say , trying to kiss her through her frock , and drooling on the cotton daisies . " Made an awful ass of myself . " " That 's all right . " She is at ease now too . The necking contest is over . Or so she thinks . Not so sure I like this . My headache goes spinning off in a new direction . Am I still out of control ? Why not ? The sin has been in the planning : utter spontaneity is the ticket now . I undo my trousers roughly with one hand , popping buttons wantonly , and paw the air around her with the other . I 'll show her Jungle Boy is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can still sense the thin face looking down at me . I could n't see it then , because I was burrowing artlessly under her skirt , doing fine as far as I could tell ; but I could feel her hand go stiff on the back of my neck . My own advance hand had reached something dry and wiry  --  was this the place ? At any moment she would go hog wild , if my reading was anything to go by . My need to keep everything spontaneous in the eyes of the Lord kept me hurrying along . Rub-a-dubdub . I mock myself . Everyone has trouble the first time . Why can I barely face this scene ?  |p142After  several minutes , I saw that my reading had been a tissue of lies , and I supposed I 'd just better push ahead with the next part . I looked up at her face and was surprised to see that her eyes were shut tight . Was one supposed to say something ? What was the protocol ? I made some sort of endearing mumble as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and began to swarm forward . Her eyes opened  --  with what ? Fear , contempt , apology ? What is that look ? I ca n't see it . " I think you 'd better put that away . " It does n't matter how that is said , does it ? I looked down at " that . " The eager red-faced moron did not know that the chase was off . I have always suspected its sanity . " I 'm afraid it 's not my sort of thing , " she said . Do n't apologize to me , you freak . I was miserable and wet with rage . There is no sadness like unto a Catholic boy who has committed a sin with nothing to show for it . " What is your sort of thing ? " I snarled . There is a silence , except for the lapping of water , which sounds like waves crashing now . There is no crowd to appeal to , no montage of Prissy and Augustus walking to our table laughing . The rescue team . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ willful Peeping Tom can find us , and he would n't be of much help . She is trapped with me . Now this is another thing I do n't remember exactly . Was she polite , and did she say , " Are you sure you want to know ? You Americans are so idealistic . " ( In which case I cry hoarsely , " I want the truth , damn you ! " ) Or did she decide to cut me off brutally and be rid of me forever ? It 's not important , perhaps . In both versions , what she says eventually is , " I think my sort of thing might be your sister . " Dry heaves now into the willows , but furious mental activitytoo . I am not thinking of Prissy as such  --  that will come later  --  but of me . Millie has been going with me so that she can be close to Prissy . So where the hell does that leave Gus ?  |p143Ohmygod   --  it 's not possible . Not with Old Jolly Good Value here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with sheer will power and look around savagely . " And what is Gus 's sort of thing ? " " I really do n't know , " she says vaguely . Waves a hand . " I 'm not sure he has a sort of thing . " Lost it in the war , no doubt . Poor chap . She looks away , as if on director 's instructions . You must admit the English make jolly good actors . She adds as a sort of afterthought , " Me , perhaps . " This is too grotesque to be shocking . I presume I am open-mouthed . She feels a social obligation to talk . " I 'm sorry to be so desperately Henry James about the whole thing  --  us corrupt Europeans taking advantage of you innocent Americans sort of thing . I 'm sure that if you lusted after Priscilla you would repress it fiercely . And quite right too . " My God , how did she know ? These people were so damn clever , that was the worst of it . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suppose I 've led you on . I did n't mean to . I think I really hoped something might happen between us . I thought you were rather super . " Her skirt was still hiked up . That was nice . It took real class not to yank it down primly . Maybe I ought to give it one more try . I still have one sin coming on the house . She shook her head and pulled the skirt down slowly . So damn clever . " Here , put your head on my lap . I like that . And Pendrid ? Let 's be friends . " " What ? " I bellowed forlornly . " Fucking no OK to that . " She shrugged . Have it your way , sonny . That 's what comes of being polite to these people . " Shall I do the punting ? " she says . Chatworth nods . He ca n't punt his hat.  |p144I  must warn Prissy about these people at once . Then I must change my life . Request permission to leave this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fast , Mac . " You 're going the wrong way . Your mind is packed for London . This is no threadbare Kafka official blocking my way , but a streamlined FBI man with shoulders out to here . " Have you a history of syphilis or communism , sir ? " I must wait . Crouched in the back of the punt , with Millicentpaddling me home . I see , through a vapor of vomit , a slick cool creature with a half smile of utter triumph . She has annihilated another brutish male . Only now do I imagine Millicent holding back tears , but that 's just my conscience having a little fun . A couple of years later she tried to kill herself , but that had nothing to do with me . I can not take on all the sins of the universe . All I know is , she looked like Lord Runcible whipping a fuzzywuzzyas we punted back to the Henley boat station , and I was too hung over and miserable to look beyond this . I wasp145the one with feelings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oversight and I now see her crying for days , wasting , preparing her suicide . Thus do I scourge and flatter myself . To repeat , I must warn Prissy about these people , and then change my life . I rush for the Brompton Oratory and pray with a comic intensity worthy of Buster Keaton . I confess at a gabble ( did the priest hear a word ? I hope not ) and race back to my pew for some real two-fisted remorse . Yes , I have lusted after Prissy , I have taken one step in their abominable English direction : Millicent in her leering decadence has seen into my heart and recognized the germ of evil , her own little brother , in there . It 's in all of us , of course . The question is , what do you do about it , my son ? This country has chosen to cultivate it for hundreds of years . Fleurs du mal . Amusing little plants that kill on contact . I have come too close already . I kneel till my knees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I am truly sick and frightened . These people whom I despised so recently have begun to terrify me . They find my innocence amusing . They consider me a pompous child in the ways of the heart . They laugh at my every move  --  lumberjack , Harvard man  --  it 's all the same joke . The solemn American hick , with his Bible and his four-square penis , waiting for Miss Right . " I hope you do n't think this is wrong "  --  that 's the endearment I had whispered in the punt . Now I remember . God is my strength , but oh how I hate to be laughed at . No religion can compete with my fear of that . I am already half leering at Chatworth with Millicent 's leer . My virtue seems as clownish as it had at St. Boniface . Am I going to go through life playing this scene , a randy little parson blunderinginto boudoirs and whorehouses while the crowd roars ? What 's happened to my famous equilibrium , my Christ-like understanding of sinners ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they pull a new one on me and knock me onp146my padded behind . Only when I have seen them all will I be beyond shock . That 's me , now , talking into this tape . I silently scream a last wild prayer for guidance , knowing that it 's typically American to pray for guidance . " You 're doing great , kid , " sing the Heavenly Host . " Your mom would be proud of you , " avers St. Joseph . The rancid kidding of the last few weeks has settled deep in my soul . I have graduated and am one of them . If I want to be . Goddamn their blasphemy . They 're not that good . Chatworthcatapults out of the Brompton Oratory as from a locker room . Go get ' em , tiger . Warn Priscilla . Then change that life . Sisboombah . " I do n't want to see those people again , " he tells her in the inevitable kitchen . It is a sunny deflating scene . Priscilla has suggested I help with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " That 's dreary of you , " she says . " Why do n't you want to see them ? " " They 're awful , that 's all . " " This is rather sudden is n't it ? You liked them all right yesterday . " " Did I ? I do n't remember ever liking them . It never came up . " Do n't be clever , Pen . Something has happened , has n't it ? " There 's a nerve-racking , limey tenderness in that last sentence ; Priscilla is on their side . " Not especially , " I say briskly . " Something with Millicent . " " No . " I am unprepared . This is some great warning I 'm giving Prissy  --  like a dwarf waving his arms through a frosty window . " They 're just awful , " I grope . " They do n't take anything seriously . " " How perfectly dreadful of them . "  | " You know what I mean . " " You mean you ca n't keep up with their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frightfully deep to make up for it . Is that it ? " I am furious , but I still can not tell her the facts . Some ghastly American reticence binds me . " They 're decadent , " I try again . " Whatever that means , " says Prissy , angry now herself . " Well , I 'm going to go on seeing them . We can always find a fourth . " " No ! You wo n't ! " She stares at me . What look of crazy ardor does she see ? My hand is on her arm , though we are not a touching family . " Do n't talk like that to me , " she says shakily . " Ever . " " They 're bad people . " I am helpless . " Pendrid . Something has happened . " " No . " " I 'm going to ask Millie . " " No . Please no . " Triumph . " All right . Then tell me yourself . " I am so anxious not to hurt her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point . " Milly is fond of you , " I wind up tamely . " So what ? " " And Gus is fond of her . " " Well , that 's very natural . " Am I doomed forever to relive my mistakes ? I am twelve and I have just launched my thunderbolt at Father Herman . It has fizzled . Very well . I will try harder . Shazam . I am a killer . I bow my head and tell Prissy the worst . It sets out to be a lurid account of upper-class vice , worthy of Father Donohue on his way to Sunday golf . In fact , as I pick up the round phrases of my old pastor , I realize how little it all amounts to . Like the terrible tale of Ponzo 's penis , it has lost something somewhere . All I see is a small boy ranting . I look at Priscilla . She is shaken  --  but by what ? Who is sick around here ?  |p148Is  she going to humor me ? " I think they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real panic . " I do n't ever want to see them again . " It is Priscilla 's trademark to run from the room at such moments . As she does so , it is my turn for sickly triumph . Later models of the Prig will be more and more sophisticated , until we arrive at the International Good Guy that you all know and like . " One of the few genuinely nice people in show business "  --  and why not ? Nobody ever studied harder , or tried on so many styles . The next few weeks can be filed under comic melodrama . I call this my Lord Gladstone phase , and it is best pictured in gaslight with me in a stovepipe hat . A Grand Master of niceness must sample everything , so I have a go at low life , starting with the whores in Shepherd 's Market and working my way to Soho . I told myself I was looking for unclassed persons like myself , who stood as far outside this fetid society as the waifs at Jenkins 's did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to overrate whores . But what else was there ? My own family could only churn up more and more Millies for me ; that 's how it is at the top of the tree . The fruit gets thin . If I wanted to meet the rest of England , I 'd have to do it myself , starting with this riffraff who never talked about Balliol and whose vice was strictly cash on the barrel . What I also wanted of course was to drown my adolescent hots in a spiritually acceptable way , and so I rushed about town with my halo on fire . And these girls were infinitely accessible , almost as if they were waiting for the right sociologistto come along . There was something especially cozy about the market , with the girls chatting in pairs from early afternoon on , or passing the time of day with old customers , or just moving about like cats , with no particular purpose  --  d guess some sort of movement was required by law , but itp149did n't matter what . For the lower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a tea shop where the door goes " ping . " At first I just watched , the way one watches pets , trying to guess what 's on their minds : why they stop at this window and not that , and where those little bursts of apparent decisioncome from . But it was n't that cozy . Several policemen indicated that I was supposed to keep moving too , that Englishlaw required an endless shuffle from everyone . I also gathered that the girls did not really like being stared at . Quite understandable . I was not going to make a social gaffe with this crowd , my last resort . " You like to come upstairs , cheri ? " Ho ho . I saw the joke of the " cheri " now . French my blooming arse . A rickety cockney with pancake make-up . Bless you , my dear . " No . I 'd just like to talk to you , " I say . And seeing her blank look , I hand her a ten-shilling note . " What are you doo-in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , take this back , you bloody twit . " She stuffs the note in my hand . Girls up and down the market glare or look away . Chatworth has done it again . England , you 've beaten me , you sod . There is no corner of you so low and mindless that there are n't mistakes to be made . I flee the alley and the girls behind me giggle like debutantes . Cr so I imagine , as I wait for my bus to Kensingtonand the blank looks of my parents . I am unequipped for life at any level . Worse than unequipped  --  my whole psyche is skewed wrong . You might as well pray , you holy fool . Perhaps my drift from the higher spirituality began that night . I lay drenched in grief and unworthiness , yet I had nothing to confess . Clumsiness is no sin  --  in fact , it is rather encouraged as a token of good faith . I know in my heart that a truly successful fornication would not have left me half so repentant . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just worthless . It 's all so rotten . " Sly old Chatworth , escapingp150into vagueness . I am going to win one soon around here or bust , sin or no sin . I gave up the market and decided to work Piccadilly , which seemed less clannish , more impromptu . The market was like a club , and all those strays were its members . Nobodynew had appeared there in years . Now I was heading for the wide open spaces on the no. 9 bus . Jiggling , for a brief moment pleased with himself , marvelous resilience . Chatworthis a wonderful character . I need this feeling if I am to accomplish anything . I feel like a veteran tonight . I understand these exchanges are supposed to be smooth as silk . " Not tonight , love . No hard feelings , " I croon . I glide by on gabardine wings , the King of the Spivs. " ' ow much ? " I say suavely . " Werl  --  ' ats a bit steep . I 'll give you a quid . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll take it , " she says . " Well , I do n't know , a bit tired actually , " I mutter . She grins maliciously . Well , not to worry . " Enjoying the night air , are we , sir ? " Oh Christ , a cop suaver than I.Still , I will not be shaken . I understand the machinery now . The bobbies sweep you off the street like a snowplow , and into the girls ' bed-sitters . It is not in anyone 's interest that you linger on the sidewalk , forming a consumer public . But they 're all really quite harmless , like my MGM figurines . I shall have to take potluck tonight and rely on my fast vision . The girls are master manipulators of lamplight and you have to get so close to examine them that you are halfcommitted . " Two pounds , love . " There is no flipping French spoken in this quarter , just statements as flat as a butcher 's . Unfortunately , I do not have two pounds , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problem , I can see . Besides , what do I want with them ? " Going out again , Pen ? " says Mother. up.  | " Where do you go when you go out ? " " The flicks , usually . " That would mean thirteen flicks in a row . " You must be quite an expert in the art of cinema , " says Priscilla , who has regressed for the moment to bullying flirtation : I have taken away her Marchbanks and left her with nothing . " Not to mention quite broke . " " Leave him alone , " says Father . We are all quite startled when he says anything apropos . Most of his remarks are general these days , on the state of the nation or the Church . E.g. , " Priest workmen indeed . As if you could get anyone in France to work , even the bishop of Paris . " More to himself than to us . But now the old clock has boomed and we are paralyzed . " Young men go out at night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he says . I sidle away . I hear his footsteps behind me . No , it is just some bank clerk on his way to a mass murder . But Father knows what I do at night . He understands . How bloody . It is raining , a condition I barely notice anymore , except that it gets the girls into their belted raincoats , which makes their outlines even more attractive , and complicates my work . I feel my father 's nudge . " Let 's take this one . " We 'll do it together . I 'll show you how I make that banging noise . I ca n't tell what 's rain and what 's sweat . Of course , there is no father , no nudge . And I had the nerve to call the Marchbanks decadent . My own incestuous little family has cooked up some poisons that would send them screaming . But we do n't name our poisons ; and we do n't even enjoy them . Reflections on a wet pavement . My parents never allowed themselves to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that had to be protected at all costs ; but now there is bad blood in the air , and anything that is said by the one is at least silently disapproved of by the other . A strange postwar indulgence . So on another night it might have been the other way round , with my mother bawling , " Let himp152alone . " And then she would have accompanied me on my walk , disapproving of this and that one , looking for a nice Irish girl , and following me up the stairs to say a rosary  --  oh God , forgive these thoughts . I 'm not myself . One outgrows the family , and one shrinks back into it . Priscilla spends her evenings at home now . Her next move will be , oddly enough , in the direction of the Communist party , but right now she has returned for shelter  --  only to find the shelter is down and my parents exhausted . Prissy is not as tough as she thought . These people over here are not playing . They are rougher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family . Tonight I will shake them off my back forever and mount the stairs alone . I pick a raincoat blindly . There are two quid squinched in my right hand and I lace my left one under the girl 's arm and march her to her place of business in lockstep . For what ? To talk ? Do n't be ridiculous . " Would you like to talk for a moment ? " I temporize . Perhaps I can convert her . " Talk ? I have n't got time for that , love . " Starts to undress . Am I out of control ? I am not even interested . Good lord . " I 'm paying you to talk , " I say . " Oh , you 're one of the kinky ones , are you ? I 'm sorry , I do n't do specialties . " " I 'd just like you to talk for as long as you 'd do the other . " " You would n't ' ave time to say Clement Atlee ' in that case , love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do the other ? " " Four minutes in and out . Check it with the coppers . They clock me . The original four-minute miler . " " Do n't you ever take a break ? " She looks old and tired even in the muted light of her off-pink bedroom . Her breasts sag and her stomach is covered with scars . How can she work this assembly line ? I want to help her , comfort her , bring a little light into her dark world and then perhaps screw her very gently . Show herp153there are decent people out there . That would n't be too sinful . " When I take a break , it 's not with kids like you , " she says . " Who 's it with , then ? " I mimic unintentionally . " Time 's almost up , dear . I 'll take the two quid , if you don'tmind , plus a little something for the maid . And I hope you'vehad a night to remember . " I hand over the money blankly . " There 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her hands on her mottled thighs and beckons roguishly . " I hate to short-change a customer , even a baby one . " I shake my head . " Just tell me something about yourself , how you got started ... " " That 's it , sonny . My conversation is more precious than gold itself . Mr. Woolworth could n't afford it . You 'll see your own way out , will you , sonny ? " A tough little people . As I slump down the stairs , she calls , " Next time pick on someone your own age . " I guess it is kindly meant . I return to the family . Here comes the London darkness now , plunging at us . I always seem to be coming in at night , so all my dreams of London are dark , with occasional thin strips of light . We worked in the dark at Jenkins 's to save electricity . Our flat was dark on principle . And the whores used the dark as prop : their chalk-white faces stayed buried in it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all was the confessional , which with my new life had become a tunnel of horrors , part of the London underworld . It was like suddenly coming to my senses in a strange place . The priest was no longer a toy for Chatworth to play with . He was a hanging judge , silent , nodding , processing my swill . I hate more than ever to make a fool of myself , yet for this man I do it on command . Why ? Because I want to make a fool of myself officially and know/ingly and receive grace for it . I want my Millicents and my Fifis to say , " You are forgiven . Clown no more . " Embarrass yourself no more . I ca n't ask the girls to say it , but I can almost oblige the priest to say it for them . Afterwards I lurch through the streets like a blind beggar . Will nobody take me in ? The people behind those curtains there  --  do you want me ? I go to pubs and listen , over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the serpentine simplicitiesof the London mind . Surely I could cut a figure here ? No . I 've tried it . They 'll tear you to pieces , boy . I 'm told that every adolescent goes through these silent months , but surely each must pass through a different country . We watch and wait ; we have been dispossessed . I began to feel bitter at my parents for jerking me from country to country until I belonged nowhere . I did n't realize that they were handing me my meal ticket , worth $200,000 per and up . It was a bloody apprenticeship , but I was learning points of manners and sensibility like a botanist . I now know exactly what it takes to make an Englishman angry ; I know how to make a forthright statement in American with no risk whatever , and how to skirt bad taste in two languages ; I know how to make you like or dislike me at will  --  even ( and this is like a ventriloquist drinking a glass of water while he works ) when I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me for using this knowledge . To get myself off the streets , I join a jazz club and meet a girl called Emma , and find that I can do no wrong . Life is insanely simple after all . My encyclopedia of mistakes runneth over , and I can make no more . Besides , she is point 2 down from me on the social scale  --  not far enough down to cause trouble . We maneuver a meeting in her room , and wear each other out petting in the usual style of the prerevolution . Step one goes smoothly , steps two , and three , and I realize she has no brakes at all . I am like a doctor with anp155etherized patient . I must make my own difficulties if I want any . Suddenly the box looms up like the Flying Dutchman . I imagine the mildest of priests going ape , losing his biretta , lunging at me , as I confess copulation . " I 'm a Catholic , " I tell Emma solemnly . " I 'm High Church . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we stood theologically . She got up and made some tea and we never addressed the subject directly . My thinking had  --  how to put it for a family audience ?  --  deflated me : it really was like the air going out of a tire . Curious . I learned later that very evening that it would have been better to say , " We just did it , Father , " than all the things I felt I had to say instead , about how far and how long and other feverish trivia . The priest did n't ask me for any of this : in fact , he seemed to be bored to distraction . English confessors just ca n't seem to bring their game up for impurity the way Americans can . He muttered something about considering the girl 's feelings and that was that . I hate to bore people , and I wanted to stay and impress him with my real sin , which was nothing less than confession itself . I had gotten sex and penance so hopelessly intermingledthat I could n't think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd been walking around and around sex and talking to it and being saintly in its presence , I 'd been imagining how I would explain it later  --  how phrase this act , how abase myself for that  --  until I 'd become the kind of saint who ca n't exist without his whorehouse . And London is still my whorehouse . This prim ruin that I had taken for sexless fairly reeks of it by now . In my dreams I still wander the mews and markets , smelling sex ; the shapes are lovely , but the smell as I get closer is cheap and used and mixed with sperm and garlic . ( Can you dream smells , or is it just the idea of a smell ? ) Anyway , I am overwhelminglyp156drawn to it , until the dream of confession sends me reeling away  --  to the next mews and the next . It is a sin I do n't have to confess ; I am half mad because I ca n't confess it . As I land now in spanking new Heathrow and wait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , that London comes back to me in all its dank triumph , and I look for that magic box where I can confess it out of my system once and for all . Well , all this is rather a lot to lay on a bored Oratorian Father , and I say nothing . He asks me to pray for him . Fat lot of good that will do . I do n't know what would have happened with Emma . I ca n't imagine not just going straight ahead with her . But then I ca n't really remember what stopped us at the bed 's edge in those days . There was something , all right , that blocked one like a pane of invisible glass , but what was it ? As soon ask someone what it felt like being hypnotized . Yet I treasured it , whatever it was , and even prayed for more of it . Anyway , I never found out about Emma because my fatherpulled a fast one on all of us . Winter was coming and it threatened to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ railway lines ice over , coal would n't move . The countryhad been miserable enough in the summer , the small promise of spring having turned to mud in the scrimy rain . People were sick of looking at each other , in their shapeless wartime clothes , yet they were forced to look at each other constantly , in one queue after another . Mother still reveled in it ghoulishly , because it made up for missing the war . But it was too much for Father . On the day that my matriculation results arrived ( flying colors , ho hum ) he suddenly announced , " I want to go back to America . " We barely heard it , taking it for one of his remarks-at-large . " And I mean to go back to America . " " What ? You ? America ? " " Yes , me , America . " " But you hate America . "  | " Do I ? Is that the impression I give ? Odd . " He shook his head . " Perhaps I did at one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has marvelous vitality . " He said this in such a tired voice that I all but laughed . Having criticized every custom and institutionon the American continent he was down to their damn vitality . Next it would be their " marvelous sort of innocence . " " Anyway , I do n't like what 's become of this place , and I do n't think it 's been good for the children . " Oh my God , he knows everything . He has stripped me with one flick of the tongue . I wrench my mind over to Priscilla : what is bad about her ? She has joined a local communistclub where the moral tone is dizzying . Prissy has distanced herself hysterically from the Marchbanks , and her new friends neither drink nor dance nor make jokes . Humor is considered a bourgeois trick ( I agree with this ) and incest is quite out of the question . It is all like joining a convent . " I did n't mind the friends you had before , the whatshisnames , Metcalfs ? Marchbanks . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the better sort of people  --  but at least they were the better sort of people . " " David ! " quoth my mother . " Oh come off it , dear . We would all dearly like to extend this class indefinitely if we could , but it has n't been extended yet . If anything , it 's shrinking . And in the meantime , there 's no point in sentimentalizing these others , " he paused and drew breath , " out of some misguided sense of one 's own social inferiority . " This was the cruelest dig at old O'Grady yet , a sign that England might be bad for him , too . " Are you trying to raise a pair of snobs ? " Mother fairly shouted . " No , only one lady and one gentleman . " " And you think America 's the place for it ? " " Yes , oddly enough , I do . " My mind was at war but I was too smug to know it . My mother was absolutely right , morally  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I knew ( having seen it all ) that they could be tough and resourceful . Yet the suggestion of my own innate superiority was hard to dismiss out of hand . The result was a kind of vague excitement over the whole argument wherever-it went . " I apologize to both of you for bringing you back , " my father said gravely . I looked at Priscilla in my goofy joy and realized that she was crying . She had never argued with my father ; in fact , for this last bad year , she had been the only real friend he had , laughing at his jokes whenever she decently could and clearly and simply loving him . Now she could n't even frame an argument . " I 'm not going , Daddy , " she blurted at last . " Yes you are , " he said quietly . She shook her head . " I 'll live with Ron . " " Ron ? What Ron ? " " At the club . Ron Adams . I love him . " " Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Oh yes we can . " There was iron in my father and he was happy to be using it again . " Priscilla , I 'll be heartbroken if you do this , but it wo n't alter my plans . You are a grownup , free to make your own decisions , but so am I. Now tell me about this Ron if you please ? " " He is n't a gentleman , if that 's what you mean . " Well , that was that . We sat in silent gloom . " I 'd like to meet him before you move in with him , " said my father finally , " gentleman or no . " Priscilla left the room . Would she have the guts to bring a communist boyfriend around here ? " You and your sort of people make me bloody sick . " " Yes , I suppose we must . " Father would be magisterial : he has lost an empire but found a role . The family would splinter , but about time perhaps . The question was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here ? She spent the afternoon in her room , and skipped supper.  |p159Afterwards  , as I sat on my bed thinking deep thoughts of me , she tapped on the door . " Pen ? Are you there ? " " Speaking . " She was wearing flowered pajamas , in what seemed like a conscious effort to be childish . " What should I do , Pen ? " " Well , that 's up to you , is n't it ? " snapped the apostle of toughness . " Daddy does n't want me , does he ? He told me to go to blazes . " " I would n't say that . He told you to be an adult and make your own decision . " " Oh , be an adult . Fly to the moon . Just like that . " She paused . " You know why he 's doing it , do n't you ? For you . I can do as I choose . You 're the prize . " Vanity swells like a blowfish . " I do n't believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Pen . You 're too intelligent not to have noticed it . He adores you . He only tolerates me . Why do you think he 's been so hangdog since we got back ? He feels as if he 's let you down . This country is n't good enough for you . So he 's even willing to go back to America and face the beastly hot dogs for your sake . " " I never said I wanted to go back . " " Oh , Pen , it 's perfectly obvious . Every time he says somethingnasty about England you chime in like gangbusters . And the way you go sulking off at night , and do n't have any friends , and do n't talk to anybody  --  of course he 's worried sick about you . " " Nothing to worry about , " I mumble . " Anyway he does n't want me , that 's quite clear . Nobody 's ever wanted me . " She looked so sad picking at her slipper that I felt I should say something bracing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . I personally did n't give a damn if anybodyp160wanted me at that particular moment . My object now was to put some starch into this girl . " We 're all fond of you , you know . Very fond . " Ah , the ardors of the Chatworths , the Latin excesses . " Do you want me to go with you to America ? " asked Priscilla . Me ? What difference did that make ? " What about this chap that loves you ? Adams ? " " I did n't say he loved me . I said I loved him . " This was getting a little sticky for my taste . " He 's too good a party member to need anybody . Oh God , " she put her head in her hands , " why does n't anyone just love me ? " Too much . " Do n't you think you 're being just a bit self-pitying ? " She looks up . " Yes , I daresay I am . How wise you are , Pen . " Gets up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is pierced . I do love her , but this is a Marchbanks-likesickness , and must be fought . Our family can not go on clinging to each other forever . The war is over . I have had the guts to fight free . Prissy must do the same . I am torn with an urge to run out and put my arms around her and sink my head in her hair and cry with her until dawn . I want to say , " I just love you , " but I do n't do it . I DO N'T DO IT . Waiter , fetch me the Pope . I think we 've found serious matter this time.  |p161Being  a mythical beast , I have to keep both my front and back ends in good working order . My front is the eternal tourist , with that look of goofy wonder painted on his face ; my ass is the oldest settler , who 's seen it all . I may turn them around from time to time , but that 's who they are , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other . Preferably the damn tourist . Specifically , I wish I could phase out of one country or the other , but I 've a hunch if I lose one I 'll lose both  --  that 's how closely they watch each other . I know there 's a cabal of colonials at the BBC that ca n't stand English accents , but they can probably only put me over on the other team as a flourishing half-breed . I am nature 's compromise candidate . As for America  --  ah , these things go deeper there . Americansplay identity for keeps . They even keep reservations full of lapsed Englishmen in Hollywood and elsewhere as a warning : and late at night these miserable twilight characters are let out just as far as the nearest talk show , to remind Chatworthto keep on his toes . Mustaches drenched in tea . Ugh . So I have to keep going out and coming in again , like a castp162of three trying to play Ben-Hur , in order to seem like a fresh character . And miraculously it works . My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Outside World Looks at America , " has opened to thumping reviews even by the young hardnoses who tell it like it is . Even allowing that this great country ca n't resist an excuse to look at itself one more time in any light whatever , the show must be considered a genuine personal triumph . So I must guard against wallowing again . Look at these damn clippings for instance . It is so degradinglyeasy to be called civilized in America . What sort of pig farms were they raised on themselves ? And this , " It is such a pleasure to hear adult conversation "  --  why , in God 's name ? Who is keeping it from them ?  --  " and not to be talked down to . " That 's what you think , Cyclops . Mm , I love you all anyway , but I wo n't fall for you this time . The memory of Jersey is too real , and my civilized adultness has reasserted itself in time . Also , my compliments do n't travel . Nobody in England ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sparkle . Yeah , and my impishness . Get a load of that , Muldoon . If going out and coming in again is the name of the game , I really got down to it in 1947 . On my first two crossings I had been as innocent and reluctant as a tennis ball , but this time I 'm going where I want to go and with my eyes , so far as I can tell , open . Before returning to America that year , we dance a Chatworthfandango , with my will power playing softly on the tom-toms . Mother will stay with Priscilla and I will go with Father . Unthinkable ? On the whole , yes . Peace has not shatteredus that much . All right . Priscilla will marry her Ron in a Catholic Church , and Ron can keep his fingers crossed if he likes . No ? Ron says we 're a pack of bloody cynics ? May have a point there . Father will change his mind then ? No , no , no . Mother capitulates . Her show of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what is she ? Middle forties ? Unbelievable . Fa/ther is in his fifties , but he 's never seemed fitter . Now that his mind is made up , he 's lighthearted as a boy . A week passes , two . He will not break . So it turns out that Priscilla will come with us after all . It is not quite as weak a decision as it sounds . Ron Adams has insisted that she denounce her family . He wants a scene , and asks for an appointment . It is all too much . " It 's for the better , Prissy , " says Father . " You 'd have had to give up so much . Not just your clothes and books and comfort  --  at your age , one does n't mind those things , I daresay . And you 'd probably find a cold-water flat positively exhilarating , and several rather moist infants would be a wonderful challenge . But you 'd be giving up your life , in ways that you do n't even know about . You 'd be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a slave , " says Priscilla . " And it 's all not for the best . I just have n't the courage to go through with it . " Father shrugs . As long as she does the right thing , it does n't matter why . He is free now from the burden of her love . Priscilla will hate him till the day she dies , and beyond . All for the best . His nerves are too fragile for love . I talked to Priscilla about this years later and she assures me I 'm quite mad . " I ca n't even remember what Ron looked like . But I 'm sure it would have been a disaster . I did n't love him , you know . I was probably using him to get attention . And he certainly did n't love me : he just wanted to make a scene in an upper-class house . Anyway , I 'd mind very much a cold-water flat by now . " Priscilla will tease me till the day I die . I do n't know if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I never shall . Even on the great Daddy Question . She has a large picture of the old man on her bedside table , but never talks about him . She is cool , witty , and evasive like him , and her husband is a great fool , like Mother . Or perhaps he just does it for me . That year in New York was what I would later be calling a period of transition , if not a downright watershed , in myp164college essays . New York was as bright as London was dark , and I remember a jumble of clear blue days and gleaming snowbanks and dazzling white teeth which , on the smithy of my soul , became a pop star with a difference . The very first day , I asked a cop , " You got the time , Mac ? " and he said , " British , huh ? I was over in the war . " Chatworthhad no idea he 'd sunk this low in a year and a half . St. Boniface had slightly unbalanced him in one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even when they were praising our beautiful accents . So I wrote the cop off as an oddity and set to work on the real problem , bending my accent back again . Talk about your fateful decisions . " Cuppa cawfee , " I muttered to myself ; but in public I asked for a glass of milk . ( Phoneticists note : The broad a 's are a snap , but oh those short o 's . ) In the violence of his own anti-English recoil , Father enrolledme in a local Catholic college : by which accident my warped Anglophobia was sustained . The IRA was beginning to stir , and my new friends invited me to go downtown one night and picket Ernie Bevin , the British foreign minister . No Camus character was ever more existentially torn . Here I was playing the Irish game again as farce . My buddies and I had been drinking beer all afternoon and we set forth in the thoughtful spirit of a panty raid . I felt a little queasy picketingmy own foreign minister , but I probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dynamite , Gypo ? " I whisper , to keep things light . " No , I t'ought yous had the dynamite . " " Jaysus  --  ya know something , fellas ? We forgot the dyna-mite . " We are laughing so hard we collapse on a pile of overcoats . There 's no treason in that . The teen-age mystic of London became giddy and harebrainedin the spanking air of postwar New York . In 1947 , pollution was only a speck on the horizon , and life was ap165dance , even for my old man , who had entered a religious phase himself . He began catching early Masses and late Masses and going on retreats where they sang obscure liturgies . Was he really enjoying America ? If not , you could have fooled me . He bounded off to what he called his work at cockcrow , catching Masses as he went . In spare moments he talked to me gently but vaguely about my plans . " Any thought to the future , Pen ? " " Not really . " " Plenty of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's what I thought . " " Lord , it 's such a different world . In my day , an old man could still talk to a young one and tell him something of use , but now ... " You do n't have to , I wanted to tell him . I did n't wish to confine my greatness to a profession just yet . " The law ? " " Possibly . " " Perhaps you should start thinking about it . " " Perhaps . " Then suddenly , " I want you to be first-rate , Pen . Think you can manage that ? " " I 'll give it a try . " We smile . His duty done , he is off for Benediction with a spring in his step . He had never really been religious before , except in that jingoist way of counting Catholic heads and gloating , but now he 'd found it was the only thing left a chap could count on . What did he think about as he bent in prayer ? Old cricket matches ? Superb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what sort of work he bounced every day . He could n't still be spying , could he ? If so , on what ? For some reason , I could not accept his import-export business  --  partly because I never met any witnesses . He brought home no business friends , and his briefcase looked empty . All I know is he just dressed neatly , swooped downtown , and disappeared.  |p166By  now I realized that most English gentlemen of his generation appeared brain-damaged ; it meant nothing , they were simply covering for the others . But I could n't shake the notion that Father was basically unemployable , and I decided that we must be living on Mother 's money . That 's what it was . The Chatworths had seen her coming and had taken the simple colleen to the cleaners . Now they sneered at her . At any rate , there was something poisonous in the English air that had rusted their marriage and given it a harsh , peevish feel . I wondered if it had been like that before the war , too . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sensitive moment in 1931 , and Aunt Maude had snickered , and Father had reddened , and the cat had fainted , and things had never been the same . How small and quaint it seemed from this great bright city twinkling on its bed of rocks . At times now Father and Mother were almost like lovers again , touching each other by mistake : as if they 'd come here to save their marriage . Anyway , Mother 's little mutiny seemed to have folded completely . In exchange , she had become almost too dutiful a wife , and I was slightly disgusted at her lack of spunk . I mention this to show my fanatical attention to detail as a fuck-up . Astrologers tell me I 'm a perfectionist , so maybe that 's it . Priscilla had obtained a part-time job in a library and in the evenings went out listlessly with large , smooth men of the stockbroker persuasion . I got a feeling she was going to make a wretched but socially suitable marriage , out of spite . I see this now as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time she was being rather silly . Thank God the American Catholic aristocracy never quite came up with the right combination of horrors . My father did n't think any of them were socially suitable . I took only the remotest interest in all this myself . I was too busy singing the Whiffenpoof song in German beer cellarsand steeping myself in America . Muldoon is here , or at least his type , but how he 's changed in two years : quieter ,  |p167more  buttoned-down , raising hell in a rather ritualized way on Saturday nights : knocking off at twelve , hitting the books , going steady with Catholic girls who smile around the clock , but will not put out . At least not for Muldoon , who respects them for it . He 's OK with me . Americans are not really people , like the English , with their niggling particularity , but ideas , spaces . Muldoon is , for instance , what is appropriately called a square . This is because he is really a killer and has to watch himself . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abstraction . This still gives me an edge over most foreign observers , who think Americans are born that way . It also gives me a disadvantage , as I wait for the killer to pounce . Actually , American Catholics were rather a special subspecies back then , but they were all I knew . We all stopped drinking at twelve sharp on Saturday nights and we thought twice about saying " Jesus "  --  but did n't everybody ? We had no non-Catholics to judge by , so that going around with soot on your forehead and a blessed throat seemed perfectly normal . Perhaps our weirdest practice , though , was the avoidance of uncharitable remarks . Guys would fall silentor in extreme cases leave the room if you talked behind someone 's , anyone 's , back . Friend , foe , it made no difference : he was precious in the eyes of God , so he 'd better be good enough for you , buddy . Has any remote tribe ever practiced anything so inhuman ? Charity established a reserve among us as stern as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( which was perhaps the point ) ; but to make up for it , comradeshipabounded , since you could have an equally good time with any group  --  no more , no less . And the iron goodwilllater turned out to be perfect for game shows and sales pitches . A priest 's cold warmth remains the ideal for daytimeTV . The absence of friends also makes a dreamer of you , and my dream that year had consequences , because it was so astoundingly commonplace . And you ca n't be a public figurep168unless you 've had at least one branding , blinding , 100 percentcommonplace dream . It usually started out with a long shot of me , bouncing my shanks in a jalopy , riding along ratty highways through towns of throbbing vulgarity  --  " Ma 's Eats , " " The Pink Pussy , " " The Boom Boom Room "  --  and on into the void . One last Texaco pump manned by a Navajo , and then nothing . Land too bare to support cactus . Air so pure you can see a hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either me or somebody else , standing in the middle of the widest Main Street you ever saw . The sidewalks deserted , except for the weeds in the cracks . A theater marquee hanging by its rust , a general store with the windows shot out , a tavern , a barbershop . Time to be moving on . I or somebody else starts walking slowly toward the great American emptiness . The quaint English village can go stuff itself . You 'll spot my sources , of course , and can probably name the exact movies . MGM gave me Mrs. Miniver and Universaltook her away . Never mind . The films are only my pallet . I have to fill them with life or death myself . This man , me or somebody else , can change his name or his face at will . Mustaches come and go . At the same time he is a rock of integrity , of some sort . I am intoxicated by this vision . I can invent myself here , so long as I am first-rate . There is no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ volumes , which they wo n't let you see anyway ; there is no graveyard with my name already on it . The vultures will get me out there in the blue instead . The funny thing is that it 's all come true . Priscilla , who is bored with the question , told me the last time I saw her that I began to amuse people around then with jokes and imitations . This is so far from my own memory of the period that I scarcely believe it possible . Knowing that I 'd outgrown Muldoon by then , I ask her craftily , what was the nature of my comedy ? Making fun of the English , she says . Which English ? All the English . Everyone you ever metp169there . But most especially Gussie Marchbank . Your imitationof him was so cruel we began to think you were some sort of genius . I tell her she must have the dates wrong . I was trying to get rid of the English at that point and I could not afford to touch the accent , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " says Prissy , yawning . " You theater people she always calls me " theater people " in her wicked English way do have to worry so much about yourselves , do n't you ? Your images and so forth . " She 's becoming more and more like Father . " Thank God , " she goes on , " I have no such responsibilities to my image and am only too happy to forget the whole dreary business . " Do I look hurt ? There are wounds only an older sister can open . " I mean my part of it , " she adds quickly . " I do n't mind talking about you forever . " I reach stiffly for my hat  --  or whatever one does when one has n't got a hat . The horrible thought strikes that if I was making fun of the English then , I must have been doing it to please my new gang . Enough of this morbid crapping around . The thing to remember about my dream is the two themes , emptiness and vulgarity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Yet even this dream I have betrayed at times . Toward the end of the school year Father enters the hospital . He is dying . Is n't that just like him ? He did it like a gentleman . Multiple myeloma was the name of the inconvenience . He 'd been taking treatments for months and now the jig was up . He packed his own bag and off he went with Mother to a hospital overlooking the East River . Mother kept us informed , easing us into the shock as gently as she could . Death was messy , and he clearly preferred to do it alone . So I did n't see much more of him . When I did , he chatted amiably about this and that and I began to wonder if he knew . " Oh yes , he knows , " said Mother . " For how long ? "  | " I do n't know . Longer than I have . " She fell silent , and I sensed she wanted him for herself . Unfair , of course . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children . It leaves a nasty taste . God , how they tried to protect us . Very un-Catholic of them , I think now . Good Catholics want you to look at Death early and often , so you get used to it . But for once , manners won out over religion . For my part , I think I at least half wanted to talk to him about it , to ask how he 'd discovered it and what it felt like . Conversation might take the curse off it . But his sense of privacy was fierce and cunning . He would not tell me , he would show me , how to die . His calmness began to terrify and infuriate me . I could n't die like that in a million years . Crack , damn you . Weep . Do n't go on about the promising crop of players at Wimbledon . Did he cry when we left the room ? I hope so . I can not stand his damn superiority . I sense that he limits our visits because he can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strain even for him . He is doing this for me . He is destroying me . " Do be first-rate , wo n't you Pen ? " My last visit with the old soldier , I know it for sure . He has shrunk to nothing . It is grotesque to go on talking about Wimbledon . Ca n't we talk turkey just once ? He looks at me humorously . Decidedly not . Turkey , forsooth . I feel cheated even now . Why did n't I force him to talk ? Would n't it have been a relief for both of us ? I could n't , that 's all . I did n't even cry or show my sorrow , but left on a jaunty note . I had bought his style without his content  --  something else for my bag of tricks . Never teach someone to hide his feelings until you 've made sure he has any . But it was all so quick and deft , I had no time to feel . He was suddenly gone , like a conjurer 's handkerchief . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or so later , and took this for grief . I hope to God it was . The three of us clung together giddily  --  the Chatworths abroad and alone again . Priscilla had seemed , I recall , unconcerned duringp171those last weeks , but now she devoted herself to consoling Mother , who was in a genuine flash flood of grief . I had never realized how much I personally had depended on the old man 's presence . It had nothing to do with liking him : I just needed him in order to perform . Without him I was nobody , a lost child . For a short while I even gave up my dream of the harsh empty plains and longed to huddle round an English fireplace in my jammies . Mummy and Prissy seemed to be excluding me now . They were always together , murmuring , murmuring . It was n't fair . He was mine as much as theirs . Actually , Mother was more than willing to talk to anyone after the first day or so . She was a gregarious mourner , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on her , and such friends as we had received an earful . " Your father was a remarkable man " ; her grief became , and remains , rather formal and ceremonial , as if she were unveiling a plaque . " The doctors tell me he might have had warnings before we left for England two years ago . He only told me after he decided to return to the States last spring . It was his way of persuading me to come . " A flicker . Does she feel guilty about treating him so thoughtlessly in England ? No . She is too tough and sane for that . If he did n't tell her he was dying it is no fault of hers . That sort of sniveling guilt is for the heartless and the sentimental , i.e. , for me . It leads , when its time is up , to resentment . Father made us act unfeelingly by not telling us . And he left us this legacy of doubt about how long he knew : did we treat him callously for six months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was simply the impossible , malicious example he set of virtue and love which ended my dreams of saintliness for keeps . My own grief has hardened into a differentshape from Mother 's . How dare anyone outlove me so ? What unbeatable moral advantage has he taken into eternity ? Meanwhile , there were practical problems which Mother and I proved laughably unendowed to meet . By default Priscillabecame the man of the family . She took care of thep172funeral arrangements , which I vaguely supposed somebody else did for you . ( Father had said any piece of Catholic ground would do , so Prissy vengefully took him at his word , and he rests today in Yonkers . " Goodness what a name ! ! " ) She also dove into his finances and helped Mother make some sense of them . His business turned out to be quite real , and she told me he 'd left us a good bit in trusts and insurance , damn him . Finally , Priscilla rehabilitated Mother , making her at least appear to be a functioning human being . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complete . She is widely considered a remarkable human being . ) Then Prissy announced she was returning to England . Mother regressed on the spot . " Then we 'll all go , " she said brightly . " What about me ? " I piped . " Yes , what about Pen ? " said Mother . " I give up . What about Pen ? " said the masterful Priscilla . " Suppose I do n't want to go ? " " Then you can stay . " " Oh Priscilla , " Mother whinnied . " He ca n't stay by him-self . " " Well , why do n't you stay with him ? " Priscilla looked desperate . " Look , I am leaving . For once , I 'm doing what I want . The rest of you can suit yourselves . " But the sight of Mother coming unstuck again was almost too much for her ; and the thought of not doing something unselfish must have burned . " I 'm not leaving , " I said helpfully . Mother sobbed . Prissy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " For a change , I ran from the room . Mother had always depended on someone else . Even her little burst of independence in England was under Daddy 's shield ; it was a kind of Irish play-acting . Or am I wrong about this ? Was it her shield all along ? Either way she is lost without him . We all are . Suddenly we are sickened by our need for eachp173other . Being alone against the world is bad for one 's health . Priscilla is now twenty-one and I am eighteen and we ca n't break away . Loathing is not far away . " I gave in last time , " said Priscilla , when we were alone . " It 's your turn . " " Yes , but you see , I hate England . " " Well , I hate America with all my heart . " " You do ? " " Yes , and I have from the day we landed in 1940 , if you must know . Now as a British citizen I would like to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not going back to that perfumed shithouse . " " Pen ! What colorful argot you 've picked up . Look  --  why do n't you just stay here by yourself and I 'll go back with Mummy . " I should have , of course , but then there would be no Monty Chatworth today , and we 'd all be the losers . As it was , I said that Mummy could never agree to that , and Prissy said that she could n't desert Mummy , and we generally punched Mummy about until she was shapeless . I wound up accepting a compromise . If Uncle Henry could wangle me into his old college at Oxford , I would go back just for the duration of that . " There are lots of super Americans over there and you can practice your idioms all day long , " said Prissy . " I 'll even buy you a subscription to the Readers ' Digest . " I did n't want to go to the damn place . It was just a facesavingdevice . Father 's death had temporarily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ owned of this world . I could always rent a country and an accent , but all I owned for sure was a mother and a sister and a funny name . I would hang onto those a bit longer . Uncle Henry set up an interview for me with the fellows of Paisley College ( yeah , hey nonnie nonnie ) and I meekly agreed to cooperate . I had a church , too , of course , but that did n't seem quite as firm without Father 's smugness to support it . In fact , though he was as ignorant as a peasant about it and even ap174bit bored , it was Father 's church , and was one of the things he took with him . After that Mother 's devotion just seemed childish and wishful , and Prissy gave up believing altogether . For myself , I realized that I was not an American-Catholic and I was not an English-Catholic , and there is no such thing as just a plain Catholic . The English kind were too corrupt for my taste and the Americans were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ churches : it lacks the gamy smell of England , the delicate sense of rot . Once you have sampled Rome as perversion , it 's hard to go back to **27;5728;TOOLONG . Only in the box where the priest mumblesinaudibly in the dark do I still get the tang of it . Did I tell you the Marchbanks were Catholics ? It occurred to me as I flew back toward Oxford that Englandhad indeed planted a small germ of corruption in me . There was a physical eagerness to get back that made my heart pound . For what ? I determine to stay as American as I can , and to meet nothing but Americans in Oxford . They might be dull but they are clean . And a homeless man can not take chances . Left to his own devices , Chatworth might just turn into a dribbling , giggling peer , slugging the altar wine and screaming blasphemies in Latin . And we do n't want that to happen , do we of buddy ?  |p175Why  ca n't I go to Africa the way I used to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Third World was my kind of place , though , while it lasted . In a rumpled white suit you could be anyone  --  a German explorer , an Italian adventurer , a burnt-out schoolboy . Talk about your melting pot . Then they put in skyscrapersand air conditioning and they grew their own announcers , little black Chatworths who looked and sounded just like me . From Nairobi to Kenyatta , I 'd meet these smooth customers  --  only in gray suits now  --  on the lam from Johannesburg , Cairo , and the Sorbonne . Who needed me any more ? My rumpled suit looked like a Victorianclown 's outfit in the emerging nations . I 'd gotten a jump on the postwar world , but that was all . Little did I know that even then Chatworth factories were being planned in the jungles and fever swamps . All you need is 165 pounds of bullshit and you can build one anywhere . So keep moving , Transatlanticus . This is your pilot Virgil speaking . You 're lucky they did n't make you a newsreader.  |p176You  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way a model likes a sand dune or a snowman or whatever she looks good in front of . Africa was a great showcase for your style , and now you 're sore at it . Because one of the killing things about our homeless person here is that deep down , he hates foreigners . Paisley College , Oxford , is the lowest of the low , let 's say twenty-fifth out of a possible twenty-six . It is not Uncle Henry 's college or Father 's or anyone 's , but the biggies are out of reach for an old St. Boniface man and the Master of Paisley is an old Catholic pal of Uncle Henry 's . So through heaven knows what chicanery , I am accepted there . I can tell the fix is in from the boozy unbuttoned tone of the interview , with the sherry fairly flying . And three more weeks at Jenkinsare more than enough to shoot me through the entrance exam in history . Uncle Henry is nice about it , as he would be to any obvious retardate . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tulkinghornwent there and the poet Simpkins , and various others . " It is clear that he would see his own son work in a whorehousebefore he sent him to Paisley . Never mind . There is something to be said for these thirdrateinstitutions of mine . Paisley College would be a ludicrousplace to get an education , but it was superb for launching a career . Unlike some of the other bad-breath colleges , Paisley did not strive to impress . It had been around for a long time , and it had the pride of a small tradesman with roots . It did n't need scholars and it did n't need athletes  --  though the Master was hung up on lacrosse , so the place teemed with lacrosse players , and we were widely respected in the lacrosse community . Paisley would be here after we were gone , and nothing we did could add much to that . After one of my recent English triumphs I ran across a note in the alumni magazine asking for the whereabouts of P. A. Chatworthand it almost made my cry.  |p177It  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just long enough , that every Oxonian starts out belonging to every club in the place that will have him . Shivering in one 's rooms , one is flattered to be solicited in turn by the salty tough from the Labour Club , the twenty-guinea blazer from the Tories , the hot-eyed fascist , the flat-earther : they all want me . How have they heard of me ? Never mind . Two and six is a small price to pay this godlike fellow here . Only later does one recognize the great shakedown for what it is . The cards on the mantelpiece are sucker 's trophies , a register of how much you yearned for acceptance that first week . Knowing hands destroy them before too many people get wind . By the second time round , the sleazy little con man from Labour , the flatulenthanger-on from the Tories are clearer to you . By the end you belong to nothing . Not I , however . Everyone else leaves with a small precious relic of Oxford , a few friends and memories that make your eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to back up for my memories ; I wanted everything , like a good American . Which means I got nothing , right ? Wrong . None of your two-bit French wisdom around here , please . At that age you can do it all . You can drink and drop your pants with the rugger players , and you can burn incense ( and drop your pants , with feeling ) with the aesthetes ; you can demonstrate with the reds , and sit behind the curtained windows of the Wolfenden deploring the hooliganism . You can even have principles  --  any number of principles . On Sundays I wallowedin the rich fruitiness of the Church ; on weekdays I dismembered it for the synthetic a priori proposition that it was . What a fate for the whore of Rome , to be shrunk like a Papuan skull by scrawny Oxford logicians . Everybody else was so preposterously sincere that I assumedit was a gag , and that they were all having as much fun as I. The Socialists were so madly socialist , tearing at lank strands of hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gentlemen , wheezing through preternaturally aged nostrils  --  surely they had had operations ? How was I to know that they meant every word of it ? That the secret of English acting is that they are not acting at all ? Even the phonies are absolutely real . But I did n't know this then , and I jumped in merrily , playing this part and that in the Oxford game , never guessing that I played alone . I began as Chatworth the American . This can be further divided into the rich American , and the all-purpose American . By juggling the two , I could get into anything  --  even into intellectual circles , where I was treated like a Central African with bananas on his head . Everything I said was greeted with enormous respect : it talks ! Since I knew the English tricks backwards , I became at once the Brilliant American  --  although all I was was an average Englishman . I 'm sorry . I could n't resist it . At night , if I was sober , I reviewed my basic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Catholic ; that was the word written on my heart . Then I am an American convert  --  so sure of myself that I could afford to fool around . Politically I am  --  what ? A gap here . My father had once run for Parliament as a Tory , but this did n't mean he was remotely interested in politics . On my American side , I could n't see Bogart or Cooper sitting on committees of either persuasion . I am free to create myself , my besetting sin . I have no interests , no allegiances . I shall play the field while I 'm still young , before settling down with some nice older ideology . Meanwhile , what am I bid for the clever American ? I feel my father 's lazy smile forming on my lips . Because I am a Catholic I can afford to be playful about worldly matters . Of course , I have since learned that Daddy worked himself into a collapse over that parliamentary candidacyin 1936  --  he took everything so damn hard  --  but right then I thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ultimate dandy twist . The light fades and the tapp179drips . I am a Catholic , I am a Catholic . I am a man saying he is a Catholic . Tuesday night . The Socialists . A huff of duffel coats . The mood is truculent and they jostle you on the way in , although there are only twelve of them . We are rough , we are authentic . Superb . There will be no false politeness around here , only love . We will hold your dying head in our arms , but that 's all we 'll do for you . You 'll have to fight for your cup of tea same as the rest of us . Everyone present has a working-class accent except for me . I can do one , but it would seem to carry the joke too far . I do n't know what will come out if I try to speak . The talk turns to America , and turns ugly . I am the oppressor , it seems . My inherent contradictions will undo me eventually , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ markets . And what do I make of that ? I put up my hand . " Let 's hear it from the Yank . " Coarse working-class laughter from the young gentlemen . " Let him speak , for Godsake . " " Thank you , brother , " say I  --  " comrade " seems a bit much . " I guess I 'd like to inquire right off which Americans the brothers are referrin ' to ? As a guy who 's woiked the " woiked " just slipped out , I swear it since I was twelve myself , I 'm not sure who I been oppressin ' all this time . Could somebody straighten me out on that ? " Silence from the ninnies , as middle-class values reassert themselves . They have hurt my feelings ! How puce-making . As one who has gone up to Balliol from the Klondike , I hasten to bury these cupcakes . " And my old man woikin ' at the Navy Yard durin ' de Depreshun  --  I am trapped with the accent and I ca n't even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the house ?  --  was he oppressin ' people all that time ? I 'd really like to know . "  | " Unwittingly . " A strangled mumble . " It sure as hell was unwittin , ' " I thunder . My problem was not to sound too illiterate to be at Oxford in the foist place . I slyly drop the " dese " and " doze " : what do they know ? " We sure did n't wit it at home , over the caviar and truffles , and we did n't wit it as we piled into the Cadillac for our Sunday outin 's . Jolly dense of us , I suppose . " An imitation imitating an imitation  --  Ah , Chatworth , you 're killin " em . In their desolation over the breach of manners they had lost their intellectual bearings , and you would actually suppose I was scoring points . I should have left it at that , I suppose , before I was found out for sure . But you know how it is with these things . Merlin probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lessons of a lifetime came together and they worked . So now I just wanted to see if I could unembarrass them : " Just remember when you guys talk about American oppressors that there 's millions like me , who 're just as oppressed as you are , and who boin for justice like you do . Tank youse . " Sits down testily . The chairman does his best , like a ruffled dowager calming a drunken genius . " I think we 'd all like to apologize for any misunderstanding and possible impoliteness . Shall it so be passed ? " " Aye , aye , " gruff working-class sounds again . " And to thank our transatlantic cousin for reminding us that there are indeed two Americas . " Spattering of applause . It is just a game , is n't it ? Can I come out now ? " We do n't get too many of your sort here , " says a surly Yorkshireman of a kind who does n't like to apologize and will make me pay if he can . Damn right you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell them I was only speaking for all the Brooklyn boys they will never get to meet at Oxford , but decide against . The Yorkshiremanconveys a physical menace rare in Englishmen , and touches an old nerve of prudence ; he is a barbarian from thep181North , a type I learn to respect on the spot . ( Of course . He does n't get the point up here : he is not acting . ) But something more than that stills my tongue . There is a sense of awe among the others , as they circle a live American . I know what they mean ; I have felt it myself . To be near one is to be near a great center of power , like a dam or a blast furnace . Even these Yank-baiters feel it , against their wishes ( except the Yorkshireman . ) This is 1948 ; it will never happen again . I , surrogate , imposter , am standing in for the American powerhouse . So I go on with my Brooklyn imitation , which is based on the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do just as well . Wednesday . Dinner at the Wolfenden with my new friend Tufnell . He is a great fool , but cunning . He is not impressed by Americans  --  quite the reverse . He considers them an utter calamity . Hear him first at the Oxford Union bar : " Worse than the Visigoths , worse than the Tartars . They would only have raped our women , not our language as well . " " Poor bastards , " says a cheeky American down the bar . " Eh ? What 's that ? " " I mean your language is pretty good . " Laughter . Tufnell bridles . " It was pretty good until you people got hold of it and updated it vocabulary-wise into a rooting tooting balls-up . You do n't care what words mean , as long as they have five syllables and sound important . " " Well , what can you expect from huddled masses ? " says Chatworth ( for it is I ) . " We should never have let the bastardsland , in my opinion . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bloke , " what exactly do you masters of language mean when you say awfully decent ' and frightfullynice ' ? And what precisely is the sense of terribly ' in the phrase terribly good of you ' ? I 'm here to learn , sir . " The crowd at the bar is having a jolly time . This being the Oxford Union , I suspect they 're all South Africans . Tufnellp182is not as dumb as he looks . " I daresay you may have a point , Mac . What are you drinking ? " So I become his American and he takes me to dinner at his club and tells me all about it . " It 's so rare to meet a gentleman from across the , pond . " " And it 's so vulgar to call it the pond . " He is delighted , as I knew he would be . I remember this man from a previous existence . He is fleshy and good-looking and he assumes comfortably that I take him for upper class . But that face and voice belong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why , for all his nonsense , he needs an American . I enjoy knowing that my class is actually better than his . " I suppose you went to Yale , or some such ? " " Er  --  yes , Yale , that 's it . " " Then you must know Tony Hotchkiss . Marvelous value , Tony . " Ohmygod , he 's got two Americans . Chatworth , you 're getting smug . " Well , I was sick a good deal of the time there . " One question about Yale would strip me clean . " Also , I went sailing with Dad a lot . The Bahamas and so forth . What with that and the polo ... " I was laying it on wildly now , so that it would seem like a good joke when he caught on . But the silly bugger believed it all . So zany was their picture of America that one could tell them anything . Oh God , what a temptation for an innocentboy . The talk drifts on over the suspect pate and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meal . Quite . For a crazy moment I miss my father , quite overwhelmingly . Yonkers ! It passes . " I must say I envy you Americans in one respect . At least you have n't been taxed senseless by the bloody welfare state . I mean , you can still afford a decent tailor . " He looks at me sharply : in my double-breasted wingding with the unfortu/nate stripe , I clearly have n't afforded one yet . " Would you care to have the name of mine ? " " Goddamnit , that 's decent of you , sir , " say I. " You 're a real white man . " Anyone who knew anything about America would see that I was dressed like a Broadway cowboy in my manic Americanness . But this simple fellow thought that even the best people dressed like that on the wrong side of the pond . Oh , I tell you , I was having a high time . This son of a manufacturerwas undertaking to turn Pendrid Chatworth into a gentleman . Let us leave them both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and brandy glasses , and laughing their own laughs . The tailoring question was just one of the hazards I was discovering in the Game . Of course I could afford his damn tailor . But how could I go to the Socialist Club in a fortyguineablazer ? Perhaps I could get a reversible one that turned into a duffel coat . What was the correct uniform for the Game ? It was not this , however , that ended my unbroken string of victories , but a lapse of understanding worthy of an earlier Chatworth . I grew a third face , which I frankly did n't think was in me , for the athletes of Paisley  --  not the best athletes in the world , but as coarse and unthinkingly joyful as good ones . At that age the knees and kidneys have n't gone , and they drink all night and whore as best they can ( in my experience , no group tries harder to less effect ) and sweat it all out next day in a cheerful stream . If they had been AmericanI would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with me that no Englishman was physically impressive , and no American intellectually . A good working prejudice , and no sillier than most . As it was , I fell into this face by accident . I was standing at the college bar listening to the lacrosse players stumble , asp184such dear fellows will , over the words of " The Good Ship Venus . " Since I knew about twenty-five verses from St. Bonifacedays , I chimed in softly , and then louder as I noticed them encouraging me . Everything a Yank does surprises them over here , and is immediately misunderstood . I would as soon touch a live grenade as a ball or bat or mace or club , yet I am taken at once for a jock . The legend of reckless virility embraces us all , even the pointy-headed exchange students . I am one of the boys . " What game do you play , Yank ? " This one . What I am playing right here . I ca n't help it . " American football , " I say despairingly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knee . " " How about rowing ? You 're big enough . " Trick wrist . Dizziness . Fear of heights . " I had n't thought about it . " Already the captain of rowing is at my side , practically holding out a contract . Everyone is watching : my tiny credit with these people is gone if I do n't play something . My mind gropes for alternatives ; almost all are ruled out by my putativetrick knee . Damnit . I do n't need this group . I 've got Tufnell and the socialists , and other worlds unknown . Still , the bar is small and warm and friendly ; there is an openness about these guys that is absolutely new to me . I do n't want to lose them . So rowing it is . God , what a miserable decision . The rowing men do not drink or carouse . The captain is a bluenose . He comes to the bar solely to recruit bodies . Even now , he is drinking a lemonade . He looks at the beer in my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looks as if you 've found another rabbit , Roger , " says a Hearty . " You fucking white slaver you . " They do not like him . He grins a gap-toothed grin : he does n't even look like them . Why had n't I seen that ? " Start training , Yank , " says a Hearty . " It 's past yourp185bloody bedtime . " The bar is suddenly chilly and indifferent . Beware the openness of athletes . They are like big dogs that maim you in fun . Of all the subjects I interview , none makes me more nervous . I will master them , you shall see . But for now it 's a defeat , and it reminds me of others , and I leave the bar feeling weak and drained . Fourth , fifth , and sixth faces to come . Perhaps my finest will be my man about town . This year 's crop of Gussie Marchbankses are fresh out of school and have a lot to learn ; I have been on the circuit , I have played @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leadership . I bring them wobbling from the nest , to instruct them in elementary arrogance and teach them their own game . There is nothing so sophisticated as a sophisticated American . Then there is the worm in the apple : my desire to have everything , even Englishness . I go to the London music halls and recognize another source of my wit . I am au fond a Cockney comedian . Gott in Himmel , I would be a French Apache and a Swiss yodeler if they 'd let me . Once one has mastered the art of assimilation there is no stopping it . I enter everyone like the curse of the body snatchers . I had wanderedthe streets of London like a Dickens child , and was here to claim that too . Finally , there will be Chatworth the actor , who puts all his shit together for the OUDS ( Oxford U. Drama Soc . ) . Yet this Chatworth will be the unhappy one . Although I never see an actor without seeing myself doing it better , I shy from the actual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face , I really threaten to become somebody else and it frightens hell out of me . I play Alfred Doolittle in Pygmalion and am praised for my uncanny mastery of cockney ; but this is what I do n't want . I have done it too well . Let me try to explain this to myself , because it is important . The one thing that holds me together is that I am an American doing thesep186things . I am not six different people , but one man doing six imitations . I must keep these artificial for the sake of my sanity . Chatworth the socialist and Chatworth the snob still have something in common : me . Real acting is a menace to this . I could lose myself in it forever . So I refuse to play anything but American parts , and get little work in this Shakespeare-sodden country . My bastard career is shaping up : Chatworth imitating Chatworth , accept no substitutes . Let me see now . I am a Catholic . I am an American . My nightly litany has all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effectiveness of a grace before English meals . " You know , you almost seem like an Englishman at times , " says Tufnell . " If it were n't for that extraordinary name of yours . Only Americans have pseudo-English names like that . " I remember my earlier resolve to frequent Americans and absorb their grace . Yet fate has granted me some strange Americans to frequent . The ones at Oxford are just the kind the English despise : their minds move like heavy machinery , and their tongues can barely keep up with their minds . They stare at you solemnly for a minute after you have spoken , and then the answer rumbles out as from a cave . They are stoodentsand I am ashamed of them . I know what the English are thinking . " They 're not typical , " I cry . " I 'm typical . " " Thank God for that , " huffs Tufnell . But perhaps they are typical . I may have made a mistake . There is only one American who reassures me , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ southern boy called Fletcher , who affects a down-home drawl and convulsesthe natives with such phrases as " rainin ' lak a cow pissin ' on a flat rock " or ( for the buck-toothed Master of Paisley ) " he could eat corn through a picket fence , " which they imagine he makes up as he goes along . He is a hustler , watchful , on to these people . Can he be real ? If so , my own authenticity pales before his souped-up ringding variety , and he would certainly be on to my game in no time : Yale ,  |p187Brooklyn  , polo , and stickball . Fortunately , I am a menace to him too , and we keep our duchies separate . Yale , Brooklyn  --  I have , God help me , even tried Texas and Winnipeg to remain an American , with all its privileges . I had better avoid Americans , the dimmest of whom could expose me . Yet without them , my accent falters and I find myself uttering little English cries . " Bugger it ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " As you guys would say , " I add . The first term was a joy , for all that . Oxford is bigger than it looks , and I could always find new groups to baffle . For instance , I spent an afternoon mastering the New York school of art ( and did n't know what to do with the last half-hour ) and presented myself as an expert on that . I also studied John Cage , if such be possible , and his use of the two-toned shotgun , and for the groundlings , Bix Beiderbecke and Bessie Smith and Leadbelly -- all , mind you , from their own libraries . And after I had Jenkinsed the arts , I began occasionally to invent : Wishbone DiMaggio at the washboard and Moms Hargrove , the nonverbal poet , and Slats Pettigrew , the primitivewithout portfolio  --  so pure that he refuses to name his art form . What madness was this ? Do I have a secret embarrassmentwish ? Or am I so in love with my own art that like the girl in the red shoes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know is that the tide began to turn in my second term . It started with a solemn Americanologist questioning my latest invention  --  Winthrop O'Toole and his chopsticks in blue ; I babble of obscure Decca labels and silence him for now . But he will be laying for me next time . And in every group there now turns out to be at least one man who knows more about America than any other living person ; the only thing that has saved me so far is their timidity in face of a live source . As my accent slipped , the buzzards seemed to gain confidence . First , I felt my short o 's going . Then I began avoidingp188words like first and third . My phrases were stilted and carefullyplanned . I was becoming a hunted man . When I asked a question at the Oxford Union in what I took to be my own accent ( it was one A.M. and the joint was empty ) , the Yorkshiremanwas waiting for me outside : " What happened to Brooklyn , you crafty booger ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His face reddened ( a rare thing in real life ) and I thought he was going to hit me . But it must have been a trick he had , like wiggling his ears . Because he said , " Funny . So does mine , old chap , " which gave me the heart to go on a little longer . Then the trap closed from another direction . My sister came to visit . Where could I hide her ? She had now become quite floridly and excessively English , gulping it down as I had my Americanness . People should not be allowed to choose these things . Even the English must have found her funny . She was saying everything but " pip , pip . " I smuggled her out of Paisley somehow , which was n't easy , since some of the lacrosse players loutishly prowled the quad for woman visitors at all hours . " Hey Mac " ( I might as well confess , I had buried Pendrid under this nickname ) . " Introduce me , wo n't you , Mac @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , to an oaf . " It 's my sister Lulu , " I muttered . " What are you talking about , Pendrid ? " Her voice pealed across Oxford . " Yeah , sure , Lulu . Quit your kidding . " I said desperately , " Lulu 's a great kidder . " The oafs were all at sea , fortunately . Prissy gave me a quizzical look . " Sorry , pardner , " she said at last . " I was just putting on the dog for the folks . " Our old alliance had reasserted itself just in time . But outside on High Street she demanded explanations . " It 's a game . They think I 'm an American . " " Just those people ? Or everyone ? "  | " Some people , " I croaked . " Here and there . " " How desolately silly , " she said . " Why ? It 's what I want to be . You made me come back here . I want to be an American . " " Pen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made you come back . And you ca n't just be an American by wanting to . " " Why not ? " " It 's unhealthy . You 'll grow up all crooked like some sort of cripple . The Americans wo n't believe you , and the English wo n't care . " She looked concerned . It was a cold day , and my eyes were watering . " Just be yourself , Pen , if you can manage it . " " And , pray , what is myself ? " I said angrily . I did n't care to be called a cripple , though now I take it as my due . " Am I half-ass English ? Or maybe something from Goose Bay or Labrador ? You do n't think you 're English do you , Prissy ? That imitation would n't fool a Harvard linguist . " Prissy suddenly looked doubtful . " Do you really think so ? " She took my arm . " What a pair of freaks we both are . Let 's have some tea . " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child . Yet when we talk about it now she is all amusement . " What a lot of nonsense it all was . And do you remember the rest of that bally afternoon ? Cousin Cynthia joining us for tea , and then your ghastly friend from the Midlands ? " That was Tufnell , and I remember it all too well . He came over for some good Yankee palaver , chewing the fat as it were , and got , for his pains , an earful of rankest London tea-party chatter . Cynthia was at Somerville it turned out , and all her friends were at the House or Magdalen or some such . " How did you ever wind up at a slum like Paisley ? " she asked me brightly . Tufnell looked gloomily at his own Paisleytie . " Your pa-pah went to Balliol , did n't he ? I know your grand-pa-pah did . " Oh , spare me this part . Tufnell 's Yank is turning into a prince and I do n't want to watch . But years later Prissyp190insists for once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was utterly poleaxed by Cynthia , was n't he ? His jaw flapped and his tiny eyes simply swam . " She goes too far . " It was all rather naughty of Cynthia . You remember what a flaming Red she was in those days ? And she could n't bear snobs . So when she spotted your man in Grain Futures , she fairly lit after him , and old-familied him to death . " I feign a smile . It is true enough in essentials . But Cynthia was n't that good , and Tufnell was n't that graceless . It is common for top people to assume they 've routed bottom people and annihilated middle people . In fact , he behaved with more dignity than any of us . " I thought you were American ? " " I am , sort of . " I stonewalled as long as I could , claiming not to have heard of Cousin Arbuthnot or of Farnsworth Hall , or of anything at all east of the Brooklyn Dodgers . But Cynthia was relentless ; she had admired me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sort of Englishman now . " Oh come off it , you old fraud . You 're as English as I am . I know about your shooting box in Scotland . I know about the famous scene at White 's . " My God , it was Millicent all over again . And I was suddenlyone of them , tormenting an outsider . Was I enjoying it a little ? Does a yogi enjoy his nails ? I grinned apologeticallyat Tufnell but he chewed on stolidly as if nothing were happening . Please do n't let him lick his fingers . Before it ended , Prissy was loyal enough to try to help out . " Cynthia , do n't be an ass . You know Pendrid has n't got a shooting box , or anything approaching a shooting box . " In that voice it did n't help much . " He really is an American by adoption , you know . " Cynthia laughed merrily . " That 's like announcing you 've become a Negro . Congratulations , Pen . I do mean the very warmest ones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " So veryp191becoming , " she lisped , sighed , gurgled . " It matches your tie . " Tufnell had had enough . I held my breath . He stood up OK , but then he said , " Pleased to meet you , " and spoiled everything . I felt a sick delight , like a cop kicking a pervert in the balls . He deserved it , as we all do , I suppose , one way or another . " I ca n't impress on you enough , " said Cynthia , shaking his hand vigorously , " how incredibly English Pendrid really is . To the bone , Mr. Tufnell , to the bone . " He made his way out without incident . Maybe he tripped on something , but I 'm practically sure he did n't fall down the stairs . " You should n't have done that , " said Prissy . " Why not ? He was awful , " said Cynthia . " And now . Pendrid . Tell me . Why have n't you come to see me ? I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you were here . " " Ah , so that 's why you cross the street whenever you see me coming . You think I 'm somebody else . Possibly a typhoid carrier . " So that was it . An act of blind vengeance had been executed on poor Tufnell simply because I 'd cut poor Cousin Cynthia . " Why do n't you come to the Socialist party meetings ? " I counter weakly . " Socialist ? " she squeaks . " I 'm far to the left of all that bourgeois muck . I 'm with the Marxist-Leninists , the , ' ow ' you say in your country ? Big Banana . Yes , I 'm down air wivver real workers , ducks . " Mr. Smooth fairly writhed . And enjoyed.  |p192I  felt rotten the next day . Tufnell favored me with what was to become his standard grunt when I saw him later in the quad , until by now his sad porcine face comes to me as a mute , suffering Jesus , to add to my collection ; but at the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I worried about me . What the hell was I doing ? I had n't set out to be a fraud . Fraudulence had been thrust upon me by history . When I was a small boy , the dimmest cousins could tease and hoodwinkme ; I needed my aunts ' jokes explained ; dulled-eyed errand boys scoffed . " They 're only pulling your leg , Pendrid . " Who , where ? My sister 's meaningless laughter follows me down the years . I am still humorless , under the tinsel . Yet here I was , capering fiendishly in the world 's fraud capital , reducing fat men to tears . Well , I 'd put a stop to it right now . Make a clean breast of it . Tell a few key people . Nail my pedigree to the church door . However , it is n't always so easy to phase out of fraudulence , even at Oxford . I did tell a few people who I really was , and they either did n't care ( the captain of rowing most conspicuously ) or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Though mind you : " Chatworth , it wo n't really wash . Englishmen are born and not made . Besides why would you want to be one , and give up all your lovely dollars ? " " Have it your way , " said the captain of rowing . " It means balls-all to me . " Where had I heard this before ? Somewhere back in the St. Boniface murk it came to me : " Still a limey prick to us . " They 're still pulling your leg , Pendrid . In my heavy , literal way , I was trying to get too much out of nationality , sucking at it till my face was blue . And I thought the joke was onthem . The clubs were empty by this time of year , as everyone had rushed for the river , where they crouched like Hindus during a plague , but the confessional fever was on me and I went to the Socialist Club anyway and poured out my mind to five or six chaps in ragged sportscoats who stared back at me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sweet May nights keeping the place open did n't remember that I came from Brooklyn , did n't care . " Suit yourself , " said the president in response to my wailing retraction . " It really does n't matter . " " But I lied about my class , " I cried . " Well , I daresay you would n't be our first member to do that . " I looked around for my Yorkshireman , but he was long gone . To the ballet society , no doubt . " Now if you do n't mind , we 'd like to get on with something just a little meat-ier . " " But is n't this meaty enough for you ? All the chaps who come in here juggling their pasts , their accents , their very selves ? How can you have a politics of meat if people do that ? " Yes , well , very awkward this . " I must say that this would seem to be a rather personal problem of your own . The sort of thing one has leisure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too poor to worry about our identities . " There is a gruff burble of agreement from the chaps . Even on this warm night they pull their scarves tighter against thep194dank air of the coal mine . Actually , they have spent all their lives in lonely libraries , being weaned away from their class and being thought sissies for their pains , but up here they are workers . And their accents will grow thicker every week that Oxford pulls them further from home . ( See Chatworth , Oxbridgeand the Revolt Against Rising Expectations The Listener , Oct. , 1968 . ) I can only say they seemed fearfully authentic at the time . Everyone seemed authentic . I accepted their judgment , and anyone else 's who cared to make one . Not an American ! One of my crutches is missing . I furl myself round the other . But not yet . My first reaction is to wallow in phoniness , to exaggerate it , to become the hollowest , emptiest , most alienated kid on the block . In short , to keep acting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chaplaincy . Which is awkward because I already have a girl . But this is getting tangled and I do n't see why I should straighten it out for you , you nasty little tape recorder . I 've had better drinking companions than you , my friend  --  better listeners too . Yes , I had a little drink tonight in the safety of my hotel room . Claridge 's wo n't snitch . Owing to some opening to the West I find myself on the Queen 's goddamned honors list . How do you like them apples , Tufnell old bean ? Back to England to pick up my garter or whatever . You 'd drink too , you beastly little object . In fact , I 'm turning youoff RIGHT NOW . Click . We return you to our studios . No one to talk to , so on we go again . I 've really come to depend on you , you know that , Father ? Fah ! The only Father will be me , when I play the tape back and absolve myself handsomely . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and congratulate myself on a life well spent . But for now  --  you say I should do the thing with the girls , Father ? Oh , all right . But let 's wait till the morning , when I can remember their names and wo n't cry so loudly . OK , little buddy ? An MBE  --  Christ what an insult for a Chatworth . It 's an honor just above dogcatcher and below common hangman ;  |p195but  any honor would be an insult from those born-again Krauts . You understand , of course , that the real Queen Elizabeth used to hang Chatworths like dogs for not joining her piss-ant religion ? Yeah , the Crown crapped nonstop on my people for three solid centuries , but I 'll teach them . I 'll take their damned award . I ca n't afford not to . Yeah , and I know how drunks talk too . Do n't I do it right , old buddy pal , huh ? Upon my word , yes . Phrases for all occasions . Can also cry real tears in two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it if I disconnected your batteries , you goddamn spy ? And a good good morning to you . I was n't that drunk , I think ; I was just trying to shake something loose : what it was escapes me . Anyway , it seems that Mr. Snead is back in town . The MBE has attracted his squinty attention . He ca n't wait to stand in line with all those jockeys . I only hope he does n't do one of his mad dances and sprinkle the Queen with holy water . And it is n't just Snead , it 's all of them . For instance , I thought I 'd buried the quiet American , the lonely plainsman by moonlight , on the way home from the Socialist Club that night . Yet here he is again , homesteading my skull and spitting on my honors . An award from the Queen ? Hot shit . Does that mean you get to lay her ? Oh , just some letters after your name . I get it . That 's real cute . So what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is really no award I can comfortably enjoy  --  although the Nobel Peace Prize might be OK . Can I send a messenger ? " One MBE , just sign here , mum . " No , NBC wants me there in quivering person . They want to ask me afterwards what it felt like . Jesus . I hope they do n't get Snead by mistake . But now , two hours to countdown , we 'll do the girls , the girls . In my manic phase before the unmasking , I had met my first big-league Englishwoman , an undergraduate from Lady Margaret Hall , whose great brown eyes alone couldp196command me like a dog trainer . In those days at Oxford , the men outnumbered the women by about nine to one , and the good-looking women by infinity . So Diana was a trophy , and I only beat the competition because I thought Yankees had magic powers . " Do you like Americans ? " I ask her once just to confirm this . " Not especially . " " Then you must at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Not especially , " she smiles . " I think I like you , but that 's rather different . It does n't commit one to a whole continent . " Oh well , my bigotry had done the trick for me by then . My rivals , counting the odds , had dropped away in despair . To me , the best of them looked malnourished , nervous , ill-coordinated ; the big ones had outgrown their bones , and such good teeth as occurred were only a front . So I went busting through like O. J. Simpson ( nice chap , by the way ) . This was the American century , and the woolliest Rhodes scholars were making out like thunder . So with my Yankee virility and limey know-how , there was no stopping me . I started out in the traditional Oxford way by rescuing Diana from a party . ( Everybody in England wants to be rescued from parties : it 's what makes the system work . ) In this case , the native oafs were obviously planning to surge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clumsy services in a great roar . So I beat them to it by perching on her armchair and crooning , " Would you like to take a walk ? " She looked up calmly , appraising me at leisure , perhaps actually thinking . " Why not ? " she said at last . The oafs fell back stunned as I whisked her past them . " That was a boring party , was n't it ? " I said , as we clattereddown somebody 's staircase . " Was it ? What was boring about it ? " Eh ? What was this ? Everybody knew that parties werep197boring . Safest remark in the world . Was she a foreigner of some kind ? " Well , if it was n't boring , why did you leave with me ? " Pause . " Curiosity , I suppose . I wondered what masterful thing you 'd do next . " Nothing actually . I had no plan . Chatworth 's urbanity occasionally sprang these leaks . " Pub ? " I said . " All right , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Can you think of somethingmasterful for me to do ? " I said . " Not a blessed thing . But then , it 's not my game . " We went to the Queen 's Arms , where my friends stared like wolves and clamored for introductions , and she drank cider and was very sweet with them . I was quite proud of the little Sabine woman I 'd thrown over my shoulder and brought here , but ashamed of my hairy-nostriled brothers . " God knows , they 're not much , " I muttered . " What 's wrong with them ? " she said . " Oh , come on . Not again . Tolerance must stop some place . " " Well , perhaps , perhaps . " After that we had tea and fried tomatoes , or whatever they were serving those days , in a cafe on High Street , and then more clip-clop to Lady Margaret Hall where she had to be home by twelve o'clock . It seemed to be against university regulations to be masterful . Until I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ date I could have , and one passed gloomy undergraduates crisscrossing after identical evenings . " Can I see you again ? " I said at the gate . " I think so , " she said . " What does that mean ? " " What it says . It generally does with me , " she said rather tartly . " Look , I hate to be a bore , but there are complications . Do you mind ? I 'll let you know . " She kissed my cheek and was gone like a dream . As she disappeared , I thought ,  |p198God  that girl trots beautifully . It was the most ardent thought I 'd had all evening , I suppose because I was watching her for a change . As I raced for my own deadline at Paisley , I thought , " Did I sparkle ? What did she make of Chatworth ? " I assumed the complications were another guy . Some English smart-ass who chattered like a magpie . Well , I 'd take him . I 'd outchatterhim if necessary . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt some of the old St. Boniface blood pounding . " Let 's get ' em , gang . " You see , I was n't always a little old man . I could be young on special occasions . You 'll see , Queen . It was typical of Diana that whatever the complications were , she disposed of them quickly and neatly . If they were another chap , she did n't leave him dangling : down he came with one snip , and up went Chatworth . There were no tearstainedex-lovers in our wake , no sunken wrecks with half a hope . Whatever she said she must have said clearly . I did my caveman act a couple more times , dragging her into tea shops on sight or going on bracing walks ( ah , Oxford ) , and one day she said , " Why not ? "  --  our code phrase . The third time she said it , about two weeks later , left my knees trembling to this day . But my confessor wants no part of smutty talk . It upsets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the good news either , about how innocently happy we were . There can be no defendant in the confessional , deflecting God 's mercy with his puling rationalizations . There is only accusation , stripping the subject bare for the rays of Grace to strike . This is as it should be . I am a black belt at making myself look good . It is my profession . However , it 's quite in order to make your victims sound good , as saintly as possible in fact , to highlight your own nastiness . In the Catholic world view each of us is a wharf rat surrounded by snow . So I shall tell the story in terms of Diana 's virtues , which I may exaggerate outlandishly . I am not under oath , you know.  |p199Proceeding  in this spirit : Diana was so incorruptible that I thought for a while it was a trick . She passed through the jungle book of Oxford life untouched , as if she were really being tutored the while on her father 's lawn by saintly bishops . Of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times to the troglodytes who swore in their beer that you could n't get a good woman up here , but she said , " Pendrid ! You do n't even like them . " I was stuck . " There 's no such thing as a bore , " I murmured . " Oh yes there is , and you know it . The planet teams with them . " " Even at Axford Cahlege England ? " " Here 's where it all begins , yes . And fans out . This is n't exactly Flahrence Idaly , you know . " " But was Florence itself really Florence ? " says Chatworth , who knows his donnish prattle by now . " Of course not , " she says . " That 's what literature is for . " One last try . " I thought that since you found our hosts interesting the other night , you would put up with anything , " I croaked amusingly . " Is n't that rotten luck ? They were interesting . Do you want your money back ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through Christ Church meadows ? I have developed a picture postcardmind about it . She is invariably dressed like a Henry James heroine , while I prance by her side in various regalia  --  cowboy hats , boaters , side whiskers , whatever seems appropriate . Why are my bad dreams so clear and sure of themselves and the good ones so thin and silly ? Anyway , I am now stuck with a beautiful girl and no one to show her to , and must make the best of it . It seems she has come to Oxford out of intellectual excitement , something that had n't occurred to me , so I decide to try that , with grave misgivings . Diana puts me onto literature and painting for the first time in my life ( I think my father thought they were middlep200class )  --  although , again typically , she says if I want to talk music I 'll have to look elsewhere . Since I had half-consciouslythought of culture as a means of getting ahead , I assumed that it did n't matter which art you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ posed as a genial Philistine like my father and scored points that way . A light flashes briefly into my sewer . My mother liked the arts  --  the worst examples of each . Strauss waltzes , Kipling , Murillo . That was what happened if you listened to your instincts . Disgrace . Better to fence , as I fenced now with Diana . Although she could not even understand lying , and was game for the plucking , I could only bluff so far with Proust ( " I liked the part in the middle " ) and James or Tolstoy , so I came on as a raw youth eager to learn . It was understood I had an unspoken interest in frontier literature and the Adams family , but we did n't press it . Remember , I am still mad and trembling with my imitations . The scene with Tufnell has n't happened yet and I am trying on hats faster and faster . After my noble afternoons with Diana ( tea at her place , tea at my place . Oxford ! ) , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from prairie and factory ( the likes of Luigi Seltzer , who actually hired a bottling plant in Kearny , New Jersey , and just let it blast away ) and painters who only used white and all the pulsing excitement of America . I exaggerate the names but not the fever . I am throwing a whole lifetime of dislocation into the performance . Luigi Seltzer , c ' est moi . And the next day I return to my cloister , as one joins a minuet , and once again Gary Cooper takes milady 's small volume in his big raw hands and says something unbelievably sensitive about it . " I really think you have the essence , the root of the matter , Mac . " ( She thinks the name Mac sounds delicious in such sentences . ) " Well , shucks , ma'am , I ai n't much for book learning . " We laugh and snuggle . " But seriously , Pendrid , it 's excitingto see someone come to books a bit late , with some realp201experience of life behind him . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . " " And talking of experience of life " . . . at this time I am more American than Catholic , and her acceptance of sex is so open and obvious that my moral qualms have n't time to warm up . What had been intended as an obligatory salesman'spass over the teacups glides without a snag into lovemaking . No wait a bit while I change , turn out the light , unhook this , get more comfy ; no checkpoints for the inspectors , but a ski run into clear blue air . And so it remains . Either that , or a " not today , " said so quickly it has n't time to hurt . My moral defenses were bypassed like the Maginot Line ; or at least I think they were . Again , I can not remember my virtues . Only a fellow schizoid will understand how these aestheticallypurifying sessions , far from purging my heart , gave me more strength for the evening bouts of fraud . Perhaps I felt in some twisted way that I was doing it for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excuse for a drink . I showed off because they let me ; and because lying was the truth about me , the performance I offered to God , and the lady . And , of course , it was meant to be funny . So that was my life , a fairly typical Oxford one you may say , until the Tufnell incident , at which point my passion to confess took that great incongruous leap forward . I suppose it would have happened anyway , and was for the best , but all the starch had gone out of Tufnell . No more swagger , no more colored waistcoats . Even his voice had stopped soundinglike a hunting call . Shrink , shrink , shrink , like a Lewis Carroll character . In my modest way , I took total responsibility for this , and felt I must atone to someone . It was as if Tufnell had invested in the South Sea bubble . But I could n't tell Diana . As a veteran liar , I recognized a truth virgin when I saw one , and I knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lie from a loved one . I learned it from Mother , as a matter of fact , when I was about six , and it had something to do with cake . I might as wellp202have mugged the poor woman . But I must tell someone now precisely what I 've been up to , to insure that there will be no more Tufnells . Obviously the captain of rowing was a poor choice : I had counted on his morbid contempt , but not on his jeering indifference ( however , it did give me an excuse to resign my oar and leave them a man short , ha ha ) , and the Socialist Club was not much better . Here I was , showing them a real cancer eating their society , and they preferred to talk about nationalizing marmalade . Oh well , their choice . My last throw of the dice is an actual confession to the Catholic chaplain , a dim but courteous old fellow renowned for his meandering advice . Penitents have been known to dash off before his absolution so as not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , eh ? Oh , you say you 're not American . " " No , I said I 'm sort of American . " This is going to be hard to explain in whispers . " I see . Sort of American . Well , that 's very interesting in its way . But you know , you do n't have to state your nationalityin confession . " " No , I understand . But the thing is , I lied about it . " " Lied about what ? Being American ? That is n't so terribly serious , is it ? " He realized he was guilty of levity with a troubled , possibly deranged soul . " Well , I suppose it 's wrong to lie about anything at all , but honestly , I should n't disturb yourself too much over this comparatively minor offense . " He sounded dazed . " It 's not that , " I hiss through the wire . " It 's all the lies that followed . One lie leads to another , you know , until there 's really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Silence , as the good man tries to cope . " It does sound complicated , " he mutters . I can tell he has no mental picture , so I blunder on , using simple examples . " I mean , suppose they ask what part of America you come from and you say Texas . ' " " What was that ? "  | " Texas . " " Texas . Ah , I see . " " And they say what did you do in Texas . " . . . ah , this is hopeless . To accommodate the old fool , I have simplified the problem out of existence . " Look . " I raise my voice . " I became somebody else . I lied about the soul God gave me . That 's a sin , is n't it ? " The raised voice gave him the clue he needed . " That is n't Chatworth , is it ? I 'd know your father 's voice anywhere . " Blood freezes . Great Moments in the box . My real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest are fakes . " Oh yes , yes . Knew him well . Upon my soul , have n't seen much of you , Chatworth . Yes yes , well well . " I kneel , crushed , barely breathing . " Must try a bit more of the sacraments , you know . Minds sometimes get muddled up here , oh yes they do . But a little of His healing grace can do wonders . . . yes , yes , knew your father well . Marvelous man , marvelous Catholic . Used to make retreats with him . He actually talked about becoming a priest . Just as well he did n't , eh ? Just as well for you at any rate . Yes , next thing to a saint . " I block my ears , until it 's all over . When I unplug them there is silence again . Has he gone ? He says , " That was a very good confession , my son . Pray for me . " The fluty upper-class voice sounds impatient . I have outstayed my welcome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have been spared this , at least . In the black stillness , God laughs till the tears come . I wandered around town wondering whether I was forgiven , or whether my case had even been heard . I bumped viciously into some people in scarves and belted raincoats . Get your teeth fixed , all of you . This is my father speaking . Being untrue to yourself is not a sin . It is not even serious . I can get no help in the confessional , though I shall never cease trying . It is the only place I can tell the truth , but they wo n't listen . It 's a small boy 's sin at best , good for a chuckle . There 's nothing for it  --  I shall have to try Diana . She seems in memory to have been waiting all along , and I start right in , " Bless me , Diana , for I have sinned . " No , surely not . Shep204is as usual sitting by the teapot , hand raised to pour . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be a more complete act . My sister would be perfect , but she 'd laugh louder than anyone . So I shoot the penitential works that night , gushing like all the fountains at Versailles , even making up new frauds involuntarily as they flash through my mind . God knows how , and by what subterranean tricks of technique , but I must have managed to sound funny and adventurous about it , because at the end she said , " How romantic , Pen . You are an artist . " " But I 've hurt people . " " Of course . " I rallied slightly . Artist , eh ? That was n't so bad . My hands trembled over a new toy . " And have you lied to me ? " she asked . " No , " I lied . That was the one that did it . But my mind wanders . Artist , by George . Why had n't I thought of that ? Roaming the streets just now , a thin mask of pain . Was that or was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it now by cheering up too quickly . " I feel driven and exhilarated at the time and then sick with shame afterwards . " Her eyes glittered . My God , she was buying it . If an Englishmanhad talked like this , she 'd have known he got it from a book . But this was Gary Cooper , the raw material of books , and he was proving the books were true . " You 're a dear , " she said , hugging me to her cardigan . " My dear sweet artist . " I can not go straight if I want to . " You do n't mind lying ? " I croaked . " Not if it 's done beautifully enough . Most lies are so clumsy and ugly . The others we call Art . " So now , nothing remained but to find an art for me to practice  --  as one picks a beau for an heiress . Tomorrow we shall go out shopping . But first , let me introduce you properlyto Diana , whom I am just meeting for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been the prettiest girl in the room ; and , of course , my teacher , of which I can never have enough . But today she is all I 've got , so I must pay attention . Every mask in my garbage can represents a lost friend , or at least an escape . Now I am down near the skin . Diana Godwin is fearfully bright . She will undoubtedly get a first in modern languages without breaking a sweat . In fact , she is so good she spends most of her time reading other subjects . She is also totally without vanity , which is as bafflingto Chatworth as a missing feature . Perhaps women do n't need vanity . She is at least to my taste nerve-rackingly beautiful . Small , with dark eyes  --  oh , what 's the use . Pin on the face of your choice . Outside of a fine English chest , she does not look particularly English , an excellent thing in a woman . ( Plunkettjests that his partner will not cry . Snead for all his vileness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Roman garden at dusk with a voice like bells , and that 's all there is to it . Rocked in her arms , flooded with the sense of another person , Chatworth could have sworn he had grown up . And so he had , so he had . But the world is full of ways to reverse that . Now if Chatworth the newly born artist had thrown away that mask too , before it hardened , and then the skintightone underneath  --  ah , but you 're asking him to throw away his face and that 's a bit much . But he is close enough tonight . He is almost real . Hail and farewell . And now I 'm off to pick up my little tin star from Her Majesty.  |p206I  've met them all , of course : the king of Basutoland , the Dalai Lama , Tricky Dick . So do n't imagine that this Hanoverian interloper cuts any ice with me . Her ancestors were grunting around the forest in Germany while mine were backing the wrong Rose ; I know they later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd know that crowd anywhere  --  the funniest aggregation since the Marx Brothers . " Ah Emily , let 's get married . All three of us . " Say , let 's give her a hotfoot , Muldoon . So why are you grinning again , Chatworth ? " Well , I supposeany Englishman has to feel a little bit proud , Jack . It 's one of the few remaining symbols that still means something , is n't it ? " The Americans will kill me if I do n't say this . I am a hostage of NBC . " Oh yes , very gracious , very gracious indeed . And unpretentious , of course . That 's the main thing , is n't it ? " I am led away babbling . " Unpretentious , oh Lord yes , unpretentious and unassuming , too . " Diana 's work of art has come to a pretty pass . But that was long ago and in the same country.  |p207The  rest of the summer term would bore you frightfully , Father . Nothing but conversation and innocent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not your sort of thing at all . Not while you 're on duty anyway , squatting there in your little tape recorder . Innocent lovemaking ? Yes , I 'll swear it . She once actually commanded me to read some Henry James before meeting her , so that the two of them are still improbably entwined and I hear the bells of San Marco as I wait for my lover . And if that is n't innocent , I 'll eat my cassock . But do n't worry , the snake will be along shortly and old James will be banished to his tea set . An integrated Chatworthcannot hold for long : other Chatworths stir and demandto be heard from . " I am American , I am a Catholic "  --  the phrases had dropped away like " God bless Mummy and Daddy , " or like the rosaries I used to say with O'Connor to the sounds of Jimmy Durante . But they had only gone underground to work up more sophisticated routines . Omen : " You must stay in Europe forever , " says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You really go for that , huh ? " " Only when there 's someone terribly nice to be decadent with . A rugged , uncorrupted American , say . " " Sorry . That sounds just too damn cute . " " Does it ? I suppose that 's just what a rugged , uncorrupted American would say . What a pity ! " The man-about-Mayfair winces . Buzz off , you tiresome plainsman . Yet I had meant it when I said it , and still do . I hate cuteness and revel in it . Lord hear my prayer . Omen : Chatworth : " You would n't happen to be religious , would you ? " " I do n't know yet . " She always writhes earnestly in the presence of ideas . " Is that something you are or just something you 'd like to be ? I mean is it like blue eyes , or more like , " she kissed my lids , " this . "  |p208I  also writhe in the presence of ideas , though no one knows . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , supposing you do n't meet the right church ? " " And how do I know when the right church comes along ? " " Stars fall on St. Peter 's and you smell incense everywhere . No , you see , that 's what the Catholic Church objects to . Romantic individualism . But I 'm sounding pompous . " " Go on . I love it when you 're pompous . " I 'd been hoping , almost praying , to avoid this . It was a sin to leave someone in darkness . Yet I 'd somehow worked the conversation around to a point where I had to do something . For now , I brushed it aside like a leaf . The love between us was still so intense that I could bury my head in it and forget anything I wanted to  --  Rome , America , the rusty voice in the box . Finding an art for me proved more difficult than we 'd expected . Classical music put my feet to sleep and museums were like torture chambers . I began to feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see the point of music and painting . They seemed like vulgar middle-class additions to the main thing  --  life itself . " That sounds very Protestant of you , " said Diana , who for all her art history never really understood aristocracy . The Chatworths were above culture . Or rather , they were culture . Drawings and tunes were for the servants . I 'm not a snob , but blue blood can cheer you up when all else is gone , and right now I 'm reeling from a man-killing blow to my pride . We are up river in a bower of willows that would enhance even Rod McKuen , and I have played my ace , a brace of rugged verses written specially for Diana . I am confident that their stark simplicity puts them outside literary judgment ; but now as I watch her struggle with her disappointment , I realize that there are standards even for stark simplicity . " Of course , it 's not my sort of thing , " she says . " I guess not . "  |p209She  frowns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Johnny Eagle " ) sets out West in his jalopy . " But you 're not really like this , you know , " she says at last in raw agony . " You 're not primitive at all , you 're  --  something else . " What , what ? Throw me a bone , a fragment of compliment . " Perhaps you 're something new and there is n't a voice for you yet . Perhaps you 're trying to borrow one . " Nurse presses my hand soothingly  --  " You 're so much better than your poems , " she says , leading me grinning into a fresh tiger trap . If I am so much better than my work , there must be some inherent quality in me . And since my rotten cousin Cynthia has just reminded me of my ancestry , I reach blindly for that . Well , I had to do something . Diana was infinitely brighter than I , and she had culture by the throat . She could have paralyzed a less resourceful man . The louts at the college @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who obviously terrified them . For all their own intelligence , half the guys at Paisley were paralyzed by the female kind and so talked with brutal swagger of subduing it with " a yard of this . " " They 'd rather read about it anyway . " " That 's because they never had it , " etc . I at least did not do that . I was already on to these pale-faced clerics who talked like coal miners and Latin lovers in their sanctuaries . My acts were always better than that . But a man must fill himself with something , and ineffable worth lay to hand . If Diana the art-goddess worshiped me , I must be in some sense an art object myself . So while I take my time finding my voice ( please , her eyes begged , no more poems ) , I will make my life my art . Well , OK . I swear it was not calculation but mere good chance that made this my most useful decision to date . Up to now , I had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but Diana taught me to plane and smooth them all and blend them into a single Self that I could take anywhere . Thus my raw American had been a gag for Englishp210consumption , but there was a real Americanness in back of it that just might work . Not a lonesome man on a horse , that could n't even fool an Englishman for long , but something perhaps from the New York area . Over here , Manhattan sophistication seemed as tough and crackling as Chicago machine guns , so I did n't have to give up my hard-man image , just dress it in a dinner jacket . And then my innate Englishness , in dry ice since the twenties and thirties , could complement it perfectly like a splash of handkerchief or the right cuff links . As such , I was a prewar luxury item that could almost be advertised in the New Yorker . While , beneathall that , she saw sturdy and plain an English recusant family , immune to fashions , playing with them , transcending them . God , she thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sensibilities on fire , set to work like a tailor making this new fellow real . She did not do it explicitly , but more as one would guide a deaf person through a maze . She signaled with little smiles and nods when I was on the right track , or with the most delicate disappointment when I slipped into one of my old routines . Her eye for the genuine would have opened a safe , and by the end of summer term I was so genuine that I was a complete fake , a restoration , a fraud of world class . But I was real to her , her lovely work of art , and I was real to me , and at the end of term we went to all the college balls we could manage and drank toasts to George Eliot and the Tradition and danced the Charleston ( God knows how , but she even did that well ) and floated with luminous fatigue through floodlit gardens . Again the good is interred in picturepostcards . All my selves came together with a bang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glass in hand , cracking wise  --  this was my definitive statement . A free spirit at ease in the family uniform . Not the best Englishmannor yet the best American , but the two together , voila . At some point , almost too groggy to speak , I muttered the word " love " for the first time and she said , " Why yes , ofp211course . " As we embraced , she said , " You Americans are so slow . " And this was true . The word " love " had great weight for me then ; it was like saying God 's name out loud . " You really mean it , do n't you , Pen ? " " Oh yes . " " My precious humbug . " She squeezed me . " My darling fraud . You 'll never know how real you really are . " This was true too . I never will . A day or two after that we were standing together on the platform of crushed dreams on the down side of Oxford station and she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all be different . Never mind . " " Why do women always say things like that ? " " It 's our insurance policy . Our painkiller . But I wo n't regret anything , ever . I promise . " Ah , you little stoic . Her eyes did n't even mist over , mine did . Bless these women for their toughness . They will need it against Chatworth . I 'm sure I mumbled " never " and " darling . " But I could n't shake a tear out of her any which way . The point was , we were not going to meet during the summer . She was going to Germany on some student thing , and I had promised to go to Italy with my mother and sister . Why did n't I chuck that ? Something passive and cautious in me perhaps . In the Black Forest , my flabby personality , which was all highlights , would have been rearranged in some new way by Diana . She knew the language and Europe was her playground . I must go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother and sister ? It could n't be helped . After a brief round of jaunty widowhood , " doing the things I always wanted to , " Mother had lapsed back into a leaky helplessness . Like me , she had been propped up invisibly by my father and now flopped like a cushion without him . And she always seemed to land on Prissy , who had once again been forced to postpone her dream of living alone . " You must come , " Prissy had wired . " I ca n't stand it by myself . " I passed this on to Diana , and she did n't answer , exceptp212for that slight tensing of the lips that said , " You 're wrong . " For the sake of love , mothers and sisters must die . A man of quality would know that . That 's why she knew that next term would be different . If Pendrid the art object planned to spend the summer as housemaid , it was no defect in him : he just did n't love her , that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ booze and moonlight ; but if he had really meant it , he would come with her , now . How did I know all that ? Because she had taught me so well . I knew the ways of the heart inside out by now . So picture Chatworth , eyes streaming , waving through the windowat his dry-eyed sweetheart as the train lurches out . Forget her , eh ? I might be flabby , but I 'm stubborn . I made a vow that I would still love her in October . And I kept it in my fashion . But first , down to Rome with Mum and Sis , cursing myself for a big baby , and sullen with the two of them as only a baby can be . " You might as well have stayed home , " said Prissy as I pouted around the pensione the first night . But Mother seemed glad to have me in whatever form I took , and she kept throwing me shy little smiles until my nerves screamed afresh . She would do anything right now to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For this I had given up my love . Oh well . I remembered the fine mature person I 'd become in Diana 's arms , and tried to think instinctively what he would do . Well , he would certainly not let his family make him childish again . And he would not mistake being a brat for being a stormy romantic . In fact ( and this was the hard part ) , he would not even have to think what he would do  --  he would know . So I knew . It 's only now that I see the fiendish acrobatics of all this . And only now that I realize how much I needed to impress Prissy . I wanted to show her I was learning things about life that she would never learn , outgrowing her and outdeepen/ing her : not realizing that we were jumping together in the same sack . So I told Prissy I was sorry to be a pill , but that I 'd left someone behind . And she said , " You too ? Ah , what we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's a bloody great pyre in our case , is n't it ? " We became sort of friends again on that , though I was committed to the idea that she was superficial . We tried to do Rome together , leaving Mum to knit endless scarves and blankets ( she could n't turn corners , but simply abandoned things after a while and gave them names ) . But Priscilla was indeed superficial . She thought the old churches were monumentsof superstition . " But they 're beautiful , " I pipe . " Oh yes , that , " says she . " How many people died to build them ? " " If you really cared , you 'd know , " I said . ( My history tutor , Mr. Short , used arguments like that a lot ; he felt they were invaluable in examinations . ) " Starved and toiled for a God who was planning to boil them in hell for not coming here every Sunday . " Where to begin ? Her view of the late Middle Ages was n't worthy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's like Daddy 's funeral , " she went on . " I do n't know if you followed all the rigmarole , but do you realize they spent half the time apologizing for the poor man 's sins ? Daddy ! " She sobbed . " The kindest man who ever lived . " " He would have understood , " I said . And suddenly , so did I. My perfect father went to confession every week of his life . He knew the score . Here in St. John Lateran feelings swell and soar grandly . My father  --  almost a saint , except that it would have been pushy  --  knew that envy and spite and malicewere the air we breathed , and that you had to confess them again and again like washing your hands . But how to explain this to a part-time second-hand rationalist ? " You can have these rotten places , " said Prissy , her feel/ings also soaring . " I 'm going back to keep Mummy company . While she 's still alive and sinning . " After that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or so it felt , from church to church , in love with God again in each shattering rendezvous . The thought of Diana fit this mood symphonically : she had opened my heart and made a spiritual life possible . I wrote and told her so , and she wrote back to say she was glad she 'd given me that at least , and to be sure to get to Florence . The letter was cooler than I 'd hoped , but my mood promptly exalted it like organ music . " I 'm glad I 've given you that . " Shazam . " I 've given you that . " Blablam . Her face appeared in every fresco , as virgin and mother and angel . Well , that would be a problem . We had been sinners , there was no getting round it . We 'd have to work out something about that . I felt in my heart that God would forgive something so beautiful , but the priest I made the mistake of confessingit to sure as hell did n't . I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affected not to hear sexual sins out of sheer good manners , so I had a false sense of security . By ill chance , I spotted a confessional that said " English spoken " and I plunged in on one of my ungovernable pious surges . " English spoken " probably just meant " How mucha time , how mucha sorry ? That 'll be ten lire . " But no , it seemed to be an American in there to judge from the glasses . Ouch . Purity , the Blessed Mother , The Book . Too late to get out . He listened silently , while I broke the rules and said it was really love this time ( fancy telling that to an American ! ) and that in my heart I did n't feel guilty and all the stuff Clarence Darrow would have said on my behalf . When he finally spoke it was in a quiet , educated voice ( probably some damn Bible student ) and he spared me hellfire and the Blessed Virgin and went straight to the point . " Do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . "  | " Well , I 'm afraid I ca n't give you absolution until you make up your mind . " We paused as if I could do this on the spot . " Do you want to try to stop ? " he asked helpfully . " Yes and no . " " Of course . That 's right . But I 'm afraid I ca n't give you a yes and no ' absolution , can I ? " As one tourist to another he was more expansive than I 'd bargained for . " Cruel as it sounds , you will simply have to choose between your love of Christ and your love of this girl . You must also decide whether your love of this girl is as pure as you think it is , and whether it will remain so after you cut yourself off from Christ and His sacraments . The greatest human loves are indeed beautiful , a gift from God , but the worm is usually in them from the start . " I peered in at the pale face , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " And you must ask yourself if you 're acting in the girl 's best interests even now . Consider what happens if your love weakens for even a moment , say a year from now . And then one day you walk into a beautiful church such as this one and you find God still waiting , and you say , Now , now I must end it . ' " By George , he was dramatizing . His neutral scholar 's voice had even taken a slight Irish turn . Had he once been in such a situation himself ? " You 'll say , Now that it is n't quite so difficult , I 'll do it , ' and then where will she be , my friend ? A year older and a year wiser . " Ah , he 'd only heard about it . They must get a lot of soap operas in the seminary . And novels about nurses . " I 'll think it over , " I said stiffly . " And I 'll pray for your soul , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . St. Peter 's seems for a moment cold and hostile , an Oriental bazaar full of gewgaws for the Big Potentate upstairs . Diana is small and alive and not some big slab of gold offered to the Grand Vizier and his eunuchs . I will put my faith in her , and trust God 's famous mercy . A spark of rebellion , eh ? Just part of my **25;5757;TOOLONG . While I 'm shaking one fist , the other is calculating . In twenty years Diana will be fat and living in Capri , or skinny and living in Venice , and God will still be here . I do n't know what to think . There must be some way to bring all this beauty together . Naturally , I wrote this in full to Diana , and she answered , " I 'm not your conscience , darling , and I 'm not your mother . Why do n't you and Father Goodbody decide my fate between you ? " Oh God , this was going too fast . I was not being a person of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absolution . I was losing in both worlds ; I was twenty years old and sinking . Meanwhile , Prissy has taken to sitting on the Via Veneto with my mother , looking at the movie stars and wallowing in superficiality . " Come out of the morgue , Pen , and join the land of the living . Is n't that some gorgeous hunk of Spam ? " she says of some passing lizard in dark glasses . Her vengeancelicks me like a whip . " This is the real Rome , Pen . It 's all there is . " My mother smiles appealingly through the sacrilege . It 's so nice to have you with us again , Pen . I do the churches once more and they tear at my guts . God ca n't see you today . He has a perfectly splitting headache . You seem to have offended Him in some way . Although I walk from front to back , I seem to be outside . Doors are closed on me . They wo n't let me in my own home . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad Catholic or no , and she answers , " Please do n't do that . I still love you , dearest , but I refuse to be somebody 's crisis of conscience . You know , I loved another Catholic once not a pale priest with glasses ? and it 's just too exhausting . So why do n't we forget each other for now , and you make your confessions and enjoy your Rome ( and I 'm so glad you enjoy it ) and we 'll see if there 's anything left to talk about in the autumn . " The postscript , written later to judge from the ink , said , " Believe it or not , I admire your great cruel Church , and I even oncep217thought of joining it . So I 'll respect your decision whatever it is . But do n't ask me to sit still on my rack while you make it . Actually , I 'm having a rather super summer myself . " Still no tears . Cry , damn you . And how dare you ask me to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pray and curse and love my churches and my love . Looking back , I believe that either decision would have been virtuous . The only sin was the one in the middle . So Chatworth steers straight for that . " I 'm glad you love Rome so much , " says my mother . " Your father and I had some wonderful times here . " Her heart reaches out to me , and I 'm old enough to know it , but I feel nothing . Later , when she 's truly old and impregnable , I would do anything for her . But she does n't want anything now . As the Good Book says , you only get one shot at these things . " I was sick and you visited me not . " That summer when her wound reopened was the summer she needed me , but I had other fish to fry . I had a great big broken heart of my own . Well  --  Prissy was n't much better . In her fury at being here at all , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ priests and nuns in the streets , and her mockery became gross and provincial , as if she 'd never had a day 's instruction . " A Church of the dagos , by the dagos , and for the dagos , " she 'd say , presumably to madden Mother . But Mum did n't seem to care so long as she had company . And Prissy at least provided that , day after long day . Naturally Prissy is now back in the Church as part of her lifelong retreat from life , but that 's strictly between her and Daddy . It 's no affair of mine . When I ask her about that summer , she is slyly reticent in the family manner . " I suppose I was awful , I generally was . But you were pious enough for two . And you did go on about the art work . You ! Art work ! " she laughs . She is right . I took the super soul that Diana had given me and forged it into a hammer with which to smash her skull. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect on Catholics . They 're never the same . " Did she say that , or do I read it in her dark eyes as the train pulls eternally out of Oxford ? Anyway , I Jenkinsed Italy like mad and was an aesthete to the fingertips as we rolled through Tuscany and Umbria . Only , my real art remained life itself , whether in the green terraced hills , shaped for the sacrament of wine , or in the churches where a piece of bread sat shrined in gold . I remember a luminous ardor as I stared at those hills , my heart fairly bursting from my chest  --  but it 's better to put this down to animal spirits than to think it meant anything . Otherwise the betrayal would be too frightful . In Assisi , my religious glands slopped over , and my heart hopped across the cobblestones with St. Francis and quiveredto the simplicities of Giotto , before art got so damn smart . Surely , I thought , art was worship , nothing more nor less ; otherwise it was idolatry . Maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ art was precisely the decadence she admired so much about Europe and which made her a small glass figure , a perfect reproduction of a miniature . But I had found life itself , right here in this old Church , fresh and eternal . I love it when I 'm pompous . Tararaboomdyay . If I had found it , why did n't I keep it ? The Dianas of this world still totter to their museums . But the boy mystic has not been heard from since . Sincerity is no excuse . Ignore those throbbing wattles . What I was really doing was covering up my aesthetic deficiencieswith top-notch super-soul tactics . It was the perfect Jenkins approach to catching up on the art world . I had something even Diana would never have : an instinct for the whole truth . Which is a terrific thing to have if you do n't know anything in particular and are too lazy to learn . By the time we reached Florence , I was getting quite severe with poor absent Diana . She had insisted too much on this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was nothing but Beauty . It did n't have the rich , profligate heart of Rome orp219the purity of Assisi but was slick and heartless and ready for Ronald Firbank . Diana was paying dear for dominating me and making me over in her image . To ward her off , I would even adopt the peasant rags of my mother . I was closer to God that way . The gutter rat knows a lot of ways to beat you . At that , the Uffizi almost did me in . The religious paintingswere so gorgeous that I had to remind myself repeatedly that they were just a convention : this was cash art now , commissioned by sleek patrons in the wool trade , and not the fresh outpourings of some unspoiled heart . Sentimentality is my most repulsive feature , and as my ratings show , I 've made a bundle from it . If this were some puling twenty-year-old we were considering , we might forgivehim . But , unfortunately , it is vintage Chatworth . I can still do it . My voice sobs at famines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ulster and Bangladesh and Grandma Moses . In that mood , I have even threatened to destroy these tapes , for the lying trash they are . But I have to keep the tapes in order that the real Chatworth , who is a pretty good egg , may live and flourish . If I could n't do this dirty little thing , his mind would crack . That is why one preserves tapes . After a week in Florence , I found that Diana 's aspect had changed quite drastically in my mind . She had withered and become old ; she was my art teacher now , my crone . I almost dreaded seeing her again . Yet I could n't let her smug prophecyabout the summer come true . Again and again I took her picture from my wallet : she was as young as ever and lovely and not trying to dominate me in the least , merely to pass on her own joy . Her only crime , like my father 's , was wantingme to be first-rate . Hah ! We 'd see about that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old Catholic city under the skin , Rome in English clothes , a suave hybrid like myself . It was mine as much as anyone 's to claim if I wanted it . There was no need for games . I postponed Diana a few days and plunged into Catholic activities , on thep220grounds that I was praying to make a decision about her . The chaplaincy was an outpost of " my people , " where we flung our defiant credos at the sky . The Reformation had n't beaten us ; the Church of England had come and gone , and rationalismhad reasoned its skinny self to death , and here we were fresh as a May morning bellowing the same songs ( I assumed they were the same ) as the monks who built the place . I had n't looked too closely at my fellow " people " yet . If I had , their pale good sense might have shaken me some . But Chatworth with a new image is like a blind man . My people could have been stuffed and mounted for all I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this state . Unbelievers will never understand this  --  how a lifetime of holy exultation can make chastity a pleasure . Under the sly urging of Oxford , with its hundred atmospheres and voices , I even gave some thought to a celibate vocation . It would certainly be up to Diana 's standards of first-rateness . And besides , this was no world to bring Chatworths into . My father could barely stand the sight of his world , and it was getting worse . I was here to close the shop and put out the lights . I am driven to thinking beautiful thoughts in churches , which makes them particularly dangerous . A vocation to intermittent chastity can be a public nuisance , and after about a week , I got a note from Diana saying , " Well ? " I had no particular plans for her at present . My prayers for a decision had not been answered , for the good reason that I did n't want a decision . I was having too much fun praying for one . " I told you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ met at last in some damn cafe after pub closing . " Summer term is basicallyunfair . It 's like the Riviera . Or shipboard . Love affairs really do n't count . One has the most awful hangover . " " It 's not that , " I said , stung . It was I who had cried on the train platform four months ago , if only to get her to cry.  |p221Leaving  her now made me look like a perfect fool . " It 's something else . " " Yes , it usually is . " " No , it 's what I wrote you about . God and all that . " Feeble . She looked annoyed . " Yes , well , if it really is that , ' and that ' means more to you than my love , then I can only honor you as a spiritual giant and beseech you to get out of my life immediately . " My glass miniature sounded tougher than I remembered . But they came . Tears at last . A little something for the sadist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment ? Because of the tears , of course . I loved her suddenly as much as ever , and there was a happy flooding of my own heart at the thought of my rottenness . I could n't very well let her cry alone . " Make believe we 're drunk , " I mutter . Her face is against mine , drenching it and being drenched right back . She hiccoughsand giggles . " My dear , sweet , spiritual giant , " she whispers . There is something vulgar and wanton about her , as if wine were dripping down her chin . Doll Tearsheet . She knows who 's on the side of life around here . A cracked chapel bell goes off in the distance and an old abbot swears for the thousandth time he 's going to fix it . I 'm hers , for the time being.  |p222Mother  just phoned to congratulate me on my MBE . " I never know where you are , " she said , making two of us , " until I read the papers . " I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the information . " Of course , " she went on , " you know that your father was offered a KBE for his work in World War II , but he refused it . He said it was n't his style  --  did n't match his tie or something of the sort . You know how he was . " Quite . Chatworth RC should be good enough if you must have letters after your name . Rum Protestant practice , to make up for not having saints , I suppose . . . . But does Mother know that she 's making things worse ? A KBE is something worth turning down : it 's built to the scale of a gentleman . An MBE is something you find in a cereal package . Look  --  is there anywhere I can dispose of this thing ? NBC , BBC , help me . Meanwhile , let it be said that Mother lives triumphantly by herself in London now , while the rest of us beat our heads against her facade . And Chatworth RC ,  |p223MBE  , faces life , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her digs on a misty October night in 1949 . These battles are not so easy to win , whatever St. Augustinetells you . But for a time that night it did all seem to flow together  --  the pent-up juice of our summers , Art and God , Germany and Italy , our own little axis . We dined off each other as if what each had learned was exactly what the other needed . Diana wanted Rome to warm up her Siegfried and her Lorelei ; and I needed the Black Forest to blow a cold clean wind through my churches , rattling my monsignors . Done and done . We said it with our bodies and our minds and we wrote it on the windowpane , yes yes yes , si and ja " Wan na become a Catholic ? " I drawled . " If you promise it wo n't be too much like school . " " I 'll do my best . " She had changed . There was a wild dirty grin that had n't been there before , like a Bavarian barmaid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she talked dirty for the first time . Super summer indeed : she must have spent it with the boiler crew of the Bremerhaven . However , that was just for sex . Afterwards , she was as demure as ever , the only woman I 've ever known who could look as modest in her nakedness as a little girl dressed to the chin . " I realized when I got your letters  --  and I know there 's no way of saying this that wo n't annoy you ; forgive me , dearest  --  that you were much younger than I had thought . " I am annoyed , of course . Embarrassed to be found out . Relieved to be found out . " I mean you 're so incredibly poised in person , but your letters were so adolescently earnest , the way Americans are supposed to be . Now I am annoying you , are n't I ? " " Mother told me never to be serious around English people . I wo n't make that mistake again . " " I mean , showing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rooms . Asking my advice . Next year all the furniture will be rearranged , I daresay . " There was the bitterness again , coming and going like a radio wave band . I had obviously disappointed her terribly . Even my handwriting was too childish for a great man . " Why did n't you just give me up ? " I asked . " And put me back in my cradle . " " Believe me , I thought of it . " She was rocking my head gently , as if to say , do n't take this too seriously , it just has to be said . " But I decided I 'd been approaching you all wrong . I 'm quite young myself , really , and I 'd been looking for a hero . Was n't that silly of me ? " I believe I groaned . Surely I was just the thing for someone looking for a hero ? " So I read your letters again and decided to treat you just like the other men I 've known . You 're still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and patted . What pagan nonsense was this ? I was tired now , and fretful . " Was there someone in Germany ? " I croaked . " None of your business , I 'm afraid . " She stood up , and even her bottom had a knowing sway that I had n't seen before . " I should n't have proposed myself as a China doll . We were both very silly . " Old Nanny Oxford took a hand at this point . Diana had to dress fast and get back to her college ; and I had to explain her to my new landlady . The walls of the kindergarten were closing around us once more . " I 'm sorry I disappointed you , " I said , as she ducked for the door . " It 's all right . I 'll get over it . " She gave me a broad , coarse kiss and said , " I must dash . " I was the one who wanted to dash , but I had to sit there on my tousled bed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with all the wisdom of St. Thomas Aquinas and Dr. Watson combined , how my pompous letters had broken the heart of a child . I pictured her crying for days ( all my womenp225cry behind my back ) before reaching desolately for some skiing instructor , and learning to smirk and curse in flawless German . She had been too delicate to last , I guess  --  but why did I have to be the one to spoil it ? Chatworth had corrupted the most perfect thing he would ever meet , by dint of sheer mediocrity . The same damp little self-importance that had made a fool of him at St. Boniface and points east had done it again . But a cad has no business feeling sheepish . If I was such a destructive force , why did I seem so small to myself now ? Face it . Because I had made a fool of myself with those letters , and the overeducated slut had witnessed it . An ego regrouping itself is a horrible thing to see . What had I done that was so wrong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And what had she done ? My body was sore from our lovemaking , and hanging from it , my soul . I was appalled and terrified by certain initiatives she had taken with her silver tongue . They could keep their stinking maturityover here . Homesick for God knows where , I fell on my knees and prayed . Diana was not a bad girl . I had made her think I had wanted lust ; I had wanted lust . The evil was in me , no mistake . I prayed for her to reclaim her naked modesty . I would help her with my own sheer will power . In my current whacked-out condition , this did not seem impossible . I slept in that position , my tail toward heaven for the angels to mock . Time , of course , heals these things at comical speed when you 're twenty , and in a couple of days my dreams dripped sweetness and I was ready for more . I went to Sunday Mass , the worst possible place in my condition . With a slight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The bell at the consecration is like a fire alarm . The word is made flesh  --  no , no , go back . Be a word again . Desperately I call for help but Beelzebub answers the phone and breathes into it heavily.  |p226I  rushed for the fresh air , bowling over ghostly communicants , and raced for Diana 's college in a trance . I was in hell and she was the fire exit . By chance , this was one of the magic hours when women were allowed to receive men in their rooms , and I burst into Diana 's bower with all its books and its prints and I kissed her savagely and said , " We 've got to stop doing this . " No , I could n't have been that silly , even then . I mean , I did n't kiss her savagely , I 'm sure , but more like a football coach . Then I held her at arm 's length with a sad smile , and saw that she was blazing . " What do you mean we ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Had I aroused her somehow ? " Suppose I like doing this ? " she said . " Suppose I say we 've got to continue ? " Her brown hair swung like a bell . " Am I allowed even one vote in this ? " " I do n't know what to say . Do as you like . " She reached for one of her rare cigarettes and sucked it in half . " Why did I have to find another Catholic ? You 're all quite mad . " She drew again and the cigarette was gone , or so it seems . " All right , " she said , " we wo n't do this . I can live without it . In fact , if you 're going to call this this , ' I 'm not even sure I want to do it . But please stop torturing me . " Again my notes are confused . I had been sent on a grownup 's errand and felt I should try to talk like one . So I murmured , incredibly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head again . " You 're really too much for me , Pen . That 's the way you propose to a shopgirl who wants an abortion . Please just go away now and leave me alone . " Note how the masterful techniques I 've acquired over the years come to a head in this scene . Grotesquely , I am riven by lust at her anger . Her body is electric . And one powerful emotion is much like another . The Devil is working on his masterpiece , the ultimate Chatworth fiasco , clearly Old Nick 's life dream , but Dianap227must sense this , because she screams , " Just get out ! " and I jerk my way through the door like a silent-screen comedian . Chatworth can take it . I decide to sublimate with greatness . Theater , politics , wherever a great man is needed . But what 's this ? It does n't seem as easy as it did last year . My loss of status in Diana 's eyes has sapped my strength . The English twits that I once despised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charming . Last year , as a vain child , I handled them with ease ; but as an embryonic adult , I pad the streets like a dwarf , peering up at everybody . One night I sign on to speak at the Oxford Union and find my palms sweating before I reach my seat : the level of wit is intolerably high , with all those future prime ministers Father had told me about blasting from the hip ; but that is n't the problem . It suddenly comes to me in this palatial beer garden that I do n't have a style anymore . As I wait my turn , I ca n't find a voice to go with my jokes . American or English , fast or slow , fat man or thin  --  I ca n't place myself in any category at all . What sort of height am I , for instance ? I mean , deep down ? On all sides , the English have sharp , fixed faces like charactersin old political cartoons , and voices to match . I have a face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have washed away the blueprint by painting over it too often . Mercifully , the joint empties , as if everyone is moved by my embarrassment , and I have no one left to please but the last glassy-eyed patrons and a few talent scouts looking for yet more prime ministers and lords of the woolsack in the night . My styleless voice bounces off the empty rows and comes back to me ; and I choke with terror . It is the most godawful sound I have ever heard . This is not the no-voice I 'd been hearing in my head ; rather , it is every voice I 've ever encountered : Philadelphia and Jersey Irish and county English and East End whore , like a thousand mimics screaming into onep228tube . Since I am too weak to play tricks , I assume this is my real voice at last , crawling splayfooted from its cave . I must hide it somehow . I ca n't expose other people to this . I hurry on and somebody out there groans . I understand perfectly , sir . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to feel foreign , but I have never felt inhuman before , trapped like this in an animal language all my own , too loathsome for civilized company . Even my few jokes sound evil and insincere like jokes in hell . Clearly the owner of this voice has never really been amused by anything . I left the building in silence , avoiding people like a leper and lurching home by back roads with my cloak over my face . Perhaps Snead was born that night , called forth by the sound of his own voice . Perhaps all my people were . Of course , I 've since learned that many of us have the same reaction the first time we hear ourselves speak and it 's nothing to fuss about ; but few of us can have more than one level of deceit to get used to ; I had a symphony that night . I had n't realized how much I had lived by voices and how much I had counted on my own to be perfect , and not this guttersnipe amalgam . Shattered , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prayed to have my sores blessed and my voice forgiven . I could n't even confess to anyone , because no priest spoke my language . I could only point to my throat and grunt , " Here , here 's my sin . " The next day I got a note from Diana saying she could n't get me out of her system , which almost started me off again . " Welcome to Cancer City , my good woman , " said the great false voice , Muldoon and Daddy down in the sewer together . " Everything 's up to date here , as the song says . " Yes , I would just do voices from now on , more and worse ones ; I 'd get my own transmission set and spew them over the landscapelike king 's vomit . If all else failed , I 'd write novels . But then , the Lord heard my prayer and sent a messenger in the form of a solemn , familiar-looking fellow with a goldp229mustache , who stood at the foot of my stairs and spoke as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We were wondering if you 'd like to speak for us . " I stared down at him as he stumbled eternally toward me , tripping on each stair , over and over . " I heard you the other night and you were really quite good , you know . At any rate , the Tories did n't much like it . " Tories ? Had I attacked the Tories ? My jokes were so garbled , they might have attacked anybody . Hoskins stood panting at my level . " May I come in a moment ? Yes , we need good strong speakers like you . And we need funny speakers like you . Not facetious ones , mind you  --  Lord spare us any more lightweights . There was real honest-to-God irony in your speech , and I suspect delicate pause real feeling , too . " I fumbled with my little silver teapot . I had never known what to do with it . Being totally beyond speech , I threw him a strong-looking nod . " You 'll excuse my asking , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Strong-looking headshake . I was n't going to add Canada to my portfolio . " Spent time in the States , " I muttered . " Ah , that 's it . That 's why your humor has so much more force than ours . " He fingered his mustache . " God , how I loathe whimsy . " I was still fumbling with my teapot when he left . Between clenched gums , I 'd agreed to think it over . But he could n't fool me . Even for flaying the Tories my voice was a fake  --  a library of fakes , in fact . Every pose , every shrill act of faith had stuck there , until it was my own portrait of Dorian Gray . I could n't say " hello " without filling the air with lies and exposing myself beyond repair . And yet , and yet . Liked it , did he ? Not right away , I swear to God . I did n't come round to my voice without a struggle , but attempted to talk for a while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ round demanding a showdown , she thought I 'd hurt my jaw.  | " Have you had a tooth pulled , or what ? " I had n't meant it to be that neutral . " I guess I do n't like my voice much , " I said apologetically . " Pen , you 're quite mad , " Diana laughed . " So I suppose you 've decided to trade it in for a new one , like a good American . Do you mind telling me what 's wrong with it ? Personally , I think it 's one of the few unquestionably nice things about you . In fact , it 's probably the principal reason I let you take me home that ill-fated night . " You 'll note that her style with me is harsh now , almost contemptuous . She has come here because she ca n't help it , but that is all . There is no respect left , no admiration . This , as a French aphorist might say , is not unflattering . But the cheap crack about Americans showed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ runs through some English people like anti-Semitism , and even after prodigious displays of tolerance , it squeaks out like a fart . So  --  perhaps I had overrated her last year ; out of mutual misunderstanding , we had created a god and goddess . Which , mon ami , is why people travel , no ? Where did that leave us ? No question of love , of course . There was nothing left to love . I could see ugly hints of intelligence in her mouth , defacing the old loveliness . Her thoughts were not angelic illuminations , but just those of a smart little skirt going about her business . We were , in fact , two clever people on the make , among hundreds of such at Oxford . Well ? She was n't really that either , but perhaps she thought it was what I wanted . Or all I deserved . Who knows ? I do know that she said she loved my voice , and started me on the awkward road to loving it myself . It so happened that she knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was standing there listening to the monster again , gagging over it like a kid with his first whiskey , trying , trying to like it . It was still horrible , but perhaps not quite as horrible as before . Imagine David Frost and Norman Mailer put to/gether , and you still have n't got it . " Lovely and original and sexy , " purred my temptress , Diana . " How did such a dreadfulman acquire such a divine instrument ? " Hold my hand , dearest . I can never make it without your help . " Sexy , intelligent . " Yes , yes . She means it ; she is not like Millicent . I am green , I can tell , and trembling . The little prig at St. Boniface is in there . I can hear him distinctly , and behind him the other little prig who wants to fight the Germanssingle-handed , and laid on top are all the swaggering tough guys and smoothies of my lying heart  --  and they are still in there , by the way . Because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you all know and love , the one that 's talking now . Monty Chatworth , your host for the evening . That 's it . My voice is my confession , Father . It 's all there . What need have I of sins ? That must be why I 'm doing this . Talking it all away . Now what I have to do is join a Trappist monastery and take a vow of silence ... . " Darling , I think George would like to close now , " says Diana . How long have I been here ? Days and days . A lifetime . Twenty minutes ? " You certainly are a glutton for punishmentif you really hate it so much , " she says , echoing O'Connor and the mirror . Echoes and mirrors , my life story . Could even Narcissus have coped with a second interest like that ? " The sheer horror fascinates me , " I say weakly . For I have taken the first faltering steps . Yes , there 's something in there I like . Even Dorian Gray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given time . My love affair with my voice is about to begin . Slowly and blindly . The heart is stealthy , even in matters of autoeroticism . Diana is again my procurer , lasciviously devising a new hero for me out of my dirty old pipes , all else having failed . Amazing woman , destroying and creating . But they all did that in those days . We called them devils and saints quite arbitrarily.  |p232Why  did she do it , in particular ? Because , to get my attention , she had to hold up mirrors . This one arrived in the nick of time , just as her magic had gone . I simply had to love the first girl who loved my voice . The look of intelligence vanished , she had no more need to calculate , and we were once more two grinning lovers in a looking glass shaped like a heart . Note the improvement , the growth in Chatworth . I had loved the gawky Millicent for one vague compliment . Now I demanded precision . State your reasons for loving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , as I talk , no reasons seem good enough . My wastebasket brims over with fan letters and I live alone . My heart can only be fueled by compliments and it has flooded . What can a woman see in me that has n't been seen a times before ? What gem of character remains hidden ? " My kindness , my courage , my English wit in America , my American wit in England . My fucking voice everywhere . " Laboring at thirty , praised out by forty , poor devil . If you start out as God with a woman , it has to be downhill after that . All Diana actually did was encourage my little dash at politics , and even take an interest herself for the first time . Fate had cast me with the Labourites  --  well , that was where my heart really lay anyway , did n't it ? No , seriously . I remembered my relatives ' sighing over their damn west wings , and also how they had made fun of my mother , and all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any wellbalancedperson , left and right both appeal to me enormously . I was not  --  it 's time for a little heartbreak here  --  quite the success I 'd hoped to be at the union . Perhaps I was too sincere for them . I do n't know . Although I was from the first a better than average titter-provoker , the talent scouts somehowknew that I was n't prime minister material , and I could n't rise in the party and get to sit on the platform where the public could memorize me . Politics is not quite the samep233as acting . You ca n't pretend to be a politician any more than you can pretend to have sex appeal . There 's a quality in there deeper than mannerism . Ambition , power  --  I could make the faces , and I knew what to do with my hands , but I could never fool a pro . " But you 're so good at demolition work , " said Hoskins , when I asked him for a major speaking assignment . " And we need people to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't be as bad as it sounds . That 's what they 'd signed me for , and that 's all they 'd signed me for : as an entertainer to beef up the bottom of the lineup and bring in the last-minute vote from the flippant elements . I now believe the power elite of the Labour party would have been hard to crack that year , even for a master . It was a snug little machine long since set in its ways . I assumed that it had already parceled out future cabinet posts and was not looking for any new mouths at the trough . Tough , stagnant men : they were not playing , could not afford to play . Their own grip on English power was not so secure that they could afford to share it with me . I missed this at the time , partly because the whole grim business proceeded so facetiously . These men debating for their lives were obliged to do it with jokes and languor . Little bursts of indignation were OK , and even obligatory for top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ precisely right . The listener was supposed to feel a sober shock at the back of his neck . " That 's right . It 's time somebody said that . The joking 's gone far enough . " Perfect . I learned a lot from those boys ; but I was n't debating for my life , and they knew it . So my patchwork career continued , in a manner indigenousto Oxford . I became a " figure " at the union : part clown , part charmer , and all heart , obviously using the place for my own ends . Fair enough . The politicians had sewn up one corner for themselves , leaving the rest for adventurers , puppy eccentrics , and people who just wanted to establishp234their indifference . Later we would move in a body to the BBC and continue uninterrupted . Or if not us , people just like us . ( The Labour elite barreled over to the Bank of England or someplace , but I 'm sure the machine is still intact . ) A bit of acting , a bit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ puts the juggler on automatic pilot , and voila , a career . It seemed as careless and amateur as in my father 's day but , as I say , most of my generation were playing for blood . Even I , with my private income , knew that my elbow was hitting someone else on the way up . Even when you 're going nowhere , there 's only so much room at the top . That was the counterpoint to the life of the heart , and should be kept in mind . Because it could be powerfully distracting . E.g. , when Diana came back to me , she was deadly serious about Catholicism . " I was , " she said , " impressed against my better judgment by the torment you honestly seemed to be going through . Any religion that caused so much pain must have something to it . " Oh , I do n't know . " So if I 'm going to go on suffering from Catholics , I might as well get the good of it . So please tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a vicious lie , circulated by my memory , that I had ceased caring about the Church just like that . But my ardor was fitful now , as the excitement of speaking at the union battered me in torrents . I summoned my religious feelings for Diana , and sometimes they were real and sometimes they were n't ( they 'd been asked to do so much ) . But whatever they were , they seemed to move Diana almost frighteningly . My God , she 's turning into a saint , I thought . Please do n't . I 'm faking some of this . Keep your sense of proportion , I beg you . The worst of it was , she took absolutely seriously my old paroxysms of celibacy . " I know how hard it is for someone like you , a passionate man in love with life . " Who , me ? " God how I admired you and how I hated you . But I wo n't give you any more trouble . I 'll try to make it as easy as possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever arranged more demure or desolate trysts than our next batch . We went to the Catholic chaplaincy together and had buns with the old fruitcake in charge , and at last the terrible day came and she asked to take instructions . I 'd brought it on myself . There would be no getting her in the sack now . I had hoped after a suitable interval to break down and admit that my love of life had become too great and how about it , huh ? God works with broken reeds  --  enjoys the challenge , in fact . But now , that was out . I must help her . We must fortify each other . You 've done it this time , Chatworth , you and your crazy acting . I swear I tried . I prayed for strength and I guess I got it . At least , the voluptuous memories of our lovemaking began to fade . I almost forgot what her body looked like , though , strangely , I can see it now , dancing in firelight . Maybe it 's somebody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of praying strengthened my faith . In fact , now that faith was such an albatross , I could n't seem to lose it . But the one thing that praying could n't do was keep me from getting bored . Holy women were old hat with me . Diana had been different , because she 'd flattered my undernourishedartistic side . But being loved for my sterling characterwas so stale . Even if it had been true , I 'd have received no pleasure from it . As a rancid lie , it was intolerable . All my virtue amounted to was that I was too vain to back down from a pose of virtue . All I could do to buy time was speak and act and show off  --  like a middle-aged man sublimating a bad marriage . Concerningwhich , yes , that subject was now serenely in the air . Where else could we go ? A virtuous marriage to a holy woman  --  it was too much . I was too young . I had to make my way in the world . What 's that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No , please do n't do that . I ca n't ask you to make the sacrifice . . . . No sacrifice at all , you say ? Pleasedon't.  |p236It  was in this mood that I met Letitia O'Reilly at the chaplaincy , a veteran Catholic with streaming gold hair who understood about God 's mercy to sinners and other tricks of the trade . Which usually means a bad Catholic on the way out , but I did n't stop to ask questions . A double life is the most unbearable memory known to man , and I 'd really rather not dwell on it . What is the least one can say in confession ? Diana was my muse of speaking , of showing off . A little relief on the side would make this arrangement possible . A man has needs . " You old humbug . " Letitia was a laughing bawd and she found my scruples uproarious . " Do n't come the old priest with me , my good man . " She was damned if she was going to be a little relief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Diana today ? Out doing good ? " she said , feathering me with her breasts . When I took Diana to the chaplaincy , Letitia would grin and wink at us , until Diana got quite bothered . " Who is that girl , and what 's the matter with her ? " " Search me . " But even that was n't enough for Letitia . " Introduce me to your friend , " she says one Sunday after Mass . I mumble an introduction like an altar boy and try to tug Diana away . " Oh , you 're the one who 's going to become a Catholic , " says Letitia . " Just as everyone else is leaving . " " Yes , I thought you could stand some new faces , " says Diana pleasantly . Sacred and profane love stare at each other . Everything in Letitia 's face and body says , " We 've done it . Pen and I have done it . " The honesty of women will be the death of me . All my games , my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Letitia does n't have to say any more . Diana nods , smiles at her . " What about her ? " Diana asks me calmly afterwards . Chatworth gestures . He ca n't field them all.  | " How funny . How very funny , " she says . " You know you really are a dangerous child . " I pause . There is still time for a desperate avowal and a howl for mercy . But do I still want her ? I have been offered a way out . " You 're too good for me Diana , " I mutter . " Oh , that 's too rich . Too priceless . " We are either walking or drinking tea or both . I do n't want her , but I still want her good opinion . " You 've got the Church now , " I say . " Perhaps you do n't need me anymore . " " Oh that . Now that you mention it , I do n't suppose I shall ever go near a bloody church again , as long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think , oh great , then we can go back to where we were . A man is not responsible for his reflexes . She is small and shrunken from trying to please me , and the least I can do is let her . " Please , take your hand off my arm , " she says , " and keep it off . I do n't want to see you again and I mean it . " She walks away in the flat winter light . Her back screams , " All I wanted was you , on any terms you liked . Was n't that silly of me ? " I hitch my duffel coat around me . I have turned a soul away from my beloved Church . I am alone in a silent street . I did n't mean it , oh Lord . I did n't mean anything.  |p238Now  I 'd like to be declared a grand marshal of Texas , just to balance things . I also want my golden-gun award , and a tiny star to protect my heart from silver bullets . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But I 'm learning to live with my MBE , whatever Mother says . Devalued though it may be , it matches my Jenkins tie very nicely . And my Paisley shawl . As Diana loped away carrying her load of adulthood on each shoulder , a devalued Chatworth faced a devalued Oxford , and found it was just his meat . This illusion is common to second-year men , and is never seen again . Thanks to Diana 's lessons , I had become the perfect undergraduate . And , as a moral imbecile , I was free as a loon . I did n't face it right off , but threshed around the old way , confessing and moving heaven for guidance . My speaking and acting took on a new depth . This man has suffered . I did n't need my muse anymore now that my feet were on the ledge . My moral collapse coincided with an incandescent burst of talent . But I sensed that this depended on being " serious " in somep239way . And religion was still my other dimension , my secret @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jokes . So I still went through the motions of feeling guilty about sleeping with Letitia , to her amused irritation . " Come off it , Pen . You know we were both sold a bill of goods about all that . " Well , it was bad enough going back to Tish at all after a hurry-up bout of remorse ; but to lose another Catholic soul as well was more than my overloaded conscience could bear . So I said , " I happen to believe it , damn it . " " Pooey , it 's just that you Americans do n't know what to do with yourselves when you 're not feeling guilty . You think you must be wasting your time . I 'll bet your first little words were , Father , I picked my nose three times and I kinda enjoyed it . ' " " I never heard a sentence that began you Americans ' that was either funny or even normally intelligent . " " But it 's true . You people should never have been told about the Catholic Church @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Look , Pen , why do you suppose they print the dirty parts in Latin ? So that people wo n't worry about them , that 's why . And then some officious Yank comes along and says , Hey , Padre , what 's all this masturbatio and fornicatiostuff , huh ? Does it endanger my immortal soul or what 's the story on that ? ' " " And spare me American accents done by the English . You 're just trying to excuse your own wantonness by calling it Old World . " " As you wish , " she said , stroking me . " As you wish . " I have done my duty by my beliefs , by stating them , and I have paid my dues to seriousness . On the other hand , I 'm not about to talk any more girls out of my bed . So I set to with a vengeance , reflecting as I pump that poor Diana had worn herself out being a saint for me and a sinner for me , but that Tish will never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in memory at least , the spirit of sheer bawdiness , take it or leave it.  |p240I  shall , in fact , leave these girls with infinite regret , because no one will look like that again , although I 've seen a thousandjust like them . Whatever has happened to my inner works has made romantic love all but impossible from now on . Tish was the transition point . " Love ? " she said once . " What 's that ? A rumor spread by some pansy troubadours . " She refuses flatly to stop seeing other men , ca n't even see the point of the request . " What earthly difference does it make ? " I forget . We spent a blowsy boozy summer term , a parody of last year 's Jamesian delights , and signed up for a student tour of Denmark , where Tish seemed immediately restless without the mild constraints of Oxford . On our second night in Copenhagen she got roaring drunk and tried to have sex with me in a cafe . " Come on , no one can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She must do something bad tonight . As I fought for my honor under the tablecloth , she turned and commencedsoul-kissing another student . Too bloody much . I 'd tell her I was leaving . " Well , good for you , " she said between sucks . " You 'll find a Bible in your room . " Sometime around Denmark 's early dawn she turned up in my room drunk and hysterical . " Have you got anything to drink , Pen ? God , I wish I was dead . " " Where have you been ? " " None of your fucking business , you puritan prig . I 'll go where I like . And with whom I like . " She was suddenly a trull at the Abbey Theatre flinging her shawl this way and that . " Sure you will . That 's great . " She suddenly sagged against me . " Oh Pen , I 'm so worthless . Have you got anything to drink ? " I have a little schnapps and she pours it over her chin and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They tried to make me good , you know , but I outfoxed them . Ah hah ! " She sagged again . " Now I 'm frightened . I ca n't seem to control myself . The brakes are gone . Down and down and whoosh , we go . Help me , Pen . You 're good , are n't you ? "  | " Yeah , I 'm a bloody marvel . Come to bed now . " " Down and down and whoosh ! " She hiccoughed a couple of laughs as I guided her to my scrawny hostel mattress . She tried politely to make love on the way down but collapsed in a damp heap and began to snore and cry simultaneously . " My God . Oh , my God , " she said a few times . I made myself some coffee and felt like a death's-head as I gazed out the window . Did I have another reform case on my hands ? Would Scout-Commander Chatworth have to lead another fallen sister to daylight ? I 'm afraid it looked like it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and piss , until her very soul was a puddle . I know it sounds crazy , but I 've never had such a sense of liquid about anybody . But when she finally awoke , she was hung over but organized . " I 'm sorry about last night . You seemed embar-rassed . " " I did ? And you remember it ? " " Oh yes , oh yes . I remember everything . Always . " " I guess we 'd better take it easy today , huh ? Make like tourists , and all that . " " Are you joking ? Right now I ca n't wait to get my jowls round some more of that lovely beer . " " You mean after last night ? " " Yes . And not one minute before . " She sat up on the mattress with a jerk and seemed to catch her head with her hands before it flew off . " Look Pen , if you do n't like last night I shall try not to bother you again . But do n't preach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rub your chin . Or anything at all . Last night is the price I pay for the way I live , and I pay it with my eyes open . " " But is n't it going to get worse ? " " So they tell me . " " A thousand headaches and a painful death and all that ? " " I would n't be a bit surprised . " Her cup beat a tattoo on the saucer . " If your good moments are as good as my good moments , it 's worth it . As for you ... " Quite . It would n't be worth it for my good moments . Itp242strikes me that Diana would understand Tish infinitely better than I do . People over here , even ones named O'Reilly , seem to take the measure of life early on and decide precisely what 's best for them . They choose between sensuality and thought as one might between cricket and rowing , math and languages . The country is one big aptitude test , administered by a fag tailor . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entirely the wrong build for it . Have you considered God , sir ? " There is no good or bad about it : so-and-so 's a lecher  --  that 's his thing . His friend Charles is a monk . Chatworth is an American . He will never take the measure of life because he refuses to admit it has limits . He will keep his options open . He has no face yet ( in the sense that the English do ) because a face would limit him . He can never have a good time ( in the sense that Tish does ) but he can never give up hope either . He is laughable , but he keeps coming at you . In the wearying Scandinavian daylight , I felt again the rigorous puritan emptiness that had settled in me in my teens . Travel can play these tricks with time . These are definitelyViking thoughts as opposed to Latin ones : I am a martyr to geography . Tish can already see to the end of her life and has counted costs ; this entitles her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , finite . I am damned if I am going to see to the end of my life . I can still be anybody I want to . I will choose a face when the time comes . " Do n't look so stern , Pen . I 'm a fearful poseur , like all the O'Reillys . This week I 'm doing the Fallen Woman . " As she shakily applied her lipstick , she said , " Well , at any rate , I wo n't commit suicide . Oddly enough , that 's one teachingof Mother Church I accept with all my heart . " So much for romantic love . Tish had decided it cramped her style and slowed her libido to a crawl . And she drained it out of me . For the rest of the tour , I fed her beer and let her sleep where she might . I got no more and no less of her than if I 'd locked her in her room . All right , it was n't that easy . Envy is hard to kick , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But once envy is kicked it stays kicked . And since if you ca n't envy you ca n't love , I was free in one more way . I entered the world of indiscriminate sex where there are no men and women , just heads and tails alternating . And I can still be found bobbing about out there with the gang . With so much freedom , I will never get a face now . As I look in the last of my mirrors , I see I 've left it far too late . Still , the public seems to like what they see . Perhaps it 's themselves . Back to Oxford for my third and last year . Suddenly the signs were up everywhere : " The party 's over , " " All aboard the Titanic . " Funny I had n't noticed them before . The air now crackled with talk of careers , and I guessed I 'd better talk careers too , just to keep in the swim . But my heart was n't in it . I still wanted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here . English careers were more like wallingyourself up in a monastery . The starting pay in all walks of life seemed downright ludicrous , but my friends were willing to hang in and wait forever . The timid buggers . Why did n't they go to Australia or somewhere ? Even last year 's lords were scrambling for crumbs , like sparrows . Pah ! Me Chatworth ! " I suppose you 'll want some sort of degree ? " asked my tutor , Mr. Short . " I mean any sort at all ? " " I guess so , " I said . " Well you 're not going to get one at this rate . And I do mean , any sort . " Ah well , that sounded quite distinguished in its way  --  the kind of thing great men tell you after dinner . Went down without a degree , egad , belch . Mr. Short had chosen the ever-popular insouciant route through Oxford , which plays hell with the lower spine , and he had shown no interest in me at all up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sofa with a bottle of beer balanced on his chest , I realized that even he must have his anxieties inp244this tense little country . He had also , as you will see , spent five years in the merchant navy , which had destroyed his mind and prepared him for Paisley . " Think , if you will , of England as a madly overcrowded refugee ship that is sinking ever so slowly in the North Atlantic . Not one of my best metaphors , but if you 're not going to get a degree , what does it matter ? It is imperative on this ship that everyone keep calm , and that nobody raise his voice . In the circumstances , passengers like me can be quite good value . Our apparent laziness is soothing , and our understated humor is just the thing for a sinking ship . We also do our little bit and do n't take up much space . But passengers like you , " he opened an eye and cocked a finger , " are another matter . Passengers who do n't have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave at will , and who flaunt their wealth in the ship 's bar . " He did n't sound angry : he talked exactly the same way about Cromwell and the rise of the middle class . It was his Method , and I did n't take it to heart . " You see , most of the chaps here had to claw their way on board  --  well , perhaps this metaphor has gone as far as it will go . It does n't pay to buy cheap . Anyhow , they had to struggle to get here , and a degree is a matter of life and death to them . So you can perhaps see that such a figure as yourself , however dashing , might be a pestilence to certain nostrils . " If he kept on talking , I might not have to read my meager , unresearched essay at all . So I said , " I believe I 've gotten , got , something out of Oxford , Jonathan  --  the sort of thing my father got , and wanted me to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Your father , ah yes . You had a father up here . Mine was a grocer in Stepney . That might account for our different perspectives . Now , I suppose we 'd better get on with your essay  --  if you 've brought one this week ? " The essay was so small and bad that it was read and demolished in no time at all . And this seemed to nettle him again , although he retained his bored drawl as before.  | " Perhaps as a vocal member of our Labour party , bringing us valuable insights from abroad , you can see that in your father 's day Oxford was a species of leisure cruise in the Aegean , where one could still pick up scraps of civilization for the mantelpiece ; but that now it , along with England , is crowded and sinking . " Lordy , how that man could talk . But my conscience was n't used to this kind of material . In my obsession with one-on-one sinning , I did n't realize he was telling me roughly the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in crowds or all alone , if your heart is really in it . " I see your point , Jonathan , " I said . " But I 'm here , and I do n't need a degree as badly as I need other things . Maybe even the working guys could use a holiday from the sinking ship instead of three more years of worry and competition . But anyway , all of them already have more culture than I. They 've been through the Aegean before they got here . This is my first time . " What is all this shit about the Aegean ? Why am I talking like him ? " Well , you 've learned a little something about arguing , at least . And specious arguing is better than no arguing at all , I suppose . If it really is the Aegean you 're sailing through and not Mayfair , perhaps your time here has not been entirelyprofitless . " He did n't really want to convert me , just to prove I was wrong . Anti-American resentment took funny forms in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be rich enough to cruise through Oxford ; in fact , failing that , he now acted as if he were cruising through Oxford , with his drawling and his beer bottles . What a parody of the lordly dons my father used to talk about ! Because what it came down to was that this hand-me-down dandy could not afford to have one of his customers fail an exam ! Still , I was sorry for the little tyke , and I decided to do a spot of work . Everybody else was doing it anyway ; it was the only game left . And I 'd tried everything else up here . I knew that the real education is locked away in little coteries andp246societies with funny names and it was much too late to crack those . But I did borrow another chap 's notes and set forth to Jenkins my finals . And just as well I did . Because when I got home for Candlemas or whatever , Prissy said , " You 'd better get a good degree , Pen , because we 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Well , how broke are we , and how the hell did it happen ? " She and my mother sat on the sofa smirking like conspirators , as if something simply wonderful had happened . " If you 'd been paying attention . . . " said Prissy , and laughed . " You did n't really think Daddy was rich , did you ? Rich enough to support you forever ? " " Not forever , " I said , " just long enough to get started . " " Well , consider yourself started now , old bean . Daddy would have . " " What do you mean by that ? " " When he made me his executor , he said , I 'd like Pen to have a really good Oxford , in the old-fashioned sense . Free from care , free to grow . So tell him not to worry . He 's so absentminded these days , he probably does n't know what an estate of this size looks like when the abominable tax man is done with it . ' " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paraphrasing . What he really said is , That twit is so vague he wo n't know what hit him . ' Anyway , he wanted you to have as much as possible in a lump sum , while Mummy and I got ours in dribbles . " So that 's what they were smirking about . Nothing better sums up our family than this Victorian scene . " He told both of you this ? " They nodded happily . " Behind my back ? " " Where else ? " said Prissy . " It was for your own good , " said Mother.  |p247Oh  , I knew that all right . The gallant old fellow had out-virtued me again . And look what he 'd got for it . A burned-out cynic , a rich passenger . " You 've done just the sort of thing he wanted , " rambled Mother . " Speaking at the union , traveling , though I 'll never really understand Denmark . " My eyes , I fancy , bulged furiously . This last act of Daddy 's kindness had added @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the real life of my generation . In fact , with the best will in the world , he 'd always done that , had n't he ? But one could n't get mad at Father now : the family would crash in ruins . " I do n't much like having my life planned for me , " I said . " Well , it wo n't happen anymore , " said Prissy . " We wo n't plan another thing for you , will we Mummy ? " " And do you have to gloat like that ? " " Yes , I do . Nobody ever planned anything for me , Pendrid . Three scrummy years at Oxford without a care . Daddy felt you 'd missed so much because of the war , you poor dear . And now you have the gall to be angry about it . " " I 'm not angry , " I said reflexively , " just penniless . " " Not completely , " squeaked Mother . " Anyway , you must have bags of juicy connections by now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll be in clover . Daddy felt , " I shut my eyes : Oh God-like Daddy , always right , " that you would go further if you relaxed and made friends than if you worried and worked too hard . " " Daddy , " I said , through my tight little mouth , " was undoubtedly right in his day . But he never really came to grips with the postwar world . " " He believed that the facts of power in England were changeless . " My soul tossed in fever . " He seems to have talked an awful lot to you , " I said . " Why did n't he tell these things to me ? " " Just shy , I suppose . He thought a man should discover the world for himself . Women have to be told . "  | " You , " my mother said , rubbing salt gently into the wound , " were constantly on his mind ; you were to be his legacy . " " And he took it for granted we felt the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . " And we do , of course , do n't we ? " Having nothing better to do , I smiled . " Do n't let them see you 're bleeding , " Daddy used to say . Aye , aye , sir . When I returned to Oxford , it was the same grim institutionit had been for the others all along . I was into the real life of my generation at last , clawing and scratching to stay afloat . The little creases around Mr. Short 's eyes subsided . He took entire credit for my sudden burst of application . " You should get something , " he said . " Lord knows what . " He did n't care ; he had never cared . But the juice had gone out of Oxford for me . This last crushing act of paternalism had turned the place hopelessly sour . I 'd been given his Oxford ; but without his income that Oxford disappeared like a magic village . I 've since learned that that was a Golden Age and that Oxford has really become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suicides in my year , but that can happen in a Golden Age . What ate at my liver was that technically I could n't get angry at him . He had done me a kindness in his foggy way . I still had a big fat allowance and could buy drinks for everybody . I could purchase new friends in every bar . But I had dropped a class in my mind . " We did n't want to tell you , " Prissy said before I left home , " but we thought we 'd better before it was too late . " Who the hell are you to have this power ? " I really am sorry , " said Priss . " King for a day . If you ask me , I think Daddy was a bit cracked . " Cracked ? He was power-crazy . He even thought he was my father . " He manipulated both of us , " said Prissy . " But I suppose that 's saints for you . "  |p249For  half a moment I was deflected from my own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Kept me from having smelly communist babies . Rememberthat ? Also , he offered me a jolly good job in the importexportbusiness . Which I refused . And he offered to give me a coming-out season . Which I refused . I fought him , you know  --  for all the good it did me . " Fought him ? By George , that 's just the thing . I 'll do it . But how could I fight him now ? By not being first-rate . By being an unworthy Chatworth . By dropping my pants in church . Believe me , I 've done it all . You ca n't exactly Jenkins Oxford , because Oxford inventedJenkins . The whole system is a web of shortcuts so intricate they constitute an education . Only the greatest of scholars do n't use them . So , although I 'll only say it once and in the secrecy of the confessional , I worked like hell for two terms . ( Did you know , Father , that you are bound to secrecy ? Otherwise , I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good second and received an amused note from Mr. Short . " I do n't think you 're an American at all , " it said . Even Alcatraz must look lovely by sunlight . For the last couple of weeks Oxford looked achingly beautiful and I realized , now that it was too late to help , that I would never be so happy again . Suffer ? Oh yes , I 'd suffered all right . Young Werther never suffered as I did . Despair ? You bet . Reveled in it . Swam in it bare-ass . Walking down the High in May , bursting with angst ; lying under the willows , burbling with sadness . I 'd give my soul to have it back for five minutes.
