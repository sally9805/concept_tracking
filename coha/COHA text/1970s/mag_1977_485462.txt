like sweatshirts and surely do n't need to reduce , cherished my sweatshirt when one - came my way and even wore it occasionally . Why ? Because a few hours each- day I could - choose whether to wear it or not . It was the same with every optional item of clothing , thOugh none was worth prizing in itself ( except the farmers ' straw hats , which ' still seem nifty in retrospect ) . Incarceration nurtures existentialism . Second , you get out of touch while locked up . For Men who pull real . time ( say , two years and up ) without many visits , there 's a danger of losing what we might call their street personality . The I numb personality take 's over . Indeed , this is part of the prescription for long-timers : " Forget about the street and your five ' years 'll go like that . " But then ? will it still be you who hit the street ? I believe very many convicts , even short-termers , , feel they are getting out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convicts objectively . get out of touch with their free life . Their wives throw them over , or at least worry them ( " Joe the Grinder has been in town , " they get joshed , cruelly ) . Their friends drop out of sight , , sometimes copping jointly owned cars . Their job hopes evaporate . These events are common and , the suffering is not subtle . Another unpleasantness of incarceration is the custodial officers , hacks to , you . There are all kinds ; the , overtly and deliberately cruel ones are not preponderant ; in general , hacks are no worse than convicts at the core . But they suffer from an occupational disease . Those who have been on the job a good many years , hearing a non-committal " Yes sir " from inmates ' all that time , have long since given up any attempts they ever made to be sen- , isitive to an inmate 's attitudes . " You know , Davis , we had bun , dreds of those conscientious objectors in here during the war . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are n't sincere , they do n't mean that about conscience . " " Oh , really ? . " 435 Lowell Thieve , from " The Ithantstgleg 61 it Pri , zoner " " Naw . ' Or those that are sincere are crazy . " " Oh , really ? " ? , " Yeah , I mean they 're always going on hunger strikes . Now what 's the point of that ? We just force-feed them . " " Yes sir . " This hack was neither venting spite against COs nor baiting me , he was just chatting . The occasion of the chat illustrates my point as well : he had found me in another inmate 's cell ; I bad explained that the elan ( though not the authorities ) had given me permission to be there because I had no quiet place of my own to study ; I was manifestly studying ; the hack , a kindly sort , did not discipline me  --  but did stay for over an hour of monologue . This extreme indifference to convicts ' attitudes has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better educated and have heard of " modern penology . " A few , having had psychology in college , are resolved to have insight into their charges ( even to the point of composing fanciful personality analyses of inmates they do n't know ) . Do n't take for granted that these.younger hacks are easier to get along with . Whether due to the beginner 's lack of confidence or riot , they are more likely to , stirprise you with rigid insistence on a petty-rule : 436 All-liacks3 young and ' old ; are vic-tims of the same'lack of correctives from below . Inmate grievances rarely reach them and are more rarely taken seriously . And socializing with their is drastically inhibited Py their great arbitrary power over you . THE WORST annoyance of prison , I was told by a prison psychologist I met before I was locked up , would be having to live with the other prisoners . This I did not find . I did time with Lloyd Barenblatt and Paul Rosenkrantz ? friends of mine and like me First Amendment cases and academics ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense political or conscientious . You may not be so fortunate . Von will surely break bread with many a man you would not have expected to see across the table from you . " Let me tell you , " bragged a grim-faced thug at lunch , " when they need somebody really tough to break a strike , they go to the ex-Cons " ? a spontaneous esprit de corps , in which he included us . From this you may visualize prisoners as a regiment of type-cast waterfront scabs with a place left in the ranks for you to fill , and you may worry . Actually it 's not that bad . - Prisoners- are astonishingly-v.arious.  - -  A hillbilly bootlegger is not the same as a Las Vegas gambler ; a car thief is not the same as a stock manipulator . Even men convicted of the same offense are various . It seems that of the many disorders available to a civilized personality , fully as many will lead to federal prison as to a mental hospital . In this hodge-podge , conformity can hardly be demanded . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' odd-ball , sure . Friendly wisecracking expresses it now and then : At the gym " That 's the way , Davis , yoU 've developed the mind , now develop the body . " " Six months of this , for . a principle ? Brrrl " " Send a carrier pigeon to Khrushel-ley to parachute us some machine guns , we 're with you . " But while you look odd , , they 're Mostly already resigned to pulling time in company with others fully as odd , They dO n't of beating the odd-ball into a form more familiar to them : because this the authorities punish with a week or so in the hole . You 'll have to beware , not of systematic bullying from fellow inmates , but of unpredictable outbursts . It is safer to be stigmatized as a Red or a professor , than it is to jostle a stranger in the chow line , Remember that no matter how iriational it would be for him to swing at . you for jostling him , there are probably severahmen in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just such an irrationality , and he may be one of them . If - he swings at ? you , he 'll take a trip to the hole , but so will you . Treat him a little - Warily . In the same way , you will be treated a little warily by ' every wise con . It is said of the con-wise long-timer , " He is a gentleman . He may kill you , - but he wo n't insult you . " This is rhetorical ; in fact he wo n't do either  --  except for that small but appreciable danger ' at any instant that he may , the next instant , become an unwise con. like this  --  or anything ' else . Isolated from clothes , home and other identifying marks , they may prefer to fake a past . " My uncle offered me a place in his architectural firm to learn the business . ? that 's how much - he thought of me . Offered me a house in the suburbs and $10,000 . " If their crime was an inglorious one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they may make up a more adventurous offense or just duck the subject . Their emotional lives may be the subject of maudlin fantasy , the imaginary wife-and-family-waiting being the most popular , rather than the imaginary **41;1750;TOOLONG . Now it is hard to get to know a man who is systematically lying to you ; and as for the untrammeled liars , there is in some sense nothing there to know . Of those prisoners whd do talk frankly , most prefer small talk . They do n't feel like forming frieridships in the temporary and unpleasant prison community . Indeed it 's bad form to act earnest about conversations or anything else within the walls ; it may incur that most scornful prison comment , " He 's found a home . " All in all , however fascinating it is to gab with the inmates , I must add this final item to my list of prison frustrations : Too much of your social life is trivial . FOR ALL these reasons , incarceration is a way of life you wo n't relish . But do n't bother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their purpose at all , quite likely consider that you are szt , pposed to be unhappy  --  unless they are of the " modern " school , in which case quite likely their hands are already full offsetting the old-fashioned school . Each philosophy must allow that prison exists to do something for or to the convicts , but ( I suppose because they seem to negate each other ) neither philosophy is implemented in any consistent Way . The philosophical void is filled by expediency . The prisons ' dominant policy is to muddle through . Examples : Whether or- not it is goad for prisoners to be confined , , or good , for some and not for others , penologists December 3 , 1960 may debate . But it was nottheir'clebates that got me the precious privilege of a month working on- the prison farm , outside the walls . That was dictated by the needs of the farm . If I had had a crippled leg , or if I had had some skill the authorities needed inside the walls , like TV repair ( teaching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , I would have taken no step outside for the greater part of my sentence . Whether or not it is good for a man to be locked up alone all day may also be debatable . The hole is usually a deliberate punishment ( even as such , though , you 'd think they 'd consider the great variation between men in how they react ; and you 'd think they 'd strengthen the hole 's deteriene value by publishing the offenses instead of leaving it to rumor ) . But you may also be locked up just because there 's nothing else convenient to do with you . In my case  --  not at all extraordinary  --  the prison bus to transfer a group of us to our ' assigned institution was n't ready to go for two weeks , which we spent closely confined indeed . Thus concentrated doses of what the judge prescribed are administered without prescription . Similarly with lack of responsibility . A few prisoners have plenty of responsibility , more than enough to please them . Not because it has been judged that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ normal life , nor for any other penological reason ; but because they 're suitable and available to take responsibility for some prison department where the employee in charge feels overburdened . Most glaring is the inconsistency in cutting off the inmate from the street . Some inmates get regular visits from relatives , while others who need just as badly this restorative to their street personalities , and who have families they are longing to see , , ca n't . This is most often because the families just ca n't afford a trip of a hundred miles , or.a thousand , or - whatever . Why ( suggested one veteran of four years ) could n't the government pay transportation expenses for some minimum number of visits to each inmate ? Or if in its wisdom the Bureau of Prisons sees visits as unsalutary , why does n't it forbid them to all inmates ? Again , the Bureau encourages inmates to have their wives or brothers line up post-release jobs for them and may even make parole contingent on having such- a job . But then , since an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough , why does n't the Bureau allow the inmate himself to write letters to prospective employers ? , It is especially the rootless young occasional , thief who suffers from this proscription , ' and he is exactly the criminal whose future conduct-would depend most , I 'd think , on starting a regular job soon after release . In prison , why not give skilled jobs like garage mechanic and steam-shovel operator , not to those who need the least instruction , but to those needing it most ? Loyal noises are uttered about vocational/training , but that 's about all . The selection of men for a job is pretty haphazard . I CA N'T restrain myself from mentioning the most miserable sham of all . It 's the one event most directly aimed at influencing the convict 's behavior after release : the Pre-Release Lecture . The topics are the inevitable ones : readjusting to family and job , , avoiding alcoholism , etc . But lectures ! And lectures to audiences altogether mixed as to age , social class and offense ! Whatever the lecturer said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Inevitably the lectures are dull . The universal recognition that the Pre-Release Lecture is pro forma only , is expressed most clearly by the way my alma mater selected those who were to hear it . By length of time remaining to serve ? No . By fraction of sentence remaining to serve ? By seriousness of expected readjustment difficulties ? None of these  --  but by cell assignment . Thus most men were released having heard none , others a dozen or more . But the time counts . Even the dullest hour is an hour , and after enough of them you 're through. , What you 've accomplished while in prison will be close to nothing . Still , you may have accomplished something just by going , if your offense was well chosen . 437
