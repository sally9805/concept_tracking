Much ado about a sexy monk <P> " RaRa Rasputin , lover of the Russian Queen/ Russia 's greatest love machine . " <P> Those improbable lyrics , belted out by a Jamaican reggae-rock group called Boney M. , are from the hottest pop tune in the Soviet Union . In restaurants and bars throughout the country last week , disc jockeys were spinning the group 's recording of Rasputin , which has been issued by the government record company Melodiya . At the same time , curiously , the sellout novel of the year depicts Grigori Rasputin 's sexual escapades , including boudoir frolics with Russia 's last empress , the Tsarina Alexandra . <P> Our Contemporary , the journal of the Russian Writers Union , is currently serializing At the Last Frontier by Valentin Pikul . The book is a canny mix of fact and rumor about the monk , whose skill in doctoring the Tsarina 's sick son gained him inordinate influence over the royal family in the final decade of the Russian empire . By prudish Soviet standards , Pikul 's empurpled prose is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Rasputin sneaks up to the Tsarina as she prays for her hemophiliac son . Out of the shadows steps the " bony peasant , his face framed by long hair parted in the center and glistening with oil , his eyes emitting a kind of hypnotic sparkle .

So do passages alluding to Rasputin 's vast sexual appetite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ historians . But the book seemingly has other and more unsavory functions . One is to encourage the xenophobia that still has a strong hold on the many Russian chauvinists in the elite , who believe that alien forces have caused their homeland 's troubles down through the ages . One handy target is the German-born Alexandra , who is described in the novel as a featherbrained traitor to Russia . Pikul 's fictional Tsar Alexander III is quoted as saying of his future daughter-in-law and her German relatives , " I have a feeling they have a lot in their pants but very little under their hats . " <P> Even more striking is the book 's appeal to antiSemitism . According to Pikul , Rasputin was the tool of " Zionists , " who exploited his political influence on the imperial family , paying the monk off with bonds , cash and cases of his favorite Madeira . With backing from Jewish bankers , Rasputin and his secretary , Aaron Simonovich , allegedly owned several night clubs " with card tables , and a buffet frequented by strange-looking , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
