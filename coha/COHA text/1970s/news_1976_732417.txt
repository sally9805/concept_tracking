txt For President Ford in an election year , the U.S. economy is performing well ? unemployment , though still high , is declining . So is inflation . Output steadily is picking up . All this , Ford aides believe , - draws wind from the sails of the President 's Democratic challengers , both in Congress and on the campaign hustings , where it is charged that the White House is not doing enough to put people back to work . Latest bit of good news for Ford aides this week : The Wholesale Price Index fell 0.5 percent in February , reported the U.S. Department of Labor ? fourth month in a row this key indicator has shown no increase . Alan Greenspan , Mr. Ford 's chief economic adviser , told reporters at breakfast that economic recovery is proceeding so well the nation 's jobless rate " possibly " may drop below 7 perbent by the end of 1976 . If Mr. Greenspan is right , about 700,000 Americans now unemployed would regain their jobs this year . That is in addition to 2 million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of unemployment ? 8.9 percent of the labor force ? was reached last May . Current unemployment totals 7.8 percent . The White House hopes to do better than its original projection of a 7 to 7.5 percent jobless rate by year-end . Democratic leaders say improvement to date is insufficient . They favor the creation of public service jobs , to be funded by taxpayers ' money , to put people back to work more quickly . Mr. Ford , who claims this approach would be inflationary , vetoed a $6.1 billion public works bill , which ? according to its Democratic sponsors ? would have created 600,000 jobs . As 1976 began , the White House forecast a 6.3 percent consumer inflation rate for the year and a wholesale price increase of 7 percent . So far inflation has held well within those limits . Wholesale prices often foreshadow future performance of retail prices . Thus Mr. Greenspan foresees " no unusual price pressures " developing in the economy over the next few months . Consumer prices ? which rose 8.8 percent in 1973 , a huge 12.2 percent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increase in 1975 ? now are climbing at about a 6 percent clip // *Democrats prod recovery but Ford warns of inflation // The wholesale price index soared 15.4 percent in 1973 , 20.9 percent in 1974 , then dipped sharply to a 4.2 percent increase last year . Mr. Greenspan , chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers ( CEA ) , gives two reasons why the U.S. economy should " continue upward in a rather solid way " with " no structural imbalances " in sight : ? Business inventories are at " rock bottom . " As merchants restock their shelves and warehouses , new manufacturing jobs should be created . ? The market for capital goods ? machinery and other heavy goods required by industry ? is beginning to pick up , forecasting further increases in jobs . Mr. Greenspan and other presidential advisers claim that Mr. Ford 's fiscal restraint policies ? holding government spending as low as possible ? have helped to curb inflation without retarding recovery . One must take a risk , says Mr. Greenspan , in deciding whether to use fiscal restraint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economy . Stimulus , applied through higher spending , lower taxes , or both , forces more money into circulation , may create jobs , but also ? in Mr. Greenspan 's view ? threatens to reignite inflation . Also , he said , it is very hard to turn off the tap of stimulus quickly enough to prevent inflation from getting out of control . Congress , he added , is reluctant to reduce spending or increase taxes to put on the fiscal brakes . Conversely , said the CEA chief , if experience proves that restraint is slowing down recovery , Congress and White House can promptly pump in stimulus by lowering taxes or increasing spending . Contributing to the February drop in wholesale prices was a 2.3 percent decline in farm and food prices , paced by lower costs for live poultry and livestock . Fuel prices also fell slightly . These declines more than offset a 0.3 percent increase in industrial prices . Even this increase , however , was the lowest in this category in nine months . Over the last three months wholesale prices have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
