" The bandwagon is rolling . The steamroller is on . " So lamented Morris Udall last week as he ruefully watched more and more top Democratic politicians and labor honchos line up behind Jimmy Carter . <P> With 610 delegates in hand ( needed to nominate : 1,505 ) , Carter has decided to spend fewer 16-hr , days on the campaign trail and more time trying to unite the party behind him-a goal that eluded George McGovern in 1972 and Hubert Humphrey in 1968 . With some success , he solicited support at the meeting of black Democratic leaders in Charlotte , N.C. ( see following story ) , then spent several days at home in Plains , Ga. , phoning scores of Democratic union leaders , members of Congress , Governors , mayors , state and local party chiefs . Among those he wooed were Democratic Chairman Robert Strauss , former Chairman Larry O'Brien , Chicago Mayor Richard Daley , New York Governor Hugh Carey and Missouri Senator Thomas Eagleton . ' <P> Most of the Democrats showed prudent and respectful new interest for Carter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Said Alan Baron , Senator George McGovern 's press secretary , of the sentiment among liberals : " It is more resignation ' than enthusiasm . They 've stopped resisting . " Some Democrats want Carter to win more primaries before coming out for him . Others are playing hard to get , even though there is no indication that Carter is willing to make any deals . Daley is thought to be willing to trade his endorsement for a promise from Carter to choose Illinois Senator Adlai Stevenson as his running mate . New York Mayor Abraham Beame wants Carter to spell out what he would do as President for financially hard-pressed cities . To make it clear that they are not yet backing Carter , House Speaker Carl Albert and Senator Hubert Humphrey pointedly showed up at a coffee-and-doughnuts session in Washington for California Governor Jerry Brown . Said Humphrey : " Brown adds an exciting new dimension . It would be presumptuous to say that Carter has the nomination locked up . " <P> United Effort . Despite Humphrey 's showing of the flag for Brown , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unity is of paramount importance . According to Carter staffers , Humphrey is thinking of endorsing Carter at some time after the last primaries on June 8 . As Manhattan Borough President Percy <P> Sutton said : " Most politicians deal with reality , and reality points toward Carter . " Predicts Party Chairman Strauss : " We will have our most united effort since 1964 this November . Carter will not cause the kinds of antagonisms that George McGovern did in 1972 . " <P> Senator Birch Bayh was the only former candidate to become a twice-born Carter zealot last week and helped the Georgian roll up a 68% victory in Indiana . Some politicians viewed Bayh 's move as his bid to become Carter 's running mate . The Georgian was also endorsed by Texas Governor Dolph Briscoe and Henry Ford II . On the other hand , Carter 's lukewarm backing of McGovern four years ago still rankles . Said McGovern : " I will support Jimmy Carter with the same enthusiasm with which he supported the Democratic ticket in 1972. "       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
