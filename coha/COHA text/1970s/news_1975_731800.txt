txt The Supreme Court ruled unanimously today that President Nixon did not have the right to impound $9-billion in water pollution funds approved by Congress because the legislation authorizing the program had not given him that authority . The case , the first on impoundment to reach the high court , did not involve the more complicated question of whether a President has implied power under the Constitution to refuse to spend money that Congress has appropriated . That issue is still being debated in the lower courts . Although they did not say so directly , the Justices appeared to order the immediate release of $5-billion of the funds that Mr. Nixon impounded , and President Ford has since classed as " deferred , " or indefinitely postponed . Mr. Ford released $4-billion on Jan. 27 . Allocation Process Slow As a practical matter , however , the decision may have little immediate impact . A spokesman for the Environmental Protection Agency said that the $5-billion had been considered available for some " time , and that the allocation process was so slow that it would not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Connecticut , environmental officials estimated that the two states would eventually receive at least $690-million as a result of the Court 's ruling .

What the ruling might mean for the remaining $8-billion or more that the Ford Administration is still withholding in construction , health and other environmental funds was anybody 's guess . White Writes Decision In programs based nn statutes like the Water Pollution Act of 1972 , the money may now have to be released , following today 's precedent . In other programs where a different ? sort of authority was invoked by the Administration , the money may remain impounded , awaiting the outcome of further legal action . The decision was a victory for New York City , which had challenged Mr. Nixon 's order to restrict Federal aid for sewers and sewage treatment works . The former President had impounded the $9-billion immediately after Congress overrode his veto of the Water Pollution Act . Writing for the Court , Associate Justice Byron R. White // said that the legislation " was intended to provide a firm commitment of substantial sums @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effort to achieve an early solution of what was deemed an urgent problem . " " We can not believe , " he continued , " that Congress at the last minute scuttled the entire effort by providing the executive with the seemingly limitless power to withhold funds from allotment and obligation . " Associate Justice William 0 . Douglas concurred in the result of the decision , but did not offer any season for not also endorsing the legal reasoning supporting it . The high court presumably decided the case shortly after it was argued in November ; long before Mr. Douglas was hospitalized by a stroke on Jan. 1 . New York City , joined by several upstate cities and later Detroit , won its case in Federal District Court , and the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit affirmed the ruling , holding " the act requires the administrator to allot the full sums .

This argument was dropped , however , in the Government 's subsequent briefs and oral argument . Position Is Changed In the lower courts , the Government maintained that the President . had unlimited power to impound funds . In the Supreme Court , however , the Administration conceded that the full $18-billion approved by Congress for water pollution projects would have to be spent eventually , but not necessarily on the Congressional schedule of $5-billion in 1973 , $6-billion in 1974 and $7-billion in 1975 . In his Budget Message this year , President Ford listed the $9-billion at issue as " deferred , " a classification set by the 1974 Congressional Budget Act for money that will be spent eventually but not during the coming fiscal year . Mr. Ford said at that time that " release of all these funds would be highly inflationary , particularly in view of the rapid rise in non-Federal spending for pollution control .

The A.F.L.-C.I.O . Building and Construction Trades Department hailed today 's decision of the Supreme Court on the impounded sewer funds as " a shot in the arm that could turn the whole American ' economy around . " The money would produce more than 364,000 jobs , the department estimated , and stimulate S3-billion more in state and local matching funds , creating an additional 121,500 jobs .
