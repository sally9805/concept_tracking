Even as a successful music executive , Schuyler G. Chapin would sometimes have a fantasy about a genie rising from a bottle and asking him what he wanted most in life . Chapin would reply , " I 'd like to be general manager of the Metropolitan Opera . " Last week in New York , the genie delivered . After a full season as acting general manager ( TIME , March 5 ) , Chapin , 50 , was given a three-year contract for the real thing-the most powerful job in opera . <P> It was a popular decision , if long in coming . Chapin had amply shown that he could run a smooth operation , and that it was possible to have aristocratic savoir-faire without resorting to the autocratic methods of former Met Manager Rudolf Bing . As many a diva has learned , Chapin 's tact and graciousness do not signal a relaxed will . He pushed hard and successfully for the company 's new Mini-Met , devoted to intimate or experimental operas in small halls with mostly young casts . To the Met @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aura of good will between management and unions fostered by his predecessor , Goran Gentele , who was killed last July in a car crash in Sardinia before he ever really had a chance to run the Met . <P> Until Gentele hired him as his No. 2 man , Chapin had never worked in an opera house . Instead , he had served early on as a tour manager for Columbia Artists Management , later as head of Columbia Records ' classical department , Lincoln Center 's vice president for programming and executive producer of Leonard Bernstein 's various television , film and musical enterprises . <P> Aside from Herbert Witherspoon , who died within weeks of taking over in 1935 , Chapin is the Met 's first American-born general manager in 77 years . It was appropriate therefore that Chapin should take the opportunity to announce , as his first official act as manager , that at long last Soprano Beverly Sills will make her Met debut in 1975 in Rossini 's Siege of Corinth.               @ @ @ @ @ @
