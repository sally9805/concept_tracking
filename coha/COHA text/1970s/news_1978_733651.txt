My whole life seems out of control , and I do n't know what 's wrong . " Winkler helped him put together a list of things wrong with him that he could try to change to please his wife , such as shaving off his beard and mustache , which he did , losing weight , and cutting down his drinking . Earlier , the prosecution showed pictures of the grisly murder scene to the jury while the blood-stained mallet and Bowie knife that Nelson used to crush his children 's skulls and slit their throats were displayed on the prosecution table .                 @ @ @ @
