Last year technology put pocket calculators under the Christmas tree . This year 's great space-age spin-off is the digital watch . Hailed by one effusive manufacturer as " probably the greatest breakthrough in timekeeping technology since the sundial , " the solid-state , quartz-crystal " time calculator " displays the time ( and , on the more expensive models , the month and date ) with glowing numbers , rather than hands moving around a clock face . Digitals are expected to account for at least 5% of all watches sold in the U.S. in 1975-some 2.5 million-at prices ranging from $30 to more than $3,000 . Acknowledged to be as accurate as any watch now available-losing or gaining only a minute a year-the digital comes in two basic models : the L.E.D. ( for light-emitting diode ) and the L.C.D . ( liquid crystal display ) . On the L.E.D.s , the digits light up at the press of a button or , on some models , at the flick of the wrist . The L.C.D . provides a continuous display , but to be seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> Feeling of Power . Since most models are bulky , the watches so far have sold mainly to men . One reason for their appeal is the **29;6211;TOOLONG syndrome , though this attraction will fade fast ; digitals are expected to sell for as little as $20 in 1976 . Another reason why some people like digitals , according to a watch-company executive , " is that it makes them feel powerful-at the push of a button , they can command the time . " Says Manhattan-based Writer Jon Borgzinner : " I like it because when I pick it up at night I do n't have to figure out from the dial if it 's ten of six or two minutes before four ; it simply tells me it 's 4:14 or 9:53 . " <P> The next development in watches , a few Christmases hence , will be the nuclear timepiece , powered by a radioactive cell that will last 50 years . Until then , Pulsar , a pioneer digital manufacturer , has decided to more than make do with existing technology . It has put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -a digital watch combined with a miniaturized calculator that enables the wearer to add , subtract , divide and multiply . It can calculate figures up to 999 billion , and has a memory bank . Pulsar will manufacture only a limited number of the solid-gold , 22-key calculator watches at $3,950 each . Next year the Pennsylvania-based company will market a stainless steel model priced at " under $600. "
