txt FIRST ARTHUR HALL thought his son had been shot . There was a loud roar in the kitchen , and then his son yelled , " They got me ! " just like in the movies , and then Arthur Hall was up from his bedsheets in a flash to see what horror had come calling on peaceful people in the middle of the night . Arthur Sr. burst through the connecting doorway into the small bedroom off the kitchen just as Arthur Jr . staggered in , his face a crimson mask of blood . The son threw an arm around his father as if to hug him , and Arthur Sr. got him down . " I 'm not going to see no more . I 'm blind , " the son groaned in agony as his father pulled him to the bed . " Arthur , " Close-up With Jeff Lyon the young man said , " Arthur , pray with me . " And the father prayed with his son . " He was laying there in that bed , " Arthur Sr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that part of his left arm blown all to pieces and we said the Lord 's prayer and I said ' you 're gon na be all right . ' " IIE IS ONLY 24 years old , Arthur Hall Jr . He 's a young man of hard work , thrift , and family duty , the kind of black they ought to weave stereotypes around but never do . He had finished his night shift at the Sunbeam plant in Cicero and set off for home , stopping once on south Green Street to pick up his brother , and again at a liquor mart for a six-pack of beer . Then they had arrived at the aging.frame house with the peaked roof at 7434 S. Oakley Av. , that Arthur had bought for his parents last October . Simplicity itself . A man comes home from work .

Reporters were still crunching around in the wreckage of the Hall family 's kitchen shortly after the blast when the police said they doubted it was a racial incident . Now a was 6:30 in the morning , a few hours later . Allen Campbell . also WhO is black . was leaving her brown Mick bungalow a block away from the Hag ironic , for work . ' " THE PAPER was laying right by the door and my foot hit it , " Campbell , 32 , recalled a few hours later . " I looked back and saw wire leading from it back to the door handle . I got scared .

Two booby-trap bombs designed to kill or maim , placed at the homes of two black families in the highly charged , racially changing neighborhood just east ' of Marquette Park . The police now said they were investigating the " possibility " of a racial motive . Whatever the police think , the blacks of the neighborhood are taking it that way . " Why should they want to hurt us ' ' Campbell asked , as he sat on the stone railing of his front porch . " We do n't hurt nobody . People got ta live somewhere . You pay your mortgage on time , and you keep up your properly , and that 's all that should count. ?

We lived on south Yates before this , but we had a misunderstanding with the landlord over payin ' high rent and we figured we 'd be better off buying a home . I was aware this neighborhood was a ticklish situation when we moved in , but it did n't botherme . I figured nobody helps me pay off my mortgage , so why should they tell me where to live ? If I fit the qualifications , why should n't I live here ? " Campbell is a muscular man with a beard and Afro , both of which are tinged with red . He moves safes and heavy machinery for a living . " No . I ai n't pintail ' on movin ' , " he said . " I been lucre too long . And there ai n't too many places you can go anti not have problems .

A green muslin curtain dangled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Pieces of glass filled the sideyard among the clover , and a kitchen chair back had been blown outside . Two bomb squad detectives were in front . Both were while . " They 're going to try to make this racial , " one of them was saying . " But this ai n't racial . This ai n't the type of bomb they use with a racial bombing . " " What type of bontb do they use for racial bombings ? " he was asked " Awn , . firebombs , they throw things through the windows , Molotov cocktails . This was a different kind . " INSIDE THE gray frame house with the red trim rind peaked roof , Arthur Hall Sr. was talking quietly . He is a gentle man , a janitor in a Northfield Catholic school , a man who has brought up seven children and wanted better than this . " I do n't know who did this , " lie said . " Somebody crazy . I think it was some nut who wanted to do something to make people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and make people act the fool . He wants to get people riled up to fight the whites . But I 'll not do it . " He moved from the neat living room , with its yellow chairs and sofa encased in plastic slipcovers , to the shambles of a kitchen . The blast had mangled the dishwasher , torn a huge chunk from the kitchen table , and malted fragments of newspaper to the wall . The floor was rubble . Pulverized fiberboard and Masonite formed a cushion for broken china and pots ; a Mixmaster blade lay next to a jar of vanilla extract . Beer cans were everywhere , twisted tike shrapnel . 111r. hall just shook his head . ? MATS ( ( IS eyeglasses. " he said . A pair of wire rims , minus the lenses , lay twisted where they had fallen , to feet from the blast site . " They do n't know it the glass got in his eyes . yet . That 's what they do n't know .

' : I said goodbye to him , a gentle father of seven in work clothes and an International Harvester cap , a man who still chooses not to hale . As I descended the porch stairs , where someone had placed a bomb in a newspaper for a man to pick up , I could hear the father crying softly . In a Chicago hospital a young luau lies maimed . And somewhere in this city , a monster is loose .
