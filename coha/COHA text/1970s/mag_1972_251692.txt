IT has always been a source of great annoyance to scientists : though the Apollo program is one of the milestones in the history of scientific exploration , they have been precluded from participating directly in it . Now , confident of the Apollo landing techniques perfected by the military pilots on previous missions , NASA has chosen a handsome 37-year-old geologist named Harrison ( " Jack " ) Schmitt to be copilot of Apollo 17 . If all goes well , Schmitt next week will take a historic step : he will become the first scientist from earth to walk on another world . <P> Schmitt 's preparation began long before Apollo was conceived . The son of a mining geologist , he grew up in Silver City , N. Mex. , and decided early in life to become a geologist himself . As a youngster he visited mining camps , explored Indian reservations and made rock-hunting forays into the lunar-like deserts of the Southwest . At Caltech he studied under Ian Campbell and other noted earth scientists , including some of the men who will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ science support room . <P> In 1964 , armed with a new doctorate in geology from Harvard , Schmitt joined the U.S. Geological Survey at Flagstaff , Ariz . There he was assigned the job of assembling photographs taken by unmanned Ranger spacecraft into detailed lunar maps for future moon walkers . Schmitt was fascinated by the task . Recalls former NASA Geologist Gene Shoemaker : " Jack caught the space bug . " Indeed , as soon as NASA began recruiting scientist-astronauts in 1965 , Schmitt applied . He was accepted despite a minor physical problem : an unusual and painful elongation of the large intestine . <P> The decision by NASA doctors proved sound . Throughout his rigorous preparation , the geologist-astronaut has maintained superb health and excelled as a trainee . He ranked second in his class of 50 at Air Force flight school , and has spent countless hours on field trips everywhere from Iceland to Hawaii teaching fellow astronauts how to spot and select geologically significant rocks . He worked closely with NASA scientists in devising scoops , shovels and other tools for the moon . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deserves a flight , it is Jack Schmitt . " <P> As a professional geologist , Schmitt will be under intense pressure to provide his colleagues with the best possible lunar specimens and descriptions of the landscape . To make sure that his performance meets his own high standards , Schmitt has been working at a furious pace . Scientists in Houston still talk about the time they took Schmitt to lunch at a local topless restaurant , where they all engaged in the usual space-flight shoptalk . Later , when one of the group asked what he thought of the amply proportioned girl who had served him , Bachelor Schmitt was astonished . " When was she topless ? " he asked . " I did n't even notice . "
