The home-town Hornets have just blanked the circuit-leading Mudhens , and the " writers " - as athletes tend to call reporters-are crowded into the Hornet locker room . There in the whirlpool bath is Ace Hurler Ace Hurley , naked as a slow curve , telling a cub reporter how he fanned the last three enemy swatters . She is scribbling fast . <P> <P> She ? The locker room , perhaps the last defensible male bastion in journalism , has gone coed . Since the National Hockey League broke the ice last year , more and more pro teams are admitting women to the sanctuaries of sweat . It is perhaps the biggest breakthrough for female scribes since Jane Swisshelm became the first woman reporter to invade the congressional press gallery more than a century ago . <P> Once a rarity , a woman sportswriter has become a fixture at a majority of major U.S. dailies . Of the 180 or so American print journalists accredited to this month 's Montreal Olympics , about a dozen are women-not many , but possibly ten more than were at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relegated to covering women 's basketball , field hockey and sport fashions , but now work such brawny beats as football and boxing . Indeed , the demand for women writers may be outstripping the supply . Says Blackie Sherrod , sports editor of the Dallas Times-Herald : " I wish I had one . Everybody 's looking for one . What I 'd give for a good one ! " <P> Good ones are proving they can do as well as men-or better . Newsday 's Jane Gross , 28 , scooped the competition by slogging through court records to come up with a copy of Nets Forward Julius Erving 's $1.9 million contract . <P> <P> Lynn Rosellini , 29 , was recommended by the Washington Star for a Pulitzer Prize for her four-part series on homosexuality in sports , a topic male reporters have generally avoided . Mary Garber , 60 , has been covering sports for the Winston-Salem Journal since 1944 , and colleagues agree that she is the toughest interviewer in town . <P> Talk v. Action . Despite such performances , women sportswriters still face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less on the play by play and more on the thoughts , problems and personal lives of athletes , and women can be at a disadvantage in getting close to their sources . " There is too much misunderstanding , too much innuendo if you try , " says the Washington Star 's Kathleen Maxa , 27 . Assigned to cover a major tennis tournament last summer , Maxa talked a famous European player into an exclusive interview and accompanied him to his hotel , where it turned out that he was less interested in talk than action . <P> Nearly all male sportswriters have grown up breathing sports rules and statistics ; many of the women newcomers lack that heritage of trivia . Cyndi Meagher , 28 , who last year was transferred from the Detroit News " Accent on Living " page to the sports department , has made a few embarrassing mistakes , like confusing a stolen base with a runner 's advancing on a throwing error . One irate fan mailed her a jock strap .            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
