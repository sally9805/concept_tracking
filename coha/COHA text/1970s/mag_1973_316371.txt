Though the U.S. is running short of oil and natural gas , it has enough coal to last for hundreds of years . But environmental laws forbid burning much of the nation 's available coal because it contains large quantities of sulfur . When the high-sulfur coal is burned , it gives off sulfur dioxide ( SO2 ) , an invisible gas that kills plants , corrodes metals and injures human health . <P> Now General Motors reports a new process that reduces SO2 emissions by 90% . Tested successfully for 14 months in a pilot installation at the Chevrolet plant in Parma , Ohio , GM 's process starts with a trap to take dust particles out of coal smoke . Then the gases are routed into a device called a scrubber , where they bubble through a caustic-soda solution ; chemical reaction between the SO2 and the soda produces two salts , sodium sulfite and sodium sulfate , that are pumped from the scrubber in waste liquids into tanks . There , lime and calcium carbonate are added . The resulting calcium salts settle to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safe landfill . The remaining liquid flows into another tank where it is treated with chemicals to create more caustic-soda solution for the scrubber-and the process begins anew . <P> GM is expanding its system to serve the entire Chevrolet-Parma plant . That will cost $3,000,000 . But the process will pay for itself by allowing GM-or any other industrial user-to burn the cheapest and most abundant of all fuels : high-sulfur coal .
