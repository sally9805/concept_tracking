meal , represented in his mind just about the optimum way of moving across Europe . The Lombard column in the paper had Melekov 's full attentionwhen the final person to board the plane , somewhat out of breath , took his seat directly in front of Melekov . Well , it almosthad his full attention . Melekov had lived all his life in an atmosphere where constant surveillance of the people in his vicinity was a necessity for survival . To be sure , due to his age and geographical location , he had missed the very worst of the Stalinist purges . But things had been touch and go twice  --  in the mid-50s and again in 1964 . He knew that he had reached a level of power where he was by definition vulnerable  --  to everything and everyone . The last man in was Bollinger . Should I ? thought Melekov . No . Not yet , you never know . The two men knew each other well . Both had attended the London School of Economics in 1937 . Melekov went back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they insisted on printing on paper of that colour . There must be a reason . There must also have been a reason for Bollinger being in London and nobody talking about it . Bollinger appeared fidgety . He adjusted the back of his seat for the third time . He looked a hit worn , too , when he came in . Well , not exactly worn . Burdened . No , that was n't the right word either . Melekov 's thoughts kept switching back and forth from his paper to the man now more or less settled in front of him . The door of the plane was closed , and gradually they started working their way toward the end of the runway for takeoff . In spite of a huge volume of traffic , by far the greatest in Europe , for some reason one never had those ridiculous lineups like in New York . Within five minutes they were airborne . Melekov liked to watch London from the air  --  especially at this time of the evening . The spread of the city was simply enormous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , part in yellow , part in a most pure white , gave the impression of an infinity of densely packed people . Los Angeles gave something of the same impact . But not really the same . There the horizon was broken by upthrusting mountains . Here the rows of lights seemed to travel as far as the eye could reach . Melekov ordered a dry martini  --  with gin , on the rocks . He observed that Bollinger had done the same . Melekov took out the olive and ate it . He always did that . Bollinger had needed that one . He called the girl back within no more than two minutes and asked for a second . He then beganwrestling with his briefcase . By the time the girl had returned , he had apparently retrieved the object of his grappling search  --  a rather ridiculously bound dossier , in bright red of all things . It 's really not all that easy to watch somebody sitting right in front of you in an airplane . But Melekov had the advantage of the sudden darkness which had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cloud cover at over two thousand metres . It made a perfect mirror of the windows , provided the angle was right . Melekov remained hunched over his window , apparently awed by the fact that there was absolutely nothing to see . It was impossible to follow the text of the document in the hands of the man in front of him . But a flash impression of the capitalized words in mid-page , apparently following a lead-in paragraph , burned into Melekov 's brain : ADJUSTING THEGOLD-DOLLAR PARITY . What the hell , thought Melekov . If  --  but no . Probably just another new study on monetary reform by some genius at the Bank of England . But why does Bollinger appear so  --  harried ! That 's the word I was looking for . Harried . He 's not the type . Bollinger slammed the dossier closed , and with a bit more bouncing around  --  which normally can prove damned annoyingfor fellow passengers in the vicinity  --  once again retrieved his briefcase , put the document back in , closed it , locked it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to finish his drink with an almost audible sigh . Melekov settled back in his seat and ordered a second one40 41himself . They were already starting to cross the Channel , according to the loudspeaker . The rumblings beyond the curtain indicated that dinner would shortly be underway . Apparently the drinks had already gotten to Bollinger . He rose and headed toward the washroom . Melekov 's eyes automaticallyfollowed his movements . Bollinger was taking his briefcase with him to the toilet ! Three minutes later Bollinger returned toward his seat . This time he seemed less preoccupied than when he had boarded . He surveyed the five people up front with no apparent special interest . Melekov put aside his newspaper and looked up . Recognitionstruck both faces simultaneously , and Melekov rose from his seat as Bollinger moved toward him . " Igor ! " exclaimed Bollinger . " What a surprise ! " " Extremely nice to see you again , Reinhardt , " replied Melekov . " Why do n't we have a drink together ? " " Well , actually I 've already had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free up here . And I 'm sure that you are just as pooped as I am after a day in London . " Bollinger accepted the invitation to join Melekov without any further hesitation . But first he deposited his briefcase at his window seat . The girl accepted the order for a third set of dry martinis as gracefully as airline stewardesses accept any requestthese days and returned with the glasses immediately . Probably a hint that it was time to eat , not drink . " Zum Wohl , " said Melekov , and Bollinger reciprocated with a tip of his glass . " Well , well , " said Bollinger , " you 're going to honour us with a visit to Switzerland ? " " Just a very short one . It 's been six months since my last trip . You remember , we had lunch in the Baur au Lac , Reinhardt . " " I remember well  --  especially the three , or was it four , kirschwassers , following dessert . Tell me , are you satisfied with the progress of your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answered Melekov . " We actually never did intend to make our Zurich operation too big . But still , we thought we had to get our foot into Switzerland just like everyone else these days . The money and capital markets  --  and , of course , the foreign exchange business  --  is just too big to be ignored . But London and Paris will remain our chief operational centres in Western Europe . " " How about the personnel problem ? " queried Bollinger . Melekov chuckled , " Reinhardt , you 'd be surprised . We have much less of a problem getting good people than most of the domestic banks . I think that it 's probably curiosity . " " Tell me , " continued Bollinger , " is there by any chance anythingwe at the BIS can do for you fellows these days ? " " Actually there is . I think some of our people  --  from Moscow , not Zurich  --  will be contacting you again within the next couple of days . We have decided to sell twenty million ounces of gold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handle it . This is the first time in years that we will be selling , and we hope that you will be especially careful to handle the transactionwith the usual utmost discretion . " " Right , " replied Bollinger . " No worry there , as you should know by now . You must think the gold price is going to hold for a while right where it is , I assume ? " " That 's always a difficult question . For years the free price in Zurich and London has been moving back and forth between$55 and $75 an ounce . It 's really just luck if you pick a week where you are selling nearer one than the other . We ca n't always choose just that exact moment we would like , you know . It 's no secret to you or anybody else that we are going to have to make some big payments soon on our wheat imports from the United States . Our supplies of grain , as you must well know , have fallen to catastrophically low levels . So we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usual this winter . Do you think we are making a mistake on timing ? " Melekov watched Bollinger 's face with the greatest possible concentration . No doubt about it , there was a flicker of hesitationbefore he answered . " Well , Igor , as you know we really do not have any opinions at the BIS except for those which we publish in our annual report . But I can say this : every central bank in the world has faced the same dilemma for years , namely what proportion oftheir international reserves they should hold in gold relative to dollars . Of course , your country is in a special position . Like South Africa you produce gold in quantity , and for you it is not just a currency reserve unit but an industrial product , if you like . I would guess that in your case , as you just indicatedin fact , to sell , buy , or hold gold is not just a decision upon your judgment of the world monetary situation but is closely related to your varying needs for dollars for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instance . " " Thanks for the advice , Reinhardt . " " Now Igor , who started this whole Eurodollar merry-goroundin the first place , anyway ? I should be asking the questions , not you . " The girl arrived with two trays . Both bankers attacked their somewhat overdone steaks with gusto . No sooner had they finished than the coffee was served . Both helped themselves to cognac . Neither apparently had any desire to talk shop any longer , and the conversation had drifted back to the late 1930s : to mutual friends , Chamberlain , pubs . During disembarkation Bollinger extended an invitation to Melekov to drop over to Basel for lunch , if he had time . Melekov declined with thanks . He only planned to be in Switzerland for one day . But he did mention that he would greatly appreciate any courtesy which Bollinger might extend to his colleagues and their 20 million ounces of gold . They agreed to keep in touch . Bollinger had to hurry to make his connecting flight to Basel . Melekov proceeded through the labyrinth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take Russians seriouslyin Zurich  --  was met and duly escorted to the waiting car by a reception committee of three . He was back in the fold of the Soviet collective . At nine-twenty-five the next morning Melekov boarded Aeroflot flight 61  --  nonstop to Moscow. 5Two days later , on October 20 , Stanley Rosen landed in Beirut , coming from New York via Paris . He looked beat . He also looked a bit wary . This was the first time he had ever ventured into Arab territory . Sure , he was quite aware of the fact that Lebanon was not strictly Arab in that sense . Nevertheless , there was no doubt about a certain tightness in his stomachwhich had nothing to do with the usual effects of longdistanceair travel . For some reason the plane had been waved off on its first approach from the sea and had had to make a very wide lazy circle , high over Lebanon , before landing . Rosen had been amazed , and even shocked , when the captain had pointed out that Damascus could be seen as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mountains against which Beirut snuggled . So close to the lion 's den . Rosen was , of course , Jewish . But a very watered-down American version . After his childhood in New Jersey he had had absolutely no connection with his ancestral religion . This was not deliberate : it was just so . When he was in New York , it was seldom that he ever gave any thought to his origins . But in Europe , on every trip his consciousness of the fact was somehowrefreshed . He was never reminded in a really nasty sense . But reminded just the same . The facilities at the airport were no great shakes , and it seemed to take ages before he had cleared customs . Outside the building he immediately found a cab , American-size , and after a thirty-minute ride through what seemed to be a surprisingly European city , he arrived at the Phoenicia . Except for the Arab getup of the doorman , he could have been in MiamiBeach . While he was waiting for the check-in formalities to be completed , he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ urn , or whatever it was called . Phony , but interesting . He hated this kind of coffee , but when in . . . His room was strictly non-Arab . The menu featured hamburgersalong with shashlik . The bellhop was all smiles . The maid was dark but cute . Stanley was slowly regaining his equilibrium . It may seem strange that a man worth at least $20 million could ever lose his equilibrium in this world of the 1970s . But though quite aware of the safety and protection which money assured , Stanley Rosen was equally sensitive to the fact that he had earned it quickly . And although he had earned it on Wall Street , it had been on the wrong side of that narrow street . He was known as one of the cleverest financial operators in New York ; he was a regular for lunch downstairs at the " 21 " Club ; his phone calls were usually accepted without hesitation . But he had never seen the inside of the New York Athletic Club , and he had never been asked upstairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he managed over $1 billion in assets . Some people put the figure appreciably higher . The success of Stanley Rosen lay in the fact that he was endowed with a mental adeptness of almost unique character . Furthermore , he was willing to apply his mind to everything  --  literally everything  --  that had to do with money , its management , its use to make still more money . But he never gambled . During the days of the great bull market in the mid-1960s Rosen did not plunge into new hot issues with his clients ' funds . He specialized in merger arbitrage and was satisfied with a more or less 20 percent return per annum . He deliberatelyrejected opportunities for doubling his money through access to a block of shares of sure-fire new companies . In those days of euphoria , instead of using margin facilities , he kept at least 25 percent of his funds in certificates of deposit and Treasury bills , and as the Dow Jones Industrial climbed toward1000 steadily , he increased the cash or near cash components of the portfolios he managed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one could get a substantially higher return in dollars by lending them out in Europe for periods of three to twelve months ( less one day  --  for tax reasons ) , against essentially no risk whatsoever , for the borrowers were the largest financial institutionsin the world . And there was where he had most of the funds he managed , while the New York Stock Exchange was dropping week after week and month after month in the grim days of 1969 and early 1970 . In mid-1970 Rosen had massivelyswitched continents once more , putting almost everythingback into New York : T-bills , Fannie Mae , and blue chips . By early 1971 he was back in Europe . This time he concentrated on German chemical company stocks and shares of the Big Four Swiss Banks . He stayed there quite a while and made another pile in the process . Then he moved to Tokyo and made still another . Rosen knew how to consistently make money in both bull and bear markets . Obviously a good man to know . When people first met Stanley , they found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fairly tubby . His clothes hung . His shoes were rarely polished . A blue tie and a green shirt were not unusual . He spoke rapidly , most indistinctly , and with a truly atrocious New York accent . When riding with him from Wall Street to midtown , more than one of his new clients had the thought that Stanley would have much more aptly fitted behind the wheel of the limousine than in the back seat . There was another feature of Stanley which one could not overlook . He liked girls  --  lots of them . And the damndest thing was that girls really liked Stanley , with or without limousine , with or without the " 21 . " It never failed to astound his associateswhen Stanley inevitably ended up with the real stunner at a party , whether in Beverly Hills , the Bahamas , or GreenwichVillage . Rosen did not fool around with small clients . The minimum portfolio he would take on was $5 million . He never solicited46 47clients , and in fact he had not taken on any new unsolicited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? More than a few people in both New York and Washington wondered who his clientele were  --  in fact , more than just wondered . Stanley knew this quite well , and therefore he ran his New York shop in a fashion which was impeccable  --  a model of accounting practices , up-to-dateness , orderliness , supervisedwith ultra-scrupulous attention to all laws of the land . No , Stanley did not run The Vatican 's money . The blunt fact was that Rosen handled the funds of a group of gentlemen who ranked among the most successful businessmen of the twentiethcentury  --  in Las Vegas , Miami , Chicago , Boston , New jersey . All of them had backgrounds as humble as that of Stanley himself . All of them had accumulated immense liquid wealth since World War II . But none of them had direct access to the legitimate money and capital markets of the world or to the reputable money managers of the world  --  be they the trust departments of banks , the big-name investment houses in New York , or the la-di-da private counselors in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in being in the Mafia . Not many of course , but still . . . In 1959 one of their number had met Stanley . They had worked out one of the first private offshore investment companysetups to be established in the Carribean area . Stanley Rosen , in true character , had discovered Curacao not too long after the Dutch had , it seems . He had carefully developed the necessary bank connections there , had gained the services of a first-class law firm and a world-renowned , non-American accountancyand auditing company . The corporate structure that had been worked out was as near to perfection as one could get in a world crawling with tax inspectors , and plagued by ever-changing tax laws , currency restrictions , death duties , reporting requirements , et cetera ad nauseam . The Curacao corporation was duly capitalized and received a long-term loan of a very substantial nature . All in-payments were , of course , incash . The shares and notes were , naturally , all issued in bearer form . Under the rather lengthy bylaws , Stanley Rosen had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ residents of the colony  --  to manage the company 's assets on a carte blanche basis . By 1963 Rosen had managed to triple the original cash input . That sufficed . The word spread  --  quietly . In the course of the next five years he had established twenty-seven such entities ; their structure increased each time in terms of complexity and finesse . Curacao had been joined by the Bahamas , the Cayman Islands , and of course Liechtenstein as corporate domiciles . Often two or more of these offshore havens were strung together within one corporate complex , with separate directorships , separate balance sheets , separate auditors . The only thing they all had in common was a managementcontract with Stanley Rosen , or one of his corporationsin Bermuda , Panama , or Luxembourg . By the early 1970s the combined assets of this system added up to a ten-digit number . Rosen managed all of it  --  successfully . Exactly this thought was passing through Stanley Rosen 's mind as he relaxed into an easy chair in the sitting room of his suite . Running over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decision that had led to his presence in Beirut had been taken just two weeks ago , over lunch at Delmonico 's . His " partner , " Harry Stahl , had been waiting for over half an hour before Stanley had finally turned up . " Where the hell you been so long ? " Harry had inquired . " Talking to a new client . " " Talking to a what ? I thought we agreed years ago that we had more than enough to handle . Stanley , I 'm warning you . I 've got my hands completely full now with all the back office work . Christ , you ought to know better ! " " Now wait a minute . First let me tell you what kind of a client . Boy , what 's wrong with you today ? " " Nothing . It 's just that I do n't like surprises . " 48 49 " O.K. , O.K. But now just listen for a minute . I 'm not committed . So hold your horses until you hear my story . All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew his " partner " all too well to doubt that there must be something big involved : somethingthat must interest the bejesus out of Stanley . That was not easy these days . Grudgingly Harry said , " I ordered you a shrimp cocktail and a steak  --  rare , with french-fried onions . " Stanley had then told what little there really was to be told at this point . At nine that morning a fellow , who introduced himself as Omar Radazan from Beirut , had called him and asked for an appointment at his earliest possible convenience . He had referred to a man from Miami who was big in the internationalresort hotel business and a client of long standing of Stanley . At ten-thirty he had shown up . A dapper little bastard . Smooth as silk , polite as hell , about forty . His card had indicated that he was head of the Beirut branch of the CommercialBank of the Trucial States , headquartered in Bahrein for Christ 's sake . It seemed that all of the Arab banks have branches in Beirut . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less than five minutes to ask Rosen if he would consider taking over the management of the investment funds of one of his friends , or clients , or relatives  --  the relationship was never really clearly spelled out . But the funds were . Just over $100 million . At present they were invested in a whole string of U.S. common shares , a sprinkling of preferreds , and a big block of , for Christ 's sake , municipal bonds . Municipal bonds for an Arab ? Initially , Radazan had not mentioned the investment bank in New York which was handling the account , but after he pulled out the sheet listing the cats and dogs in the portfolio , Stanley had identified it immediately . Their record had been piss-poor for years . But they still lived well on their reputation , and the reputations of ex-Cabinet members , generals , and even admiralswhich they regularly bought in competition with other. banks , aero-space companies , and management consultants in the true spirit of free enterprise . Unlike baseball , a systematic draft system had not yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Rosen had been very , very leery in the beginning . He had had enough experience in international finance to know two things . First , Arab money is 99 percent myth , or perhaps 99.999 percent . He had never met anyone who had ever really seen a major chunk of it . Second , whenever strange people start talking in terms of tens of millions of dollars , not to speak of a hundred million , the chances are a thousand to one that it 's a complete waste of time  --  no , a million to one . At this point Harry Stahl had interrupted . " So why did n't you kick him out of the office ? " " I 'll tell you why . Because he offered to arrange immediately for first-class fare to Beirut , and $10,000 prepaid expenses . With no commitment on either side . " This even stopped Harry . " Well , I 'll be damned ! But Arabs ! Do n't they know you 're Jewish ? " " He did n't ask . But what the hell , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have checked up pretty carefully before-hand . " " Do you want to work for a bunch of crazy Arabs , Stanley ? " " That 's just it . I would . I mean , if those guys have somehow developed enough interest in me to make such an approach , well , dammit , I think that 's pretty good . I get tired of lining up broads for most of those schnucks we 've got now as clients . And tired of listening to them tell me for the hundreth time how hard their family had to work to make all that money  --  and to be careful with it , or else . This would be something new . " " But Stanley , how in hell are you going to communicate with these guys ? Most of the people in New York ca n't even understand you . " The conversation had then eased into the usual kidding ses-50 51replied Rosen . " Tell me , what prompted you to contact me in the first place ? " Stanley 's thoughts in New York proved correct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They were essentially interested in what Mr. Radazan termed his track record . Lebanese . " Frankly , Mr. Rosen . We are not interested in your Panamaniancorporations or Liechtenstein Anstalten . We do n't need that sort of thing . We have no tax problems here . What my client seeks is performance , and we have not been getting it so far in New York . " " Something puzzles me , Mr. Radazan . I have had zero experience in this part of the world . But still , I do get around a bit . And I know that performance ' was never really important here . I 've been told on many different occasions that most of the investment funds coming out of here are put either into property or into bank time deposits . Period . And that one is even very fussy about the banks , with the result that such money placements are restricted more or less to the top fifty banks in the world  --  and that the British banks have always gotten the lion 's share . So pardon me if I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waste your time , and I hope you wo n't waste mine . I 'm not a property specialist , and I do n't work for Barclays . " Radazan did not appear at all upset at this show of bluntness . Quite the contrary . " Mr. Rosen , your analysis of the situationhere is quite correct  --  or should I say , was correct until a few years ago . Also here in the Near East things change . A new generation has come into key positions , not just in Egypt or Libya but also in other countries and even sheikdoms . These younger people have , for the most part , been well educated in England or France and have quite an able understanding of investment procedures and markets . To be sure , they are by no means in charge . But they are seeking to promote a middle way between the ultraconservatism of their fathers and grand-53sion . After lunch Stanley called Mr. Radazan at the Regency . They had agreed upon the arrangements . And here he was . In Lebanon , for God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then a nap . About four hours later the phone rang . It was Radazan . He suggested dinner together , but Rosen declined . They agreed that Stanley would get some more rest that night , and that Radazan would pick him up at the hotel at ten . Stanley went back to sleep . The following morning , Tuesday October 21 , Rosen had breakfast on the terrace outside of his hotel living room . The weather was absolutely superb and the view of the Mediterraneanmagnificent . The similiarity to the French Riviera was unmistakable . Radazan arrived at ten on the dot , with Cadillac and chauffeur , and within twenty minutes they were in his office , in what appeared to be a spanking new twelve-storey building , of which the Beirut branch of the Commercial Bank of the Trucial States had one floor . There was absolutely no activity on the premises . Radazan introduced Rosen to a man who was apparently his brother , or cousin , or some such thing , who did not speak a word of English and appeared to mumble a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad that he could not really tell . The cousin had the function of chief coffee bringer . Thick , not very hot , syrupy  --  ugh ! The only saving grace was the large glass of water that came with it . As Stanley found out , it was useless to try to gulp it down , and get the whole damn thing over with . A few seconds after you put your cup down , old cousin appeared like magic with a fresh one , ready to go for the second round . And so forth . " Mr. Rosen , " began Radazan , " first I would like to tell you how very much I appreciate your coming all this way to talk to us . We feel honoured . " " I 'm really the one who should feel honoured , Mr. Radazan , " 52fathers and the legitimate objective of capital gains in the modern sense . " " Fine . But why come all the way to New York for professionalmoney management ? You 've got enough much closer  --  right here in Beirut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or Geneva . " " Well , I can not answer in general ; most of the money from this area does go to Europe . But in this specific case my friend tried Europe but did not get results , or at least the results he had hoped for with his new ' approach . He then came to me for advice . I am a simple commercial banker and not able to run investment funds of this size . So I contacted some friends in New York who I thought would be ideal . You saw the portfoliothat resulted . Within the last twelve months they have managed to drop almost $10 million . And this was an improvementover what happened in Europe . " There was a familiar ring to all this for Stanley Rosen . Investorsjumping from the frying pan into the fire and then back into a fresh frying pan , mistaking motion for action . " So I 'm supposed to pick up the pieces , " stated Stanley . " Quite , " replied Radazan . " The fee we are discussing is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under management , plus 10 percent of the annual gains achieved  --  if any . The exact formula can be worked out to your satisfaction , I 'm sure , when we reach that point . " " Are you in a position to make the commitment ? " asked Rosen . " No , " replied Radazan . " I think that I should make it quite clear that I am just what I believe you call an errand boy for my friend . Actually , he 's my uncle on my mother 's side . He 's in Beirut and is expecting to see us right about now . " " What does he expect to hear from me ? " " Not just blah blah . If you have something very specific in mind that you could propose , I think it would be advantageous for all of us . " " I do . " 54 " Fine . Then I would suggest we move right on . " This speed and firmness of decision could not have been more atypical of the Arab way of doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and months of back and forth and up and down , all with a maximum of ritual and a minimum of concrete proposals . Apparently somebody had done a magnificent job of selling Stanley Rosen to Radazan , and Radazan had done an even better job with his client . As Radazan later related to him , the process had already been going on for more than four months . They got back into the waiting car and moved off . " Tell me , Mr. Radazan , how did you get so smart ? " asked Rosen . " You mean my English ? " countered Radazan . " That and a few other things , " answered Rosen . " Essentially from you Americans . I attended the American University here in Beirut  --  studied law  --  and a few years followinggraduation went to the middle management business school at Fontainebleau . They use essentially the Harvard case method , you know . " " Oh , " commented Stanley , thinking that he had been right in believing that this new client would be a major step up from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was class ! The contrast between Stanley 's thoughts and the scenery outside the car window could not have been greater , for he suddenly found himself in the old Arab quarter of Beirut . The streets were crowded and dirty , the traffic a chaotic mixture of carts , donkeys , unbelievably overloaded trucks : the dress of the people was just as exotic . It was smelly . Much to Rosen 's surprise , they stopped right in the middle of one of the crummieststreets of all , and Radazan indicated that they were to get out . To enter the building that was apparently their goal , both had to almost climb over a crippled beggar that huddled in the doorway . Stanley suddenly did not like this one little bit . Is this just one big fucking put-on ? was the elegant thought55which struck him as he followed Radazan up two flights of stairs  --  very rickety stairs . The only door on the second floor was immediately opened after Radazan rang the bell . A bearded Arab in full desert dress ushered them in after Radazan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the large front office , if you wanted to call it that for want of a better term , similar Bedouin types were lounging around . A seventh , dressed in European style , stopped picking away on a typewriter that appeared at least fifty years old to glare at them as they were ushered through into the adjoining office . As they entered , an almost grotesque figure arose from behind his desk , and extended his hand to Radazan . Radazan in turn introduced the person to Stanley as Ali ben Fezali , his uncle on his mother 's side . The man appeared to be in his seventies , was hugely fat , dirty  --  a nomadic version of Sydney Greenstreet . His desk was cluttered with papers in complete disorder , some of them yellow with age or perhaps camel dung ; others just plain smeared . The desk was huge , but old  --  and for some reason , battered . The only other pieces of furniture in the room were two plain straightback chairs , a small coffee table , and a couch  --  obviously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had dealt with some peculiar principals in the States  --  to put it mildly  --  but this took the absolute goddamnedcake . Radazan took his place on the horsehair couch and motioned to Rosen to join him . Fezali settled once again behind his desk . Simultaneously , the door opened , and another one  --  also in full robes  --  entered and presented everybody with the usual small cup of thick coffee . This time without a glass of water . Fezali began to speak to Radazan in Arabic , and as he spoke it became apparent , that he was a man of humour . His huge face crinkled often with a smile as he spoke . Stanley started to relax . Radazan , in due time , turned to Rosen . " First , Mr. Rosen , my uncle would like to apologize that he does not speak English . When he was a boy it had not been necessary . He would like to thank you for your visit . He apologizes for the lack of better facilities here but explains that he has been using this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does not intend to change now . " Rosen mumbled the usual reciprocal words , and Radazan passed them on . Radazan then once again turned to Rosen . " My uncle has asked me to explain his situation . He is a banker . One of the most famous ones in the entire Near East . In fact , he also owns the bank where I work . " Rosen must have shown his disbelief most obviously , for both Fezali and Radazan immediately broke out into laughter . " I know that this is most difficult for you to imagine , Radazan said , " but it is so . Let me explain . " The story was not uninteresting . Fezali had already inheritedfrom his father and grandfather a banking system which was in a tradition as old as the sands of the Levant , yet as modern as the drive-in-facilities which California could claim as its only important contribution to the world of finance . The Fezali family  --  brothers , cousins , nephews  --  had for generationscontrolled the money-changing facilities in and around Mecca and Medina @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ covered from the burning sun , temporarily placed alongside the road or in the streets . The clientele were pilgrims from the world 's Moslem countries , ranging from nearby Egypt to faraway Pakistan and Indonesia . Mecca represented the fulfillmentof the most fervent prayers of all Mohammedans  --  ranging from the very very rich to the very very poor . They often came with what amounted to the better part of their life 's savings in a myriad of forms , ranging from Maria Theresa thalers to napoleons to crumbled dollar bills . The Fezali family acted as their money changer . They conducted this type of banking with a speed and accuracy which had become legend. 56 57The logistics of the operations were as complex as the bewilderingarray of monetary units in which they dealt . Couriers , armed to the teeth and always in pairs , moved the funds in and out of the Mecca area . The ultimate staging point was Beirut . The means of transportation ranged from foot to camel to horse  --  and today  --  to fast cars and jet airplanes . The rates of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself , Ali ben Fezali , and through some mysterious system of communication extended to the last roadside table within hours . Really very little had changed over many generations . Then came oil , and immense amounts of money which the ruling class , with the best will in the world , simply could not spend as fast as it came in  --  with the result that the Fezali family 's ancient talents were suddenly in great demand . Stanley 's new principal explained it ; Radazan translated . " Suddenly my family had to expand its operations  --  to Kuwait , to Riad , to Qatar , to the Trucial States , to Abu Dhabi , and even to Oman , that desert pestilence . Iraq is not for us . We do not like those maniacs . Our friends bring much money to us . But we learn slowly . We have very simple operations . We have no organized money or capital markets in most places . Even in Beirut things are very small and limited . So we have no choice but to go abroad with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . These were the only places we would leave our money , in London , in sterling at 7 percent . We still leave a lot there , but we have been hurt . Two devaluations wiped out years of interest . So we have tried Switzerland . No devaluation , but also no interest . The Swiss feel that we must be thankful that they keep our money for us at zero percent , or maybe 1 per cent or 2 per cent less never-ending fees and charges and insolence . You know what I mean . " Stanley only knew too well . " The Dutch ? Not bad . But a dull people , and a very crafty people . Born with fraudulent instincts , which , as a result of success , are encouraged as they grow older . The French we have also tried : too complicated . The Germans ? Too German . So , with the help of my nephew here , we finally decided to try the United States . As an experiment . You know , I am sure , that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is very difficult to preserveit , and dangerous to make money with money . The Koran is most wise on this subject . Money changing  --  yes , that we can do . But capital investment  --  that is something we must still leave to the capitalists , until we learn the art ourselves . " That is why we came to New York , and that is why we have come to you , Mr. Rosen . Because we have heard that you are very successful with large amounts of capital . And now , I would like to know what you would do with my capital , if you take over a part of it to manage . " It was Stanley 's turn . He had given the situation most careful thought during the time which had passed since Radazan 's approachin New York . He had developed an idea which , though daring and unusual , still was completely in keeping with his low-risk philosophy of money management . The only real problemhad been timing . And here luck , which Rosen knew was one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have appeared on the scene at just the right moment . During Rosen 's weekend stopover in Paris , on route to Beirut from New York , he had taken advantage of an invitation to a cocktail party being thrown by a friend of a friend in that city . As usual , Stanley had once again wound up leaving with the prettiest girl there . A very tall redhead who , it later turned out , had a thing for short men like Stanley . The broad was apparentlyunbelievably well connected as the conversation duringthe rather long night had increasingly indicated . One of the most talkative screws he had ever met  --  but a damn good screw nevertheless , obviously with lots of practice . But what had hit Stanley like a bomb was an anecdote she had told  --  Stanley would have guessed around four in the morning  --  about her " steady , " apparently a most important Swiss banker . The poor bastard had not been able to come through the evening before , even though he had come to Paris for that single purpose . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fault of the58 59secretary of the treasury of the United States of America , and some other fellow with some international bank in Bale  --  she did n't recall all the details . But she recalled quite enough for Stanley , who , in contrast to his predecessor of the preceding evening , managed to combine business and pleasure very successfullythat night . Rosen turned to Fezali . " Mr. Fezali , let me tell you my investmentphilosophy in a few words . I do n't gamble . I take very carefully calculated risks . I do not promise to make 5 percent or 10 percent return on your money each year . But I can promise you that I wo n't lose half of it . I do n't run either a casino or a mutual fund . I hate major downside risks . I am willing , however , to put money into anything , anywhere , provided the downside risk is measurable and acceptable and the chances of a good profit are better than 50 percent . If I am wrong on the profit , at least the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I try not to work with my clients from behind a screen of mystery . If I intend to make a major move with their money , I explain my reasoning and intentions to them . If they do n't fully buy the idea , I will not proceed . One last thing . I put my own money into the same projects as those which I develop for my clients . " Radazan translated all this for his uncle . Fezali was apparentlyimpressed and in agreement . Rosen continued . " I further feel most strongly that there is a specific time for every type of investment . There is a time to be in common stock and a time to stay completely out . There is a time for property investments , and there are periods when property should be avoided like the plague . There are times when one should be investing in Japan and others when one should be concentrating on Western Europe . I do not believe in spreading risk across the board , since I feel it is illogical to put money into things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they will be losers . I believe that you must search out those very positive situations , and until you find them , park the money at a good solid rate of interest . Goodopportunities do not fly in through the window and hit you on the head . They are developed through hard work . The implementationof an idea demands even harder work . That 's what I get paid for , and I expect to get paid well . " Radazan again translated , and Fezali again nodded his agreement . " All right , " continued Rosen . Once he got started on his favoritesubject it was impossible to stop him . " I believe that I have developed one of these opportunities . To you , it will no doubt sound like bringing coals to Newcastle . Nevertheless , I 'll explain it to you . If you like it , fine . We can do business togetherright now . If not , fine too , and no hard feelings I hope on either side . " " O.K. My idea is quite simply the following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a very big play on gold bullion and against the United States dollar . All the signals are go  --  for the first time since the early 1930s . There have been innumerable false starts on this . And the suckers have lost their shirts more than once . But this time I think it will be for real . The absolute key to success will be timing ; timing is more important in this field than any other investment area , bar none . If you are wrong in your schedule , when the target date passes the only answer is to bow your head in shame , pick up your marbles , and go . Otherwise you just bleed a slow death . " Rosen paused again . Apparently Radazan was having a bit of trouble with the Arabic term for " marbles . " Finally he appeared to have once again caught up with Stanley 's rush of words . " Normally , I do not like one shot deals , " Stanley continued , " but this one looks too tempting . The downside risk is very low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stand to lose a maximum of 15 percent , but more probably 10 percent . If we win , we will quadruple our money within the next two months . " Fezali , after once again listening very carefully to Radazan 's repetition of Rosen 's words  --  all the while with his eyes on60 61Stanley , did not exactly appear overwhelmed by the last part . Through Radazan he voiced his doubts . " Mr. Rosen , for decades now we in the Near East have been investing in gold . To be sure , our capital remained intact . But for decades it brought us neither interest nor capital gains . Only very recently did the free market price finally move up , hardly by enough to make up for those many years of no income , but still up . The younger people in our family , our organization , came to me . They said that this was the time to get out of gold ; to find new and better ways of placing our funds , so that they do not lie sterile for another generation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we sought advice in America . " " The logic was right , " interjected Rosen , " but the timing wrong . In fact , very wrong . Because now , right now , the price of gold could explode . It 's an investment that should bring a sure capital gain , with no downside risk , or an extremely small one . My case is very simple . The American dollar is again in trouble . The reason is that nobody around the world trusts it , because since 1971 it has not been convertible into gold . The American government must do something to restore confidence if the entireworld monetary system is not to break down in a way which would make what happened in 1971 look like a Sunday School picnic . The only solution will be to restore dollar convertibility . That will require a massive increase in the price of gold  --  to at least $125 an ounce and maybe higher . This will then represent the new governmentally guaranteed price for that metal . You can buy gold now for $74 an ounce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we do . After this is over , forget about gold . Permanently . Your young people I understand . But after all these years , they certainly should be able to be patient for just a few more weeks . " One more thing . You can be sure that when the Americans devalue the dollar relative to gold they will also force through - a dollar devaluation relative to the currencies of those countries which have been giving the States such a hard time in the monetary area , like France , Germany , Switzerland , and Japan . Sure , it will hardly be anything near as drastic as with gold , but I figure that at least 10 percent is in the cards . " There seemed to be no violent disagreement thus far , so Stanleycontinued . " But now I come to the heart of the matter . Maximum leverage . We squeeze everything we can get out of our $100 million in cold cash . Money like that talks very loud . And I 'm thinking in terms of what we back home call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $100 million in a Swiss bank . Second , we take out a credit of a matching $100 million , and put everything into gold : $200 million worth . " He was interrupted by Radazan . " You call that maximum leverage ? Remember I 'm a banker , and as one from the Near East I know more than a little bit about gold . You 're talking about putting up 50 percent cash margin on gold bullion . I know 20 percent will be enough  --  not that I 'm suggesting we go that far . " Rosen cut in . " Hold on . I 'm not through . The final stage of the operation is that we go massively short on the American dollar . I figure that if we block all that gold as a guarantee , we can sell at least $1.5 billion short , and maybe $2 billion in the forward market . If my calculations are correct , we would stand to make $100 million on gold , and another $200 million on our short dollar position . That 's not as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stock in the 1960s , but it comes as close as anybody else has managed since . " The two Arabs went into a huddle . " Before we get down to the principle involved , " said Radazan , " I 'd first like to point out that if , and I say if , your theories are right , we would stand to make almost the same money by simply putting everything into gold bullion . If we operate on a 20 percent cash margin , we could buy half a billion dollars worth of gold  --  which , you say , is sure to move up 50 percent in price almost immediately thereafter . Then we would not have to run any risks in the foreign exchange market . " " Aha , " replied Rosen . " I see you 're with me all the way . But you forget one little factor . The gold bullion market is a deli-62 63cate one . Even the purchase of $200 million will push the price up . To try to buy half a billion dollars worth could wreck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a couple of years ago . " " Yeah . And they pushed the price up $15 an ounce in the process . " " What makes you think it will be that easy to sell $2 billion short ? " " Easy it will not be . But also not that difficult . In the forward foreign exchange market billions of dollars are bought and sold every day in the week . Sure , we might cause a flurry in the market  --  but only that . " Again Radazan consulted with his uncle . " If everything turns wrong , how much would we lose ? " " On the gold , nothing . We would just have to take our time unloading , that 's all . On the currency operation , about 1 per cent of the face amount . On $2 billion , that would be $20 million . Rosen smiled . " That 's the kind of game Stanley Rosen likes to play . I figure that if the entire deal goes haywire , we 'll drop a maximum  --  remember , maximum  --  of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well be nothing , however , and it is not impossible that we could even luck through with a tiny profit . But still , we would have a $100 million loan outstandingfor perhaps a half year until we could prudently unloadthat gold . So that would mean , say , $5 million interest . But against that we have a $300 million profit potential . Three hundred to twenty-five  --  them are the odds I like at the race track , but believe me , this is not a race track . " - Fine , Mr. Rosen , " said Radazan . " But that still leaves us with what you yourself termed the most important factor in this type of operation  --  timing . What makes you so sure you 're right on that ? " " I 'm not sure . But I intend to become surer . You understand me ? That 's what you pay me for . Right ? " " And if you change your mind ? " " I 'll come back to you . This is not the only idea I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one at the moment . Sure , I 've got a completealternative program in my briefcase back in the hotel . But let me put something real straight to you fellows . Essentially you 're not buying a plan or a program . You 're buying Stanley Rosen . As simple as that . " Radazan translated all of this once again for his uncle . Then the two of them entered into a dialogue which lasted a good fifteen minutes . Stanley just sat there on the horsehair couch . " My uncle agrees to work with you , " stated Radazan . " He wants us to immediately work out the contract . " Both Arabs rose , and within ten minutes , after an enormous number of handshakes , smiles , and headnodding , Stanley and Radazan were back in the Cadillac . By early afternoon the next day Rosen was on an airplane , with a power-of-attorney over a portfolio of cats and dogs in New York worth just over $100 million , and the usual managementcontract appointing him  --  or rather one of his companies in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Trucial States . For a whopping fee , of course . Stanley was bound for Paris . He planned to spend one night there . His purpose , to use an airline expression : reconfirmation. 64 65The Air France flight reached Orly at five o'clock local time , and less than an hour later Rosen entered the lobby of the George V. He asked for a suite in the north wing , facing the garden , and the hotel condescended to give him one , at the modest rate of only $135 a night , plus 22 percent service , 15 percent tax , and a $10 surcharge , the latter representing rather good value since it was subject to neither service nor tax . Step two in Rosen 's check-in procedure was to slip a $20 bill to the head concierge . Stanley also slipped him the name and telephone number of the lady he wanted to contact . Long ago he had learned that it was suicidal to try to take on the French telephone system without the expert aid of local consultants . It went somewhat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for each local call , but in this instance he felt it worthwhile in view of the millions which were at stake . No less than three minutes after he was installed upstairs , the phone rang . It was jean-Paul , his telecommunications aide . " Monsieur Rosen , " he said , " the young lady is out , but her maid expects her back within the hour . She promised that madamewould return your call at that time . " " Fine , fine , " Stanley said . " Now could you do something else for me ? " " Certainly , Mr. Rosen , " was the oily response . " I 'd like a table at the most expensive restaurant in Paris . " " The most expensive ? " " Yes . " " Well , I 'm told that the Tour d'Argent  --  " " That sounds fine . And make sure we get the best table . For two . I 'll make it worth your while , Jean-Paul . " " Ah yes , you can most certainly depend upon me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arranged . For what time , sir ? " " Around eight-thirty would probably be all right . " " Yes sir , and will you be needing a car ? " " Now that 's an idea . Sure , why not ? " " A Bentley , perhaps ? " " Great . But make sure the driver speaks English . " " Certainement , monsieur . The driver is a friend of mine . " " Now one more thing . I want two  --  no , make it three bottles of the best champagne you 've got put on ice and sent up to my suite around , say eleven . I wo n't be back then , so just have them leave it . Understand ? " " Of course . Should I make the selection for you , Mr. Rosen ? " " Certainly , Jean-Paul . And merci beaucoup ! " With that linguistic flourish he hung up and went to take a shower . Just forty-five minutes later the phone rang again . Stanley picked it up cautiously . " Hello , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that you ? " " Claudine ! I 'm so glad you could call back . " " But of course . Now tell me , what brings you back to Paris so quickly ? " " You of course . " " Oh la la , " she said and sounded pleased . " Claudine , I 've arranged a table at the Tour d'Argent for eight-thirty and I 'll pick you up at eight . And I wo n't take no for an answer . " " But Stanley , at such short notice  --  " " Claudine , I only have one night in Paris . And somehow , I thought you enjoyed our last evening together . " " But I did , " she replied with enthusiasm . " Good . Then let 's make it even better tonight . " There was only the slightest of pauses . " I 'll come . " " That I will arrange also . " " Stanley ! We 're on the telephone ! " 66 67 " I 'll see you at eight . Until then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A couple of hours later , as she stepped from the Bentley in front of the Tour d'Argent , Claudine de Beauchamp made a smashing impression . The exquisite pure white mini , and the stunning pair of legs which emerged below , flashed through the dark mink coat , leaving even the doorman somewhat breathless . Her rich red hair flowed from beneath the fur cape , as she swept through the small entrance hall into the elevator . Stanley , a good six inches shorter , trotted behind , and almost gasped when he found himself enclosed in a small red velvet cage , operated by a young person with white hair sitting on a stool beside the controls , a white poodle in his lap . A large red ribbon adorning the poodle rounded out the picture of superb decadence . Claudine chatted gaily with the person of quite indeterminable sex as the lift moved up to the first floor . She was obviously well known there . In fact , when they emerged from the elevator , the head waiter paused hardly a second before coming over to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was completely ignored as Claudinemoved toward the windowed alcove at the far side of the room , with most eyes in the room upon her . " This is my favourite table , " she said to Stanley , as with great fuss the head waiter removed her mink and eased a chair towardher poised popo , taking most careful note of the target in the process . The fawning bastard , thought Stanley , as the head waiter disappeared without once acknowledging Rosen 's presence . But his flagging mood was immediately revived when , for the first time , he looked beyond Claudine . There , perfectly framed in the alcove windows , was the Notre Dame , its towers and buttressesglowing in a soft light . Rosen , beneath the veneer a sentimental man , choked up for a fleeting instant , for it felt good , very good , to be near so much beauty . It was , he felt , amoment to be remembered , for it was perhaps symbolic of a new and better life which was now within his grasp . The arrival @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for not only were they exclusively in French , but no prices were indicated either . To gain time , Stanley orderedtwo dry martinis on the rocks . " Cheri , " asked Claudine , " are you hungry ? " " Yes , " he replied , " but frankly I ca n't make head or tail out of this goddamned menu . " " Stanley darling , " said Claudine , reaching out to touch Rosen'shand , " that is why I liked you so much from the first moment . You are the only honest American I 've ever met , the only one who would dare admit that he knows very little of the French language , even less about French food , and absolutely nothing about French wine . Would you be terribly hurt if I did the choosing ? " Stanley could not have been more relieved . " Claudine , " he said , now squeezing her hand , " go right to it , baby . " And she did . The delicate filet de sole cardinal was followed by their famous caneton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1959 white Burgundy was succeeded by an absolutely superb 1949 Haut-Brion . The cognac , from the restaurant 's special reserve , proved to be as golden in flavour as in colour . The only deviation from Claudine 's suggestions upon which Stanley insisted was coffee . He refused to touch the stuff . The memories of Beirut were still too strong . The bill proved staggering , but Stanley paid it with a flourish worthy of the Aga Khan . Back in the Bentley , Claudine took his head between her two gloved hands and pecked him ever so slightly on the nose . " That was lovely , " she said , " and now let 's go back to my apartment . " " No , " said Stanley , " there 's one place I 've always wanted to go to , but somehow never made it . I know it 's a bit touristy , but  --  " 68 69 " Not the Moulin Rouge ? " exclaimed Claudine . " No . The Crazy Horse Saloon . " So the Crazy Horse Saloon it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for people who waved $10 bills . Stanley and Claudine ended up beside each other , jammed behind a table squeezed onto a semicircular extended settee immediately in front of the small stage . The din was deafening , the smoke in the room overpowering , and the number of Midwestern Americanswith their plastic wives astounding . " It 's wonderful ! " screamed Claudine , as the music started , adding yet another claustrophobic element to the atmosphere of total suffocation already pervading the place . But in spite of it all , the show was full of electric excitement from the very outset . The flashing lights , the kooky costumes , the gorgeous girls brought the temperature of the room up another ten degreeswithin minutes . The middle-aged woman from Little Rock pressed between Stanley and her husband , one elbow stubbornlyimbedded in Stanley 's ribs , noticeably recoiled when one of the girls damn near shoved her well-groomed pubic hair into her hubby 's rather red nose . The man 's self-control collapsedcompletely , as he broke into a series of violent sneezes . Claudine thought this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dozens of people immediately around them , especially when the nice American lady , with a touch of silver in her hair , turned to her embarrassed spouse and said , in a loud voice , " Henry ! Do n't make a fucking ass of yourself . " The tableaux on the stage before them changed , this time to an African pair . Soon all female attention in the room was riveted on the crotch of the enormous black man , as , with a rather noticeable swelling where it counted most , he began a relentless pursuit of his virginal partner . As the room became increasingly hushed , Stanley stiffened . For there , tugging at his zipper with immediate and complete success , was a hand . Andas soon as he was totally unleashed , yet another hand took a firm hold . " Jeezus , " whispered Stanley out of the side of his mouth . " What 're you trying to do ? " The only reply came from the two hands , which slowly began to move in rhythm with the pulsing drums @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increasingly entangled pair on the stage . As the climax slowly began the approach , the room went into total darkness . The two carefully prepared naked bodies reflected the ultraviolent lights which now played upon them , creating images of dark and eerie sex . At this point the American lady on Stanley 's left stirred . To his utter horror , a third hand was laid upon him . Ever so cagily it had dropped to his knee , as if by accident under the crowded circumstances . But then , purposefully , it began inching its way up . There was n't a goddamned thing Stanley could do but sit there in awful anticipation , since he was totally wedged in by solid flesh on both sides and blocked by the table in front . The rather oversized table cloth which , thankfully , concealed Stanley'slap , started to flutter like a tent in a hurricane , as the confusionbelow increased . He could almost feel the anticipation of the new set of chubby fingers as they worked their way , ever faster , toward the target area @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made with that other set of busy French fingers . But then , with regained courage , they searched for , and found , if not all , at least the tip of the object which had developed such enormous local popularity . By now it appeared to dawn on Claudine that something extraordinary was happening . " Is that you ? " she whispered . Stanley was too paralyzed to reply , but words were hardly necessary since there , right on top of the table , his white cuffs  --  two of them  --  unmistakably reflected the bluish light of the ultraviolet lamps . Suddenly Claudine 's hands withdrew , and with the air of royalty she leaned past Stanley and said in the70 71sweetest of loud voices to the matron on his left , whose hand was firmly clutching its prize : " Madame , would you mind taking your hand off my friend 's cock ? " Which she did , as Stanley went into violent withdrawal symptoms that became even more accentuated when Claudine went on , equally loud , " Stanley , zip up your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that this happened every night at the Crazy Horse Saloon , for not a head turned during the entire episode . The American lady , now primly clutching her husband 's arm , did not even take her eyes from the stage as Stanley struggled to his feet and wrestled his way to freedom , with Claudine followinghaughtily behind . But then her giggles started again , and she could n't stop until they had stepped outside the club onto the Avenue George V , after Stanley , in midflight , had hurriedlypressed $50 into a surprised waiter 's hand . " Stanley , " she said when finally calmed down , " at least you 've got to give her credit for having good taste . Although , come to think of it , she did n't get that far . Poor thing . She 'll never know what she 's missing . But maybe you prefer three-somes ? " Stanley was still too unnerved to either laugh or cry . But then slowly he had to admit to himself that , until Claudine had broken up things , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the more he thought of it , of the very audacity of the situation , the more he began to anticipate the rest of the evening . By the time Claudine and he had enteredhis hotel suite , both were in a state of white heat . But again it was Claudine who took the lead . " I want you , Stanley . Now ! " She flung the mink aside and pulled Rosen into the bedroom . Her urgency was so great that the white mini stayed on until both had reached a crashing climax , which left Claudine  --  all six feet of her  --  thrashing on top of him , as she came time and72time again . Finally she lay still . Then breathing hard , she rose to remove the rest of her clothes . She did the same for Stanley , her hands busy with his body all the time . Suddenly she disappeared into the living room , to return carrying a chilled bottle of champagne and two glasses . " You stay right there , " she said to Rosen , as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 'm going to provide the treats . " With just a flick of the thumbs , the cork flew off . Claudine filled the glasses to the brim , handed them to Stanley , then climbed into the large bed , pulling the eiderdown on top of both in a series of easy movements . She retrieved one of the glasses and tipped it toward Stanley . " Stanley darling . You are such a wonderful man . Except for one thing . " Rosen was startled again . He was not used to complaints in bedrooms . " There was something wrong ? " he asked anxiously . " After what that woman pulled , I would n't be surprised . The bloody nerve ! " " No , nothing wrong , darling " she said laughing . " Just that you would be absolutely perfect if you had a moustache . " " Aha , " said Stanley , relieved . " You mean like your little bankingfriend from Switzerland . " Now he took his first sip of champagne . " Yes . " " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that he turned out to be a total failure on his last trip . " " Well , not total . He at least had a stiff moustache . But let 's not talk about him . " " But , " insisted Stanley , " I 'd like to . Just for a minute . The guy intrigues me . " " How could he intrigue you ? You 've never met . " " Of course not , but what I mean is that it intrigues me that a guy could get so worked up about business that even you could not get him worked up in bed . " " I told you . He had something very big on his mind . " 73 " How could anything be that big ? " " He said that the meeting of those two men he saw together in London could mean that something very very important was going to happen . You know , with gold and dollars and all that stuff . " " You mean the American Secretary of the Treasury ? " " Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was he again ? " " In English I do n't know . But in French it 's the Banque pour le . . . I forget . He called it BIZ or BEEZ or something like that . " Then she paused and gave Rosen a curious look . " But why , " she continued , " are you so interested ? " " Well , I mean he is more or less your boyfriend , is n't he ? " " In a way . But not in any way that has anything to do with us . " I 'm not so sure . I mean , you can hardly be happy with a man who is impotent . " " I never said that . In fact , that was the first time that such a thing happened . " " Sure , " said Stanley . " Now you listen to me . You hardly think that I would becomeinvolved with a man who could n't even  --  " She was obviouslyinsulted . " Claudine , " interrupted Rosen , " let 's change the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's hardly any concern of mine . I just hope that you 'll be seeing a lot more of me in the future than that Swiss jerk . " The fact was that during the next four hours they saw quite a bit of each other , often from some of the most amazing angles . It was just before dawn when they sank into an exhausted sleep . The first thing Stanley did when he woke up around noon was to look at the date on his watch . October 23 . Time to get back to work. 7Exactly six days later , on October 29 , George Bernoulli had just straightened out his desk at the headquarters of the Special Branch of the Swiss Federal Police in Bern ready to leave for lunch , when the phone rang . " Herr Doktor Bernoulli ? " asked the metallic voice . " Jawohl , am Tele f on . " " One moment please , Herr Doktor . You have a call from the Federal Council chambers . " The call was extremely brief . The minister of finance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immediately , if convenient . It was . The quickest way was to walk . Fifteen minutes later Bernoullientered the office of the minister . The latter was not alone . He had two additional members of the Federal Council with him . After the usual round of handshakes , the finance minister , Jakob Gerber , took over . " Herr Bernoulli , please accept our apologies for the short notice . But we have a problem that is quite urgent , and most delicate . I think you are the man to help us . " Gerber gave Bernoulli that super-earnest look which seems to be a prerequisite for high public office , no matter what the country . " Thank you , sir . I would , of course , be most happy to help in any way I possibly can , " said Bernoulli , the obedient servant . " Good . Let me outline the situation . It apparently started in Rome last month , at the IMF meeting . The Germans , French , and Japanese came to a decision that if the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would force the issue by banding together into a gold bloc . Feelers74 75were put out to us to join in , but in view of our neutrality we of course abstained . For this whole project would have amounted to nothing short of an open rebellion against the United States . In addition , I personally doubt whether it could have been carried off anyway . But that is now a moot point . For somehowthe Americans got wind of the whole affair . " Gerber paused . He liked to formulate his thoughts quite preciselybefore speaking . " Well , as I said , the American delegationapparently got tipped off , and nothing short of a miracle happened . The president took the decision to restore the dollargoldlink by revaluing the official price of gold to $125 per ounce . This is extremely good news , of course . And you are probably wondering how we have come to know about it . " Bernoulli had no choice but to nod . Gerber continued : " For good reasons , the president decided to put the secretary-general of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realized that it would be absolutely essential to inform Bollinger in advance  --  you know Bollinger , of course  --  since the BIS will have to assume a good share of the responsibility for steadying the foreign exchange markets , after the announcement is made . By the way , the firmly established revaluation date is November 8 . In just over a week . " Gerber paused again . In contrast to the other six members of the Federal Council , who together represented the collective presidency of Switzerland , he was not a professional politician . He came from an industrial background and was known to be a man who could make tough decisions quickly . In spite of the fact that he had held the governmental post for over two years , he still appeared more than slightly uncomfortable in the companyof some of his colleagues . The associate on his left , the minister of the interior , was best known for his ability to yodel at the conclusion of rural gatherings , which were much more noted for their alcoholic than political content . The man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an ex-part-time university professor . He had no such claim to fame in the yodeling field , or for that matter , in any other . The law required seven men on the Federal Council , and he was simply the seventh . He could , however , smoke a pipe with a certain amount of elan . The finance minister went on . " Obviously I still have not fully explained why we are involved . For the Americans demanded , and received , a pledge of absolute secrecy from Bollinger . Well , an accident happened . Upon his return from London , where he met with the American Secretary of the Treasury , Bollinger put his copy of the gold plan into a small safe which he maintains at his home . This was not all that unusual . Bollinger told me that he often brings documents home , especially over weekends , as we all do , I suppose . In this instancethere was a special incentive for Bollinger to use his privatefacilities . He did not want any of his associates at the bank  --  most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon this document , for obvious reasons . " Somebody tampered with the safe a week later  --  which was the day before yesterday . Bollinger found himself in a most difficult dilemma . If somebody had deliberately taken illegal steps to get hold of the plan and maliciously leaked its contents , the result would probably be the biggest monetary explosion the world has ever seen . Even if the Americans now changed the plan , documentary evidence that it existed would produce such mass exodus from the dollar , and flight into anything else , ranging from marks to yen to lire , from Swiss common shares to South African gold mines , that possibly every bank in the free world , as well as all securities and commodities exchanges , might have to close their doors for weeks , maybe months . It would mean total chaos . I think that should be obvious . The German government leaked their exact thoughts about letting the mark float in May , 1971 . The ultimate result was that in the final thirty-five minutes before they stopped accepting dollars , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would happen under these circumstances . " The room remained completely silent . " One possibility is that somebody is out to sabotage the dol-76 77lar , once and for all . The other possibility is that this is the start of a highly organized criminal effort . You can imagine what this information could be worth to a speculator , or a group of speculators . An absolutely staggering amount . Then there is still the chance that a freak coincidence is involved . Perhaps some petty thief took a crack at this safe hoping for the best and , finding nothing of value , took along what struck him as the most impressive set of papers . For Bollinger claims that no one , absolutely no one , could possibly have known that a dossier of this importance was in his possession . But in any case , it was gone . " After giving the matter twenty-four hours of thought , Bollingerdecided not to tell the Americans . He is Swiss , like you and me . And we all know quite well that for all the good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are not endowed with is the ability to tackle a problem with finesse , subtlety , a fine hand . This is not a criticism , mind you . Just a well-proven fact . As one of my British colleagues has often repeated , At the United States Treasury , every night is amateur night . ' Had Bollinger told them , they would have come storminginto Basel like a bunch of drunken cowboys , if you 'll excusethe expression . " Bernoulli , who knew Americans well , felt that Gerber was overdoing things somewhat . But the minister of the interior , whose closest contact with America had been an occasional bottle of Coca-Cola amply laced with rum , burped his obvious approval . Also the pipe of the minister of justice seemed to be sending up positive signals . The resulting increased density of alcoholic fumes and smoke in the air did not seem to bother the minister of finance . He had apparently hardened in office . Gerber spoke again . " The end of the story is quite simple . This morning , very early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course , and ' asked for advice . I have pondered it ever since and reached the following conclusions about an hour ago . They are : First , we as a country very strongly desire that this gold revaluationplan be implemented as foreseen . It is in our national in-terest . Second , the fact is that the harm has already been done . The dossier is gone . Third , if we take this matter to the Americans , either a disastrous type of investigation will be started , and/or the devaluation will be called off permanently . Everybody , including the Americans , would suffer as a result . Fourth , we do not want any international institution domiciledin Switzerland to get involved in a scandal of such monumentalproportions if we can help it . Thus my decision , based upon these conclusions , is the following : We will try to run this thing to the ground immediately . It may very well be a quite simple internal Swiss affair . If so , we will just squelch it . If a foreign government is involved , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything . In any case , we as a government  --  and I can not stress this fact more strongly  --  have no , absolutely no , knowledge of this incident . I hope you all quite clearly understand what I am saying  --  and especially you , Bernoulli . " " Yes , sir , " replied the young man , " I understand this most clearly . " " But I do n't . " Gerber was startled . Of all people , it was the ex-professor who was speaking . " As I understand these matters , a massive revaluation of the official gold price would mean , ipso facto , a massive devaluationof the dollar . " Obviously the man had hidden , well hidden , strengths . " I suspect , in fact I know , that this will not be acceptable to Western Europe , nor would it be acceptable under any circumstances to Switzerland . " Gerber stepped in again . " My dear colleague , in theory you are of course correct . But in fact , I am convinced the following will evolve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's devaluation completely . They will devalue , relative to gold , by exactly the same amount . So nothing will actually change , as far as exchange rates are concerned . It will only mean that78 79the dollar is once again convertible into go ' . d , at a much higher gold price . This obviously is in the interest of everyone . " " Most countries , yes . But most probably not all . And those are the ones that count . " " Indeed , this will represent a complication . Whether theJapanese , the Germans , or even the British will go all the way is not sure . You know as well as I do that the dollar outflowwas not stopped by the 1971 and 1973 devaluations . They simply did not go far enough . So another adjustment in exchangerates , involving a limited number of countries , may be necessary . After all , this time we want to solve the problem once and for all . " " Are you saying that , for the third time now in less than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ value , relative to the dollar ? " " I am merely saying that we can not rule this possibility out . " " By how much ? " " Fifteen percent . " " Our industry will not like this . " " Nor will industry in Germany , Japan , or Britain . But we must end the dollar problem . And the time is now . Remember , this entire affair will bring a tremendous windfall gain to our country . " " How ? " " We have one of the largest gold reserves of any nation on earth : $3.5 billion worth . This will almost triple in value overnight . It will insure that the Swiss franc will remain as the hardest currency in the world for years , perhaps decades , to come . This , gentlemen , is obviously in our country 's interest . " The room fell into silence . Gerber shifted his attention . " Bernoulli , I have decided to put you in charge of this investigation . You will meet with Bollinger tomorrow morning at eight to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best thing for you to do is to go over to Basel this evening and get some sleep tonight . You have a completely free hand , Bernoulli . But I want you to report to me daily . By telephone , if you please . " The audience was over almost as abruptly as it began . Bernoulli took the eighty-thirty train to Basel . At ten he checked into the Euler Hotel . Before he went down to the bar for a drink , he called his friend at the local police and asked him to start picking up all of the locally known safecrackers for interrogation . He explained the type of job that was involved and the place , but made no mention of the nature of the stolen goods . Kommissar Heinz Bucher promised to keep in touch . Bernoulli turned in for the evening shortly before midnight . At one the phone rang . Bernoulli was awake immediately . " Is this Herr Doktor Bernoulli ? " asked a familiar voice . " Heinz , it 's me and it 's late , " replied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A guy that might fit . He 's just in the process of being booked on suspicion of theft  --  for another job . " " Where ? " " At the Lohnhof . " This was the city 's central jail , a converted medieval convent . " All right , get back to your fellows , Heinz . Tell them two things . First , put the fellow into an empty cell but one with two beds . Second , tell them you 'll be bringing another one along in about a half hour . They should book me on suspicion of forgery with no other questions asked . Right ? And then have me put in the same cell with this guy . And for God 's sake , do n't tell anybody , either the police or the jail people , who I really am . Use the name Salzmann for me . O.K. ? " " Agreed . " " Heinz , " yelled Bernoulli . " What 's the man 's name ? " " Bechot . Sammy Bechot , " came the answer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hung up . He dressed quickly and left the hotel by the back stairs . It took him a quarter of an hour by foot to reach police headquarters . Bernoulli , like most Swiss , liked to walk . It 's supposed80 81to be healthy . Kommissar Bucher was waiting for him outside . The jail was immediately adjacent to the police building . The lockup proceedings were rather dreary . Tie , cuff links , watch , wallet went into a brown package . He signed his agreement that everything was duly there . Then down the corridor , through two doors of steel bars , and into a small room . He was ordered to strip . Disease check . Redressed more or less , he was handed over to a new warden and led up the stairs and then to the left . Ghastly place . Just a line of steel doors , all painted yellow . Why yellow ? The door to cell 15 was closed . Bernoulli was handed two woolen blankets , two sheets , one rather worn towel , a mini bar of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been sleeping . He barely took notice of the intruders . Bernoulliwas instructed to pull down his bed , which was firmly hinged to the wall , make it , get in , and shut up . It was late . Within fifteen minutes Bernoulli was asleep . This was not exactly the Euler , but a bed was a bed. 8The church bells bonged . Six-thirty . A few minutes later the light in the cell was turned on from somewhere , the door opened , and a warden shoved in a broom . Door closed and locked . Bernoulli 's cellmate began unwinding himself from the narrow bed , looked over to Bernoulli , and grinned . " Bonjour ! " " Guete Tag , " replied Bernoulli in the local Swiss dialect . " Aha . Un Balois , " said his roommate , who then continued in heavily accented , though excellent , German . " My name is Sammy Bechot . You new here ? " " Right . I 'm George Salzmann , " replied Bernoulli , " and this is the first time I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lohnhof . " " Do n't worry , " said Sammy , " I 've been here before . You plan to be here long ? " Bernoulli just shrugged . " Do n't worry , " repeated Sammy . " It 's not bad here . But we had better get up . That 's the rule here at six-thirty . " They took turns washing  --  one basin , cold water  --  and got dressed . Following Sammy 's example , Bernoulli folded together his bedding and swung the cot back up against the wall . The only other furnishings in the cell were a very small wooden table , matched by a wooden bench , both firmly attached to floor and wall . At seven the door was unlocked and opened again . Two breakfasts were handed in : cafe au lait in huge metal cups and two pieces of black bread for each . Door closed and locked . Twenty minutes later the same ritual with the door . This time the cups were handed out , and the broom. 82 83Shortly before , Sammy had made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then silence . Half an hour later the door was once again swung open . The chief warden on his daily tour of inspection , continental style . For he also appeared to be chief order taker , and Sammy was ready to order : one transistor radio , shaving cream , three sausages , two large beers , 100 grams of powdered coffee , pickles . He assured the chief warden that sufficient funds were available , even though they had been forceably and **25;167;TOOLONG from his pockets the evening before . Twenty minutes later the action continued . This time it was one of the trustees who arrived with a catalogue from the prison library . An extremely pleasant type . Apparently an American from his peculiar accent . Sammy wrote out a list of thirty books : 50 percent crime stories , the other half Westerns . Thus far the two men in cell 15 had exchanged nothing furtherthan their original introductions . Bernoulli was calculatinghow he could get things moving , when for the sixth time the steel door clanked open . " Salzmann ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Why ? " " How should I know . Come on , let 's go . " Ten minutes later Bernoulli found himself in Kommissar Bucher 's office . " Take a chair , George , and tell me what 's really going on here , " said Bucher . " We had all of two or three minutes on the phone last night , and I did what you asked . But it seems to me that you are going about all this quite the wrong way . You know as well as I do that anything you get out of Bechot in this manner will never be admitted before court . " " I know that , Heinz . That 's not my objective . " " Well , what is , if I may be so free as to ask ? " " I ca n't tell you . So there 's no use to any further questions along this line . " " Fine . If that 's the way it is , all right . " Bucher obviously did not think it was so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the book when something out of the ordinary was going on . " Where do we go from here ? " " First of all , why do you feel so strongly that Bechot might be our man ? " asked Bernoulli . " For a number of reasons . He 's a pro  --  one of the best in the field , with a record a kilometre long . And it seems that he has recently developed some kind of a new way of getting into safes without wrecking them , right on the spot too . He used to leave them so full of holes you would hardly have believed it . But last night another safe was taken , also in a private house  --  on the outskirts of the city . It was the same story as you told me . No marks , no nothing on the safe . This time it was completely cleaned out and once again closed . The victim was an Englishman , a scientist , connected with the chemical industry . Among other things he lost a stack of fivepoundnotes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yesterday  --  at the local station . I got the report shortly after you called from the Euler and immediately put out a general signal to pick up any of the professionals known to us , and in the vicinity . Sammy was the first to show . And although he had nothing more than a couple of hundred francs on him , shortly before we picked him up he had apparently paid for his drinks with a five-pound note in one of those bars in the Rhine harbour area . " " Have you any reason to believe he did the other job , too ? " " None whatsoever . But I think that even you can perhaps detect that there just might be some grounds for suspecting so . " " Thanks , " replied Bernoulli . " When do you plan to put him through the wringer ? " " Just as soon as you would like . But let me warn you . We'vehad Bechot here before . A couple of years ago . He wo n't talk . Not a chance . He 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nail him again , the court will put him away for five years , at least . " " Right . Well , Heinz , then I 'd appreciate it very much if you could give me a couple of days to try it my way . I 'm here under instructions from Bern . " " I know . I know . " " So just leave him alone for the time being . O.K. ? And I 'd appreciate it if you could come and get me tomorrow  --  same time . " " Right . " " Before I go I would like to make two phone calls , please . And in private , if you do n't mind . " Bucher just grinned and left the room . The first call went to the office of the secretary-general of the Bank for International Settlements . Bernoulli apologized profuselyfor not making his appointment , past due now by a good half hour . They agreed to a new date , at Bollinger 's home . The second call went to Bern . Then he just leaned back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now at this point I think it would be fair to point out that George Bernoulli is not in the Anglo-Saxon tradition we are all so used to . Sure , he 's involved in the dark side of state aff airs  --  but not with a revolver , although he 's got one and knows how to use it . Nor with a Ferrari . He drives a standard Alfa Romeo 1600 . Standing at over six feet , with dark hair and a thin moustache , he cuts a very good figure . But he dresses conservativelyand is almost never without a tie . He does not even own a pair of brown shoes . He seldom turns down a drink and never fails to show due appreciation to a good bottle of wine , preferringred wines , peculiarly enough , even with fish . At thirty-four he is not married , but he is never without a girlfriend . He can outski most Swiss and spends a good part of February andMarch in either St. Moritz or Gstaad . Although for some odd reason he had never learned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vacations on or near the Mediterranean . He likes to " fool around , " as he puts it , with archeology . Thus he is a regular visitor to places like French Provence , Crete , and Turkey , although for security reasons he has been forced to avoid Egypt , a fact he constantly regrets . So he is really a rather low-key type , and that is what the Swiss government wants for men in his profession . Bernoulli 's function , the government expects , is that of a quite inconspicuousbackup man to the politicians , as a member of a very small **26;194;TOOLONG force maintained by the Swiss Federalgovernment , an operation that is absolute chicken feed compared with the immense organizations maintained by so many other nations . The Swiss , in this as in so many other matters , prefer quality to quantity . Bernoulli meets their specificationsperfectly ; he has family , education , intelligence , discipline . He is ideal for this particular job . His speciality is financeand economics . Money is extremely dear to the hearts of all Swiss . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world in this particular area is , should we say , out of proportion to their interest in other areas . They like to be informed well in advance of a possible devaluation of the pound sterling , or a decision of the American government to cut off support to some developing country deeply engaged in dam or road construction . This is quite natural , since Switzerland often holds large amounts of sterling , and a number of companies key to the Swiss economy are major producers of power generating equipmentand cement . Filling these gaps in the market suddenly left open by the Americans requires speedy action and often " indirect " government aid in the form of timely information . The Swiss like to think of this as " productive espionage . " Much of Bernoulli 's job was spent at a desk , filtering such information and passing it along to the right place . But he had already worked extensively in the field , where his expertise in economic matters only served as a cover . For quite a periodhe had served with the International Red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The top jobs there are reservedexclusively for Swiss , since after all the Red Cross was a Swiss invention . He had been slipped into the Number Three slot in their financial department . The spot was a good one . Thus , for instance , when in 1970 the Arabs kidnapped a couple of planeloads of people , including one Swiss DC-8 , it was the International Red Cross which made the arrangements to get the people back from Jordan . The Swiss nationals , naturally , were the first to leave . Dr. Bernoulli had done a beautiful job under difficult circumstances , although it did cost quite a few Swiss francs . He was also in Biafra quite regularly , helping out the poor refugees , but also making quite sure that Swiss businessmen were put into contact with the people who would come out on top when Nigeria was reunited . His participation in the aid mission to West Bengal led to a noticeable cooling of relations between Switzerland and Pakistan , matched by a new fervour for India 's development problems , at least two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bangladesh and the emergence of Indian hegemony on that subcontinent . It was not without some regret that Bernoulli agreed to his recall to that department 's headquarters in Bern . In fact , he secretly hoped that he would soon be sent back to Geneva to serve the cause of humanity . Maybe success in Basel would help . And , at the moment , this did not seem impossible . For Bernoulli was convinced that , as Sammy Bechot 's cellmate , he could get to the heart of the matter in a very short time , with just a little luck . But I 've got to get things moving , he thought , as he was walked back to his cell , accompanied by a uniformed policeman , who was apparently not in on the game . It had hardly been necessary , for God 's sake , to put on handcuffs . Or maybe it was just a sick joke of Bucher 's . Not much time had really passed . It was just shortly afterten when the cell door clanked closed behind him once again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barely glanced up as George pulled down his bed and also lay down . " Hey , " said George finally , " what 's new ? " " Hall , " replied Sammy , " what 's ever new here ! " " What have you doing ? " " Reading . You read ? " " Sure , but I do n't feel like it right now . You play chess ? " " Of course . But we need a chess set . " " How do we do that ? " " Watch ! " Sammy jumped from his bed and started pounding on the metal door with his fist . He just kept pounding until the door opened . " Sammy , you know better than that , " said the warden with a big grin . " What are you trying to do , impress your friend ? " " Look , " replied Sammy , " you are here to protect and help us , and we need a little service . A chess set . " " Sure , I 'll see if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no . Now , " said Sammy . " Why now ? " " Because my friend here feels suicidal . I 'm trying to occupy his mind . You prefer to mop up a big puddle of blood ? " The warden looked carefully at George . You never knew in this place . " O.K. Just calm down , Sammy . " Five minutes later he was back with a battered chess set , and left after giving Bernoulli another rather mistrustful look . Nobodyin prisons likes nuts , and a quiet one like this was always suspicious . With a shrug he left again , locking the door with what seemed to be an extra flourish this time . Sammy had the board set up immediately on his bed and soon was deeply involved in his initial moves . He played amazinglywell , and George , who was very rusty to say the least , was well on his way to losing when the door clanged open again . Lunchtime . At eleven o'clock in the morning , for God 's sake. 88 89In spite of the metal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Is the food always so good here ? " " The best of any prison in Switzerland , " answered Sammy . " I know , I 've tried a few of them and heard about lots of others . One thing is sure , if the cops are looking for you , make sure you get arrested here and not in Geneva or St. Moritz . Those places are horrible . Some people , you know , have absolutely no sense of responsibility . They let their jails run down in a way you simply would not believe . " Sammy reached under his bed , and his hand reappeared holding a bottle of beer . His supplies had obviously arrived during Bernoulli 's short absence . " You see what I mean . In the Bale prison you get service , prompt service . It 's also the only jail in the country where they let you drink . " He offered Bernoulli a pull on the bottle and was not turned down . " Aah , " gasped Bernoulli , " that really hit the spot . Sammy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things are looking up . " Well , I 'm glad to hear it . You sure looked worried earlier this morning . " " I guess because it 's my first time . You know how it is when you have absolutely no idea how the system works . " " Sure , I went through the same thing about , lemme think , yeah , about seven years ago . And that was in Geneva . Ugh . Look , just make sure you order lots to eat and drink from the outside . It takes your mind off of other things . You must have money the way you look . What did you do ? " " Bad cheque . And you ? " " Safes . That 's my speciality . They know me all over . Sammy Bechot . The best in the business . " Both men had suddenly warmed to each other . Bernoulli found Sammy to be a highly sympathetic and amusing person . And obviously Sammy felt more than a bit sorry for this man who could not quite cope with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Prison cells produce peculiar social chemistry . In the afternoon Bernoulli followed Sammy 's advice and pounded on the door with his metal cup , and when the warden appeared handed him a list of food and especially wine  --  good wine  --  that he wanted bought as soon as possible . He deliberatelyoverordered . When the supplies came , the bulk of them was locked in a wooden cupboard right outside the cell door in the corridor . The daily ration of alcohol per day was limited to one litre of wine per head . Through some mixup , however , Bernoulli ended up with two litres in the cell . Then Sammy came up with a further brilliant idea . Nothing in the jail rules precluded one inmate from making gifts to another . He banged on the door with his cup , producing a volume of noise reflectingskill born of practice . This time the door was not opened . The night shift was just coming on and security precautions increased . The metal covering on the peephole in the door was swung aside . " What 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wine for the evening . " " Sammy , do n't push things too far . All you 've got is beer and you damn well know it . " " But my friend George wants to offer me one of his bottles . And he thought you might be able to use one , too . " The door swung open . " Not so loud , Sammy . For Christ 's sake , you want to get us all into trouble ? " He turned to Bernoulli . " Is Sammy here telling the truth ? " " Of course . " " Well , fine . As an exception , mind you , I 'll accept your offer . " He unlocked the cabinet in the corridor and two more bottles appeared . He started to apply the corkscrew , hanging from his heavy keychain . " Stop it ! " commanded Sammy . " Just leave the corkscrew here . " 90 91 " You know that 's against the rules . I open the bottles . You drink . " " Ah , come on . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Look , for God 's sake . It 's a 1957 Pommard . You want to ruin a thing like that ? " The warden looked at the label : in fact , he studied it with sudden respect . " O.K. , just wait a minute . I 'll get another one . " " I 'll come with you , " said Sammy . " After all , you 've had a long day . " To Bernoulli 's surprise , both of them disappeared , leaving the door completely open . Five minutes later Sammy reap- peared and produced not only a corkscrew but two cigars , two bottles of beer , and a candle . " Met a buddy " was his only explanation . At nine-thirty , exactly , the lights in the cell went out . Just as punctually , Sammy 's candle went on . Bernoulli and Bechot settled down to a hard night of drinking , mingled with jokes and resulting laughter that at one time invoked a heavy bang- ing on the cell wall . Apparently the guy next door wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when Sammy started talking shop . It was an unexpected opportunity , with such an obviously literate and appreciative audience . And sure enough , when he described his new technique , it elicited a re- sponse of respect , true respect . By this time the wine was gone . They turned to the beer , which had been cooling in the wash basin , under continuously running water for hours . The occasion also called for cigars . " Ai n't this the life ? " asked Sammy . " Sure , as long as it does n't drag on too long , " countered Bernoulli . " Well , I do n't know about you , but I 'm not worried one little bit on that score . I 'll be out of here in less than a week  --  maximum . " " Really ? " Sammy meant it  --  really . They would not dare keep him ; his 92 second-last job had been done for the cops themselves ! One of the kommissars who had dealt with Sammy in regard to an earlier charge , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had set it up , and paid Sammy 10,000 francs for one of the simplest jobs he had ever done in his life . His latest little escapade would be swept under the rug for lack of evidence , and that would be that . This was all Bernoulli needed . To press for more information from Sammy at this point would simply be too risky . With or without alcohol , Bechot was a crafty character . They soon finished off their beer and cigars . Sammy blew out the candle and carefully hid the stump in a spare pair of socks . Obviously he knew his way around the cell , even in pitch darkness . Within minutes both men were asleep , and in fact both slept very well in the sure knowledge that they would not be in jail much longer . The next morning Bernoulli was again collected from his cell for interrogation . Within fifteen minutes his friend Heinz Bucher collected every dossier of information they had on Sammy Bechot . After Bernoulli 's retelling of Sammy 's tale of the previous evening , Bucher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of truth . As the two men systematically went through the documentation , containing hundreds of pages of past interrogation of Bechot , they both had one single objective  --  the listing of every cop that had ever dealt with Sammy . In order to maintain the faccade , Bernoulli was returned to his cell for lunch . When he returned an hour later , Bucher was still on the job . " Heinz , when are you going to eat ? " " Tomorrow . " " Look , do n't take it personally for God 's sake . It happens in the best police forces . " " Yeah , sure . " 93 " Maybe Sammy 's lying after all . " " I doubt it . Why do n't you shut up , so that we can get this dirty work over . " By four o'clock they had the full list of police contacts with Bechot from the past . Fourteen names . As Bucher reread the list for what must have been the twentieth time , he suddenly slammed his hand down on his desk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've got it . That dirty son of a bitch . We 'll hang that bastard up so high they 'll need a crane to get him back down . " " Who is it , Heinz ? " " Probably a fellow named Rolf Lutz . " " What 's his rank ? " " He has none . He left the force about four years ago . Used to be a kommissar in the fraud squad . We worked together quite a bit . Then he set up a collection agency in town . It went very well . So he branched out to Zurich and Geneva , then Lugano . " " That does not exactly fit , Heinz . I mean just because he 's apparently the only fellow on your list who has left the force does not mean you have to jump to such conclusions . " " That 's not the whole story . He did n't stick to collections . Two years ago he changed the name of his company to Swiss Security Consultants . Now the bulk of the business is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want leaked . His success has been fantastic . By now Lutz must have a group of at least fifty people , most of them ex-policemen , on his staff . He moved headquarters to Geneva last year  --  same time as he changed the name . They tell me he picked up a whole crew of communications guys down there . They 'll sweep a place for you on a regular contract basis for bugs , wiretaps , or just plain carelessness . But as far as I know , he 's never been caught stepping out of line . Strictly defensive stuff . " " You got a file on him ? " " No . As I told you he 's been operating out of Geneva forthe past couple of years . And we 've had no reason to investigatehis local operations . " " What makes you feel that he would get involved in something like this ? I mean , there 's an enormous risk . " " Just a feeling . First , I do n't like coincidences one bit . Bechot would hardly differentiate between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terms of us and them . Second , Lutz did not leave this place in a blaze of glory . We all get our hands a bit dirty now and then . You know that . But Lutz seemed to make a habit of it . " " So he was fired ? " " No , but nobody here was especially sad to see him go . He liked money just a little too much . " " Heinz , I 'll just have to trust your judgement , " said Bernoulli . " I do n't have time to wait for a laborious sifting out of the other people on the list . " " But I can hardly pick him up , or even approach him , on the grounds of your story , George . " " I know , and that would be the very last thing we would want . For the moment I really need just one thing . A more complete dossier on Swiss Security Consultants A.G. Geneva must have something . The most important factor is a better feeling for their clientele @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Geneva . " " But do it real easy , Heinz , " stressed Bernoulli . " I do n't want one speck of dust stirred up . " " I 'll work it out . " " Now one other thing . I want you to try to trace Bechot 's movements  --  all of them  --  on the evening and night of October 27 . Check every hotel and every bar in the city . Carefully . " " Right . " By this time it was starting to get dark outside . Bernoulli was brought back to his cell just in time for the evening meal . It consisted of dark bread and thick cocoa . " How did it go ? " asked Bechot . " Fine . It should be all cleared up by tomorrow . " " How come ? " " My father has agreed to cover the check . All one big mixup , you know . I thought his regular transfer had arrived , but it seems that he forgot it , or something . " " Oh . " " Yeah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a little problem like this in Germany a while back . But there we could arrange things without me being locked up . " " Hah , " said Bechot . " Do you think it 's the first time for any of us here ? Once they get to know you they never leave you alone . It 's too bad . Now I 'll probably get some damn Turk or Italian for a cellmate . But that 's all right . They wo n't dare keep me for long either . " That evening they enjoyed another two bottles of wine togetherand listened to Sammy 's newly acquired radio . At nine the next morning a warden appeared to tell Bernoulli to collect all of his things . He shook hands with Sammy , bequeathedhim the rest of his wine , and left . By nine-thirty Bernoulli was back in the Euler Hotel . After a rather lame explanation to the man at the reception desk , he retrieved his key and within minutes was in the shower . It was amazing how quickly one felt permeated with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Bank for International Settlements , was impatiently pacing up and down his living room . It was furnished in Louis XV . Real Louis XV . A fantastic blue silk Chinese rug covered the floor of the living room . A Paul Klee , a Renoir , two Kadinskys graced its walls . It was lovely . Bollinger was a bachelor . He was also a homosexual . It never failed to astound the girls in the bank 's secretarial pool how Bollinger 's colleagues managed to overlook the man 's idiosyncrasy . But his colleagues knew quite well why . Bollinger was probably the most brilliantly inventive mind to appear on the international monetary scene in a decade . While all other **25;222;TOOLONG appeared to be coming apart at the seams , the BIS experienced , if anything , growing prestige . This was due almost exclusively to Bollinger . He enjoyed the absolute trust and confidence , yes , respect , of all the important central bankers of the world . Although he had been educated at the University of Zurich , then Stanford , and finally the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abominable that by comparison even Edward Heath appeared to be a linguist . His background could hardly have been worse by Gallic standards  --  stillthe head of the Banque de France thought the world of the man . The ultimate test of all mortals . The doorbell rang . It was Bernoulli . The two men knew each other on a formal basis . Yes , Minister Gerber had explained everything . " Please have a seat , Dr. Bernoulli . May I offer you coffee , or perhaps tea ? " " No thanks , Dr. Bollinger . If you agree , I think we should96 97get right at it , " answered Bernoulli . " First , where 's the safe ? " " Right over there , behind the Klee . " " It 's rather a large canvas for a Klee . " " He did it shortly before he died . " " May I ? " " Certainly . " Bernoulli took the painting down . It was a wall safe like thousands of others . Nothing special . Probably about ten years old . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his chair . " Are n't you going to get some people over to take fingerprints and all that ? " " No . It would be a waste of time at this point . But if you insist  --  ? " " Of course not . But I just thought  --  " " When exactly did you notice that the document was missing ? " " Just a few days ago . On Tuesday morning when I was going to take it to the office with me . That would have been October28 . " " When had you last seen or used the document ? " " Last Monday . " " Why ? " " What do you mean  --  ' why ' ? " " Well , you 'd had it here in Basel since the middle of the month , What prompted you to look for it , or at it , last Mon-day ? " " Bernoulli , we 're dealing here with highly complex matters and a highly complex document . Do you think I memorized it ? " " Just asking , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in other words , it must have disappeared on Monday of this week . " " Yes . " " Where were you on Monday ? " " I spent the entire day at the office . I always lunch at the bank . " " And the evening ? " " I freshened up after five and went out to a cocktail party . Then dinner . It was all in honour of the Belgian ambassador . He spent the day in Basel and the local government put on a do for him . I was invited along with at least fifty other people . " " You probably came home fairly late ? " " Around midnight . " " Notice anything unusual ? You know , doors ajar that should not have been . Dirt on the rug . That sort of thing ? " " No . I went straight to bed . I do n't have a suspicious mind . " " No ? I thought everybody in the banking business had . No matter . In any case , I think it 's fairly well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ midnight . " " Yes . The question now is who . And why . " " I think I already know something about the who ' part , " stated Bernoulli . " But then why all the  --  " " I said I think so . I 'd rather not go into details at the moment , but we already appear to have some rather strong circumstantial evidence . A man named Sammy Bechot . Know him ? " " Never heard the name . " " Looks a little like a beatnick . Twenty-seven years old . Averageheight . Fairly fat . Long hair , beard . Both dark . Mother tongue is French , but he speaks German quite well , with the usual accent . He 's a professional safecracker . Ring any bells ? " " Hardly . " " We guessed as much . Fine , let 's try another approach now . And it 's extremely important that you concentrate , " stressed Bernoulli . " Do you mind if I smoke ? " " No , go right ahead . " " Let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I am not particularly interested in what you did . I am extremely interested in whom you saw , whether deliberately , accidentally , or incidentally . Anybody and everybody who recognized you or could have recognized you . " Bollinger nodded . " First , who at the bank knew , or knows , about the purpose of your trip to London ? " " No one . " 98 99 " But surely your secretary or deputy must have known that you were meeting the American secretary of the treasury ? " " No , they did not then , nor do they have any knowledge of it now . " " But how was the appointment arranged ? " " Secretary Crosby telephoned me at home to make the arrangements . Right here is where I took the call . " Bollinger pointed at a white telephone , neatly centred on a lace doily , which covered part of the top of an exquisite little side table that must have set Bollinger back at least a couple of thousand francs . " Who lives with you ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my housekeeper , whom I 've had for almost twenty years , takes care of the house during the day . She stays and cooks dinner only if I have guests . She is completely reliable and can not possibly be involved in this dreadful thing . " " I 'll accept that . So no one , absolutely no one here in Basel , knows about this document , nor about the purpose of your trip to London ? " " No one . " " But you must have had some explanation for your flight over there . " " I did give a very good one . The chancellor of the exchequer had repeatedly asked me to drop by to discuss the arrangement for unwinding the remnants of a very complex series of currencyswaps which have developed over the years . I met him after my talks with Secretary Crosby , and we agreed on a most satisfactory series of steps to resolve this issue . In fact , my staff and I have been quite busy since my return with the implementationof our agreement . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Bernoulli continued , " As I understand it , you flew over on the one o'clock flight on October 16 . That would be sixteen days ago . I think it was a Thursday . " " That 's all perfectly correct . " " Now you arrived at Heathrow around two-fifteen local time . Did you talk to anybody at the airport or on the plane ? " " Nobody whatsoever . " " Who met you in London ? " " No one . I rented a chauffeur-driven car from Hertz . I always do that . It 's only slightly more expensive than a taxi and immeasurably more comfortable . I went directly to the Savoy . " " When did you meet Secretary Crosby ? " " Shortly after my arrival at the hotel . We met in his suite , and after very long talks , ate dinner together in the Grill Room . " " Did you continue your business talks over dinner ? " " Yes , of course . But we had a table quite to ourselves . " " You noticed no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Of course not . Otherwise we would hardly have continuedour talks . " " And after dinner ? " " We said good-bye at the elevator . I took the dossier to my room and went to sleep very early . Quite early the next morning I met the Bank of England people , as arranged . " " And you met no one else in the hotel ? " " No one . " " And you recognized no one in the hotel who might have recognized you and perhaps Crosby as well ? " " No one . Well , that 's not totally correct . In fact I did recognizeone man . As we were leaving the Grill Room after dinner , I had to return to the table to retrieve my pen which I had left lying there . Just by chance I noticed Dr. Walter Hofer , dining by himself of all things , on the opposite side of the room . " " Dr. Hofer of the General Bank of Switzerland ? " " Yes . " " You know him well , of course . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other ? " " No . I 'm sure he also did not notice me . " " And did you see each other later in the hall , or perhaps the next morning over breakfast ? " " No . " By this time Bollinger was getting a bit peeved . He had expected that he would have to answer some questions after talking to Bern , but there were ways of going about such things and ways not to . This chap Bernoulli was getting just a touch too arrogant for his taste . But there was no sense in showing it . Just as long as Bernoulli stayed clear of his private life . And so far , he had . But if the Americans got involved , they would grab onto that first thing and never let go . " In other words , as far as you remember , Hofer was the only acquaintance of yours who might have seen you and Secretary Crosby together ? " " Yes , if you want to put it that way . " " That 's the way I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's what he is , thought Bollinger . He hoped it did not show . Bernoulli continued . " Now I must assume that you made no mention of this whole thing at the Bank of England . " " Yes , you 're quite safe in that assumption , my dear Doktor Bernoulli . " Aha , thought Bernoulli . Finally getting under his skin . That 's always good . " Right , " he said aloud . " Now let 's cover the trip home . " " That 's quite simple . After lunch at the Bank of England , I went directly to the airport even though it was a bit early . It was the same story there . I saw no one I knew and talked to no one but the girl at the newsstand in the international lounge . " " Fine . Now let 's take the flight home . " " Well , that was a bit different , " replied Bollinger . " First I met Igor Melekov of the Soviet Foreign Trade Bank on the plane . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we sat together for part of the trip and chatted . " " Where did you have the dossier ? " " In my briefcase , of course . " " Did you ever take the dossier out of your briefcase while on the plane ? " " No . " " What were you and this Russian talking about anyway ? " " Things which can not possibly be of any relevance . " " Ah , so . " " After landing in Zurich I had about a forty-five-minute stopover before catching the connecting flight to Basel . " " And your Russian friend ? " " He went into Zurich . " " I see . Please continue . " " I chatted with the VIP greeter in the Swissair lounge in Zurich . He took me directly to the plane in his car . On the plane I was recognized , greeted , and spoken to by my tailor . He was just coming back from a trip to South Africa . " " Hm . Quite a tailor . And in Basel ? " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my wall safe which you have examined , and retired for the eve-ning . " " Fine . Well , I think that does it for today , " said Bernoulli , and rose abruptly . " Say , do you by any chance know a man called Rolf Lutz ? He used to be with the police department here  --  fraud squad . " " No . " " Have you ever had any dealings with a company called Swiss Security Consultants ? " " The bank does , yes . They make regular security sweeps . I personally find the whole idea absurd . But some of the AngloSaxonparticipants in our regular monetary meetings at the bank insisted . " " You mean the Americans or the British ? " " The Americans . " " You have problems with the Americans ? " " No more than anybody else . " " Lutz is head of Swiss Security Consultants . " 102 103 " Then no doubt I have met him . Why ? " " Just wondering . " " Then we 've covered what you want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Dr. Bollinger . I promise to keep in touch . If you think of anything else that might help , please call me at the Euler Hotel . " They started walking toward the door . " Say , just one more little item , " said Bernoulli , his hand resting on the doorknob . " What could happen if this document is in the wrong hands ? " " What do you mean by wrong hands ' ? " " Let 's say a government hostile to the United States . " " That 's flatly impossible . " " O.K. , but just for the fun of it , what if it happened ? " " If they leaked its contents , it would start a tremendous runon the dollar . No one could foresee the ultimate consequences . " " But why ? " " The world would no doubt interpret the contents of this document as the intention of the United States to make a new massive devaluation of the dollar . They would all want out  --  all at the same time . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is it ? " " Technically yes , but only relative to gold . There will be another devaluation of the dollar relative to other currencies simultaneously , but it will be rather minor  --  15 percent . That 's not what matters . We are dealing here with mass psychology . The world has been extremely edgy about the dollar for years now . This could set off the panic which everyone has been trying to avoid . " " And if it was just a private group , or person ? " " Obviously one or the other could make a lot of money . " " Or , " added Bernoulli , " he could use the document to forwardsome private crackpot scheme . You know , bring on the death throes of capitalism or some such thing . " " I must say , you certainly do not lack imagination , Ber-noulli . " " Well , I 'm not a banker . " With that he left . Bollinger walked slowly back to the living room and poured himself a fairly stiff cognac . Ten minutes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at his hotel . Then he got on the telephone . First to Bern to report in and then to Kommissar Bucher at the local police headquarters . " George , " said Bucher , " I 'm glad you called . I 'm starting to like working with you . " " How come ? " asked Bernoulli . " Because between us things happen  --  fast . We 've already got Bechot nailed . One of our fellows , checking out all the bars and hotels , determined that he spent another five-pound note . This time at the bar of the Three Kings Hotel . It was on the same evening as the robbery . The bartender is willing to testify as a witness . We already have a signed statement from him . " " Great , but how does that help me ? " " It seems that Bechot has been coming to that bar each night , for four consecutive days , starting on Friday , October 24 , and ending on the night of the robbery when he left the five-pound note . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hotel roster . And we turned up enough to make your hair stand on end . First , our mutual friend Rolf Lutz spent four nights there . They overlap with Bechot 's visits . " " It looks like we 're lucking it out , Heinz . " " Wait a minute , there 's more . Five  --  get this  --  five Russians were there during exactly the same time span . I figured that if Bern is involved , this was bound to tie in somehow . " " Maybe . Anything else ? " " The Russians had reserved for the entire week . Last Tuesdaythey checked out suddenly  --  within thirty minutes . Then there 's a fat little American who during the same weekend was waving around girls and dollar bills like crazy . He left some-104 105thing less than the greatest impression with the hotel management . Spent exactly the same period of time there as Lutz . Right across the hall from Lutz . The hallporter claims to have seen them together , very late one night . Finally there 's a Brazilian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the biggest con men in the business . Interpol has had a signal out for him for years . He stayed at the Three Kings for a week and departed Tuesday morning , the night after the theft  --  very early . Tuesday seems to have been a big day for people to leave Basel . " " Great , Heinz . I 'll come right over and get all the details . " As usual , Bernoulli walked . It was a sunny autumn day but a chilly wind was starting to come in from the east. 10Three days later on Tuesday , November 4 , snow was lightly falling as Igor Melekov left the Foreign Trade Bank of the Soviet Union . He crossed the street , against a rather brisk wind , and headed toward the main entrance of the Bolshoi Theatre , less than a hundred metres away . His Thunderbird was once again in trouble . The fleet of black Zis limousines of the bank were there for the asking , but as usual he disdained using them . They had absolutely no style . Melekov @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an important principle . Not that Moscow taxis had any style either . But that was not the point . There was the normal bustle of people and traffic in front of the Bolshoi and five cabs were parked there , the drivers in the usual huddle . But no luck . They were taken . It was just one more of Mother Russia 's unfathomable mysteries . As in New York , the majority of downtown traffic in Moscow consistedof taxis . But in Moscow none were ever free . Melekov did not really mind . He was in an excellent mood . He decided to walk . It was at most a fifteen-minute stroll to the Russaya Hotel . Melekov struck a good figure . He was tall , well dressed , and moved briskly . Going up the rise to Red Square , he had to skirt the usual snaking line of visitors waiting to get a brief glimpse at Lenin 's mummy . Melekov glanced at his watch , a Rolex , and then paused for a moment in front of the showcases of the Gum department store @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russians were never early , and he knew that the Germans took account of every little detail , however minute , in their calculations . He ambled now , through the rest of the huge square , head-106 107ing toward the Moscow River . The Russaya suddenly loomed on his left  --  the largest hotel in the world . Here , he noticed , there were lots of taxis , waiting and free . The drivers knew where the dollars were buried . But , he thought , it 's harmless . Let them do their little thing . Most foreigners in Moscow are much too afraid to fool around with petty black market cur- rency deals . He passed the hotel 's Beriozhka shop and stopped again . He must remember to order another case of Black and White . The shop appeared to be completely full , as usual . It was amazing how all these people came into possession of dollars , the only currency accepted in the Beriozhka stores . One could not help but wonder who in the world had given the original consent for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , offering everything from Heinz soups to Kodak film , and if you tried to pay in rubles they would throw you out . Ostensibly for tourists ; amazing how many of them spoke Russian ! Oh , well , that was somebody else 's worry . Melekov 's worry at the moment was the Germans . Then Valentajn Ivanovich Stepanov . In that order only in terms of chronology , not priority . He could hardly wait until after- noon , and the showdown with that financial nitwit , Hero of the Soviet Socialist Republics . If only the caricaturists of the West knew how close they often came to the truth  --  that fel- low strutting around on May Day , medals and all , had to be seen to be believed . The entrance hall at the Russaya was huge , and it was only one of four with exactly the same design . The hotel had been built as a monstrous quadrangle , four separate but equal wings , each containing well over a thousand rooms . A Byzan- tine Hilton of bizarre proportions . The lines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficult to check into a Russian hotel as it was to check out of an American . But this was also not his problem . " Comrade Melekov , the head of the German delegation is expecting you on the second floor . " Melekov 's waiting assistant led the way to the elevators . After five minutes one arrived . Three giggling American girls and one slightly drunken Russian emerged . The spread of dollars and decadence seem to go hand in hand , thought Melekov , as he rode the lift up to the second floor . The suite which he entered was Slavic Holiday Inn . Now Americans could also travel to Russia without ever having to touch foreign soil . Hans Klausen , managing director of the Rhein-Ruhr Stahlwerk , greeted Melekov profusely in gutteral English . Melekov knew German very well , but he would still be at a disadvantagein that language . Klausen pretended no knowledge of Russian , which was of course not true . Like so many other Germans he had learned Russian the hard way , courtesy of the military genius of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not as good as Melekov 's . So although the advantage was slight , it was there . Melekov had learned long ago never to seek to negotiate in a language he had not completely mastered . " My dear Herr Klausen , my people tell me that all the technicalaspects of the agreement have been settled and that the contract is ready for signature , " said Melekov , as he settled opposite the German on the barbarous piece of foam rubber and steel which served as a chair . " Jawohl , Herr Melekov , " replied the German . He was just under sixty , and known as the most aggressive man in the steel business in Europe . A self-made man . A man with no political opinions . A man who worked day and night , not for the glory of Germany , but solely for the success of the RheinRuhrStahlwerk . " All that remains to be finalized are the financial arrangements . Even there during the past weeks we have worked out a draft agreement with your people at the Foreign Trade Bank , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He handed Melekov a twenty-page document  --  ten pages108 109each in German and Russian ; Russian would be the binding text . Melekov settled back , as best one could with the furnitureavailable , and began to read . The basic elements of the transaction had been under negotiationfor almost two years . It involved the purchase of just under $2 billion worth of large diameter steel pipe from the Rhein-Ruhr Stahlwerk , the biggest foreign purchase in the history of the Soviet Union . The reason for this transaction was simple . Russia 's energy needs were climbing as rapidly as those in the West  --  doubling every ten years . Huge quantities of energy , in the form of crude petroleum and natural gas , were available in the eastern half of Russia . But these had to be brought to the refineries and to industry  --  and they were concentrated in the western regions of that vast country , this side of the Urals . Once brought to European Russia , there was no reason why a good part of the oil and gas could not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was desperatelyseeking to reduce its dependency upon Libya for petroleum . Thus oil and gas could provide the answer to two essential Soviet needs  --  for energy and foreign exchange . Since both needs had become acute , a crash program was decided upon . Intensive calculations , part of the most detailed project planning yet achieved in the Soviet Union , had shown that during the next five years the building program would require an enormous amount of pipe for the dual lines which had to be put in . But they had also demonstrated beyond any doubt that thereafter demand would settle back to a level which just about matched the existing capacity of domestic producers . The conclusion : It did not make economic sense to build up Russian large-diameter pipe capacity to meet a temporary peak need . The investment required would be enormous , and the long-term return highly doubtful , unless a large proportion of output could be sold in world markets in the 1980s . A very expensive study , done for the Russians by Britain 's leading market research organization , proved that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Japanwould preclude this . So the answer was : Meet the unique high-peak need for pipe during the next five years through imports . The problem had then reduced itself to the supplier . Which country would get this big fat contract ? Everybody , of course , got into the act . All ramifications were considered : political , military , financial , technical . But this time , in contrast to earlier deals involving Cuban sugar or Egyptian cotton , the cool logic of the technocrats , who now ruled the country , had prevailed . Reciprocal trade potential , quality , speed , punctuality of delivery , price , and financial terms  --  these were to be the criteria upon which the decision was to be based  --  in exactly that descendingorder . The Americans out of Milwaukee would have won hands down on speed ; the Italians from Genoa on financialterms ; the British on price ; the Japanese on punctuality . But only the German got high points in all six areas  --  first in quality , overwhelmingly first where potential reciprocal trade was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crude that would be offered and pay for it in hard cash , and second in all the rest . The Soviets recognized that Germany once more had the most efficient industrial machines in the world . The country was just one big modern factory , led by men who attacked markets with the efficiency of Prussian generals , supported by engineersand technicians who were perfectionists and manned by workers who had no equivalent for devotion to duty , quality of work , and identification with their company , their products , and the success of both . He was a Marxian nightmare , this German worker with his Volkswagen , his colour TV , his vacationsin Spain . " I see really only one area that does not seem to be perfectlyregulated , " said Melekov finally , breaking the twentyminutesilence which had settled over the room as he studied the financial part of the contract . The German stiffened . He did not like this  --  at all . He and his people had now spent almost seven months of hard work , 110 111haggling over the most minute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been offered any greater responsibilitythan driving a streetcar if they lived in Dusseldorf . In spite of this , the entire 700-page agreement , not to speak of the thousands of items in the appendices , was already initialled , ready for final signature . Except for these last ten pages . " What area are you referring to ? " was Klausen 's response . The man was obviously having difficulty . " The mode of payment . " " But , Herr Melekov , we have discussed this matter at least a dozen times with your people . This , finally , is your draft , not ours . " " I am not speaking of the terms . Ten years is satisfactory . Nor am I referring to the rate of interest . Eight percent seems correct . Finally , I am not referring either to the takedown conditionsor the amortization plan . What has been worked out there is quite acceptable . No , I am referring solely to the currency . We desire that the transaction be made in United States dollars and not in German @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his cool . He did not twitch an eyebrow . " That 's all ? " " That 's all , " restated Melekov . " But you surely realize that this is not just a slight change . The entire credit scheme is based upon a most complex set of arrangements between ourselves and a consortium involving the five largest bank groups in our country . Our banks are German banks . Our currency is the mark . Our product is based upon German costs , mark costs . Therefore the entire transactionmust done in marks . " " My dear Herr Klausen , our banks deal in rubles . Our costs are calculated in rubles . Our workers are paid in rubles . But we adapt to the realities of international trade . When we sell you machine tools , and we have sold many to your company , we bill you in dollars and you pay in dollars  --  not rubles and not marks . When , or should I say if , we sell crude petroleumand natural gas to you after this pipeline is finished , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agreed upon in dollars  --  just as they are on oil transactions everywhere else in the world . " " And who will give us forward foreign exchange cover ? Who will give a guarantee protecting us against currency losses ten years into the future ? " " That , my dear Klausen , is your problem , as you know full well . And it 's hardly the first time you 've had such a problem . But I 'm sure you can solve it . You 're a resourceful man . You know as well as I that you and your bankers in Germany have been deeply involved in dollar financing for many years . Availabilityof dollar funds should be no problem . Interest rates will likewise be no problem . At the moment long-term rates in dollars and marks are almost exactly the same . We prefer dollars . We do 90 percent of our foreign trade in dollars . We do not desire to make such a major exception . " Klausen 's thoughts raced . This is it . Either or . Either this Melekov is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No use stalling . " Fine , Herr Melekov . I will give you an answer at noon tomorrow . If my answer is positive , you will agree to proceedingwith the final signing of the contracts as scheduled  --  at five tomorrow afternoon ? " " Yes , " replied Melekov . " No other problems ? " " None . " " May I call you tomorrow at the bank ? Say , just before noon ? " " Splendid , " agreed Melekov . His assistant , who had been sitting on Melekov 's left during the entire performance was as stunned as Klausen , but his face indicated nothing more than steadily increasing boredom . The fact that he had personallydrafted the final version of the financial side of this agreement  --  in marks  --  and that both Melekov and the bank 's chairman , Stepanov , had approved it was already being rele-112 113gated to that particular compartment of his memory banks which he reserved for what he privately termed Kuriosum . After leaving the Germans , Melekov took the lift to the top floor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lunch . No further reference was made to business . By two o'clock both were back at the Foreign Trade Bank of the Soviet Union . And the first thing Melekov did was knock on the door of the office of his boss , the bank 's chairman  --  Valentajn Ivano- vich Stepanov , Hero at Stalingrad , protege of Khrushchev . A remnant of the glorious past , and a big pain in the ass . After knocking he moved right in with no further formality . " Take a seat , " commanded Stepanov , in a voice which was harsh and raspy . " How did it go ? " " Fine . I 'm shifting the whole transaction onto a dollar basis . " " You 're what ? " " I said , quite distinctly I thought , that I 'm shifting the en- tire pipeline purchase onto a dollar basis . " " Are you crazy ? " " No . Hardly . " " Who authorized you to do this ? " " My dear Valentajn Ivanovich , I do not require authoriza- tion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this bank . " " But I am in charge of this bank . And such a decision is my prerogative . My God , the basic national interests of the entire Soviet Union are at stake . Have you gone mad ? " " I believe I 've already covered the subject of my mental health . As to the rest , I have very carefully discussed this matter with the president of the National Bank . He fully agrees with the new policy . " " New policy ? What new policy ? " screamed Stepanov , who by now had risen from behind his desk and gotten very red in the face . " What new policy , I asked ? " " The new dollar policy , " replied his deputy chairman . Stepanov seemed to sense that something was going on here that could be very very dangerous . He sat down behind his desk once again and started to fiddle with a ball-point pen . " Melekov , I do wish you would stop talking in riddles . " " There is no riddle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repeat it , I am in charge of the foreign exchange operations of this bank . And it is my duty to coordinate all plans and operations in this area with the head of our parent institution , the National Bank of the Soviet Union . After all , they  --  not we  --  hold the gold and foreign exchange reserves of this country . They also control the money supply inside the country . Therefore they set the policy . We manage the day-to-day flows of money and credits to and from our country , according to that policy . I think I hardly need to explain this to you . " " Melekov , I 'll ask you just one more time : what new dollar policy ? " His voice had sunk to a hoarse whisper . " It is quite simple , " replied his deputy . " We have very grave doubts about the immediate future of the dollar . We think it will be devalued again , and by an appreciable amount . We have , therefore , decided to get out of that currency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sarcastic comment from the other side of the desk . " No , not just like that . During the past weeks we have given the entire matter the greatest possible consideration , done enormous research both here and abroad , and reached the conclusion that we must act now , and with the greatest possiblespeed . We are selling our dollars on the open market startingtoday . But it is being done very carefully , according to a quite definitive plan . " " So , you and Roskin have worked out a quite definitive plan , ' have you ? " " That 's right . And part of it is to pay for as many of our future imports with devalued dollars as possible , allowing us a one-time discount of perhaps as much as 15 percent on everything that we have contracted for . The Soviet Union will save billions of dollars . On the pipe contract alone it will come to a quarter of a billion . " 114 115 " And Germany will accept it  --  just like that ? " " They will have no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Fine . Very clever . But , my dear Melekov , just who says that the dollar is going to be devalued ? You ? That arrogant aca- demic quack Roskin ? Has n't the news seeped through to you geniuses that the dollar was devalued in 1971 ? " Melekov sat there . " And now , like that , based upon some crackpot thinking , you and Roskin are going to overthrow a key policy  --  no , the key policy of our bank ? " " That 's right , " was the cool response . " I think Roskin intends to call a meeting later this week to explain the full ramifications for the future to all of us here at the Foreign Trade Bank . " " That is most thoughtful of Comrade Roskin . And so kind of you to give me advance notice . That 's all you have for me today , Melekov ? " He did not wait for a reply . " Fine , fine . Then I see no reason to detain you any longer . I 'm sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Melekov rose and left Stepanov 's office without any fur- ther words . It was one of the most satisfactory moments of his career . Five minutes later he was in the trading room of his foreign exchange department . The action was hectic . His chief trader hung up a telephone the moment he spotted Melekov and hurried over . " I 'm glad you 're here . " " Anything wrong ? " " No , quite the contrary . But I must know where we go from here . " " How much have you gotten rid of ? " " About a billion dollars . " " Who are the takers ? " " We did about $500 million in both Zurich and London . We 're now working on Frankfurt and Paris . " " What 's happening to the rates ? " " Well , we must be putting a lot of pressure on the forward dollar . But it 's holding damn well . We 're being matched immediatelyby takers every time . " " Good . When does New York open ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showed just a few minutes past three . " Daylight saving time in the States is over now , so we 're back to ten hours difference . That would mean New York opens in three hours . " " Right . Try to sell at least another billion in the United States . But mix it up . If necessary do the last part on the West Coast . But remember , keep exclusively to the forward market . Do n't touch spot . And keep the rates coming to me . I 'll be in the office until midnight . " " One more item before you go . We made that transfer of $500 million to Zurich as you instructed . Now what should we tell them to do with it ? " " I 'm handling that directly , " replied Melekov . " But I think you must be kept fully in the whole picture . We 're using it to buy gold bullion . " " You mean that the Swiss government is actually selling gold ? " was the response of his astonished trader @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the free market . " This time the only response was a low whistle . Melekov added , " That , my friend , is for your ears only . Do we understand each other ? " The nod of agreement could not have been more emphatic . And the stride of Melekov as he left the foreign exchange tradingroom could not have been more confident . He was taking the biggest gamble of his entire career . But he was in his fifties and it was now or never . Such an opportunity would not come again . Hans Klausen had not lunched at the Russaya . He had rushed to the German embassy minutes after Melekov had left . That was the only place from which he could hope to communicate with Dusseldorf free of a few in the communications room in the basement of the building . They remained there until well past midnight . The future of the ambassador 's status in Moscow related very closely to the future of this pipeline deal . A sudden collapse of the negotiations  --  just hours before the signing  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by years . He communicated this to Bonn in the strongest possible terms . At one-fifteen in the morning , Moscow time , he had the answer . The transaction could be based on U.S. dollars . The German government would provide an airtight guarantee to Rhein-Ruhr covering the foreign exchange risk . The interest rate to be paid by the Russians would have to be increased by a token .25 percent , however . After all , prestige was always at stake . Both Klausen and the ambassador were satisfied . They finishedoff the bottle of Steinhager shortly after two . Klausen spent the night in one of the guest rooms at the embassy . He was too tired to move . And he needed to regain his strength for the closing of the contract later that day . Not that the signing would be particularly strenuous . But he knew his Russians . The celebration which would follow would last the entire night . On this same evening , while the two Germans sat in the basement of the embassy , and while Melekov was directing the moves of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Foreign Trade Bank of the Soviet Union , his boss  --  Chairman Stepanov  --  was dining at the Georgian restaurant on the Gorky street with a friend . They had met at seven and after five courses , accompanied by much vodka and a fewbeers , they were now basking over the remnants , with cigars and a bottle of cold Crimean champagne . The time had come to broach the subject . " Josef , " said Stepanov , " tell me something . Did the committeediscuss any change in our foreign exchange policy re-cently ? " " No . Not that I know of . I understand nothing about financialmatters . You know that , Valentajn . " " Of course . But was there no discussion about the dollar ? " " No . Of that I am sure . " " I thought so . " " What ? " " Roskin and especially that fellow Melekov are not only working behind my back but also behind the back of the committee . You 've heard me talk of those two before . " " Indeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Both of them . They are like twins in their thinking and in their history ; educated for years outside of Russia ; neither of them fired a shot , or even heard a shot , during the war . They consider men like you and me , Josef , to be Georgian peasants , people who must be removed from the system to make room for academic fancy-pants like themselves . That is exactly what they are trying to do now . I 'm sure of it . If we let them get any further , neither you nor I will remain unscathed . It is an absolute outrage . We must do something . " Stepanov was working himself up into quite a state . But in this restaurant no one noticed . As usual the atmosphere was boisterous . The alcohol was flowing faster and faster as the hour grew later . " What have you got in mind , Valentajn ? " " I think that you and I  --  both of us  --  must approach the committee , immediately . " " But do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There can be no doubt . A grave error is being committed . " 118 119 " Are you sure of your grounds ? " " Positive ! " " I will make the arrangements , Valentajn . " " Many many thanks . Josef . You are a true friend . " The orchestra , seated on the balcony against the background of a wildly colourful mural depicting the Alpine-like scenery of that corner of Russia so dear to the hearts of the majority of guests , struck up another tune with slightly off-key gusto . The two men decided that another bottle of champagne was in order , with just a touch of vodka on the side. 11The next morning in Zurich the banks started their foreign exchange operations as usual . On this Wednesday , business was brisk , as usual ; rumours were flying , as usual . And the Swiss were making money , as usual , in what many people regard as the most difficult of financial markets . Foreign exchange comes natural to the Swiss , and for many years they have been exploitingthis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unusual talent stems from that fact that almost every Swiss is somehow involved in foreign exchangetransactions from a very early age . Living in a small country in the center of Europe , no Swiss is ever more than a hundred miles from some border  --  that of France , Germany , Austria , or Italy  --  and the rates of exchange between the Swiss franc and those of these neighbouring countries are as familiar a fact as the price of gasoline is to the average American , or the cost of a pint of beer to a Welshman . In fact , many a Swiss will be able to quite readily tell you the price of gasoline in all of his neighbouring countries , expressed in terms of Swiss francs or even dollars if you like , since , with his built-in frugality , he will always calculate very carefully whether he should fill up his tank at home , or abroad , when he sets out on a Sunday drive across the border with his well-polished automobile . In other words , he goes through constant and sometimescomplex foreign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life . Take , for instance , a citizen of Basel . This second-largest city in Switzerland borders immediately upon both France and Germany . It is quite natural for a Balois to go shopping in Germany , just across the border , in the afternoon , seeking bargains in the supermarkets , and then go over to France for dinner in the evening , attracted especially by the price and quality of the wine . He does not go back and forth to the bank twice a day buying the required German marks or French francs . No , he just keeps their separate corn- partments in his billfold  --  one for each of the three currencies which are part of his everyday life . What is unique about Switzerland is that they play all cur- currencies against all other currencies . By contrast , in London , for example , the foreign exchange market is almost totally re- stricted to pound sterling  --  U.S. dollar transactions . In New York , it is the dollar 's price in terms of sterling , the German mark , the Japanese yen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But in Zurich , they will be juggling yen against pounds , German marks against Dutch guilders , Swiss francs against Italian lire , and work out a fair price for black-market rubles against the U.S. dollar . They will quote you a price on the Iranian rials , including the cost of picking them up in cash form in Teheran , and converting them into Swiss francs for deposit in Geneva under a number or a phony name . The nerve center of these operations are the foreign ex- change trading departments of the major Swiss banks , always a very large room , packed with communications equipment . The traders  --  up to a dozen of them  --  sit around an oval-shaped desk of immense proportions . Each man has two telephones at his disposal , often three . Each phone has at least six separate outside lines . Thus each trader can literally be talking to a large number of people at the same time . On telephone one , line two , he may have a customer in Hong Kong . On telephone two , line four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bank in Frankfurt . On the same telephone , line six , he may have his counterpart in the bank 's branch in London on a standby basis . On telephone three , line one , he could have a money broker in Geneva . And three or four other lines might be flashing , as incoming calls stack up . The trader plays his telephones like an electronic organ  --  pushing keys , pulling stops , and creating quite a bit of noise in the process as he yells , and even screams , his instructions . The cacophony is added to by the constant clattering of Telex machines which line the walls of the huge room  --  often a dozen machines , all banging out information on market conditions from the various financial capitals of the world , or bringing in confirmations of transactions just completedminutes ago by telephone . Girls scurry around , tearing off urgent messages and placing them in front of the trader involved , who barely glances at them during telephone calls , signs his O.K. , and passes them back . It often takes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ millions of dollars . On the wall is a scoreboard , resembling those we are so used to from sports arenas . Prices of all major currencies , in terms of Swiss francs , are constantly being posted electronically  --  in line with the latest trades  --  thus keeping everyone in the room informed . Very quietly , in a corner , three other men pore over long sheets of paper . They post the so-called position sheets . Each trade is immediately entered , allowing the chief of the department to tell at a glance the net position of the bank . In one hour from opening , his traders might have sold $200 millionand bought $210 million  --  leaving the bank a net position of $10 million . He tries to keep the two figures in close balance , unless of course he receives instructions to the contrary from the big guys . It was into just such an atmosphere that Dr. Walter Hofer walked on the morning of November 5 . He was accompanied by a young lady of perhaps twenty-two or twenty-three . In spite of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room . It was unusual enough for the chairman of the General Bank of Switzerland to appear in the foreign exchange trading room . But to see him there , with a well-built young blondethatwas an event to be cherished , every minute of it . Hofer walked directly to the chief trader . " Herr Zimmerer , I would like to introduce Miss Mary Rogers . " He spoke in English . " She is with a newspaper in LosAngeles and would like to learn a little about your operations . Miss Rogers is the daughter of my wife 's sister who , as you probably do not know , has been living in the States for the last thirty years . So please take good care of her . When you 're finished , I would appreciate it if you could bring her up to my office . I would like to have a few words with you before the morning is over . " " With great pleasure , sir , " replied Zimmerer , as Hofer turned and left as abruptly as he had come . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my account . I know you must be very busy , " said the petite Miss Rogers , five feet two , with blue eyes to go along with her long blonde hair and a bosom which could not be totally overlooked , even if she was the big boss 's niece . " No trouble at all , " mumbled Zimmerer , thinking oh my God and on a morning like this . The Swiss never have learned how to mix business with pleasure during working hours except at the highest echelons . " Uncle Walter insisted I come into his bank today to look around , and he thought that this might be one of the most interestingspots . I know really nothing about the foreign exchangebusiness . But I have worked on the business section of our paper for over two years now and am not totally ignorant . My mother and I are spending a week here in Zurich . It sure is a lovely city at this time of year . Are you from here ? " " Yes , " replied Zimmerer . A man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Zimmerer , the Deutsche Bank in Stuttgart wants $25 million spot at 3.40 flat . " " Sell ' em . Then everybody stop all trades . I want to know our exact positions to the franc in every currency within ten minutes . So hang up the phones and recheck everything . " If he was to see Hofer , he wanted to know exactly where the department stood , right up to the minute . Then another call . " Hey , Zimmerer , it 's Kellermann . He wants you right now . I 'll switch him to your phone  --  line five . " Zimmerer picked up the phone , made a few notes , and hung up . Turning back to Mary Rogers he said , " At the risk of oversimplifyingthings , why do n't I start by explaining what we 're doing here , and then give you an idea of how we do it . Would that be all right ? " She nodded . " Good . I think the closest thing in your experience to our foreign exchange market here would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wheat or soybeans , and many other similar products . There , like here , the market is split : they deal in what they call actuals ' when the real product is changing hands right there and then , and they talk about futures ' when a deal is made involving the delivery of the product at some time in the future  --  maybe in a month , three months , or even a year . Well , in foreign exchange it 's the same . We call the here and now transactions , where the product changes hands immediately in cash form , the spot market . Just think of it as where money changes hands on the spot . We call the futures market the forward market , and here also we deal for months or even years in advance of the actual closing of the transactions . But instead of agricultural products , the productsin which we deal are different currencies  --  German marks , American dollars , Japanese yen  --  all of which have constantly changing prices depending upon supply and demand for them . Follow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now since we are in Switzerland , we usually go out from the Swiss franc . I mean , we usually price all the ' products ' we deal in in terms of Swiss francs . Quite normal , I t h ink . " Again Mary nodded . " Are you sure I 'm not boring you ? " asked Zimmerer . " Oh no , please go on . It 's just fascinating . " I 'll bet , thought Zimmerer , but plunged on anyway . " Right . Now let 's take the American dollar . As you just heard124 125 that fellow yell from across the room , we are buying dollars at the spot rate of 3.40 francs . This can change from minute to minute , but the ultimate range is established by the govern- ment . The most ' francs you can get for a dollar , under the rules agreed to in Switzerland in spring , 1973 , is 3.4535 . And the least ' you can get is 3.3015 . That 's what we call the upper and lower intervention points @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like crazy and it goes down to 3.25 ? " asked Mary . " It ca n't . The Swiss government , through the National Bank , is obligated to buy dollars for Swiss francs at the 3.3015 limit and to keep supplying the market with Swiss francs , taking out dollars , until the market trend reverses itself . " " Why ? " " Because the world has agreed to maintain fixed exchange rates  --  well , almost fixed , since as you see they can vary 4.5 percent within the band agreed upon . Without fixed rates , no- body in business or banking could plan ahead in international transactions . I mean , some Swiss watchmaker might sell a mil- lion dollars worth of watches in the States . But he might first get paid in dollars after three months . If he could not be sure of approximately how many francs this would give him , when he exchanged them , he would face enormous risks . After all , he pays his workers and suppliers in francs , not dollars . Right ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were n't they ? " " They were . But this happens quite seldom . " " But it happened . " " Right . And the Swiss watch exporters got smashed , at least those who had not protected themselves in the forward foreign exchange market . " " Now I 've heard about that , " said Mary , " but I do n't under- stand how you can do that . " " O.K. but you 'll have to follow closely , " replied Zimmerer . " Now let 's stick with that watchmaker . He knows that he 's going to be paid a million dollars in three months , so  --  if he 's smart  --  he 'll come to us and sell these dollars in advance . " " Can you do that ? " " Sure . That , in fact , is what this whole business is about . " " You mean he 's selling something that he has n't even got yet ? " " Absolutely right . It works like this . We , his bank , make an agreement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bank  --  which says in effect : We , General Bank of Switzerland , promise to deliver to you $1 million U.S. in three months . You , Chase Manhattan , promise to pay us 3.35 million francs for these dollars , upon delivery . You 'll notice that the dollar sells at a small discount on the current spot rate of 3.40 when it 's done on a three months forward basis . That 's because the marketfeels that it is probable that the dollar will weaken slightly in the period ahead . It 's been abnormally strong in recent weeks . " " So then when the Swiss watchmaker finally gets his dollars , he knows exactly how many francs he 's going to get for them . " " Exactly , otherwise he would take a risk , as I mentioned before . " " But if he did not sell his dollars forward , ' as you put it , he might have gotten more francs in the end . I mean , nobody can guarantee that the dollar will weaken . " " Absolutely correct . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to , say 3.45 after three months , he could sell his dollars then and get 3.45 million francs  --  or exactly 100,000 more than he will get by selling them ahead of time . That 's the cost of insurance . " " I know you wo n't believe this quite , but really I now start to understand this business . It 's not so complicated , is it  --  I mean , not when a man like you explains it . Tell me , how did you ever get into this fascinating business ? " " My uncle . I 've got one , too , and he 's a friend of your uncle . Ile might even have known your mother , come to think of it . I 'll ask him . Anyway , I started at the General Bank about ten years ago , and after being trained in about ten different de-126 127partments , I chose this one for a career . I like it very much . " " Can girls do this , too ? " " Well , there 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know , it 's still a little bit different than in the States . " " Oh , I know . My mother told me . That 's why she left . " " Maybe , Miss Rogers , we should try to finish our discussion on foreign exchange , " said Zimmerer , glancing at his watch . " But I really do n't want to keep you if you have important things to do . " " No , no . Now , do you have any questions ? " " Well , just one and then I 'll leave you alone . What about all those currency speculators we always read about ? I mean , they 're hardly involved in the watch business . " " No , Miss , they 're really just gamblers , gambling normally on a devaluation of a currency . It 's gotten to be very big businessduring the past five years . Lots of Americans are in it now , especially the big multinational corporations . " " How do they do it ? " " I 'll explain . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office . O.K. ? " " O.K. " " Fine . Well , let 's say that I 'm going to speculate on another devaluation of the dollar , and I think it 's going to happen within three months . A devaluation means that the old fixed rates  --  remember ?  --  will be changed between the dollar and the Swiss franc , suddenly and overnight , and thereafter the dollar will be much cheaper in terms of Swiss francs . Right ? " Good . So our speculator comes to us and we sell , for his account , $10 million three months forward  --  dollars that he does not have . Selling short is the term used for this type of operation . So again we make a contract : We , General Bank of Switzerland , promise to deliver to you , Chase Manhattan , $10 million U.S. in three months . You , Chase Manhattan , promise to pay us 33.5 million Swiss francs for these dollars , upon delivery . We make a separate little agreement with our speculator , informing him that we are doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and at his risk . O.K. , let 's say that a 15 percent devaluation of the dollar takes place . Overnight the spot exchange rate would drop to , say , 2.90 to the dollar . When the three months are up , we go into the market  --  the spot market  --  and buy the $10 million which our speculator never had in the first place . This $10 million would now , after devaluation , cost us only 29 million Swiss francs . Follow me ? Good . But then , literally one or two minutes later , we would present this $10 million we just bought to Chase Manhattan for delivery on that forward contract we had made with each other three months earlier . Chase , on the conditions of that agreement , would have to pay us 33.5 million Swiss francs . Right ? So our friendly speculator has just made himself 4.5 million Swiss francs . Let me repeat , he presold dollars he did not have for 33.5 million Swiss francs , but the cost of these dollars , after devaluation , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gee . " " Yeah , and the beauty of it is that if this speculator is a good customer of ours otherwise , he would not even have to put tip any margain , or deposit , on this foreign exchange forward contract . At least as long as he had a couple of million in the bank or was known to us as a very solvent person . " " But why not ? " " Because it 's quite obvious that a strong currency like the Swiss franc would never be devalued . It 's almost 100 percent backed by gold . Thus , it would hardly ever rise above 3.4535  --  the intervention point at which the Swiss government must step in . If our speculator met the worst of all possible conditionswhen the three months were up , he would have to cover at this rate . Then his $10 million would cost , 34.535 million francs , but he would only get 33.5 million from Chase . So he 'd be out 1,035,000 francs , or about $300,000 . Big clients swallow such losses without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a loss would occur . What the system does is give a government guarantee to speculators , which allows him to calculate to the last penny his greatest possible loss , while128 129on the other hand , it allows him to make enormous profits  --  which can be ten times larger than the maximum possible loss . That 's why speculation in foreign exchange has become such a popular sport . As one American put it to me last week , It 's the best game in town . ' And that 's why we , as a bank , run very little risk when we do such transactions for our clients , even when very large numbers are involved . " " And you say Americans can also do this ? " " Why not ? Of course , lots of people think that it 's not very nice to speculate against your own currency , and in recent years it 's the dollar that has always been getting into trouble . But I 've been told that American multinational corporations cleaned up about $3 billion profits on their foreign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1973 . I guess a lot of people figure , correctly , that what 's good for General Motors must be good  --  period . " " Do you also speculate for the bank , Mr. Zimmerer ? " " Well , we 're actually not supposed to talk about that . You know , then it starts that gnomes of Zurich ' thing all over again . Better ask your uncle . " " Zimmerer ! " Another interruption came from across the vast trading circle . " Foreign Trade Bank Moscow . On the Telex again . They 're offering to sell $50 million three months forward this time . Shall I give them a rate ? " " No . First , I want the positions . Tell them we 've stopped trading for an hour . They should come back then . " He turned back to the young lady . " Miss Rogers , would you mind taking a chair . I have to get some figures together for your uncle . I 'll be with you in a few minutes . " And he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk a lot longer to you , but I think your uncle is probably waiting for us . " " That 's all right . I think some of this stuff is getting a little too complicated for me anyway . " They began walking toward the door when Zimmerer tookMary 's arm . " Say , would you like to look at just one other place real quick ? " " Sure , " she replied . " What is it ? " " Well , it 's another part of our department  --  the gold bullion trading section . " " Oh yes , that would be just fascinating . " " Do n't expect to see any gold bars or anything like that . " They entered another room . It was not nearly as large as the foreign exchange trading center . Only three men were at telephones and three others were obviously doing clerical work . " What 's the morning fixing ? " " 74.25 an ounce . " " How much volume this morning ? " " Quite a bit . Somebody 's stirring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Well , we 'll have to stir it up a bit more . Kellermann just called me . He 's got a very big order for a private client  --  to buy $200 million in bullion . " " Wow . Who is it ? " " Do n't know . A numbered account . Kellermann said he would send down the written order after lunch , but we can start now . There are no limits . Just buy at the market . But for God 's sake , be careful . We do n't want this to get around . Say , I 'd like to introduce you to Mary Rogers . She 's Dr. Hofer 's niece . Maybe you could explain what this is all about . " Zimmerer turned to one of the other traders while the explanationwas going on . As usual it started with the prices chalked on a big blackboard . They indicated the so-called morning and afternoon fixings of the gold bullion price , in London and in Zurich , during the past days and weeks . The world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in fact , unique , fashion . In both financial centers , at almost exactly the same time of day  --  ten in the morning and three in the afternoon  --  theworld 's chief gold dealers sit down , four in Zurich and five in London , to compare the buy and sell orders which130 131have come in prior to the meetings . Then they " fix " a price at which all the deals are made . If there is an excess demand , they bump the price up and meet the excess from their own stocks of gold . If an oversupply of sell orders results , they mark the gold price down and replenish their own inventory . They act as the middlemen in all gold transactions . And , of course , they always rig a nice spread between what they buy at and what they sell for . Often , as a result of five minutes ' work , between ten and ten-five they will make millions of dollars in profits , by just matching large buy and sell orders and taking their slice in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merchant banks , who control this market . Of course , Winthrop 's was one of them , and in fact , it was said that since many years they have really controlled things in the London gold pool . In Zurich it was the General Bank of Switzerlandwho called the shots in the gold game , due to the fact that it was they , and especially their clients , who accounted for the largest part of the volume . Not that they ever revealed what the volume of gold trading was on any day , or even during any month or year . Among themselves , the banks in London and Zurich had decided that such knowledge would contribute nothing to orderly trading , and that the speculators of the world should be protected from any unnecessary worries which might arise from their having anything better to go on than rumour . But Mary did n't know this . " How much gold do you buy and sell here each day ? " " I 'm afraid I ca n't tell you . It 's one policy of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trader 's answer . " Can you give me a hint ? " " Well , in recent years the amount of new gold , coming from the mines in South Africa and sometimes Russia , amounts to about 40 million ounces . At recent prices , that 's almost $3 billiona year . But then you must remember that there are about another 200 million ounces in the hands of private speculators  --  in Switzerland , or France , or the Near East especially  --  and they are constantly buying and selling . So that might give anotherten billion changing hands each year . Some put it a lot higher  --  a whole lot . " " And all that business is done from this little room ? " was Mary 's response . " No . But let 's say this : we do more than our fair share , by quite a bit . And that 's thanks to your uncle . He probably knows more about gold than anyone in the world today . He knows everybody in the business too  --  from South African mine operatorsto the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Dubai on the Persian gulf . By comparison , that fellow Goldfinger in the James Bond book was nothing . " " I did n't know that . " Zimmerer now broke in . " Please , Miss Rogers , for goodness sake do n't mention any of this to him . He does n't like publicity of any kind  --  especially where gold is concerned . " All of a sudden Zimmerer seemed to be in a hurry . He said a few words in Swiss German to the men at the gold-trading desk and then left with Mary . After taking the elevator up three floors they entered a quite different world . The clatter and confusion of the foreign exchange department was suddenlyreplaced by the complete silence of a deeply carpeted , soundproof corridor . A uniformed guard rose to greet them after they had taken just a very few steps . " Dr. Hofer is expecting us , " said Zimmerer . The eyebrows of the guard rose just slightly . " This is his niece . " They fell back to normal . Dr. Hofer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the soft paintings , the huge rugs , and even the very faint scent of cigar smoke which must have represented the lingering memory of Cuba 's best . They crossed the room towardHofer 's desk  --  he never greeted anyone at the door to his office but merely signaled them in by means of an electric " Please enter " signal outside his door  --  and were waved toward a group of chairs that was about twenty yards away , on the other side of the room . The two young people waded through132 133the rugs and sat down . Neither dared to talk at first , but it seemed that Mary 's nature could not stand that for long . " You know , Mr. Zimmerer , you 're awfully young to have such a position at the bank . Are you married ? " " No , Miss Rogers , I guess I 've been too caught up in my work to get around to that . " " Oh , come on now . You can call me Mary , you know . " " Fine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very stern name . " " Well , it 's rather common in Switzerland . " " Werner , do you know any nice place to go dancing in Zurich ? You know my uncle ; my aunt is no different . And Mom is hopeless . So I can hardly ask them . " " Sure , there are lots of places . But it depends on what you want . I mean like everywhere , I guess , you have to be a little choosey . " " I 've got an idea , " said Mary . " Why do n't we two go out somewhere together this evening . Maybe a place where we can have dinner and then dance . I 'll treat . I mean , if you 're not too busy or something . After all , I do owe you something after this morning . " Zimmerer thought . Very nice long hair , cute little nose , and she sure looks great in that white blouse and blue skirt . Probablyhave to be careful though . He decided . " I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you sure your uncle wo n't mind ? " " Of course not . After all , I am twenty-two . " " Are you staying at his place ? " " Yes , but that 's way down the lake . Ca n't we meet somewhereso you do n't have to go out and back ? " " No . That 's no trouble . What time should I pick you up ? " " Would seven be all right ? " " Perfect . " The deal was cinched . The career prospects of Herr Zimmererhad suddenly taken on a new dimension . And after afull week  --  no , eight days  --  of nothing , Mary 's rather active sex life was suddenly returning to normal . This would be her first Swiss . She had noticed that generally they were rather short , compared to American boys . But maybe that did not make any difference . " Well , Mary , how did it go ? " asked her uncle who had suddenly joined them , interrupting their introspective silence . " Just fine , Uncle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business . " " Good . Your mother 's waiting downstairs . I 'll take you . Herr Zimmerer , please wait here for a few minutes , if you do n't mind . " Mary solemnly shook hands with Zimmerer , winked at him , and disappeared . A few minutes later Dr. Hofer returned . " Herr Zimmerer , I 'm glad we have this chance to talk to each other in privacy . I hear that there is a bit of commotion at the foreign exchange desk this morning . What 's going on ? " " Herr Doktor , it 's really too early to say . But there 's big volume and some downward pressure on the dollar again . " " Where 's it coming from ? " " Hard to say . " " Any unusually big sellers ? " " Really only one that we 've noticed . The fellows in Moscow . They were very big on the selling side yesterday , and they 're back at it again today . " " For this time of year that is peculiar . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late fall to pay for agricultural imports , if I recall correctly . " " That 's right , sir . But , of course , this selling could very well be just concentrated on us for the moment . They might just be doing a lot of trading , playing us off against Frankfurt or London , or more probably Budapest , Bucharest and Prague . All those fellows in Eastern Europe have gotten very big in the foreign exchange game during the past couple of years . Would you like me to check all this out in detail to see if something really unusual is going on ? " 134 135 " Yes . Please do , Zimmerer . But do it carefully . And do not mention any of this to your associates . Now another thing . What 's our net dollar position ? " " I have brought the latest figures with me , sir . Right now we are slightly short , on balance . About $40 million . That 's well within the standing limits I 've been given , sir , for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Hofer paused and then went on . " Right . Now I want you to adjust our dollar position very carefully . From short to much shorter . You have authorization to go up to two billion short  --  as quickly as the market will take it . Stick to short maturities  --  three months maximum . " " You mean $2 billion or Swiss francs equivalent ? " " Dollars . " " You said , as quickly as the market will take it . Do you mean today ? " " Yes . " " Well , there could be a problem . I just received a customer order to short exactly that amount on almost exactly the same basis  --  all one-month maturities if possible , but three months will be acceptable . " Hofer appeared startled . He asked , " Within what price range ? " " No price limits were given . It 's an absolutely open order . " " Who gave you the order ? " " Direktor Kellermann . " Hofer frowned . Zimmerer continued . " And there 's something else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order for gold bullion . Same customer . " " Who is it ? " " I do n't know , sir . Kellermann just said it 's an important numbered account . " " I 'll check this out with Kellermann . In the meantime , just carry out my instructions , Zimmerer . Thank you . " After Zimmerer had closed the door on the way out , Hofer picked up the phone and dialed four digits . " Kellermann ? " " Jawohl , Herr Doktor . " " Please come up to my office . Now ! " He hung up . The moment he hung up the phone , Hofer regretted his abruptness . Kellermann had a big future with the General Bank of Switzerland . Hofer had personally handpicked him for his current position , the one which Hofer himself had filled for ten years before taking over full command of the bank . He knew that Kellermann did not have it easy . The big private numbered accounts  --  that was the bailiwick of Kellermann , as inherited from Walter Hofer . The system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under a number only . Even where cash withdrawals were concerned , the client  --  in the utter privacy of an upstairs conference room  --  signed for it with his number , written out of course , like " One Hundred and Thirty-five Thousand Six Hundred and Three . " That 's Swiss for John Doe . Only two men in the entire bankingorganization could identify the name of the account owner with the number of his account : the account executive who set up the arrangement and Kellermann who maintained the master file of these privileged clients . The papers which containedthe matching names and numbers were kept in a special safe  --  a huge one  --  solely under Kellermann 's control . It was as burgler- and fireproof as modern technology would allow . But , as still a further safeguard , completely matching documentswere kept in another vault , buried deep in an Alpine cavern in a small town in the Gotthardt Pass . It was literally bombproof . The key importance of the system lay in the fact that no internal spy , who , experience had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organization , could get at this strategic information . For strategic it was . As a group , the people behind these numbers kept assets totalling $20 billion at the General Bank of Switzerland . Brazilians , Frenchmen , Germans , Argentines , British . They were the old hands in the use of this system . But since the 1960s countless newcomers , 136 137from New York , Miami , Las Vegas , Washington , Seoul , Bangkok , Saigon , Taiwan , Hong Kong , had joined the ranks . And then there were the ex-Cubans , the ex-Algerians , ex-kings , exfinanceministers , ex-presidents , ex-gangsters , many of doubtfulnationality not to speak of residency , who regularly enjoyed the traditional hospitality of Switzerland . The motives of all of these people were essentially the same . They sought protection from immoral intrusions into their private affairs . What could be more private than money ? Nothing , said the Swiss , absolutely nothing . And they really meant it , with evangelical fervour . Sure , perhaps some of this money which sought refuge from prying eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Latin America or Asia into Switzerland . Maybe it was stolen . This was not Switzerland 's concern . If nations insisted upon introducing unreasonablyhigh taxes or foreign exchange controls limiting one of man 's God-given freedoms to do what he likes with the money he amasses , that was their fault . Also a crime in Chicago was not necessarily one in Zurich . History had always proved that in money matters the Swiss were right and the rest of the world had been consistently wrong . Little did the world realize the benefits it accrued from this attitude . For it was banks like the General Bank of Switzerland which took what the incurable cynics insisted upon calling " black money , " bleached it , and put it to work productively ; money which otherwise would have remained hidden and idle . Thus Switzerland was able to mobilize capital , lend it to industry , and raise the living standardsof the world . Its banks regularly told their clients to buy World Bank bonds for their numbered accounts , thus truly helping  --  in concrete terms  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who opened the way for prudent men to buy gold , as a warning to those governments who sought to undermine the currencies of the world through reckless spending programs , which only led to inflation and the indirect confiscation of the hard-earned savings of countless numbers of the aged and afflicted . It was banks like the GeneralBank of Switzerland which offered the facilities enabling people from all countries to buy stocks and contribute to the survival of the free world in its fight against communism . The job , though difficult , was truly rewarding . Due to misunderstanding , to envy , one could never be too careful , however . Even vis-a-vis one 's own employees ; pathetic but true in these days of long-haired clerks and gum-chewing secretaries . Even the young officers of the bank could no longer be trusted . They were all too often the products of chaotic universities , of confused professors who did not realize that making money with money represents the very heart of the system which has finally given dignity to a good part of mankind . The numbered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfection , the ultimate response to challenge in the area of finance , was only as good as its guardians . In this regard , Kellermann was perfect . Well , almost perfect . His devotion to the Roman Catholic Church was often disturbing . He did not have to advertise it as he did . After all , the General Bank of Switzerland was a Protestant bank , like almost all of its sister institutions in Switzerland , or for that matter , also in the United States . This was so for good reasons . It was upon the Protestant ethic that all this was built . There were standards to be maintained , confidence to be preserved . To be sure , there was much to be said for ecumenical progress . As long as it did not go too far . Hofer had been one of the first financial leaders of his country to embrace the movement . But he saw himself as a pillar of moderation . More than once he had had to raise his voice in restraint to point out that the moral strength @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teachings were hardly compatible with the machinations of a Leo or a Gregory , not to speak of the hypocrisy of a Pius . To be sure , they were part of the past , but the Jesuits were obviously very much part of the present . The Swiss Constitution still banned them from the country . Correctly so . It may well be that their tactics had changed , but had their basic philosophy ? The confusion of ends and means . This was not the Swiss way of138 139approaching things , and every enlightened Catholic must also realize this . Or be convinced . One stood up for what one knew was right and , if necessary , died on the battlefield like Zwingli for one 's faith and country . The buzzer startled Hofer . He seldom got caught day-dreamingin this manner . Kellerman entered the room and approached Hofer 's desk . " Glad to see you back , Dr. Hofer , " he said . " I hope your trip to Johannesburg was satisfactory . " " It was . Please be seated . I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exchange department . He tells me that you gave him a very large open order to buy gold bullion and sell the dollar short . For a numbered account . What 's the story on that ? " " The client is an American . A certain Mr. Stanley Rosen from New York . We know him well . That is , our branch in Basel knows him . He 's been a major depositor there and has done a lot of securities business with them over the years . In fact , he 's high volume all around . Rosen was one of our first overseas clients to make major Euro-currency placements . Our Basel people tell me that they have had as much as $200 million outstandingfor his accounts at one time  --  all on the usual trust basis . " " It is hardly his money . " " No , sir . Our people in New York have provided us with some background information on the man . It would seem that he has rather irregular types of people for whom he manages money , if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ours . To date he has been absolutely correct in all of his dealingswith us . Very exact , but very correct . Of course he receivesno correspondence from the bank . He comes over and goes through the dossiers on his accounts with Widmer over in Basel about every other month . " " If he has always worked with the Basel branch , why are you all of a sudden handling his business ? " " Yesterday he came up with this very large operation . It 's too big for any of our branches , including Basel . So Widmer sent him directly to me . He , of course , operates exclusively with numbered accounts . His instructions are quite simple . He wants to buy gold bullion at the market for just a shade under $200 million . He put up $100 million in cash . Then he wants to use the gold as collateral for a very substantial short sale of U.S. dollars against the Swiss franc . From our standpoint it makes good sense . We will make at least $1 million in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exposureis nil . Of course , there is risk from his standpoint . " " He realizes this ? " " No doubt . He has one of the fastest minds I 've ever seen among our private clients . Obviously a very professional money manager . I feel that I can completely assure you , Dr. Hofer , that he will not turn into a crybaby and pester us to death if the operation goes wrong . He 's not a troublemaker . So also from that standpoint , our exposure is essentially nil . " " I still do n't like it , " stated Hofer . " At all . Has he come with good funds ? " " Yes , sir . He had the entire $100 million delivered in T-bills a few days ago in New York . The people at our branch there checked out their validity . No problem . They are authentic , not stolen . In fact , they were sold yesterday , and the proceeds have already arrived here . So he 's working from cash . " " No idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sir . They 're bearer instruments , you know . No way of really checking back . But still , there is something . He opened up an entirely new numbered account for these transactions . He maintains about twenty accounts in all with us  --  in Basel , except for this one . There is a co-signature on all the new accountpapers . A certain Ali ben Fezali of Beirut . " " The same one we work with in the currency business ? " " Right . We get shipments of assorted bank notes , and I do mean assorted , about every other week . We buy them from him at rather special rates , and then clear the notes , or most of them , 140 141back to the country of origin . He usually employs the proceeds for the purchase of gold and silver coinage . I would guess that we make large return shipments to him at least once a month . He maintains excellent sight balances with us , and has for many years . All in all , he 's one of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up with Rosen yesterday ? " " No , sir . Apparently Rosen had all the account papers made out and signed a week or so ago . He had a habit of keeping a few sets with him . As I said , he maintains about twenty accountswith us and keeps opening up more all the time . So that 's hardly unusual . Of course we 've got countless specimens of Fezali 's signature , and everything checks out there also . " " Is n't Rosen a Jew ? " asked Hofer . " I assume so , " replied Kellermann . " But I would not attach too much importance to that element . After all , we have seen a lot of stranger combinations around here . " " Has Rosen ever done anything like this before ? " " No . He 's never touched either gold or currency futures . Actually , Widmer over at our Basel branch told me that this operation is completely out of his usual line . Apparently Rosen 's a type who plays things very carefully , never plunges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last drop . A rather ideal type of client . He never blames us for giving him bad advice , like so many of our other American customers . He relies completely upon himself and his own ideas . He 's often not too happy about the delays and errors in our accounting . But that 's not new . All Americans are very fussy in that re-gard . " " The more I hear , the less I like it , " said Hofer . " Look , I do n't want our bank to be dragged into something that could bring us up against the American authorities . You know it 's illegal for an American national to deal in gold bullion . Sure they overlook all the little fishes , but a couple of years ago they tried to get at Bernie Cornfeld and IOS for an alleged gold purchase they made way back in 1968  --  a big one . This could mean big trouble , and that could bring big publicity , especially in those damned American newspapers . One Helga Hughes affair was enough for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeling that there 's something wrong here . Kellermann , you tell our people in New York to get everything available on this man . Right away . And stall Rosen in the meantime . I want a reply on my desk no later than eight tomorrow morning . The fellows in New York have almost all of a working day left to get what we need . " Kellermann frowned . This was not normal , and Kellermann did not like abnormal things . He lived a very orderly life . He prided himself that once his word was given , that was it . And he had given it to Rosen . As far as he was concerned , the bank was committed to carry out Rosen 's instructions , as received . " Dr. Hofer , I 'm afraid that it 's a bit too late to change things very much . I have accepted his order to buy the gold and to start building up his short position in dollars . " " Verbally ? " " Of course . But he will expect to be able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dossier before the week is out . He 's staying in Zurich for that express purpose . As far as I know , Zimmerer 's men must have already arranged to accumulate part of that gold in this afternoon 's fixing session , and no doubt they are also selling dollars as instructed . " Hofer thought this over . " Kellermann , what 's done is done . That 's clear . But now I want you to do something . Immediately . Get hold of Rosen and tell him that we can not proceed further with his orders unlesswe get 50 percent more cash margin . If that does n't stop him , it will at least slow him down quite a bit . Very few people can raise $50 million in cash quickly . " " Yes , sir . " " Now tell me , Kellermann , have any of your other big clients started to move in the same direction ? " " Nothing on the order of Rosen , but things have greatly heated up during the past few hours . Everybody was expecting an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 143Bank for International Settlements . But nothing happened . Apparently they withdrew it at the last moment , without any logical explanation . Reuters had a speculative type of story on the wire just before I came up here . Apparently they got to somebody at the Zurich airport who claimed that the gold was actually shipped in last week but is just sitting there in the bonded warehouse out at Kloten . A thing like that alone could produce a lot more action today , especially in a market which is already on the move . One thing is for sure ; these days the speculators do not lack either money or crazy ideas . " " Kellermann , keep in touch with the gold department and the foreign exchange people . If anything really unusual develops this afternoon , I want you to stay personally on top of it . Something'sgoing on . " Kellermann knew when he was dismissed . Hofer simply no longer recognized his presence . This often proved highly offensive for executives new at the Hofer game . But Kellermann had gotten used to it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's office from any possible audible intrusion from the outside world , and walked down the corridor to the bank of elevators . He was perturbed . He did not like Hofer interfering with his clientele . Especially after he was already committed . More than just Hofer was involved here . It was the integrity of the bank , and of himself . His instructions were clear . If Rosen could produce the additional cash margin , as far as he , Kellermann , was concerned , the deal was on . If not , it was strictly Hofer 's responsibility , and he would have to explain it to Rosen . On that , he would insist . But first he had to give the good news to Rosen . He proceeded to do so , in the briefest of telephone calls. 12 " So we will need an additional $50 million in cash before we can proceed further , Mr. Rosen . " " Fine , Herr Kellermann . I 'll see what I can do . " The telephone went dead for a few seconds . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Completely . I 'll be back to you this afternoon . Let 's say after lunch . You 'll be in ? " " Yes , yes . " " Fine . Good-bye . " Stanley burped , put on a pink shirt , a green tie , a blue suit , brown shoes with black socks . He placed a call to New York and went down to the Grill Room for a steak , well done , and some french fries on the side . He actually enjoyed his lunch , while he mulled over Kellermann , the General Bank of Switzerland , and $50 million . So what else was there to expect ? Everybody has to look after himself . And the aristocrats of the world were the first to learn this . That 's why they became aristocrats . To himself , over lunch , Stanley had no qualms about thinking of his big customers in the States . Sure , they were Mafia . But they were the aristocrats of their chosen line of business . They were the best surviving capitalists in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that made America what it is , as did the Rockefellers , the Harrimans , the Kennedys of past generations . Swiss bankers were cut of exactly  --  but exactly  --  the same cloth . They used the cloak of piety plus the bank secrecy laws in the same way as the Mafia used bribes and the threat of secrecy or death . Both provided services that a greedy and essentially anti-law public wanted . Neither group of twentieth145144century capitalists could survive and prosper to that degree if vast numbers of people , in both low and high places , did not want and need them . The type of power that resulted by merit of their holding the keys to many different kinds of financial kingdoms was as close to invincible as you could get . There was no use fighting it . Bow your head , accept it for what it is , roll with the punches . Cooperate . Since you ca n't join ' em , do n't be stupid enough to try to lick ' em . Just have enough money to keep up with them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Mafiosi and the gnomes of Zurich respect . And money Stanley had . That 's why he enjoyed his lunch . In spite of the fact that his stomach was not exactly in A-1 shape . The tummy trouble had started with that bender the week before . After fooling around in those bars in France and Germany right across the border from Basel until four in the morning , how could it have been avoided ? That guy from Geneva sure had known them all : all the places , all the girls . And could he drink . Brother ! Funny that the stomach business was hanging on so long . But still , it had been worth it . Anythingwould have been worth getting away from that hotel in Basel . Christ , what a stiff dump . And the manager ! Boy , if looks could have killed when we turned up with those gals . Probably a fairy . " Hey . " The head waiter stared at him . " Hey . Gim me the check , will you ? " The head waiter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gim me the check . I 'm expecting a phone call upstairs . " Ten minutes later he got the check , and as he entered his suite , slightly peeved , the phone was ringing . " Your party in New York , " said the operator . " Stanley , is that you ? It 's me , Harry Stahl . " God , thought Rosen , that guy will never learn that you146do n't have to yell to be heard across the Atlantic . Typical New York jerk . " Yes , Harry , it 's me . Now just talk normal , will you . I can hear you fine . How are things going ? " " Fine , fine , " screamed Harry . " How come I have n't heard from you ? I was worried sick that something bad had hap-pened . " " Harry , you worry too much . I 've always told you that . And stop screaming into the phone . " " O.K. Stanley , do n't get worked up . Did you do the deal with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure did . Fantastic thing . I 'm onto something very , very big , Harry . The biggest idea yet . " " Like what ? " " Harry , I do n't want to discuss it on the phone . You understand . Just do one thing for me , right away . Have the First National Bank of Nassau transfer $50 million to the General Bank of Switzerland , head office in Zurich , attention Keller-mann . " " Wait a minute . Attention who ? " " Kellermann . " He spelled it , with one n , and then continued . " Get the guys in Nassau on the phone and stress that it has to be a cable transfer . I want no screwups . The funds have to be good here not later than eight tomorrow morning , Swiss time . That gives you almost all day to arrange it on your side of the ocean . " " Fifty million ? " " Fifty million . " " Out of what accounts ? " " Take five million out of our personal one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of the other really big ones . The guys from St. Louis should be good for five . The Las Vegas group 's account should be good for another five . Just use your judgment . We 've got lots of cash sitting around in the Bahamas . " " You sound awfully sure of yourself this time , Stanley. 147Should n't I , perhaps , come over quick , so we can talk this over ? " " Look , Harry , I 'd like to . But this must move fast . It 's not the sort of thing we can sit around debating about . But do n't worry . I know exactly what I 'm doing . " " That 's going to put every one of our operations pretty short of cash . " " I know . But not for long . This is a quick in and out . And it will involve zero downside risk where our Bahamas money is concerned . I just need that for a very short-term , very highinterestloan , to back up the operation here . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our necks . Rumour has it that some of our clients play pretty rough if something gets screwed up where their money is concerned . " " I know , " was Rosen 's only response , although he did have to admit to himself that Stahl had a point . " Where are you calling from , Stanley ? " " The Baur au Lac in Zurich . But I 'll be checking out of here on Friday . Moving back to Basel for the weekend . Usual place . " " O.K. , Stanley . If anything gets messed up in Nassau , just call me . When do you expect to be back ? " " End of next week . " " O.K. , Stan . Take care , and believe me , I really mean that ! " " Bye , Harry . And thanks , buddy . " He hung up . Great guy , that Harry Stahl . A worrier though . Still , he 's a guy who will stick it out , even if he does n't have a clue as to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . " Fraulein , " he said , " give me the General Bank of Switzerland , head office . I forget the number . I 'll wait . " Why these idiots do n't install direct dial phones in hotels was an eternal mystery . " General Bank of Switzerland . " " I 'd like to speak to Director Kellermann . " " Just one moment , please . " Come on . Come on . " Kellermann , " came the deep voice . " Herr Kellermann , this is Stanley Rosen . You 'll have your $50 million in good funds tomorrow morning . " " Well  --  " Rosen interrupted , " So I expect you to start proceeding on my orders immediately . " " But Mr. Rosen  --  " Again Stanley cut in . " I do n't think there is room for any more buts , ' Herr Kellermann . You agreed to accept my order , and you further agreed to start immediately on the bullion purchases and short dollar sales . Frankly , you broke your commitmentwhen you asked for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'm producing the extra cash . Now I expect you to keep your word . " Rosen , unknowingly , had hit upon Kellermann 's weak spot : he had given his word . " Agreed , Mr. Rosen . I shall proceed . " " Fine . The funds will be coming by cable from the First National in Nassau . If you do n't have them by nine tomorrow morning , call me up . I 'm at the Baur au Lac , Room 718 . In any case I 'll be keeping in touch the next few days . " And that was that . Now Beirut . He placed the call and then undressed and stepped into the shower . The shower dribbled , like most European showers . Probablybecause , when you come right down to it , these birds over here still have an aversion toward water  --  at least too much of it at one time . That 's why the bidets , probably . And the looks of horror when you order some ice water in Paris on a scorching hot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Huge in fact . The phone rang . In the bathroom . Why not ? thought Stanley Rosen and picked up the dainty pink receiver . " Your call to Beirut , sir . You did place one , did n't you ? " " That 's right . I 'll hang on . " A minute went by and Rosen still hung . Onto a pink telephone , in the bathroom of a Swiss hotel , calling an Arab , to148 149talk about buying gold and selling the dollar , by the millions . It had been a long way from New Jersey . But , he thought , it was time to drop New Jersey , and Miami , and Las Vegas , and the rest of it . Very , very slowly and very , very carefully . Because in the investment business there is no such thing as lasting success . There were merely high points  --  and then nothing . That 's the lesson the go-go boys in the fund business , the hot-shots in the brokerage game , the hot-wind artists in the savings and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maybe five years , they ended up on the same pavement they started from . There is a very definite cycle to success in any business . Rosen was convinced of this . It was obvious to any fool industry . From the transistor to the colour TV to fast-back car to miniskirts . They started as an innovation , soared to unbelievable heights within a short time , and ended up overproduced , market-saturated , and ordinary . As time progressed , the life cycles were becoming shorter and shorter and shorter , from sensational birth to ignominious commonplaceness . The same was true with ideas in the financial business . Growth , hot new issues , performance  --  the gospel of a bright new generation , the obvious solution , the modern way of life  --  if one expected to live for three years . Capital preservation , yield , interest  --  the new philosophy of a new permanent approach to investments . Life expectancy : two years . **28;249;TOOLONG , natural resources , ecology  --  the magic formula for the next well-spring to eternal financial success . Interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stanley so well knew , you had to sell the clients on something . And no sooner were they sold , the something was passe . But if you did not sell them , somebody else right in the middle of the current product cycle would , and no more clients . A rat race . Stanley had , with the rest of them , tried them all on . Now he was down to gold , devaluations , tax havens . Arabs . Perhaps the shortest life cycle of all . And for what ? And then there was the even bigger problem . Jersey , Miami , Vegas , and all that. 150Maybe the answer was so simple it might work . Just cut out . Move to Switzerland , Bermuda , even London . With maybe $30 or $35 million there could be no doubt that he would be accepted , maybe not by the people right at the top of the heap , but still accepted by most people for what he represented : money and brains . Then he would manage just a very few clients @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No more monkey business . Stanley Rosen had reached that ominous stage of almost forty-five years of age ; the point of no return . What he wanted to find above all other things was something that had totally passed him by thus far : a period of real happiness and simple contentment . He had first really sensed that such an unbelievablegoal might still be achievable not so very long ago . In August he 'd spent three weeks doing absolutely nothing on the island of Sardinia , with a young girl of twenty-four from Norway . They had met at the Copenhagen airport and had taken the same taxi into town . They had dinner outside in the Tivoli . Corny , but fun . Then five days later , off into the blue together . Totally unplanned . To Sardinia . The Calle di Volpe . A hotel built for no more than sixty guests ; Frenchmen , Belgians , Swiss , British , Italians , Germans . All well to do . Some even titled . Clubby . But they had accepted Stanley . They had asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a supper . And nobody had asked him for a loan . He had even accepted the invitation of a pair from Brussels to drop in on them at home afterwards . It turned out he was in the Cabinet . Yet Stanley Rosen was accepted as an old friend , a guest of honour . Sure . Rosen knew that they knew . That he had a great deal of money . But somehow , almost like sleight of hand , it was never mentioned . He knew that they knew he was an American " primitive . " But they seemed to regard this as merely curious ; his Jersey accent as rather cute ; his mannerisms as " natural . " Rosen was no fool . But he knew that here was a world that he must eventually pay for on the open market . He knew that the question of price would inevitably come up . But it would be151worth it . Then the crude pigs from Chicago , the show girls from Las Vegas , their drunken brawls in Nassau , the nit-picking little Jews @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , just as his parents had buried their memories of their ghetto in Poland . Through the simple process of emigration across the Atlantic . Thank God he had his divorce well behind him . For with her , her ghastly makeup , her shrill voice , her girlfriends , her canasta parties , the whole idea would have been absurd . But with somebody like that girl from Bergen , with a clientele in the Near East , with the credentials of a stunning success during the Great Dollar devaluation , it was possible . The pink telephone finally came alive again . " Hallo , hallo , qui est la ? " came the voice . " This is Stanley Rosen calling from Switzerland , I would like to " Hallo , hallo . Je ne parle pas Anglais , Monsieur . " " Oh my God , " came Stanley Rosen 's reply . He clicked the receiver rather frantically , hoping to hell that the connection would not be broken . " Operator , operator " he yelled . Nothing . And then more than nothing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Son of a bitch , " cursed Stanley Rosen . Well , nothing to be done . It would take at least two or threehours to get through again . Forget about it until later . The phone rang again . " This is the operator , Mr. Rosen . Was your call to Beirut satisfactory ? It was rather short . " " Yes , operator . Perfectly satisfactory . Thank you . " No sense in making an absolute ass of himself . This was certainlyone thing he had to correct and quickly . A quick course in French and perhaps one in German . Mr. Stanley Rosen would soon be as European as Grace Kelly . Shower completed , Stanley decided to take a nap . He was satisfied , satisfied with the future now that the biggest action of his lifetime was underway. 13Historians who later reconstructed these happenings during this first week of November determined that the real action started around two-fifteen on that Wednesday afternoon . The dollar was hit by the biggest wave of selling thus far experienced in the twentieth century . It dropped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against every major currency in Western Europe , led by the Swiss franc . Around three o'clock it looked as if a recovery might occur , but then came the news of the afternoon gold fixing . The price jumped $4.10 in one session . It meant that the gold pools in both Zurich and London were unable to cope with the sudden burst of demand for the metal . After that , the situation of the dollar worsened by the minute . Secretary-General Bollinger of the Bank for International Settlements was sitting alone in his office , poring over the Telex reports that had been flooding in since lunchtime . He looked slightly sick . He had instructed his secretary to put through no further calls , with two exceptions : the American secretary of the treasury and a certain Dr. Bernoulli . " What now ? " he asked . The almost man-sized carving from New Guinea staring at him from across the room could hardly answer . Just two more days to go , and all hell was breaking loose . And of all bloody people , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story they would crucify him  --  at best . Ausgerechnet die Russen ! This morning when the president of the German Bundesbank had called him , he had thought , had hoped , that it was just a coincidence . The Russians could have had a million reasons for shifting over to dollars on the pipe-152 153line purchase . Nor had the Germans been overly perturbed . They had just thought that the BIS should know . It would mean that the future demand for dollars in the Euromarket would now be higher than had generally been anticipated . That 's all . It might push the long-term rates up . Maybe by .25 percent . But the people in Frankfurt did not know what he knew . And now everything was starting to tie together . First Melekov , then the delegation from Moscow pulling out , then the pipeline switch , and now the foreign exchange and gold markets going all to hell . Before it was over it could cost the United States billions  --  three , five , who knows  --  and the whole financial world would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thrown right out the window . Knowing the Americans , he knew that they would defend the dollar right up to the last second , rather than lose face to the Russians . His secretary opened the door , but she just stuck her head in . She knew when the storm warnings were flying . " Herr Doktor Bernoulli just called from the lobby downstairs and asked if he could come right up . " " Tell him to come ahead . " Bollinger was close to panic . For he was a man of total integrity , completed devoted to the immense responsibility which had been entrusted to him . He was one of those few internationalcivil servants with enough courage and foresight to go out on a limb and do what he felt was right , regardless of the possible political consequences . He had seen no better path of action than that which he had undertaken in this terrible situation , better for all the governments concerned , including the United States . Bollinger was anything but devious . His approachwas analytical ; his actions were based upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now defiedanalysis . Events had gone underground , into a world which Bollinger had never experienced , and before which he found himself helpless . . . and increasingly bitter . Bernoulli entered his office . " Please excuse me for visiting you so unexpectedly , HerrBollinger , but I 'm afraid that events are moving very swiftly . I must try to keep up with them . " " No problem . Please be seated . " " I think we have made excellent progress . We know now exactly the chain of action which led up to the theft . We know the two men responsible for the organization and implementation . But we still do not have the answer to the key question : Who was the final recipient of the red dossier ? And what does he intend to do with it  --  if anything ? " " I see . " " Now I do n't want to frighten you , but we 've heard about the visit of that Russian delegation . The stay in Basel of your guests from Moscow coincides exactly with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stayed at exactly that hotel in which the two men responsible for the physical action were seen together , more than once . The coincidence is almost overpowering , if you know what I mean . This is not the only coincidence , however . I 'll come to others later . But first , let 's deal with the Russians . " " I frankly think you are running so far behind the events , Herr Bernoulli , that before I let you continue , I should bring you up to date on a few things . It will save you from wasting any more time on this matter . " Bernoulli did n't like this . His eyes drew closely together . His hands clenched . And his healthy brown was suddenly tinged with more than a trace of red . " What 's that supposed to mean ? " Bernoulli finally asked , after a long stare across Bollinger 's desk . His voice was tight . Being upstaged by an amateur at this point was not to his liking . " I like the word coincidence . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I believe that you will get my point . " " Go ahead . That 's why I came to see you , you know . " " First , the Russian delegation . They came here to finalize arrangements for the sale of a major shipment of gold . This is by no means unusual . We have been handling the marketing of154 155the Russians ' gold for many years now . The reason is quite simple . We ourselves are a very large owner of gold . In fact , we are the only financial institution in the world which has its total capital and reserves in the form of gold . Thus we have the capacity to immediately absorb , if necessary , complete major shipments , which otherwise would overwhelm the free market and cause dangerous price fluctuations . The Soviet Union can get a firm price from us  --  for every last ounce . They like that . We also like that , since it gives us another means for interveningin  --  tampering with , if you like  --  the free market for that metal . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to currency speculation . We try our best to avoid the latter at almost any cost . " " Thanks for the explanation , Herr Bollinger . But I 'm afraid it does not bring us very much further . " Bernoulli was already on his second cigarette . " Now easy does it . Back to coincidences . The Russians came here especially to finalize the arrangements for the sale of 20 million ounces . They negotiated at the usual Eastern Europeanpace with the head of our gold department . Everything was finally agreed upon . The days after the disappearance of the dossier from my safe , the negotiations halted just this side of being signed . Nobody spoke of any cancellation of the sale . They just said that they had to get the final authorization from Moscow and would come back to us within a very short time . They left town that same day . We have not heard from them since . " " Where 's the gold ? " " In the Zurich airport . " " Why did n't you tell me this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it has happened before . It was by no means out of character . I believe that it would only have been grossly misleading if I had attached undue significance to such an event  --  and led you down the garden path . " " Then why do you attach such significance to it now ? " " Because of coincidence number two . For almost a year theRussians have been negotiating with the Germans for an immensepurchase of line pipe . Also here the negotiations reached the signature stage . At the very last moment , contrary to all prior indications , the Russians insisted that they would pay only in U.S. dollars . " Bernoulli got the point . " But now comes the clincher . Since late yesterday afternoon , Eastern Europe has been selling dollars  --  both spot and forward . Today it has become serious . The spot rate in Zurich has been pushed down to 3.33 from 3.40 within two hours . In the foreign exchange field this is an unprecedented change . Like the Dow Jones falling 100 points in one trading session . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bollinger , what do you intend to do ? " " I 'm waiting to see what happens in New York . The markets are now closed in Europe . The next moves will take place across the Atlantic . If the selling continues , we must start to act . The president of the Swiss National Bank and the finance minister will be consulted . I brought you fellows into this , much to my great regret . I must try to be fair with you right to the end . " " And what about the Americans ? " " I 'll have to deal with them in my own way . " " This could get pretty bad before the weekend , I imagine . " " Yes . So if you 'll please excuse me , Herr Bernoulli , I really must get back on the job . " " Just one more question . Do you really think the Russians would pull such a brazen , naked attempt to disgrace the United States ? " " A few years ago I would have said no . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Soviet Union . They 're anything but Stalinists . But they are also not of the Khrushchev school . They calculate . They recognize that the best weapon at the disposal of the Soviet Union is not the Red Army of Stalin , or their rockets , but the immense economic potential of their country . And contrary to Western countries , they have156 157absolute central control of their economy . They can direct its energy like a general his army . But the weak point has always been the ruble . Or to put it another way , the dominating role of the dollar . Downgrade the latter , and you automatically upgrade the former in many areas of the world . Destruction of faith in the dollar system can not help but be a major policy objective of anyone at odds with the United States . De Gaulle recognized all this years ago and took the initiative . He did not succeed . The Russians are in a quite different class , of course . " But the risk . " " What risk ? The United States has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it also has very few allies . On gold , none . The power of the dollar is a greater source of resentment throughout the Western world than any other element of American foreign policy , even right here in Switzer-land . " Bernoulli rose and shook hands with Bollinger . But as he was leaving , he got in one parting shot . " To mysimple mind , this all seems just a little too pat . In any case , if anything new develops , we 'll probably see each other again . " As Bernoulli left , Bollinger picked up his phone and called the foreign exchange desk of the bank . " What 's happening in New York ? " " It 's continuing , sir . The bid price on spot francs has nowdropped to just a shade under 3.31 cents . As you know , under the term of the 1973 monetary agreement , the Swiss National Bank must intervene at this level . They will have to start buyingdollars . What do you want us to do ? " " Nothing at the moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We might have to stay on right through Tokyotonight . " He hung up and redialed . " Joan , get me the President ofthe National Bank in Zurich , please . Right away . " The call was through in less then thirty seconds . " " This isBollinger . How do things look to you ? " 158 " We do n't like it a bit . Where 's all this selling coming from ? " Bollinger thought carefully before he replied . " Seems tohave started in Eastern Europe . Then Zurich , Frankfurt , Paris , it would seem . " " What are you fellows going to do ? " " I 'm not sure . Maybe it will start to correct itself in New York . " The National Bank president did not seem to buy that one . " I 'm not so sure . Funny damned thing . It came out of absolutelynowhere . We 've more or less got used to these currency speculators crawling out of the woodwork every fall , but normallyyou can see them coming . This thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 've heard about New York , I suppose . The dollar has dropped below the 3.31 level . Will you start to intervene ? " " We 're having a meeting in about fifteen minutes on that subject . My guess is that we 'll try to hold it here for the rest of the day . A slight turnaround in Europe tomorrow could produce a surge of covering of short positions . Then we would be out of the woods . That 's my thinking at the moment . " " Thanks . That 's very important for us . We will probably alsobe in the market in New York within a short time , trying to stop this thing . I 'll keep in touch . " " What are the people in Washington saying ? " " I do n't know . I expect to hear from them any moment now , " replied Bollinger . " Right . Thanks for the call . " Although already five o'clock in Switzerland , it was only eleven in the morning in Washington . The secretary of the treasury was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As he stepped out of the car another government vehicle rolled up right behind him . It was the secretary of state . Both cleared the security people together , and were immediately metby one of the president 's assistants who took them directly to the Cabinet room.
