While President Carter sets the broad goals and makes the decisions by which he seeks to fulfill them , his National Security Adviser , Zbigniew Brzezinski , provides much of the long-range thinking and the intellectual framework on which foreign policy rests . TIME White House Correspondent Stanley Cloud explored Brzezinski 's ideas in two long interviews . His report : <P> <P> More than a year ago , Professor Zbigniew Brzezinski of Columbia University wrote an article for Foreign Policy magazine titled " America in a Hostile World . " He called for a " new international economic order " and for new American leadership to help create it-a leadership that would set " politically and morally compelling directions to which the public might then positively respond . " Now the Polish emigre academic , a man of angular features whose crew cut seems a carryover from the ' 50s , is comfortably entrenched in the West Wing of Jimmy Carter 's White House , in the same large , gold-hued corner office once occupied by another foreign-born but very different ex-professor , Henry Kissinger . Brzezinski @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ambitious , is thus in a unique position to translate many of his long-held theories into policy . <P> Some of the professor 's critics find his ideas , as one puts it , " impossibly abstract , which is not to be confused with being cerebral . " Yet Carter has no such complaint and appreciates Brzezinski 's ability to articulate ideas . <P> The man who saw the " hostile world " professes little alarm at what many view as a world grown even more hostile since Carter took office . He reckons that sharp shifts in U.S. policy must inevitably shake things up for a time . The changes are necessary , he argues , because " an old-world order is coming to an end and the shape of a new world community is yet to be defined . " The old order , based largely on military power and nationalism , is giving way to " a technetronic age " in which there will be increasing emphasis on economic development and social justice . The old East-West ideological struggle will wane in importance ; the North-South @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ importance . In this emerging world , according to Brzezinski , " military power by itself will no longer dictate the ability of a nation to influence political , social and cultural developments . " <P> Brzezinski sees the need for the U.S. to pay more attention to nations beyond its traditional allies in Europe and Japan and its traditional adversary , the Soviet Union . If this alarms the Kremlin , he remains unruffled . He predicts that elements of U.S.-Soviet " cooperation and competition will be mixed for a long time to come , " and he argues that Soviet-American relations must be " assimilated into a new approach toward the world as a whole . " Brzezinski sees the Kremlin leaders as aging in both years and ideas , and feels that the U.S. is much more in step with the currents of global change . But if he really feels that the Russians have already lost the ideological struggle , that is a view that one senior foreign policy expert on Capitol Hill considers " as fundamental a misconception as I can think of .
