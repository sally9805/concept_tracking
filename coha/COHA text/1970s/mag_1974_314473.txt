BAD HABITS byTERRENCE McNALLY <P> Terrence McNally is a sprint man , not a miler . When he attempts a full-length play ( Things That Go Bump in the Night ; Where Has Tommy Flowers Gone ? ) , his gifts tend to make an embarrassing exeunt . But in the circumscribed province of the one-acter he is rapidly becoming a master . <P> Bad Habits , his latest miniatures , provide two glimpses of limbo , caparisoned as a sanitarium . In Ravenswood , Dr. Pepper ( Paul Benedict ) , clearly a descendant of the March Hare on both sides of his family , presides over braces of sickies . Among them : a pair of bickering queen homosexuals ; an actor and actress , both deeply in love with the full-length mirror ; and two middle-aged parvenus who have risen without a trace . Dr. Pepper 's loony prescriptions come to have a sense all their own : increased cigarette smoking , high cholesterol diets , tap-dance therapy , internecine squabbles - all are manifestly designed to hasten the end of a few more nuisances . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ types ; this funny farm is liberally mined with terror as well as gags . <P> Young Transvestite . In Dunelawn , the caricatures grow even broader . Here the healer , Dr. Toynbee , is indeed the March Hare . His patients -a Japanese sadist , a young transvestite and an old lush - are incessantly drugged and straitjacketed ; with rabbity gestures , the good doctor counsels them in purest gibberish . To hinder matters , his nurses are starched psychotics , and his grounds keeper is King Kong in a man suit . These are difficult characters to bring off on the page ; they are next to impossible on the stage . Fortunately , Director Robert Drivas ( a first-rate actor in his spare time ) is well aware of Emerson 's dictum : " In skating over thin ice , our strength is our speed . " His varie gated cast moves with a velocity only slightly tardier than light . The ice may crack , but it never breaks ; the wit and venom are rarely interrupted by anything but laughter . In the process , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the season . At one point , a nurse ( Cynthia Harris ) angrily challenges the transvestite ( F. Murray Abraham ) : " Do you know what they call peo ple like you ? " " Fashionable . " His answer is Off-Broadway immediate : would benefit enormously if that label were to adhere to the good evening of Bad Habits .
