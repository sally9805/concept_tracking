Despite its reputation as a stable for opera 's cavalry , the Metropolitan Opera does , of course , produce works that are new or outside the standard repertory . The results are uneven . This season has already seen an unfortunate production of Benjamin Britten 's Death in Venice , an attenuated musical rumination exquisitely ill-suited to a house of the Met 's proportions . Last week the company used its resources to far better effect . It revived Czech Composer Leos Jancek 's Jenufa , last heard at the Met 50 years ago in a production starring Maria Jeritza . Still looking glamorous at 87 , Jeritza watched opening night from the front left box . She was applauded warmly at the first intermission . <P> Jenufa ' s slow recognition in the U.S. bears coincidental resemblance to its composer 's career . If ever there was a late bloomer , it was Jancek . A Moravian , he was professor of composition but wrote little of consequence himself before he was 40 . He completed Jenufa in 1903 when he was 49 . It received @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He wrote several other operas , including From the House of the Dead , which is almost a speculation on Dostoyevsky 's novel , and The Makropoulos Affair , a fantastic showpiece for orchestra . <P> Rimmed World . Though it can be placed well enough among turn-of-the-century verismo works , Jenufa is an elusive opera in some ways . The setting is a Moravian village , and the composer knew its inhabitants with detachment and compassion . He creates no heroes , but a world of people working , flirting , taking naps , worrying about saving face or avoiding the draft . The plot , however , concerns deadly primal emotions : love , jealousy and ambition . Jenufa is pregnant by steva , a wastrel who chases every girl in town . Jenufa still hopes to catch him , but her world is invisibly rimmed by two figures far more powerful than she and her faithless swain . One is a poor man named Laca , who loves her with a ferocity that drives him to ruin her beauty-all that steva ever noticed about her-by slashing her cheek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foster mother Kostelnica , the church sextoness and a respected authority in the village . When Kostelnica realizes that steva will not settle down and that Laca could not live with the child , she drowns Jenufa 's baby . Though Jenufa and Laca decide to marry in the end , there is an almost untouchable sadness about the opera . Jancek in middle age seemed able to summon back the passions of youth and apply the judgment of experience to their consequences . <P> That his peasant drama succeeds so well lies in the music . Just as there are no heroes , there are no big arias or set-piece scenes . Not that the opera is merely a modified tone poem ; it is compellingly dramatic . In style , there may be a bit of Mascagni pageantry here , an arioso there that could have flown right out of Butterfly . But the sound is distinct and modern , punctuated by post-romantic dissonances . Then there are charming interludes peculiar to Jancek . He loved duplicating spoken inflections and rhythms in sung speech . He doted on mini @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Greek church modes into his music .
