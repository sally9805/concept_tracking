The name of the game is Guts Frisbee , and to a growing number of serious competitors it is the greatest sport around . Two five-member teams stand on boundaries set 15 yards apart and take turns hurling a Pro Model Frisbee so hard , or on so tricky a trajectory , that no opponent can make a clean one-handed grab . It sounds easy , but catching the acrobatic platter can be as difficult as catching Vida Blue fastballs without a glove . Points are awarded to the throwing team if the receivers muff a catch , and to the receiving team if a throw goes too wide or too high . The first team to score 21 points wins . Desperate lunges , volleyball-style tips to keep the darting disk in play , skinned knees , mashed fingers and bloody noses are all part of the game . <P> There is even an International Frisbee Tournament held annually in the isolated Michigan Upper Peninsula community of Copper Harbor ( pop . 50 ) . Two weeks ago , several thousand spectators came to watch 36 teams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Five and the Humbly Magnificent Champions of the Universe compete for the world 's Guts Frisbee championship . Some of the players came from as far away as Canada , Germany and Australia . And though the tournament 's atmosphere of low camp was clearly a spoof on all organized sports , the matches were fought in dead earnest . <P> " We play this game seriously and I think scientifically , " said Roger Barrett , a member of the high-ranked Fuchsia team from Berkeley , Calif . He and his cohorts had practiced such exotic deliveries as sidearms , thumbers , under-hands and upside-down wrist flips no less than three hours a day for months - but to no avail . They lost in the finals to the defending champion Highland Avenue Aces of Wilmette , 111. , who had coolly scouted out the weak spots in the Californians ' game . During the match , the winners destroyed Fuchsia 's confidence with a steady stream of verbal taunts . The Aces ' reward : the Julius T. Nachazel Memorial Trophy , made from a couple of tin cans and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ professor whose name had appealed to the tournament 's director , Jumbo Jim Davis . <P> Wham-O . Even if Frisbee eventually becomes a professional sport , as some observers fear , there is still likely to be more money in selling the disks than in flipping them . Twenty-four years ago , a Los Angeles building inspector named Fred Morrison invented the Frisbee after studying the airworthy pie pans used by the now defunct Frisbie bakery company of Bridgeport , Conn . In 1956 he sold the patent on an improved design to the Wham-O Co. ( those wonderful people who brought you the Hula-Hoop ) , and since then the royalties have been sailing in : about $800,000 to date . <P> Dr. Stancil Johnson , a long-haired Santa Monica psychiatrist who serves as Frisbee 's official historian , has an apparently sober explanation for the disks ' popularity . They are , he says , " the perfect marriage between man 's greatest tool-his hand-and his greatest dream - to fly . " But even Johnson is hard-pressed to account for the latest development on the Frisbee front . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " froupies , " short for Frisbee groupies . They too seemed to want to have a fling .
