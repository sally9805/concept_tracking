Pan Am picks a U.S. model , while Eastern goes European <P> Time has not been kind to U.S. airlines . Poor financial health has robbed some of the biggest carriers of vitality in recent years , limiting their ability to replace aging , noisy , fuel-inefficient aircraft , some of them two decades old . But now passenger traffic is up , some lines are reporting profits or lower losses , and not much time is left to start replacing obsolescent airplanes-so the big carriers have begun moving on aircraft purchases that could total $80 billion by the end of the 1980s . Last week two lines signed deals for $1.3 billion , the first sizable jet buys since the airlines ' fat years of the 1960s . Pan American World Airways ordered $500 million worth of wide-bodied L-1011-500 TriStars from California 's Lockheed Corp . Eastern Airlines handed the Europeans an important victory over U.S. planemakers by closing a $778 million package deal to buy 19 A300-B4 minijumbos from Airbus Industrie , a French-German-Spanish consortium . That will be the biggest U.S. purchase of European aircraft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Burbank , Lockheed 's headquarters , and to Airbus Industrie 's offices in cities across Europe . At Lockheed , which almost went bankrupt a few years ago , partly because of long production delays and lagging sales of the TriStar , happy executives called the Pan Am order for a dozen planes , plus an option for 14 more in the mid-1980s , the " order of the century . " Johnson 's Bakery , near Lockheed 's offices , whipped up a cake with an icing decoration of a high-flying TriStar . Nora Winant , secretary to Richard Taylor , Lockheed 's chief negotiator in the sale , hung Pan Am travel posters and blue-and-white streamers in a paneled executive conference room , which became the site for a party . <P> In Europe , the response was more restrained , even though Airbus Industrie had pushed so hard for the sale to Eastern that it lent the airline four A300s to test on some of its U.S. runs . Sniffed Jochen Eichen of Deutsche Airbus G.M.B.H. , the German wedge of the Airbus Industrie polyglot : " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Airbus . All it means is that the operation may become profitable more quickly . " <P> In Great Britain , though , there was shop-floor cheering at the factories of Rolls-Royce , whose advanced RB.211 engines will power Pan Am 's TriStars . To Rolls , Pan Am 's initial order means $218.5 million in sales and an even richer psychological reward . Start-up costs for the RB.211 pushed the famous automaker into bankruptcy and its jet-engine operation into nationalization in 1971 . Sir Kenneth Keith , 61 , chairman of Rolls-Royce Ltd. , believes that the future of the RB.211 program has been enhanced by the Pan Am deal . Said he : " It has been a cliffhanger . Six months ago , I would not have given even money on it . But now it 's in the bag-absolutely. "
