Boston 's Northeastern University has 38,000 full-and part-time students , which makes it just about the largest private university in the U.S. , but it has long been overshadowed by the fame of such neighbors as Harvard and M.I.T. Lately , however , many educators have come to look on Northeastern 's work-study program as an answer to their own institutions ' financial troubles . The reason : by adopting the Northeastern system , a college can increase its enrollment by 40% without having to hire new faculty or constructing new buildings . <P> The system works this way : after a conventional freshman year , a student alternates a semester of classroom learning with a semester of work related to his studies . A chemistry major may work as a laboratory technician , for example , a business major as a salesman , or a mathematics major as a computer programmer . Called " cooperative education " ( or " co-op " ) because it enlists the participation of 1,600 Boston-area employers , the Northeastern system requires five years for a degree . But enthusiasts say that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a practical goal for their studies , gives them a head start on their careers and enables youngsters from poor families to earn a college education . Northeastern estimates that about two-thirds of its 9,283 undergraduate co-op students work their way through college ( tuition : $775 per quarter ) thanks to co-op jobs paying from $70 to $150 a week . <P> Soil on Hands . Northeastern was among the pioneers of the co-op plan back in 1909 , but in the next three decades only 25 other schools followed its lead . Since 1962 , however , colleges like Wilberforce University in Ohio , Beloit College in Wisconsin and Pasadena City College in California have flocked to the plan , both for its inherent educational advantages and for its solutions to problems of space and cost . Today , more than 300 institutions have begun cooperative education . An estimated 300 more are considering the step-spurred on by a White House recommendation that $10.8 million in startup grants be voted by Congress . Last month some 250 businessmen and educators met near Boston for a crash course on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Secretary of Labor and now president of the Manpower Institute , summed up the theory this way : " The learning and work functions-with love-seem to me to involve life 's identifiable values . None is meaningful without the others . " Says Northeastern 's Dean of Co-op Education Roy L. Wooldridge : " For years Northeastern labored in the vineyard , looked down on by other schools because we got soil on our hands . Suddenly , a lot of people want some soil in their ivory towers . " <P> Co-op education is not equally suited to everyone . Some of Northeastern 's 2,240 liberal arts students have a hard time finding jobs that relate directly to studies in philosophy or literature . Gary Esposito , a political science major , spent his most recent co-op term as a bank clerk ( " It was that or nothing , " he says ) . Some professors complain that their students place too much emphasis on vocational training . As one critic put it , " the sociology majors all want to become social workers .
