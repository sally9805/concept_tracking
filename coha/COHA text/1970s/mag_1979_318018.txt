Though the 1980 election is still eleven months away , Republican Candidate Ronald Reagan says he is already spending so much time traveling that he no longer feels that he just gets on airplanes : " I wear them . " That view is shared by TIME 's National Political Correspondent , John Stacks , who has a mandate to range far and frequently to meet candidates and test political moods . In the past two months , Stacks has done extensive firsthand reporting on Massachusetts Senator Edward Kennedy , California Governor Jerry Brown , Texas Republican George Bush and Reagan . He and Los Angeles Correspondent Joseph Kane collaborated on the profile and interview of the former actor and Governor that appear in the Nation section this week , on the occasion of Reagan 's formal announcement of his candidacy for the White House . Says Stacks : " What I expect to be doing in the coming months is a great deal of flying-on big planes , medium-sized ones , little ones . Constant motion is the first rule of political coverage . The variety of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protection against misunderstanding the politics of any campaign year . " <P> Pennsylvania-born Stacks , who lives in the Washington suburb of Chevy Chase , Md. , majored in political science at Yale ( ' 64 ) and got his first journalistic exposure to national politics as a general assignment reporter for the Washington Star . By the 1968 campaign he had joined TIME , for which he covered the Democratic candidates through the election . In 1972 , as Boston bureau chief , he followed the New England primaries , and in 1976 he was part of the Washington bureau team that trailed the Carter-Mondale campaign . After taking a leave from his correspondent 's duties-first to help Watergate Judge John Sirica compose his memoirs , later to write as a member of TIME 's New York staff-Stacks returned to the pursuit of politicians . <P> This will keep Stacks airborne . Last week , when Reagan went to New York City to launch his presidential drive at a dinner in Manhattan , Stacks was unable to attend because of a previous engagement : he had flown to Des Moines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Iowa . Despite all the arduous travel involved , Stacks takes special pleasure in campaign reporting . " Politicians are sometimes silly , sometimes banal , frequently self-serving and occasionally absolutely unbearable , " he says . " But they are just as often earnest , serious and creative in proposing solutions to the problems the nation faces . In an election year , there is no better assignment in journalism .
