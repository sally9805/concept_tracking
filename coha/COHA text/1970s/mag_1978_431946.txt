 | The Criminal Mind : A Startling New Lok @# WHAT DO WE DO with a confirmed hard-core criminal like Charlie ? * His career fits none of the widely accepted social and psychological theories about the causes and cures of crime . He comes from a solid middle-class family . His parents are devoted to each other and their three sons . Indeed , Charlie 's two younger brothers are college graduates , good citizens and jobholders . Not Charlie . He became a professional criminal . As a child , he was a liar , thief and brawler who brandished knives and threatened his playmates , shoplifted , and committed burglaries , armed robberies , assaults and dozens of rapes before he was 15 years old . He spent nine months in a juvenile-detention home , but it did no good . By age 18 , he had been responsible for thousands of felonies. @# Arrested for housebreaking , assault and rape at age 19 , Charlie feigned insanity and was committed to a mental hospital . He spent ten years there , won release and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But secretly he went right back to his , * old predatory ways : robbery , bur ' - glary , assaults . Caught after three years for an assault-rape attempt , Charlie got off with ten years ' probation . Today , at 37 , he roams loose , , committing dozens of crimes every year , a ticking bomb who may well kill someone before he is put away for life or is himself killed . Clearly , Charlie and his kind pose a stupendous problem for society . The evidence is mounting that a hugely disproportionate share of our crime is committed by a small number of hard-core criminals like Charlie ; that our criminal-justice system is dismally failing to identify and isolate the Charlies ; and that our correctional institutions fail either to  | rehabilitate them or to identify and incarcerate them so law-abiding citizens are safe from their depredations . Now , a 17-year , federally financed , three-volume study , The Criminal Personality , provides the most probing profile ever produced of career criminals like Charlie . The startling findings seem to point to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rehabilitating most of these hard-core Charlies ; for the immediate future we must be prepared to imprison them permanently . But a more hopeful , exciting conclusion also emerges : we can make a huge reduction in crime by early identification and incarceration of a relatively small proportion of offenders , and a significant minority of even these seemingly " hopeless " cases can be rehabilitated . The Predatory Mind . In 196o , Dr. Samuel Yochelson had an established psychiatric practice in Buffalo , N.Y. , and a glittering reputation . Dr. Winfred Overholser , superintendent of St. Elizabeths Hospital , the federal mental hospital in Washington , D.C. , asked Yochelson to direct a wideranging investigation of criminal behavior . Yochelson agreed , with one proviso : the criminals he interviewed should know that nothing they revealed could influence their treatment , prosecution or release ; thus they would have small incentive to feign illness or improvement , or to conceal the truth . During the next 15 years , Yochelson and his colleagues studied 252 male hard-core criminals , among them 162 adults and 59 juveniles ages 13 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came exclusively from St. Elizabeths ? inmates found not guilty on insanity pleas . Later , they interviewed other criminals from prisons , on probation and parole , and off the streets . They also interviewed families , girlfriends , employers and associates . Yochelson initially went along with all of the accepted theories on the social and psychological causes of crime . He tried the conventional psychoanalytic and psychiatric techniques and ran batteries of blood , hormone and chromosome tests seeking physiological bases for abnormal behavior . But by 1965 , he realized he was getting nowhere and reached this judgment : " Psychiatric concepts and techniques do n't work with criminals , because most diagnoses of mental illness result from the criminals ' fabrications . " Yochelson continued his probing , however , and in 1966 decided to try a major new technique : the " stream of thinking " or " phenomenologic " report . " Forget the past , concentrate on the here and now and report on your thoughts , every day , " Yochelson told his subjects . " Imagine you have a **25;97;TOOLONG camera @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Take notes in detail . And play back the tape ' for me tomorrow . " This simple " TV camera " device proved a magic key that unlocked the closed chambers in the criminals ' minds . For years they had been  | " gaming " with Yochelson , talking circles and trying a myriad of manipulative tricks . But , with its shift from the distant past to the present , this new type of reporting was hard to fake . Portrait of Evil . As Yochelson listened to the criminals ' " tapes , " one of his most shocking discoveries was the sheer frequency and range of each criminal 's depredations . By the time he was first arrested , he had committed hundreds or even thousands of offenses . Each of the 252 criminals admitted committing enough crimes to spend more than 1500 years in jail . Moreover , most had committed violations in all three categories of crime ? property , sex , assault . In 1970 , Yochelson asked clinical psychologist Stanton Samenow to join his study , and together they discovered that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hard-core criminal 's personality development was the same . From an early age the youngster was seen by his parents as " different . " Hyperactive physically and mentally , usually with average or above-average intelligence , he was addicted to " excitement , " which meant doing the forbidden . He was chronically restless , irritable , dissatisfied ? traits that were to remain with him . As a pre-schooler , he was stealing from his mother 's purse , lying , cheating , fighting . Yet more than half these hard-core criminals came from stable families , and every home had some stabilizing , caring influence . They came from families rich and poor , from urban ghettos and affluent suburbia . Early they learned to rationalize , to blame their parents , to see themselves as " victims of their environment , " not mentioning the brothers and sisters who surmounted the same background to lead moral lives . Always , the career criminal is shown to have shied from affection , neither giving nor receiving . Crime did not come to him ; he deliberately went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find " action " and other delinquent youngsters to emulate and impress . He craved to be No. 1 . When caught , the criminal youngster enjoyed the excitement and challenge of escaping or mitigating punishment . As he encountered the criminal-justice system , he read law books , learned about mental illness and became an expert at faking insanity . Yochelson and Samenow studied more than too hard-core criminals who had been adjudicated " not guilty by reason of insanity , " and concluded that not a single diagnosis stood up . Behind the criminal big-man pose , Yochelson and Samenow discovered a weak , even cowardly individual . His parents may remember that in early life he was the one who needed the night light longest , was the least tolerant of pain , most afraid of the doctor , thunder , heights , goblins , of getting hurt in a fight . Yet most overcome their fears because of a greater fear of a put- 1978 THE CRIMINAL MIND : A STARTLING NEW LOOK  | down by others . And each develops : i " cutoff " mechanism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goes after the excitement of crime . Perhaps the most surprising findmg of Yochelson and Samenow is t hat every single one of their 252 con men , robbers and killers regarded himself as a decent , kind , good person . Typically , he and his colleagues will stop to help an old lady cross the street on their way to an Armed robbery , and give their loot to needy friends . The good deed helps corrode internal deterrents and enables them to feel better about carrying out their crimes . Program for Change . By 1972 , Yochelson and Samenow had made one basic assumption that radically departs from conventional psychological and sociological thinking : The criminal can and does choose his way of life freely in his quest for power , control and excitement . Moreover , he can choose to change if he musters courage or will to endure the consequences of responsible choices . To emphasize the rationality of their approach , Yochelson and Samenow quit thinking of themselves as " therapists " and began calling themselves " teachers . " Their goal : to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ youngsters automatically acquire by the time they reach the third grade . " Our position is unapologetically moralistic , " they proclaimed . Changing a criminal 's thought patterns is a long and tedious process . In the initial interview , his new teacher wades right in with a detailed profile of the hard-core criminal , including the fearfulness , the lying , stealing and cheating from an early age . Striving hard to enhance the criminal 's self-disgust , he describes the people the criminal has victimized . For most , it is the first time they feel flatly confronted with the accusation that they are criminal . They hear themselves described the way they know they are inside . The teacher ends with a stern message : " You 've got just three choices ? jail , suicide or change . And we are your lifeline because we can show you how to change . Take it or leave it . " Most , in fact , leave it . In the first four years , only 30 , fewer than half of those offered the opportunity , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hopeful conclusion : if a criminal adheres to the program 's requirements , it is impossible for him not to achieve basic change . Indeed , by May 1976 , 13 of the 30 hard-core criminals processed were living responsible lives as jobholders , husbands , parents , substantially meeting all 37 of the YochelsonSamenow criteria of successful change . Many of the others would be judged successes by the traditional rehabilitation criteria of holding jobs and avoiding re-arrest . They fall short principally in such matters as mishandling money , using alcohol excessively , frequent job " ' changes , irresponsible sex . " I Feel Clean ! " The reform program involves the criminal on proba- tion or parole who , for a year , meets three hours a day , five days a week , with the teacher and two or three other participants . He must forgo alcohol and remain faithful to his wife or girlfriend . He must find himself a job ? usually a menial job at night , since he must attend his half-day sessions ? and he must tell his employer of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has each day , and each report begins with a review of what the criminal learned the day before . If he backslides or cheats , the teacher soon becomes aware of it via his own checklist or talks with family or employer . Then the criminal 's parole or probation is revoked . When the criminal comes to the program , he has to wean himself from the high-voltage jolts he got out of crime to a steady current of satisfactions from self-respect and responsible living . Craving excitement , he creates withdrawal pains : dizziness , headaches , gastrointestinal upsets , palpitations , sweating , sleeplessness , crying . But he learns . One criminal went through a weekend of crying and insomnia but reported something new on Monday : " I feel refreshed ; I feel a sense of cleanliness . " As time goes on , the 37-point " checklist for change " enables the teacher to tell when the criminal really reshapes his world . THE PIONEERING WORK of Yochelson. ( who died in November 1976 ) a Samenow has stirred hot controversy , for it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ criminal behavior , offends liberal social scientists w believe that crime comes from 1 treatment and poverty . But it won high praise as well . Says Robert B. Mills , psychology professor in t University of Cincinnati 's crimin justice programs : " The Criminal sonality gives correctional counsel . a blueprint to begin the serious work of rehabilitation . " Samenow plans new research in the hard-core criminal 's early phas - He proposes a series of pilot pr . grams to further develop and test t change process ? community clinic with several teacher-and-aide tea each handling up to a dozen parol criminals at once . But , he stresse those who do not join the program or who try to con their teacher mu have probation or parole revoke and be sent to prison ? without lenience or sentimentality . For unless hard-core criminals are penned u and forced to face their alternative they will continue their predatory ways as long as they live . @#
