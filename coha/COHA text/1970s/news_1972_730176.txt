txt All that trash we 're so familiar with : Is it worthless ? The answer is no ? it can be recycled . The following article is part of the first of six detailed studies of what 's being done to recycle " waste " today . " Turn that garbage into gold ! " That 's today 's cry as increasing numbers of people recognize that trash simply is a resource out of place . Where this misplaced resource once was merely a nuisance , now it threatens society itself . The United States alone generates a mountainous 190 million tons of garbage a year currently and the figure is constantly expanding . Some estimates suggest it could be close to 290 million tons by 1980 . So ... old tires are being turned into oil liquids , gas , and tar under an experimental process now being investigated by the U.S. Interior Department 's Bureau of Mines . The bureau has also made oil from garbage ? something like 31 gallons of crude oil from a ton . Crushed glass into bricks . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . sawdust into hardboard . . . tree bark into a high-grade soil condi tioner . . . experiments doing all these things are under way in various places today . Such recycling is still in its infancy in the U.S. , experts say , although on a broad scale it is more advanced here than abroad . Nonetheless , limited as it may be , it is a beginning ? attracting more and more attention among businessmen , scientists , government officials , and even housewives . " Mountains of solid waste " is no descriptive exaggeration ; anyone who has visited the trash-disposal center of even a moderate-sized American city will vouch for its accuracy . In Illinois they are building an actual mountain out of the stuff . Mt . Trashmore they call it , and it 's destined to become a winter skiing resort and general recreation center in the not-too-distant future . In Holland the Dutch have long used garbage to add hilly contours to the recreation areas of their largely flat land . Pollution also is spurring this recycling campaign . The world 's resources @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole world with tin , they can be exhausted . Eventual shortages are predicted in known reserves for oil , timber and many minerals ? even water . More oil , coal , and gas has been used in the past 30 years than in all history before that time ; more materials have been mined , - manufactured and discarded since 1950 than the sum total of everything fabricated before then . * Please turn to first page , second section *Making use of trash // To quote the U.S. National Wildlife Federation : " Man is perhaps spending his mineral capital faster than any other resource . " If he continues to use known mineral reserves at the present rate , coal will last a further 300 years , some experts suggest . But crude-oil reserves will scarcely see him through the turn of the century ; natural gas will run out in half that time Aluminum ( 120 years ) , uranium ( 30 years ) , lead ( 50 years ) , and zinc ( 54 years ) are other important minerals that soon could be exhausted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known reserves may last . More effort toward solution Spurred on by these twin problems of mounting trash and an imminent shortage of taken-for-granted resources , man is at last devoting a small but increasing part of his technological know-how towards their solution . This series of articles will give some details . Experiments in progress include : The Department of the Interior 's Bureau of Mines has investigated what is termed the " destructive distillation " of old tires ; one reason is that the U.S. discards 100 million tires a year The process , which would convert them to oil liquids , gas , and tar , is " technically feasible , " according to Fire-stone 's Central Research Laboratory Oregon State University scientists are treating cellulose waste , which makes up about 70 percent of city trash today , with hydrogen . The end result could be hydrocarbon oils , useful both as fuel and lubricant Crushed glass can either be made into bricks or used to pave roads ( glasphalt they call it ) as well as make new bottles . The Bureau of Mines is investigating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . or cardboard or insulation . This is done commercially in a number of areas . Farm yields increase In some instances ground rubber from old tires has increased agricultural yields ; the experimental dumping of old tires to form reefs off Florida 's east coast is attracting fish to the area . Japanese fishermen have done the same using old car wrecks . At the same time recycling metals from junked cars is becoming increasingly efficient . Sawdust , once a waste that had to be burned , has long been turned into newsprint and hardboard in many countries . Chemicals / also can be extracted from it . Technology also exists to convert yesterday 's city garbage into tomorrow 's structural timber There are still innumerable problems to be overcome ? mainly in finding a use for some of the salvaged materials . Also , in refining the experiment to commercially viable form . But there are some hopeful signs ? and some dedicated , innovative pioneers who are charting the course .                @ @ @ @ @
