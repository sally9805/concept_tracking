Notes and Comment FIVE thousand people , the most excited crowd that has hit Kennedy Airport since the Beatles came to New York in 1964 to do " The Ed Sullivan Show , " mobbed the New York Cosmos , the new champions of the North American Soccer League , when they flew back to town last week after squeezing by the Seattle Sounders in Soccer Bowl ' 77 , in Portland , Oregon , and suddenly the whole town was talking soccer , although not very knowledgeably . Two days later , the Cosmos set off on a world tour that will take them to Venezuela , Japan , and China , among other places , and they left behind them a lot of people trying to learn how to pronounce " Chinaglia " and " Dimitrijevic " ? the names of two Cosmos stars . Five years ago , when the Cosmos won the N.A.S.L. title for the first time , six thousand people showed up at Hofstra University for the game . Two years ago , when Pele played his first game for the Cosmos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Randall 's Island . Two weeks ago , when the Cosmos beat the Rochester Lancers in a semifinal game at Giants Stadium , in East Rutherford , New Jersey  --  Pele 's last official game in the New York area  --  only 3,222 people did n't show up for the game , a much more impressive statistic than the total number of tickets sold : 76,891 . Rain from a junior hurricane battered the stadium throughout the first half of the game , and , although very few seats in the stadium have any protection from the elements , 73,669 people sat through the storm . We were there among the soaked for a closer look at this sudden new outburst of affection , and , having worked closely with the fans in our immediate area of the stadium  --  a sportswriter friend ; an Ivy League couple from Short Hills ; a large Hungarian family from Union City ; three teenage girls from Manhattan ; and Dante Tegeti , a designer-arranger of flora centerpieces from Union City ( Tegeti won second prize in that night 's Tailgate Competition with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mockup of a soccer goal , a small black cannon firing soccer halls at the goal , a sign that said " GOALS COSMOS GOALS , " a sign that said " COSMOS POWER " spelled out in plastic roses , and a big sign that said " COSMONAUTS " with the " A " crossed out ) ? we can now offer the following definitive , if slightly contradictory , explanations of soccermania ' 7 7 : * Yankees fans love the Cosmos because the Cosmos management spent millions of dollars this year to sign up the best players in the world , and the best players in the world spent the first half of the season squabbling among themselves but then started to play well and got into the playoffs anyway . * Mets , Knicks , Nets , Rangers , Jets , and Giants fans love the Cosmos because they started to play well and got into the playoffs , period . * Islanders Fans love the Cosmos because they love a winner . * New Jerseyans love the Cosmos because they have n't had a national @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cosmos because they 're not sure that soccer is a sport . * Kids love the Cosmos because they 're now playing soccer . Schools have been turning to soccer as a result of budget slashing . Football equipment is very expensive , and to play soccer all you need is a ball with spots on it and a field . * Girls love the Cosmos because girls can play soccer , too  --  with boys and almost as well as boys . Soccer is nonviolent , and when you do knock somebody down you pick him up again immediately and pat him on the back of the head . *Prep-school graduates love soccer because they used to play it in school . * All first-generation Americans me , . cans love soccer because it is the most important game everywhere else in the world  --  the planetary pastime . * The cost-of-living-conscious love soccer because professional-soccer tickets are a third to a half less than professional-football tickets . * North American Soccer League franchise owners love soccer because its worldwide salary levels are a lot lower than the salary levels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . * Sports fans in general love soccer because the game is easy to follow . The action never stops , and the action always comes directly to the ball , because someone 's always kicking it . So all you have to do is follow the hall and you know exactly what 's going on . Also , play flows all over the field , * The Cosmos are all colorful personalities . Franz Beckenba tier and Giorgio Chinaglia , formerly the greatest players in Germany and Italy , both had to leave their native lands surreptitiously after signing with the Cosmos to avoid the wrath of their former fans . Shep Messing , the Cosmos goalie , is a local  --  a Bronx-horn Harvard grad who posed for a Viva centerfold. * Pele , the Black Pearl , the King of Soccer , is irresistible . Finding Things to Say FINE printers  --  which means in the printing trade printers who make a living from the business , or want to , but to whom money is less important than craftsmanship , artistry of design , and scholarship about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their great predecessors of the last five hundred years get recognition from their col-leagues and from hook collectors , and ( necessarily , it may be ) almost no acknowledgment from readers . That 's because when a fine printer has done his work satisfactorily a reader can absorb the resulting text without thinking about how it is printed , and only a part of his mind which has nothing to do with storing information or delighting in a tale will notice that the paper is pleasant to feel and to look at , that the type is black and its edges are so sharp and clean that they might have been chiselled into the page , that there is enough space between words and between lines to allow the eyes to record words with maximum efficiency , and that a wide margin at the bottom of a page has the subtle effect of making the writing look like something the writer is giving the reader which may be of use , and not like something the reader ought to read for his own good . Joseph Blumenthal , who , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fine printer in the country today , has been thanked by at least two notable authors  --  Franklin Roosevelt , when Blumenthal 's Spiral Press designed the typography and layout of the first five volumes of " The Public Papers and Addresses of Franklin D. Roosevelt , " for Random House , in 1938 , and Robert Frost , when the Spiral Press first designed one of his books , the " Collected Poems " of 1930 . ( Frost has been called " the hest-printed poet in America , " for previous hooks of his had been laid out by other great modern printers , like Daniel Berkeley Updike , Bruce Rogers , and William A. Dwiggins . ) F.D.R. , who was himself something of a bibliophile , inscribed a volume of his papers , " To Joseph Blumenthal , A-1 Designer , from his friend , Franklin D. Roosevelt . " Frost inscribed a copy of his poems , " To Joseph Blumenthal , who thus in pure bookmaking ( nothing added ) found things to say that were never said before to my poetry . " Blumenthal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Press , which he closed in 1971 after forty-five years , the last twenty-five of them in a building on West Thirty-first Street , opposite the General Post Office . The National Institute of Arts and Letters once adopted a formal resolution of commendation of Blumenthal after he designed a letterhead for the American Institute of Arts and Letters ; and the printer 's mark of the Spiral Press , a swirling , three-tendrilled Norse niskelion , is carved- along with William Caxton 's initials and a dolphin twined around an anchor , which is the mark of Aldus Manutius -- in the wooden molding of the walls of one of the Pierpont Morgan Library 's rooms , in a sequence commemorating sixteen of the great printers of all time . The most useful tribute was a continuing one : the Spiral Press , ever since it was commissioned back in 1926 by Henry Holt &; Company to design and set the title pages for a series of books , had always attracted enough business to stay in business . As Blumenthal noted in 1966 in " The Spiral Press Through Four Dec @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ designed and printed , his press " thrived in its modest way from the beginning . " The Spiral Press designed monographs , catalogues , letterheads , and hillheads for Steuben Glass ; annual reports , catalogues , and invitations for the Morgan Library ; and catalogues , announcements , stationery , and programs for the Frick Museum . It produced more than a million Christmas cards a year over many years for the Metropolitan Museum of Art , and it was responsible for books , booklets , circulars , and bookplates ( amounting to well over ten thousand different jobs of work ) for a variety of bookshops , art galleries , museums , libraries , university presses , foundations , clubs , and collectors , and for a few industrial firms and trade publishers --  hand-setting , for instance , the title pages of some books for Random House . Four years ago , Blumenthal chose a hundred and twenty-nine hooks , principally from the Morgan Library , for an exhibition of masterpieces of typography through five centuries and then wrote and designed the book that accompanied the show as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1455-1955 " ? which is now used by many colleges as a text . This year , Blumenthal has a new book out ? " The Printed Book in America , " published by David R. Go-dine , of Boston , in association with the Dartmouth College Library . It contains his history of fine printing in this country ' since the Glover family brought the first printing press to Massachusetts , in 1638 , and his personal selection of the seventy best books printed in America in three hundred and thirty-nine years , and it was prepared in conjunction with a Dartmouth-sponsored travelling exhibition of the seventy books , which is now at Cornell , is soon to move on to the Bancroft Library at Berkeley , and will come to New York in early 1978 . There was an unusual champagne party for Blumenthal at Dartmouth back in May , when Blumenthal 's exhibition opened there  --  unusual in that it was attended not only by Blumenthal 's publishers ( Godine and Edward Connery Lathem , Dean of Libraries and Librarian of Dartmouth , who presented Blumenthal with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also by Blumenthal 's printers ( Roderick Stinehour , of the Stinehour Press , in Lunenburg , Vermont , whose work is represented in one of the plates of " The Printed Book in America , " and Harold Hugo , of the Meriden Gravure Company , in Meriden , Connecticut ) . Printers almost invariably skip publication parties . Blumenthal made a short speech , saying , " Well , I thank you all very much . " Blumenthal spends most of his time these days at a country place he has in West Cornwall , Connecticut  --  he wrote " The Printed Book in America " there , after putting in two and a half years of research for it in the Dartmouth Library , the Beinecke Library , at Yale , the Columbia University Library , and the New York Public Library  --  but he also has an apartment in Chelsea , and when he was in town one day recently we had lunch with him at his favorite Chinese restaurant on West Twenty-third Street , near his apartment . He said he was pleased at the number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been entering the field of fine printing  --  the 1977 Western Books exhibition , for instance , lie said , displayed works by a dozen or so small presses and printers , some of them showing for the first time . Since January of 1975 , he added , there has been a good magazine  --  Fine Print ; Review for the Arts of the Book  --  just for friends of fine printing . We asked Blumenthal how he approaches a piece of work . " Craftsmanship has always been the core , " he said . " And I 've always devoted a maximum of effort to every job , big or small , profitable or not , from a book to a business card . The finished product , I hope , displays the kind of ease and serenity to be found in Bruce Rogers ' work . Frost said of any kind of work that if it shows the agony it 's no good . And Rogers , after he had spent a year designing a folio lectern Bible for the Oxford University Press  --  King George V @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cana dians had built for their dead at Ypres  --  said something I have always found especially cogent : ' I had decided in the beginning that notwithstanding its size of page the composition should not be ponderous or too formal ? " monumental , " I believe is the word for the appearance I wished to avoid . I wanted this book to appear as though I were accustomed to knocking off folios daily , or at least weekly , as mere routine work . ' " Forsythia NOT long ago , on a flawless and pristine day , the lunchtime crowds coursing along Fifth Avenue and enjoying the gleam had little , if any , idea that farther uptown our friends the bird-watchers of Central Park were about to make another small but solid contribution to the quality of life in this city : forsythia bushes The bushes numbered eight , cost about two hundred dollars ( paid for out of bird-watcher pockets ) , and would he planted in a badly walked-over area of the Park 's Ramble known as the Top of the Point , which has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Park Task Force , a privately funded organization that helps maintain the Park 's landmarks and natural features , would provide the muscle , in the form of twenty teen-age interns . We had been told to report around noon for the hush-planting . We entered the Park from East Seventy-second Street , and walked past the boat basin and past sunbathers basking on a hill . At the Top of the Point , the bird-watchers and the Task Force interns were mingling in a friendly fashion , though each group could be easily identified . The bird-watchers carried binoculars and were neatly dressed , fifties style . The interns carried shovels and wore the gray flannels of adolescence  --  jeans , sneakers , and T-shirts ( green , emblazoned in white with " Central Park Task Force/ I Love New York " ) . The area to be planted was a bald patch of hard-packed dirt ; its forlorn appearance suggested that a great deal of activity had occurred there . A slender bird-watcher with a mustache approached us and extended a fist full of money . " Look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people contribute money for those bushes but someone has just suggested that we collect more money for more bushes . In no time at all , seventeen dollars . " Another bird-watcher , a white-haired , white-bearded man in a brown canvas hat , came up to us and identified himself as Lambert Pohner . Mr. Pohner carried a piece of white paper folded lengthwise . He opened it carefully , lifted a protective sheet of waxed paper , and gave us a look at two stalks of grass . " Weeds , " we said . " Crabgrass , " he said , " This is digitaria sanguinalis on the left . This is digitaria ischaemun on the right . Both are indigenous to the area . Have you talked with any of Miss Wiley 's girls ? " We recognized the name of Farida A. Wiley , Honorary Associate in Natural Science Education at the Museum of Natural History , who has been leading nature walks in the Park for many years . Mr. Pohner pointed out a group of three women who were watching the hush-planning activities from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for by now the Task Force interns were busy watering the forsythia bushes , and each other ) . We went over to them . One woman had white hair and slate-blue eyes , and wore blue trousers and a striped shirt ; the next was tall and slim , wearing a snappy brown print dress ; the third wore a blue print dress and was sitting On a large rock , holding a single stalk of what we believed was digitaria ischaemun . They all appeared to be in their sixties , and they all cherish their anonymity . " Sometimes there are as man as fifty people who go out with Miss Wiley on her morning walks , " said the woman in the striped shirt . " If there are no birds , she knows the trees and the rocks and the rills , and so it is always worthwhile . " Blue Dress : " She pays absolutely no attention to weather . " Striped Shirt : " It can be coining down in pellets . " Brown Dress : " In buckets . " Striped Shirt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same freshness to everything . " Blue Dress : " Miss Wiley sidled up to me the other day and said , ' It has been about fifty years since I started going on these walks . ' I ca n't believe it . " Striped Shirt : " We worship her . " Blue Dress : " I 'll use the new expression . She is something else . " We left as the Task Force interns began to pack up their equipment . A few bird-watchers were staying on for a picnic lunch . Retracing our steps , we walked along an asphalt path that curved sharply east and led down toward the boathouse . The Park was a vivid , end-of-summer green . There were no birds , but we kept an eye out for the trees , the rocks , and the rills . The Man Himself SOME of the best dancersin the city , including former Harvest Moon Ball champions and past Roseland instructors , follow a social-dancing circuit that takes them every Friday and Saturday night to one or more of five places : Mickey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dance Studio , on Broadway at Eighty-seventh Street ; the Darian Dance Studio , in Bay Ridge ; the Phillips School of Dancing , also in Bay Ridge ; and the Phillips Dance Studios , in the north Bronx . The five are distinguished by the fact that all of them have teachers who are former students  --  more accurately , disciples  --  of Johnny Phillips . Clearly , most of the addresses that the dancers flock to are a little off the beaten track , but all these studios nevertheless attract what is called " the regular crowd " of dancers , because that means Phillips dancers . Saturday-night socials for dance students area Phillips tradition , and they still feature some of New York 's most accomplished dancers , who prefer the smaller studios to showy Roseland . The Phillips studio in the Bronx is one of six Phillips dance studios to have been established since 1940 , and one of two that still bear the name of the man generally regarded as New York 's preeminent social-dance instructor . The Bronx studio is on the upper floor of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fordham Road and Walton Avenue , above Sterling Optical and on the same landing as the Household Finance Corporation , the Snelling &; Snelling Personnel Agency of the Bronx , and Sterling Referral . The interior walls of the building are uniformly painted in a yellow high-gloss terracotta swirl , and the floors are a field of salt-and-pepper tile . The doors to most of the small business offices have chipped gold lettering on dusty frosted glass . At night , only the Phillips studio 's thin red neon shines out to the street on the darker Walton Avenue side ; a muffled hum of music can be heard in the hallways . On a recent Saturday night , we were greeted at the Phillips studio by Alex Trepp , the studio director , who is a man of medium height and build , with a peak of wavy brown hair , black-framed glasses , and a radio announcer 's push behind his speech . " Johnny Phillips stands above them all , " he declared as he shook our hand . " Glad you could make it tonight . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it 's rare that he comes back . But he 'll be here tonight ! Everyone 's looking for him . " Indeed , a studio flyer that goes out to all Phillips Saturday-night-social regulars had announced an appearance by " The Man Himself , " and on this particular Saturday night the studio was jammed with well over a hundred Phillips alumni and current Phillips students . " It 's really incredible how they keep coming back for more , " Mr. Trepp said . Mr. Trepp graciously offered us the freedom of the house while he attended to incoming guests . " Look , it 's all there , and dance if you want to . Come on ! " He slapped us good-naturedly on the shoulder and made off . The place certainly was buzzing with people and crowded with things to study . On the wall by the entrance , there was a dazzling display of vintage record covers , tacked up diagonally : covers like " Red , Hot and Cha Cha Cha , " which pictured a Latin siren wearing a Technicolor-red leotard that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a conga drum slung across her poised body ; and " Full House , " featuring the dance orchestras of Al Castellanos , Sonny Rossi , Johnny Conquet , and Joe Cuba , and the La Playa Sextet . In front of the wall display were two wire racks , one holding similarly bold-colored record jackets , and the other supporting a mobile that advertised " Glamor Shoe Supports  --  Holds Shoe Firmly and Comfortably to Your Foot . " To the right of the racks , a very blond woman named Dolores ( " Call me Dec , " she said with a little toss of her shoulder ) sat behind a panelled counter where a three-dollar social fee was collected . Behind her hung a black " menu board , " with movable white letters that spelled out an extremely active weekday and weekend schedule at the studio . Across from the counter was an open-ended closet in which coats and jackets hung on two parallel racks ; piled high on shelves above the racks were shoe-boxes with dancers ' names written on them . Passing between the racks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shiny-planked dance floor , mirrors lining the back wall , and several couples twirling furiously in front of them . " We 're all ex-Mamboniks from the Mambo Palace ! " a gray-haired man in a flowered shirt and white shoes shouted to us as he moved easily through some quick steps and sways . " Now and forever ! " We went on into a middle room , a good-sized lounge with several groups of end tables and love seats , and with a giant vinyl hassock in the center of the room , under a nineteen-fiftiesmodern ceiling-hung lamp . This room led to the front dance room  --  usually divided into two separate dance-instruction chambers by a wooden accordion curtain , which had been drawn back for the evening get-together  --  and yet another room , to the right , in which there was a long table with good cookies , little cakes , and plenty of coffee . This room was diagonally opposite the lounge . From it one could study , centered on one wall of the lounge , a large impressionistic painting of a formally dressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mr. Trepp appeared , to explain , " That was made from a photograph of my wife and me during our first Harvest Moon Ball 1946 . Her gown cost three hundred and fifty dollars to make , which in those days was a real pile of wood . " Mr. Trepp introduced us to Velia Santoro , the coach of the East Coast International Amateur Latin Dance Champions , and to John Nyemchek and Kathy Cobelli , who were going to offer an exhibition of their skills for Mr. Phillips . Miss Santoro was in charge of coordinating the music for the entire evening from a cramped booth , in a corner of the lounge , that was packed with stereo equipment , tape decks , tapes , and records and had a microphone connected to speakers throughout the studio . " You know , " said Mr. Trepp , " it was Johnny Phillips who actually established the basis for the choreography at the Harvest Moon Ball competition , starting with the year he won the all-around championship 1939 . He made it much more beautiful for competition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Velia Santoro . " So rare . " Standing by the front-room doorway , we watched the smartly dressed dancers pivot and glide and execute idiosyncratic steps . We learned that good dancers never leave the dance floor without a comment . " This is a great tempo , Velia , but you should have played it later , " said a natty middle-aged man in a custom-made sports jacket with lapels as wide as late-fifties Chevrolet fins . " Nobody does a quickstep like me ! " said a small , energetic man who looked like Louie Dumbrowsky , the ice-cream-store proprietor in Bowery Boys movies . " %Vhy ca n't you stand straight ? " said one woman to her slumping dance partner . We paused for a moment at the coffee bar and chatted with Maxwell Emery , a twenty-three-year General Motors man in a sports jacket of wild Madras plaid , who turned our to he quite a Phillips man as well . " In 1943 , I wanted to learn the Lindy , so I joined the Phillips Studio , " he said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was in his classes for twenty-five years . I was in his class on Seventy-second Street , on Eighty-third Street , on Eighty-ninth Street on the East Side , and on Eighty-seventh Street on the West Side . I used to follow Johnny Phillips , but since he retired Igo where the dancers go . " At that moment , we noticed a tall man in a black suit , whose movements were conspicuously smooth , walking around and greeting people in the lounge . He lied strikingly good posture . His how to the seated ladies was not ceremonious but understated and correct . His black suit seemed very black . The dance floor thinned out a bit , and people who had been standing at the coffee bar milled by the doorway . Mr. Trepp waved us over to the black-suited man . " This is Johnny Phillips , " he said , and we shook hands . Phillips , a distinguished-looking man in his middle sixties , was several inches taller than most of the guests , and he seemed to stand even taller than that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had a high forehead and a trim , downward-pointing mustache . " Quite a following you 've got here , " we said . " Oh , yes , " he replied quietly . He sat down on one of the love seats , and we sat down beside him and asked how he had become interested in dancing . " Well , my older brother used to go to dances at the Brooklyn Y , and at that time the foxtrot , waltz , tango , and rumba were popular , " he said . " When he finally took me along to one of them , I found I had a flair for dancing . Then it was more social . Later , I got interested in exhibition . I was twenty-two or twenty-three , working as a shipping clerk , and I 'd just broken tip with my dance partner , when I saw this lady at the Harvest Moon Bail competition . I thought she was a beautiful dancer . Her name was Margo Sage . I went to the Harvest Moon Bail with Margo Sage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , tango , rumba , and waltz , and won the All-Around Championship . Later , we split up , and the last I heard of her , she had married into wealth and was living in California . After the 3939 Ball , I was Dance Director at Roseland for two years  --  which was important , because when you 're known as a dancer at Roseland you 've made the grade . In the meantime , I had gotten married , and my wife , Marie , and I gave exhibitions at the Havana Madrid , the La Conga , sometimes Roseland . We got a thrill out of introducing new dances  --  the Calypso , the bossa nova , and so on . When we were doing a show at the La Conga , I remember , there was a piece of new music called ' The Mambo Bop , ' and we put a dance together for it , but it never amounted to anything . " He twirled his mustache for a moment . " To tell you truthfully , I never really enjoyed performing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freeze , even after a terrific rehearsal . But everything I did was For the school . We did shows at various night clubs , where we introduced group dancing , changing partners while we danced , and I began group instruction at the school , too . Soon the school became very busy , and we eventual 's ' opened the branches ! ' We asked Mr. Phillips how he accounted for such a loyal following . " People always talk about the Phillips method or the Phillips system , but we never really had a formal method , " he said . " I 'd take a young fellow out of the group lessons , a fellow with talent , who loved dancing , and let him do with the group what he wanted . Nothing special was required  --  not even special shoes . I 've danced in everything , including brogues . ' Walk your way to better dancing ' is what I 've always said . Back then , when I first began , the others would n't listen to me , but now it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  that 's where you pre-land and point . You actually step on your heel first , and then point with your toe . Heel and toe , heel and toe . " He demonstrated for us by waggling his shiny black Florsheims . " The basic idea is to feel very tall out there . Take control of your dance , and make it feel your rhythm . " A couple spun out of the rear dance room and continued spinning toward the front room in a succession of tight circles . " Watch it , Johnny , I 've got my eye on your ' a woman with a beehive hairdo called out across the room . Mr. Phillips seemed a little embarrassed . He lit a cigarette . " I 've been out of the business for a few years now , " he said . " Blood pressure , and so on . I 've only danced two numbers in the last two years If I ca n't be in it , I do n't want to he around it . But seeing this tonight makes me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Phillips excused himself and rose to shake hands with several couples who were milling closely around us , and soon a fairly long line of dancers was waiting to greet him . " He 's responsible for a lot of people 's good years , " said Frances Horowitz , who , with her husband , Harold , was standing near the end of the line . It was growing quite late , yet the Horowitzes seemed content to wait in line and allow each dancer his full share of time with Johnny Phillips .
