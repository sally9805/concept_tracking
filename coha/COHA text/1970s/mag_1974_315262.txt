Pittsburgh Steeler Running Back Franco Harris coolly surveyed the pond and the line of trees guarding the 557-yd. , par-five hole ahead . Then he belted the ball off the tee with all the power of Jack Nicklaus-but none of the accuracy . Far , far away , the ball hit the roof of a private home . After half a dozen more errant drives , course officials set a limit of twelve strokes per hole and charitably awarded Harris a mere triple bogey for his ordeal . " This is n't my game , " he muttered . <P> Which was exactly the point . Franco and eleven other " superstars " were competing last week in the finals of a bastardized decathlon . No one is allowed to play in his own specialty . The rewards : a $1,000 guarantee , a shot at $122,000 in prize money and some laughs in the Florida sunshine . Filmed and broadcast by ABC , the series has shot to the top of the Sunday afternoon ratings this winter . <P> The presence of twelve big-name athletes sent Rotonda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allowed swarms of children to join the athlete hunt . Commercial sponsors flew in a small army of star-struck clients and customers to hobnob with the captive athletes at a poolside cocktail party . With the arrival of Howard Cosell , the stage was finally fully populated for a genuine pseudo event . <P> The action started on the tennis court , where Cincinnati Reds Leftfielder Pete Rose stole the show if not the prize . He overcame his lack of experience - only four months on the court-to beat Austrian Skier Karl Schranz . " This game 's like badminton , " Rose declared happily after taking one game from Schranz by diving across the court to make an impossible forehand return . <P> After the general debacle on the golf course-won by Miami Dolphin Safety Dick Anderson , who finished near par - the athletes moved to the swimming pool . Boston Celtic Star John Havlicek immediately complained about his lane assignment next to Shotputter Brian Oldfield ( ' I 'll drown in the tidal wave he creates " ) . After two laps , Oldfield surfaced gasping and decided to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a pole vaulter by profession , and Kyle Rote Jr. , son of the former New York Giants split end and a professional soccer star in his own right . Rote won by a hair . <P> The second day of competition began with the 100-yd. dash and the half-mile run . With the palm trees looking like a mirage in the unseasonable 35 chill , OJ . Simpson jogged around the asphalt track repeating one thought : " Man , it 's cold . The Juice may just not run in that 880.1 do n't want to die down here . " Simpson did run in the 100-yd. dash and with his sprinter 's speed easily beat Seagren . When the 880 began , O.J. , true to his word , was seated in a warm car and Seagren defeated Anderson in the comparatively respectable time of 2 min. 11 sec.
