U.S. doctors have for years fought to keep the Federal Government from ruling on what is necessary , proper care . In the most recent defense of their professional prerogative , the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons had gone to court to block enforcement of a new Social Security amendment that will monitor the treatment given Medicare and Medicaid patients . The doctors argued that such a system violated their constitutional right to practice medicine and their patients ' right to receive treatment . <P> Last week the U.S. Supreme Court disagreed with that view . It let stand a lower-court decision upholding the Social Security legislation . The court 's decision means that the Federal Government may now order the formation of Professional Standards Review Organizations ( P.S.R.O.s ) to review medical procedures in individual cases and decide if the treatments prescribed by physicians receiving federal payment conform to generally accepted standards . Though doctors will be unhappy about P.S.R.O.s , they will probably not pull out of the Medicare and Medicaid programs , which provide a major share of some physicians ' incomes .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
