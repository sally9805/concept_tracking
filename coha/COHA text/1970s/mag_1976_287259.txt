It could have been , scarcely a decade ago , a pious Roman Catholic Mass , just the sort of loyal demonstration to gladden the heart of a Pope distressed by the faithlessness of the modern world . The worshipers had come early to the auditorium in the northern French city of Lille ; while a choir chanted medieval Latin hymns , the congregation quickly filled 5,700 seats and spilled out into the aisles . Then the celebrant of the Mass entered , a pink-cheeked , white-haired priest who moved solemnly up the aisle behind a quartet of acolytes bearing lighted candles . <P> But the words from the altar were anything but pious or loyal . Instead , the priest , Roman Catholic Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre , 70 , coolly denounced the Vatican for having entered an " adulterous marriage " with " revolution and subversion . " As a result , charged the prelate , " The rite of Mass today is a bastard rite . The sacraments today are bastard sacraments . We want to have prayers like our ancestors . We want to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remonstrations , Lefebvre began the Mass in Latin , according to the four-century-old Tridentine rite , now superseded and banned by Rome. * <P> Despised Reforms . For Lefebvre and his followers , the new Mass promulgated by Pope Paul in 1969 is a symbol of the changes embodied in the reforms of the Second Vatican Council-reforms that they despise . Among other objections , Lefebvre contends that the use of vernacular languages instead of Latin has broken down Catholic unity . In addition to the Mass , Lefebvre demands a return to the " true Bible , " the Latin Vulgate of St. Jerome , instead of dangerous " ecumenical " versions . He excoriates progressive interpretations of church doctrine . " If I had done earlier what they teach priests in seminaries to do now , I would have been excommunicated , " he lamented in his sermon last week . " If I had taught then the catechisms they teach now , they would have called me a heretic . " <P> Ironically , until recently the Vatican had long considered Lefebvre an exemplary missionary and a pastoral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industrialists near Lille , he was ordained in 1929 and spent 30 years in Africa , where he became Archbishop of Dakar . But he had difficulty adjusting to the changes that swept Africa in the 1960s , when many colonies won independence , and he was transferred back to France . After a brief stint as bishop of Tulle , he was appointed head of a missionary order , the Fathers of the Holy Spirit . When the order 's general assembly voted a series of reforms , Lefebvre resigned , charging that " democratization " of the church was the work of Satan . Six years ago he founded a seminary at Econe , Switzerland , dedicated to the training of traditionalist priests who would function as though Vatican II had never taken place . <P> Despite the Vatican 's disapproval and finally its order last year to dissolve the seminary , Lefebvre continued to operate it . His defiance came to a head this past June when Lefebvre , once again disregarding Vatican orders , ordained 13 priests and 13 sub-deacons . In July the Vatican announced that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him from saying Mass , administering the sacraments and preaching . Disregarding the suspension , Lefebvre went ahead with the Lille Mass last week .
