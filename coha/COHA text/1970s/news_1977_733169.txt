txt THERE IS A tide In the affairs of men which causes the drains to back up , and then all the low-rent demogogs emerge from beneath the ground and flood the streets with swill . This is such a time h Chicago . It began with an AI Capp character named Frank Collin , who combs his hair and his mind to the side like Adolf Hitler . Collin is the kind of guy who used to eat erasers in class and roll his eyeballs up into his head to get attention . Today he 's the Fuhrer of 71st Street . Not long ago , Collin had the grotesque Idea that his Nazis should march on the heavily Jewish suburb of Skokie on the Fourth of July . Now , it 's an axiom of life that even lunatics , crackpots , and fanatics have a loyal opposition . Attention-hungry fringe people all need each other . It is the ecology of the anthill . SO COLLIN 'S threat to march into Skokie brought this opposition out in force to protect the Jews of Skokie from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Worker Laborites and Labor Socialites and others who just enjoy dressing up like Woodie Guthrie . And it brought out the Rev. C. H. Turner , founder of the Martin Luther King Jr . Movement , who has made it his mission in life to be fortuitously stopped by police before he and his followers can make it into Marquette Park for an open housing march . And it brought out Rabbi Meir Kahane , founder of the Jewish Defense League . Kahane most recently has been driving the Israeli government crazy by trying to start brawls with Arabs on the West Bank . He was just about washed up in the U. S. before Frank Collin gave him new life . SO HERE they all were Monday in the noontime Skokie sun conducting a humid watch on the Rhine . R did n't seem to matter that Collin and his pimply Nazis had stayed home . What mattered was there were scared people to exploit . Yes , scared people . Because some Jewish people frighten easily . Other peoples came to the United States because the potatoes had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or because a king had issued a proclamation and they 'd been thrown off their land . But Jews always have come to this country because they were being killed . NOW THEY ARE here , in America , the old ones and the offspring who 've heard all the stories . Here where governments do n't order wholesale slaughter . Where sons arid daughters are n't torn from their grasp . Where mobs seeking scapegoats do n't come screaming and burning and murdering people in their beds and shops . They are here , safe and secure , and then the Fuhrer of 71st Street had to come along . They can not see him for what he is ; a guy who 'd eat erasers and roll his eye ? balls , a twisted man whose own father is a survivor of a Nazi concentration camp . They see him , at least the old ones do , as a living nightmare , a hand extended across 35 years of thno to finally clutch their shoulders . And so scared people , 500 of them , // Close-up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come to the parking lot of the Bernard Harwich Jewish Community Center in Skokie Monday noon to hear Heir ICahane . A CHARTER bus was pulled along a fence . It bore some 100 young men from New York City , ' , some of them in fatigues , members of the Jewish Defense League . " We hope the Nazis will come out so we can break their heads , " said their chief of security , Simon Greenstein of Brooklyn . Ile is shortk.20 years old , and very angry . " I lost half of my family . in Poland . My father lost his first wife and a 9-month-old baby . He told me they came into the apartment and threw the baby from the fourth-floor window . Animals like this do n't deserve to be on the street . " A man With a thick accent was trying to eject twq young bearded men who carried socialist signs . " Get out of here , you not a Jew , " he shouted . The pair replied they were , and they intended to stay " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " /I FRIEND TRIED to calm the man down . " They are here to fight the fascist . That 's what we want to do , too , is n't it ; fight the fascist ? " The air was electric with discussion , Now the Defense League kids were chanting , as their drillmaster paraded up and.down in a ski mask despite the 95 degree heat . " What do we want ? " lie . yelled . " Nazis , " they replied/ " How de we want ' em ? " " Dead , " they answered . " Nazis dead . Nazis dead . Nazis dead , " The crowd nicked un the chant . A MAN In a yarmulke tells me it Is fitting that Kahane Is coming on July 4 , " the anniversary of the Entebbe raid , which has become a symbol of the new Jew . This is the Entebbe mentality , as opposed to the ghetto mentality . " Now Kahane arrives . Next to him is Rev. Turner , wearing a red fez . Ile looks like a Shriner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Turner , who is black , is telling Jews about " our forefathers who died in Nazi concentration camps " and the crowd is applauding him . " Let me hear you , " he yells . " The Nazis must go . Louder . The Nazis must go . " Now Kahane has the bullhorn . " Fifty years ago , a comical looking man with a comical looking moustache and 11 followers began an obscure movement in an obscure beer ball in Munich , " he says . " There were Jewish lawyers like David Goldberger of the American Civil Liberties Union who said let them march . " " The eleven became thousands , and from them came millions , and from the millions came the Holocaust , " Kahane says . " There will he no Nazis marching in Skokie , police or nor no police , " Kahane says . " Let us swear on this day that in a short time there will not be a Nazi office in Chicago . I give you my word , " Kahane shouts . Kahane is leading the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these middle class suburban Jews have their right fists upraised and clenched . A boy is sitting on his father 's shoulders and his fist is clenched . " Never again , " yells Moir Kahane . " Never again , " yells the crowd .
