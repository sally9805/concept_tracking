In her brief 33 years , Eva Pern traveled fast and far . The illegitimate daughter of a dirt farmer and a woman who ran a rooming house , she became the second wife of Argentine Dictator Juan Pern . With her expansive charity giveaways , Evita , as she was known to Argentina 's adoring masses , became a cult figure-the " Queen of the Descamisados " ( the shirtless ones ) . <P> Dignity . But Evita 's travels in life were nothing compared to her travels in death . On the night of Dec. 22 , 1955 , her body vanished from Buenos Aires ' central labor headquarters ; it had been placed there after she died of cancer in 1952 while a glass-enclosed mausoleum was being made ready . Rumors had her body thrown into the River Plate by the regime that ousted Pern . There was one report that 25 leading citizens were each given a sealed coffin , sworn to secrecy and asked to bury it . Each of the 25 believed that he alone had been entrusted with Evita 's body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body had been shipped to Rome disguised as that of a nun and buried in a cemetery there . As it turned out , that story came closest to the truth . The Argentine ambassador to Spain announced two weeks ago that Eva Pern 's body had been transferred from Italy and returned , as an act of " Christian dignity , " to Juan Pern , now 75 and living in exile in Spain with his third wife . The transfer was reportedly part of a political accommodation between the Peronistas , who are still the most vociferous political force in Argentina , and the military regime of General Alejandro Lanusse . <P> The story was pieced together from various sources last week . It appears that Evita 's body arrived in Milan on May 17 , 1957 , accompanied by Giuseppina Airoldi , a lay sister of the Company of St. Paul . Signora Airoldi believed the body to be that of an Italian woman who had died in Argentina-Maria Maggi , widow of Luigi De Magistris . The body was buried in Lot 86 , Garden 41 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Evita 's posthumous peregrinations began 14 years later . Last month a man calling himself Carlos Maggi , " brother " of the fictitious Maria , received permission for the exhumation and transport of Maria Maggi 's remains to Madrid . The coffin 's wooden casing was found to be rotting , but the coffin itself , reportedly of silver with a glass window showing the woman 's face , was in excellent condition . So was the corpse . After Evita 's death , Pern paid the famed Spanish pathologist Pedro Ara $100,000 to embalm her body the way the Russians had embalmed the remains of Lenin and Stalin . According to one witness , " the body was so natural that it looked like Evita was only asleep . " <P> Return . After paying a Milan funeral firm $1,280 in cash to transport the body to Spain , " Carlos Maggi " took his seat beside the funeral-van driver for the trip to Pern 's closely guarded house in a swank section on the outskirts of Madrid .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
