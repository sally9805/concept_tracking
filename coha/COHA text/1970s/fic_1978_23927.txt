MY FATHER , CONT . A story by Frederick Busch 1 F ANYTHING WAS GROWING just because it was March , it was growing under cover like the rest of us . Snow still rode the eaves and trembled in the skies , the banks of black-grained ice stood three feet tall at the sides of the roads and over all the lawns . But the calendar said spring , and the local newspapers said spring , and even the TV shows from New York , piped into Syracuse and Utica , then out among the small winding roads and old hills , to the brand-new pastel trailers and the old gray clapboard farmhouses  --  the farmers lived in the trailers ; the city people , in heralded perpetual retreat , lived in the farmers ' abandoned homes  --  said spring . What made it worse was that when all the official organs of the world 's conspiracy for early spring made their announcements , the Solsville Cooperative Nursery School Book Sale made theirs . When that happened . I kept my mouth shut tight . I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what parents did with kids when there was n't enough  --  and never mind what to go around . My father was a doctor and an ex-convict . That 's how he used to describe himself to people he had just met and had a couple of George Dickel sour mash whiskies with : " I 'm a doctor of children and an outcast of the people . I sat out the war because I did n't be-lieve in killing , and sometimes the care these troglodytes up here give their children is enough to drive me past Korea and my conscientious objection and into the pits of pure murder . " He had been divorced , and I had a couple of older half-sisters someplace in the Middle West . He had married a pretty young woman who wrote a children 's book when she was twenty and who never wrote a word again unless it was on a sign announcing a nursery school book sale or a rummage to benefit the local members of the Future Farmers of America . I was their issue , and I knew what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and my mother had just told him he should go upstairs to his study , an extra bedroom really , and take down his old paperback duplicate books and this year give in , for God 's sake , donate them to the Solsville Nursery School Book Sale and be charitable for once . " Listen , Edna , " my father 's voice said . It hummed on the floorboards upstairs in my room and poured up through the old-fashioned heating vents . It was Sunday , and I was waiting for the Celtics ' game , looking at the horrible illustrations in Hansel and Gretel , the story about the family with too little to eat . They kept taking the kids into the forest and leaving them there because there was n't enough to go around . It 's the saddest story about families . It 's the one that says hunger conies first . " Listen , Edna , " my father said , " I do n't mind taking their calls at six in the morning , and I do n't mind chugging out at midnight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treat their kids and wait three years for them to pay their bills . An right ? " " Hold it , Hank , " she said . She was closer to my age than his , I always thought , and smaller , like me , and nearly as smart as he was , which I was n't . She had also said , one night , when I could hear them , that if it was n't for me , she 'd be long gone from his bucolic infantilism . I did n't look it up , because I did n't want to know . But I was n't pleased with how things were going for us . My mother said , " You wo n't be giving your precious thirtyfive-cent paperbacks that are fifteen , twenty years old to the same pasty-faced potato-fat kickers you cure , Dr. Schweitzer . They do n't read , remember ? You 're giving books that will be sold by the nursery school so it can keep the profits and stay open another few months and take care of the children of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who nevertheless are the only friends you 've got . Remember ? " He did n't whine , but he seemed to , nearly , when he said , " Honey , it does n't /eel right to give my books away like that , " There was a little silence , and then she said , very low , " They 're my books , too . are n't they ? " And then another little silence , and then he said . " I 'll do it . Do that again , and I 'll do it . " And then another little silence and a long silence . I went back to Hansel and Greta The part where the father gives in and say , " Ah , but I shall regret the poor children . " L ATER ON , HE THUMPED up and down the creaky wooden stairs of the old farmhouse  --  in between the phone calls he always got on Sundays from patients who should have seen him on Friday or waited till Monday  --  and he carried some cartons of books out to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he loaded the old paperbacks into the car . I wondered if he was taking Won= of Rome , by Alberto Moravia , which stunned me , then , with its explicitness . I was bright , all right . I just was n't ready . And then I was watching a basketball game on TV because I had finished my schoolwork and needed something full of team spirit  --  Bob Cousy being given the ball because he was lighter than air and he glowed in the dark and he deserved the love he was getting . I did n't want to think anymore about Alberto Moravia , because I did n't understand what I was thinking . I did n't want to read anymore about those kids in the forest , because I did understand what I was thinking . And that 's why my heart was poisoned like a witch 's pancakes when my father said over drinks in the living room  --  I could hear him breaking their long silence which was hard on all three of us ? " Let 's go up into the hills , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming down yet . " I hoped that when my mother answered , " It 's too early , " he would drop the idea . She pushed him : " It 's too early for the deer to come down , Hank . What they want is corn stubble , and the fields are still covered with snow . And they sure do n't want more snow . They can get plenty of that up where they are . " As soon as he started to answer , I could tell from the swollen sound of his voice that she had made a big mistake . Cousy glided in from fifteen feet out , it felt like , for a slow-motion shot that made me hold my ears and shake my head . The Celtics surrounded him , and they all slapped each other 's buttocks and nodded and walked around with each other . I thought , ah , but I shall regret the poor chil dren . My father said , " Well , Our Lady of the Charitable Mysteries and Reliquary Book Sale , if it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for books , on account of both depend on spring , which has to do with the pagan notion of the earth reborn , and the Christian 's juvenility about his Lord . If the deer wo n't come down , being a medieval symbol , then the Christ is not arisen . And if He wo n't be bothered , then I surely do n't have to commemorate a spring that has n't come by can rying my private property down to Solsville and watch them give it away . " My mother said , " You never should have stayed away from the war . You were meant for it . " I turned Cousy off and went for my coat and boots . When they called me , I was ready . They were surprised . It was getting colder , and the air smelled wet , like snow coming . My father drove slowly and sighed , as if he were relaxing . The hack seat of the wagon was down , and I sat with my back against their seat , my legs on the floorboards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cartons of hooks . I listened to them breathe and thought about the father saying , " We are going into the forest to hew wood , and in the evening , when we are ready , we will come and fetch you . " Of course I was intelligent and enlightened , and according to my parents I lived in a climate of reinforcement  --  I no longer suspected that I was adopted ; I no longer thought I wholly would mind if I were  --  so all I had to do was lean back in the darkness of the car and the darkness of the ending day and watch , as we crossed Route 12 and drove up the rutted icy roads , past gray houses with dull yellow lights in the windows , past mobile homes with eighty-foot antennas , and see how too smoothly we slipped into the woods . In the summer there , you 'd mostly see the maples and ash and beech , what elms were left , and the evergreens filled the spaces in between . But in the early autumn , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . First the trees were n't bare , because they bloomed bird 's nests , vacant and ragged . Then the wind took some of the nests , or you stopped noticing them , and there was a lot of emptiness around . Then it was winter , and the evergreens seemed to step forward , the annual-bearers seemed to recede , and then what you saw was snow , the hard brown roads , the evergreens covered in white , and the scraggly wisps of deciduous trees waiting for spring so they could step back into full sight . It was a slow , exciting dance , and I miss it , but I wo n't go back to watch . m Y FATHER SMOKED HIS PIPE , the car filled with smoke , my mother sneezed , and he drove up steep roads , past all houses now , into darkness , the lights still off . The car shivered and slid on its heavy snow tires , but he pushed it up . My mother said , " I think we should go back , Hank . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always do this . We always come looking too early . " The tires whined , but he kept the car moving . I drew my knees up on the floorboards beside me and leaned over the seat , looking forward now , sniffing in the pipe smoke , letting an elbow touch each parent 's shoulder in the fragrance and darkness of our ride . I saw the branching-off of our snowy road ; in the darkness , the snow seemed to glow with a light from underneath it , and then the secret light went out as my father turned the car lights on , and we were coasting downhill slightly , but pretty fast , at a fork . I would have stopped . My mother said it very clearly , that she thought we ought to . He let the car slide left , and we went downhill farther , maybe fifty or sixty yards , the car slid hard , then stopped  --  as if cement had just that moment turned from fresh to ten years old around the wheels . " Okay , " my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No , " my father said . He floored it in forward gear , then shifted to reverse , floored it again , then shifted forward , then into reverse , and the wheels whined , the motor roared , a cloud of snow and exhaust blew up behind us , and the car stayed where it was . " Maybe not , " he said . The heater was on full , and it was getting sweaty in there , and the smoke from his pipe seemed suddenly a little sweet . I thought of sweets , of poisoned pancakes , and I said , " Hey , dad , are we really trapped here ? Can we get home ? " My mother said " Shh " but it was too late . My father , who was tall and heavy , and whose hair was an unkind color , like a metal you might find in a factory or hospital but never around the house , shouted , " Well , of course we 're going to get home ! For Christ 's sake ! Do I really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course , dammit . And we 'll get home in the goddamned car is how we 'll do it . " I did n't answer , and he said . " Right ? " " What , daddy ? " " I said right ? " " About what , daddy ? " " Jesus ! " he said . He slammed the door closed when he got out and walked through snow that looked sometimes to be up to his calves and sometimes knees as he went toopen the tailgate , pull out the folding army-surplus shovel , and bend behind the steady red shine of our taillights to stoop and push , rise and heave  --  I can see that now , at any time , in a crowd or in my sleep , that steady red-tinted rise and fall of my father in the forest , hewing . My mother held onto the forearm of my heavy jacket , but I moved away . I watched . The shovel flashed red as it crossed in front of the light , and so did his hands , and so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was chopping us out , and once he looked in. panting , blowing , the sweat on his face a bloody wash in the taillights ' falsifying glow  --  he would have loved to see himself like that , and perhaps he was looking at his reflection in the glass  --  and he smiled at me , and asked forgiveness with his grin , as he usually did . But then he got angry again , frustrated , and his head bobbed up and down again , his face was hidden , as he dug at all the snow in the Brookfield forest . After a while my mother said , " I hope he does n't have a heart attack . " I said , " Can I dig ? Can I take a turn ? That 'll keep him from having a heart attack . " My mother said , " He is so determined to have a heart attack , neither one of us can do a thing to keep him from having his way . Your father 's a baby . " I said  --  and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was only talk ; and yet maybe it was my memory of the woodcutter 's wife  --  I said , " Should you be saying things like that about your husband ? " My mother squealed . Her head retreated , like a turtle 's . She opened her mouth wide , and I saw her tongue quivering . The door boomed and my father hurled himself in behind the wheel , panting , heaving against his clothes . She closed her mouth . I said , " Do n't have a heart attack , daddy . " " Absolutely not , " he said . He rocked the car forward , then from forward to reverse , reverse to forward . But we did n't move . The metal of the motor screamed , and he stopped . He said . " One more shot at it . " I thought of the family who did n't have enough to go around . I thought of wandering among the thick , self-reliant trunks of trees which went so far up . I could n't see their tops . Making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own tongue . My mouth freezing open . yes , the tongue iced to the roof of the icy mouth . I thought of the snow turning black . the tree trunks white , my body going from white to black . My black tongue frozen in my mouth , my black teeth biting at nothing . Black wind pouring in and out . Everything black down past my tonsils to my stomach and my bowels . Then I saw my eyes , and they were black marbles . I thought of people knowing that I was there forever and not mourning . But regretting it . My father , leaning over the seat , interrupted me by saying , " Give me the books . " " What ? " " The goddamned books , goddammit ! " 4 My mother said , " Do n't take it out on him , he 's frightened enough . " " I 'm not frightened , " I said . " I 'm not taking it out , " my father said . He stopped moving , then started again , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought what was higher was lighter as well . He reached in past my arms and legs and hauled things into the glow of the glove-compartment light : " A soupcon of Thomas Hardy , I think . Ah , just right : Jude the Obscure , famous family man . Never did get his degree , as I recall . Yes . And some Dickens ! Come on , Chuck , let 's have the old Bleak House there and  --  oh , my land , how generous , he 's giving us A Tale of Two Cities too . Now that 's what I call giving  --  somebody needs books , you give books . Am I right ? And Miss Bronte , I believe ? So kind of you to hurl yourself into the effort . " He chuckled like what a mad scientist is supposed to sound like , and I guess that was meant to reassure us . I passed a few more over to him , and he took them and went around to kneel behind the rear wheels . We heard him grunting even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ W /THOUT ASKING PERMISSION , I got out . I took the flashlight with me , but I kept it off . I stood with the whole world behind me , and because the road sloped , maybe , it felt as if everything could tip upon us , pour down onto us and sweep us farther along the road . Everything was black and white , the snow was glowing again since he 'd turned the car lights out , and the all-but-darkness of the a forest seemed to make the snow burn brighter from within . It felt as if the world below the forest floor were hollow , and warm , and bright with the laughter of comfortable adults . My mother looked through her window at me . She smiled a kind of smile , and I did it back . My father had finished wedging the paperbacks underneath the tires  --  his last hope for traction and then he got in to put the car in gear and floor it . I stayed where I was , my hands cupped over my ears so tightly that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Or perhaps it was because I was bellowing with the motor in its effort . Jude and his babies and Ellen and Sydney Carton and Catherine Earnshaw and Heathcliff flew from beneath our wheels , were torn by the deep treads into tiny fragments and blown behind us and up into the air . They sailed there , half in darkness , then down into the brightness of the glowing snow , and then they were carried by the wind and were ridden away . They were gone by the time my mother and father , ponderous in their snow gear , came out . Bulky as they were , they were as prone to flight and disappearance as the tiny papers and their black invisible words . A couple of chunks of the stronger covers lay in odd designs behind the wheels . I was looking at what was left , and thinking of the family where hunger was foremost , and where there simply was n't enough to go around . My father , I saw at last , was looking at me . He was grinning . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We go looking for deer , " my mother said , " delicate gentle little hungry deer , and look what we end up with . A dead car and " ? pointing at my father , at the woods ? " this . " I said , " You really messed up , daddy . You got us lost in the woods and everything . " He shrugged , then turned to shut the motor , lock the car up . I watched him as he walked around the car , being certain . I said , " I guess we did n't get that messed up . " He came back and stood before me . He said , " You think I screwed things up for you ? " I was shivering by then . 1 turned the flashlight on and pointed it at his face . There was no body and there were no woods . There was my father 's face , and the darkness . He looked into me the way some people peer into rooms . He saw what I was seeing . Looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then into me again , he said , " Do I look Iike a ghost to you ? Are you really good and scared ? " I started to cry . I let go of all of it and cried very hard . " I 'll get you home , love , " he whispered down onto the top of my head as he hugged me . " I 'll get you out of the woods and I 'll get you into your house and before you know it , you 'll be laughing . I can do that for you , love . " I felt my mother move in to hug us . She pulled at the flashlight and I let it go . I kept my eyes closed and felt the dark woods tilt upon us , then hold in actual place . My father  --  who was not a woodcutter , and for whom the hungers did not consistently come first  --  said , " It 's all right . I 'm not a ghost . There are n't any ghosts .
