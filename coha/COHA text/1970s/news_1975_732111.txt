txt Letters to the Editor Letters to the Editor Energy : On the Need for Decontrol To the Editor : We continue to hear and read of United States Senators and Representatives and state officials of the Northeast and Southeast and even the Midwest who are so shortsighted that they believe a political solution of controls in energy will solve our problems . Already this attitude has resulted in closing down much planned exploration for new sources which would free us from OPEC embargo dangers . The attitude of people here in the Southwest who have used their lands , expended their effors and used their capital to provide energy for the rest of the country toward these Eastern fantasies is much like the attitude of the average taxpayer toward the ablebodied welfare recipients who will not help themselves . For instance , Great Britain has more proven offshore oil and gas reserves in the North Sea than all of the offshore oil and gas reserves for the entire United States . This can only mean that some parts of the country are not trying to help themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ controls starting in 1954 , The Fed vs. the City To the Editor : Federal Reserve Chairman Arthur Burns has determined that finances of the nation 's largest city are not as important as the nation 's largest transportation company ( Penn Central ) or a medium-sized bank that was a member of the Federal Reserve ( Franklin National Bank ) . The Federal Reserve will not ( 1 ) provide funds by buying city or Big Mac bonds ; ( 2 ) pressure private banks to purchase such securities or guarantee the city against default or ( 3 ) open the Federal discount window at this time unless bank liquidity is threatened . These inactions are contrary to what the Federal Reserve undertook for Penn Central and Franklin National Bank ( estimated cost to Federal Reserve of latter alone : approximately $1.8 billion ) . In refusing to aid New York City , the Federal Reserve may be again committing a phenomenal blunder similar to its contraction of the money supply in the early thirties , a primary cause of the deepening of the Depression , the massive 1969-1970 credit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heights . ? Actions of the Federal Reserve , as well as the state and Federal Governments , with respect to New York City have , besides requiring curtailments of vital services , raised the taxes of all U.S. ' taxpayers ( interest rates for all municipal and state financings have gone up ) . If , in addition to , needed reforms , some of the City 's social services were paid for by the Federal and To the Editor : Because we have initiated a d  --  tente with Russia and China ( far off in different hemispheres ) , many people think it is logical to do the same with Cuba . No matter what coloration is put on it , the fact remains Communism has established a base ninety miles from our shores , from which it has been organizing against the United States throughout Latin America . At the time of the missile crisis it was agreed upon between Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev and President John F. Kennedy that the United States would not invade Cuba and that the United States would be permitted to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . hidden missiles . The Inspection was to be under the auspices of the United Nations . Not only has there been no " on-site " inspection but since then the Russians have established a naval base in Cienfuegos in Las Villas Province , where missile-bearing submarines obviously may be harbored . The following points need clarifica-tion : What is . Castro going to do regarding the release of the political prisoners who have been in jail since Batista fled Cuba on Jan. 1 , 1959 ? Have we forgotten the Cuban patriots who have been in jail since April 1961 , when they were captured . during the Bay of Pigs invasion ? The invasion force , under complete American control , was known as Brigade 2506 and was composed of 1,443 men . They were trained and equipped by specialists of the United States Army . which assured artificially cheap fuel by controlling price , particularly natural gas , and thereby discouraging exploration for and development of new oil and gas resources as well as discouraging the development and use of other energy sources . One obvious answer to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been to decontrol prices . Only by allowing the free market processes to work can we make it plausible to develop the other sources of energy , such as solar , nuclear and shale oil , as well as to stimulate the exploration for new sources of oil and gas here at home for the shorter-term energy solutions . No longer can people who drive cars , or heat buildings , or consume energy otherwise , expect to get it for less than it costs to replace it . If your politicians tell you differently , they are not just mistaken , they are telling you falsehoods . GILBERT C.

( The current Federal budget is out of balance by almost $100 billion . ) Moreover , the Federal Reserve has the power to print more money , an alternative not available to municipalities . It is a sad day for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard-nosed attitude toward America 's largest city . ALAN R. SLOATE New York , Sept. 4 , 1975 ? Savings Plans To the Editor : Whatever happened to the idea of saving New York City a significant amount of money by having the city income tax collected and paid along with the state return ? Now that the state is more deeply involved in city finances it should be possible to effect this obvious economy , which should also make life easier for the paperengulfed taxpayer . Another money-saving idea that seems to have been forgotten is to pressure the Federal Government to provide for the costly extra protection for the multitudinous foreign consulates and missions in New York City . Given the lack of Federal assistance in the present financial crisis , it seems appropriate to create a situation wherein the Federal Government would be forced to fill the vacuum that would be created by removal of this extra protection . GERALD ADI.ER Scarsdale , N. Y. , Sept. 5 , 1975 What will be the fate of our naval base at Guantanamo Bay , which protects the Panama Canal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Government of Cuba . Are we going to Ignore claims for approximately $2 billion of American assets illegally expropriated when Fidel Castro took over the Government of Cuba ? We have short memories . Today , rapprochement is being discussed . The trade embargo which the United States imposed upon Cuba will soon terminate . Cuba needs our spare parts for all its equipment ; understandably , American manufacturers want to take advantage of the available market . Yet there is so very much to be resolved before the United States considers the resumption of diplomatic relations with Cuba while it is being governed by a ruthless Communist dictator who hates the United States and has abolished all personal freedom and human rights . EARL E. T. SMITH Palm Beach , Fla. , Aug. 29 , 1975 The writer was United States Ambassador to Havana from 1957 to 1959 . The Times welcomes letters from readers . Letters for publication must include the writer 's name , address and telephone number . Because of the large volume of mail received , we regret that we are unable to acknowledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Editor : While it appears that New Yorkers have become resigned to the new 50-cent fare , city politicos can be assured that in most cases the increase in travel costs stings . And even- as we quietly accept the 50-cent fare , let it be duly noted that the fare increase in not a fair increase to the many New Yorkers in two-fare areas , paying $2 a day to get to and from work . For example , thousands of Coney Islanders pay an extra dollar a day to go to and from the trains on a bus . ride that is a little over a mile , at . most . The bus route Is from Stillweil Avenue to West 37ti ? Street , all within Coney Island . To Coney Islanders ? , most of whom are in the low- or lowmiddle-income brackets , the extra fare is indeed unfair . If the Transit Authority can not see fit to delete the charge for such transportation to the trains , it certainly . can include these relatively short rides in its " Add a Ride " program @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ program applies only to changing from one bus to another : It permits a person to pay full cash fare upon entry into ? one regular bus and obtain ' a ticket which , with only 25 cents , will allow entry into another regular bus at the " first point of intersection with any local route . " In the case of Coney Island , the " first point of intersection " is the= train-bus terminal at Stillwell Avenue ; ' which many years ago , during the : nickel trolley days , did have an " Add a Ride " feature . Giving " Add a Ride " - to this and other such areas is a matter which can and should receive : prompt action . GEORGE L. SIEL ' Brooklyn , Sept. 2 , 1975 ' ? To the Editor : I would like to suggest a painless solution to the transit fare problem ; . ? Let the savings institutions ( which are actually competing with the department stores ) give to those estab-. lishing new accounts tokens instead of appliances . ? The department stores @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " in which varying amounts of free tokens could be given with the purchase of certain items . ? Food stores could give . away . tokens instead of stamps or free tokens with orders of ' a certain size . ? The large food companies could offer free tokens instead of cash In , their discount coupons , which are , printed by the millions . ? As a fringe benefit , employers could either give free tokens to their employes or offer them at a substantial discount . An additional benefit of this plan.ls that the distribution of large numbers of tokens is free and would result . in considerable saving to the city . DANIEL J. EGAN . Newfoundland , N.J. , Aug. 28 , 1975 ? To the Editor Now that the 50-cent fare has be-f come a reality in the City of New , York , immediate steps should be taken to pass a transportation tax to lower , the fares below the pre-existing 35 : cent fare , which was too high at that . In our inflationary times , it is ' a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economically pinched people living and working in the city will be further burdened by the increase in the cost of traveling when common sense calls for a reduction in this area of life . New York should ' follow the lead of other cities which ' have recognized that their economic health depends upon the public being able to travel at economic rates . In addition , consideration must be given by our State Legislature without delay to the subject of the increased ' commuter fares . Too many commuters . ' working in New York find the latest increase intolerable . HARRIS L. PRESENT New York , Sept. 2 , 1975 ? To Care for the Children To the Editor : Representative Biaggi 's charge that 77 voluntary child-care agencies have reaped millions of dollars of profits ' by holding children in institutions and ' foster homes rather than seeking adoptive homes for them reveals gross ignorance of New York City 's child-care. system . The voluntary agencies serving New . York City provide the highest-quality , care in the nation , financed through a purchase-of-service system which results in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the public : agency . This is possible because the philanthropic community of New York - . City representing the three sectarian federations ? Catholic , Jewish and Protestant ? supplements public payments for these services with charitable contributions . Our own agency has served severely , emotionally disturbed , mentally ill and delinquent adolescents for six decades . Ninety-nine per cent of these children have their own parents , who have placed them for treatment and do not wish to ( nor should they ) surrender their children for adoption . Of the small number of children without families , most are not adoptable because their age and Severe disturbances make , them poor candidates for adoption would place an unfair burden upon the , adopting couple , . Mr. Biaggi ( night well do a great , : deal more investigating before leveling such charges against agencies which have rehabilitated thousands of children who might have otherwise driftedinto careers of crime or lived their ' lives in mental hospitals .
