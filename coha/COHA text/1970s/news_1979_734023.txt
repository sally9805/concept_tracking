txt The famous , the powerful and people who were just friends , 2,200 of them , honored Nelson A. Rockefeller yesterday at a memorial service that lauded his faith and his efforts for the nation ? and ended with an upbeat jazz recessional celebrating his buoyancy and optimism . President Carter , Vice President Mondale and Chief Justice Warren E. Burger flew in from Washington . Former President Gerald R. Ford and Secretary General Kurt Waldheim of the United Nations led national and international dignitaries in Riverside Church , an edifice bait largely through the philanthropy of Mr. Rockefeller 's father . Four times elected Governor of New York and for two years the nation 's Vice President , a man who inherited millions and viewed public service as a responsibility , Mr. Rockefeller died suddenly of a heart attack at the age of 70 on Jan. 26 . Former Secretary of StaZe Henry A. Kissinger , , solemn and slow-spoken , apparently trying to control his emotions , - Excerpts from eulogies are on page 23. - recalled the first admonition he got from Mr. Rockefeller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " Tell me what is right . " He also related a remonstrance . When he told President John F. Kennedy what was wrong with a particular policy , Mr. Rockefeller chided : " Your duty is to offer solutions . " It was a family occasion as well , in which Mr. Rockefeller 's daughter , Ann Roberts , remembered that he had filled his children 's lives with excitement and " challenged us to reach beyond our grasp . " " As we leave this church today , " Mrs. Roberts said , " he would want us to get on with it , to go forward , to take our lives in our hands fully and joyfully as he did . " His oldest son , Rodman , also speaking from the pulpit , said , " I thank God that the world is a better place because Nelson Rockefeller passed by . " Mr. Rockefeller 's brother , David , chairman of tte CY.ase Manhattan Bank , said " this is a day of mourning , but also a day of thanks " for leadership and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disappointment as well as success . " The 75-minute tribute ended with Lionel Hampton at his vibraphone , accOmpanied by his jazz group , sending the contregants away with what was often the finale of Nelson Rockefeller campaign meetings , the zesty melody of " Sweet Georgia Brown . " Among those present were 80 members of the Rockefeller clan . His wife , Margaretta , known as Happy , at times looked desolate , eyes downcast , and President Carter , next to her , whispered support . But she was strong again during a later reception for 250 people , embracing many of them and saying , " Thank you very much for your friendship . " Mr. Rockefeller 's first wife , the former Mary Todhunter Clark , entered a secondrow pew with her son Steven , an associate professor of religion at Middlebury College , in Vermont . She seemed to fight back a tear when Mrs. Roberts spoke of the early days . In the first row were Lady Bird Johnson , wife of the late President , and Secretary of State Cyrus R. Vance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York 's Senators , Jacob K. Javits and Daniel Patrick Moynihan . There were more than 100 members of the Senate and House , including Senator Barry Goldwater , who won the Republican Presidential nomination over Mr. Rockefeller in 1964 . And there were diplomats and other representatives from more than 70 countries , including Britain 's Foreign Secretary , David Owen . But there were also those without national renown . Agnes Roosa grew up in Pocantico Hills , the Rockefeller estate in Westchester County . where her late husband was a building painter for 50 years . She remembered playing baseball with the boy Nelson there long ago . Clarence Roberts was Pocantico houseman for more than 20 years . Now retired , he came down from the Berkshires . Robert Pet field was a tree surgeon for nearly 40 years , and Raymond Wylock was superintendent of maintenance . Both are now retired . And there were 27 designated ushers , a virtual inner circle for Mr. Rockefeller beyond his family . How He Would Have Enobled Us ' " Much has been said or written about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Mr. Kissinger told those present . " This misunderstands the man . His failure to reach the Presidency was in my view a tragedy for the country . What a great President he would have been . How he ' would have enobled us . What an extraordinary combination of strength and humanity , decisiveness and vision . " " Yet I never heard him express even one word of disappointment , " Mr. Kissinger continued . " As with everything , he sought the office with zest . But when it eluded him , he went on to new challenges , undaunted , resilient , inexhaustible . " " Destiny willed it that he made his enduring mark on our society in a way that transcends personality , " Mr. Kissinger said , " almost anonymously in the programs he designed , the values he upheld and the men and women whose lives he changed . " The former Secretary of State added : " But if he were here he would tell us : Do not look back , do not be afraid or ashamed of your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not a burden , but God 's blessing conferring an opportunity to oppose tyranny , to defend the free , to lift up the poor , to give hope to the disadvantaged and to walk truly in the paths of justice and compassion . " The Rev. Martin Luther King Sr. , father of the assassinated Nobel Peace Prize winner , delivered a prayer . His son 's widow , Coretta Scott King , sat in a front pew with Muriel Humphrey , wife of the late Vice President Hubert H. Humphrey . President and Mrs. Carter flew into and out of Kennedy International Airport for the tribute . The security arrangements included New York City police officers stationed for blocks around , even in lobbies of nearby apartment houses . A Fire Department pumper was hooked up to a hydrant , and a ladder truck and pulmonary unit stood by . A fierce , cold wind whipped outside the church . Bracing against it , Andrew Young , United States representative to the United Nations , declared that " as a Democrat , I was always a secret admirer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had " made a major contribution to establishment of a black leadership . " Inside , the church staff , led by the Rev. William Sloane Coffin Jr. , set about resuming regular programs ? one of them a nationwide campaign to " Reverse the Arms Race . "
