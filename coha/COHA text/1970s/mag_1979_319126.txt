Kissinger <P> To the Editors : <P> At last we have in Henry Kissinger 's White House Years Oct. 1 a political memoir of world events for the lay person . The excerpt , void of political jargon , punctuated by imagery and vivid characterizations of political figures , moves along like a well-written novel . I only wish my college history textbooks were written in this fashion . Who says that past political events have to be flat and dry ? <P> John Brown <P> Willingboro , N.J. <P> Bravo for the wealth of insights in Mr. Kissinger 's excerpts . Perhaps I am a typical American who " tends to see international relations in terms of the play of individual personalities , " but I wish that Mr. Kissinger would write some of the same type of clear and precise in-depth reviews of world leaders and geopolitical situations on some sort of regular basis . <P> James W.

Who 's on the cover of this week 's edition ? <P> Don Klein <P> Vero Beach , Fla . <P> The pale colors in the portrait of Kissinger on the cover make him look pallid and sickly . You probably chose it thinking the glum look appropriate to the gravity of his memoirs . <P> On the other hand , the photograph inside is a beauty . The colors are strong and vibrant , just like the man . He looks you straight in the eye and holds your interest . There is a quiet confidence and a seriousness softened by a touch of sadness in his expression . It would have made a great cover . <P> Masako Y.

Talbott spends all his time telling us which despots we should back and which we should discard , according to our best interests . When a tyrant is no longer useful to us , we should invoke human rights . Only in the last two lines of his Essay does Talbott remember that the people in the distressed countries should have something to say about their own destiny . <P> Philip Angeles <P> Pensacola , Fla . <P> Contrary to Kissinger 's pragmatic approach , I think the current Administration 's consideration of human rights as a foreign policy is a growing force . Our degree of support for a particular government depends more and more upon its consideration of human rights rather than the type of government . <P> Bob Isaac <P> Lakeport , Calif . <P> It is not the collapse of the Somoza and Pahlavi regimes but their establishment with more than just a little help from official U.S. clandestine departments that should shame us . <P> Tord Friiso Denver            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
