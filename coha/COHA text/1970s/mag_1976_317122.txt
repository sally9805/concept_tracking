Day after day , the Democratic presidential hopefuls crisscrossed the frozen cornland by auto , plane and camper . In sub-zero weather , they grasped outstretched hands at street corners and factory gates . They flooded the mails with thousands of pieces of literature and they saturated the air waves with radio and TV spots . The prize hardly seemed worth the effort : Iowa would send a mere 47 delegates to the national convention out of a total of 3,008 . But as the curtain raiser on the nominating process , the Iowa precinct caucuses stood to give one candidate a publicity bonanza and a jump on his rivals . <P> That is largely what happened . Of some 45,000 Democrats who turned out to vote at the precincts , the biggest bloc went to " uncommitted " - and one party professional wondered : " Is this a vote for Hubert H. Undecided ? " Except for that , Iowa proved a significant victory for former Georgia Governor Jimmy Carter ( see story page 17 ) . He won 27.6% of the vote , or the potential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indiana 's Senator Birch Bayh , won 13.1% . <P> Carter , 51 , campaigned longest and hardest of all the candidates . By last September , his organization was set up , and it was steadily reinforced by volunteers , including out-of-state supporters and the candidate 's two sons , Chip , 25 , and Jack , 28 . Above all , Carter knew how to appeal to the Iowa voter . He presented himself as a plain-spoken peanut farmer and small businessman who wanted to go to Washington to set things straight . " He understood Iowa , " says state Democratic Party Chairman Tom Whitney . " It 's a rural state where word of mouth is still the foremost way to communicate . What someone says in Dubuque will be repeated three days later in Council Bluffs . " Ever smiling , Jimmy gave his home phone number in Plains , Ga. , to folks who asked for it . If he happened to be home when they called , it would be he who answered the phone-not a secretary or an aide . <P> No Comfort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inflammatory issue . The Iowa Catholic Conference sent out a newsletter suggesting that Carter would support a constitutional amendment against abortion . In fact , Carter is on the record as having opposed such an amendment , but he managed to fudge the issue by saying he would favor a " national statute " limiting abortion . His ambiguous position won him the support of Right-to-Lifers at many precinct meetings . In heavily Catholic Carroll County , he overwhelmed Roman Catholic Sargent Shriver by 47% to 3% . <P> The other candidates could not take much comfort from Iowa . Bayh 's labor support was not as strong as it might have been because Carter cut into it . A large segment of the United Auto Workers in Iowa backed Jimmy . Bayh also waited too long to start organizing and campaigning . " Our problem was too little too late , " said Bayh 's Iowa campaign manager , Dick Sykes . <P> With 9.9% of the vote , former Oklahoma Senator Fred Harris did about as well as expected , though he professed to be elated . " Iowa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we 've been winnowed in . " His vote suggested that he enjoys a hard-core support on the left that will stick with him as long as he is in the race .
