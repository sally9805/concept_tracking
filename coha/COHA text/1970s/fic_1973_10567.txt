You wo n't touch me , will you , Morgan ? " " If you know who I am and still did that , you 're a fool , " Morgan says . I turn to Poslosky . " That 's it for today , Lieutenant , I think . I 'll get back to you about the golliwogg once the bank releases his dough . They can go back . All but Morgan . I 'll go Morgan 's bail . We 'll work something out so it 's processed immediately .

That 's exuberance talking , the flush of freedom . The guy 's got terrific community ties . Roots like beets . Bring him along , then . " This is a violation of procedure and Poslosky visibly balks . Morgan 's guard stands up against his man like a Siamese twin . Sotto voce I say to Poslosky : " Ontday ooyay ohnay oohay oovyay otgay ? " " Oohay ? " I whisper into his ear and remind him of the message Lou said he had for me . I offer a few Phoenician flourishes . Poslosky looks over at Morgan who by this time is almost cuddling his guard . " Well , if he 's such a big shot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's he so reluctant to leave ? " I take him aside . " Poslosky , you have an inquiring mind . I like that in a policeman . All we know for sure is that City Hall wants him the hell out of this place .

Look , I do n't know any more about it than you . I heard something was up and I 'm just putting two and two together from the message Lou tried to pass me . I bet Lou tells us we 're to zip down with the guy in a paddy wagon to Judge Ehrlinger 's chambers , arrange a quick pro forma bond and get him the hell off our backs before his suit dries . They give it a twelve-minute investigation and charges are dropped this afternoon . If he 's held a minute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your shoes . " " All right , we 'll see what Lou has to say . " Poslosky tells the guard to hold on to the prisoner and we step outside to speak to Lou . Word-for-word , I swear to you . My people have n't been in this business thousands of years for nothing ! Morgan , the wagon , Ehrlinger  --  Ehrlinger , a hack , is special-duty magistrate this week  --  everything . Poslosky is electrified . He gets on Lou 's phone and arranges for a wagon and a couple of guards to be waiting when we come out with the prisoner . Inside five minutes we 're on our way . I sit up front with the driver . Poslosky himself helps me into the wagon and closes the door for me . He shakes my hand through the open window . " Thanks , Phoenician . " I lean out .

Gee , kid , I could stick around here talking philosophywith you all day , but we better get that mother downtown before Ehrlinger wets himself . " " Yeah . So long , Phoenician . "  |p46At  the courthouse Morgan walks between me and the cop to Ehrlinger 's chambers . I study him closely but ca n't tell how much his anger is antagonism to me or appreciation of his situation .

" A judge 's chambers , even Ehrlinger 's , give me a hard-on of the spirit . All that oak paneling  --  brown is your color of civilization  --  darkas bark , those long earthen fillets of wood like a room made out of cellos , the faint oily odor of care ( I remember the smell ) , the deep brass fittings like metals in museums , the lovely heavy leathers adumbrating strap , blood sports  --  geez , it 's terrific . The desk big as a piano , and the deep , clean ashtrays on its wide top . And the souvenirs . These guys have been officers in wars , served on commissions . Their official surfaces trail a spoor of the public history : a President 's pen ammunitions a marble bore , Nuremberg memorabilia , a political cartoonist 's original caricature framed on the desk in love 's egotistic inversion , the flier 's short snorter aspicked in paperweight ; toys , some pal industrialist'sminiature prototype @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obscure prints on the walls , deft hunts and European capitals in old centuries , downtown London before the fire , Berlin 's Inns of Court . A fat globe of the world rises like an immensesoft-boiled egg in an eggcup , girdled by a wide wooden orbit that catwalks its equatorial waist . Red calf spines of lawbooksglow behind glass . Only the flag distracts  --  an absurd bouquet drooping from a queer umbrella stand on three claw feet with metallic , undifferentiated toes . The judge 's black robe is snagged on a hatrack . Ehrlinger is at his desk pretending to write an opinion when the clerk admits us . The man has been a district judge for years , will never rise higher , but he is absolutely incorruptible , so inflexiblethat he is never more dangerous than now when , sitting in his capacity as the week 's special-duty magistrate  --  who hearsp47in camera special pleadings that violate the court calendar  --  he is asked to alter the conventions . Like many humorless men , Ehrlinger loves to be entertained . I play the fool for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " He looks toward us annoyed and glances at Morgan 's papers that the clerk has just placed on his desk . " Ca n't this wait ? This man 's just been arrested . The police can hold him for twenty-four hours . Why could n't he have his bail hearing tomorrowwith everyone else ? " " Influence , " I break in quickly . " You know these crooks , Your Honor . They have friends in low places . " " Oh , it 's you , Phoenician , is it ? " " Yes , Your Honor . " " Well , let 's get on with it , then . " " Wait just a moment , Your Honor . There 's something I 've always wanted to do , sir . " " What ? What 's that ? " " No , no do n't pay any attention to me , sir . Just go on writing that precedent-making opinion . " " Here , what 's all this about then ? " I rush to the hatrack where Ehrlinger 's robe is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and lean in under it , manipulating my right arm free of the robe and holding it up . Still bent down and hidden in the garment I pivot toward the judge . " Hold it . " I clench my exposed hand into a fist . " There ! Got your picture , Your Honor ! " I creep back out of the robe and stand up beaming . " Oh , Phoenician , " Ehrlinger says . " Tarnation , sir , a man your age . All right , now , all right , " he says like Ted Mack on The Amateur Hour , " that will do . Let 's see what we 've got here . " He turns back to the file and I wink at Morgan . Ehrlinger studies the file for a moment and looks back up . " Well , " he says , " according to this there have been no previous arrests . Is that right ? " " Yes , sir . " Morgan says . Ehrlinger grins . " Punched him , did you ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fetched him a good one ? " " I guess so , Your Honor . "  | " Well , strictly speaking , you 're supposed to keep your hands to yourself , and since these students had a permit for their rally it was quite proper for the police to bind you over . " " What 's this ? " I ask . " Still  --  " Ehrlinger says . " When I heard him urging those kids to burn their draft cards  --  " " Could n't control yourself . " " No , sir . " " Wait a minute . " " Well , when I was your age I 'd like to think I 'd have done the same . " " Hold on . " " He was a pimply , long-haired freak . To tell you the truth , Your Honor , it was more like slugging a girl . " " Well , you ca n't say he did n't have it coming . " " I 'm even kind of ashamed . " " Jesus ! " " Broke his jaw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sir . " " Under the circumstances it would be hypocritical of me to congratulate you , Mr. Morgan , and the law 's the law . There were a lot of witnesses at that rally . I 'm afraid you 'll have to appear . " " I know that , Your Honor . " " Still , I 'll try not to make it too hard on you . We 'll set a fifty-dollar bond . " " Thank you , Your Honor . I did n't anticipate any of this , so I do n't happen to have that much cash on me . " " I understand . " " Fifty dollars ? Fifty ? " " I 'm glad you brought him by , Phoenician . You showed good judgment . There 's no sense in a man like this having to spend even an extra minute in jail . " " He broke his jaw ! " I shout . " Yes , " the judge says . I turn to Morgan . " He was making a speech ? " " Yeah , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " A rabble-rouser ? " " Until I clipped him . " " Judge , this man broke a boy 's jaw . No matter what you or I may think of the young man 's politics , it 's perfectly apparent that the kid was a student leader , a public speaker . Who can tell what disastrous effect Morgan 's punch might have on that young fellow 's future platform performances ? Suppose he meant to go into radio ? Or be a singer ? To let Mr. Morgan off on a pledge of just fifty dollars  --  why it 's . . . it 's condoning , it 's tantamountto a dereliction of duty . " " Always having me on , Phoenician , " Ehrlinger says blandly . " That 's humor , so it 's all right , but blatantly to try to up the ante at a patriot 's expense just to line your pockets with a few paltry dollars , that 's something else . No . To be perfectly frank , Phoenician , I know as well as you do that the bail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my little joke on you . " It 's useless . " Sure . That 's a good one , Your Honor . " " Just turn your documents over to the clerk on the way out . Your appearance is in three weeks , Mr. Morgan . Will that be all right ? " " Yes , Your Honor . Thank you . " Outside I take out my checkbook . " Wait a minute , " Morgan says , " what are you doing ? " " Writing a check . " " Hold on , " he says uncomfortably , " money does n't change hands unless I fail to appear . " " Yes , that 's right . Sign here , please . By my penciled x . " He 's glaring at me now , but he signs the forms and I give them to the clerk together with the check . We step into the elevator together . " Your fee 's what ? Ten percent ? Here 's your five bucks . " He holds the bill out stiffly to me but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carefully . " What is it , the suit ? It do n't cost five bucks to clean a suit . Give me two-fifty change .

" " What do you mean it 's been taken care of ? "  | " It 's been taken care of . There 's a gentleman waiting for you outside . A professional golfer I think he said . " Morgan 's face drains . " What for ? " he asks hoarsely . " How should I know ? Maybe he needs you to fill out a four-some . " " You son of a bitch , " he screams , " you sold me out ! " " That 's right . I pick up a cool twelve fifty on the deal . " " Cocksucker !

How the hell could I know all the cops wanted you for was for smacking some goddamn hippie ? Painstaking attention to detail , we try harder . Bygones are bygones . The favor is I warned you . " " The guy 's outside , you said . What am I supposed to do ? " " It 's a courthouse here . Confess a crime . Expose yourself to a meter maid . Up to you . I 'm getting out on three . You 're not .

If you should happen to get away from that palooka , just remember your appearanceis in three weeks . I 've got fifty bucks tied up in you . If you do n't show up , I 'll come get you . " I release the door , it closes behind me and we 're quits . The bailbondsmen of Cincinnati , Ohio , eat their lunch across the Ohio River in what is now an enormous restaurant a mile southp51of Covington , Kentucky . Called The Grace and Favor , its name sounds like an English pub , but it bears no resemblance to one . Built in the early twenties , it has had several avatars : speak-easy , night club , gambling casino ; briefly a dance hall during the bigbandera and then a roadhouse when that style went out after the war ; a night club again in the fifties until the public had learned by heart on television the songs and routines of the stars who appeared there , then a sort of caterer 's hall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sprang for the enormous weddings of their daughters ; a place where the Republican Party sponsored $1,000-a-plate dinners and the Democrats $25- and $50-a-ticket closed-circuit viewings of rallies staged in Hollywood and New York , with a cash bar available  --  until , in the midsixties , it finally became a restaurant , though it had always had a kitchen , food being a necessary concomitant of such places , prepared to serve at a moment 's notice the high roller 's steak and the gunman 's lobster . Probably because of its various incarnations , The Grace and Favor enjoyed a certain geisha ambiguity : no matter what its function at any given moment , there were always people around who remembered when it had had another ; who saw a dance floor where the tables and banquettes now stood , or remembered the crap tables and chemin de fer and roulette where the dance floor used to be ; who could still see the queer metallic aisles and pews formed by the rows of slot machines ; who could conjure up through the altered walls and windows and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ordinary sea level of the surrounding room ) prior configurations , where coppers ' bullets , shattering mirrors , might have brought seven years bad luck had not the management seen to it that no such continuity was likely in the place 's chameleon transitions . But no one , save the emigre English gangster who built it and who was now an old man , had witnessed all of it , though some , even some here at the long table reserved for the bondsmen , had been there at the beginning . There had been lacunae . They 'd had to leave town , perhaps , or been called to war , or suffered strokes ; one thing or another had taken them away at a time when the establishment was undergoing one of its many transformations . Now , in per/haps its most effete phase , as a restaurant for Cincinnati businessmenand clubwomen , it did its biggest business at lunch . ( It was genuinely immense . Its main room alone could handle 500 diners without giving the appearance of crowding them . ) The new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spanned the Ohio River and actually provided it ( since advertisingis banned along federal highways ) with its own broad grassgreenreflecting sign ( " Grace and Favor %Z Mi. " ) and exit ramp ( no one , not even the most cynical of the bondsmen , knew how this had been finagled , though the speculation was that perhaps one of those $i , 000-a-plate dinners had made it possible ) made it as accessible as any restaurant in Cincinnati . The bondsmen came in taxis , five or six to a cab , and rubbed their loud , heavily padded , sports-jacketed shoulders  --  they dressed in a sort of mid-fifties style , like customers in delicatessens on Sunday mornings  --  with the furred shoulders of the clubwomenand sober-suited buyers from the downtown stores . The London broil for $1.50 was a specialty . It was what they all ate , the distinction in their appetites if not their characters apparent only in the way they wanted it prepared and what they chose to gulp it down with . The Phoenician was not with them today , and since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of the bondsmen were disappointed that he was not there to take their ragging . None made any comment , however . This was not their usual social gathering . It was a new departure , more or less a formal business meeting , scheduled weeks ago . They had never had a business meeting and were a little uncertain how to begin . In the trade all their adult lives , these were men who had never tired of the infinite eccentricity that came their way , who by the simple process of constant witness had become expert raconteurs , sheer access to " material " democratizing any differences in imagination and delivery that might once have existed between them . They looked around the table at each other , their glance finally settling on Lester Adams , a tall , speckled , taciturn bondsmanin his seventies . Adams had got into bailbonds in the thirties when his farm was taken from him by the banks . He had come to Cincinnati top53look for work and found $loo in the street on his first day in the big city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his small village of Bend , Ohio , had no jail , though it had a J.P . who functioned also as a law enforcement officer and Lost and Found service ) to return it , carrying it openly in his hand because he had never seen such traffic before and was a little afraid he might be run over by a truck and the money found concealed on his person and people would wonder what a simple , destitute farmer like himself was doing with a hundred dollars cash in his pockets . He was looking for the Lost and Found , which was , he reasoned by analogy , in the immense courthouse . He waved the bill in front of him as he came down the corridors , snapping it like a flag of safe passage , the ostentation of the gesture only slightly less painfulto him than his fear that people might think he came by it wrongfully , until he was stopped by a lawyer who was looking for a bondsman to put up $75 bail for his client . The lawyer , who had seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his attention . " Bondsman , " the lawyer said , and Adams , thinking the man had said " Bendsman " and that it was a question , immediately answered " Yes . " The lawyer explained his client 's circumstances and Adams , who had n't followed a word of what the man was saying but who was chagrined not to have recognized a fellow townsman , thought : In the big city not a whole day and whole night and so shook that I not only do n't remember this feller though we come from the same village but do n't even recognize that he looks familiar to me , and nodded in agreement to everything the lawyer said , figuring out only as the lawyer went on and it was too late , and that it was his own pleasant nodding that had made it too late , that his old friend seemed to want to borrow seventy-five dollars of the farmer 's found hundred to help out a friend of his own  --  possibly , Adams imagined , another fellow Bendsman . When the lawyer 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm in worse trouble than I thought , for this feller do n't look no more familiar to me than the first . Not in the big city a whole day and whole night and already I ca n't remember nobody . Spoiled , he thought , cursing himself , spoiled rotten , bigger headed ' n a sow 's belly . So he was already prepared to turn over the hundred dollarsp54to the lawyer and the twenty-five dollars change to the Lost and Found as soon as he could get away from him and find it when the lawyer said , " What about the form ? " Adams shook his head sadly . " Ai n't got no farm . Lost the farm . " " Never mind , " the lawyer said , " I 'll be right back . " He was as good as his word . In a few moments he was back with a piece of paper . " This 'll do , " he said . " I got it from the clerk . Here . Sign . " And though Adams could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right  --  was n't that how he 'd lost the farm in the first place ?  --  and he imagined that this was something to do with the loan , it not seeming at all strange to him that in the big city , where everything else was turned around , it was the lender who should fix his name to an IOU rather than the borrower . Then he saw that it was going to be all right when the lawyer 's client signed too . " When do I give the seventy-five dollars ? " he asked . " What ? " said the lawyer . " Do n't worry , he is n't going anywhere . Hey , " said the lawyer , " Baxter , pay the man . " And Baxter , the lawyer 's friend and fellow townsman , handed Lester Adams $7.50 for which Lester did n't even thank him , so concernedwas he that not only could he not place the lawyer and the lawyer 's friend , but could n't even remember Baxter now that he knew his name . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lawyer left the building and Adams was standing there with one hundred and seven dollars and fifty cents . He was so confused by now that he could n't move , and others approached him  --  all asking , it seemed , to borrow money . Under no obligation to these new borrowers since none claimed kinship with him , he was still too goodnaturedand too timid to have to tell them that he himself had no money and so he refused no one , and when he left the courthouse that day he had not only the hundred found dollars but eightyfouradditional dollars that the new borrowers had pressed on him ! Now Lester Adams was no dope . He knew a good thing when he saw one , and though he did not understand what had happened he understood that there had been a misunderstanding . Whenp55the corridors finally cleared , he approached one of the policemen and told him the story from the beginning and asked him if he could make anything out of it . The policeman could n't stop laughing for fifteen minutes , but when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ careful to omit nothing , not the most trivial detail , since the cop felt that only the truth , the whole truth and nothing but the truth , could drive home to the farmer what an outrageous hick he was , and this , meant as cruelty , was the best lesson anyone could ever have had about the ins and outs of bailbondery . " I 'll be damned , " Adams said to all the policeman had told him , " I 'll be goddamned . That 's some business ! Why , I 'll bet you dollars to doughnuts that in a wicked city like Cincinnati there 's always some feller or other in trouble . " With some of his one hundred eighty-four dollars he hired a private tutor , and inside two months he had not only improved his reading skills but could read and understand the most complicated legal documents , and inside three he was licensed by the State of Ohio to set himself up in the bailbond business , and by the fourth he had already had to go out after Baxter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and bring him back by force to the courthouse to stand trial as best he could on one leg . In the years since he had killed eleven men , was no longer a hick and could tell stories of depravitythat curled hair . Taciturn still , yet his imagination so greased by daily contact with the surreal that over the years his character had seemed to turn itself inside out as you would reverse trousers to sew their seams , it was Lester Adams who opened the conference . " They 're killing us , gentlemen . The social scientists and New Left coalitions and civil libertarians . The Supreme Court  --  and do n't kid yourselves , the Burger Court not only is not all that different from the Warren Court but in certain respects is even more dangerous , because where the Warren guys merely built up the rights of the indigent , this so-called conservative crew is inventing rights for the fat cats . Anybody here who would n't rather go bail for the president of GM than Pete the Tramp ? All that 's happened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legacyp56these strict constructionists are going to wall up our assholes . History is stubborn ; once its mind is made up it 's made up . Compassionis an historical inevitability and we have no better chance of bringing back laissez-faire than we do public whippings . " So they 're killing us . The 1966 Federal Bail Reform Act which gave federal courts the discretion to act as their own bondsmen and accept a ten-percent bond up front has already put us out of kidnapping , skyjackings and political assassinations . It 's put us out of bank stickups where the robbers have crossed state lines . It 's pushed us off antitrust , and it 's going to take the big antipollution cases that are coming up right out of our fuckingmouths . Crime , gentlemen , is increasingly political . It 's thrown us out of the more apocalyptic riots and raised the bridge on espionage  --  which admittedly has never been big for us  --  and it has the potential to squeeze us out of narcotics , to say nothing of the new pattern of conspiracy prosecutions which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Funds , this could have been the most lucrative fiddle of all . " Mark my words . As crime turns increasingly against the state and the people get the wind up , all that 's going to be left for us poor bastards are the petty thieves , wife beaters and dog poisoners . The chicken stealers  --  that 's our meat . Vagrants . Shit , colleagues , even abortion 's legal today . Five and dime , gentlemen , penny ante times , a metier of small potatoes like a little Ireland . In fact , there 's some doubt in my mind that even this will be permitted us . As heart wins the battle of history and bail commissionsthroughout the length and breadth of the land each day secure releases for good risks , ' we 're going to be left with only the two- and three-time losers .

There 's the dentin of a wild pig , dark as root beer , the pulp chambers in cross section like the white veins in liver . He sees the enormous tooth of a rhinoceros , taking the card 's word for it . It does not even resemble a tooth ; it is deep , chambered as a lock . In another case there is a comb of kangaroo jaw , four teeth blooming from the bone like cactus . He moves along a ledge of the extinct , peers at the camel-like jaw of the Macrauchenia Patachonica : " a member , " says the card , " of the peculiar South American ungulate orders . This genus wasp60camel-like but others were horse-like . Thus the litopterns show parallelism with the more familiar true camels and horses . " The keyboard of teeth float in the petrified gum like tulip bulbs . And the lower jaw of a ground sloth , relative of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bone , all shapes , one a figure eight worn down to the ground , another like a tree stump , a third like a pipe , a fourth with a crown the texture of target cork . The teeth are in terrible disrepair . ( They died this way , Alexander thinks , biting their pain . ) A root thicker than the wire in a coat hanger rises a full inch above the awful terraces of decay which surround it . There are teeth long and thick and curved as tusks  --  these were inside a mouth , Main thinks  --  huge as jai alai bats . As always , Alexander ignores the skeletons , the carefully wrought xylophonic carcasses , immense scaffoldings of spine , he supposes , from a hundred animals , so that what he sees is some ancient committee of beast he finds it difficult to believe in ( though he is fascinated by the individual parts : the shield-like pelvis , the separate vertebrae , long as the hilts of swords , a hinged jaw like the underedge of a key ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its odd squat like some plantigrade , prehistoric crap . No . It is the teeth . The tiny spines in the skull of a young jaguar , curiously white , sharp as toenail . Skin still adheres to the palate , the concentric tracery distinct and fine as what he touches with his tongue at the roof of his own mouth . It is teeth that he comes back again and again to see , as if these were the distillate of the animal 's soul , the cutting , biting edge of its passion and life . He is thinking in geological time now , in thousands of millions of years  --  thinking Pre-Cambrian , Cambrian , Ordovician , Silurian , Devonian , Carboniferous , Permian , Triassic , Jurassic , Cretaceous , saddened at the sixty-million-year-old threshold of his own immediate past , Paleocene , Eocene , Oligocene , Miocene , Pliocene , Quaternary . From seaweeds , younger only than the earth 's crust , through invertebrate animals , fishes , land plants , amphibians , reptiles , mammals , birds and men . He is weeping . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sir ? "  | " What ? Oh . Yeah , " the Phoenician says , " I 'm a sentimental old fool . " He starts past the guard , his friend . " I was wondering something , " the guard says . " What 's that ? " " Well , it 's just that you spend so much time here . " " Yeah , well , " he tells the keeper , " I 'll tell you why that is . I 'm a dentist . " He was late for lunch . ( As so often on museum days , his sense of time  --  he is an early riser , beats others to appointments , brisk as a candidate when it is time for the next , goes late to bed , paper work in the toilet , on the bus home , carrying no brief case but all pockets stuffed with correspondence , pens , notepaper , stamps ready in his wallet  --  turned tragic , pulling long faces , the past slowing his blood , thickening it , stopping his watch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to the office . The bus stop he 'd chosen , looking back over his shoulder as he walked from one the two blocks to the next , was outside a drugstore . A woman waited with a shopping bag . " Missus , " Alexander said , " have you been waiting long ? " " About ten minutes . " " Just miss a bus ? " " It was pulling away when I came out of Kroger 's . " If he hurried he would have just enough time to call Crainpool . " Crainpool ? " " Yes , sir . " " What 's up ? " " It 's been very quiet . " " No messages ? " " The man who was in earlier stopped by . " " What ? The mobster ? " " He said Mr. Morgan gave him the slip . He holds you respon-sible . " " Does he , now ? Has there been an afternoon mail ? " " Yes , sir . " " Well ? "  | " There was nothing from Chile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Germany ? " " No word from East Germany . " The Phoenician cracks down the receiver so hard that the drugstore clerk looks up at him . Loose , he thinks , fugitives at large  --  the phrase , as always , chilling , raising goosebumps . He thinks of swamps , caves , passes in mountains . Loose . At large . He thinks of settlements so inland in terrains so forbidding that the inhabitants have no language . The chatter of apes , perhaps , the signals of birds . As always , the idea of such remoteness abstractshis face , neutralizes his features , a sort of paralysis of the attention . People watching him wish to help . " Is there something you wanted , sir ? " the clerk asks . At large , loose . " Hmn ? " " Is there anything I can get you ? " Loose . " What have you got that 's binding ? " He sees his bus outside and rushes to board it . They are in Hilgemann 's Restaurant at the girl 's request . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to dine outsidein the beer garden . Though it 's warm enough , the long bare vines snaking among the trellis make him nervous . He could never have been a farmer ; he is a bailbondsman because he can exercise some control over his crops of criminals , his staggered harvests so nearly continuous that he feels he does not deal in time at all . ( His calendars are only a sort of map , like the precinctmaps in police stations . ) So they are inside , in an Ohio approximation of Bavaria , leashed to reality by the sealed blue hemispheres of Diners Club , American Express 's bland centurion and Master Charge 's interlocking gold and orange circles decaled on the window like bright postage . He sees airy clubs , spades and hearts between the spindles of the heavy , low-backed captain'schairs , notices the sweet intrusion of a stuffed deer 's head  --  no teeth there  --  and the elaborate plaster-of-Paris mugs that hang from their handles above the bar and that gravity arrangesp63in identical angles , a fringe of falling men , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tiny hookah or an early , complicatedsteam engine . Once Herr Hilgemann offered to present the Phoenician with his own , and to have his name inscribed on it . " I 'm not a joiner , " he told him . He sees without appetite the heavy portions of thick , stringy meats  --  flank and chuck and pot roasts , and sanded schnitzels , worms of anchovy curled on them like springs . Thick gravies wound the table linen . There are constructsof pastry , geometric lattices of chocolate , baked bridges of caramel , fretworks of crust , flake , cherries in cross section like the intimate slivers of biopsy . Among these moist ruins Main chews the sandwich he can not taste ; he does not want the fearfulcutlery in his mouth , those heavy tines . He is amazed at the girl 's appetite . The lunch , as Miss Krementzmight have guessed , is unnecessary ; this could have been handled in the office , or on the phone . He might have asked her , as he had asked others , to write a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jump Bail . " He does n't even feel like explaining it to her . He feels like taking a nap , like dreaming of fugitives , for though they are his nightmares , at least in his dreams he is with them , learning their plans , seeing them in their new settings and fresh disguises . " All right , " he says , and puts down his sandwich . By the time he is ready to speak he has already decided against her boyfriend . " Arson 's one of the highest bonds there is . It 's a very high bond . You set fire to a building  --  " " But he did n't . " Alexander shrugs . " You set fire to a building you bring the insurance companies into it . They 're the ones who determine the prices ; not me . I admit it is n't fair . Every sort of minority pressure group exists in this country , but who gives a second thought to the arsonist ? Fire Power ! I 'm just thinking out loud . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that there 's too great a presumption of guilt if he stays in before the trial . " " That 's true . " " Well , what do you say ? Have you made up your mind ? " " I have to give you a test . "  | " A test . " " It 's routine . " " What do I have to do ? Hey , wait a minute , I 'm not looking for a part in your picture . Do n't get any funny ideas . " " What , the crap you eat ? You 'd blow me out of bed . " " Okay , I just wanted that understood . I 'll give you a cashier'scheck . We 'll go to the bank and have it drawn up . " " You have to pass the test . " " I have to pass the test . " " It 's a very stupid test . " " All right . Let 's get it over with . " " It 's not scientific . It is n't for an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Actually it 's an insult to your intelligence . " " Try me , for God 's sake . " " How much do you love Mr. Hunsicker ? " " What ? " " How much do you love him ? Do you love him a bunch ? " " Certainly . Of course I do . " " A whole bunch ? " " Yes . What is this ? " " Oodles and oodles ? " " This is crazy . " " Do you ? " " Yes . " " Show me with your hands . " " With my hands ? " " Just spread them out real wide and show me . " She opens her arms . She might be a fisherman demonstrating the length of a large bass . " That 's all ? " " No . More . Much more . " " Show me . " She opens her arms so wide Alexander can hear her shoulder blades crack . Her tits come forward into her food . " That 's not so much , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There is n't any test . " " I ca n't do it . He 's a marked man . Your boyfriend 's ruined . You should n't think badly of him . Innocent men are sometimes lousier risks than guilty . How do I know if he sets fires ? I like the prosecution 's case , but that does n't mean anything ; they could still lose . The thing is , in your boyfriend 's state of mind he does n't think they will . I saw him . He 's very depressed that this has happened to him . I do n't think he 'll go the course . Too much money is involved ; it 's too big a risk . " " Why did you put me through all this ? " " You got a good lunch , what are you kicking ? What did the other bondsmen 's food taste like ? You want dessert ? " " I want to get out of here . " " I 'll get the check in a minute . No , you were thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on you . I ask you , what chance would a person like myself have with a girl like you ? " " None . Thanks for the lovely lunch . See you . " " Yeah . My wife is dead , did you know that ? " " I 'm sorry to hear that . That 's like , you know , tough shit . " " Right . That 's just what I told her when we learned she was dying . " " You really are one dreadful son of a bitch . " " No . What are you saying ? What do you know about it ? You want dessert ? How about some of that creamy shit with the nuts ? " " You actually think you can get me to go to bed with you . " " One lunch ? You set some value on yourself . I never remarried . " She makes no move to leave . Perhaps she thinks he will still do a deal with her . " I play the field , go with the whores now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some lulus . Do anything for money , some of those girls . Now if one of my whores died , I 'd put money in the jukebox and sit at the bar with my hat on my head like Walter Winchell . " " You must have loved her very much , your wife , " Miss Krementz says levelly . " Yes , well , she was very ordinary , very plain . We married each other in our middle years . You know what I could n't standp66about being married ? The picnics . All those trips to the damn beach . With the blankets and the towels and the sandwiches in wax paper . Warm Coca-Cola . Wearing swim trunks . Being barefooton the pebbles , or the sand in my shoes if I kept them on . It was n't any better in the backyard . Stretched out in Bermudason the folding lawn furniture . I come from a desert people , a hot culture , sand in my blood like lymph , but it 's as if I was running a temperature the whole time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a job on me with the oily rags . Sweat on my belly like the fat on soup . My jockstrap was grimy , it gave me a rash . Sundays . We were together four years but all I remember are the fucking Sundays . Lounging around . Trying to figure out things to do , bored at the barbecue and settled at the fence like a lost ball . " Not only Bermudas  --  pajamas . Do you know how much I hated pajamas by the time it was over ? I like pajamas , I always did . Who wants to lie with his great red balls over the place , with his cock drifting like a weather vane or the needle on a compass ? No , I 'm a pajama guy . In motels , hotels , I love a pair of pajamas . But they have to be starched , they have to be fresh . I like a crease in them like the morning paper . But when my wife was living I wore them for a week , a guy who never slept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handkerchiefs and smelly as socks . " I do n't know , a year is supposed to have four seasons . I only recall the heat waves , being uncomfortable , doing stuff I never wanted to do , that she never wanted to do . Nobody could want to do that crap . People need to be comfortable , but you get two people together and all of a sudden there 's got to be plans , activities , you bust your ass figuring new ways to get stuck in the traffic . Her leukemia went my bail . Now I jerk off or go to the whores , specialists like the one man in Boston who can do this terrific operation . Or I give myself a treat and get one of those pricey call girls from the university . The ordinary is out forever . " I see guys like me in restaurants  --  like the two of us here  --  old goats with tall blond bimbos with bangs on their foreheads like a cornice and terrific tans . You wonder , father and daughter ? Uncle and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ townp67with the nerve actually to ask bellboys where the action is . Why am I telling you all this ? " " Why are you telling me all this ? What makes you think I 'm interested in your life ? " " You 're not ? Do n't you want to know how people live ? What 's the matter with you ? What are you , twenty-five years old ? How much can a kid like you have seen ? You got a fever too ? Did Mr. Hunsicker shove wadded newspaper up your ass and spritz it with charcoal lighter ? All right , we 'll skip the love life . This is how I feel on this fine spring day : like I could only recover with drugs the sense of my possibilities . Like I 've never been to the laundry in my life . You eat like a horse and I 'm full . This is the reason I asked you to lunch and turned down your buddy 's bond . To lay this on you . Now you know some of how I feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this much about me . There 's more , but I 'll spare you . Say , you got any pictures of yourself ? You 're a beautiful girl . I 'd like to have your snapshot . I 'll give you four dollars for it . " " You 're crazy . " " The hell I am . Crazy people are excited . You think I 'm excited ? Then I ca n't have been making myself clear . Listen , I 'll tell you something . If we had this conversation yesterday I might have made the bond . Maybe not , maybe yes . Something came up . I crossed a scary man today . I was slipshod . My altiloquentstyle takes too much energy . I 'm the best in the business , but I 'm seven thousand years old and slowing down . Also I missed an important meeting with my colleagues . They 're planningways to beat history , natural selection , doing in progress over a suggestion box and London broil in Covington , Kentucky . They think I 'm against them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . London broil ! Those damn fools . They 're chewing extinctionand do n't know it . London broil . A half-hour ride all the way to Kentucky and they eat London broil . And you know why ? You want a sign of the fucking times ? Because Kentucky fried chicken ai n't been on the menu for years ! " He took out his wallet , put seven dollars on the plate beside the bill and stood up . " What sign are you ? Do they still ask that ? What sign are you ? "  | " Me ? Sagittarius . " " Sagittarius , yeah ? " " What sign are you ? " " Pliocene . " The Phoenician put the girl in a taxi . He had the beginning of a hard-on . Stepping out of the bright cool sunshine , Alexander Main opens the door to his office , jiggling the gay sleigh bells above his door . " Get to work , Mr. Crainpool , " he calls out absently to the arm-gartered man . " Get to work , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ? If you 've finished what you were doing , find something else . We do n't pay out our good money ... ' ello , ' ello , " he says in his inspector 's voice . The mug from Chicago is sitting at his desk . " Who 's been sitting in my chair ? " the Phoenician asks dully . " Where 's Morgan ? What did you tell him ? " " Listen , type , you owe me money . The bail came to somethingunder the five thousand you mentioned . " " Where is he ? " " You want to know where he is ? " " That 's right . " " He got away from you ? " " You told him I was outside . " " Let me understand . He got away from you and we 're back at square one ? " " Yeah , right . " " Then I 'm still on the payroll ? " " Where is he ? " " I 'm still on the payroll ? " " You know where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can produce him . " " Let 's see . The bond came to fifty bucks . Thirty percent for fingering him is another fifteen . That makes it sixty-five dollars I 'm owed . " The gangster takes out his wallet and lays two twenties , two tens and a five down on his blotter.  | " Very well . " He takes the bond agreement from his pocket and shows it to him . " Yes . Municipal court . Room nine . His appearance is in three weeks . " " You 're something else , brother . " He shoves one of the tens back in his pocket . " Welsher ! " Main shouts . " Do you see , Crainpool , how this soldier contrives to worm out of our agreement ? Indian giver ! " " Oh , you 're really something else , " he says . " You 're just lucky I 'm a professional and that no one 's paying me to do you . I do n't play benefits . But I 'm going to have long talks with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to make detailed reports about you , Mister . " His tone changes and he looks at Alexander with something like surprise . " Fifty bucks ? His bond was only fifty bucks ? Shit , do n't they know anything in this burg ? " " A backwater . " " Okay , bad information . We got this call he was busted and they sent me down . " " What the hell , a day in the country for you . " " Sure , right . " " An outing , a little fresh air . Come back and see us now you know the way . " " Right , " he says . " In three weeks . " He goes out . " Well , Mr. Crainpool , was that exciting enough for you ? " " I 've seen better . " " Yes . And you 'll see better yet . " " Will I ? " " Twenty-twenty , sir , close calls and closest . Now then , what have you got for me ? " Crainpool points to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yes . I 'll call on Avila , I think . " " You 're always the one who gets to go out , " he whines . " Yes , " I say , " that 's the thing about freedom . " Avila 's offices are downtown . He is not a criminal but a divorcelawyer , and his place of business reflects this . It is in with the good stores and better office buildings in that three- or fourblocksection of the city that is our Fifth Avenue.  |p70The  day is a reproach to my heart , as though , like all old men on a splendid day , I precede Nature , am there by sufferance , time 's professional courtesy . I have left my topcoat behind , but no matter . God sees through me , knows it 's only old Alexander Main down there in His high-rent Cincinnati , no boy , no boulevardier , only the sullied Phoenician with sin and history like shit in his gut . God sees through my bright caps , knows what 's beneath them , sees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my being , the cloudy tracings in which the teeth stand parallel as staves . And under the gums the cementum-sheathed roots hookingbone , seeking wild handhold and purchase like some apraxic mountaineer . God knows my jaws . Still , here I am . If nothing else my money entitles me . ( I have written my will . I am to be buried with my cash . It will line my coffin like salad , so that one day the archaeologists will find me , lightning will strike , the earth move , the state push through a thruway , the new ice age bulldoze me a thousand miles south , scientists of some distant time catalog me , my bones like leftoversin the wormy lettuce of my fortune , Alexander 's ragtime bond , gone surety for himself , in on bail . Perhaps , if they still exist , space will be found for me in the case of some future museum , the fingertips of schoolboys on my glass , smudging the watch face of my crystal isolation . ) Meanwhile I usurp pleasure from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spring breeze blowing through Cincinnati 's Lego boulevards , in our Lego America . Down the big street I go where the skin of one buildingmerges with the skin of the next in Siamese connection , a long Chinese wall of architecture , past an outdoor cafe with a little low white fence propped on the wide white street like a playpen that must be folded each night and taken in from the weather . Awning shows . As if Cincinnati were a port city , some sailcloth town . A waiter moves in and out among the tables , not in uniform but in a light gray suit , wearing an old boy 's tie beneath a vest crisscrossed with watch chain and trophied with the keys of elective societies . I gaze in at the clean store windows  --  there 's our century 's real art , in its window trimming  --  like sets for a perfected life . I enjoy other people 's good taste . Things are set off , isolated inp71high fashion 's splendid cages  --  a beautiful desk and beautiful chair off-center in an immense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across the arm of a superb Wassily chair , is a Braemar cashmere , pale green as the open spaces on dollar bills . A kiosk bristles with bright announcement  --  a Ukrainian dance troupe , Lipizzaner horses , the Black Theater of Prague , the Stones , the Black Watch  --  the posters projected on the tall cylinder like foreigncountries painted on a globe . I am surprised they are printed in English and not French . Even the air smells French  --  chestnuts , Gauloises and gasoline . Ahead of me a girl steers down the street with her hand deep inside the back of her boyfriend 's trousers , using his ass as a tiller . I pass another sidewalk cafe . An elegant woman sits beside a man who wears the whitest turtleneck I have ever seen . His cavalry twill trousers are custom-made , bespoke slacks . Elbows on the table , the two lean toward each other in intense affinity over their empty coffee cups . I look down to read the message in the crumbs of their brioches on the white cloth , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ workmen in ladder trucks lift Easter decorations into the thin trees , long strips of gold foil in light rigid frames , exactly the size and appearance of bedsprings . When I passed here two days ago they were up only to Pogue 's Department Store ; now they have gone another two blocks , inchingtheir way the long length of the avenue like a golden blight . I enter the new office block and refer to the huge directory that takes up almost the entire width of one black marble wall . I locate the number of Avila 's suite  --  I have never been here before  --  and tell the operator I want the eighteenth floor . He stops the car between floors , turns to me and takes a crude wooden box from his pocket . There is a sort of Hawaiian scene painted on it . He is going to show me a magic trick . " You smoke ? " Without waiting for me to answer , he lifts the lid and demonstrates that the box is empty ; then he opens it again and there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have lost tobacco at both ends . He laughs . He has plastic hearing tubes in his ears like tiny drains . " Maybe I get you one of this . Three dollar . " " Say , do that one again . "  | " You smoke ? " He lifts the lid and the box is empty . He opens it again and there are the four stale cigarettes . " Three dollar . I get you one ? " " Nah , it 's a trick , " I tell him . Avila 's suite of rooms is as much a stage set as the store windows . Behind the facade of the steel and glass skyscraper the architect has contrived dormers , queer shapes to the rooms , here let in and there let out like a suit off the rack . I am eighteen stories above the street , but I could be on the second floor of someone 's two-story colonial in the suburbs . On the walls of the anteroom ( I have no appointment ; the secretary has asked me to wait ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as flags . The furniture here is not like office furniture at all . I recall the waiter 's good suit . It 's too much for me  --  spring , style , the future . The secretary says I may go in and I head down a corridor like a hallway of bedrooms . Avila greets me outside a door , a man in his mid-thirties , jacketless in black trousers and vest , long lengths of bright white shirt-sleeve dropping through its armholeslike acetylene . He shakes my hand and leads me by it into his office  --  how passive I have become  --  which looks as if it has been decorated by emptying three or four of those store windows . His desk is a drawerless slab of white marble five feet long and a yard deep on legs of Rhodesian chrome . At the wall to my right is an antique breakfront , old lawbooks behind golden grillwork like a priest crosshatched in a confessional . A cigarette lighter on his desk like a silver brick . A large round standlesslamp white as a shirt-front bubbles on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wool , has the appearance of bleached floorboard . An eighteenth-century French console table doubles itself against a mirror . Only the chair I sit on is invisible to me . Taste . Taste everywhere . A tasteful office in a city pickled in taste . Avila does not go behind his desk but takes a seat at the other end of the room in a chair upholstered in nubby handwovenlinen . He wears his clothes well . I see him sockless as a Kennedy in wet tennis shoes ; I imagine his rich man 's articulatedp73ankles . I see him on his low , wide bed , the giant strawberry print of his king-size sheets . I see him pluck parking tickets from the windshield of his sports car ; I see him hand them to his secretaryto pay . " Look , " he says , " I was n't expecting you . As a matter of fact , I was just going downstairs for a trim . " He has an actor 's indeterminatehaircut . " The barber 's right in the building . Why do n't you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the chair . " It 's out before I can think . " But it 's perfect . Nothing needs to be done to it . " " Oh , " he laughs , " appearance is nine-tenths of the law . I have a standing appointment with my barber every day at this time . A divorce lawyer depends a lot upon transference . Like a psy-chiatrist . " We are in the same elevator I have just come up in , but the man who showed me the trick is gone , sucked into history . It bothers me that I will never see him again . I do n't know how I know this . The barbershop is dazzling . Long slabs of yellow Formica jut out the length of one mirrored wall and the width of another like quick-lunch counters in a restaurant . It 's a beauty parlor here , bright as a plastic surgeon 's consulting room . Boxes of Kleenex , jewelers ' trays of combs , dop kits , big pink sponges , blue satin barber sheets , magnums of cologne , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mink and chinchilla , a definitive collection of Band-Aids , eyebrow pencils like the city desk at Women 's Wear Daily . There are laquers , shallow dishes of tint , a stand of Q-Tips upright in a clear box like a forest above the snowline . There are nests of wig , surgical adhesive , pots of mascara , blushers , eyelash curlers set on their sides and curving into each other like spoons in a service for eight . There are logjams of emery board , hot stringents and cold creams , fingernailclippers like tools in a surgery . Triple strands of fluorescenttube marquee the mirrors . I am excited here : I wish I could smell the lotions and shampoos and suddenly I lift a Max Factor pan stick and lick it with my tongue as if it were a kid 's push-up ice cream.  |p74Avila  sits amused and content in a barber chair and a woman in white slacks makes a few passes at him with her scissors and comb . As she steps back to appraise him , I accuse him of his handsomeness ; I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What ? No . I am very nondescript . " I see myself caromed off the mirrors , fractured in space like a break shot in pool . I see the checkered reflection of my checkeredjacket . It is expensive , even new , but it is gross . I have no taste , only hunger . I have never been fashionable , and it 's astonishingto me that so much has happened in the world . The changes I perceive leave me breathless . I am more astonished by what remains to happen . I have erratic , sudden premonitions of new packaging techniques  --  breakfast cereal in spray cans , insulatedboxes of frozen beer , egg yolk in squeezable tubes . Avila 's barber sheet could be a shroud . I ca n't stand looking at myself , so I pop into an empty chair at Avila 's side . A barber sets his newspaper aside . He approaches me . " Hair-cut ? " " Leave me be , " I say too loudly . " Can we talk here ? " I ask Avila . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Of course we can . ' Counselor , counselor , what a style you have ! Yes , I like it . Niggerizing the neighborhood , spilling confidencelike soup . " Going on the offensive shakes off a little of my passivity . " What a professional ethic you got there ! Can we talk ? ' Of course . What , is it a public library that we should lower our voices ? ' Right . Smell that fart ? I claim that . That came out of Alexander 's ragtime asshole , Main 's brown bellows . Why should I deny the obvious ? No two men 's farts smell alike in the entire universe . Like snowflakes and fingerprints . Learned counsel 's point is well taken . We can talk here . " " What are you on about ? " " Yes , well , we never did business till now , or you 'd know my thoroughness , my eye for detail , my fastidious methods . I take more pains than aspirin . Tomorrow is April first , lest we forget . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to appear in court . " I raise my voice so thatp75everyone in the shop can hear . " That 's Withers , the banker . EugeneWithers who could not make good on his alimony paymentsof twenty-five hundred dollars a month and who was thirty thousand dollars in arrears when our paths crossed in the courts . Eugene Withers , the president of Ohio First Federal SavingsBank , lest we forget . Incidentally , if any of you barbers , manicurists or shoeshine guys do business with him I would suggest a small run on his bank . Pass it on . Withers . " " What 's the matter with you ? " Avila says . " Where do you think you are ? " " He 's not in town . " " Well , he 's probably upstate on business . Why do n't you wait for me in my office ?

" They spoke of the breakdown of law and order , of crime in the streets , but what a discipline was in these streets , what a knuckling under and catering to the times . It is beyond his capacityto conjure up the future , he can not even imagine what the safety razors will look like twenty-years from now , or a snow shovel .

What can they be looking at ? Survivors for a lousy generation and a half ? In history already ? So soon ? He 's not young . He 's seen good times and bad , but never times like these , time itself doing in a season what once it had taken a decade to accomplish . Shall he get paint ? Send Crainpool to the window with a brush ? Have him paint in . . . what ? " Bail Out ? " " I Been Working on the Bailbond ? " " A Surety Thing ? " It 's as if he lives trapped in the neck of an hourglass . Style , he thinks . As a young man he wanted it , hoped that when he wakened it would be there like French in his mouth . Now he sees it as a symptom of a ruinous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pushes past the strollers and lovers and shoppers  --  it 's past three , the high school kids are out , the students from the university are  --  moving in the garishly dressed crowd like someone hurrying down an escalator . He brushes the arm of a young man in an ordinary white shirt with a master sergeant 's chevrons sewn to the sleeve . He dodges a girl in an ammunition belt , kids in flags , yarmulkes , the girls braless , their nipples erect , puckering their T-shirts as if they moved in perpetualexcitation , the genitals of the young men askew , crushed packages in their tight jeans , both sexes horny , literally , their sex antlered inside their binding clothes . He sees colors which till now have never been printed on cloth . He sees all the goodlookingyoung who seem some new species in their furred shoes , their boots , bags suspended from the shoulders of the young men , oddly courierizing them . The girls in pants , the ground rounds and roasts of their behinds , the lifting tension of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their trousers , like parachutists perhaps , sunk in them up to their hips and the small of their backs . There is something strangely military about this crowd . Perhaps it is the stripy patterns of their clothes , like the tricolors of decorations . The Phoenician yawns and a young man turns to him . " Hey uncle , I dig your sport coat . " " What , this ? " " No , it 's nice . "  | " You think this is nice ? You should see my doorman 's uni-form . " " You got a doorman 's uniform ? Wow . " " Yeah , well my daughter 's getting married Sunday and I 'm giving her away . " " Getting married ? No shit ? " He talks to him as if asleep .

" Cor blimey , Guv , where to ? " He does not want to return to the office , does not want to go home . " Take me , " he says , inspired , " to a swell hotel . " A doorman opens the cab for him and he steps out , pays the driver , goes through the revolving doors and checks in . He remembershe has no pajamas and asks the room clerk if there 's a men 's store in the hotel . He tells the salesman he takes a D. " Any particular style , sir ? " " Crisp . Linen . Crisp . " He pays for the pajamas and returns to the desk to pick up his key . " Luggage , sir ? " He holds up the new pajamas . The clerk hesitates . " What do you want ?

" What is it , you think I 'm a troublemaker , a suicide ? Furthest thing from my mind . Gim me my key . Gim me my key or I 'll get the manager . " The clerk extends the key and a bellboy steps forward . The Phoenician puts his hand in his pocket , takes out a dollar and gives it to the bellboy.  | " Save you a trip , " he says and , holding his new pajamas , moves off in the direction of the elevators . He loves a hotel room . This one is large , new . He is on the twenty-third floor . Through the wide clean Thermopane he can see the ball park , the clipped chemical grass , bright , glowing as emerald , green as eyeshade , has a perfect view into the stadium'sopen skull , the variously colored stands folded like nervoussystem along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jawbone , the buildings dental , gray as neglect , the Ohio juicing the town like saliva . It is a corner room and commands the south and west ; he can see Kentucky . He does not draw the drapes , bunched tight , coiled on a recessed track that runs along the ceiling above the windows , pleats on pleats in a loose reserve , a collapsed bellows of fabric . The blue drapes match the blue bedspread which looks as if it has never been used  --  looks new , as everything in this room does : the deep modern chairs , webbed as baseball gloves and with seats like the pockets in catchers ' mitts , the two-foot-high cherrywood strips set into two beige walls textured as taut canvas , the aluminum grill of the heating and air-conditioning unit flush with the top of the long window seat by the enormous western wall of glass . He admires the desk ( of the same smooth cherrywood ) that levitatesagainst a wall , its drawers suspended , hanging in air like holsters . He sits in the red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desk , opening a drawer , seeing with satisfaction the stack of thick white stationery , the golden logotypeof the letterhead , the two ballpoint pens , the yellow WesternUnion blanks . He clears the menu , textured and greasy as a playing card , from the surface of the desk , removes the tented cards that announce check-out time and give instructions about the operation of the TV , and places them in a drawer beside the treated shoe-polishing cloth and folded paper laundry bag with its tough kite string and green laundry ticket , a framed gum reinforcement hole at the top . He trails his fingers in the pile of brochures , shuffling them like a magician preparing a card trick . He closes the drawers which move back silently along theirp81grooves . On the right the smooth wooden desk  --  the wood in this room does not feel like wood , it is level as glass  --  becomes a chest of drawers , then a treaded slab on which to place suitcases . There are five lamps in the room : on the desk , on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table ; a chrome floorlamp with a tall narrow shade . The television swivels on a chrome stem before the southern window . He turns it on , and from his bed the figures on the screen seem to stand in the sky . He reaches over to the control panel  --  there is an electric clock , a radio , a speaker like a patch of brown canvas , rows of switches , buttons  --  and clicks it off . He walks into the bathroom , sees plastic jewel cases of soap , towels of different size and thicknesslike a complicated terry-cloth cutlery or a pantry of flag . He runs his hand along the rail angled like the trajectory of a banister above the tub , and touches the beautiful basin with its queer fittings . Like a dignitary cutting a ribbon , he tears the paperstrip that packages the toilet seat . He pees long and hard into the bowl , drilling his urine solidly into the faintly blue water . He loves a hotel room . I love a hotel room . This is in my blood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ancient heart . He returns to the bed and picks up the phone by the nightstand , first pulling out the tray at the base of the phone to study the information on the card there . He dials . " Room service ? Mr. Main in two-three-four-one . How late do you serve ? . . . Excellent . . . No , nothing now , thank you . I may get hungry around three this morning . " He dials a different number . " Is this the housekeeper ? . . . Housekeeper , if I should want some laundry done , could you ... What ? . . . Oh , I want the valet , do I ? " " Valet ? Have you same-day service ? . . . What about dry cleaning ? . . . Thank you very much , valet . " " Message desk ? Are there any messages for Mr. Main in twothree-four-one ? . . . Yes , dear , would you please ? . . . The red light ? Where might that be ? . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is n't flashing . I thought it might be broken . Could you test it , please ? ... Yes , there it goes now . What 's the message ? "  |p82And  the bar and the garage and the Avis desk . He makes inquiriesabout a baby sitter and calls the cashier and asks about cashing a check . He finds out , too , that he can leave his watch and valuables in the hotel safe . Then he dials nine-nine . " Who , " he asks , " is the house doctor ? . . . I see . Can you tell me anything about him ? . . . Well , like where did he intern ? . . . Could you find this information out and call me back ? Or leave a message with the message desk ? Or give me his room number and I 'll do it myself . . . Is n't that nice , we 're on the same floor . " He calls the doctor . The man has interned with the Sheraton chain . And one last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twothree-four-one . I want to leave a call for seven A.M. . . . Thank you . Goodnight to you , too , sweetheart . " It is not yet four in the afternoon . He did not ring up for theater tickets or dial the florist . He did n't call the hairdresser or ring 32 to request a Remington shaver or 64 to find out about an interpreter . He did n't put a call through to rail and air reservations or to the hall porter to inquire about kenneling his pet . He never rang the secretarial service . But he was reassured that these services and others were available , that he sat in his room linked , hooked up as a President to his needs , oddly loved , certainly trusted , his cash and checkbookand cards like letters of credit , to the world . He could have anything he wanted  --  carpenters to build him boxes , modelsfrom stores to show him new fashions , women , passport photographers , even locksmiths . He was totally self-contained , desert-islanded but not deserted , certainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than at home or at work or in the street . How silly of the hotel to call him its guest . His credit established he was something far more privileged and potent . In this mood he showered , not bothering to close the stall , careless of the water he deflected against the mirrors and walls , of the puddles he made on the tiled floor . Private , possessed by his privacy . In this mood rubs himself dry with the enormous bath towel and leaves it crumpled in a heap beneath the sink ,  |p83takes  one by one the pins from his new pajamas , their odor of freshness like the smell of health , their new resins like a pollen of haberdash . He draws the drapes , touching them , feeling their heavy , opaque lining , pulling them so tight that it might be a half-hour beyond dusk instead of barely four o'clock . He goes to the door to leave his shoes in the corridor for the porter to polish , already anticipating the morning when he will hook them in like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a corner , feels the cool bleached sheets , white as letterhead , the soft blanket . He sleeps . I sleep . He dreams . I dream . He smells the gold before he sees it , a vague , involuntary pinch of nostrils , some pepper reflex . He feels the gold before he sees it , coarse-grained as the friction strip on a matchbook . He tastes the gold , warm , faintly curried , greasy as magnets , drawing his tongue like a poultice , carbonating his saliva . He hears the gold , its hum of precious engined molecules , its rare hiss just beyond range . It must be all around him . Its heaviness thickens the air , himself , stranding his stance , sucking at his legs and feet like ground beside a precipice . He hears noises , hopes it is animals , knows it is men . No one has actually said anything . ( It is this silence which is so minatory . Animals , forgetting themselves , would chatter . ) He hears  --  what ? Exploration . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pressure of a shoulder against a wall , its resettling like elastic relaxing to its neutral length . Then taps , randomly scientific , reasoned , and shortly abandoned , a fury of the indiscriminate and something giving way , some rolled stone blossoming sesame ; the source of the sounds abruptly shift , ventriloquized , higher , further off . But he takes no comfort from this , for if the noises are now more different , they are morep84regular too , the scuffle gone out of them , and he hears . . . footsteps . And their proximity again adjusts . He knows where he is  --  in some payload of labyrinth , maze 's choice darkmeat like the eye of a hurricane  --  and that he is subterranean , in some architectonic cul-de-sac , an archipelago of walls and red-herringed ectopic space . He pictures the stone baffles and barricades , the inverted , earthen , conical screw of tunnel , wedges and bottlenecks and groins of space , all the false spurs , all the difficult dark . And through it all he hears them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of place as if they were walking along a map , taking no confidence when momentarilyhe thinks he hears them where he has heard them momentsbefore . Soon they are close enough for him to distinguish their tools , their levers and scrapers and mallets and spades , and to hear , too , in the aftermath of their progress , a queer dragged rustling . Then hears seals popping , stone scraped , wooden beams lifted and shoved back along grooves , some final hammering and the adjustment of stone tumblers in some huge lock . It is as if he hides in a hollow  --  the linchpin center , say , of a cube puzzle on a counter in a drugstore . He sees their light before he sees them , refracted , rolling off the walls like a sand dune , breaking like a wave , caught , confirmingas it comes the gold surfaces he had smelled , felt , tasted and heard before he had seen . He calls out , " Do n't hurt me . I 'm your bondsman . " They keep coming . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blazing oil one of them carries , they have brought torches , and these they now ignite , planting them in standards already there . The torches mitigate the gloom , but it is the contents of the chamber which dispel it , laserizing the light , unfurling it like flags in wind and flinging down impressionin a brilliant tattoo . " Can you see anything ? " one asks . " Yes , " says the other , " wonderful things . " Their first impression is aesthetic , then , the Phoenician thinks . He stands beside the tomb robbers , sharing their awe . It gives him a queer feeling . No criminal himself , this is the first time he has ever been tempted . He 's a little nauseous . Yet he isp85thrilled , privileged ; something stupendous is about to happen . This is what he sees : First the giant sarcophagus , the carniverous stone high as a man and long and wide as a car , a goddess in nude profile at each corner  --  Isis , Nepthys , Neith and Selkit  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost touching , death 's and state 's holy ring-a-rosy , an electric net of intersecting wings stretched like necklaces between them . Articulated tiers of carefully wrought scales and feathers hang from their armpits and along their outstretched arms , and bloom behind their breasts and cunts and asses like webs . Hieratic columns are etched behind these like sums in a foreign mathematics . The Phoenician squints but can not read them , can make out only water fowl and horse , owl and implement , musical instruments , boat and bowl and fish and wheat , and an incoherent zigzag of joined m 's like an illegible signature or a level lightning . He is furious with himself . This is how he has felt staring into museum cases . There is architecture on the walls , chemistry , astronomy . White Osiris sits on a throne in the air beneath a high hat like a bowling pin . Anubis , the black-headed jackal , stands behind him , resting a red , avuncular hand on his shoulder while birdfacedHorus looks on . Two of the gods trail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ points to a wall ; the other walks up to it and rubs his hand along a gilt bas-relief of two figures , a man and a woman , who sit in profile on a couch . The man clutches a sheath of arrows in his hand like a batter in a batter 's box , the woman a small fan of arrowheads . The tomb robber fondles the woman 's headdress . " Geez , " says this perfectly ordinary , human young man , no ghoul or monster but only one of the locals seen everywhere around Thebes and Karnak and Luxor these days , with none of the vandal 's malice or nonconformist 's zeal , out of work perhaps , for these are hard times , the slaves getting all the plum jobs , having the construction trades sewn up  --  and welcome to it , too , he thinks . The Phoenician notices something funny with one of the man 's hands . It 's clear he can be no apprentice to anp86artisan , and to judge from his sharp , cheap , city clothes there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's like it was knit right there on the wall or something . " " Come on , do n't stand there gawping or I 'll have your guts for garters . We 've got work to do , " says the first , an older man , the pro in the outfit , the Phoenician thinks , down from played out Giza or Saqqara probably , or Heliopolis , lured by rumors of these new untapped fields in the south  --  maybe an escaped slave 's drunken tale , confirmed by a primitive , illiterate map drawn by the slave himself , who may even have been killed for it , for this one looks a tough customer . Yet there 's something dedicated about him as well . Tough as he is , he was just as taken aback by that first sight of the tomb , his dry runs through the reamed ruins of Imhotep 's masterpiece or his posed tourist attitudes at the sites of the crumbling mastabas not having preparedhim for anything like this . No . All he 'd been truly prepared for ( treasure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plenty of treasure houses but had seen no treasure , or seen it only piecemeal , behind ropes in public rooms or flashing by quickly in a parade , or seen it only as a proposal , looking over a shoulder at the draftsman 's roughs and sketches on a drawing board ; real collective treasure , a Pharaoh'sfortune , being just something one has heard of in rumors , third- and fourth-hand accounts that lost detail and sank deeper into wild myth each time they passed from mouth to mouth , as geography is merely a concept to one who has never traveled ) were the architect 's mazes and torils and culs-de-sac , the dim blind alleys and traps and suckers ' avenues that led nowhere and kept him busy till the sun came up and the hired priests that guarded the tombs were flashed into wakefulness . Such impedimentshad turned him into the scout or hunter or Indian he was preparing himself to become by forcing him to discriminate between the real spoor and the counterfeit , testing himself in each of Lower Egypt 's violated pyramids , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party who rushed forward with the guide to view the now empty storerooms and holy chambers and chapels where the Pharaoh 's painted double stood in mimic lifep87in the picture-book rooms viewing his faded family album , fooled into feasting on images of food , hunting cartoon deer and fishing cartoon fish from cartoon rivers , copulating with cartoonsand waiting for the dead man 's soul to invade the ka 's body like a virus . ( And perhaps it could have happened , except that the tomb robbers always got there first , breaking the chain of expectation , spoiling eternity with the fierce needs of the present . ) Hanging back from the rest of his party to wander those useless funhouse corridors and minefield spaces , an illiteratewho has trained himself to read a stone 's insincerity , a musicianof structure with perfect pitch for the false note , who fell to this place like water guided by gravity or a magnetized needle ignoring every direction but north . " We 'll do the amphoras first , " the older tomb robber says . " The amphoras ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have you got the waterskins ? " The rustling I heard , thinks the Phoenician . " All right , give them here . Tip it . Careful , careful , you 're spilling it . " The Phoenician smells the precious perfumes , sees a glowing prism on the floor of the tomb , a puddle of spilled perfume reflecting light from the burning torches . It smells of the colors themselves , of red and yellow and blue and all the declensions of the spectrum , and is trampled by the first thief 's sandals so that it looks as if he is standing in a broken , burning nimbus . " Tip it back . I 'll get the other waterskin ready . " " Why mess with this stuff ? It 'll only weigh us down . Let 's just take what we came for and clear off . " " I 'm the one who decides what we came for . You 're just the bearer . What do you know about the traders in Rosetta and Avaris ? A Pharaoh 's unguents and liquors , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " This one 's heavy . It 's too heavy . " " Get your back into it . Shove , shove . Heave ho . " " It 's too heavy , I tell you . " " Here , hold the skin . I 'll try . Woof , you 're right ; it is heavy . All right , we 'll just have to go into it . Hand me the iron bar . Give me the mallet . I 'll tap this fucker like a maple tree . " Thep88older thief kneels and fixes the sharp end of the bar halfway down the length of the tall cask . " Move that standard over , " he snaps , " I ca n't see what the hell I 'm doing . " The second thief moves a candelabra of torches to within a yard of the kneeling tomb robber . Behind the sarcophagus a wall shines suddenly , and the Phoenician can see a panel decorated with the twelve sacred baboons of the night . They sit on their brown , swollen genitals as on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public toilets . Silver furred over their blue bodies and silver banged above their long doggy profiles , they contemplate symbols that look like the detached slides of slide trombones . There are black squares , brown , brown and black moons like slivers of overturned melon , silhouettes of thick cleavers , pairs of pillars in the same black and brown alternatives , a mysterious geometric alphabet , dark herons , one-legged chiaroscuro runners and odd wingless fowl that float in long vertical columns like figures in strange bankbooks . What 's going on here , the Phoenician wonders , for whom fine print and subordinate legal clause , loophole and condition and contractual exigency are as clear and straightforward as the exit signs on superhighways . Then he sees the fine translucent alabaster vessel with its gorgeous banded layers  --  teeth and checks and regiments of painted slaves , friezes of pumpkin and rows of something like nails in colors he has never seen and does not recognize but which remind him of vast latitudes of campaignribbon . It is here , just beneath the first buxom curve of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make the puncture . " Spread the lip on that skin wide as you can . Here , stand right here , we want to catch as much of this gism as we can . I 'll try to do the hole clean but the goddamn thing may shatter . Whatever happens do n't let the flame anywhere near this shit or we 'll go up like sunshine . " The Phoenician moves against a wall , his back , he imagines , grazing the strange painted symbols . He feels an odd warmth through the cloth of his shirt . Is it brown craftsmen in white kilts preparing funerary furniture , sawing wood , one man holding the piece steady while the other leans toward him awkwardly ,  |p89his  saw extended like the bow of a cello ? Long-eared Anubis in his jackal 's head bending over the mummy on its couch , touching the chest , making the embalmist 's final adjustments like someone straightening a pal 's tie ? Osiris , fastidious as a hostess , checking the offerings on the dead man 's table , the decoy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the house , their breasts bared , arms raised in a semaphore of grief , dust on their heads and in the limp springs of their hair ? His flesh takes their electric impression . " Get ready to catch the juice . It 'll come out like high tide . " He makes one deft , powerful stroke . The thick shaft goes in neat as a needle , but he was wrong to have worried about the flow . The amber liquid , whatever it is , is viscous , slow and thick as glue . It comes in measured plops , filling the chamber with a sweet sick smell , the odor of vital essence , a human butter lined with brine and the scraped , rendered slimes and marrows . A Pharoah 's liquors indeed , stuff of his godhead , ejaculatory final ethers . The Phoenician and the two tomb robbers reel and sway in a sort of instant drunkenness that sobers as it stuns . " Wow , " says the kid , " those Rosetta and Avaris traders must be cuckoo . Who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ giggles . " Collectors , man . Souvenir hounds . First editioners . That lot . " " One sip and you 're dead . " " They do n't drink it , fool ; it ai n't any aperitif . They put it in their cellars with the rest of the hard stuff . " He dips his finger into it and holds it under his nose for a second . " A very good dynasty . Yech . " He wipes his hand off on his clothes . " There , that 's enough , close the skin , plug it . I 've got to stuff something into this bunghole or the smell will put us out . " Closest to the source , the older tomb robber starts to gag . " Quick , get me a rag , a strip of that weave . Over there . On top of that chest in the treasury . Hurry up , will you ? " " That 's no rag . That 's cloth-of-gold . That 's priceless . " " I 'm puking my guts out and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 'll get it myself . " He gropes toward the chest , stumbles over a low couch , blunders momentarily againstp90the brake on a golden chariot which skitters across the floor and crashes into a wall . Recovering his balance he rips the cloth from the top of the chest , knocking a gilded alabaster statuette of the king to the stone floor and shattering it . " You got good moves , " the other tomb robber says . " Jesus . " " Forget it . Just plug that hole so we can get to work . " The young tomb robber shrugs , crumples the cloth and stuffs it into the amphora 's open wound . It protrudes from the hole , a golden run of gut . The Phoenician thinks of the gold weave soppingup the Pharaoh 's sublime jams and gravies , an inside-out alchemy that turns gold to dressing . But the smell is stanched and the air clears . What little lies uncollected on the floor is defused when the second tomb robber thinks to pour some of the perfume from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too much , did you ? " the older thief asks . " A couple drops . We can fill her up again from the first whatdoyoucallit , amphora . " " Okay . Go ahead , pour . Hold it , that 's got it . Good man . Here , set these skins in the antechamber where we can pick them up again when we leave . " They seem pleased to discover that they can cooperate . With a lift of his chin the second tomb robber indicates a gold life sign like a giant key ring that lies on a funerary chair . The older man nods , the kid scoops it up to place with the waterskins in the antechamber , and then both of them simultaneously rub their hands together . They are giddy with greed , high on their mutual visions of untapped plunder , their initial reserve and caution turned by their preliminary success . They know that they are already rich men . They move through the tomb expansively , magnanimous as high rollers . " The crowbars ? " the second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says the first . " No , not that . Use this . " He strides up to the sculpted , life-size double and wrenches the shepherd 's crook from where it rests like a riding crop on a ledge of hip and along a rail of upturned palm . " That 's class , " the second says . " Is it real gold , you think ? " " Thirty three thousand-karat . " They start the short stroll to the sarcophagus , but their initialp91jauntiness fades as they approach . They come up to it much as they might to a living Pharaoh , tentative , as if each . hides behind his own presence , concentrating , queerly chaste , made innocent by the magnitude of the violence they are about to do . They move silently toward opposite ends and silently raise their tools to the sealed lid . The older man seeks a purchase for the flat wedge of his crowbar , tilts at the seam experimentally , pumping in brief arcs as he would prime a tire jack . It slips out and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This ai n't no beer can . " " Let me try . " " No , hold on . I 'm not even budging it . You come on over to my side . Maybe if we both try . " The second thief stands behind the first , gets a grip on the long handle as if he were holding a rope in a tug of war . " When I give the signal , push in and up . " " Wait up , " the young one says , " I better wipe my hands first . They 're all slippery from that Pharaoh grease . Okay . What we really need is a block and tackle . " " We ai n't got any damn block and tackle . " " What 's this stuff ? " " I do n't know  --  yellow quartzite probably . You set ? Push .. . in and up . " " No good . It 's like trying to drive a spike with your bare hands . " " Get the mallet . " " Are you kidding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that thing with the mallet . Why do n't you give it a karate chop ? " " Shut up . Give me a minute to think . " The boy , satirically deferential , retires to a throne chair from which he first removes a small ivory casket . He puts it on the floor and props his feet on it . " I do n't know , " he says , " we 've already got more than I ever bargained for . There must be half a million bucks worth of junk right in this casket I 'm resting my tootsies on . Why do n't we just grab what we can and scarper ? " But if the first ' thief has even heard him he gives no indication . He is walking around the sarcophagus , touching it here , tapping it there , looking for invisible levers . He is the complete cynicp92who has trained himself all his life to think in an idiom of Achilles vulnerabilities . He simply does not trust walls . He has a cryptographer 's imagination . In his fingers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man 's for Braille . He is a piano tuner of a man who in some other age or different circumstances might have found the Northwest Passage or the source of the Mississippi . He makes his slow , halting circuit of the sarcophagus . " It 's bonded solid , " he says . " Yeah , " says the second tomb robber , " I could have told you that . Let 's scarper , mate . " " But it 's still on its original platform . " " Its original platform . " " Look down here . See ? The nine inches at the bottom are gilded wood . They must have moved the thing in on rollers , then pulled the rollers out and left it . " " No shit , " the kid says wearily , " so that 's how they did it . The pyramids , now that 's some engineering feat . I mean when you think of the unsophisticated equipment they had . And all the patience ... " " We brought a file . Get the file . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the small pile of tools , finds the file and hands it without interest to the older man . " Bring that torch , hold it down here so 's I can see . I want to study the paint .. . Yes . . . No , a little closer . Watch it , do n't singe me . . . Yeah , see there , where the gilt bunches like badly hung wallpaper ? That 's the fault line . That 's where the wood 's rotting . Where 's that mallet ? All right . " And he drives the file into the dead center of the dead wood , where it sinks like a knife into tender meat . Stretched out on the floor and working at arm 's length , he chips away like a sculptor at the rotting wood . But the file is only a foot long , the sarcophaguswide as a car . He sends the blunt end of the crowbar in after it , pounding at the boxcar connections , trusting as always in the mushy physics by which he lives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by whatever is hard in there and drawn to whatever is soft . He calls for the second tomb robber 's crowbar and fits its blunt end to the protruding wedge of his own . Hep93works in this way for more than an hour  --  a file , an iron , an iron , the ka 's shepherd 's crook and the mallet  --  and is almost through to the other side , but not quite , when he runs out of tools . " Now what ? " the kid asks . " The bunghole . Bleed me a quart of that stuff . Fetch it in one of those vases . " The older robber takes the substance and butters it along the leading edge of the platform . From time to time , to annul the smell , he has the kid wipe his face with a handkerchief that has been drenched in perfume from the first waterskin . " Now . Clear away anything that can burn . Get the torch . " He offers fire to the soaked wood ; slowly it scorches , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fire takes hold . The front third of the platform is burning . The smell is horrible . " All right . The tunnel I 've made inside the platform should act as a firebrake . " He pulls the shepherd 's crook gingerly out of the odd train he has made and quickly substitutes the mallet , shoving it in as far as he can . " Go get the flail out of the double 's fist . You should be able to unscrew it . Good . Stand here behind the sarcophagus with me . We 'll watch the fire . When it burns through to the tools we 'll shove . The front should tip forward fifteen to eighteen inches . That 's a tremendous weight . Maybe the shock will jar the goddamn lid loose . Even if it do n't , we 'll have gravity working for us . We 'll worry it like a loose tooth . All right , when I say shove I want you to push up so hard your palms come out your wrists . " The second robber stands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along the bottom of the platform like fungus , and at exactly the right moment he yells " Shove ! " and puts all his weight into it . " I said shove , you lousy skyver , shove . " And now they both put all they have into it and the massive sarcophagus falls forward the full eighteen inches , making a sound of metal slamming stone . The shock is all the older man could have wished , for the Phoenician can see the thick lid actually stretch , bounce in some irreparable way that sets off tremors in the stone seam that start at the far ends of the lid and meet each other in a ragged , barely visible line . A crack . Hairlinep94but enough , more than enough for this genius , this Columbus of breakage and entrance who would go through it as if it were a door or gate , whose very nature partakes of something like the quality of gas . He puts his crook down and looks up . " Whatever can I have been thinking of ? " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Reach in there , mate , and pull our tools out . " " They 'll be hot . " " Nah , the breeze cooled ' em off when this big mother fell forward . " The young robber fishes the tools out carefully and the older one picks up his crowbar and mallet . " See ? The fire 's about burned itself out , " he says . " Better let me work at this for a while , kid . " Sure enough , he goes  --  this man who has lived life like a key  --  for the seal 's jugular , playing that hairline crack , driving his mallet and crowbar like a poolsharp , playing the angles , putting actual English on his strokes . " I think it 's coming , " the younger man says , and gets up from the throne where he has been resting and takes up his tools . Togetherthey pry and pull and probe and shove , wordless as movers negotiating furniture around the bends in stairs . The lid is loose , and then it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and comes up behind them . There is no glitter of gold and jewels , only a sort of opaque mass . " It 's empty , " the second tomb robber shouts . " No , " says the first . " Those are the palls . You do n't know shit about death , kid . Those are just the linen palls . It 's Death 's hope chest in there , sonny . Here , look . " He stirs the palls and reveals a coffin shaped not like a man so much as some trophy of a man , tight and stern and scowling as an Academy Award . Its skin is a tattoo of hieroglyph and chevron . In the dim light the mummiform coffin gives the appearance of someone fat dressed in unflattering swatches of chain mail . Its surfaces break up the light of the torch held down to investigate , disperse it in weird blue and gold tints on the faces of the robbers . " Pay dirt , " the second tomb robber proclaims after a pause . " Nah , " says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't know woodp95from Shinola . " He appears to feel around the side of the coffin with his fingers and apparently presses some button or lever which triggers a springlock , popping the coffin open like a lady 's compact . Another mummiform coffin is revealed in hand-in-glove relation to the first . " The five hundred hats of Bartholomew Cubbins ! " says the young tomb robber . He places his hands on the tiled , golden scales of the second coffin , palming its lumpy contours as if he were copping a feel . " That 's just gold-plated wood , " the first robber murmurs , " inlaid with glass paste . " So , the Phoenician thinks , not only a mind like a key but a geologist as well . A tailor 's affinity for fabric ; there 's Geiger in him , some litmus vision . Now the older thief feels around the edges of this coffin , his chin raised and an expression on his face as if he is judging the taste of his food . He is exactly like the attendant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will raise the hood of your car . He finds it , and the lid of the second coffin snaps into the contours of the first . The kid tomb robber laughs . " It ai n't any Pharaoh 's mummy at all , it 's a nest of fucking matrioshka dolls . " " Pay dirt , " the first tomb robber says . " That 's gold , my old son , nothing but gold . " " Did you ever ? " The boy whistles . " It 's useless to us . We could n't even lift it . " Nevertheless their eyes travel up the long horizontal shell of the dead king  --  this priceless golden Easter egg of a Pharaoh which seems to float in its sarcophagus as in a bathtub  --  taking in each detail , its crossed arms and big golden gloves that grasp the shepherd 's crook and flail , Pharaoh 's and Osiris ' carrot and stick , its great head in three dimensions like some coin of ultimate denomination . They study the weird sphinxy headdress , oddly like hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not blind so much as distracted , as though its pupils , large and black as handballs , witness somethinggoing on extraordinarily high in the sky . Its sweet lips look as if they taste their own goldenness.  | " Okay , " the older man says , " here we go , then , " and again he touches something , and the last veil groans marginally upward , its great weight lying on it like gravity . " Lift , lift , " the first thief commands , " get the crowbar in , get some leverage . Now prop the lid with your bar . A little more . That 's got it . There . " The mummy itself , exposed now , lies under the final raised lid as under some gold tent protected from sun , and the Phoenician and the kid see what they have come for : the Pharaoh 's funerary mask which has been placed over the head and shoulders of the mummy just as Anubis ' jackal 's head had been fitted onto his human body . For all the delicately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mysteriously bestialized by it . They stare at the fantastic face , prefigured in each of its protective coffins but only as a paper silhouette prefigures flesh . They have not been prepared for this ; all they can do is stare . They are looking at Egypt 's most precious materials  --  gold , lapis lazuli , faience , quartz and chalcedony . The Phoenician himself can not take his eyes from the raised lapis lazuli brows that describean arc from the nose almost to the ears , or from the lapis lazuli lined eyes like the unjoined halves of spectacles . He peers closely at the eyes themselves , stares at the canthi where the angles of the upper and lower lids meet , at the red wattles at the outer and inner edges there , the queer caruncles of God . The second tomb robber looks at the vulture and cobra , symbolsof Upper and Lower Egypt , which seem to grow out of the Pharaoh 's forehead , rising spectacularly , ribbed and thick and aloft as the underedge of erections . The first tomb robber gazes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plaited hocky stick . " All right , " he says , breaking the spell , " let 's get to work . " He takes up a position behind the mummy , and for all his previous delicacy now grabs hold of the mask with both hands and pulls at it roughly . It comes off like a saddle . He puts it down , takes a knife and slashes the bandages . " Hey , man , " says the second tomb robber , " do n't do that . " The first tomb robber lays the knife in the coffin and tears at the bandages with both hands , opening the Pharaoh like a package . The cloth squeals apart and he plunges his hands inside and pullsp97out necklaces , gold rings , bracelets , fingerstalls , a scarab brooch , golden pectorals , a spilled pinata of Tiffany implement . " He was gay , " he laughs . " This was no king ; this was a fucking queen . " He reaches inside once more , gropes and brings out a bandaged parcel , holding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strips like a fisherman dealing line . It is the Pharaoh 's natrondried , embalmed heart . He raises it above his head . " What a good boy am I ! " he shouts , and shoves the heart into his garments with the rest of the jewelry . " Now , mate , now we scarper ! " " Hoy , " says the other . It is too late . Perhaps the noise of the sarcophagus slamming to the floor had alerted them , or the pounding on the coffin seals , or the older man 's shouts , or maybe they 'd been tipped off , but when the thieves gathered their booty and made for the antechamberthe flics were already there , out of breath  --  they 'd been running and , not knowing the way as expertly as the first tomb robber , stumbling  --  but in sufficient numbers to put escape or even struggle out of the question . The Phoenician looks around for officials , and everywhere among the men shouting orders at each other and pressing forward to get a better look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he can make them out . There are chief inspectors , priests ( part clergyman and part guard assigned to protect the tomb ) , higher-ups , ministers and deputies from the court , important civilians who sat in the highest councils  --  all the grace and favored , singers , guests , even popular athletes . It is what he expected . It is a big bust , and his only worry is that harm might come to the tomb robbers through some dumb grandstand play by one of these social commandos before they can be safely hustled out of there . " Hoy , " he shouts in the confusion , " let 's play this one by the books , men . It 's too big to blow in the heat of anger . " He need n't have worried . Obviously acting under the highest orders , the police were almost rougher with the spectators than with the suspects . Quickly they collected the evidence , organized the crowd and marshaled them all out of there . They even thought to leave a detail behind until the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrest was swift and correct . A brief announcement wasp98made to the public and the prisoners were put under special guard . The Phoenician requested that he be permitted to stay with them , but , as he anticipated , this was out of the question . They did permit him to remain in the building where the men were being held , however , a concession that came as something of a surprise . He offered money to the jailer who had told him he would be allowed to stay , but it was politely turned down . In the morning a guard shook him gently awake on the bench where he had sacked out , and even offered him coffee . " Nice day for a hanging , " the fellow said by way of small talk . " Red sky at night , sailor 's delight , " the Phoenician answered . " Say , are there many people around ? " " Outside , you mean ? " " Yes . " " The town 's packed . You ca n't get a room . Everybody 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Are they upset , are they likely to turn ugly ? " " No , I do n't think so . They 're leaving this one strictly to the government . " " That 's a relief . " " Well , " said the guard , " you ai n't seen what the government can do when it 's worked up . " On the surface , at least , the arraignment was as proper as the arrest . The judge  --  the Phoenician , circulating , heard talk that he was a fair man  --  listened impassively to the charges and then requested that the prisoners , Oyp and Glyp , stand . The Phoenician was astonished . So accustomed had he become to seeing them in their disguises , to recognizing them under their dyed hair , through their patiently grown mustaches and beards and behind their surgical alterations and new postures ( Glyp had even trained himself to be left-handed ) , to discounting the red herrings of their changed diction and the falsetto of their acquired tenor , that he had not known them in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd been snakes they 'd have bit me , he thought . I 'll be a goddamn purloined letter . Of course it had been dark in the tomb , and most of the time he 'd been morep99interested in what they were doing than in them , and of course they 'd been under a good deal of pressure so that their speech rhythms had become those he 'd never have anticipated  --  the iambs and dactyls of action and assault being different in kind from those of evasion  --  but still and all he was amazed that he 'd had no clue at all , not the slightest suspicion , and so their identitiesstaggered him . He was so breathless that when the time came for him to speak he was able to do so only with the most supreme effort , and even then only after the tipstaff , seeing his distress , had brought him a glass of water . " Your Honor , " he said , " I 'm Alexander Main , and I wish to go bail for these two . " " There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the judge said gently . " There 's always a question of bail , Your Honor , " he said respectfully . " I appreciate that in the circumstances the bond will necessarily be a high one , but whatever it is I will pay it . I think I can assure the Court , too , that whatever date is fixed upon for the prisoners ' appearance they will be here . " " There is no question of bail , Mr. Main . " " Your Honor , " he pleaded , " look at these men . They are n't master criminals . They 're ordinary . They 're banal men . The state has n't argued in its charges that they 've conspired with others to do this thing , or that they acted as agents , or even that they had contacts with or commitments from known fences in their misadventure . Fortunately , no one was killed or even hurt in their abortive attempt . Also , all the property 's been recovered ; it 's been checked against the catalogs and it 's all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the least valuable pieces in the tomb , and I 've been given to understand that even these are subject to restoration . I 'm told that the cloth-of-gold is even now being dry-cleaned . " He paused . " In short , sir , " he said slyly , " I think that all we 're faced with here is a case of a couple of second-story blokes in under their heads . " The spectators laughed appreciatively at the Phoenician 's joke . Even the judge smiled , but when he banged his gavel to restore order all he did was repeat that there was no question of bail . Main was undeterred . He demanded an explanation of thep100fair man . He asked if under Egyptian law tomb robbers were excluded from bail . A guard moved toward him , but the judge waved him off . " Under Egyptian law , no , " he said . " Are there precedents , then , for such an exclusion ? " " There are no precedents , Mr. Main , because until last night no tomb robbers had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But since we 're on the subject of precedents I would remind you that no precedent ever had a precedent , and that all precedents arise from the oily rags and scraps of tinder condition , law 's and experience 's spontaneous combustion . " The Phoenician did n't wait for the implication of this to register with the crowd . " Does the State have evidence that Mr. Oyp and Mr. Glyp have been linked with other tomb robberies ? " he asked crisply . " None that has been presented to us . " His next question was dangerous , for he knew the true state of affairs . Hoping that the Egyptians did n't , however , he decided to ask it . " Are these men wanted for other offenses ? " " Not to our knowledge . " " Well then , may we not assume that this is a first offense and that the case is much as I presented it and these two much as I described them  --  amateurs whose ambitions exceeded their capabilities ? I do n't mean to prejudice the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ states , I was there , an eyewitness . I saw it all and fully expect to be subpoenaed by the prosecution to give my evidence . I intend to go even further . " He looked around the hearing room , at the judge , the spectators , and finally directly at Oyp and Glyp themselves . " I shall this day present myself to the police , voluntarily to assist them in their inquiries . I shall do this , " he pronounced softly , " but under sworn testimony I shall also feel compelled to reveal what is already known to your investigators  --  that these two did not even bother to bring the proper equipment with them , that they had few tools and those they had massively inadequate to their undertaking . Where was their block and tackle ? Where were their drills and blasting caps ? " In view of all this  --  their amateur status , their faulty prepara/tion and makeshift maneuver , the fact that it was a first offense , that no one was physically harmed , that the suspects were unarmed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the State to establish agency or even to locate possible receivers , and the fact that the actual damage they caused to property in dollars and cents ( I 'm reasoning that the artisans who will be responsible for restoring the objets d'art are slaves ) barely manages to meet the legal definition of felony , and finally the all-important admission by the court that there is nothing in either Egyptian statute or custom which would justify the withholding of bond in this case  --  in view of all this , I respectfully request that the court fix an appropriate bond forthwith . " The judge glared at him , but when he spoke he was as softspokenas before . " Mr. Main , " he said patiently , " have you any idea of what bail , if I should agree to set it , would have to be in this case ? " " I have already indicated that I understand it would be high . " " Yes . It would . " " I 'll pay it . " " Will you ? Whatever the omissions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relatively specific in these circumstances . " " Your Honor ? " " I will give you the exact wording of the statute . . . Here , this is the pertinent language , I think . . . blah blah de dum blah de dum ... Oh , yes : that the forfeiture be equivalent in value to the value of the intended theft . ' " The Phoenician whistled . " Ignoring the worth of the treasures that were undisturbed in the tomb and fixing a value only on those objects found on the prisoners ' persons or waiting to be picked up by them in the antechamber , that would come to  --  well , I have n't the exact figures , but I should think in the neighborhood of , oh , say twenty billion dollars . That 's just a ball park estimate . " " I 'll raise it , " Main rasped . He did n't see how but he would . People were in debt to him for favors  --  the nigger , Billy Basket ( who only this morning had fallen all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , that other one , the guy who worked inp102his cousin 's car wash . It would only be for a short while . He would stay with Oyp and Glyp . He would hire an army to stay with them . It was true that the Mafia was down on him right now , but there were others , retired guards and nightwatchmen in Cincinnati who would help him baby-sit the two of them . Oyp 's and Glyp 's freedom would be nominal only , but it was necessary that he buy it for them . " I 'll raise it , " he repeated . " Has it occurred to you that your fees alone would cost Mr. Oyp and Mr. Glyp two thousand million dollars ? That such a figure might be prohibitive for them ? " " There 's two of them , " Main shouted , " it 's only a thousand million apiece ! " " The police report lists them as indigents , " the judge said calmly . The Phoenician glared at the two . Tinhorns , he thought . Cheap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He swallowed hard . " A personal favor , " he said . " It 's on the cuff . I waive my fee . " " There is no question of bail , " the judge said . " Why ? " Main demanded . " Nothing in the statutes prevents it . " " There are laws and there are laws , " the judge said , " crimes and crimes . Degrees of guilt like figures on thermometers . There are acts which so far exceed the permissible that to define them in statutes would be to register them in the imagination . And we 're talking now of legislators who would have to write these laws , who would subject would , ideally , occur to the best of men . To acknowledge that the best of men , thinking ideally and plotting academically , platonically and picturesquely , could conceive of these actions , would be to admit that ordinary men , with none of the superior man 's built-in checks and balances of the heart and mind , could do the same , opening up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and declining the corrupt like a verb wheel of evil , some irregularized grammar of the monstrous that would turn the unspeakable into only a sort of French . And what of men who are not ordinary ? Who live below the timberline ofp103grace ? What of bad men ? What of the vicious , of villains , the ugly customer and the mad-dog killer ? What of them ? What perversions of the senators ' only abstract paradigm of evil would they be capable of ? What argot and babble and moral solecism and sheer bone-breaking noise ? What 's unthinkable requiresno legislation , eschews statute and repudiates law . There 's no question of bail . " " Ostriches , " Main shouted . " You 're ostriches . You bury your Pharaohs in the sand with their eggs . " " How can the unthinkable be defined ? " the judge asked sincerely . " Unthinkable ? What 's unthinkable ? How many Pharaohs have died ? Fifty ? A hundred ? Their tombs are like slums . Everywherebusted windows and the plumbing ripped out to get cash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the lead in the paint . The doors are broke down and the stairs are missing , the furniture 's askew and what 's too heavy to carry gets broken up . And every generation the neighborhood changing and every dynasty the desert a little less safe at night . Good God , there are n't any playgrounds , kids play wall ball on the Pyramids , write Fuck on the Sphinx . What 's unthinkable ? Bond these men . What 's unthinkable ? " " For a crime like theirs ? " the judge growled . " Not just breakersand enterers but ghouls , and not just ghouls but ghouls against the state , and not just ghouls against the state but ghouls against God . Handling His things , picking and choosing among His leftoverslike junkmen . Derelicts who 've never seen the inside of a museum assigning value to God 's wardrobe and effects , fingering His empty garments , trying them on . Take this , not that , these , not those . How do you think I look in this , Oyp ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' Oyp had Pharaoh 's heart in his pocket . " " I told you , Oyp ! " Glyp shouted . " I told you not to do that ! " " They siphoned His juices like there was gas rationing . They wiped it up from the floor using His cloth-of-gold as if it was toilet paper . They slashed bandages and let in air , diluting the natron . A dozen embalmers worked an entire season preparing His soil , polishing His seed to last an eternity . They divotedp104His course with their knives and crowbars and banged His sarcophagus like boys do drums . " Yes , thinks Main , what a bond this would make ! What a feather in my cap ! " They set His platform on fire and tilted it like cheats at pinball . They clumsied His corpse and sat on His throne like Weathermen in an occupied boardroom . They used his Double familiarly and snatched His crook and filched His flail . And not just ghouls against God who goosed and grab-assed above their station , but who stoppered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but to nothingness , who exiled Him , annihilating His soul and sending it to graze in no man 's land beyond the twelve-mile limit . Bond them ? Bond them ? " " There 's something else , " the Phoenician says . " There 's something else , though . " " Please , " the judge says , " there can be no bail in this case . " " They 're wanted in another state . " " Please ? " " They 're wanted in Ohio . " He produces the warrant which he always carries and hands it to a bailiff who brings it to the bench . The judge examines it . " There can be no bond , " he says . " They 're fugitives , " Main shouts . " I 've been hunting them for years . " " No bond . " " They got away from me . They 're the only ones who ever did . " " No bond . Bond is refused . " " It could n't happen again , " Main pleads . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the Phoenicianknows the hearing is over . Then the judge makes an astonishing statement . He instructs the guards to release the prisoners . If there are crimes , he says , that are so unthinkable that no laws can proscribe them , then they must be of such magnitude that no punishment can redress them . Oyp and Glyp were free to go . The Phoenician trembled . The fugitives were fugitives still ,  |p105fugitives  once from his scrutiny and control , then from his intercession , and now from earth itself . Fugitives from the bullying freedom he needed to give them who till now could stand between the law and its violators , having that power vouchsafed to him , the power to middleman , to doodle people 's destiny ; the power , like a natural right , to put killers back on the streets and return the lunatics to their neighborhoods ; the good power to loose the terrible , to grant freedom where he felt it was due , more magisterial than a king , controlling the sluices and locks of ordinarylife , adjusting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , poisoning the streets with possibility . But Oyp and Glyp were fugitives from fugitiveness itself , and because they were , there were limits to his power and his own precious freedom . He groaned in his bed , chewed a piece of his pillowcase , twisted in his smooth hotel sheets , moaned , objected , knew helplessness , awoke and was embarrassed to discover that his dream was not just a dream but a wet dream . And sure enough , when he switched on his bedside lamp and looked , there was his cobra cock and , still spilling from it , the white sweet venom of his come . He did not speculate about the dream 's meaning . He 'd lived with its meaning for years , since his hair had thinned and his belly bloomed , since his legs had begun to go and his reflexes climb down from true , since his aches and since his pains and his BM 's became irregular and he could see into the stream of his weakened piss . Not that death held any particular horror for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offense against Nature . Indeed , he might quite welcome that . He was sick of his slick contempt , his ability to win which had never left him , his knack of topping the other guy . It took a dream to beat him , and even then he was the dreamer , the judge no more than dummy to his ventriloquist . But the other thing , the other thing . Curiosity was killing the cat . Oyp and Glyp were his only failures , but Oyp and Glyp in life were as they had been in his dream : punks , losers . Their collective bond  --  this was somethingp106which surprised him whenever he remembered it , or contemplated one of those expensive safaris which would take him across the country or out of it when a rumor ripened and fell his way  --  had been less than eleven hundred dollars . Not masterminds , not arch criminals , just ordinary car thieves . Probably they were alreadydead , or living through an anonymity that was as close to death as one could come . Split up by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Perhaps in some Mexican or Central American jail , too poor or too guilty to obtain lawyers , more sinned against than sinning and , because they were dim , without the mother wit to enlist the help of their embassy , thinking , We 're wanted men anyway , why jump out of the frying pan into the fire ? Best to stay here , rot for the twenty to thirty years these greasers gave us than get ourselves extradited , go back , make all that fuss , be locked up in Ohio or maybe even some Federal pen because we jumped bail . Does n't that bring the Feds into it ? Shit , we 're warm enough here , do n't even speak the lingo , which is an advantage since nobody kicks us around too much because we do n't understand . He 'd spent five times what he 'd lost on them already . And put in how many weeks of sleep dreaming of them ? But now his dreams  --  this dream  --  had turned , exalting them . Why , they were exalted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bondsman . The meaning of his life . The way he came to terms with what engined it . Mystery . Why he lived with the cops and the robbers . Why he bothered to eat with his bondsmen colleaguesin Covington . Why he was a regular around City Hall , the municipal courts , the Federal halls of justice , on a first-name basis not just with the small-time hoods and criminals of passion but with their families as well , their partners and girl friends . Crime was the single mystery he could get close to . Did he know astronomy ? Had he the brains for the higher mathematics or the physics of even thirty or forty years ago ? Could he read Spanish or follow a score ? Did he know history or even what the symptomsof his own body signified ? Could he write a prescription or mix paint ? And it was not true what he told his clients : that their guilt or innocence did not matter to him and that his only considerationp107was whether they would run or stay put . It mattered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free them . All that did not matter was the verdict , but in his own mind he always reached a verdict , and he was certain that by virtue of his unique relationshipit was at least as accurate as the law 's . Mystery . Mystery kept him going and curiosity killed him . His limited detective heart made him a Cincinnatian , kept him in this city of exactly the right size . And still he bit off more than he could chew , a tapeworm working in his brains . Mystery . He showered , washing the scum from his long old balls , dried himself with distaste on the already damp towels , disposed of his pajamas in the wastebasket , dressed . Only then , when he was strapping on his watch , did he see the time : it was only eleven o'clock . He picked up his room key , went down in the elevator and left it wordlessly with the night man at the desk . Hungry , he went into the coffee shop and ordered soup , a ham sandwich , coffee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mystery . ) The dream had moved him forcibly . He had already forgottenOyp and Glyp , as he forgot all clients once he was finished with them . They were n't in it anymore . It was their crime : that was what exalted them , freed them from him , that he could n't get out of his mind . Why could n't he , who dreamed the crime , dream the success of his plea to the judge ? Mystery . ( Did he know the chemistry of even fifty years ago , classics , the future ? He did n't even know natural history ; without the cards by the specimens in the cases in the museum he could not have told you about the teeth which so fascinated him . ) Now a dream precipitated his actions , forced his hand , gave him hunches in the dark like a numbers player . He paid up and cleared out , turning down the doorman who offered to get a taxi for him . " I 've had my taxi ride today , " he said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew , of course , knew the routes and times of the last buses , knew the city inside out , knew all the fixed , specific mystery of Cincinnati , Ohio . He took a Vliet Avenue bus to Rosendale and transferred to the Koch  --  Demaret which took him up Glad Boulevard and by the park , then past Hebrew Union College and the Universityp108of Cincinnati whose tall twin buildings , Physics and Chemistry , faced each other like upended keys . The bus entered a narrow wedge of ghetto . Three blacks in big hats whose wide brims flopped down over their eyes stood down from the curb and waved at a request stop . The Phoenician knew the driver would not stop for them . He wondered how it would work out , what crises and bloodlettings were still to take place , and tried to imagine what assassinations of which leaders yet unborn would have to be endured , and conjured issues , slogans and even men as meaninglessand dissociative as scores in a vacuum . He thought in headlinesof distant centuries : TRENT REPUDIATES GENNIS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SCARVES , MARCH ON STATEHOUSE . MERPEN PLEADS HUNDRED AND SEVENTH . REMEMBER NEBRASKA ! But even these were built on analogue . He was depressed by language , the finite slang of his century . SHOTCHKA QUENTZ VISARBLEMENTHS . He needed new endings , new punctuation , a different grammar . There would be people , and they would believe things he could not even imagine . There would be two sides to every question . Trent would be right and Gennis would be right , though in its lifetime the public would never know the whole story . Amortization of the epicenter would be only a short-term solution to whatever problem it had been created to solve . A stopgap , at best only a first halting step . And it was all very well to remember Nebraska , but a time would come when it would be best to forget old wounds . There would be different holidays , epic festivals celebrating heroes who would not be born for a thousand years yet . And in all the countries in the world , on all the calendars the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would they have pulled off ? What drugs were coming ? What soups and styles , and how would the center line on the highway be made when the paint mines dried up and the pigments rationed ? Or legislated against , green outlawed and blue controversial and orange repealed ? How he envied them , the man in the street , the pockmarked dropout of some future millennium , how he was sickened at the thought of the punch lines of jokes he could not understand evenp109if they were patiently explained to him . What answers they would so casually have ! Their 90 IQ 's would encompass wisdoms that the greatest minds of today could not even begin to comprehend . The more things changed , it was said , the more they remained the same . That was bullshit , just one more justification and excuse , another good word put in for death . It was a terrible thing Oyp and Glyp had done . How I envy them ! How glad I am I was there to see it ! It was his stop . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hotel . Although it was a residential hotel , with its wide horseshoe drive and massive quarter moons of carefully tended lawn , its groundfloor ballroom with its sequence of tall leaded windows like five big fingertips , the Vernon Manor had the look of a resort hotel of the Twenties . It might have looked more in place along the shore . Far from downtown , it seemed an awry speculation to the Phoenician whenever he came upon it . He rather liked the hotel , enjoyed the old ladies in their seventies with their clean thin hair that always reminded him of the fish-scale blue one sees in chemical toilets on airplanes . He enjoyed the big white uniformed colored women who pushed their wheelchairs or steadied them on their sticks as they bobbed along , or helped them into their cars and took the wheel to drive them to their doctor appointments . Not all the residents were cripples , but all seemed frail , their survivorship underscoring their frailty , their neatness and grooming a testament to the care they had to take of themselves . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strict accountancy signaling necessity rather than a careful husbandry for the benefit of sons and daughters and grandchildren ( they seemed as bereft of these as of husbands ) . It cheered the Phoenician to think of their clever economies , shrewdened them in his eyes . They were like hunters who killed to eat . He pictured them still awake , in front of their television sets or entering figures in ledgers from the financial pages , sippinghot water and lemon to outwit their bowels , warm milk their insomnia . What did they make of the world ? ( Mystery ,  |p110mystery  . He did not know them . Old ladies did not come to him for bail . ) In the lobby he moves toward the small bank of elevators where the night porter snoozes in a chair . " Sir ? " the night clerk says . Main goes up to him , stands by the darkened candy cases , the low revolving tree of post card , the wide magazine rack , tomorrow 's Enquirer , the headline showing through a window in the yellow vending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the signs above the beauty parlor and dress shop , drained of neon and dusty as empty alembic . He glances past the night clerk into the message boxes , the few keys that spill out of their mouths like tongues . " May I help you ? " " I do n't think so . " " You 're not a guest ? " " No . " " I 'm afraid the dining room is closed . We serve our last meal at ten . " " That 's all right , I 've eaten . " " Are you visiting someone in the hotel ? " " Yes . " " May I ask if you 're expected ? " " I 'm not expected . " " It 's almost one . I 'll have to ring up and announce you . " " Tell Crainpool Mr. Main is downstairs . " The clerk shrugs , goes to the switchboard , plugs into Crainpool'sroom and speaks softly into the thin prosthetic gear that runs from his ear to his chin . He looks up at Main and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He says he 'll be down as soon as he can get dressed . " " I 'll go up . " The clerk is about to protest , but Alexander has already turned and shaken the porter awake . " Five , " he says . He has to repeat himself to the groggy man . In the elevator he glances at the framed menus high on the wall , reads the cheerful Good Morning ! from the closed coffee shop . It is old news . The elevator door opens in a cul-de-sac . There is gray and faded floral carpeting , hard upholstered benches where the oldp111people sit while waiting for the elevator . He turns left and left again and goes down the long corridor past the housekeeper 's closets and old-fashioned hollow metal doors that belly the hall . Crainpool 's room is at the far end of the corridor . There are hotel offices across from him and a housekeeping closet next door . He turns the knob on Crainpool 's door , but it is locked . He bangs on it with his fist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his pajama tops and an old blue bathrobe , opens it . " Mr. Main . " " It 's after hours , Crainpool . We do n't have to be so formal after hours . " " Has something happened ? Have there been mass arrests on the campus ? I was sleeping ; I did n't see the eleven o'clock news . Do we have to go downtown ? Just give me a minute to put on my clothes . " " Nice place you got here . " " It 's comfortable . " " Small , compact , but I expect it meets your requirements . Just get lost in someplace larger . " " Yes , sir . " " Rattle around . " " I guess I would . " " Yet your needs are taken care of . " He pounds the swollen metal door . " Hotel has a laundry and dry-cleaning service , I suppose . " " It does , yes , sir , but it 's pretty expensive . I do n't often use it . " " Wash out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ? Hang ' em to dry on the rod in the bath ? " " Well , yes , sir , I do . " " Yes . I see . I see you do . " He has strolled into the small bathroom . Underwear swims in the sink ; two shirts hang on hangers above the tub , dripping water half . on the tile and half in the bath ; handkerchiefs stretch over the radiators like canvas on Conestoga wagons ; a pair of pajamas dry on a wooden rack in the corner . Main unzips his fly and pees into his employee 's toilet . He does not close the door or raise the seat . " These pajamas , " he says . " Sir ? "  | " I was saying these pajamas , " he calls over the splash of his pee , " what happened to the nightshirt I gave you for Christmas ? Do n't you use it ? " " Well , I thought that was meant as a joke , sir . " He walks back into the room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a joke ? And the nightcap , did you think the nightcap was a joke , too ? " " Well , sir  --  " " The trouble with you , Crainpool , is that you do n't take things seriously . Playful yourself , you assume that everyone else has your sense of humor . A joke ! That was a business investment , Mr. Crainpool , a business investment . I took it off my taxes . I thought that nightshirt and cap would solidify your image , help put you in the proper frame of mind for what 's wanted . A joke indeed ! Like the garters , I suppose . Like the quill pens and the high stool . I 've taken a great many pains , Mr. Crainpool  --  and gone to considerable expense , too , I might add  --  to reinforce your clerk 's ambience , to clericalize you . Yet you persist in your taste for the newfangled . I suppose you 've been thinking in terms of electric typewriters and Xerox machines . What 's next , sir , conference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is unavailable right now . Your message will be recordedand played back for him when he returns . Please begin speaking when you hear the electronic bleep . . . Bleep . ' " " No , sir . " " No , sir . ' You 're damned right , sir , no sir . And what happens to the thick ledgers with the careful rulings inked down the center of the page ? The big gray and black cardboard boxes with their snaps and clasps and their colors running like a melted zebra ? To the huge checkbooks like a family album ? What do we do , throw them all out , I suppose ? " " I 'm sorry , sir , " Crainpool says , trying not to giggle . " Yes , sir . I should think you would be . It is n't as if I 've tried to trespass in your private life . . . Well , have I ? " " No , sir . " " No . You did n't see the eleven o'clock news , you said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provided , is itp113not ? You need n't answer ; I see it . Television is provided . Three networks and an educational channel at your disposal . There is the telephone . I see an air-conditioning unit . I rode up here in an elevator . " " Yes , sir . " " I was under no obligation to provide you with such lavish mod cons . None of the advantages you enjoy  --  there 's the electric light , there 's the flush toilet  --  were actually coming to you . " " No , sir . " " My first thought was to set you up in a boardinghouse . Such places still exist , you know , though admittedly they are scarcer now than when you first came into service . " " Yes , sir . " Crainpool is trying very hard to keep a straight face . " Go on , go on , continue dressing . " " Then we 're going downtown ? " " Then I thought , no , though a boardinghouse would be the proper place for you and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in you which I was looking for , it might have certain drawbacks . You might not have liked your neighbors  --  or you might have liked some of them too much , fallen in with the wrong sort , made yourself vulnerable at the dinner hour or in the lounge on Sunday . You 'd have had to share a bath , do n't forget . " " Yes , sir . " Crainpool is buttoning his shirt . " You would n't have had your own phone . You 'd have been roused at all hours to take other people 's messages . The walls in such places are paper thin . A fellow roomer 's radio could have kept you up half the night . " " Yes , sir , I suppose that 's true , sir . " " Then I found this place for you , did n't I ? " " You did . " " Yes . Then I found this place for you . A quiet residential hotel . Genteel . Yet with all the latest up-to-the-minute features you could possibly wish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Do all the floors have it ? " " Some do , but the patterns vary , I think . "  | " You think . Only what you see when the elevator opens to take on a passenger . I take it , then , that you have no close friends in the hotel . Only the odd nodding acquaintance in the lobby and coffee shop . " " That 's about it , sir . " He has begun to put on his tie . " So I thought . No , do n't bother about the tie . " " I 'll just get my jacket , sir . " He puts on his jacket and looks at the Phoenician . " I 'm ready . " " Ready ? " " To go downtown with you . " " No , no , it 's after business hours ; I already told you that . Shop 's closed . You 'll have to remember these things , Mr. Crain-pool . " " We 're not going downtown ? " " We 're not . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been waiting for the Phoenician and returns to the center of the room . " Would you like to sit down , sir ? " " Thank you , Crainpool . Too bad there 's only the one chair . " Crainpool sits primly on his bed . " To what do I owe this honor ? " he says at last . " To bad dreams . To my poor scores in the hard subjects . To your vulnerable history . " Crainpool blushes and it is the first time in years . Their cat-andmousehad settled years before into a rhetoric , glancing off Crainpool like punch lines rained down on fools in comedy turns , touching him as little . Over the years he has become a stunt man , his bruises routinized , his flexible rubber bones deepsea'dfathoms beneath his skin and his nerves and pride Atlantisized , lost continented . The blush is not embarrassment but fear , and Main recognizes it because he has seen it once before . " Are n't you satisfied with my work , Mr. Main ? " " Perfectly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sees ideas squeezing in his brain like turds . " Oyp and Glyp , " he says breathlessly , " you found Oyp and Glyp . " " Oyp and Glyp are dead . "  | " Dead ? " " Or captured . Split up , perhaps . Gone straight , could be . Marriedwith kids . Working in factories or fueling jets on the runway . With the Highway Department , waving red flags to stop the traffic while the road 's being fixed . Or selling door-to-door , or moving The Watchtower . Hired hands , maybe , or taken up cooking . In Dobb 's House management , Dairy Queen . Studying the motel trade . " " You have information ? " " Who has information ? Nah , they 're dead . " " Have you given up on them , sir ? " " The bailbondsman 's statute of limitations , Mr. Crainpool , the Phoenician 's sanctuary , Main 's pardon  --  they have it all . " " Gee . " " That surprise you ? " " I thought you 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Never find ' em . They 're vanished . Cut my losses like a tailor . God told me that in a vision . " " Yes , sir . Good advice . " " What , that ? That 's how He answers all prayer . " " Oh , " Crainpool says . " That lawyer called , Avila . He told me to tell you that Mr. Withers is back and that he 'll appear as scheduled . " " Anything else ? " " Just before I closed up , the desk sergeant from the Fourth District called in with some leads about the arraignments . I tried to reach you at home . " " Something interesting ? " " Well , they 've picked up a suspect for that bank robbery . They think they have enough evidence to hold him . I left a messagewith your answering service and asked the girl to call before you left in the morning . " " All right . " " Would you like some coffee , sir ? There 's only the hot plate , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some if you 'd like . " " You 're losing the thread . " " Sir ? "  | " You 're losing the thread . Of the conversation . I make this extraordinary late-night visit and an absolutely unique allusion to your past to which you duly react , and now you 're losing the thread of the conversation . You 're not out of the woods yet , you know , Mr. Crainpool . " " I know that , sir , " he says shyly . " That 's better . Tell me , Crainpool , did you blush like that when you beat up your wife and put her in hospital ? " " I did n't have the opportunity to study myself , sir . " " No , of course you did n't . Did you have the opportunity when you heard three weeks later , and you were already out on my bond , that there was a fire in her ward and that she 'd burned to death ? " " Mr. Main , " Crainpool says , " that was sixteen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Certainly . And you 'll be able to take whatever advantage of it you can once I turn you over to the police . Be sure to mention it to them . Tell your lawyer . " " You 're turning me in ? Jesus , Phoenician , that was sixteen years ago that happened . I 've been your goddamn slave eleven years . You 're turning me in ? " " Which among us craps jellybeans , Mr. Crainpool ? " " Sixteen years and you 're turning me in ? " " No , lad , I 'm killing you . I 'm going to kill you . " " The statute of  --  " " That 's between you and the State of Ohio . We have a contract . " He pats his breast pocket . " Nothing about any old statute of limitations in this . You jumped my bail . Do I have to read it to you ? Good God , man , you 've worked for me eleven years . You 've seen thousands of these contracts , you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consenting to the application of such force as may be necessary to effect your return . " Crainpool jumps up from the bed . " Let 's go , " he says crisply and smiles . " 1 consent ! " He begins to laugh . " I consent , I consent . Draw your gun and stick it in my ear , I consent ! " The Phoenician studies him . " You 're putting up an even biggerstruggle than I anticipated . Best sit back down , son . Sit down , honey . "  | " But I consent , " Crainpool whines . " My life should retain credibility , " the Phoenician says . " Listen , Mr. Main , " the man pleads , " let me off . " " Hush , Crainpool . " He looks at his man . " Tell me what you 're thinking . " " What I 'm thinking ? I 'm scared stiff . " " Please , " Main says reassuringly , " be calm , take time . Nothing will happen yet . What are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but hesitates . " Yes ? " Main coaches . " That our arrangement was n't such a bad one , " Crainpool says finally . The Phoenician sighs , disappointed . " You 're trivial , you 're a trivial man , " he says . " Me too . Well-a-day , Crainpool , me too . All I can think to do right now is satisfy you . I put myself in your shoes and I think , He 's mad , he wo n't do it , he 'll never get away with it . ' I 'd want scenario , demand explanation like a last cigarette , civilized denouement like a detective 's professional courtesy in the drawing room and even the murderer 's glass filled . Do you feel any of that ? " " I do . Yes . A little . I do . " Main looks at Crainpool suspiciously . " I hope you do . There are conventions , ceremonies . The mechanics are explained but never the mysteries . Foh . Look at me . I 'm a parade . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is how I broke the case . You need to know anything like that ? " " Sure , " Crainpool says . " You 're not just stalling for time , are you ? " " Not entirely . " " Because to tell the truth I have n't made my mind up yet . Not absolutely . I 'm more likely to kill you than not , but nothing'sbeen finalized . " " How 'd you break the case , sir ? " " Do n't patronize me , you son of a bitch ! " " Take it easy . " The Phoenician stands . " You wo n't rush me , will you ? " " No . " " You wo n't fling the pillows at me ? "  | " I 'm wanted , I 'm a wanted man . You did n't break in . The clerk called and I agreed to see you . " " That 's right . Look , kid , stall . Stall for time , do n't make suddenmoves . " " All right , " Crainpool says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away with a thing like this ? " " That 's it , that 's the way . Good , " the Phoenician says , " good . " And he begins to tell him , feeding him detail , inventing his plausible arrangements as he goes along , reassuring himself as he annihilates loophole , shutting off Crainpool 's harbors and posting guards at his roadblocks , at his gangways and airline check-in counters , watching Crainpool 's trains . And it is all true , even if it is only a sort of foreign language he has learned to speak , the flashy grammar of body contact , a shoptalk of which he is weary because no one has yet bested him at it , least of all this dim Crainpool . And he sees that the man takes it all in , held , not just stalling but actually interested , a disciple to his own destroyer . Puppy ! The Phoenician punishes him with strategy , game plan , pressing Crainpool 's nose to the blackboard where the y 's and x 's of opposition spray chalk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what has held him all these years , kept him in town while the Phoenician was off rounding up jumpers ; not only what kept him when Main was n't looking , but what brought him to the office earlier than usual at such times , and what held him there later , after hours , waiting for a phone call that would check up on him , wanting to hear even if only at long distance what normally he got in person , feeding on comeuppance , humiliation , wisecrack , connoisseur of the Phoenician 's abuse . I am his life 's work , the Phoenician thinks . I have rehabilitatedhim . He has gone straight man . So he pours it on , showers Crainpool with spurious inevitability , moves him to object only to shut him off at the pass . " Such force as may be necessary to effect my return , " Crainpoolsays triumphantly . " Asshole . I 'll return you . You 're a fucking deposit bottle . " " Suppose I shout ? Suppose I shout , Do n't shoot , Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fucked up fucking fuck . I shout louder . Call the police , ' I shout , Crainpool 's got my gun . ' " " Shmuck . What about the police ? Why did n't you bring them to arrest me ? " " First principles . Shmuck yourself , I 'm a bondsman . My reputationdepends upon doing my own enforcing . " " You harbored me . Eleven years you harbored me . " " I harbored somebody who called himself Crainpool . In the five years it took me to catch up with you , you 'd aged beyond recognition . You 'd lost hair . You were seventy-five pounds lighter than when you jumped my bond . Your mama would n't have known you . " " The perfect crime , " Crainpool says appreciatively . " You 're in season . It is n't even crime . " The man nods ; he is satisfied that it can be done . Probably he 'd never doubted it . But he still does n't understand why . " I was your slave , " he says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raises , paid vacations , fringe benefits . The first bondsman 's clerk in the State of Ohio with his own retirement plan . " " I do n't want to die , " Crainpool says . " My God , Mr. Main , why would you do this ? " " Because , " he says quietly , " you 're the only man in the world I 'm allowed to kill . " He has drawn his gun . Crainpool begins to whimper , and the Phoenician is moved . He owes this forlorn man more than the fringe benefit of his theatrics . " How , " he asks , " can there be indifference ? How can there be suicides ? Why are there old men ? Help me , Crainpool . Why is life so lovely ? The night sweeter than the day and the day more joyous than the night ? Who alive can grieve ? How dare there be good weather , seasons when the world is at room temperature ? Where are my muscles , my smooth skin ? Why does n't desire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing which remainsintact , that has some fucking strangle hold on immortality ? Who sabotaged us and gave our will insomnia ? Why am I more interested in others than others are interested in me ? What am I to make of their scents , their firm bodies and their healthyp120hair ? Of the snatches of conversation I overhear , the endearmentspassed like bread ? Who wired this tension in me between ego and detachment ? Why do I have this curiosity like a game leg ? How can I cross-examine the universe when it jumps my bond ? " He begins to feel a little of what he has been saying . Crainpoolis alive too , and his determination to kill him momentarily wavers . He sees it as a stunt , one more thing to impress this man who has lived eleven years with and for such impressions and who would , in the instant he squeezed the trigger ( first the wild warning shot overhead or out the window to establish alibi  --  Crainpool would understand , having lived so long in ringsideconnection to technique , a first-nighter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , would perhaps even roar " Author , author . Bravo , bravo " to his own death  --  to make the point that in this small room , in these close quarters , he could not possibly have missed his man and had given him a chance to come quietly ) , probably smile , appreciation riding his lips like dessert , recognition sparking campfires in his eyes . " Look at me , Mr. Crainpool . I take all the papers . I. F. Stone wrote me newsletters . I have Scientific American . The Journal of the American Medical Association is on the floor by my bed . National Geographic is in the toilet , American Heritage next to the toaster . Time-Life gives me the prepublication discount . Au courant I am as a deb with my nose for trend and influence and my insider 's thousand knowledges . What does it mean ? EverythingI do n't know and will never know leans on me like a mountain range . It creams me , Crainpool . It potches my brains and rattles my teeth . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I wish I had a tenth your brains . " " Yeah . Same here . I wish I had a tenth yours  --  anyone 's , everyone 's . I 'd fatten on your memory and experience like a starver , suck at your inputs and engrams as at sweet fruit . What 's the future going to be like , Mr. Crainpool ? What will people whistle a hundred years from now ? What snatch of song will run through the beautician 's head as she leans forward over ap121customer 's hair ? Tell me and I 'll let you go . What will the prioritiesbe ? What ruins will yet be uncovered , what treasures from what sunk ships will rise from which seas ? What cities will be built and destroyed and uncovered again ? Whose teeth will come up in the earthquake and go in the case ? " " I do n't understand . " " Me too . Nothing . Me too . The ocean beds are squeezing together , did you know that ? They tow the continents like tugboats . Asia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man standing in Italy will cast a shadow in Yugoslavia . Nations shall be resolved like a jigsaw , Mr. Crainpool , and what we call land will one day form a perfect circle , a globe within a globe that sits on the oceans like a skullcap . What a seashore that will be ! Like a wet nimbus , Crainpool ! Who 'll drive the Golden Spike that first day ? What language will he speak ? " He fires the first shot . It goes out Crainpool 's open window and clears the four-story building across the way . " That will merely wake some of them , " he says . " Wait , you 'll hear . " They listen together and can barely make out the sound of one or two doors opening down the corridor . Somewhere a window scrapes open . " Is everything all right ? " someone shouts from the dark street . The Phoenician levels the gun at Crainpool 's chest in case he calls out . " No , " he whispers . Then to Crainpool in his previous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just the world , the earth . Have you considered astronomy , have you given any thought to physics ? " " No , " Crainpool says dryly .

" " You asshole , Mr. Crainpool . We 're blind . We ought to have white canes and dark glasses . There should be pencils in our caps . We should sit in the weather against tall buildings and use the caps as offices . Listen , listen to me . They 've proof that all life is merely four simple compounds arranged on a spiral string ofp122sugars and phosphates . We 're necklaces , Crainpool , sugar and spice and everything nice . We 're fucking candy . And your cocksucker and muffdiver are only guys with a sweet tooth . Listen , listen , there 's a theory now that certain things move faster than light . They think that atoms were lighter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a universe that puts on weight , that builds its body like a Sumo . " " I do n't follow . " " I do n't lead . " " Please , Mr. Main  --  " He is talking very quickly now . " I hear tell that matter enters our universe from another universe . That we get our physical laws from some universe in another country . That gravity comes like the post , imported like teak and coffee beans . Physical law like an unfavorable balance of payments . Our ways are not their ways , Mr. Crainpool . Jesus , atoms , atoms and the crap between stars . " " Why are you killing me ? " " Hush . Einstein 's theory posited objects of infinite density within an infinitely small space . You see ? Their atoms would be so fat and their gravity so dense that not even light could escape from them . That was a darkness , fella . Can you imagine such a darkness ? That was a darkness so dark it was invisible . You could read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Wheeler and Ruffini predicted that by their x-rays we would know them  --  are you keeping up , are you getting any of this ?  --  that they 'd give themselves away circling visible stars , nibbling at them with their infinite gravity , drawing at them , giving the stars a tooth-ache . " " I do n't know why you want to kill  --  " " They 've been seen ! In recent months . They 've been detected . The black holes in the universe . " " I do n't want you to shoot me , Mr. Main . " " And for every black hole there 's a white hole . That 's what Hjellming thinks , how he accounts for the quasars . Are you readingme , Crainpool ? The universes are leaking into each other . There 's this transfusion of law in the sky . I 'm honest , I 'm anp123honest man . Upright and respectable here in this universe I inhabit . I 'm honest , but the fucking laws are leaking , the physical constants bleeding into each other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , some holy puncture , Nature 's and reality'ssacred flat . Matter and anti-matter . Inside our universe is another . Dig ? Chinese boxes of universes . When I kill you in your room here tonight , maybe that 's virtue next-door . You think ? " " Why ? Please , Mr. Main , why ? " " Shut up about why . I do n't know why ! " Crainpool changes his tactics . He stops whining and becomes almost angry . " You always have to have the last word , " he says . " You always have to do things big , do n't you ? Big shot . You 'd kill me for nothing , for the sake of your style . " " My style ? Nah . " " You would . You think you 're so hot . " " Me ? No , I 'm catching cold , I 'm in a draft , I 've got this chill . Brr , Crainpool , it 's the Ice Age in me , record snowfalls and not enough antifreeze in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gross thick atoms . Can you see me ? Can you make me out ? " " I see you . I make you out . Like you said  --  you 're a parade . " " Do n't believe everything they tell you , killer . I do n't give a fart for me . You can have my personality for a Green Stamp . My ego wore out years ago . Call Goodwill Industries , I 'll put it in a box on the front porch they can pick it up . Crainpool , dummy , this is n't heroics , it ai n't no grandstand here . I 'm a functionalilliterate , I do n't know my ass from my elbow mysterywise . If I ca n't stand being a fool , it 's got nothing to do with pride . Screw the bubble reputation , I say , fuck fame and shove I. Gobble genes and blast being . I pass . " Crainpool has had to strain to hear this last , leaning so far forwardthat he can almost pluck the gun from Main 's lap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he says . " All I wanted , " Main says so quietly that the clerk has to watch his lips to understand him , " was to know things . I 'm honest , I 'm an honest man . I took delight in the impersonal . I 've lived with curiosity like the seven-year itch . That 's what at/tracted me to you guys , you mugs and malefactors , you villains and cutpurses . Who done it ? What 's the motive ? Cherchez la f emme . What 's that ? What does crime come to at last ? Nothing . Crummy hornbook , lousy primer . Slim volume , Crainpool , pot fucking boiler , publisher 's remainder . You taught me nothing , mister . And where did I get the idea that by getting next to aberration I could . . . But what hurts , I mean what really hurts , is that if I had a brain as big as the Ritz I still would n't know anything . We die dropouts . All of us . Disadvantaged and underachievers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with questions . I never needed to be happy ; I only needed to know . Simple stuff . A dopey kid of the next century could tell me . If I could only live long enough I would sit at his feet as if he was Socrates and he 'd tell me . . . What ? Whether Dubuque ever made it into the majors . If there 's crab grass on distant planets . Who won the war and what they were supposed to be fighting for and old Uncle Tom Cobbly and all . He 'd rattle off the damn fool slogansof his time and I 'd take them in like the Ten Commandments . What do I do with my wonder , I wonder ? " Crainpool stands up . He squeezes himself between Main and the bed and walks toward the door . " Please , " he says , " I 'll see you in the office . Go on home , Mr. Main , get some sleep . " He opens the door for him . " What ? " " It 's pretty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hook ? " " I think so . " " Out of the woods ? " " That 's the chance I 'm taking . " " And you 'll see me in the office . " " Yes . " " In the morning . " " Yes , sir . " The Phoenician smiles wearily . " You let me talk myself out , do your stalling for you . " " You 're a reasonable man , Mr. Main . You 're a reasonable man , Alex . "  | " Oyp and Glyp are dead . " " Well , as you say , who can know what happened ? I 'm glad you closed the books on them . It was time . " " That 's right . " " You had a perfect record otherwise . " " Sure . " " They do n't change that . " " No . " " Do you want me to call a taxi for you ? " " Do you think they 're really dead ? I mean , I 've got no actual proof @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know those two . If they were alive we 'd probably have heard something . We were bound to . Leopards do n't change their spots . " " I guess . " He raises his pistol and aims it at Crainpool 's hand which is still on the door . " There was always someone to hunt , " he says . " A mystery I was good at . My line of country . But if Oyp and Glyp are dead  --  " " Come on , Mr. Main , do n't  --  " He fires and the bullet chips the knuckles of Crainpool 's hand . Astonished , the clerk raises the hand to his mouth and stares wild-eyed at the Phoenician . The blood makes it appear that he has been eating cherry pie . " Run , " the Phoenician commands , hisses . " Run , you bastard . " " What ? " " Run . Down the stairway . Run , run . " " What are you doing ? " He raises the pistol again , and Crainpool turns and flees . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the long line of rooms . Oddly they give the hallway the appearance of stalled traffic . Old women stand before them in nightgowns , their hands at their hearts . The Phoenician can just make out Crainpool'sback as he shoves open the door to the emergency stairway . " OYP , " he shouts , " AND GLYP , " he shouts , " ARE DEAD , " he shouts . He starts after the clerk in his old man 's gravid trot . " LONG , " he roars , " LIVE CRAINPOOL ! " He hurries to the stairwell through the door that Crainpoolp126has just moved through . He is panting ; the hand that holds the pistol shakes . He leans over the railing and sees a blur of Crainpoolas the younger , faster man reaches the bottom stair . He points the pistol downward and fires without looking . Ah , he 's missed . Good . He puts the gun in his jacket and walks lazily down the stairs . He enters the lobby and , feigning breathlessness , calls to the night clerk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see him ? " " What the hell 's happening ? " " Did you see him ? " He taps his pocket . " I 've got a warrant for his arrest . Did you see which way he went ? " The clerk shakes his head . " He went out . I do n't know . He went out . He was bleeding , " he says . " His hand was all blood , his mouth . " " Yeah , he was too fast for me . I missed . I catch him I 'm going to fuck all over him . " He goes through the revolving doors and out into the street . The air is lovely . He looks left and right . Which way , he wonders . North ? To the suburbs ? East towards the railroad tracks ? Or did he double back ? Head downtown maybe ? To the street where he himself had walked that afternoon ? Where the people were more like film stars than the film stars were , as everybody was these days , handsomeness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bedsprings in the Cincinnati trees ?  |p127The  Making Of Ashendenp129I 'VE BEEN spared a lot , one of the blessed of the earth , at least one of its lucky , that privileged handful of the dramaticallyprospering , the sort whose secrets are asked , like the hundred-year-old man . There is no secret , of course ; most of what happens to us is simple accident . Highish birth and a smooth network of appropriate connection like a tea service written into the will . But surely something in the blood too , locked into good fortune 's dominant genes like a blast ripening in a time bomb . Set to go off , my good looks and intelligence , yet exceptional still , take away my mouthful of silver spoon and lapful of luxury . Something my own , not passed on or handed down , something seized , wrested  --  my good character , hopefully , my taste perhaps . ' What 's mine , what 's mine ? Say taste  --  the soul 's harmless appetite . I 've money , I 'm rich . The heir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Newpert . The family held some good real estate in Rhode Island until they sold it for many times what they gave for it . Grandmother on Father 's side was a Salts , whose bottled mineral water , once available only through prescriptionand believed indispensable in the cure of all fevers , was the first product ever to be reviewed by the Food and Drug Administration , a famous and controversial case . The governmentfound it to contain nothing that was actually detrimental to human beings , and it went public , so to speak . Available now over the counter , the Salts made more money from it than ever . Mother was an Oh . Her mother was the chemical engineer who first discovered a feasible way to store oxygen in tanks . And Father was Noel Ashenden , who though he did not actually in/vent the matchbook , went into the field when it was still a not very flourishing novelty , and whose slogan , almost a poem , " Close Cover Before Striking " ( a simple stroke , as Father liked to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it ( the Patent Office refused to issue a patent on what it claimed was merely an instruction , but Father 's company had the message on its matchbooks before his competitors even knew what was happening ) , removed the hazard from book matches and turned the industry and Father 's firm particularly into a flaming success overnight  --  Father 's joke , not mine . Later , when the inroads of Ronson and Zippo threatened the business , Father went into seclusionfor six months and when he returned to us he had producedanother slogan : " For Our Matchless Friends . " It saved the industry a second time and was the second and last piece of work in Father 's life . There are people who gather in the spas and watering places of this world who pooh-pooh our fortune . Apres ski , cozy in their wools , handsome before their open hearths , they scandalize amongst themselves in whispers . " Imagine , " they say , " saved from ruin because of some cornball sentiment available in every bar and grill and truck stop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Not what ? Snobs ! Phooey on the First Families . On railroad , steel mill , automotive , public utility , banking and shipping fortunes , on all hermetic legacy , morganatic and blockbuster bloodlinesthat change the maps and landscapes and alter the mobility patterns , your jungle wheeling and downtown dealing a stone 's throw from warfare . I come of good stock  --  real estate , mineral water , oxygen , matchbooks : earth , water , air and fire , the old elementals of the material universe , a bellybutton economics , a linchpin one . It is as I see it a perfect genealogy , and if I can be bought and sold a hundred times over by a thousand men in this country  --  people in your own town could do it , providents and trailers of hunch , I bless them , who got into this or went into that when it was eight cents a share  --  I am satisfied with my thirteen or fourteen million . Wealth is not after all the point . The genealogy is . That bridge-trick nexus that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Oh , love 's lucky longshots which , paying off , permitted me as they permit every human life !

And why not ? Are n't my circumstances superb ? Whose are better ? No boast , no boast . I 've had it easy , served up on all life 's silver platters like a satrap . And if my money is managed for me and I do no work  --  less work even than Father , who at least came up with those two slogans , the latter in a six-month solitude that must have been hell for that gregarious man ( " For Our Matchless Friends " : no slogan finally but a broken code , an extension of his own hospitablebeing , simply the Promethean gift of fire to a guest )  --  at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me still alive the nerve endings of gratitude . If it 's miserly to count one 's blessings , Brewster Ashenden 's a miser . This will give you some idea of what I 'm like : On Having an Account in a Swiss Bank : I never had one , and suggest you stay away from them too . Oh , the mystery and romance is all very well , but never forget that your Swiss bank offers no premiums , whereas for opening a savings account for $5,000 or more at First National City Bank of New York or other fine institutions you get wonderful premiums  --  picnic hampers , Scotch coolers , Polaroid cameras , Hudson 's Bay blanketsfrom L. L. Bean , electric shavers , even lawn furniture . My managers always leave me a million or so to play with , and this is how I do it . I suppose I 've received hundreds of such bonuses . Usually I give them to friends or as gifts at Christmas to doormen and other loosely connected personnel of the household , but often I keep them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Of course I can afford to buy any of these things  --  and I do , I enjoy making purchases  --  but somehow nothing brings the joy of existence home to me more than these premiums . Something from nothing  --  the two-suiter from Chase Manhattan and my own existence , luggage a bonus and life a bonus too . Like havingp132a film star next to you on your flight from the Coast . There are treats of high order , adventure like cash in the street . Let 's enjoy ourselves , I say ; let 's have fun . Lord , let us live in the sand by the surf of the sea and play till cows come home . We 'll have a house on the Vineyard and a brownstone in the Seventies and a pied-a-terre in a world capital when something big is about to break . ( Put the Cardinal in the back bedroom where the sun gilds the bay at afternoon tea and give us the courage to stand up to secret police at the door , to top all threats with threats of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fast comeback at the front stairs , authority on us like the funny squiggle the counterfeiters miss . ) Re-Columbus us . Engage us with the overlooked , a knowledge of optics , say , or a gift for the tides . ( My pal , the heir to most of the vegetablesin inland Nebraska , has become a superb amateur oceanographer . The marine studies people invite him to Wood 's Hole each year . He has a wave named for him . ) Make us good at things , the countertenor and the German language , and teach us to be as easy in our amateur standing as the best man at a roommate 's wedding . Give us hard tummies behind the cummerbundand long swimmer 's muscles under the hound 's tooth so that we may enjoy our long life . And may all our stocks rise to the occasion of our best possibilities , and our humanness be bullish too . Speaking personally I am glad to be a heroic man . I am pleased that I am attractive to women but grateful I 'm no bounder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love with me , as frequently they do , I am rarely to blame . I never encourage these fits and do my best to get them over their derangements so as not to lose the friendships of their husbands when they are known to me , or the neutral friendship of the ladies themselves . This happens less than you might think , however , for whenever I am a houseguest of a married friend I usually make it a point to bring along a girl . These girls are from all walks of life  --  models , show girls , starlets , actresses , tennis professionals , singers , heiresses and the daughters of the diplomats of most of the nations of the free world . All walks.  |p133They  tend , however , to conform to a single physical type , and are almost always tall , tan , slender and blond , the girl from Ipanemaas a wag friend of mine has it . They are always sensitive and intelligent and good at sailing and the Australian crawl . They are never blemished in any way , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a thigh or above the shoulderblade is enough to put me off , and their breaths must be as sweet at three in the morning as they are at noon . ( I never see a woman who is dieting for diet sours the breath . ) Arm hair , of course , is repellent to me though a soft blond down is now and then acceptable . I know I sound a prig . I 'm not . I am  --  well , classical , drawn by perfection as to some magnetic , Platonic pole , idealism and beauty 's true North . But if I 'm demanding about the type I fall in love with  --  I do fall in love , I 'm not Don Juan  --  I try to be charming to all women , the flawed as well as the unflawed . I know that times have changed and that less is expected of gentlemen these days , that there 's more " openness " between the sexes and that in the main , this is a healthy development . Still , in certain respects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it  --  and not only find myself incapable of strong language in the presence of a lady ( I rarely use it myself at any time , even a " damn " even a " hell " ) but become enraged when someone else uses it and immediately want to call him out . I 'm the same if there 's a child about or a man over the age of fifty-seven if he is not vigorous . The leopard can not change his spots . I 'm a gentleman , an opener of doors and doffer of hats and after you firster , meek in the elevator and kind to the help . I maintain a fund which I use for the abortions of girls other men have gotten into trouble ; if the young lady prefers , I have a heart-to-heart with the young man . And although I 've no sisters , I have a brother 's temperament , all good counsel and real concern . Even without a sister of my own  --  or a brother either for that matter ; I 'm an only child  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sisses the moral forks . Still , there 's fun in me , and danger too . I 'm this orphan now but that 's recent ( Father and Mother died early this year , Mother first and Father a few days later  --  Father , too , was courteous top134women ) , and I 'm afraid that when they were alive I gave my parents some grisly moments with my exploits , put their hearts in their mouths and gray in their hair . I have been a fighter pilot for the RAF ( I saw some action at Suez ) and a mercenary on the Biaf ran side , as well as a sort of free-lance spy against some of your South American and Greek juntas . ( I 'm not political , but the average generalissimo cheats at cards . It 's curious , I 've noticed that though they steal the picture cards they rarely play them ; I suppose it 's a class thing  --  your military man would rather beat you with a nine than a king . ) I am Johnny-on-thespotat disasters  --  I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pulling my oar , the sort of man who knocks your teeth out if he catches you abusing the water ration in the lifeboat and then turns around and offers his own meager mouthful to a woman or a man over fifty-seven . Chavez is my friend and the Chicago Seven , though I had to stop seeing them because of the foul language . ( I love Jerry Rubin too much to tear his head off , and I could see that 's what it would come to . ) And here and there I 've had Mafiosi for friends  --  wonderful family men , the Cosa Nostra , I respect that . And the astronauts , of course ; I spent a weightless weekend with them in an anti-gravity chamber in Houston one time , coming down only to take a long-distance phone call from a girl in trouble . And , let 's see , sixty hours in the bathysphere with Cousteau , fathoms below where the ordinary fish run . So I have been weightless and I have been gravid , falling in free-fall like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And in the Prix de this and Prix de t' other , all the classic combats of moving parts ( my own moving parts loose as a toy yet to be assembled ) , uninsurable at last , taking a stunt man 's risks , a darer gone first , blinded in the world 's uncharted caves and deafened beneath its waterfalls , the earth itself a sort of Jungle Gym finally , my playground , swimming at your own risk . Last winter I fought a duel . I saw a man whipping his dog and called him out . Pistols at fourteen paces . The fellow  --  a prince , a wastrel  --  could get no one to act as his second so I did it myself , giving him pointers , calling the adjustments for windage , and at last standing still for him as one of those FBI paper silhouettes ,  |p135my  vitals ( we were on a beach , I wore no shirt , just my bathing suit , the sun , rising over his shoulder , spotlighting me ) clear as marked meat on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barrel of his pistol . He fired and missed and I threw my pistol into the sea . He wept , and I took him back to the house and gave him a good price for his dog . And running with the bulls at Pamplona  --  not in front of them , with them  --  and strolling at two a.m. through the Casbah like a fellow down Main Street , and standing on top of a patrol car in Harlem talkingthrough the bull horn to the sniper . And dumb things too . Father called me home from Tel Aviv a few weeks before he died . He was sitting on a new bed in his room wearing only his pajama tops . He had n't shaved , the gray stubble latticing his lower face in an old man 's way , like some snood of mortality . There was a glass in his hand , his one-hundred-dollar bill rolled tight around the condensation . ( He always fingered one , a tic . ) " Say hello to your mother . " I had n't seen her . Like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Father and Mother slept in separate suites , but now twin beds , Father in one , Mother in the other , had replacedFather 's fourposter . A nightstand stood between them  --  I remembered it from Grandmother Newpert 's summer house in Edgarton  --  on which , arranged like two entrenched armies , were two sets of medicines , Father 's bright ceremonial pills and May Day capsules , and Mother 's liquids in their antique apothecarybottles ( she supplied the druggist with these bottles herself , insisting out of her willful aesthetic sense that all her prescriptionsbe placed in them ) , with their water glasses and a shiny artillery of teaspoons . Mother herself seemed to be sleeping . Perhaps that 's why I had n't noticed her , or perhaps it was the angle , Father 's bed being the closer as I walked into the room . Or perhaps it was her condition itself , sickness an effacement . I hesitated . " It 's all right , " Father said . " She 's awake . You 're not disturbingher. "  | " Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I have been seeing double in the morning , Brewster darling , " Mother said . " It gives me megrim to open them . " " Mother , you naughty slugabed , " I teased . Sometimes being a gentleman can be a pain in the you-know-where , to oneself as well as to others . Well , it 's often fatuous , and in emergency it always is , as anything is in emergency short of an uncivilized scream , but what can you do , a code is a code . One dresses for dinner in the jungle and surrenders one 's sword to the enemy and says thank you very much and refuses the blindfold . " Shame on you , sweetheart , the sun up these several hours and you still tucked in . " " It 's cancer , Son , " Father said in a low tone not meant for Mother . " Lazybones , " I scolded , swallowing hard . " Oh , I do want to see you , Brewster , " Mother said . " Perhaps if I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all , you sweet dear . If you must lie in bed all day I think it best that you do some honest sleeping . I 'll still be here when you finally decide to get up . " " There , that 's better , " Mother said , opening her right eye and scowling at me . " Please , honeybunch , you 'll see double and get megrim . " " Brewster , it 's lovely . It makes you twice as handsome , twice as tall . " " Please , Mother  --  " " Let her , Brew . This is a deathbed . " " Father ! " " Why are you so shocked , Brewster ? It had to happen some-day . " " I think I 'll close it now . " " Really , Father , a deathbed ... " " Since it upsets him so . " " Well , deathbeds then . " " But I reserve the right to open it again whenever I choose . If a cat can look at a king ... " " Father , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , shut it , shut it tight  --  the slightest bit melodramatic ? "  | " Oh , for Lord 's sake , Brew , do n't be prissy . Mother and I are going , she of cancer , I of everything . Rather than waste the little time we have left together , we might try to get certain things straight . " " When Father called you back from overseas he arranged with Mrs. Lucas to have these twin deathbeds set up in here . " Mrs. Lucas is the housekeeper . She used to give me my baths when I was a child . I always try to remember to bring her a picnic hamper or some other especially nice premium from the bank when I come home for a visit . Over the years Mrs. Lucas has had chaises longues , card tables , hammocks and many powerful flashlights from me  --  a small fortune in merchandise . " What were you doing in the Middle East in the first place ? Those people are n't your sort , Brew . " " He did it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both deathbeds in the same room you would n't have to shuffle back and forth between one chamber and the next . It 's a time-space thing , Noel said .

" " Arabs , Jews . In my time a country club was a country club . I do n't understand anything anymore . " " Do n't quarrel , Noel , Brew . Brew , you 're the reason we decided to have deathbeds in the first place . Well , my family has always had them , of course . None of this hole-and-corner hospital stuff for them .

" " Brr . " " Are you addressing me , Father ? " " What ? No , no , I have a chill . " " Let me help you . " I lifted his legs into the bed gently , tookp138the glass out of his hand and set it down , unpeeling the $ i oo bill as if it were a beer label . I placed his head back on the pillow and , smoothing the sheets , started to cover him when he grinned . " Close cover before striking , " he said hoarsely . That broke the ice and we all laughed . " Nothing important ever gets said in a hospital , " Father said after a while . " There 's too much distraction . The room , the gadgets , the flowers and who sent what , the nurses coming in for one thing or another . Nothing important gets said . " I nodded . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been a tradition in our family . This twin bed business is a little vulgar , perhaps , but it ca n't be helped . We 'll have a deathbed vigil . It 's a leisure thing . It 's elegant . " " Please , Father , let 's not have any more of this morbid stuff about dying , " I said , getting the upper hand obi myself . " It 's my notion you 're both goldbricking , that you 'll be out on the links again in no time , your handicap lower than ever . " " It 's heart , Brew , " Father said gloomily . " It 's Meniere 's disease . It 's TB and a touch of MS that hangs on like a summer cold . It 's a spot of Black Lung . " " Black Lung ? " " Do you know how many matches I 've struck in my time ? " " I would n't be surprised , Father , if there were another slogan in you yet . I Would Rather Light an Ashenden Match @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Too literary .

" " There 's this Israeli ace , " I said as a stopgap , " Izzy Heskovitz , who 's ... " " What 's this about a duel , Brewster ? " Father asked . " Oh , did you hear about that ? I should have thought thePrince would have wanted it hushed up , after what happened . " " After what happened ? He thinks you 're mad . And so do I.Exposing yourself like that , offering a target like a statesman inp139an open car , then tossing your pistol into the sea . It was irresponsible . Were you trying to kill yourself ?

" " Brewster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still looking for himself , " Father said . " As a man who has a certainexperience with slogans , I have some sense of when they have lost their currency . " " Father , you are probably the last old man in America to take to a deathbed . " " Touche , Brew . He 's got you there , Noel , " Mother said . " Thank you , Mother , but all I intended was to point out that obsolescence runs in our family . I am the earth , water , fire and air heir . Let the neon , tin and tungsten scions prepare themselves for the newfangled . I have pride and I have honor . My word is my bond and I 'll marry a virgin . And I agree with you , Father , about the sanctity of the deathbed , though I shall continue , out of chivalry and delicacy , to maintain the imposture that this .. . these "  --  I took in the twin beds  --  " is . . . are . . . not that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brewster .

She had opened one eye again . It was wet and darting from one side to the other like an eye in REM sleep . I understood that she was trying to choose my real image from the two that stood before her . In a moment her eye had decided . It stared off , focused about four yards to my right . I smiled to reassure her that she had chosen correctly and edged slowly to my right , an Indian in reverse , unhiding , trying to appear in her line of sight like a magician 's volunteer in an illusion . " And all I have to say top140you , you great silly , is that if you 're not out of bed soon I 'll not answer for your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me up the drive that Franklin , as usual , has managed to make a botch of the front beds . " " Franklin is old , Son , " Mother said . " He is n't well . " " Franklin 's a rogue , Mother . I do n't know why you encourage him . I 'm certain he 's going to try to trade Mrs. Lucas the three hundred feet of lovely rubber garden hose I brought him for her Scotch cooler so that he can have a place to hide his liquor . " Mother closed her eye ; Father grinned . I wrung out Father 's hundred-dollar bill and handed it back to him . Excusing myself , I promised to return when they had rested . " Brr , " Father said . " Were you speaking to me , Father ? " " It 's the chill again , " he said . I went to my room , called up their doctors and had long , discouragingtalks with them . Then I phoned some specialist friends of mine at Mass General and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ additional opinions . I asked about Franklin , too . I kept the vigil . It was awful , but satisfying , too , in a way . It lasted five weeks and in that time we had truth and we had banter , and right up to the end each of us was able to tell the difference . Only once , a few days after Mother 's death ( her vision returned at the end : " I can see , Brewster , " she said , " I can see far and I can see straight . " These were not her last words ; I 'll not tell you her last words , for they were meant only for Father and myself , though I have written them down elsewhere to preserve for my children should I ever have them ) did Father 's spirits flag . He had gotten up from his bed to attend the funeral  --  through a signal courtesy to an out-of-stater , the Governor of Massachusetts permitted Mother to be buried on Copp 's Hill Burying Ground near the Old North Church @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house . Mrs. Lucas and Franklin were weeping , and I helped Father upstairs and back into his deathbed . He was too weak to put his pajamas on . " You know , Brew , " he said , " I sure wish you had n't thrown that d d pistol into the ocean . " " Oh Father , " I said , " never mind . Tomorrow when you'rep141stronger we 'll go to town and buy a fresh brace and stroll the woods and shoot the birds from their trees just as we used to . " He was dead in his own tree a few days later . I sensed it coming and had moved into the room with him , where I lay next to him all night in the twin bed , only Grandmother Newpert'snightstand between us , Mother 's effects  --  the lovely old apothecary bottles and her drinking glass and medicine spoons  --  having been cleared away . I was awake the entire night , hanging on his broken breath and old man 's groans like a detective in films on the croaks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the coma and tried to parse delirium as if it were only a sort of French . Shall a man of honor and pride still searching for himself in his late thirties deny the sibyl in a goner 's gasps ? ( I even asked one or two questions , pressing him in his terminal pain , pursuing him through the mazes of his dissolution , his deathbedmy Ouija board . ) Then , once , just before dawn , a bird twittered in the garden and Father came out of it . For fifteen minutes he talked sense , speaking rapidly and with an astonishing cogency that was more mysterious somehow than all his moans and nightmares . He spoke of ways to expedite the probating of the two wills , of flaws in the nature of his estate , instructing me where to consolidate and where to trim . He told me the names of what lawyers to trust , which brokers to fire . In five minutes he laid down principles which would guarantee our fortune for a hundred years . Then , at the end , there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I thought it a touch lame , like a P.S. inquiring about your family 's health at the end of a business letter . He wished me well and hoped I would find some nice girl , settle down , and raise fine children . I was to give them his love . I thought this was the end , but in a few moments he came round again . " Franklin is a rogue , " he said . " For many years now he and Mrs. Lucas have been carrying on an affair below stairs . That time during the war when Mrs. Lucas was supposed to have gone to stay with her sister in Delaware she really went away to have Franklin 's child . The scoundrel refused to marry her and wouldp142have had money from us to abort the poor thing . It was Mrs. Lucas who would n't hear of it , but the baby died anyway . Mrs. Lucas loves him . It 's for her sake we never let him go when he screwed up in the garden . " Those were Father 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my bed and approach him . He put out his right hand . I shook it and he died . The hundred-dollar bill he always held came off in my palm when the final paroxysm splayed his fingers . The grief of the rich is clubby , expensive . ( I do n't mean my grief . My grief was a long gloom , persistent as grudge . ) We are born weekenders anyway , but in death we are particularly good to each other , traveling thousands of miles to funerals , flying up from Rio or jamming the oceanic cables with our expensiveconsolation . ( Those wires from the President to the important bereaved  --  that 's our style , too . ) We say it with flowers , wreaths , memorial libraries , offering the wing of a hospitalas casually as someone else a chicken leg at a picnic . And why not ? There are n't that many of us  --  never mind that there are a thousand who can buy and sell me . Scarcer we are than the Eskimaux , vanishing Americans who got rich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who turned up at Mother 's funeral and then went away the long distances only to return a few days later for Father 's . Or at the clothes . Couturiers of Paris and London and New York  --  those three splendid cities , listed always together and making a sound on the page like a label on scent  --  taxed to the breaking point to come up with dresses in death 's delicious high fashion , the rich taking big casualties that season , two new mourning originals in less than two weeks and the fitter in fits . The men splendid in their decent dark . Suits cunnngly not black , off black , proper , the longitudes of their decency in their wiry pinstripes , a gent 's torso bound up in vest and crisscrossed by watch chains and Phi Beta Kappa keys in the innocent Para-militarism of the civilian respectable , men somehow more vital at the graveside in the burdensome clothes than in Bermudas on beaches or dinner jackets in hotel suites with cocktails in their hands , the band playing on the beach below and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gorgeous , grieving 's colors good for them , aloof mantles which made them seem ( though I knew better ) unattainable , virgins again , yet sexy still as secret drinkers . God , how I lusted when I was with them ! I could barely put two words together for them or accept their condolenceswithout feeling my importunate , inopportune blood thicken , my senses as ticklish as if Persian whores had gotten to them . Which added to my gloom , of course , because I was dishonoringmy parents in their death as I never had while they lived . Only the necessity to cope saved me from some sacrilege . ( Oh , the confidence of lust ! Surely that 's the basis of its evil . The assumptions it permits one , glossing reality like a boy in the dark , touching himself and thinking of his mother 's bridge guests . ) Somehow , however , I managed to see my tailor , somehow got the arrangements made , somehow wrote the necessary checks and visited the near-at-hand safe-deposit boxes before they were redflagged , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people at the Times , prepared the eulogies somehow , and fielded all the questions of the well-meaning that are asked at times like these . " Will there be a foundation , do you suppose , Ashenden ? " asked an old friend of the family who had himself been an heir for as long as we had known him . ( And oh , the effect of that " Ashenden " ! It was the first time one had been thus addressed , at least officially , since one 's roommates at boarding school and college , thinking of their own inheritances , had used it . ) " I do n't know , sir . It 's too early to tell . I shall have to wait until the estate is properly probated before I can be certain what there is . " " Of course , of course , " he said , " but it 's never too soon to start thinking about a foundation , fixing your goals . " " Yes , sir . " " Let me give you a little advice on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swear by diseases and the various social ills , but I 'm not one of them . And of the arts I think the performing arts give you your best return . You get invited backstage . "  | " I 'll have to look into it . " " Look into it . " And one of Mother 's friends wondered if marriage was in the offing . " Now you really are eligible , Brewster , " she said . " Oh , you were before , of course , but now you must certainly feel a bit of pressure to put your affairs in order and began to think about the next generation . " It was a rude thing to say ( though something like these had been almost Father 's last words to me ) , but the truth was I did feel it . Perhaps that was what my shameful lust had been about , nature 's way of pointing me to my duty . My search for myself seemed trivial child 's play now . Honor did subsist in doing right by the generations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this impostor , this namby with no will of his own ? If he 's so rich , why ai n't he smart ? Meaning glacial , indifferent , unconscious of the swath of world he cuts as the blade of what it leaves bleeding  --  the cosmos as rich man 's butter pat . Listen , disdain 's easy , a mug 's game , but look close at anything and you 'll break your heart . I was inconsolable , grave at the graveside , beside myself like a fulfillment of Mother 's prophetic double vision . " People lose parents , " a Securities and Exchange Commission cousin told me . ( Yes , yes , it 's nothing , only nature bottoming out . ) " Sons lose mothers , " he said , his gray hair trimmed that morning , wet looking . " Fathers die . " " Do n't look , " I said wildly , " shut an eye . I am beside myself . " I keened like a widow , a refugee from hardest times , a daughter with the Cossacks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go about in black , I thought , and be superstitious . My features will thicken and no one will know how old I am . " There , there , " he told me , " there , there . " " There , there . There , there , " said this one and that . My pals did not know what to make of me . " My God , Ashenden , " one said , a roommate from boarding school , " have you seen the will ? Is it awful ? " " I 've been left everything , " I told him coolly . He nudged me in the ribs . I would have called him out had I not been in mourning.  |p145Only  the sight of Mrs. Lucas saved me . The thought of that brave woman 's travail enabled me to control myself at last . I no longer wept openly and settled into a silent , stand-offish grimness , despair like an ingrown toenail on a man of fashion . The weekends began . All my adult life I have been a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and seasons like a migratory bird , an instinct in me , the rich man 's cunning feel for ripeness , some **25;14656;TOOLONG working there which knows without reference to anything outside itself when to pack the tennis racket , when to bring along the German field glasses to look at a friend 's birds , the telescope to stare at his stars , the wet suit to swim in beneath his waters when the exotic fish are running . It 's not in the Times when the black dinner jacket comes off and the white one goes on ; it 's something surer , subtler , the delicate guidance system of the privileged , my playboy astronomy . The weekends began , and the midweeks and week- and twoweekstretches in the country . I was very grateful to my friends ' sense of what I needed then . Where I was welcome before , I was now actively pursued . My friends were marvelous , and not a mean motive between them . If I ca n't say as much for myself . In the luggage now with the bandboxes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hiker 's gear , was a lover 's wardrobe : shirts like the breasts of birds , custom ties that camouflaged themselves against their backgrounds or stood out like dye in the sea , ascots like bunting for the throat 's centennial , the handmade jackets and perfect trousers and tack room leathers . I dressed to kill , slay should I meet her , the mother of my children . ( These were my mourning togs , mind . ) And if I brought the best that could be had , it was not out of vanity but only respect for that phantom girl who would be so exquisite herself , so refined and blessed with taste that it would have been as dangerous for her to look at the undistinguished as for another to stare directly into the eclipse . So it was actually humility that made me dress as I did , simple self-effacement , the old knight 's old modesty , shyness so capitulative that prostration was only a kind of militant attention , a death-defying leap to the earth . And since I had never met @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clue to where she might be , Ip146traveled alone , for the first time taking along no guest of the guest . Which my friends put down to decency , the thirty- or sixty- or ninety-day celibacy of the orphaned . But it was n't that . It was a strange period of my life . My friends , innocent of my intentions and honoring what they supposed to be my bereavement , omitted to invite any girls for me at all , and I found myself on this odd bachelor circuit , several times meeting the same male guest I had met at someone else 's house a few weeks before . We crossed each other 's paths like traveling salesmen with identical territories . And I rode and hunted and fished and stayed up all hours playing whist or backgammon or chess with my hosts or the other male guest , settled before fires with sherry and cognac , oddly domestic , as if what I owed the generations was a debt already paid , a trip in the time machine , keeping late hours in libraries until the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the few occasions I retired early it was at my host 's instructions . ( I am an obedient guest . ) The next morning there was to be an excursion in the four-wheel drive to investigate property he had acquired in backwoods forty miles off  --  a lodge , an abandoned watchtower , twice an old lighthouse . And always , nodding my approval if the purchase had been made or giving my judicious advice if it had n't , I had this sense that I 'd had the night before in the library : that the property in question was my property , that I was already what I was dressed to become . I was not bored ; I was distraught . A strange thing happened . It occurred to me that perhaps my old fastidiousness regarding the inviolability of a friend 's wife was wrong , morally wrong . Had not these women made overtures , dropped hints , left doors ajar so that returning to my room with a book I could see them in nightgowns beside bedlamps ; had n't they smiled sweetly and raised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ placed too high a value on myself by insisting on the virginity of my intended . Perhaps it was my fate to figure in a divorce . I decided that henceforth I must not be so stand-offish with my friends ' wives . So I stroked their knees beneath the whist table and put down their alarm to surprise . I begged off going on the excursions and stayed home with them when my friend and the other guestp147climbed into the jeep . I followed the wife all about the house and cornered her in stairwells and gardens . " I 'm no prig , " I told Nan Bridge , and clasped her breast and bit her ear . " What the hell do you think you 're doing , buster ? " she shouted . " Four months ago I would have called you out for that , " I told her lamely and left her house that afternoon and went to the next three days early , determined to be more careful . I was staying with Courtney and Buffy Surface in Connecticut . Claiming a tennis elbow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first set . Courtney and I were partners against Buffy and Oscar Bobrinage , the other houseguest . My plan was for Buffy to drop out and join me . I sat under a wide umbrella in the garden , and in a few minutes someone came up behind me . " Where does it hurt ? I 'll rub it for you . " " No thank you , Oscar . " " No trouble , Brewster . " " I 've a heating pad from Chase Manhattan in my suitcase , Osc , " I told him dejectedly . That night I was more obvious . I left the library and mentioned as casually as I could that I was going out for a bit of air . It has been my observation that the predisposition for encounter precedesencounter , that one must set oneself as one would a table . I never stroll the strand in moonlight except when I 'm about the heart 's business , or cross bridges toward dawn unless I mean to save the suicides . There are natural laws , magnetism . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the colors of the flowers in the dark , the queer consolidation of noon 's bright pigment , yellow sunk in on yellow a thousand times as if struck by gravity . I thought of popular songs , their tunes and words . I meant for once to do away with polite conversation should Buffy appear , to stun her with my need and force . ( Of all my friends Buffy was the most royally aloof . She had maddening ways of turning aside any question or statement that was the least bit threatening . ) I heard the soft crunch of gravel . " Oscar ? "  | " No , it 's Buffy . Were you loking for Oscar ? " " I thought he might be looking for me . " " Voila du joli , " Buffy said . She knew the idioms of eleven modern languages . I gazed into her eyes . " How are you and Courtney , Buffy ? " " Mon dieu ! zQue pasa ? Il est onze heures et demi , " she said . " Buffy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been off erythromycin five days now and General Parker says there 's no sign of redness . God bless wonder drugs . Darauf kannst du Gift nehmen . " " Do you ever think of Madrid , Buffy ? " Once , in a night club in Madrid on New Year 's Eve she had kissed me . It was before she and Courtney met , but my memory of such things is long lasting and profound . I never forget the blandest intimacy . " Do you ? " " Oh , Brewster , I have every hope that when Juan Carlos is restored the people will accept him . " " Buffy , we kissed each other on New Year 's Eve in Madrid in 1966 before you ever heard of Courtney Surface . " " Autres temps , autres moeurs . " " I ca n't accept that , Buff . Forgive me , dear , but when I left the game this morning you stayed behind to finish out the set against Courtney . Yes , and before that you were Oscar 's partner . Does n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and your husband ? " " Oh , but darling , we play for money . Pisica bldnda pgarie rail . Did n't you know that ? We earn each other 's birthday presents . We 've an agreement : we do n't buy a gift unless we win the money for it from the other fellow . I 'll tell you something , entre nous . I get ripped off because I throw games . I do . I take dives . I go into the tank . Damit kannst du keinen Blumentopf verlieren . Is n't that awful ? Are n't I terrible ? But that 's how Courtney got the money together to buy me Nancy 's Treehouse . Have you seen her ? She 's the most marvelous beast . I was just going out to the stables to check on her when I ran into you . If you 'd like to accompany me come along lo ma 's pronto posible . " " No. "  | " De gustibus . " " That 's not a modern language , Buffy . " " People grow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I demand that you listen to me . I am almost forty years old and I am one of the three or four dozen truly civilized men in the world and I have been left a fortune . A fortune ! And though I have always had the use of the money , I have never till now had the control of it . Up to now I have been an adventurer . The adventures , God save me , were meant to teach me life . Danger builds strong bodies twelve ways , I thought . Action and respite have been the pattern of my existence , Buffy . Through shot and shell on hands and knees one day , and breakfast in bed at the Claridge the next . I have lived my life a fighter pilot , beefed up like a gladiator , like a stuffed goose , like a Thanksgiving turkey . I am this civilized .. . thing . Trained and skilled and good . I mean good , Buffy , a strict observer till night before last of every commandment there is . Plus an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've done that . I 'm versed in it , up to my ears in it as you are in idioms . I was an environmentalist a decade before it was an issue . When I first noticed the deer were scrawnier than they 'd been when I was a boy and the water in the rivers where I swam no longer tasted like peaches . " I 've been a scholar of the world  --  oh , an amateur , I grant you , but a scholar just the same . I understand things . I know literature and math and science and art . I know everything . How paper is made , glass blown , marble carved , things about furniture , stuff about cheese . This is n't a boast . With forty years to do it in and nothing to distract you like earning a living or raising a family , you can learn almost all there is to learn if you leave out the mystery and the ambiguity . If you omit the riddles and finesse the existential . " No , wait ! I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tree  --  do you have that idiom , my dear ?  --  but looky , looky , I 'm speaking my heart . I 'm in mourning , Buff . Here 's how I do it . By changing my life . By taking this precious , solipsistic civilization of mine  --  Buffy , listen to me , dear ; it 's not enoughp150that there are only three or four dozen truly civilized men in theworld  --  this precious civilization of mine and passing it on to sons , daughters , all I can get . " " Was ist los ? " she said miserably . " Time and tide . " " Pauvre garcon . " " Buffy , pauvre garcon me no pauvres garcons . " She looked at me for a moment with as much feeling as I had looked at her . " Jane Loes Lipton . " " What ? " " Jane Loes Lipton . A friend of my sister Milly . " " What about her ? " " Ah . " " Ah ? " " She 'll be Comte de Survillieur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " We did a hitch together in the Foreign Legion . " " Go . Pack . I 'll phone Paris . Perhaps Milly can get you an invitation . In bocca al lupo . " I missed her at the Comte de Survillieur 's , and again at Liege , and once more at Cap Therese and the Oktoberfest at Munchen . All Europe was talking about her  --  the fabulous Jane Loes Lipton . One had only to mention her name to elicit one of those round Henry James " Ah 's . " Nor did it surprise me that until the evening in Buffy Surface 's garden I had never heard of her : I had been out of society for three or four months . These things happen quickly , these brush fires of personality , some girl suddenlytaken up and turned into a household word ( if you can call a seventy-room castle a household or " Ah " a word ) . Once or twice I had seen an old woman or even a child given this treatment . Normally I avoided such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was usually predicated on some quirkishness , nothing more substantial than some lisp of the character  --  a commitment to astrology , perhaps , or a knack for mimicry , or skill at bridge . I despise society , but who else will deal with me ? I ca n't run loose in the street with the sailors or drink with the whores . I would put off everyone but a peer.  |p151Still  . . . Jane Loes Lipton . Ah . I had n't met her , but from what I could gather from my peers ' collective inarticulateness when it came to Miss ( that much was established ) Lipton , she was an " authentic , " an " original , " a " beauty , " a " prize . " And it was intriguing , too , how I happened to keep missing her , for once invited to the Comte 's  --  where I behaved ; where , recovering my senses , I no longer coveted my neighbor 's wife and rededicatedmyself to carrying on the good work of my genes and environment in honorable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rich and favored . We were like the Ice Capades , like an old-time circus , occasionally taking on personnel , once in a while dropping someone off  --  a car pool of the heavily leisured . How I happened , as I say , to keep on missing her though we were on the same circuit now , going around  --  no metaphor but a literal description  --  in the same circles  --  and it is too a small world , at our heights , way up there where true North consolidates and collects like fog , it is  --  was uncanny , purest contretemps , a melodrama of bad timing . We were on the same guest lists , often the same floors or wings ( dowagers showed me house plans , duchesses did ; I saw the seating arrangements and croquet combinations ) , co-sponsors of the same charity balls and dinners . Twice it was I who fell out of lockstep and had to stay longer than I expected or leave a few days early , but every other time it was Jane who canceled out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , I wondered ? A Monroeish temperament , some pathological inability to keep appointments , honor commitments ( though always her check for charity arrived , folded in her letter of regret ) , the old high school strategy of playing hard to get ? No . And try to imagine how this struck me , knowingwhat you do about me , when I heard it . " Miss Loes Lipton called to say she will not be able to join your Lordship this weekend due to an emergency outbreak of cholera among the children at the Sisters of Cecilia Mission in Lobos de Afuera . " That was the message the Duke 's secretary brought him at Liege . " She 's Catholic ? " I asked . " What ? Jane ? Good Lord , I should n't think so . " Then , at Cap Therese , I learned that she had again begged off.  |p152I  expressed disappointment and inquired of Mrs. Steppington whether Miss Lipton were ill . " Ah , Jane . Ill ? Jane 's strong as a horse . No , dear boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Jane went there to help the survivors . She 's visiting in hospital with them now . For those of them who have children  --  mostly wogs , I expect  --  she 's volunteered to act as a sort of governess . I can almost see her , going about with a lot of nig-nog kids in tow , teaching them French , telling them the Greek myths , carrying them to whatever museums they have in such places , giving them lectures in art history , then fetching them watercolors  --  and oils too , I should n't doubt  --  so they can have a go at it . Oh , it will be a bore not having her with us . She 's a frightfully good sailor and I had hoped to get her to wear my silks in the regatta . " Though it was two in the morning in Paris , I went to my room and called the Comte de Survillieur . " Comte . Why could n't Jane Loes Lipton make it month beforelast ? " " What 's that ? " The connection was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show up when she was expected at Deux Oiseaux ? " " Who ? " " Jane Loes Lipton . " " Ah . " " Why was n't she there ? " " Who 's this ?

Had to do some special pleading for them in Washington when a bill came up before your Congress . " " HR eleven seventy-four . " " Qu'est-ce que c'est ? " " The bill . Law now . So Jane was into HR eleven seventy-four . " " Ah , what is n't Jane into ? You know , I think she 's becomep153something of a snob ? She has no time for her old friends since undertaking these crusades of hers . She told the Comtesse as much  --  something about finding herself . " " She said that ? " " Well , she was more poetic , possibly , but that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what you 're after , " the Comte said roguishly . " You 're in love with her . " " I 've never even met her . " " You 're in love with her . Half Europe is . But unless you 're a black or redskin , or have arranged in some other way to cripple yourself , you have n't a chance . Arse over tip in love , rnon Cher old comrade . " We rang off . In the following weeks I heard that Jane Loes Lipton had turned up in Hanoi to see if there were n't some way of getting negotiations off dead center ; that she had published a book that broke the code in Oriental rugs ; that she had directed an undergroundmovie in Sweden which despite its frank language and graphic detail was so sensitive it was to be distributed with a G rating ; and that she was back in America visiting outdoor fairs and buying up paintings depicting clowns and rowboats turned over on beaches for a show she was putting together for the Metropolitan entitled " Shopping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " One man said she could be seen in Dacca on Bangladesh Television in a series called " Cooking Nutritious Meals on the Pavement for Large Families from Garbage and Without Fire , " and another that she had becomea sort of spiritual adviser to the statesmen of overdeveloped nations . Newspapers reported her on the scene wherever the earth quaked or the ships foundered or the forests burned . Certainly she could not have had so many avatars . Certainly most was rumor , speculation knit from Jane 's motives and sympathies . Yet I heard people never known to lie , Rock-ofGibraltarishtypes who did n't get the point of jokes , swear to their testimony . Where there 's smoke there 's fire . If most was exaggerated , much was true . Ah , Jane , Candy Striper to the Cosmos , Gray Lady of thep154Ineffable , when would I meet you , swap traveler 's tales of what was to be found in those hot jungles of self-seeking , those voyages to the center of the soul and other uncharted places , the steeps and deeps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Jane , oh Loes Lipton , half Europe loves you . I went to London and stayed in the Bottom , the tall new hotel there . Lonely as Frank Sinatra on an album cover I went up to their revolving cocktail lounge on the fiftieth floor , the Top of the Bottom , and ran into Freddy Plympton . " She 's here . " " Jane Loes Lipton ? I 've heard that one before . " ( We had n't been talking of her . How did I know that 's who he meant ? I do n't know , I knew . ) " No , no , she is , at my country place . She 's there now . She 's exhausted , poor dear , and tells me her doctor has commanded her to resign temporarily from all volunteer fire departments . So she 's here . I 've got her . She 's with Lady Plympton right this moment . I had to come to town on business or I 'd be with her . I 'm going back in the morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " She 's there ? She 's really there ?

" Here 's my room , this is what the stamps in this country look like , that 's the strange color of the sand here , the people all wear these curious hats . " ) Bear with me . Freddy Plympton is noble . The family is old  --  whose is n't , eh ? we were none of us born yesterday ; look it up in Burke 's Peerage where it gets three pages , in Debrett where it gets four  --  and his great estate , Duluth , is one of the finest in England .

Starting from scratch , from choosing odds-or-evens for cash with his roommate at Harrow , a sheikh 's son with a finger missing from his left hand  --  he was left-handed  --  which made him constitutionally unable to play the game ( " He thought even , ' you see , " Freddy explains ) , taking the boy , neither of them more than fourteen , to the cleaners in the third form . It , the young sheikh 's deformity , was Freddy 's initial lesson in what it means to have the house odds in your favor and taught him never to enter any contest in which he did not have the edge . Freddy has one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's my work , old bean , " he says . ( He uses these corny aristocratic epithets . They make him seem fatuous but are as functional to his profession as a drawl to a hired gun . ) " I 'm no gambler at all , actually . I 'm this sort of mathematician . Please do n't gamble with me , please do n't accept my bets . We 're friends and I 'm ruthless . Not vicious  --  ruthless . I will never surrender an advantage . Since I know the odds and respect them , to ignore them would be a sort of cheating , and since I 'm honorable I could n't think of that . Do n't play with me . We 're friends . I was never the sheikh 's friend , never the friend of any of those **31;14683;TOOLONG sons of rich men I lived with at Harrow and Cambridge and who gave me my stake . Where I was meditativethey were speculative . I like you , as I like anyone who does n't confuse his need with his evidence . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So he has a passion , but it is n't gambling . It 's animals  --  beasts , rather . Duluth contains perhaps the most superb private zoo in the world , a huge game park , larger than Whipsnade and much more dangerous . Where Whipsnade hedges with moats and illusions , at Duluth the animals are given absolute freedom . An enormous , camouflaged electrified fence , the largest in the world , runs about the entire estate . ( " We control the current . The jolt merely braces the larger animals and only stuns the smaller , putsp156them unconscious . I 've installed an auxiliary electrical plant for when there are power failures " ) Although from time to time a few of the animals have fought and occasionally killed each other , an attempt has been made to introduce as near perfect an ecological balance as possible , vegetarians and carnivores who find the flesh of the beasts with whom they must live inimical , some almost religious constraint in the jaws and digestion , some once-burned , twice-sorry instinct passed on from generation to generation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ancestor of Plympton 's who began the park , and as a result of the care he and his successors put into selecting and arranging the animals , some of the most incredible and lovely juxtapositions in the world are to be found there . ( Freddy told me that Henri Rousseau painted his " Sleeping Gypsy " while he was a guest on the estate . ) From the beginning a single rule has determined the constituency of the zoo : all the beasts collected there must have appeared on the Plympton heraldry . Lions , bears , elephants , unicorns ( " a pure white rhinoceros actually " ) , leopards , jackals ( " One old boy helped to do in Becket , old boy " ) , pandas , camels , sheep and apes . The family is an old one , the list long . Though Plympton and I had known each other for years  --  we 're the same age  --  this was the first time I had been invited to Duluth . I drove down with him the next morning , and of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was thinking  --  I was not sure I even approved of it  --  but of Jane . I gave myself away with my questions . " She 's ill , you say ? " " Did I ? I thought I said tired . What she told me , anyway . Looks ruddy healthy , in fact . Tanner than I 've ever seen her . " " Is she alone ? " " What , is there a man with her , you mean ? No , no , Ashenden . She 's quite singular . " " How did she happen to drop in on you ? " " I 'm not in it at all , dear chap . I 'm a businessman and gamekeeper . My life 's quite full . I suppose that may actually have had something to do with it , in fact . She called from Heathrow dayp157before yesterday . Said she was in England and wanted someplaceto rest . Lord , I hope she 's not put off by my bringing you down . Never thought of that aspect of it before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No , of course you wo n't , " he said smiling . " Sorry I suggested that . Just thinking out loud . A man concerned with animals must always be conscious of who goes into the cage with whom . It 's a social science , zoology is , very helpful in making up parties . I suppose mine , when I trouble to give them , are among the most gemiitlich in Europe . Indeed , now I think of it , I must have realized as soon as I saw you last night that you 'd be acceptable to Jane , or I 'd never have asked you . Have you known her long ? " " We 've never met . " " What , never met and so keen ? " I smiled lamely and Freddy patted my knee . " I understand . I do . I feel you hoping . And I quite approve . Just do n't confuse your hope with your evidence . " He studied me for a moment . " But then you would n't , would you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " You do understand quite a lot , Freddy . " " Who , me ? I 'm objective , is all . Yearning , I can smell yearninga mile off . " " I shall have to shower . " " Not at all , not at all . It stinks only when untempered by reason . In your case I smell reason a mile off , too . Eminently suitable , eminently , " he pronounced . " I would n't bet against it , " he added seriously , and I felt so good about this last that I had to change the subject . I questioned him about Duluth , which till then I had n't even thought of . Now , almost superstitiously , I refused to think about Jane . Every time he gave me an opening I closed it , choosing , as one does who has so much at stake and success seems within his grasp , to steer clear of the single thing that is of any interest to him . We spoke trivially the whole time , and my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you get to the gallon in this Bentley of yours , Plympton ? " I asked , and even before he could answer I turned to look out the window and exclaim , " Look , look atp158the grass , so green it is . That 's your English climate for you . If rain 's the price a nation must pay to achieve a grass that green , then one must just as well pay up and be still about it . Who 's your tailor ? I 'm thinking of having some things made . " When we left the M-4 and came to the turnoff that would bring us at last to Duluth I put my hand on Plympton 's sleeve . " Freddy , listen , I know I must sound like a fool , but could you just introduce us and give me some time alone with her ? We 've so many friends in common  --  and perhaps other things as well  --  that I know there wo n't be any awkwardness . My God , I 've been pursuing her for months . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? I know my hope 's showing , and I hope  --  look , there I go again  --  you wo n't despise me for it , but I have to talk to her . I have to . " " Then you shall , " he said , and we turned onto the road that took us across the perimeter of the estate and drove for five miles and came to a gate where a gatekeeper greeted Lord Plympton and a chauffeur who seemed to materialize out of the woods got in and took the wheel while Freddy and I moved to the back seat , and we drove together through the lovely grounds for another fifteen or twenty minutes and passed through anothergate , though I did not see it until we were almost on it  --  the queer , camouflaged electric fence  --  and through the windows I could hear the coughing of apes and the roar of lions and the bleating of Iambs and the wheezes and grunts and trebles and basses of a hundred beasts  --  though I saw none  --  and at last , passing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curving , beautiful driveway of the beautiful house and servants came to take our bags and others to open doors and an older woman in a long gown  --  Plympton kissed her and introduced her as his wife , the Lady Plympton I 'd never met ( " She came with guanacos on her crest , dear fellow , with the funny panda and the gravid slug . I married her  --  ha ha  --  to fill out the set " ) , and he bolted upstairsbeckoning me to follow . " Come on , come on , " he said , " ca n't wait to get here , then hangs back like a boy at his first ball , " and I bounded up the stairs behind him , and overtook him . " Wherever are you going ? You do n't know the way . Go on ,  |p159go  on , left , left , " he called . " When you come to the end of the hall turn right into the Richard Five wing . It 's the first apartmentpast the Ballroom of Time . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind , only to come to the door , her door , and stop outsideit . Plympton came up behind me . " I knew you would n't , " he said , and knocked on the door gently , " Jane , " he called softly . " Jane ? Are you decent , darling ? " " Yes , " she said . Her voice was beautiful . " Shall I push open the door ? " " Yes , " she said , " would you just ? " He shoved me gently inside , but did not cross the threshold himself . " Here 's Brewster Ashenden for you , " he said , and turned and left . I could not see her clearly . No lights were on and the curtainswere still drawn . I stood in the center of the room and waited for a command . I was physically excited , a fact which I trusted the darkness to shield from Jane . Neither of us said anything . Then I spoke boldly . " He 's right . I trust he 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Plympton . Here 's Brewster Ashenden for you , ' he said . " " Did he ? That was presumptuous of him , then . " " I am Brewster Ashenden of the earth , air , fire and water Ashendens and this moment is very important to me . I 'm first among eligible men , Miss Loes Lipton . Though that sounds a boast , it is not . I have heard of your beauty and your character . Perhaps you have heard something of mine . " " I never listen to gossip . And anyway hearsay is inadmissible in court . . . ship . " I knew she was going to say that . It was exactly what I would have replied had she made the speech I had just made ! Do you know what it means to have so profound a confirmation  --  to have , that is , all one 's notions , beliefs , hunches and hypotheses suddenly and entirely endorsed ? My God , I was like Columbus standing in the New round World , like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself it was like having my name cleared ! I 'm talking about redemption . To be right ! That 's everything in life , you know . To be right , absolutelyright , one hundred percent correct in all the essentials , that 's all we want . And whoever is ? Brewster Ashenden  --  once . I had so much to tell her . I began to talk , a mile a minute , filling her in , breathlessly bringing her up to date , a Greek stranger 's after-dinner talk in a king 's gold palace on an inaccessible island in a red and distant sea . A necessary entertainment . Until then I had not known my life had been a story . Then , though I could not see it in the dark room , she held up her hand for me to stop . It was exactly where I would have held up my hand had Jane been speaking . " Yes , " she said of my life , " it was the same with me . " Neither of us could speak for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brewster , think of all the  --  " "  --  coastlines ? " I said . " Yes , " she said , " yes . All the coastlines , bays , sounds , capes and peninsulas , the world 's beaches scribbled round all the countriesand continents and islands . All the Cannes and Hamptons yet to be . Shores in Norway like a golden lovely dust . Spain 's wild hairline , Portugal 's long face like an impression on coins . The nubbed antlers of Scandinavia and the great South Americanporterhouse . The French teapot and Italian boot and Australialike a Scottie in profile . " " Asia running like a watercolor , dripping Japan and all the rest , " we said together . " Yes , yes , " she said . " God , I love the world . " " There 's no place like it . " " Let me wash up on seashores and eat the local specialties , one fish giving way to another every two or three hundred miles along the great continuous coasts like an exquisite , deliciousevolution . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out at the outpost . Do you feel that way ? " " What , are you kidding ? An earth , fire , air and water guy like me ? I do , I do . "  | " Family 's important , " she said . " You bet it is . " She giggled . " My grandfather , a New Yorker , was told to go west for his health . Grandfather hated newspapers , he did n't trust them and said all news  --  even of wars , heavy weather and the closing markets  --  was just cheap gossip . He thought all they were good for , since he held that calendars were vulgar , was the date printed at the top of the page . In Arizona he had the New York Times sent to him daily , though of course it always arriveda day or two late . So for him the eleventh was the ninth or the tenth , and he went through the last four years of his life a day or two behind actual time . Grandfather 's Christmas and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He went to church on Easter Tuesday . " " Easter Tuesday , that 's very funny . " " I love the idiosyncratic ; it is all that constitutes integrity . Difference , nuance , hues and shade . Spectra , Brewster . That 's why we travel , perhaps , why we 're found on all this planet 's exotic strands , cherishing peculiarities , finding lost causes , chippingin to save the primitive wherever it occurs  --  " " Listen to her talk . Is that a sweetheart ? " "  --  refusing to let it die , though the old ways are the worst ways and unhealthy , bad for the teeth and the balanced diet and the comfort and the longevity . Is that selfish ? " " I think so . " " Yes , " she said pensively . " Of course it is . All taste 's a cruelty at last . We impede history with our Sierra Clubs and our closed societies . We 'll have to answer for that , I suppose . Oh , well .. . Brewster , do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I had an Uncle Clifford who believed that disease could be communicated only by a draft when one was traveling at high speeds . He wore a paper bag over his head even in a closed car . He cut out holes for the eyes , for despite his odd notion he dearly loved to travel and watch the scenery go by . Even going up in elevators he wore his paper bag , though he strolled at ease through the contagion wards of hospitals dispensing charity to the poor . "  | " Marvelous . " " Yes . " " Brewster , this is important . Do you know things ? People should know facts . " I know them . " " I knew you knew them . " " I love you , Miss L6es Lipton . " " Jane , " she said . " Jane . " She was weeping . I did n't try to comfort her , but stood silentlyin place until she was through . I knew she was going to tell me to open the curtains , for this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curtains , Brewster . " I went to the bay and pulled the drawstring and light came into the room and flooded it and I turned to the chair in which Jane was sitting and saw her face for the first time . She looked  --  II exactly as I knew she would look , though I had never seen a photograph of her or yet been to any of the houses in which her portraits were hung . All that was different was that there was a darkish region under her eyes and her skin had an odd tan . " Oh , " I said , " you 've a spot of lupus erythematosus there , do n't you ? " " You do know things , Brewster . " " I recognized the wolflike shadow across the eyes . " " It 's always fatal . " " I know . " " The body develops antibodies against itself . " " I know .

" " No , " she said . " Because of this fatal disease ? That does n't matter to me . I beg your pardon , Jane , if that sounds callous . I do n't mean that your mortality does n't matter to me . I mean that now that I 've found you I ca n't let you go , no matter how little time you might have left . " " Do you think that 's why I refused you ? Because I 'm going to die ? Everyone dies .

I knew that it was because I did n't know why you refused me . Oh , I 'm so confused . I 'm  --  wait . Oh . Is it what I think it is ? " She nodded . " Oh , my God . Jane , please .

She studied me . " I believe you , " she said finally . " That is , I believe you seriously wish to undo what you have done to yourself . I believe in your penitent spirit , I mean . No . Do n't kiss me . You must be continent henceforth . Then ... " " We 'll see ? "  | " We 'll see . " " The next time , Jane , the next time you see me , I swear I will have met your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where I was to sleep by a grinning Plympton . He asked if , now that I had seen Jane , I would like to go with him on a tour of the estate . " Not just yet , Freddy , I think . " " Jane gave you something to think about , did she ? " " Something like that . " Was ever any man set such a task by a woman ? To undo defilement and regain innocence , to take an historical corruptionand will it annulled , whisking it out of time as if it were a damaged egg going by on a conveyor belt . And not given years  --  Jane 's disease was progressive , the mask a manifestation of one of its last stages  --  nor deserts to do it in . Not telling beads or contemplating from some Himalayan hillside God 's extensive Oneness . No , nor chanting a long , cunning train of boxcar mantras as it moves across the mind 's trestle and over the soul 's deep , dangerous drop . No , no , and no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leper or going about in rags ( I still wore my mourning togs , that lover 's wardrobe , those Savile Row whippery flags of self ) or doing those bows and scrapes that were only courtesy 's moral minuet , and no time , no time at all for the long Yoga life , the self 's spring cleaning that could drag on years . What had to be done had to be done now , in these comfortable Victorian quarters on a velvet love seat or in the high fourposter , naked cherubs climbingthe bedposts , the burnished dimples of their wooden behindsglistening in the light from the fresh laid fire . By a gilded chamber pot , beneath a silken awning , next to a window with one of the loveliest views in England . That , at least , I could change . I drew the thick drapes across the bayed glass and , influenced perhaps by the firelight and the Baker Street ambience , got out my carpet slippers and red smoking jacket . I really had to laugh . This wo n't do , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important structural changes and get that dear dying girl to marry you if the firstp165thing you do is to impersonate Sherlock Holmes ? Next you 'll be smoking opium and scratching on a fiddle . Get down to it , Ashenden , get down to it . But it was pointless to scold when no alternative presented itself to me . How did one get down to it ? How does one undefilethe defiled ? What acts of kosher and exorcism ? Religion ( though I am not irreligious ) struck me as beside the point . It was Jane I had offended , not God . What good would it have done to pray for His forgiveness ? And what sacrilege to have prayed for hers ! Anyway , I understood that I already had her forgiveness . Jane wanted a virgin . In the few hours that remainedI had to become one . I thought pure thoughts for three hours . Images of my mother : one summer day when I was a child and we collected berries together for beach plum jelly ; a time in winter when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my mother was carding . I thought of my tall father in a Paris park when I was ten , and of the pictures we posed each other for , waiting for the sun to come out before we tripped the shutter . And recollected morningsin chapel in school in New England  --  I was seven , I was eight  --  the chaplain describing the lovely landscapes of Heaven and I , believing , wanting to die . I recalled the voices of guides in museums I toured with my classmates , and thought about World 's Fairs I had attended . The ' 36 Olympics , sitting on the bench beside the New Zealand pole vaulter . I remembered perfectpicnics , Saturday matinees in Broadway theaters , looking out the window lying awake in comfortable compartment berths on trains , horseback riding on a fall morning in mountains , sailingwith Father . All the idylls . I remembered , that is , my virginity , sorting out for the first time in years the decent pleasures of comfort and wonder and respect . But  --  and I was enjoying myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what did it amount to ? I was no better than a gangster pleading his innocence because he had once been innocent . I thought impure thoughts , reading off my long-time bachelor'shundred conquests , parsing past , puberty and old fantasy , reliving all the engrams of lust in gazebo , band shell , yacht andp166penthouse , night beaches at low tide , rooms , suites , shower stalls , bedrooms on crack trains , at the carpeted turnings of stairs , and once in a taxi and once on a butcher 's block at dawn in Les Halles  --  all the bachelor 's emergency landing fields , all his makeshift landscapes , propinquitous to grandeur and history , in Flanders Fields , rooms with views , by this ocean or by that , this tall building or that public monument , my backstage lovemakingtangential as a town at the edge of a map . Oh love 's landmarks , oh its milestones , sex altering place like sunset . Oh the beds and oh the walls , the floors and bridges  --  and me a gentleman !  --  the surfaces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of forests , everywhere but the sky itself a zone for dalliance , my waterfalls of sperm , our Laguardias of hum and droned groan . Recalling the settings first , the circumstances , peoplingthem only afterwards and even then only piecemeal , a jigsaw , Jack-the-Ripper memory of hatcheck girl thigh and night club singer throat and heiress breast , the salty hairs of channel swimmers and buttocks of horseback riders and knucklesof pianists and strapless tans of models  --  sex like flesh 's crossword , this limb and that private like the fragments in a multiple choice . And only after that gradually joining arm to shoulder , shoulder to neck , neck to face , Ezekielizing my partners , dem bones , dem bones gon ' walk aroun ' . Yes ? No . The smile was still on my face . And there in that Victorian counting house , I , lust 's miser , its Midas , touching gold and having it gold still , an ancient Pelagian , could not overcomemy old unholy gratitude for flesh , and so lost innocence again , even as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filling the locks of my body . " Make me clean , " I prayed , " help me to make one perfect act of contrition , break my nasty history 's hold on me , pull a fast one at this eleventh hour . " A strange thing happened . The impure thoughts left me and my blood retreated and I began to remember those original idylls , my calendar youth , the picnic and berry hunts , and all those placid times before fires , dozing on a couch , my head in Mother 's lap and her hands in my hair like rain on the roof and , My God , my little weewee was stiff , and it was stiff now too !  |p167It  was what I 'd prayed for : shame like a thermal inversion , the self-loathing that is purity . The sailing lessons and horseback rides and lectures and daytrips came back tainted . I saw how pleased I 'd been , how smug . Why , I 'm free , I thought , and was . " I 've licked it , Jane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holy as a wafer , my heart pink as rare meat . I was crap . Look at me now . " If she wo n't have me , I thought , it 's not my fault . I rushed out to show myself to her and tell her what I 'd discovered . I ran over it again to see if I had it straight . " Jane , " I 'd say , " I 'm bad , unsavory from the word go , hold your nose . To be good subsists in such understanding . So innocence is knowledge , not its lack . See , morality 's easy , clear , what 's the mystery ? " But when I stepped outside my suite the house was dark . Time had left me behind . The long night of the soul goes by in a minute . It must have been three or four in the morning . I could n't wake Jane ; she was dying of lupus erythematosus and needed her rest . I did n't know where Plympton slept or I would have roused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I went outside . But it was not " outside " as you and I know it . Say rather it was a condition , like the out-of-doors in a photograph , the colorsfixed and temperature unfelt , simply not factors , the wind stilled and the air light , and so wide somehow that he could walk without touching it . It was as if he moved in an enormous diorama of nature , a creche of the elements . Brewster Ashenden was rich . He had lain on his back on Ontario turf farms and played the greens of St. Andrews and Burning Tree , but he had never felt anything like Duluth 's perfect grass , soft and springy as theater seats , and even in moonlight green as billiard cloth . The moon , perfectly round and bright as a tennis shoe  --  he could make out its craters , like the eternally curving seams of a Spalding  --  enabled him to see perfectly , the night no more than the vaguest atmosphere , distant objects gyroscopically stilled like things glimpsed through the whirling blades of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ madonnas in classical paintings  --  one missed only the carefully drawn pillars and far , tiny palaces  --  blue-hilled horizons , knolls at the end of space , complex shores that trailed eccentrically about flat , black/ish planes of water with boulders rising from them . He thought he perceived distant fields , a mild husbandry , the hay in , the crops a sloping green and blue debris in the open fields , here and there ledges keyholed with caves , trees in the middle distanceas straight as the land they grew from . It was a geography of eclectic styles and landscapes , even the sky a hybrid  --  here clear and black and starred , there roiling with a brusque signatureof cloud or piled in strata like folded linen or the interior of rock . He walked away from the castle , pulled toward the odd , distantgalleries . His mood was a fusion of virtue and wonder . He felt solitary but not lonely , and if he remembered that he walked unprotected through the largest game preserve this side of the Kenyan savannah , there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strode powerfully toward those vistas he had seen stretching away in every direction from the manor . Never had he seemed to himself so fulfilled , and never , unless in dreams , had such seeming distances been so easily negotiated , the scenery changing every hundred yards or so , the hills that had appeared so remote easily climbed and giving way at their crests to tiny valleys and plains or thick , sudden clots of jungle . This trick of perspective was astonishing , reminding him of cunning golf courses , sudden doglegs , sand traps , unexpected waterholes . Everythingwas as distinctively charactered as foreign countries , natural borders . He remembered miniature golf courses to which he had been taken as a child , each hole dominated by some monolithic feature , a windmill , perhaps , a gingerbread house , a bridge , complicated networks of banked plains that turned on themselves , culs-de-sac . He thought that Duluth might be deceptivelylarge or deceptively small , and he several miles or only a few thousand feet from the main house  --  which had already disappeared behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paradise , to each seamed , successive landscape , the ease of his arrivals added to his sense of strength , and each increment of strength to his sense of purity , so that his exercise fed his feelings about his heart and happiness . Though he had that day made the long drive from London , had his interview with Jane ( as exhausting as it wasp169stimulating ) and done the hardest thinking of his life , though he had not slept ( even in London he had tossed and turned all night , kept awake by the prospect of finally meeting Jane ) in perhaps forty hours , he was n't tired . He wondered if he would ever be tired again . Or less gay than now . For what he felt , he was certain , was not mood but something deeper , a stability , as the out-of-doors was , as space was . He could make plans . If Jane would have him ( she would ; they had spoken code this afternoon , signaled each other a high language of commitment , no small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secret observations over mountains and under seas , the serious ventriloquism of outpost ) , they could plan not to plan , simply to live , to be . In his joy he had forgotten her death , her rare , personal disease in which self fled self in ultimate allergy . Lupus erythematosus . It was not catching , but he would catch it . He would catch her . There was no need to survive her . Togetherthey would grow the wolf mask across their eyes , death 's big spreading butterfly . It did n't matter . They 'd have their moralitytogether , the blessed link-up between appropriate humans , anything permissible between consenting man and consenting woman  --  anything , any bold or timid configuration , whatever the one craved and the other yielded , whatever whatsoever , love 's sanctified arrangements , not excluding the deathbed itself . What need had he to survive her  --  though he 'd probably not die until she did  --  now that he had at last a vehicle for his taste , his marriage ? He was in a sort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steps nor circled around , it seemed familiar . He stood on uneven ground and could see a line of low frigid mountains in the distance . High above him and to his right the great tear of the moon , like the drain of day , sucked light . At his feet there appeared the remains of  --  what ? A feast ? A picnic ? He bent down to investigate and found a few clay shards of an old jug , a bit of yellow wood like the facing on some stringed instrumntand a swatch of faded , faintly Biblical cloth , broadly striped as the robe of a prophet . As he fingered this debris he smelled what was unmistakably bowel . " Have I stepped in something ? " He stood and raised his shoe ,  |p170but  his glance slid off it to the ground where he saw two undisturbedlumps , round as hamburger , of congealing lion waste . It came to him at once . " I knew it was familiar ! The Sleeping Gypsy . ' This is where it was painted ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smashed jug and the tough cloth , which he now perceived had been forcibly torn . My God , he thought , the lion must have eaten the poor fellow . The picturehad been painted almost seventy-five years earlier , but he understood from his reading that lions often returned to the scenes of their most splendid kills , somehow passing on to succeedinggenerations this odd , historical instinct of theirs . Nervouslyhe edged away , and though the odor of lion dung still stung his nostrils , it was gradually replaced by more neutral smells . Clearly , however , he was near the beasts . He turned but still could not see the castle . He was not yet frightened . From what he had already seen of Duluth he understood that it was a series of cunningly stitched enclaves , of formal , transistorized prospects that swallowed each other transitionlessly . It seemed to be the antithesis of a maze , a surface of turned corners that opened up on fresh surprises . He thought of himself as walking along an enormous Mobius strip , and sooner or later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If he was a little uneasy it was only because of the proximity of the animals , whose presence he felt and smelled rather than saw or heard . Meanwhile , quickening his pace , he came with increasing frequencyto experience a series of deja vus , puzzling at first but then suddenly and disappointingly explicable . He had hoped , as scenes became familiar to him , that he was already retracing his steps , but a few seconds ' perusal of each place indicated otherwise . These were not places he had ever been , only places he had seen . Certainly , he thought , the paintings ! Here 's Cranach the Elder 's " Stag Hunt . " Unmistakably . And a few moments later  --  I 'll be darned , Jean Honore Fragonard 's " A Game of Hot Cockles . " And then Watteau 's " Embarking for Cythera , " will you look at that ? There was E. Melvin Bolstad 's " Sunday in the Country " and then El Greco 's " View of Toledo " without To/ledo . Astonishing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't think I care for that Constable , he thought ; why 'd they use that ? Perhaps because it was here . Gosh , is n't that a Thomas Hart Benton ? However did they manage that odd rolling effect ? That 's really lovely . I 'll have to ask Plympton the name of his landscaper . Jane and I will certainly be able to use him once we 're settled . Now he was more determined than ever to get rid of Franklin . And so it went . He strolled through wide-windowed Wyeths and gay , open-doored Dufys and through Hoppers  --  I 'll have to come back and see that one with the sun on it  --  scratchy Segonzacsand dappled Renoirs and faintly heaving Cezannes , and across twilled Van Gogh grasses and faint Utrillo fields and precise Audubon fens , and one perfect , wild Bosch dell . It was thrilling . I am in art , thought Brewster Ashenden , pleased to have been prepared for it by his education and taste . He continued on until he came to a small jewel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with low thin trees that came up almost to the water . It was the Botticelli " Birth of Venus , " which , like El Greco 's " View of Toledo " without Toledo , was without either Venus Zephyr , Chloris , or the Hour of Spring . Nevertheless it was delightful , and he took a seat on a mound of earth and rested , thinking of Jane and listening to the sea in a large shell he had found on the beach . " I 'm glad , " he said , speaking from the impulse of his mood now that his wanderings were done and the prospect of histheir  --  deathhad become a part of his taste and filled his eyes with tears , " I 'm glad to have lived in the age of jet travel , and to have had the money for tickets . " He grew contemplative . " There has never been a time in my life , " he said , " when I have not had my own passport , and never a period of more than four months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place for which there are shots . I am grateful  --  not that I 'd ever lord it over my forebears  --  that I did not live in the time of sailing ships . Noble as those barks were , they were slow , slow . And Dramamine not invented . This , for all its problems , is the best age to be rich in . I 've seen a lot in my time . "  |p172Then  , though he could n't have told you the connection , Ashendensaid a strange thing for someone at that moment and in that setting . " I am not a jerk , " he said , " I am not so easily writtenoff . Profound guys like me often seem naive . Perhaps I 'm a fool of the gods . That remains to be seen . But answers are mostly simple , wisdom is . " He was melancholy now and rose , as if by changing position he hoped to shake off this new turn in his mood . He looked once more at the odd pool and spoke a sort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jane would enjoy it . I wish I still had those two folding chairs the Bank of Americagave me for opening an account of five thousand dollars . We could come here tomorrow on a picnic . " He did not know whether to go around the pond or cut through the thin trees , but finally determined not to go deeper into the forest . Though he suspected the animals must be all around him , it was very quiet and he wondered again about them . They would be asleep , of course , but did n't his presence mean anything to them ? Had their queer captivity and the unusualcircumstances in which they lived so accustomed them to man that one could walk among them without disturbing them at all ? But I am in art , he thought , and thus in nature too , and perhaps I 've already caught Jane 's illness and the wolf mask is working someplace under my skin , making me no more significanthere than the presence of the trees or the angles of the hills . Walking around the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had changed . They were sparser , more ordinary . Ahead he spied a bluff and moved toward it . Soon he was again in a sort of clearing and here he smelled the smells . The odor of beasts is itself a kind of meat  --  a dream avatar of alien sirloin , strange chops and necks , oblique joints and hidden livers and secret roasts . There are nude juices in it , and licy furs , and all the flesh 's vegetation . It is friction which rubs the fleshly chemistry , releasing it , sending skyhigh the queer subversive gasses of oblique life forms . It is noxious . Separated as we are from animals in zoos by glass cages and fenced-off moats , and by the counter odors of human crowds , melting ice cream , pea/nut shells crushed underfoot , snow cones , mustard , butts of bun  --  all the detritus of a Sunday outing  --  we rarely smell it . What gets through is dissipated , for a beast in civilization does not even smell like a beast in the wild . Already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ animals might actually feel compunction , some subtle , aggravating modesty . But in Plympton'sjungle the smells were uninhibited , biological , profane . Their acidity brought tears to Ashenden 's eyes and he had to rub them . When he took his hands away he saw where he was . He had entered , he knew , the last of the pictures . Although he could not at first identify it , much was familiar . The vegetation , for example , was unmistakably Rousseau , with here and there a Gauguin calabash or stringy palm . There were other palms , hybridas the setting itself , queer gigantic leaves flying from conventionalEuropean trunks . The odor was fierce but he could n't leave . At his feet were thick Rousseauvian candelabras of grass , and before him vertical pagoda clusters of enormous flowers , branches dangerously bent under the weight of heavy leaves like the notched ears of elephants . Everywhere were fernlike trees , articulated as spine or rib cage , a wide net of the greenly skeletal and the crossed swords of tall grasses . There were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the entrancesto caves , black as yawns . The odor was even more overpoweringthan before , and had he not seen the vegetation he would have thought himself at the fermented source of the winish world . Yet the leaves and grasses and bushes and flowers were ripe . He reached out and touched a leaf in a low branch and licked his hand : it was sweet . Still , the place stank . The smell was acrid , actually hot . Here the forest was made impenetrableby its very odor and he started to back off . Unable either to turn away from it completely or to look at it directly , he was forced to squint , and immediately he had a striking perception . Seen through his almost closed eyes , the trees and vegetation lost their weird precision and articulation and became conventional , transformed into an ordinary arbor . Only then , halfp174blinded , he saw at last where he was . It was Edward Hicks 's " The Peaceable Kingdom , " and unquestionably the painter had himself been squinting when he painted it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was thrilled to be where lion and fox and leopard and lamb and musk ox and goat and tiger and steer had all lain together . The animals were gone now but must have been here shortly before . He guessed that the odor was the collective conflagration of their bowels , their guts ' bonfire . I 'll have to be careful where I step , he thought , and an enormous bear came out of the woods toward him . It was a Kamchatkan Brown from the northeastern peninsula of the U.S.S.R. between the Bering and Okhotsk seas , and though it was not yet full grown it weighed perhaps seven hundred pounds and was already taller than Ashenden . It was female , and what he had been smelling was its estrus , not shit but lust , not bowel but love 's gassy chemistry , the atoms and hormones and molecules of passion , vapors of impulse and the endocrinous spray of desire . What he had been smelling was secret , undergroundrivers flowing from hidden sources of intimate gland , and what the bear smelled on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; indeed , he did not even know that it was female , or what sort of bear it was . Nor did he know that where he stood was not the setting for Hicks 's painting ( that was actually in a part of the estate where he had not yet been ) , but had he discovered his mistake he would still have told you that he was in art , that his error had been one of grace , ego 's flashy optimism , its heroic awe . He would have been proud of having given the benefit of the doubt to the world , his precious blank check to possibility . All this changed with the sudden appearance of the bear . Not all . He still believed  --  this in split seconds , more a reaction than a belief , a first impression chemical as the she-bear 's musk  --  that the confrontation was noble , a challenge ( there 's going to be a hell of a contest , he thought ) , a coming to grips of disparate principles . In these first split @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the will , he believed not that the bear wasp175emblematic , or even that he was , but that the two of them there in the clearing  --  remember , he thought he stood in " The PeaceableKingdom "  --  somehow made for symbolism , or at least for meaning . As the bear came closer , however , he was disabused of even this thin hope , and in that sense the contest was already over and the bear had won . He was terrified , but it must be said that there was in his terror ( an emotion entirely new to him , nothing like his grief for his parents nor his early anxieties about the value of his usefulnessor life 's , nor even his fears that he would never find Jane Loes Lipton , and so inexpert at terror , so boyish with it that he was actually like someone experiencing a new drive ) a determination to survive that was rooted in principle , as though he dedicated his survival to Jane , reserving his life as a holdup victim withholds the photographs of loved ones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave him . So there was something noble and generous even in his decision to bolt . He turned and fled . The bear would have closed the gap between them and been on him in seconds had he not stopped . Fortunately , however , he realizedalmost as soon as he began his sprint that he could never outrun it . ( This was the first time , incidentally , that he thought of the bear as bear , the first time he used his man 's knowledge of his adversary . ) He remembered that bears could cruise at thirty miles an hour , that they could climb trees . ( And even if they could n't would any of those frail branches already bowed under their enormous leaves have supported his weight ? ) The brief data he recalled drove him to have more . ( This also reflex , subliminal , as he jockeyed for room and position in the clearing , a rough bowl shape perhaps fifty feet across , as his eye sought possible exits , narrow places in the trees that the bear might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but of course they swam , too  --  a hundred yards off through a slender neck of path like a firebreak in the jungle . ) He turned and faced the bear and it stopped short . They were no more than fifteen feet from each other . It suddenly occurred to him that perhaps the bear was tame . " Easy , Ivan , " he crooned , " easy boy , easy Ivan , " and thep176bear hearing his voice , a gentle , low , masculine voice , whined . Misconstruing the response , recalling another fact , that bears have weak eyesight , at the same time that he failed to recall its corollary , that they have keen hearing and a sharp sense of smell like perfect pitch , Ashenden took it to be the bear 's normal conversationaltone with Plympton . " No , no , Ivan , " he said , " it is n't Freddy , it 's not your master . Freddy 's sleeping . I 'm Brewster , I 'm your master 's friend , old Bruin . I 'm Brewster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The bear , excited by Ashenden 's playfultone , whined once more , and Brewster , who had admitted he was n't Plympton out of that same stockpile of gentlemanly forthrightness that forbade deception of any creature , even this bear , moved cautiously closer so that the animal might see him better and correct any false impression it might still have of him . It was Ashenden 's false impression that was corrected . He halted before he reached the bear ( he was ten feet away and had just remembered its keen hearing and honed smell ) and knew , not from anything it did , not from any bearish lurch or bearish bearing , that it was not tame . This is what he saw : A black patent-leather snout like an electric socket . A long and even elegant run of purplish tongue , mottled , seasonedas rare delicatessen meat , that lolled idiotic inches out of the side of its mouth . A commitment of claw ( they were nonretractile , he remembered ) the color of the heads of hammers . A low black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of teeth . Its solemn oval of face , direct and expressionless as a goblin 's . Ears , high on its head and discrete as antlers . Its stolid , plantigrade stance , a flash as it took a step toward him of the underside of its smooth , hairless paws , vaguely like the bottoms of carpet slippers . A battering ram of head and neck , pendent from a hump of muscle on its back , high as a bull 's or buffalo 's . The coarse shag upholstery of its blunt body , greasy as furniture . He knew it was not tame even when it settled dog fashionp177on the ground and its short , thick limbs seemed to disappear , its body hiding in its body . And he whirled suddenly and ran again and the bear was after him . Over his shoulder he could see , despite its speed , the slow , ponderous meshing of muscle and fat behind its fur like children rustling a curtain , and while he was still looking at this the bear felled him . He was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or collided with him , but he was sent sprawling  --  a grand , amusing , almost painlessfall . He found himself on the ground , his limbs spraddled , like someone old and sitting on a beach , and it was terrible to Ashendenthat for all his sudden speed and the advantage of surprise and the fact that the bear had been settled dog fashion and even the distance he had been sent flying , he was no more than a few feet from the place where he had begun his run . Actually , it took him several seconds before he realized that he no longer saw the bear . " Thank God , " he said , " I 'm saved , " and with a lightning stroke the bear reached down from behind Ashenden 's back and tore away his fly , including the underwear . Then , just as quickly , it was in front of him . " Hey , " Ashenden cried , bringing his legs together and covering himself with his hands . The tear in his trousers was exactly like the inside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aang , " said the bear in the International Phonetic Alphabet . Brewster scrambled to his knees while the bear watched him . " 6 hwm . " " All right , " Ashenden said , " back off ! " His voice was as sharp and commanding as he could make it . " Back off , I said ! " " KHAer KHOOnn . " " Go , " he commanded . " Go on . Shoo . Shoo , you . " And still barking orders at it  --  he had adopted the masterful , no-nonsense style of the animal trainer  --  he rose to his feet and actually shoved the bear as hard as he could . Surprisingly it yielded and Brewster , encouraged , punched it with all his considerable strength on the side of its head . It shook itself briefly and , as if it meant to do no more than simply alter its position , droppedp178to the ground , rolled over  --  the movement like the practiced effortof a cripple , clumsy yet incredibly powerful  --  and sat up . It was sitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and it was only then that he saw its sex billowing the heavy curtain of hair that hung above its groin : a swollen , grotesque ring of vulva the color and texture of an ear and crosshatched with long loose hairs ; a distended pucker of vagina , a black tunnel of oviduct , an inner tube of cunt . Suddenly the she-bear strummed itself with a brusque downbeat of claw and moaned . Ashenden moved back and the bear made another gesture , oddly whorish and insistent . It was as if it beckoned Ashendenacross a barrier not of animal and man but of language  --  Chinese , say , and Rumanian . Again it made its strange movement , and this time barked its moan , a command , a grammar of high complication , of difficult , irregular case and gender and tense , a classic of aberrant syntax . Which was exactly as Ashenden took it , like a student of language who for the first time finds himself hearing in real and ordinary life a unique textbook usage . 0 God , he thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do , and felt in his pockets for weapons and scanned the ground for rocks . The bear , watching him , emitted a queer growl and Ashenden understood that , too . She had mistaken his rapid , reflexive frisking for courtship , and perhaps his hurried glances at the ground for some stagy , bumpkinshyness . " Look here , " Ashenden said , " I 'm a man and you 're a bear , " and it was precisely as he had addressed those wives of his hosts and fellow guests who had made overtures to him , exactly as he might put off all those girls whose station in life , inferior to his own , made them ineligible . There was reproof in his declaration , yet also an acknowledgment that he was flattered , and even , to soften his rejection , a touch of gallant regret . He turned as he might have turned in a drawing room or at the landing of a staircase , but the bear roared and Ashenden , terrorized , turned back to face it . If before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by his opportunities  --  close calls arbitrarily exalted or debased men  --  he corrected them and made a remarkable speech.  | " You 're in rut . There are evidently no male bears here . Listen , you look familiar . I 've seen your kind in circuses . You must be Kamchatkan . You stand on your hind legs in the center ring and wear an apron and a dowdy hat with flowers on it that stand up stiff as pipes . You wheel a cub in a carriage and do jointed , clumsy curtseys , and the muzzle 's just for show , reassurance , state law and municipal ordinance and an increment of the awfulto suggest your beastliness as the apron and hat your matronliness . Your decals are on the walls of playrooms and nurseries and in the anterooms of pediatricians ' offices . So there must be something domestic in you to begin with , and it is to that which I now appeal , madam . " The bear , seated and whimpering throughout Ashenden 's speech , was in a frenzy now , still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strummed its genitalia like a guitar , and Brewster , the concomitant insights of danger on him like prophecy , shuddered , understanding that though he now appreciated his situationhe had still made one mistake . No , he thought , not madam . If there were no male bears  --  and would n't there be if she were in estrus ?  --  it was because the bear was not yet full-grown and had not till now needed mates . It was this which alarmed him more than anything he had yet realized . It meant that these feelings were new to her , horrid sensations of mad need , ecstasy in extremis . She would kill him . The bear shook itself and came toward him , and Brewster realized that he would have to wrestle it . Oh Jesus , he thought , is this how I 'm to be purified ? Is this the test ? Oh , Lord , first I was in art and now I am in allegory . Jane , I swear , I shall this day be with you in Paradise ! When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its hind legs and the two embraced each other , the tall man and the slightly taller bear , and Brewster , surprised at how light the bear 's paws seemed on his shoulders , forgot his fear and began to ruminate . See how strong I am , how easily I support this beast . But then I am beast too , he thought . There 's wolf in me now , and that gives me strength . What this means , he thought , is that my life has been too crammed with civilization . Meanwhile they went round and round like partners in a slowp180dance . I have been too proud of my humanism , perhaps , and all along not paid enough attention to the base . This is probably a good lesson for me . I 'm very privileged . I think I wo n't be too gentle with poor dying Jane . That would be wrong . On her deathbed we 'll roll in the hay . Yes , he thought , there must be positions not too uncomfortable for dying persons . I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ style . We must not be too fastidious about ourselves , or stuck-up because we are n't dogs . All the time he was thinking this he and the bear continued to circle , though Ashenden had almost forgotten where he was , and with whom . But then the bear leaned on him with all her weight and he began to buckle , his dreamy confidence and the thought of his strength deserting him . The bear whipped its paw behind Ashenden 's back to keep him from falling , and it was like being dipped , supported in a dance , the she-bear leadingand Brewster balanced against the huge beamy strength of her paw . With her free paw she snagged one sleeve of Ashenden'sHarris tweed jacket and started to drag his hand toward her cunt . He kneed her stomach and kicked at her crotch. arng . " " Let go , " he cried , " let go of me , " but the bear , provoked by the pleasure of Ashenden 's harmless , off-balance blows and homing in on itself , continued to pull at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in seconds had plunged Brewster 's hand into her wet nest . There was a quality of steamy mound , a transitional texture between skin and meat , as if the bear 's twat were something butchered perhaps , a mysterious cut tumid with blood and the color of a strawberry ice-cream soda , a sexual steak . Those were its lips . He had grazed them with his knuckles going in , and the bear jerked forward , a shudder of flesh , a spasm , a bump , a grind . Frenzied , it drew his hand on . He made a fist but the bear groaned and tugged more fiercely at Ashenden 's sleeve . He was inside . It was like being up to his wrist in dung , in a hot jello of baking brick fretted with awful straw . The bear 's vaginalmuscles contracted ; the pressure was terrific , and the bones in his hand massively cramped . He tried to pull his fist out butp181it was welded to the bear 's cunt . Then the bear 's muscles relaxedand he forced his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thick medium of mucoid strings , wet gutty filaments , moist pipes like the fingers for terrible gloves . Appalled , he pulled back with all his might and his wrist and hand , greased by bear , slid out , trailing a horrible suction , a concupiscent comet . He waved the hand in front of his face and the stink came off his fingertips like flames from a shaken candelabra , an odor of metal fruit , of something boiled years , of the center of the earth , filthy laundry , powerful as the stench of jewels and rare metals , of atoms and the waves of light . " Oh Jesus , " he said , gagging , " oh Jesus , oh God . " " u(r)m , " the bear said , " wranff . " Brewster sank to his knees in a position of prayer and the bear abruptly sat , its stubby legs spread , her swollen cunt in her lap like a bouquet of flowers . It was as if he had looked up the dress of someone old . He could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adjustments , obscenely posed , flexing her muscular rut , shivering , her genitalia suddenly and invisibly engined , a performance coy and proud . Finally he managed to turn his head , and with an almost lazy power and swiftness the bear reached out with one paw and plucked his cock out of his torn trousers . Ashenden winced  --  not in pain , the paw 's blow had been gentle and as accurate as a surgical thrust , his penis hooked , almost comfortable , a heel in a shoe , snug in the bear 's curved claws smooth and cool as piano keys  --  and looked down . " OERaKH . " His penis was erect . " That 's Jane 's , not yours ! " he shouted . " My left hand does n't know what my right hand is doing ! " The bear snorted and swiped with the broad edge of her forepawagainst each side of Ashenden 's peter . Her fur , lanolized by estrus , was incredibly soft , the two swift strokes gestures of forbiddenbrunette possibility . And of all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this was the most reasonable , the most elegantly strategic : that he would have to satisfy the bear , make love to the bear , fuck the bear . And this was the challenge which had at last definedp182itself , the test he 'd longed for and was now to have . Here was the problem : Not whether it was possible for a mere man of something less than one hundred and eighty pounds to make love to an enormous monster of almost half a ton ; not whether a normal man like himself could negotiate the barbarous terrains of the beast or bring the bear off before it killed him ; but merely how he , Brewster Ashenden of the air , water , fire and earth Ashendens , one of the most fastidious men alive , could bring himself to do it  --  how , in short , he could get it up for a bear ! But he had forgotten , and now remembered : it was already up . And if he had told the bear it was for Jane and not for it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ error and shock . It occurred to him that he had not been thinking of Jane at all , that she was as distant from his mind at this moment as the warranties he possessed for all the electric blankets , clock radios and space heaters he 'd picked up for opening accounts in banks , as distant as the owner 's manuals stuffed into drawers for all that stuff , as forgotten as all the tennis matches he 'd played on the grass courts of his friends , as the faults in those matches , as all the strolls to fences and nets to retrieve opponents ' balls , the miles he 'd walked doing such things . Then why was he hard ? And he thought of hanged men , of bowels slipped in extremis , of the erectile pressuresof the doomed , of men in electric chairs or sinking in ships or singed in burning buildings , of men struck by lightning in open fields , and of all the random , irrelevant erections he 'd had as an adolescent ( once as he leaned forward to pick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend from boarding school ) , hardness there when you woke up in the morning , pressures on the kidney that triggered the organ next to it , that signaled the one next to it , that gave the blood its go-ahead , the invisible nexus of conditions . " That 's Jane 's " he 'd said , " not yours . My left hand does n't know what my right hand is doing . " Oh , God . It did n't . He 'd lied to a bear ! He 'd brought Jane 's name into it like a lout in a parlor car . There was sin around like weather , like knots in shoes . " What the hell am I talking about ? " he yelled , and charged the bear.  |p183And  it leaned back from its sitting position and went down on its back slowly , slowly , its body sighing backward , ajar as a door stirred by wind , and Ashenden belly-flopped on top of it  --  with its paws in the air he was a foot taller than the bear at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if it were some child he tumbled  --  pressed on its swollen pussy as over a barrel . He felt nothing . His erection had withered . The bear growled contemptuously . " Foreplay , foreplay , " Brewster hissed , and plunged his hand inside the bear . I 'm doing this to save my life , he thought . I 'm doing this to pass tests . This is what I call a challenge and a half . The bear permitted the introduction of his hand and hugged him firmly , yet with a kind of reserve as though conscious of Ashenden 's eggshell mortality . His free hand was around her neck while the other moved around inside the bear insinuatingly . He felt a clit like a baseball . One hand high and one low , his head , mouth closed , buried in the mound of fur just to the side of the bear 's neck , he was like a man doing the Australian crawl . The bear shifted . Still locked together , the two of them rolled over and over through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but she permitted him to come out on top . His hand had taken a terrific wrenching however , and he knew he had to get it out before it swelled and he was unable to move it . Jesus , I 've stubbed my hand , he thought , and began to withdraw it gently , gingerly , through a booby-trapped channel of obstacle grown agonizing by his injury , a minefield of pain . The bear lay stock still as he reeled in his hand , climbing out of her cunt as up a rope . ( Perhaps this feels good to her , he thought tenderly . ) At last , love 's Little Jack Horner , it was out and Ashenden , his hand bent at almost a right angle to his wrist , felt disarmed . What he had counted on  --  without realizing he counted on it  --  was no longer available to him . He would not be able to manipulate the bear , would not be able to get away with merely jerking it off . It was another illusion stripped away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Come on , he urged his cock , wax , grow , grow . He pleaded
