 | TO MOST PEOPLE in that northeastern corner of North America ? in Canada 's Province of Quebec , where the mother tongue of four out of five is French ? Guy Lafleur is a very special hero . He plays right wing for the Montreal Canadiens hockey team , which once again has clinched the Stanley Cup . The nineteenth time ! As the traditional victory parade creeps past hundreds of thousands , men swear with admiration . Women want to kiss him . " Not just because he 's the scoring champion of the National Hockey League , " a sportswriter tells me . " For many years French Canadians have felt treated as second-class citizens . When Lafleur scores , they feel they have scored too . " Another special hero is Gilles Vigneault ( pages 448-9 ) . He writes poems and songs , and he sings of hardy people he knew in his fishing village , of long snowy winters and the simple ways of the past . Of native riches ? iron ore and pulpwood ? going cheap to outsiders . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my country . " He does n't mean Canada . He means Quebec . Thousands listen or sing along in theaters and crowded clubs , before TV sets or under open skies . " We love him , " I am told . " He expresses what 's in our hearts . " Evidently something powerful is astir in this land that is home to five out of six million French Canadians ( map , page 440 ) . Fewer and fewer here call themselves that ; more and more say they 're Quebecois ( Kay-bay-KwAH ) . It 's not the provincial assembly anymore , it 's 1'Assemblee Nationale . By its law , French is now the official language of Quebec . Robert Bourassa , while Prime Minister of Quebec , coined the phrase " cultural sovereignty . " His newly elected successor , Rene Levesque ( page 441 ) , is pledged to go further . He sees a definite possibility of separation from Canada , and a fully independent Quebec ? perhaps before the end of this decade . Who are these self-assertive Francophones , as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anglophones ? What is this culture they are so determined to defend ? And why do many of them wish to go all the way to independence , which would tear the Confederation of Canada apart ? During numerous trips to Quebec in the past two years I found many eager to explain . " My ancestors came here from Brittany before the Pilgrims came to Plymouth Rock , " said Philippe de Gaspe Beaubien in Montreal . " They came to perpetuate a way of life and spread the gospel to the Indians . They also liked beaver skins , of course , and made money selling them in Europe . " A parchment on his living-room wall attests to a grant of acreage along the majestic St. Lawrence , in the heart of New France . By authority of Louis XIV , the Most Christian King ? meaning most Catholic . Mr. Beaubien said his family has been in business for more than three hundred years , but not just for business ' sake .

It 's a theme you hear often : We are the heirs of the earliest European settlers , we did n't come to lose our identity in some melting pot , and we like to have fun . That noun . by the way , has become part of the Quebec culture . My French-Canadian dictionary spells it both fun and fonne . Mr. Beaubien studied at Harvard . He owns 14 radio and TV stations , and does not want to cut Quebec off from Canada . " I consider all Canada my country . But I understand those who want to cut us off and isolate us ? their desire for independence , for a life in which one 's identity is n't threatened every day . They 've been underdogs so long .... " That 's another recurrent Quebec theme : The Anglophone minority has been the boss . while Francophones , on the whole , are low on the socioeconomic scale . A massive federal Sign of the times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stop sign in front of a church in Sainte-Anne-de-la-Perade . Bilingual labels , initiated to ease language tensions , satisfy neither English- nor French-speaking Canadians . Both prefer their own language exclusively . French culture , which once rallied around the Roman Catholic Church and rural life , has survived today 's urbanization and weakening of religious influence . Calls for independence continue to mount .  | inquiry bore that out : Anglophones dominate the Quebec economy ; Francophones who want to get somewhere in business or industry had better adopt Anglophone ways . It 's been like that since Britain conquered New France in 1760 , says historian RobertLionel Seguin . " To keep those 60,000 Francophone Canadiens quiet , the British pledged to them retain their religion and French civil w . They expected them to be swamped by Anglophone immigration . " But no . A century later , when Britain crethe Confederation of Canada , Francones were still overwhelmingly in the majority in Quebec Province . " Thanks mainly to a phenomenal birthrate , " says Professor Seguin . " By 1867 there were a million . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broody uprising of les Patriotes in 1837 . To make the Confederation more palatable to Quebec , French was made an official language in the new federal Parliament in Ottawa . Education remained in provincial hands , hence church-run schools have helped the French language to survive . To this day , many in Quebec tend to think of themselves as a nation , as a distinct people whose interests may not be identical with Canadian interests . In World War II , so a senior Quebec civil servant told me , nearly everyone had a cousin or two who were hiding in the woods to escape military conscription . " They got food from everyone . Police going after them got shot at . " It was a major Canadian crisis in 1942 . PIERRE ELLIOTT TRUDEAU , a Quebec Francophone , became federal Prime Minister nine years ago , aiming to hold the Confederation together ; separatist terrorists had been throwing bombs . Seeking to mollify Quebec and to make French Canadians feel more at home in all Canada , Parliament voted for bilingualism ? to make federal services @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the predominantly Anglophone civil service work in both languages , thousands of federal officials have had to take as much as a year off to study French lest their advancement be blocked . Many say they do n't like it ? bilingualism goes too far . As I learned soon enough , many Quebecois do n't like it either . For them it does n't go far enough . 11 N. NELLEN . L AESON Standard-bearer of Quebec sovereignty , Rene Levesque is surrounded by supporters and the press after the victory last November of his Parti Quebecois . Fiery but levelheaded , the former Liberal cabinet minister formed this party of independence in 1968 . Separation , he now says , will come only if approved by referendum .  | PROFESSOR SEGUIN studies Quebec folk civilization and keeps hundreds of antique artifacts close to his house in Rigaud . I wander among his sugar molds , plows , sleds , windmills , and relocated barns . They reflect the influence of northwestern France , of Picardy , Normandy , Poitou . By late 18th century , there 's British influence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's folklore , the past , good for students and museums , " he says . " Our living culture is our kitchen , how we eat and drink . Our Latin temperament and the chic of our women . Our popular singers , our films and theater .... " Above all , he says , it 's the language . " That 's not a jewel , to put on occasionally , but a tool for daily life , in school , in the factory and the office , in the street , everywhere . Without my language I can not feel at home . If I go to Bordeaux or Geneva , I feel at home ; in every part of Quebec I 'm at home ? but only a few miles from here . . . I 'll show you .

" " If the police here stop a Francophone and speak to him in English , he must reply in English . They might speak to him in French ? and he 'll be grateful , that 's bilingualism . To him it 's a victory . But in Quebec I must be addressed in French . So to me bilingualism is a defeat . You understand ? " I do n't . He sighs . " We Quebecois do n't think and act like other French-speaking people in North America . They are minorities . They must get along in English ; eventually they will be absorbed . We think and act as a majority . That makes all the difference . A minority thinks you can share a country . But to me , my country is like my wife , I do n't want to share her ! The trouble is we are still colonized , politically and economically . " He adds what amounts to the separatist credo : " Only independence can give us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cultural survival . " Quebec represents a sixth of Canada in area , a fourth in population . If Quebec separates , what happens to the rest ? A student  | tells me : " Look , if my sister breaks a leg , I 'll run to take care of her . If some lady in Toronto has trouble , I 'll be sorry to hear it , but it 's not my affair . " Such Francophone feelings in Quebec find a counterpoint in the other nine provinces . Resentment against federal regulations to implement bilingualism has been rising in the east , in New Brunswick , where English speakers outnumber French 2 to 1 . And even more in the west , in Alberta where it 's 2 7 to 1 , and in British Columbia where it 's 48 to 1 . Says a Vancouver shopkeeper , " Why should we have to see French on every beer can and cereal box , when those Quebec fanatics are turning to unilingualism ? " As a widely reprinted editorial put it , " Go suck a lemon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .... " Prime Minister Trudeau calls it tragic . He warns of real danger that Canada will break up over French-English antagonism . ENOUGH OF FRICTION for a while ; I 'll look into the Quebec penchant for having fun . There are carnivals and festivals dedicated to song , the arts , and sports . To cod and herring . To strawberries and apple cider . " We have 230 festivals , in fact , the year round , " says the secretary-general of the government-supported Quebec festivals association . " There are commercial overtones , of course , but there is a cultural basis . We give new value to traditional things . " I 've missed the Rouyn-Noranda miners ' festival and the shrimp festival at Matane . But happily it 's fun week in Roberval on beautiful Lac Saint-Jean , whence the Riviere Saguenay flows to the St. Lawrence . Swimmers will race twenty-five miles across the lake , but first it 's handicraft exhibits and a jazz ballet , bonfires and petanque , a French sort of bowling with fist-size metal balls . Dining tables are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Quebec western style . The cdleur orders swignez ! The fiddling is fierce . An old man tells me that 's really an old Burgundian song , which says good wine puts you to sleep but love wakes you up again . In pursuit of good times much thought is given to the stomach . Here 's a middle-class recipe for a fun evening in Montreal : " We start at six with pate , soup at six-thirty , at eight the meat course . Then a salad , it helps the stomach . By nine , cheese ; an hour after that , chocolate cake and a coffee . All along a little wine , good for the digestion . " The speaker is no grizzled gourmet ; he 's 19 . " By eleven o'clock , cognac . And music of course . We now . have our own Quebec rock . We talk all night politics , music , poetry . The girls are highly politicized too . All the kids I know are independantistes .

At an old-fashioned New Year 's Day feast in the countryside , grandfather 's blessing may be followed by an aromatic pie of chicken , hare , partridge , and lard . After I talked to an antique dealer about the rising prices of old Quebec furniture , he asked me into a back room of his shop , spread newspapers on a table , and put something miraculous into an electric skillet . It was snow goose , shot by himself on the Ile aux Grues ( pages 452-3 ) . The tenderness of that pinkish tawny flesh , the gravy , the aroma ! It was poetry , for the stomach and for the soul . My host rolled me a cigarette of black tobacco . " Let 's just say we 're civilized . " I STAND in the Place Royale , in the Lower Town area of Quebec City ?

" In Upper Town looms the old seminary founded by Bishop de Laval , whose diocese Box seats for the Quebec show : Apartment dwellers indulge in a popular FrenchCanadian diversion ? people-watching from their porches . In the theater of provincial economics , the Quebecois also hold a viewers ' role . Despite the Francophones ' overwhelming numbers , private wealth remains largely in the hands of Anglophones , whose English has traditionally been the language of big business .

A long day 's drive away to the east , along the Baie des Chaleurs at the base of the Gaspe Peninsula , I see a battered hulk : a remnant of one of the ships sent to reinforce the French Army that still hoped to recapture Quebec City in 1760 . The convoy met a superior British squadron . It was 56 cannon against 265 , and the end of New France . TODAY the Gaspe coast is an ethnic mosaic , the legacy of French-speaking Acadian , evicted from New Brunswick ; of Loyalists who fled the newly separated United States ; * of Irishmen fleeing famine and religious oppression . Some villages are preponderantly Anglophone . Around Perce , I note in the telephone book , live several families named Vibert . Anglophone or Francophone ? Their common ancestor Peter Vibert came from the island of Jersey four generations ago . Today Clarence Vibert speaks no French . His cousin Andrew Vibert speaks no English ; he pronounces his name Veebear . Andrew 's bilingual brother , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , learned French to please mother , who did n't . He named the kids Ruth , Arthur , Edith , Mabel .... " He 'd be out fishing for days at a time , or away for weeks in winter , cutting wood . So the mother 's language took over at home . It 's a classic way of assimilation . The town of Gaspe itself has changed in the past fifty years from 80 percent Anglophone to 80 percent Francophone . The local bishop tells me a predecessor started it . He established a hospital , a teachers ' training school , a seminary ? employing hundreds of newcomers , all French speakers . Young Anglophones find few good jobs in Gaspe nowadays , I am told . " If a girl speaks only passing French , she can sell patates frites , but how could she work for a lawyer ?

But no , any moment now there 'll be the roar of that ubiquitous Quebec product , the snowmobile . This land , in fact , is highly industrialized . Only one Quebecois in five now lives in the countryside . All in all , the standard of living is pretty much up to that of the rest of North America . Something drastic happened in 1960 . The death of an old provincial prime minister had led to the demise of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rapid transformation of Quebec into a modern state . The so-called Quiet Revolution was on : Health insurance for everyone . Secularization and vast expansion of education . Reorganization of most of the hydroelectric industry into state-controlled Hydro-Quebec  | ? and the building of gigantic dams , fostering Francophone pride . An explosion of installment buying , songwriting , painting , and publishing ; a proliferation of TV . It amounted to profound social change . In the pulp-mill town of La Tuque I see a huge convent for rent . In regional centers such as Chicoutimi and Rimouski , seminaries used to groom the privileged for universities , and the poor but bright for the priesthood . Now these are junior colleges , state administered and open to all , free . The divorce rate has soared , the birthrate has dropped . The church has lost many practicing members and much of its secular power . Some parish churches depend for revenue on weekly bingo .

" Thus a Quebec City bureaucrat on the newly prevalent attitude of contestation. of challenge ? the insistent nonacceptance of something one does n't think is right . I am mindful of this on the day of the patron saint of Quebec , June 24 , the day of St Winter-locked in idleness , the village of Riviere-au-Renard on the Gaspe Peninsula ( left ) awaits spring thaw to pursue cod , redfish , and herring . With stocks diminishing , fishing has been overtaken by tourism as a source of income in the Gaspe , a rocky fist thrust into the Gulf of St. Lawrence .

SEVEN HUNDRED MILES away , in Quebec City , Prime Minister Bourassa welcomes me to his office near the National Assembly .

" But Quebec needs capital from outside , and I think the United States is Quebec 's best friend . Remember , we are a land of Frenchspeaking people within the North American framework . We want to stay French and keep our culture , but we also want to belong in North America , spiritually and economically .

In the office of a British-owned paper company the manager asks him , " Why improve our plant if you 're going to kick us out of Quebec ? " Levesque replies he would n't do it all  | at once , just little by little . " That was a joke , " he says to me afterward . " We do n't intend to take over any plants ; it would cost us millions .

Our schoolbooks were full of how the British beat us 200 years ago , that they 're strong and we 're weak . It 's an underdog feeling . You fear you ca n't make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't buy a stove made in Quebec . She said how could it be any good ? We do n't trust ourselves ; we 're almost glad when we do n't succeed .... " A businessman : " I 'm not separatist , few businessmen are . But I think we must take our affairs into our own hands , and I 'm sure we could succeed , but those with capital have  |p464  no confidence in our management abilities . I fear that to achieve our aim we may be obliged to pass through socialism .... " Said a union leader : " We reject capitalism . If independence comes , it will start a process for changing the society . But will Canada and the U. S. accept that ? Then all may not be so peaceful . " Pierre Vallieres was a theoretician of the FLQ , the Front de Liberation du Quebec , which threw bombs in the 1960 's and kidnapped two men in 1970 , one of whom died . The Canadian Army briefly occupied Montreal . The FLQ evaporated . Vallieres is out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lake , writing . He now thinks armed revolutionary action would be futile : " The Quebecois want to hold on to their present way of life , which is a lot of waste ? in other words , behave like Americans . " He 's supporting the PQ . NOVEMBER 15 , 1976 , astounds all Canada . Province-wide elections in Quebec give the PQ 71 seats out of 110 . No one had expected that many so soon . A Montreal sports arena explodes with joy as Rene Levesque arrives . He thanks all voters who overcame their fears of change . He vows " to give ourselves the Quebec we desire , a homeland for all who live in it and love it . " Women scream , men wipe their eyes . Again the arena explodes . " Excuse me , " says a middle-aged man crushed against me . " We 've awaited this day for 216 years . Now the hard work begins . " The morning after , an Anglophone sociologist calls it the blackest day for Canada he 's ever seen . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now I know I 'll really have a chance for a job as an engineer .... " Nine days later Rene Levesque takes over as Prime Minister . The first task is to give Quebec good government , he says . The referendum on independence will come within two or three years . " The trend toward independence appears to be irreversible . " Federal Prime Minister Trudeau reaffirms his dedication to an indivisible Canada . But Canada can not , must not , survive by force , he says . He still bets on bilingualism . It appears certain that for years to come Canada will be in crisis . CAN A POET perhaps see furthest ahead ? I talked often with Gilles Vigneault . One night in a national park near Hull , across the river from Ottawa , a downpour cut short one of his outdoor concerts . In a nearby log cabin , by a fire , he reflected about his song " When We Go to Louisiana . " For many Quebecois , that word conjures up the fate of the descendants of those unfortunate Francophone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ customs and language , disappearing . Vigneault 's song is an allegory , of Quebec in effect going to Louisiana . It implies a question : Even if independence comes , what of the inroads of English , the barrage of American foods , films , and TV ? words , ideas , values , everything American ? Toward the end , the song slips into a French that 's Anglicized . To some it 's just a catchy blues number . To some it 's heartbreaking . Vigneault said : " Maybe we 're bound to disappear . Deep down we feel it . In twenty years , in fifty ? Quebec is a little island of five million Francophones . How can we survive with 13 million Anglophones around us in Canada and 216 million Americans next door ? " My song is a little bell . It is very important to ring a bell when the fire is in the barn . then people can come and put it out before it gets to the house . " While writing , I received a tape of Gilles Vigneault @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheerful : " The country that interests me is not a piece of earth , a bit of land . Land is n't a country . Take the people away from it , and you have a dam or a parking lot . When I ay country , I mean people ? the country that is inside of people , inside each of us . When we put all those countries inside us together ? we will have a real country for us all . " The applause , as usual , was thunderous .
