txt The House is expected to vote today or tomorrow on a compromise proposal for a partial lifting of the Congressional embargo on arms shipments to Turkey . The embargo , in effect since February , had previously been twice suspended by Congress for several months to ? advance a settlement of the dangerous quarrel between Greece and Turkey  --  but without success . Furthermore , American pressure led to counter-pressure . Turkey has called for discussions on the future of about twenty American bases , of importance to NATO and to the monitoring of Soviet missile shots and verification of the strategic arms limitation treaty ( SALT ) with Moscow . The Senate has voted by a narrow margin to lift the Turkish arms embargo completely . But a House majority and many others who are concerned about the present impasse are rightly unwilling to go that far , remembering Turkey 's illegal use of American-made arms in her invasion of Cyprus last year and reluctance to withdraw substantially from occupied areas of Cyprus . Two former American mediators in the Cyprus dispute ? George Ball and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now while linking their continuation later to progress in the Cyprus negotiations . Without such a link , they fear an unfavorable impact on the democratic Greek Government and an open door for misuse of American arms by other nations , besides Turkey , committed to employ American-supplied arms only for defensive purposes . It is vital that this latter principle not be further undermined by whatever new arrangement is reached on the Turkish embargo . ? The compromise proposal now pending before the House is much more restrictive than that originally agreed on by President Ford and the House leadership , but its link to resumption of the Cyprus negotiations is less direct than that in the Ball-Vance proposals . The House bill would continue to bar further grant aid to Turkey as well as delivery of grant aid already authorized . The embargo would be lifted primarily to permit delivery of cash and credit arms " in the pipeline , " arms for which Turkey already has contracted and more than three-fifths of which have been paid for . But Turkey would be denied further cash or credit purchases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sales were to be specifically authorized by Congress in the next foreign assistance act , Turkey would only be able to make direct commercial purchases on its own , a difficult and little-tried procedure . The President would be required to report to Congress every sixty days on the progress of the Cyprus negotiations . Turkey has been put on notice publicly by the Administration that if Congress relaxes the embargo and Turkey " adopts an unconstructive or inflexible attitude " in the Cyprus talks , the Administration then could not save Turkey from re-enactment of the embargo . Inasmuch as the present total embargo has failed to advance a Cyprus settlement , we are driven to . the conclusion that a more flexible approach should be tried again . The Senate bill clearly goes too far in totally wiping out the sanctions properly imposed against Turkey for last year 's gross misuse of American arms . The House bill , while hardly a perfect instrument , is at least closer to what is needed .                @ @ @ @ @
