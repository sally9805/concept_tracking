It might have been a sports event , a church sermon , an opera , a musical comedy . It was , in fact , all of those things . Produced at Manhattan 's Judson Memorial Church , A Look at the Fifties comprised an entrancing hodgepodge of tap dancing , singing , recitations and thunderous chorales providing running commentary on , of all things , an actual basketball game . It won rave reviews , packed the church for three weekends recently-then vanished . So it goes with the work of the Rev. Al Carmines , who wrote the show and is fast emerging as one of New York 's finest composers of theater music . Because Carmines is also the practicing minister at Judson Memorial , most of his productions have to be sandwiched between other functions at the church . <P> Unsmirched Wilde . One day last week , for example , Carmines zipped uptown to Manhattan 's Town Hall for a recital of songs from some of the 58 shows he has written since 1961 . Looking like a saintly , unsmirched Oscar Wilde @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fleet-fingered piano , and filled the hall with resounding delight . <P> Carmines ' music is extravagantly eclectic . He writes songs about war , Joan of Arc , peace , Gertrude Stein , pornography , Jesus Christ and W.C. Fields , all in a stylistic gamut that runs from Monteverdi to Montenegro . His favorite form is an extension of the turn-of-the-century ballad , on which he imposes anything that catches his fancy : tangos , hillbilly hymns , blues , echoes , jazz , gospel shouts , Puccini pastiches . <P> The son of a harmonica-playing sea captain , Carmines was born 35 years ago in Hampton , Va . Until age 17 , he I planned to become a concert pianist , Then he took stock of his keyboard talents and decided on the ministry instead . " But in college at Swarthmore , " he says , " I became an atheist . Later on I realized that you do n't have to be a fanatic to believe in God , so I grew out of that . " After graduating from Union Theological Seminary , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ church theatrical group . Carmines accepted on two conditions : no censorship and no religious dramas . " God does n't disappear when you do n't talk about him , " he explained . <P> When Carmines began writing his own shows , a few ( Peace , In Circles , Promenade ) were picked up for commercial runs in off-Broadway theaters , and Carmines won four Obie awards - off- Broadway 's equivalent to the Oscar . Now he is turning increasingly to performing . Last January he had a successful stint as pianist-singer in Manhattan 's Downstairs at the Upstairs . Carmines insists , though , that he is not tempted to leave the church for full-time show biz . " The two great doctrines of Christianity are salvation and creation , " he says . " There has been too much concern with the first . I want to do something about the second . "
