DAMIEN- OMEN II Directed by Don Taylor Screenplay by Stanley Mann and Michael Hodges <P> Damien , the devil 's spawn of The Omen , which was such a large success two summers ago , is alive and well and living in Chicago in this sequel . Unfortunately , the movie is not well at all and can not even be said to be alive . One expects little enough from sequels , but even that bare minimum is not attained by this clunker . <P> Part of the problem is that little Damien has miraculously aged almost a decade in the two years since we left him tearless at his parents ' grave , a nominal orphan at five . That angelic-looking child - so hard to believe Satan had anything to do with him ! - is now a broody cadet in a military school . Though the deviltry goes somewhat further than short-sheeting the beds or spreading rumors about saltpeter in the food , there is still not enough contrast between Damien 's visible aspect and his true nature to make him either lively or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disastrously erred by telling their story in a bluntly objective manner . One reason the original worked so nicely was that events unfolded mainly from the point of view of Damien 's disbelieving parents . Even after they began to see that there was something fishy about their offspring , they still had to discover the hard way just how large was the conspiracy of devil 's disciples assigned to protect the secret of his origins and mission . In the new movie most of Damien 's protectors telegraph their satanic allegiance the minute they appear , and William Holden as his decent uncle-guardian is constantly kept at a distance from the lad 's evil doings . <P> Since we are also shielded from the few suspicions that Holden is permitted , we never make the kind of identification with a strong , appealing , endangered figure that the horror genre requires . The result is a movie full of much tedious talk relieved by the occasional gaudy murder . <P> For the record , Lee Grant plays Holden 's wife , the veterans Sylvia Sidney and Lew Ayres are present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his cousin , who seems to represent heaven-inspired goodness , are played by Jonathan Scott-Taylor and Lucas Donat . In the end , Damien survives , for no good reason except the producers ' hopes to squeeze one more sequel out of him . It is , of course , possible that they are Beelzebub 's agents in a new strategy of boring us so profoundly that we will turn to evil to cheer ourselves up . <P> <P> - Richard Schickel
