txt The contest for the most coveted unwritten , unoutlined book in modern American and international publishing ? the memoirs of Henry A. Kissinger  --  has been won by Little . Brown &; Company of Boston , a subsidiary of Time Inc . It won out over a half dozen other publishers . The spirited , behind-the-scenes negotiations , including blind offers and high figures suggested by Mr. Kissinger 's admirers , bore some of the secret touches of the former Secretary of State 's own diplo-macy No dollar amounts have been disclosed by ArthUr H Thornhill Tr , chairman and president of Little , Brown , or Mr Kissinger 's literary representative , Marvin Josephson , president of International Creative Management . But educated gues , es by other book publishers , including several who had made offers for the memoirs , placed the figure at $2 million This would be for the North American book rights  --  the United States and Canada  --  plus a share of paperback and book-club sales All other rights to the book has e been retained by Mr. Kissinger . Publishing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another $3 million , bringing the total price to $5 million . This figure does not include possible television rights . The price of worldwide book and magazine rights is anticipated to reach $1.5 million outside North America . The first serial rights  --  that is , for pre-book publication or near-book publication excerpts in newspapers and magazines  --  are estimated to be worth another $1.5 million , in the United States , Canada and elsewhere . Trans-At'antic Traffic Early next month , Mr. Josephson , chairman of International Creative Management 's parent company , Marvin Josephson Associates Inc. , will visit his offices in Paris and London to receive bids for foreign rights . A stream of foreign book and magazine publishers has flowed across the Atlantic in recent months  --  especially from West Germany  --  to see Mr. Kissinger or his agent or lawyers . Because of the link between Little , Brown and Time Inc , which in 1968 acquired the Boston publishing house that was founded in 1837 , there was immediate speculation that Time would have the inside track on publishing the magazine version of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Josephson agency , presumably to the highest bidder . Nevertheless , as was reported last November , Mr Kissinger 's legal representative  --  who was handling book bids before Mr. Kissinger acquired the powerful agent  --  was Carlyle Elwood Maw , counsel to Cravath , Swaine &; Moore , the firm that also handles legal work for Time Inc . The book contract was signed in New York last Monday by Mr , Kissinger while it was said that he was sunning himself in Mexico . He has since returned there by way of Washington , and is now continuing his vacation with his wife . ' One Big Book ' While in New York , Mr. Kissinger met with Ned Bradford , former editor in chief of Little , Brown , and now its senior editor . He will be the book 's editor " I found him to be a genial , affable guy , " Mr. Bradford said of Mr. Kissinger . The memoirs will be " one big book , of 400,000 to 500,000 words , covering his stewardship in the White House and the State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intends to treat his role in the Government from 1968 to 1976 in depth . " said Mr Thornhill of Little Brown , who will oversee the book 's publication " I believe his personal evaluation and depiction of some of the most momentous events in United States history will make his book fascinating and extremely valuable . " Among the subjects the hook will encompass are the former national security adviser 's role during the Vietnam War , his trip to China , his adventures and diplomacy in the Middle East and elsewhere , while serving under presidents Nixon and Ford " Inevitably , he will have to discuss Watergate , " said a participant in the book 's negotiations . Mr Kissinger will begin outlining and researching the book upon his return from Mexico . He has told Little , Brown that he hoped to deliver the manuscript at the end of next year . The book will be published in the fall of 1979 , after close coordination on translation rights with book publishers around the world in order to prevent advance leaks of the material . Sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ publishers , said in a telephone interview that he was putting together a plan that would include publication In the Commonwealth countries Sir George was the publisher of Mr. Kissinger 's first book , " A World Destroyed . " No foreign publisher has as yet obtained any rights to the memoirs . When Scherz , a Swiss publisher , announced few months ago that it had succeeded in doing so , " the Telexes around the world went crazy , " according to an American representative of several European book and magazine publishers . Scherz later denied the report . ' A False Scent ' One West German publisher who is a longtime friend of Mr Kissinger met with him in recent weeks in the United States and went away thinking he had acquired the rights and knew exactly what the book would be about " It will be called ' Conversations With Mao , " the German publisher said . " That 's the book Henry wants to write first " This , too , proved to be a false scent . In the 13-page outline of the Nixon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Book Fair in midSeptember , a few passing references were made to Mr. Kissinger . For example , Mr. Nixon takes credit in the outline for inspiring the start of the secret talks with the Peking Government within a week after his inauguration in 1969 . These talks were high points of Mr. Kissinger 's career as Secretary of State . Mr. Nixon 's memoirs , acquired by Warner Books , ate paperback publisher , are slated to be published at the end of this year , but no hard-cover publisher has been announced , nor has a firm publication date been set . The New York Times syndication affiliate , Special Features , controls pre-book serialization rights . Publishing sources in New York said the Nixon memoirs were bound to clash factually with those written by Mr. Kissinger . " If Mr. Kissinger disputes Mr. Nixon on his t ersion of Watergate or the China trip , " said a publisher whose bid of $1.5 million for the Kissinger book was unsuccessful , " it could ne newsmaking and intriguing . If the Kissinger memoirs serve to answ er the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Nixon and Ford years , the Secretary of State or the President ' it 'll be a hell of a book , especially if the answer us Kissinger " Another publisher in New York said ; that by 1979 , two or three other events. , of a diplomatic or military nature could occur in the world that would make ivCr , Kissinger 's account appear to be ancient history It was also noted that Little , Brown would have to urge Mr. Kissinger to shed the language of diplomacy that characterizes his precious works if the book is to achieve popular appeal .
