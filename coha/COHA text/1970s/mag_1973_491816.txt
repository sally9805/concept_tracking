Pat has their respect , if only because of his fantastically successful career as a showman . A lad out of Florida , descended from Daniel Boone , he lived in Tennessee as a child . Pat nevertheless made it early with his smooth , pleasant voice as a two-time winner in the Ted Mack amateur contests . A star many times on the Arthur Godfrey show . Master of his own TV variety show for Chevrolet . Lead in a number of big-money movies . His vocal recordings have sold over 30 million copies . He had everything by ordinary standards . He graduated magna cum laude from Columbia University . He was a partner in a business grossing more than $80 million . Thanks to his youth in the mountains ( where he broke his nose three times , plus his right arm , left wrist and collarbone ) he is a rugged chap who frequently pairs up with such as Arnold Palmer in pro-am appearances . The fact of the matter seems to be that Pat Boone never got it into his head that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a couple of miles every morning , wearing a Los Angeles Dodgers warm-up jacket , among other things , which he treasures , as well as one of a collection of goofy hats . One such jog ( not too gentle a pastime in rugged Beverly Hills where once the silent cowboy sagas were filmed ) he passed by Lucille Ball 's house , and lo ! there were Lucy and her husband , Gary Morton , out front . Now , Pat also has a habit of carrying a compact cassette with him to listen to music , or perhaps a sermon or two as he jogs along . Lucy was so intrigued by this electronic windmill passing her door that she stopped him to ask him whether he was listening to the ball game , and if so , what was the score . Learning that he was engrossed in a sermon , they got to talking about religion and before he knew it , they 'd exchanged some heartfelt views and had quite a time of it together . This thrilled him so deeply ? ( imagine Lucille @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his thought went ) ? that when Pat jogged along afterwards and encountered Jimmie Stewart , also out front of his residence , the Lucy trance was still so deep on him ( Lucy has a way of doing that to people , because she really is something ! ) that all he could fetch up for the distinguished Mr. Stewart was an airy wave of the hand . The point of the story , of course , must be made clear : Lucy had so enchanted Pat , the great lady and the young jogger , that even the revered Mr. Stewart seemed a mere mortal by comparison . But the story is of equal parts  --  Lucy 's charm , but also Pat 's genuine humility . Pat has suffered across certain years because of the split personality demanded by his profession and his beliefs  --  the actor and the religious man  --  and he is free to confess that there were times when he felt that it was destroying him and his happiness , only to discover that an all-out commitment to religion gave him the uplift he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his life . Pat has found his answer in religion , and he is outspoken about it . He fits comfortably into the Jesus Movement of today , which gives him a big " in " with the young crowd , which you might have thought he had lost by now . He wowed the young people for twenty years , but how can he still do it ? One way , of course , is through identification . The Jesus Movement is big with youngsters today . Disillusioned with a war they often rejected on moral grounds , puzzled in many cases by the well-upholstered meaninglessness of their parents ' lives , finding questions more often than answers in education , youth has not so much copped out as stood still  --  wondering if anything is ever going to happen to make life the shining experience they had been promised . One answer is simple faith , which is at the heart of the Jesus Movement and in very short supply elsewhere in modern society . Rat Boone is a leader in the Jesus Movement . Reading about Pat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if he had not been a member of such a belief in spirit long before it attainedthe name in our time . He writes amusingly of his many trips up and down the main aisle of his church in childhood , as his mother firmly marched him outside and outdoors for an on-thespot spanking to mend his churchly manners , and then returned him to their pew for a demonstration of newly found saintliness . He mentions the treatment as having been something of a regular weekly habit , which came to amuse the congregation mightily and suggests that he had a will of his own from the very beginning . But once the lessons sank in , apparently they never left him . His books since then show that his spiritual beliefs were with him all the way . I am pleased at that  --  it would be unthinkable otherwise . It is something of a personal conjecture , but I suspect that it is the Jesus Movement which has caught up with Pat , and not the other way around . But of course that does not matter at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no bones about where he stands today , and he does this so forthrightly that possibly the other Hollywood stars envy him a bit . He is at the same time their professional peer and the possessor of a spiritual strengh wholly foreign to most of them . In his recent book , A New Song , Pat Boone goes right to the heart of the matter : " Educators , business leaders and statesmen admit that the problems of our day are staggering . Obviously we need more than human wisdom . Sir Winston Churchill before his death said ' Our problems are beyond us . We are a generation staggering around the rim of hell ' ... Plainly the answer lies only with the Lord . " The Hollywood entertainer who is concerned with the vast reaches beyond human wisdom , I concluded , must be worth talking to ! I asked for an interview with some small trepidation , I confess , but Pat 's response was gracious and immediate . Waiting in the Pat Boone home in Beverly Hills  --  the maid had mentioned that the Boones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were all due momentarily from different directions  --  my eye fell on a comical lamp in the family room . It had white shoes for a base . ( " White Shoes " ? the old trademark of Pat Boone as he progressed from milking his cow Rosemary back home in Tennessee , his head filled with dreams of singing glory , to the top rung of show biz . ) Then Pat walked in , lean and athletic looking , dressed in casual clothes . We went directly to the subject , " Do you think people can be changed-today in the same way as on the first day of Pentecost in the Bi-ble ? " " Yes . I think there is a new outpouring of God 's Spirit  --  the final outpouring . " Then with the famous Pat Boone smile , " I am just glad I got in on it . The thing that happened to me , and happened to Shirley and then to all the girls , that has been happening to hundreds all around us and to thousands we hear about , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time came about three or four years ago when 1 needed to experience miracles , and so did my whole family . For if there were not the possibility of some supernatural intervention of God into our lives , then our marriage was over , our family would be dissolved . My career had lost all purpose , and I felt it would soon end . Also I had tremendous financial problems that were threatening to bankrupt me . Every important area of my life was just about gone , and only a miracle or a series of miracles would save my whole world . It was then I just had to cry out to God . " At this point , four lovely , fresh-looking , teen-age girls came and joined us . Each girl had the Boone stamp of a friendly smile and frank , trusting eyes . But as we talked each one cut her own individual mold , and four distinct personalities emerged . Although all four were active in school and concerned to do their best , singing as a family took priority . I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cheryl , the oldest , responded , " It makes it hard to make close friends . It is very difficult for people to understand that our lives are so unpredictable , and that we ca n't always be the friends they want us to be . But there are many beautiful people who do understand . " Shirley , Pat 's beautiful wife , had come in during this conversation , standing back a little but listening closely as each one spoke . Now she took her place beside Pat . " I think the thing that I have noticed for all of us is a boldness  --  which is a scriptural way of knowing that you have received the Holy Spirit . It is more than just being like a little child ; it is also the boldness to tell about it . It is the ability to be more bold under all conditions , on national television , at the inauguration and other places . We can stand up and be counted for Jesus because it is not a concept , it is not a theology , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the depths of your heart . When you are trying to force a position on people , then you are involved in ' churchianity , ' but now we are just trying to share Jesus with them . " " I was a successful entertainer for over eighteen years , " said Pat . " The material things we have are mainly things we already had  --  very little of it is new . " " We are grateful for the things we have , but the whole point is that God does hear people 's prayers . He is interested in their daily lives . He is practical . He is real . And He is near . If you are in desperate shape and you cry out for a miracle and it happens  --  material , emotional , spiritual , whatever the miracle --  you know God is there , that He has heard your prayer . However He answered it , it is a treasure , and to you  --  it is a miracle ! " We are not just sitting around being religious . We love and laugh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swim . We sing together , are involved in homework together and the dating , and everything that is really fun and vital . But God is teaching us that life is a partnership , that we have something to give to people . " Another thing l would like to mention is the domesticity that has happened in the last two years . Shirley now is doing all our cooking , most of the housekeeping , tending to her grandmother , and running around taking care of the children . Here is a woman who has written One Woman 's Liberation , and she is loving her home more than ever and finding new dimensions in it . And the girls are sewing , cooking , writing songs and poems , drawing , planting and growing things- getting back to the basics of human experience and family life . God is prompting in the girls the desire to do these womanly things of cooking and sewing , nursing and growing . They date , but it really does n't consume them . They can also enjoy just being at home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ busy in the kitchen . 1 could hear faint conversations and an occasional giggle which vaguely located the girls in different parts of the upper story . I asked : " Is it difficult to share your faith with other entertainers ? " and " Have any other entertainers had your same experience ' ? " " In this entertainment community , we have always been something of an oddity . But more and more , we are being approached by entertainers , privately , about all kinds of diverse problems . A number of well-known people are now starting a Bible study in our home . Some are coming just because they are curious . Some have been baptized in our swimming pool . " In answer to my second question , Pat told me that Johnny Cash and his wife June had both been baptized in the Holy Spirit . And then : " I do n't think Bob Goulet will mind if I tell this , since he said it right out loud in front of Jimmy Caan ( the guy who played the hot-blooded older son in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Greg Morris . " We were doing a charity basketball game and were back in the dressing room . Bob Goulet came busting up to me and in his vibrant , ebullient way says , ' Boone , how do you get the Holy Spirit in you ? ' I was sort of stunned . Then Bob said , ' There 's some things about myself I do n't like . Want to get them changed ! ' " And I said , ' Bob , it is very simple . You ask ! ' " No ! ' Bob went on , ' I want to know that it has happened . I want to know that He is in there . I want to get changed ! ' He meant business . " ' Well , ' I repeated , ' you ask . ' Jesus said to ask and you shall receive . I did n't say that , He did . And He is the one who administers this baptism of the Holy Spirit . You just ask , and then you will know . Can you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ' " Things got real still because the others could not join in this conversation , and I had given Bob a very direct answer . ' Ask ! Ask to he filled , just as you asked to he saved . If you mean it , and you are quiet before God , then He will fill you  --  and you will know it . Your life will change . ' " Only the Saturday before this I had gone to see the Boone family take part in a show at Melodyland. it was a new musical and narration combination called " Come Together , " a powerful joyful witness to the reality of God 's love and unity . Melodyland is the part of the Disneyland complex which , over considerable opposition , became a haven for the spiritually hungry and turned off generation . It had originated with Pastor Ralph Wilkerson 's Christian Center Church . Now , at Disneyland , no week ever goes by without hundreds of people finding spiritual renewal and " coming to know Christ . " Meanwhile , the Melody-land School of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for ministerial work . There it stood . The big tent , It was Monday evening , but people were filing into classes , and the Bookstore was crowded . I heard greetings of " Praise the Lord ! " and " Hallelujah , Brother ! " There was peace on the faces of the people that I saw . I thought of a verse in Psalms , " I will offer in his lent sacrifices with shouts of joy ; I will sing and make melody to the Lord . " Is it possible that a new outpouring of God 's Spirit is occurring ? And if so , would it happen in such an unlikely place as a show hall across from Disneyland  --  or in the heart of a Hollywood entertainer ' ? Why not ' ? ZI But there are n't many people who can afford that kind of money . Even for a sure thing . So what do you think about 10 dollars ? That 's all-10 dollars . And you unless  --  and until  --  you decided to keep the book because it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , traveling first class and living in the best hotels may not be your idea of fun . As for me , I think it sure beats working for a living . See you at the track .
