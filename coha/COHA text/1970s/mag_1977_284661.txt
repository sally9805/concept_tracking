The Dodgers No Longer Seeing Red <P> Despite any rumors , Cincinnati Reds Manager Sparky Anderson has not returned to the used-car business . It 's tough to tell though , considering the clunker he has been driving lately . It certainly bears no resemblance to the Big Red Machine that cruised by the Yankees in four straight games last October for the team 's second straight World Series victory . Five weeks into the season the Reds were blowing leads , big and small , failing to produce in the clutch , surrendering runs in bunches , falling down in the base paths and sputtering along under .500 . " This has been a real team effort , " observes two-time MVP Joe Morgan sarcastically . The kind that put the Reds at one point as many as 11 games behind their traditional rivals in the National League 's Western Division and the hottest team in baseball : the Los Angeles Dodgers . <P> The Dodgers won 22 of their first 26 games , the quickest start of any major league team since 1955 , when baseball @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only two of their first 24 , coasted to the pennant , then whipped the dreaded Yankees for their first-ever World Series win . Those were the " Bums " of Campanella , Reese , Hodges and Robinson , the " Duke " of Flatbush and big Don Newcombe , whose pinch hitting was as fearsome as his fastball . There was also a little lefthander on the pitching roster named Tommy Lasorda . He was shipped back to the minors after compiling an un-Dodger-like earned run average of 13.50 in only four appearances . <P> Now 49 , Lasorda is in his rookie season as manager of the Dodgers . After 27 years as a spear carrier in the organization , he is enjoying the big job . Says he : " Managing during this streak has been a lot more fun than it was watching from the bench back in ' 55 . " An open , ebullient man , subject to sudden attacks of overstatement ( Dodger Stadium is " blue heaven on earth " ; " Cut me , I bleed Dodger blue " ) , Lasorda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the art of keeping his own counsel . " I believe in whooping it up , patting guys on the back , enthusiasm , " says Lasorda , whose fealty to his team is so strong that he would like to continue to be of service after death . " They can just put the Dodger schedule on my tombstone , " he says . " Visitors to the cemetery can check it to see if the Dodgers are at home or away . " <P> The team has responded brilliantly to Lasorda 's gusty enthusiasm . They are leading the league in hitting , home runs and runs batted in . Of the starting rotation - Don Sutton , Rick Rhoden , Doug Rau , Tommy John and Burt Hooton - John and Hooton are the only ones to have lost games in the first five weeks of the season . Sutton , the ace of the staff , like a former Dodger righthander , Carl Erskine , catches the corners of the plate with his curve - and batters looking at third strikes . On the infrequent occasions when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bullpen . <P> <P> His earned run average is 1.85 , and Lasorda calls him " the Hope diamond . "
