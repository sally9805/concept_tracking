txt Letters : Stewardess Fingers a ' Smuggler ' Letters : Stewardess Fingers a ' Smuggler ' To the Editor . On May 8 , my husband , our young daughters and I took a Pan-Am flight nonstop from Tokyo to San Francisco . Our 747 was not full , so I decided to stretch out on my own seat and two adjacent empty seats for the last several hours of the 10-hour flight . I was wearing an inexpensive long necklace . The necklace was so long that it could easily have slipped off while I dozed , so I took it off and put it in the right front pocket of my husband 's suit jacket . ( He was sitting upright , not planning to sleep . ) Upon waking , I took the necklace out of my husband 's pocket and put it back on . I walked off the plane wearing the necklace outside my suit blouse and jacket , exactly as I had boarded , the necklace in ** view . At Customs in San Francisco , we were taken aside by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sorry to have to tell us that a Pan-Am stewardess had reported my having handed my husband some jewelry during the flight . He asked us for an explanation . I explained the incident as I have done above , my explanation was accepted , and we were on our way . This episode so enraged me that I wrote about it at length to William Seawell , president and chairman of Pan American World Airways , Inc . In part , I wrote to protest the stewardess-spy 's ineptitude . If she could observe me removing the necklace , why could n't she also observe me putting it back on ? And in part , I wanted to know if the stewardess had acted on her own behalf or if she was carrying out a Pan-Am policy . I received a reply from Patricia M. Cody , director of Pan-Am 's Office of Consumer Action . The pertinent paragraph reads : " As to the jewelry incident , one of the stewardesses contacted admitted having reported it to Customs . In her view , it appeared suspicious and , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it upon arrival . In answer to your specific question , PanAm gives no such instruction . In fairness , however , I must add that we do not and , in fact , can not discourage our people from awareness of the obligation of good citizenship . It was most unfortunate that in this instance that awareness was misapplied . " I am writing in the hope that our unpleasant experience will prevent your readers from having a similar experience with bounty hunters . Washington Susari SELEEKAN The United States Customs Service reports that it is aware of " bounty hunters , " citizens on the lookout for a reward for turning in airline passengers as suspected smugglers . The incentives are spelled out in a law which states : " Any person not an officer of the United States who ... furnishes to any Customs officer any original information concerning any fraud upon the Customs revenue .. . perpetrated or contemplated .. . which leads to a recovery of any duties withheld , may be awarded a compensation of 25 per cent of the net amount recovered , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ copy of the statute covering this " Award of Compensation to Informers " ( Title 19 , Section 1619 , Tariff Act of 1931n , the Customs Service spokesman said that all other information on the subject was classified  --  the amount paid out yearly , the number of informants and cases . In a 32-page annual report on the Customs Service for fiscal 1974 , there is no reference to informants , even though entire sections are devoted to police dogs employed in the detection of drugs and the use of airplanes , ships and computers in the war on smuggling . Asked about the dangers of false accusations , the Customs official in Washington said : " It depends on the astuteness of . the informant whether the information is valid ; if it 's worthless , we do n't pay and apologize for any inconvenience that might have been caused the person accused . " Customs officers have been given the search and seizure authorization at borders under the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution . We face an inevitable conflict with travelers because we 're interfering with their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are simply trying to prevent it . Thankfully , in the jet age , a professional working relationship has developed between the Customs Service and airline employes . This does not mean the average tourist has to be more circumspect ; he just has to be honest . " ? Ed UGLY AMERICANS ? To the Editor : " Who says Americans are always insensitive abroad ? " asks your letter writ // er Riley . Hughes of Wash ' ingtert ( Travel Section , June 29 ) . 1 do , for one , Mr. Hughes , if they are typified by your group of table-hopping associates bursting into " God Bless America . " Seriously , Mr. Hughes , who needs it ? It might easily have been that the French tourists were as much in their cups as the Georgetown University confraternity , in which case probably no harm was done nor little memory of it carried over to the following morning . But as a rule of thumb , Mr. Hughes , no European likes , really likes , to have displays of American chauvinism imposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their patriotism , which , after All , is a rather private matter . Would Americans like it if my compatriots stood up in a Washington restaurant and sang  --  God forbid ? " God save the Queen ? " And since the singing was admittedly bad , this whole thing can indeed be classified as American gaucherie . In.stead of " embracing , " it could have produced an inciiient , a. brawl . Other American tourists would do well not to follow the example of Mr. Hughes and his fiends and especially not be taken in by the former 's sentimental interpretation of it . Unless you are a paid entertainer , do not sing in a restaurant . The advice is to be universally observed . BETTY D. WAMSLEY Bergenfield , N. J. AIR TRAVEL TIP To the Editor : Two airline tickets are sometimes cheaper than one when traveling in Europe . This spring , my wife and I wanted to fly from Dubrovnik , Yugoslavia , to Zurich , Switzerland . The JAT airline office in Yugoslavia was quite happy to issue Dubrovnik-Zurich tickets at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheaper than international fares , l bought Dubrovnik-to-Ljubljana , Yugoslavia , tickets for $18 each and Ljublignato-Zurich tickets for $64 each . Dividing the trip this way saved my wife and me $60 . The short stopover in Ljubljana proved to be no more trouble than the stopover in Zagreb that goes with the more expensive international fare . However , there is a slight drawback in luggage weight allowance . Flights inside of Yugoslavia permit up to 15 kilograms whereas international flights permit 20 . If necessary , pay the few dollars overweight charges and you 'll still be way ahead , A. A. GOLDBERG Stamford , Conn . FRENCH CUISINE To the Editor : Being a lover of French provincial cuisine , I must admit I could almost taste some of the classic dishes of the area as described by Evan Jones : " Perigord , Land of Truffles and Foie Gras , Castles and Caves " ( Travel Section , June 8 ) . But having spent several holidays in the Perigord region , I was a little disappointed that Mr. Jones did not elaborate on la cuisine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should experience . Take , for example , the lowly crudites which in most French meals consist of unappetizing raw vegetable appetizers . Recently for luncheon at the Hotel Bonnet , a small inn nestled in a grove of walnut trees in Beynac , I was shocked when crudit  --  s turned out to be no less than twelve delectable dishes consisting of : cepes bordelaise , those large local mushrooms saut  --  ed with garlic and parsley ; a very delicate celery rernoulade : coeurs de palmier ( hearts of palm ) ; quenelles a la carclinale , small balls of minced pike covered with a bright red sauce of lobster pur  --  e and truffles ; plus marinated beets , cucumbers , eggplant pieces , green peppers , cauliflower ; a mixture of lentils and shallots , an artichoke and mussels in heavy cream ! I followed all of this with a truite ato : // noix , excellent trout from the nearby Dordogne River covered with slivered walnuts and broiled in butter . My friend enjoyed a caille aux raisins , quail on a bed of grapes poached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with dessert , wine and service , came to about $13 . FORREST MCMAINS Newton , N.J. To the Editor : Evan Jones 's article on the Perigord evoked memories of one of the greatest restaurant-hotel experiences of our lives . In February of 1973 , midway through a sabbatical year in France , my husband and I. our 8-year-old twins and 4-year-old , started out for Barcelona from Chinon with the intention of stopping whenever the spirit moved us . The eight-hour drive took us three days . We stopped in the city of Auch , at the Hotel de France . After settling the children , my husband and I made our way to a table , where we were treated like royalty . The meal started with Gascon ham ( rather like Smithfield , served in enormous thin slices ) . I had sweetbreads in a delicate Bdarnaise sauce , my husband had eggs poached in Madeira . A simple lettuce-and-crouton salad accompanied the lou magret , a grilled breast of duck which resembled a thick beef steak but had a more delicate flavor . Like everyone who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our plates with it . To top off this meal , we were offered several flavors of home-made ice cream . My husband chose " prune " ( plum ) , which came with an Armagnac topping  --  at least that was how my husband interpreted the menu . What he got was the ice cream and a 11/2 gallon bottle of the liqueur , and the admonition to help himself . In gluttonous delight we settled ourselves in a twin to our children 's spacious suite . The piece de resistence was the bill , the next morning : dinners for the five of us , two double bedded suites for about $50 . CARL AND ANNE DENLINGER Merion , Pa . P.S. I LOVE YOU To the Editor : As a resident of Lancaster County , Pa. , a place so frequently visited by New Yorkers , I thought it only polite to return the call . Not too long ago , I did just that and found that your company manners could n't have been better . Here 's my mash note to New York and New York-ers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? and some of you were sitting on walls looking at it . Dark-suited businessmen ate ice cream cones , and school children in uniforms of navy blue had taken over one block jumping rope . The very best you offer is not expensive . Peoplewatching , walking , delicatessen-eating and museums do n't add up to a costly day  --  and you have the best of all these . The steps of the Metropolitan Museum were strewn with s'imners and lunchers and off to one side a homemade lemonade stand was run by hopeful kids just as lemonade stands should be . Inside , the museum urns were filled with fresh peonies so palely pink , so perfect that this gardener took them for paper . The museum 's Scythian exhibit was an encounter with all of man . He stores up treasures and carries a dagger . Then as now . And beauty is still beauty and what these people chose centuries ago as treasure is still treasure . By fashioning gold to their use and liking they made art to shame us . Without cities such as yours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience the awe of and continuity and fellowship with our past that such shows bring with them . Thanks . It was a great day in a great city . MARY HAVERSTICK Lancaster , Pa . ENCOUNTER IN PRAGUE To the Editor : have read with great interest Michael Leigh 's article " Encounter in Prague " ( Travel Section , June 29 ) . // However , I would like to point out that the rungs on the outer wall of the Altnai Synagogue leading to the attic could not have been climbed by Golem for the simple reason that they were added about 100 years ago upon the insistence of Prague 's Fire Department , while Golem existed ( lived ? ) at the beginning of the 17th century . I would advise Mr. Leigh to read Egon Erwin Kisch 's " In Search of Golem , " though I am not sure that it was ever translated into English . JOHN H. KRAUS Middle Village , N. Y. To the Editor : As a Czech emigre , I was very touched reading Michael Leigh 's article on Prague @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of " Vltava " both for the river running through Prague , as well as for Smetana 's symphonic poem . Usually in both instances it is referred to as Moldau , which is the German translation . RENEE REIMAN Scarsdale , N. Y. To the Editor : I found the article about Prague very moving . It brought back wonderful and nostalgic memories of my visits to Prague in the late 1960 's . But one interesting item which I thought should have been highlighted is the Hebrew clock on the tower of the Jewish Town Hall . Although reference was made to this clock in the article , it is unique in that it is the only clock in the world that runs counter-clockwise . RABBI BERNARD ZLOTOWITZ Tenafly , N. J. LITTLE COMPTON To the Editor : In the story , " Why Little Compton Has Lasted SO Long " ( Travel Section , June 15 ) , the tale of the town 's taverns and crossroads was misinterpreted . The reasdn there are no crossroads in Little Compton is that the town fathers planned it that way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only be erected at a crossroads , and the town fathers wanted no taverns in the town , they eliminated all crossroads . Instead , any road running into a perpendicular road stops ; several yards along the intersecting road , another road continues in the original direction . LESLIE HORNIG Providence , R.I. LA BELLE FRANCE To the Editor : My husband and I recently returned from 22 days in France and we were amazed how courteous we found the French to be . Everyone was helpful , always eager to aid us and always with a smile . If they could not direct us , they said so with an apology . Not once did we encounter a rude person . In three separate occasions we asked directions and had . young men tell us to follow them in their car and then they got out and told us what direction to take . Never have we had this happen in America . We had a superb trip and hope this will help anyone who is afraid of traveling in France . LOUISE WOLTERS Salisbury , Md . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as many as possible . The large volume of mail , however , prevents the editors from acknowledging or returning letters .
