For seven months , the White House and leading congressional Democrats have fought a bitter and seemingly endless battle over the future of energy policy in the U.S. Spurred on by Senator Henry M. Jackson and other presidential hopefuls , the Democrats sought to lower oil and gas costs by legislating a rollback of prices to levels far below those set by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries . For his part , President Ford believed that only an eventual decontrol of prices-which would mean higher consumer costs-would encourage energy conservation , provide an adequate incentive for increased domestic oil production and ultimately render the U.S. less dependent on foreign oil supplies . <P> After Congress in July rejected the White House proposal for phased decontrol the President vowed to veto a congressional bill that provided for a six-month extension of present price controls , due to expire on Aug. 31 . That action would have plunged the nation into abrupt decontrol , with definite inflationary dangers . Faced with that prospect , late last week both the Administration and its Democratic opponents abruptly pulled back from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Senate Majority Leader Mike Mansfield and House Speaker Carl Albert , Ford agreed to give Mansfield time to investigate support in the Senate for compromise legislation that would eventually phase out restrictions . Ford promised that if prospects for phased decontrol still seem promising this week , he will agree to a further extension of controls for 30 days or more to allow time for legislation to be prepared . <P> For months the Administration , which strongly advocated phased decontrol , had played down the possible impact of rising petroleum prices . But then came the resurgence of inflation in July , sending consumer prices soaring upward at an annual rate of 15.4% . That deeply impressed some of Ford 's White House advisers , who were fully aware that rising petroleum costs were a prime cause of the price surge . The advisers also became increasingly worried that the looming shortages of natural gas , which supplies a third of the nation 's energy needs , might trigger a stampede of industries to switch to oil , adding to upward pressures on its price . <P> All along , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impact of decontrol on prices . Arthur Okun , a member of TIME 'S Board of Economists , warned that decontrol would add one point to the inflation rate and that the price rise OPEC is expected to announce soon may add another . Last week the pessimists drew some support from an unexpected source : a major oil company . In a widely noted letter to congressmen , Mobil Chairman Rawleigh Warner Jr . said that sudden decontrol might be " a shock " to the recovery and could slash consumer buying power by as much as $8 billion-well above the Administration 's estimate of $5.3 billion . <P> If the Administration and the congressional Democrats fail to agree on a gradual phaseout of controls this time around , the nation could be in for a possibly painful test of just how sharp the shock of immediate decontrol could be .
