Drug runners easily elude police in Florida Keys <P> In the past three years , the smuggling of drugs from Latin America has become Florida 's growth industry , a multibillion-dollar business involving private airlines and speedboats , Mafia connections and high-priced lawyers . Arrayed against them is the collective might of the U.S. Customs Service , the Coast Guard and the Drug Enforcement Administration , as well as local lawmen . The good guys are clearly losing the battle . Last year Feds in the Southeast seized roughly 1.4 million lbs . of marijuana , with a street value of $420 million , and 533 lbs . of cocaine worth $133 million . But perhaps ten times that amount got through . A pound of marijuana costs $40 in Colombia and brings $500 in New York . Says Don Turnbaugh , chief of Customs patrol in Miami : " The situation is out of control . We 're fighting at best a holding action . To think of stopping them is absurd . " <P> TIME Correspondent Richard Woodbury reports from the scene : <P> <P> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Florida 's 1,200-mile coastline , along back-country roads and at dirt airstrips . Fishermen churning home to Miami through the Cape Florida channel may be startled to find a white Customs launch bearing down on them . Blue-shirted men with bolstered revolvers play a high-intensity beam through cabins and scan decks with night-vision goggles . Near by on the Miami River , other officers crouch in a thicket of weeds , training binoculars on a rusting banana boat , watching for seamen debarking with suspicious packages . To the south at Key Largo , deputy sheriffs with high-powered rifles cruise through mangrove swamps , on the prowl for marijuana runners . <P> For a time , pot runners virtually owned the place , bringing to real life the <P> Key Largo of Bogart and Bacall . They hacked their own roads through the mosquito-ridden mangrove , sealed them off with padlocked gates , and even staked out a sheriffs substation with a walkie-talkie lookout to learn of patrols . But lately the police have regained the initiative . <P> As Sergeant Robert Brack , 29 , edged his maroon sedan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vans . Suddenly there was a roar of boat engines and rifle fire . Pinned down , Brack held off the attackers until help came . Two shrimp boats packed with pot ran aground in the confusion . Surrounded in the thicket , a gang of eleven men was captured , along with $14 million in grass . <P> The smugglers spend heavily for good equipment , whereas " Customs , " as one of them puts it , " have to go to Congress just to get an airplane . " Indeed , the Feds ' best material comes from what they have confiscated from smugglers . Three of Customs ' aging Florida fleet of eight planes are trophies of pot busts . <P> The Feds boast more than 100 boats , but the fastest Coast Guard launch will travel only 28 m.p.h . The smugglers ' sleek ocean racers , stripped of galleys and bunks for greater capacity , can do 50 m.p.h. fully loaded . " We are outmanned and outrun , " says Coast Guard Commander John Ikens . " They have more money than we do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
