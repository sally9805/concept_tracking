Jun. /Feb. ' 77 In Rome something new in contem- porary history was happening : the rise of Fascism . I wanted to find out what it was all about . Is there not almost inevitably , 1 began to wonder , a turning point in the affairs of a revolutionary government , whether of the Right or the Left , which has come to power in a land , though it has had to share some of that power with other groups , a moment early in its life when its fate hangs in the balance and it either goes under or survives by the skin of its teeth and takes advantage of its luck by destroying its enemies and making its power absolute ? It was easy to recall examples of the first , of governments that failed to hold on : several in France after the great revolution of 1789 until Napoleon took over and made himself emperor and dictator ; some in Europe after the liberal uprisings of 1848 ; and more lately at the end of the Great War , of which the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regime , which replaced Kerensky , was a recent example of the second . Though it constituted a minority among the parties that helped to overthrow the Czar , it had held on , smashed its opposition by trickery or force and established its Communist dictatorship . In Rome I began to see that Mussolini had successfully passed through that trial in the years just previous and that he had turned what looked like almost certain defeat and ouster from office as Prime Minister into a victory that soon led to his dictatorship . The forces of Italian democracy , divided though they were , had almost succeeded in maintaining a free country and in sinking the Fascist leader and his movement . But , as later in Germany and for the same reasons  --  their irresolution and sheer stupidity  --  they had let their chance slip by . In Italy it had taken the murder of just one man to precipitate the crisis and then to turn the trick . How was this possible ? How had it happened ? In the weeks that followed I spent most of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was my first experience with Fascism . One could see at once the awful cost to a civilized people of having their freedoms trampled upon . But how , I wondered , had these roughneck black-shifted Fascists , with their castor-oil squads and their bullyboys , of whom Mussolini was the foremost , got away with it ? And in one of Europe 's oldest and most sophisticated societies . The turning point , it became increasingly clear , the more I delved into the story , had come with the murder of the Socialist deputy Giacomo Matteotti by Fascist thugs . Son of a wealthy landowner from the Po valley , Matteotti , like so many youths of his class , had early embraced Socialism , been a comrade , though not a friend , of Mussolini 's in the early days of the Socialist Party before the war , eventually studied law and entered Parliament as a Socialist deputy in 1919 . From the beginning of Fascism he had been its implacable enemy , denouncing in the Chamber its terror and corruption , even when it had come to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In a tumultuous session of the Chamber Mussolini ( center foreground ) took control of the Italian government step by fatal step . He disarmed Church opposition by settling a territorial dispute with the Vatican . by William LSIiirer Twentieth Century Journey by William L. Shires , Simon and Schuster , New York , 1976. on the afternoon of May 30 , 1924 , with inkwells and other objects being hurled about like hand grenades and the deputies scuffling in the aisles , Matteotti had stood at the rostrum for two hours patiently expounding , when he could be heard , on how the recent elections had been rigged to give the Fascists a majority , how opposition candidates had been murdered or beaten , their meetings broken up , their newspapers suppressed , and how the ballot boxes had been stuffed by Blackshirt ruffians . All through the speech and at its end the Fascist deputies hurled insults at the speaker and threats against his life . Matteotti was not unmindful of them . Turning to a colleague as he took his seat he said : " Now you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days later he was dead . Mussolini himself had sat through Matteo tti ' s speech silent but livid with rage . Back at his office he told his hench-men that something would " have to he done " about Matte-otti . He could not be allowed to make another such speech . The more rug-ged of his followers needed no further encouragement . On the afternoon of June 10 , while Matteotti was walking from his home to catch a streetcar to the Chamber , he was seized by six men , overpowered after a fierce struggle , pushed bleeding into an automobile and stabbed to death . That evening , under cover of darkness , his body was thrown into a shallow grave in the woods of Quartarella , fourteen miles Continued on page 88 MaNesollartall continued from page 71 north of Rome , and abandoned . The leader of the murder squad was typical of those who wormed their way up to the inner circles of Fascism . He was Amerigo Dumini , a St. Louis gangster , who had returned to the land of his ancestors after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fascists . He openly boasted that he had carried out eleven " homicides . " The others were Fascist scum , all with prison records for violent crimes . For them the elimination of Matteotti had been just another assignment . Before the night was over they were boasting of the deed and Mussolini was informed of what had taken place . But for several days he feigned ignorance . When Matteotti 's wife called on him two days later and begged that her husband be returned to her , " dead or alive , " he assured her that there was nothing to worry about and that he was certain her husband would soon be back . To the Chamber the same day he said that the police were diligently searching for the " missing deputy " and that he hoped " that Deputy Matteotti will shortly be able to resume his seat in Parliament . " The assassins had left too many clues for the police to cover up thecrime for very long . The blood-soaked automobile had been found the next day parked at the Ministry of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was about to leave Rome . In his suitcase were found the bloodstained trousers of Matteotti . The newspapers were ordered to suppress news of the discoveries but word soon leaked out and there was a violent revulsion throughout the country . In Milan and other cities thousands of party members in public demonstrations hurled their party cards into the gutters . When Mussolini tried to mobilize his Fascist militia , most of its members refused to report for duty . On June 13 all the opposition deputies save the Communists walked out of the Chamber and proclaimed that they would not return until Matteotti 's abductors had been caught and brought to trial and law and order restored . They appealed to the King to dismiss Mussolini and form a new government . They called themselves the new Aventine , recalling the hill to which once in Roman times the plebeians had withdrawn in protest against the usurpation of their rights by the upper classes . They met separately and protested and protested . But that was all . The little King was of no help , nor was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was barely five feet tall  --  had been largely responsible forinflicting Mussolini on the country in the first place . Frightened by the postwar chaos and fearing a takeover by the Socialists , it had been he who had called Mussolini to power on October 28 , 1922 . Unmindful of the fact that most of the disorder in Italy that fall was caused by the Fascists , who were mobilizing their militia , seizing key centers in many cities and taking over trains for the March on Rome , he had paid no attention to the assurance of his Army Chief of Staff , General Pietro Badoglio , that " five minutes of machine-gun fire will scatter that Fascist ' rabble . " When the government declared a state of siege and directed the Army to put down the Fascist shock troops , the King refused to sign the proclamation . Instead he wired Mussolini in Milan to hurry to Rome and form a government . Now in 1924 , two years later . though disliking the rowdiness of the Fascists , he was pleased that they had restored " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power with the traditional parties . Mussolini , despite his threats , had not yet made himself dictator . His Fascists held only four of fourteen Cabinet posts . Parliament functioned . There was constitutional govern . ment and freedom of speech and of the press , more or less , despite the Blackshirt terror . But the murder of Matteotti had provoked a sudden crisis . Later Mussolini would admit that it was the greatest crisis of his regime  --  until toward the end , when Fascism began to crumble under the strain of a losing war . For days the Duce was panic-stricken . The party was falling apart . There were angry demonstrations under the window of his office in the Chigi Palace . He knew that the opposition parties were pressing the King to throw him out and he feared the monarch might give in . But this was to overestimate the courage of Victor Emmanuel . When the deputies of the Aventine called on him , produced evidence of Mussolini 's complicity in the murder of Matteotti and demanded his dismissal , he turned a deaf ear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , two weeks after the disappearance of the Socialist deputy , had given Mussolini an overwhelming vote of confidence , with Benedetto Croce , the revered philosopher and himself a senator , applauding the result . Furthermore , the King reminded the opposition deputies , in the Chamber itself Italy 's three venerable former Prime Ministers , Orlando , Giolitti and Salandra , all of them Liberals , had declared their support for the shaky Mussolini . Even after August 16 , when Matteotti 's butchered remains were found by an alert police officer , and a new cry for Mussolini 's ouster rose from one end of the country to another , the King would not budge . The opposition parties had been con // 90 J a n. /Feb. ' 77 fident that this time he would , if only out of a sense of revulsion at a crime carried out by his own government . When the King turned them down they were at a loss as to what to do next . They never got another chance . Mussolini , sensing their hesitation and irresolution , recovered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1925 , he delivered a speech in the Chamber which , as I now read it more than three years later , seemed to me to pronounce the end of any semblance of democratic , constitutional government and the beginning of the totalitarian , one-party police state . Emboldened by the failure of the opposition to get him when he was down , he now proudly proclaimed his responsibility for all that had taken place . " If Fascism has become a criminal association , " he said , " I am its leader . " If force was necessary to ensure Italy 's " tranquility " he would employ it . " Rest assured , " he concluded , " that in the next forty-eight hours the situation will be clarified . " It was , though it took the next three years , the period just prior to my arrival , to complete the job fully . Opposition political parties and press were suppressed , as was freedom of speech and assembly . Special courts were set up to try political offenders and a secret police was established @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1944 , shortly before his own execution at the hands of partisans : " By my action of January 3 , 1925 , with the suppression of all parties , the bases were laid for the totalitarian state . " Well , at least he knew what he wanted , and given the shocking disarray of the forces of democracy , he knew how to get it . " Law and order " were restored . " Social peace " prevailed . The trains began to run on time . From abroad foreign dignitaries applauded . In England the Archbishop of Canterbury began to see the strutting Italian dictator as " the one giant figure in Europe " and even Winston Churchill , the Chancellor of the Exchequer , was taken in . Meeting Mussolini in Rome shortly before my arrival he hailed him as a great European leader and especially for his " struggle against the bestial appetites of Leninism . " At home the banker Otto Kahn said of Mussolini : " The world owes him a debt of gratitude . " And Thomas Edison thought him " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were let off . At a trial in 1926 in the remote village of Chieti , far removed from Rome , where passions might easily have caused trouble , two defendants were acquitted and Dumini and two others were found guilty of " manslaughter without premeditation " and sentenced to six years in prison . Two months later Mussolini pardoned them and they were released from prison . So far as the government was concerned the case was over . Murder had paid off . Mussolini had used it to make himself dictator . On October 28 , 1928 , the anniversary of the " March on Rome , " I went down to the Piazza Venezia to hear the Duce address the multitude . It was the first but by no means the last speech I would hear him make over the years . Some of the foreign correspondents in Rome thought he was the finest orator in Europe . but I was disappointed . The pitch of his voice was too high and the pace of his words too feverish . He screamed at his listeners . You could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ born actor . After an explosive phrase he would jut out his chin , throw back his head and wait for the roar of applause , which he obviously loved . Then as he swung back into his rolling , turgid periods he would flail his arms . The gestures seemed to be overdone and somewhat ridiculous . But the crowd was obviously fired by them and by the torrent of screeching words . There was no doubt that he was an artful manipulator of the masses . He not only swayed them with his oratory but also , I knew , with his fiery journalistic writing . He had developed his skills as a young Socialist leader before the war . As the youthful editor of Avanti , the Socialist daily in Milan , he soon proved to be the best journalistic writer in the revolutionary movement and quickly built up the circulation and prestige of the newspaper . He had broken with the party over the question of Italian intervention in the war , which he favored , had been expelled and had then gone off to the front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Socialists when the war was over , he had founded the anti-Socialist Fascist movement in Milan as an outlet for his immense energies , and somewhat to his surprise had seen it mushroom in the chaos of the postwar world . Intelligent and widely read in history , whose lessons he thought he understood , he had known how to profit from the confusion and despair which prevailed in the twentieth century . But he was flawed , I thought . He strutted too much . He was too bellicose . He was much too ambitious not only for himself but for his country . Now that he was dictator he seemed to envisage himself as a modern Caesar who would restore to Italy the glory of Rome . He allowed himself to be carried too far away to realize that Italy simply lacked the natural resources to become a great , imperial power , which in our time depended upon industrial strength , and that the Italian people , moreover , were too civilized , too down to earth , to be interested in his ambitions , which they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to besure , were learning how to profit from the regime . They were relieved to be free from the threat of socialism and strikes . The always conservative and backward peasants apparently supported him . But the bulk of Italians , most of the middle class and all of the workers ( and al most all of the intellectuals ) , so far as I could see , did not take Fascism very seriously . They were too intel ligent for that . They suffered it but seemed to be sure that it would not last very long , that it was a passing phase . They had passed through so many periods of aberration in their long and colorful history . As an Italian historian , who had been ousted from his university chair , put it to me one day , behind th &; fa  --  ade of Fascism there was only emptiness , and inside Mussolini 's strutting figure there was only sawdust . I turned up one important story that would soon mark a turning point in the history of both the Vatican and Fascist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be solved . It was an old problem , going back to 1870 , and it had plagued both the Holy See and the Kingdom of Italy ever since . By 1870 , with the capture of Rome , Italian armies of the Risorgimento had completed the conquest of the old Papal States which had begun in 1859 . Rome was proclaimed the capital of reunited Italy under the House of Savoy . The centuries-old temporal reign of the popes came to an end . But Pius IX refused to acknowledge it . He refused to recognize the new kingdom or its government . He declared himself " a prisoner in the Vatican " and neither he nor his successors had set foot outside its narrow confines since . Cavour , the chief architect of the reunited country , had sought before his death in 1861 to negotiate with the Vatican , offering it financial compensation for its loss of territory and a guarantee of the sovereignty of Vatican City , but the Pope had refused to talk to him . For fifty-eight years the Roman Question had remained unsolved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the attitude of the Vatican began to change . The Church welcomed the advent of Fascism because it believed it might save Italy from anarchy and from being taken over by Socialists or Communists . But it had two doubts . The first was about the Duce himself , who in his Socialist years had thundered against the Church , preached atheism , proclaimed that " Christ is dead and his teachings moribund , " and even in the first years of building up the Fascist movement had insisted on the party 's taking a stand against the Church , calling for the confiscation of its ecclesiastical property The second doubt was whether the Fascist regime would be stable enough to last and thus be worth negotiating with . As to the latter , // the Vatican had a problem of its own . One of the main threats to Mussolini 's continuing in office came from a political party which the Vatican itself had helped form after the war . This was the Catholic Popular Party , led by a brilliant Sicilian priest , Don Sturzo . By 1922 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had 107 deputies in the Chamber , which made it the second largest , after the Socialists , in the nation . And had allied itself with the democratic opposition , including the Socialists , against Fascism . This presented a dilemma to the Church . The new Popular Party , thanks largely to the magnetism of Don Sturzo , had won over a considerable part of the masses and thus constituted a political bulwark against the Socialists . But it was democratic and opposed to Fascism , which the Vatican was now leaning toward . Three months after becoming Prime Minister , Mussolini had made his first overtures to the Holy See . He had met secretly with Cardinal Pietro Gasparri , the veteran Papal Secretary of State , and made clear that he wanted a solution to the Roman Question which would be acceptable to the Pope . Not only the Socialists but the Catholic party , he observed , stood in the way of setting up a " stable " government that could negotiate a lasting agreement . This difficulty , so far as it concerned the Popular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ June , 1923 , the Pope ordered Don Sturzo , as a priest , to resign his leadership of the party and cease political activity . This doomed the Catholic party , and it soon began to lose strength . Mussolini , encouraged by this move of the Vatican , had begun further talks with it that had stretched out ever since . In the meantime he took certain steps to make clear that , whatever he had said in the past , he now wished to restore the Church 's position in Italy and to encourage the Catholic religion throughout the land . The one-time atheist and archfoe of the Church hastily had his children baptized . Then he arranged for a religious wedding to his wife , whom he had married years before in a civil ceremony . Guardedly he began to speak well of the Church , which previously he had so vilified . More openly he urged Italians to pay more attention to religion . He ordered the crucifix , which the Risorgimento had banished from state schools and hospitals , restored . He allotted large sums @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the war . The Vatican took appreciative notice . Leading prelates commenced to send out friendly signals . Certain cardinals made public statements lauding the Duce for ridding Italy of " the threat of Bolshevism . " In 1926 , just after the banning of all the opposition democratic parties , including the Catholic Pop-ular Party , negotiations between the Vatican and Mussolini were stepped up . Though they were conducted in the greatest secrecy , 1 learned that the parties , then working on the fifteenth draft , were nearing agreement . It was signed in Rome a couple of months after I left , on February 11,1929 . Vatican City was recognized as an independent , sovereign state . Though with only 110 acres of territory , and therefore the smallest in the world , it was also one of the most powerful . The Italian government agreed to pay the Holy See $50 million as compensation for the loss of the Papal States . It recognized the Church as the official church in Italy and Roman Catholicism as the official religion . It agreed to make its laws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instruction obligatory in the public schools , religious marriages compulsory and divorce illegal . The Church thus was given back its old place and power in Italy and its political sovereignty in the world . In recompense the Vatican recognized the Kingdom of Italy and its Fascist government as the temporal power in the country and agreed to keep the Church out of politics . For Mussolini it was the greatest success of his career . Not only in Italy but abroad he was hailed by Catholics and non-Catholics alike for his statesmanship . Catholics rejoiced that he had freed the Pope from his " imprisonment " and made the Holy See a sovereign state , to which the nations of the world could now send their diplomats and receive the Pope 's envoys in return . Pope Pius IX himself praised the Duce extravagantly , as a man sent by Divine Providence . I left Rome at the end of 1928 with mixed feelings . I loved the old city , its antiquities which recalled so much of history , its pink and yellow walls , however crumbling , its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light , especially at sunset , the sound of its church bells that pealed the day long , and the lovely hills around . It had fastened its nobility and charm on me for good , and I would return from time to time to the end of my life . But the takeover of such a beautiful and civilized country by Mussolini and his rowdies clouded the picture and depressed one . Democracy here was dead . The present and the immediate future , at least , belonged to Fascism . This was a bleak prospect for such a sunny people . Was Fascism the wave of the future , as some here and abroad thought , and as Anne Lindbergh would predict a decade later when the Nazi brand was riding high in Germany ? I could not believe it  --  not in the long run . The Italians on the whole were more patient about it than I , with my raw , Yankee impulsiveness . They had a better sense of history than I had as yet developed . They said to you : " This too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
