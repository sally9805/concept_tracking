" I work like a gardener , " said Joan Mir some years ago in one of his infrequent interviews . He was alluding to his habit of steady work , moving from ceramics to painting , from sculpture to lithography , as one might turn from picking the lettuces to watering the celery . Today , in his 82nd year , he continues to do so , ensconced in the enormous white studio his friend and fellow Catalan , the architect Jos Luis Sert , built for him on the island of Mallorca in 1956 . Mird lives near by , among his peas , vines and carobs , in a house cluttered by found objects and rustic earthenware . He has been married to the same wife , Pilar Juncosa , since 1929 ; and in his manner of life and patterns of work ( up at 6:30 a.m. to paint , never a day without a line ) he is the epitome of industrious respectability . <P> " The more I work , the more I want to work , " he says , recalling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been a reclusive figure . The stubby squared-off head above the plain business suit could belong to any Barcelona merchant . What has issued from that head is a different matter : despite many trivial or self-parodying works , Mir is the last of the great stylists of early modern art , the most poetic and formally gifted of all the surrealists . His imagination , filled with juicy ironies and wry eroticism , has enriched generations of younger artists , including Pollock and Calder . <P> Column and Hawser . The present retrospective in Paris , of Mir 's work , organized by the French Ministry of Cultural Affairs at the Grand Palais ( through Oct. 13 ) , is for all practical purposes definitive . It contains some 350 works , including last year 's sculptures and beginning with early cubist-influenced paintings . One striking example is the superb Nude with a Mirror-solid as a column with those interlocking planes of pink flesh , the Khmer eyes , the thick hawser of plaited hair , and perched on a hassock whose needlepoint butterfly sums up Mir 's pleasure in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is one of the three great modern artists Spain has produced . Both Picasso and Gris immersed themselves in the cosmopolitan culture of Paris . They became European rather than " Spanish " artists . But , as Mir pointed out in a letter to a friend , he remained " an international Catalan . " Mir without Catalonia would no longer be Mir . <P> Once the eye gets used to the quirks and secrecies of his inimitable shorthand , it discovers how deeply regional an artist he was . His leanest years were in Paris in the early ' 20s when , he claimed later , he was obliged to live on dried figs and use the hallucinations caused by hunger to loosen up his imagery . Even then Mir managed to raise the money to journey back to his family village of Montroig , a community of farmers and peasant craftsmen , where he spent six months of every year .
