BUBBLING BROWN SUGAR <P> " The blacker the berry , the sweet er the juice , " Louis Armstrong often said . " Brown sugar " was a term of en dearment for chorus girls in Harlem in the ' 20s and ' 30s . Both sweet and sizzling , this loosely structured show is a song and dance ramble . During the edgy militant ' 60s , any black who danced was regarded as a toe-tapping Uncle Tom , and any black who sang was regarded as an evangelical sponge . What a treat it is to see blacks singing and dancing as if those skills were not blemishes on intellect or race but blessings of body and voice . <P> The book is for the wastebasket . A young black couple is taken on a tour down memory lane by three canny professionals ( Avon Long , Josephine Premice and Joseph Attles ) who are old but ageless . But there is no frost on their bones . This show comes from the tor rid zone . <P> The dancers are expert stylists . The songs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rehearing It Do n't Mean a Thing , Sophisticated Lady and Solitude , one realizes that in Ellington we lost not a duke but a king . <P> While much of Bubbling Brown Sug ar is saturated with nostalgia , one girl in it , Vivian Reed , has the fresh , flaming force of a new comet entering the earth 's orbit . Her movement is sinuous , her presence is magnetic , her voice is torchy . Sans Con Edison , she could light up a Broadway marquee . <P> T.E . Kalem
