Book by PETER STONE <P> Music by JULE STYNE <P> Lyrics by BOB MERRILL <P> This Sugar is not organic . It has been so thoroughly processed , refined and filtered that it has lost the natural energy that makes a good musical strong and healthy . <P> The story line is rather faithfully adapted from the Billy Wilder-I.A.L . Diamond film , Some Like It Hot . Two Depression-era musicians ( Robert Morse and Tony Roberts ) inadvertently witness the St. Valentine 's Day massacre in Chicago . Scurrying for cover , they don women 's dress and sign on with an all-girl band headed for Miami . Neither Morse nor Roberts tries to be a female impersonator . They are clearly men attempting , with no little difficulty , to masquerade as women . Thus the show relies not on drag jokes but adjustment-crisis humor-how to cope with broken straps on padded bras or keep one 's ankles straight on high heels . <P> Nature 's Geometry . What is dated about the humor is the display of rabbity virility that Morse and Roberts have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and dangerously inaccessible as Farmer McGregor 's lettuce patch . The one who captures Tony Roberts ' fancy is Sugar Kane ( Elaine Joyce ) , the band 's singer and a lovely tribute to nature 's geometry who would have made Euclid blink . Sugar is keen on meeting a millionaire . In a twinkling , Roberts returns to manhood , sprouts a yachting outfit , flashes a Wall Street Journal and woos away . <P> Morse , to his initial dismay , is pursued by a bona fide rich senior gentleman ( Cyril Ritchard ) . As Morse dances with Ritchard , comes to enjoy being courted and finally announces that he is engaged , the show achieves both its most comic and affecting peak . On a high order of miming , virtually la Marceau , Morse captures the tremor , tenderness , coquettishness and vulnerability of a girl 's first love . Morse is an enormously personable stage presence , and he knows it . The trouble is that he gratuitously does twice what he has perfectly done once . He is a child of excess and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> High Gloss . As a choreographer , Champion is admirably disciplined . The execution is flawless , but Champion 's dance imagination is rigid . He favors locomotive choreography in which the chorus chug-chug-chugs around and occasionally wigwags its outstretched arms semaphore-fashion . This is fine for motion , but scanty of meaning . The dances could be inserted in another musical , where they would mean no more and no less than they do in Sugar . <P> If hummable songs are a plus , Jule Styne 's songs are hummable , though you may not know quite which homogenized number you are humming . As for Bob Merrill 's lyrics , they are the labored products of a man hovering over a rhyming dictionary . Sugar is almost a textbook case of a musical born after its time . It may well enjoy great wads of audience favor . But in the past three years , Company and Follies have altered the critical perspective by providing a musical form that is spare , intelligent , ironic , mature and capable of sustaining three-dimensional characters . <P> This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is irrevocably doomed , but it must have a singular mood , manner and meaning all its own . Otherwise , all that remains , as Sugar indicates , is a sterile display of high-gloss techniques . T.E . Kalem
