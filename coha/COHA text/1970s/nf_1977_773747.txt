txt // generations of critics , up to the present day , who certainly have not attributed divine authority to any particular style , nevertheless have gone on believing in the possibility of a way of building that was not artificial , not marked by human imperfections , and that represented some inescapable reality . Of course Pugin himself was not really committed for a moment to the full implications of that French rationalism which lies behind his claim in True Principles that we should not use artificial ' means to make buildings look better than they are in reality ' . Indeed , later in the same book he flatly contradicts himself when he writes : One of the great arts of architecture is to render a building more vast and lofty in appearance than it is in reality . ' ' Pugin loved Gothic : he loved the Catholic Church : he decided that the one was the permanent embodiment of the other . Here , indeed , was pure function raised to the level of religious truth . Yet critics have taken his espousal of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Phoebe Stanton published an article in 1954 called Pugin : Principles of Design versus Revivalism ' which implies that , driven by a need to find a rational system of building construction , he hit on Gothic as the perfect answer . ' In fact the development of his mind was the reverse of this . Driven by a passionate love of Gothic he seized on any and every argument which might be used to justify its revival , though the argument from religious truth and from functional or technological necessity took precedence over any aesthetic arguments . One of the arguments he hit on was based not in rationalism but in nationalism . This was fraught with consequences for the nineteenth and twentieth centuries . He argued that in consequence of the deplorable stylistic variety of late neoClassical architecture with its Greek , Roman , and even Oriental revivals , national feelings and national architecture are at so low an ebb , that it becomes an absolute duty in every Englishman to attempt their revival ' .9 It is one of the curiosities of the history of taste to find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adoption of a style of French origin as part of a recovery of nationalist feeling in England . Elsewhere he stated that the erection of the Parliament Houses in the national style is by far the greatest advance that has yet been // gained in the right direction ' .10 This nationalist argument also shows the arbitrariness of those who justify aesthetic choices by extraneous arguments . Although in espousing the cause of nationalism he felt obliged to condemn Regency Picturesque , elsewhere he upholds the doctrines of the late Picturesque theorists and offers them as though he had discovered them himself . Thus , echoing the writings of Price and Knight , he declares : The picturesque effect of the ancient buildings results from the ingenious methods by which the old builders overcame local and constructive difficulties . An edifice which is arranged with the principal view of looking picturesque is sure to resemble an artificial waterfall or a madeup rock , which are generally so unnaturally natural as to appear ridiculous . An architect should exhibit his skill by turning the difficulties which occur in raising an elevation from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But all these modern inconsistencies have arisen from this great error , ? the plans of buildings are designed to suit the elevation , instead of the elevation being made subservient to the plan . u But arguments like these can mean whatever one wants them to mean , can be used to defend or attack whatever one has decided one likes or dislikes . Though Pugin borrowed them from the theorists of the Picturesque , he would not allow that they justified Picturesque architecture . The way in which Nash allowed all manner of accidents to influence the form and layout of his Regent Street and Regent 's Park development , rather than imposing a symmetrical intellectual scheme , is today acknowledged as a triumph of Picturesque planning . All Pugin could see , however , were those nests of monstrosities , the Regent 's Park and Regent Street , where all kinds of styles are jumbled together to make up a mass ' .12 Two years after True Principles came another similar work , An Apology for the Revival of Christian Architecture in England ( 1843 ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his title that Christian means Gothic , so confident is he of the success of his earlier propaganda . He does feel obliged to explain why , if Gothic is the permanent and divinely appointed style for Christians , it was not developed till several centuries after the crucifixion of our Lord ' .13 Needless to say he can offer no explanation that will satisfy anyone who has not // already decided for quite other reasons that Gothic is the best style . Similarly , he feels that something is required of him concerning the applicability of Gothic to new building requirements such as railway stations . He illustrates its suitability by contrasing two drawings of railway bridges sporting Gothic arches and mouldings , with two drawings based on the despised Euston Station , one of which shows in a lamentably crude and inaccurate fashion the celebrated Greek Doric entrance gateway . Even the trains respond to the improved ' architecture : while the engine at Euston disfigures the station with clouds of smoke and steam , an engine in the Gothic station allows itself no more than a few Picturesque @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nineteenth century Gothic enjoyed some special appropriateness or propriety ' for church design , it is hard to see on what grounds it could enjoy the same appropriateness for railway architecture . In fact the only possible justification for using it was that Pugin liked the Gothic style best and could not be satisfied until everything was made to conform to that . M. R. James understood the mentality when he made the Verger in An Episode of Cathedral History ' lament the destruction of Georgian woodwork in the choir of Southminster Cathedral with the words : But Dean Burscough he was very set on the Gothic period , and nothing would serve him but everything must be made agreeable to that . ' ' ' That the bold and dramatic Euston Arch , so much admired today , was a particular bete noire to Pugin serves to emphasize that his theory of convenience , construction , or propriety ' means only what the individual decides it is going to mean . Thus , while Pugin would justify a spire on the grounds that it had a symbolical function or purpose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Euston similarly fulfilled a symbolical role : for him it was no more than a striking proof of the utter disregard paid by architects to the purposes of the building they are called upon to design ' . ls We have argued that Pugin 's writings lent support to those who believed in a way of building that was not artificial , not marked by human imperfections and that represented some inescapable reality ' . Pugin hints at such an architecture when he states that a pointed building is a natural building ' , and // that I trust , before long , to produce a treatise on Natural Architecture ' .16 In such a treatise we would doubtless have been told frequently that every building that is treated naturally without disguise or concealment can not fail to look well ' , 17 though we could be equally certain that we would never be allowed to stray far from Pugin 's belief that the beauty of architectural design depended on its being the expression of what the building required , and that for Christians that expression could only be correctly given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a natural architecture , so inevitable that its forms should not be open to question , has long outlasted the belief that it had already been achieved in Gothic . Pugin 's mode of argument adum-brated the tendency which has been widespread since his time to deny or falsify the role of aesthetic motivation and to claim instead guidance from considerations of naturalness ' , utility , functional advantage , and social , moral , and political necessity , or simply from correspondence with the spirit of the age ' . 2 . VIOLLET-LE-DUC Should anyone attempt to construct a theory of modern architecture in harmony with the conditions of thought pre-vailing today , he will discover no starting point so firm , no back-ground so solid as that provided by Eugene Viollet-le-Duc. ' 18 So Summerson wrote in 1949 in the first of two essays which argued that with all their strengths and weaknesses Viollet-le-Duc 's writings were the basis of modern architecture . The essence of Viollet 's Dictionnaire raisonne de l'architecture francaise du XIe au XVIe siecle ( ten volumes , 1854 ? 61 ) was that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ archi-tecture had a functional or technological origin and justifica-tion . He derived this from the French tradition of rationalist architectural theory from Cordemoyt to Rondelet , which we have referred to elsewhere , and used it to justify propaganda // for a new nineteenth-century architecture that would be based on a scientific exposition of Gothic . These principles were given clearer and more readable exposition in the two volumes of his Entretiens sur l'architecture published from 1858 to 1872 . On the first page of Volume I the vital question is asked , what are the social conditions under which art best flourishes , Is man in becoming civilised , refined , tolerant , moderate in his tastes , and well-informed , ? such in fact as our social conditions can make him , ? thereby rendered more apt and capable in the domain of Art ? ' The answer is a resounding No ' : Philosophy , gentle manners , justice , and politeness constitute a state of society in which it is agreeable to live ; but this state may be unfavourable to the development of Art.i19 He therefore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ element in which it originates and flourishes ' , and that to estimate the value of art which may have been highly developed and perfected under a very imperfect civilization ' we must adopt laws which belong exclusively to the Arts , are are independent of the state of civilization to which nations may attain ' .20 This calm and lucid approach , so French in its air of detachment , is very different from German Kulturgeschichte and from the social commitment ' of twentieth-century architects and their defenders . So why does Summerson imply that Viollet-le-Duc will somehow be found to be in harmony with the conditions of thought prevailing today ' ? The answer is that once he gets into the body of his book Viollet soon drops his quiet detached air and it becomes clear that he has a very determined view of the only kind of society which can produce good art : it is secular , egalitarian , rationalist , and progressive . Moreover , he begins to rely on a belief in the Zeitgeist to explain away his dislike of Roman and eighteenth-century architecture as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This lands him in difficulties with Gothic architecture which he is forced to explain not as an expression of the feudal and monastic Zeitgeist but as an attack on it . As a great force for good in society , architecture is too serious to have anything to do with style or the caprices of that fantastical queen we call Fashion ; for when it becomes // the plaything of a people without fixed ideas or convictions , and when no longer reflecting national Manners and Customs , it is but an encumbrance , ? a thing of mere curiosity or luxury ' .21 Once the Queen of Fashion with her wayward individual tastes has been deposed , Viollet-le-Duc will be there ready to set up the republic of fixed ideas . For him everything must be reducible to , and explicable in terms of , reason . Consequently for him , style depends only on the application to an object of the reasoning faculty ' , 22 and all buildings are good if they show evidence of rationalist com-position , bad if they do not . To illustrate the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ painfully ham-fisted examples of rationalist construction involving blunt conjunctions of load-bearing iron and masonry assembled with no object other than that of seeming to fulfil measurable functional and technological requirements . There has been general agreement that , though interesting as intellectual exercises , these are thoroughly unattractive in every other way , thus disproving Viollet 's belief that a well-reasoned and practically useful design must always be an aesthetically suc-cessful design . Moreover , the designs are structurally miscon-ceived and are an early example of mock-engineering . Viollet-le-Duc seems in certain passages to be one of those writers who see only two possible alternatives for architecture : either as capricious fashion , arbitrary and trivial , or as the expression of some external centre of gravity such as social and political ideals , technological necessity , or the spirit of the age . To those who adhere to this outlook , the existence of an artistic tradition with its own canons of judgement and its own standards does not occur . Viollet 's ideas about architecture derive in general as well as in three important particulars , from eighteenth-century neo-Classicism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the truth and morality of Greek architecture and society which derives from Winckelmann and which was also devel-oped by Marx who saw the essential quality and appeal of Greek culture as a reflection of the childhood of the human race ; f secondly , a related primitivist ' notion that Roman and // Renaissance architecture lost contact with the pure fount of Greek truth , and is thus morally and stylistically in questionable taste ; and , thirdly , a belief , deriving from the rationalist theorists of eighteenth-century France , that beneath the appearance of Gothic architecture there must lie some constructional system capable of universal application so that if only it could be isolated and defined it could serve as the key to all our present problems . For him Greeks and Goths link hands across a sea of troubles : the Greek arts are free and independent , the Roman arts are enthralled ; and if the barriers placed between the two camps , ancient and modern , were thrown down , there is every reason to believe that the Greek artists would have a much more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Romans , who have been ranked as their allies , while in reality they are only their oppressors. ' 23 Trying to define the nature of this enthralment , he writes : one of the characteristics of Architectural Art at the close of the seventeenth and during the eighteenth century is the absence of style ' , 24 and again : the style of Architecture during the declining years of the Roman Empire and that of the eighteenth century consist sic in the absence of style ' .25 The reason for this is that they all show an evident contempt for the form really appropriate to the object and its uses ' . Thus , if a Roman matron of the period of the Republic were to appear in a drawing-room filled with ladies dressed in hooped skirts with powdered hair and a superstructure of plumes or flowers , the Roman lady would present a singular figure ; but it is none the less certain that her dress would have style , while those of the ladies in hooped skirts would be in ( the style of the period ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ architecture is a sin against taste , for taste consists essentially in making the appearance accord with the reality ' .27 Compared with modern Classical architecture even ancient Roman begins to look truthful : A Roman-Corinthian monolithic isolated column of marble or granite has style , because the eye , ascending this huge block of stone from base to summit without perceiving a single joint , comprehends its rigid function , which is perfectly indicated by the material and its homogeneity . But a Corinthian column composed of courses of stone , like those of the Madeleine , or the Pantheon in Paris , has not style , because // the eye is disquieted at seeing such slender points of support formed of small stones piled one on the other.28 So the eighteenth-century column , like the hooped dress , is a sin against taste ' because its outward appearance does not correspond with what its constructional reality is in the case of the dress , or ought to be in that of the column . The implication seems to be that technological function and materials left to their own devices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man interferes in the process , with his imagination and caprice , the better . Gothic art is continually held up as a shining example of this laissez-faire materialism : Viollet writes of thirteenth-century architecture , in this general movement individualities soon disappeared , and architecture assumed the form of a science ' .29 In this anonymous process of assembly no one will have to exercise the power of choice since everything can safely be left to the dictates of the programme ' : There are in architecture ? if I may thus express myself ? two indispensable modes in which truth must be adhered to . We must be true in respect of the programme , and true in respect of the constructive processes . ' 3o As we have already argued in the case of Pugin , this kind of language either means nothing at all , or is demonstrably wrong as when , for example , it leads Viollet to condemn columns made up of drums rather than monoliths . The dreary consequences of the vain attempt to eliminate the human contribution to the art of architecture ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and tradition that this implies ? are clearly spelt out towards the beginning of the final chapter of the first volume : In the study of the arts of the past , therefore , we should observe a clear distinction between a form which is only the reflection of a tradition , a form adopted without consideration , ? and a form which is the immediate expression of a requirement , of a certain social condition ; and it is only the study of the latter that issues in practical advantage , ? an advantage not consisting in the imitation of this form , but in the example it affords of the application of a principle.31 In his worldly or what might today be called his consumeroriented ' materialism , it did not occur to him either that the reflection of a tradition ' might itself be the immediate // expression of a requirement ' which was more binding than a mechanical requirement , or that forms of which the motivation is primarily aesthetic can appear to be the consequence of technological necessity . Thus a persistent tradition in modern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ building of 1914 to Stirling 's glazed History Faculty building at Cambridge of 1964 , has been the belief that glass has some special and unchallengeable role as the expression of the spirit of modernity . In fact its use is generally an aesthetic urge disguised as a technological necessity and in the History Faculty , for example , certainly can not be justified by convenience , construction , or propriety ' . Thus without some antecedent aesthetic idea , no amount of faith that the programme ' or the materials will somehow suggest their own solution will be capable of producing architecture . As we mentioned earlier , Viollet-le-Duc has in fact a very clear picture of the only type of society which can produce good architecture , although there is a sense in which he pretends that he has not . He could not reconcile his picture of Gothic architecture as a truthful rational structure evolving inevitably from simple faith in programme and materials , with his knowledge that its builders had believed in God and authority and lived in a feudal society that was inegalitarian and therefore , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was just a natural way of building , the first thing Viollet had to do was to remove from it any suspicion of association with priests and particularly with monks , since if it is unnatural to be a priest it is still more so to be a monk . He did this by drawing a contrast between Romanesque and Gothic . Romanesque already stood condemned because it looked back to Roman art , the art of thraldom and oppression ; it could now be further condemned as an art produced by monks : We have an art that sprang from Roman traditions and Byzantine influences , ? Romanesque art cultivated in the cloisters ; in a few years we quit this for a new phase of art , practised exclusively by laymen ? an art based on geometry and the observation of laws hitherto unknown ? the equilibrium of forces ; and this art continually advances ; it soon transcends its original aim . The lower classes combine and obtain privileges by force or address ; we become merchants , agriculturalists , and manufacturers.32 Viollet-le-l ) uc 29 The tendency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own reflection could hardly he more clearly demonstrated than in Viollet 's picture of a Gothic world closely resembling the developments of nineteenth-century European society . In his false antithesis between Romanesque and Gothic , he conveniently forgets on the one hand the great strength of the Romanesque tradition in secular architecture and , on the other , that Suger , patron of the first Gothic building , was a Benedictine monk . The note of fantasy , or at least of wishful thinking , which colours his interpretation of the relationship between Gothic design and Gothic society , is persistently maintained and developed . He writes of the origins of Gothic : The Encyclopaedic spirit , and the application of the exact sciences engaged the attention of enlightened men ; and the influence of the monks then disappeared for ever from the history of art . Architecture fell into the hands of laymen . . . The desire for political consolidation and union , the tendency to investigation , to the acquisition of knowledge , and to the immediate practical application of what had been acquired , and the reaction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men reasoned on every question that presented itself ; they examined everything ; they had a firm belief in the progress of science , and exhibited a daring boldness without pausing a single day in their rapid career . In this general movement individualities soon dis-appeared , and architecture assumed the form of a science.33 The interpretation of Gothic as lay , bourgeois , secular , almost Protestant , is probably inspired by the writings of the scholar-statesman , F.-P. -G . Guizot ( 1787-1874 ) . t To Viollet 's fertile mind the curious notion now suggested itself that this great body of laymen must have felt the need to agitate for political rights ' like nineteenth-century workers , and that the cathedrals were somehow an attempt to sublimate those desires : We must not forget that architecture was then cultivated only by laymen belonging to the common people , having under them guilds of craftsmen . It would seem that the middle class of society . . . felt the necessity of association . . . which should render it , so to speak , independent of the past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This class of artists and craftsmen , not being able to claim political rights , and not hoping to rival the power of the feudal noblesse , strove for enfranchisement by work ; they made architecture a kind of freemasonry , to which initiation // was requisite ? an initiation that was constantly made more difficult : this middle class felt that they possessed no material vantage-ground , ? that study and the practice of the arts could alone secure them a moral independence . . . For the rise of that architecture was but the awakening of the ancient Gallic spirit : a spirit which . . . forced a way to light and liberty through every available issue . Gothic architecture , at its commencement , was a protest against monastic influence . . . its stones speak ; they do not express suffering ' , as we were recently told by the Academie des Beaux Arts , but , on the contrary , enfranchised labour , ? the triumph of an intellect which feels its power , which acts , which is asserting its independence , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and which is conscious that it will one day become in its turn the ruling power.34 Elsewhere we are told that in the thirteenth century the art invented by the secular school was essentially democratic ' , 3s and that today we can recapture that spirit in spite of three centuries of oppression ' ; thus in our own times , as in all former periods , it is from below that the movement proceeds .. the old spirit of the lay craftsmen of the twelth century is being gradually awakened , for in France the humblest workman reasons and desires to understand what he is doing ; and he conceives a passion for works in whose general plan as well as in the details he can detect a logical sequence . Our workmen are , in fact , of the same stuff as our soldiers ... ' 36 It need hardly be pointed out that it is all a fantasy world of Viollet-le-Duc 's own creation , and that a different and more realistic picture of the Gothic world has emerged from the patient researches of scholars ranging from Emile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Finally , we may observe in Viollet 's writings how his belief in democracy and in the Zeitgeist led him to argue that phases in architectural development are produced collectively and from the bottom upwards . The unlikely thesis that it is from below that the movement proceeds ' was developed in a book published near the end of his life , L ' Art russe , ses origines , ses elements constituifs , son apogee , son avenir ( 1877 ) , where he wrote : It is never from above that those invigorating principles emerge without which art degenerates into imitation ; it is from below , it is through the popular consciousness or instinct . Every renewal is the consequence of something worked out in the spirit of the people , of the masses : if is never the product of an elite.37 // It is characteristic of the populist democrat that he locates the Zeitgeist in the Volk or le peuple : sociologism and Hegelian historicism are combined here , as they are in Marxism . Yet it would be wrong to suggest that we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Viollet-le-Duc , or indeed that we have painted a portrait of him at all . We are concerned only to show the ways in which a particular theme has affected the approaches of different writers and scholars at different times . ... the revolution will be brought about by the proletariat , and will not be imposed on it from above by an enlightened section of the middle classes . The progressive section of the middle classes can most usefully collaborate by arousing the proletariat to political consciousness and organising it for the struggle . In the same way the culture of the revolution will be evolved by the proletariat and not imposed on it from above by the enlightened middle classes .

PART II The Theme in the Twentieth Century 1 . LETHABY The doctrine of Viollet-le-Duc lies behind the writings of the influential critic , architect , and educator William Richard Lethaby ( 1857-1931 ) . A pleasingly eccentric product of the English Arts and Crafts movement overlaid with French rationalism , his views have been taken very seriously by successive propagandists of modern architecture beginning with Pevsner in Industrial Art ( 1937 ) . For J. M. ( now Sir James ) Richards he was in 1940 the wisest of all English architectural writers ' , ' and Macleod , who described him in 1971 as my central figure ' , proclaimed that I now feel for him something akin to his own " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Webb ' .2 L , ethaby 's best-known book is probably Architecture , an Introduction to the History and Theory of the Art of Building , first published in 1911 in the Home University Library of Modern Knowledge ' and reaching a wider audience in subsequent editions between the wars . From the point of view of the theme we are trying to trace in the present book , Lethaby 's most telling arguments are that Gothic was just a natural way of building which evolved inevitably out of the technology of construction and materials , and that the Renaissance was reprehensible because it involved knowledge , taste , and connoisseurship . The picture he gives of Gothic is as follows : ... a Gothic cathedral may be compared to a great cargo-ship which has to attain to a balance between speed and safety . The church and the ship were both designed in the same way by a slow perfecting of parts // ... Nothing great or true in building seems to have been invented in the sense of wilfully designed .. . A noble building , indeed any work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of design by some individual genius , it is the outcome of ages of experiment . . . . Thus it was that a cathedral was not designed , but dis-covered , or revealed ' . Indeed building has been found out ? like speech , writing , the use of metals ? hence a noble architecture is not a thing of will , of design , of scholarship . A true architecture is the discovery of the nature of things in building ... 3 It would be hard to devise a more misleading intepretation of Gothic . Inherently improbable in the face of the sparkling grace and imagination everywhere present in Gothic art , which can only have been the product of individual personal-ities with will and taste , it is an interpretation which has been entirely demolished by modern scholarship . Thus George Hen-derson writes : we can not suppose that the mediaeval artist was any less capable , exacting , or professional , than his more self-conscious successors in later centuries ' , t4 and John Harvey in publishing a series of medieval Texts on Style and Fashion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the period simply accepted style and changing fashions heed-lessly . Many texts prove the contrary : changes were keenly observed , and in particular the great change from Romanesque to Gothic ' .5 Typical of the texts he cites is that referring to the rebuilding of Auxerre Cathedral in 1215 by the Bishop of Auxerre : The Bishop saw that his cathedral at Auxerre was an old building and very small , suffering from decay and age , while others in every direction round about were raising their heads in a wonderfully beautiful style ( mira specie venustatis ) . . . He had it pulled to the ground . . . that , putting off the decrepitude of antiquity , it might grow young in a more elegant style of novelty . ' Such passages as these are particularly valuable for demol-ishing Lethaby 's Romantic populist interpretation of Gothic development as a slow evolution scarcely noticeable whilst in progress and not likely to be much affected by the whim or taste of individuals . In fact what is striking about Gothic is // the suddenness of its arrival at Saint-Denis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imitated and developed in the Great Ile de France cathedrals . Having established to his satisfaction that Gothic architecture was not the product of will , design and scholarship ' , it was inevitable that he should attack Renaissance architecture which so clearly was . It is dismissed in the surprisingly short space of barely eight pages , which makes the four chapters devoted to Egyptian and Babylonian architecture seem somewhat excessive by contrast . He reluctantly admits that because of the survival of Roman buildings in Italy , The Renaissance in Roman Italy was . . . a perfectly natural impulse , and was , indeed , inevitable ' , but believes that it can not be justified outside Italy . Perhaps ' , he muses , if it had taken some different turning it might have been more obviously beneficial .. . In looking back , art loses its life ' . ' He is very anxious to show that the Renaissance does not , and can not , have life : the Roman revival as a whole has proved arid and sterile , nothing grows from it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by those who have in part understood the great primary styles , Greek or Gothic , that the Renaissance is a style of boredom . However beautiful single works may be , it tends to be blind , puffy , and big-wiggy . . . Its highest inspiration was good taste , it was architect 's architecture . Splendid works were wrought even in the age of its gloomy maturity by Peruzzi , Michael Angelo , and Wren , but as a whole it seems to be the art of an age of Indigestion .. . the Renaissance as a whole lacked the spirit of life . Gothic art witnesses to a nation in training , hunters , craftsmen , athletes ; the Renaissance is the art of scholars , courtiers , and the connoisseurship of middlemen.8 The attack on architect 's architecture ' springs from the belief we have been investigating that architectural works are always determined by extra-architectural criteria . The juxtaposition of scholars and athletes is simply the reflection of Lethaby 's Romantic , anti-intellectual populism . The fantasy and real hatred which run through his account hardly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take Renaissance architecture seriously and the consequent lapse into a homespun critical language , e.g. puffy , and big-wiggy ' , in contrast with what is allegedly expressive of the reality ' of the people . The Renaissance is condemned by a false contrast with the Middle Ages in which , remarkably , there were 3.6 The Theme in the Twentieth Century supposed to be no architects , scholars , or courtiers : whereas as Henderson writes : The age of the Renaissance was to inherit from the Middle Ages the ideal of the omnicompetent artist , able to plan and devise all aspects of some great enterprise , ready to turn his hand to half-a-dozen tasks .. . Then again Leonardo helps us to realise that no very violent revolution has taken place in the economics of art and the status of the artist as we move from the Middle Ages into the age of the Renaissance.9 Lethaby 's collectivist and anti-intellectual view of European architecture ? an idiosyncratic blend of the Arts and Crafts movement and Viollet-le-Duc ? could be regarded as part of a search for an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the arena of style and fashion ' . With this chimera in mind , Lethaby was ready to define what modern architecture must be . In 1920 he wrote : We require an active art of building which will take its " style " for granted , as does naval architecture ' ; 10 and in Architecture he argued : All modern buildings have too much that is merely capricious . Little in ancient architecture was " designed " . Things designed by a single mind are mostly " sports " , which must quickly perish . Only that which is in the line of development can persist . ' " The final message of the book is that in the consensus on which this architecture of collective endeavour will be established , the only agreement that seems possible is agreement on a scientific basis , on an endeavour after perfect structural efficiency ' . ' Z The trouble is , of course , that structural efficiency is only a means and not an end . In itself it is not particularly interesting except to the specialist or the structural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organs are generally of interest only to the physiologist and the doctor . Most people take structural efficiency for granted , and surely should be allowed to do so . It will only obtrude itself if it goes wrong , just as we only become preoccupied with the functioning of our bodily organs when they go wrong . Without wishing to build too much on this biological analogy , one could argue that with man and architecture structural effiency is of value and interest only as a means to an end . The passages we have been quoting represent an interesting combination of Romantic collectivism ( i.e. Volksgeist ) and // functional necessity . The Romantic populistic view , developed in the early nineteenth century , was that the anonymous people , labouring silently in confrontation with the hard tasks of life , produce works which no one has deliberately designed but which are products of the unconscious wisdom , the adaptive resourcefulness , of the folk-soul ' . This idea seems to pervade several of the interpretations of architecture we are investigating in the present book : for example , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ technological necessity . It also relates to the all-pervasive collectivist belief that the architect has no will or imagination of his own but is simply the expression ' of something lying in the collective unconscious ' . He must ever respond to collective needs and must act as the collectivity demands . 2 . BRAVE NEW WORLD Lethaby anticipated in many ways the Brave New World mentality of the creators of the Modern Movement and their supporters between the wars . Mies van der Rohe , for example , represents this mentality perfectly , though he overlays it with the tradition of Kunstwollen characteristic of recent German art history . In 1923 he wrote : We reject all esthetic speculation , all doctrine , all formalism . Architecture is the will of an epoch translated into space ; living , changing , new ' ; and in 1925 : We refuse to recognise problems of form but only problems of building ' .13 In a paper of 1924 called , significantly , Baukunst and Zeitwille ' , Mies van der Rohe developed further this blend of Lethaby and the Zeitgeist into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ future : Greek temples , Roman basilicas and mediaeval cathedrals are significant to us as creations of a whole epoch rather than as works of individual architects . Who asks for the name of these builders ? Of what significance are the fortuitious personalities of their creators ? Such buildings are impersonal by their very nature . They are pure expressions of their time . Their true meaning is that they are symbols of their epoch . . . The whole trend of our time is towards the secular . The endeavours of the mystic will be remembered as mere episodes . . . We are concerned today with questions of a general nature . The // individual is losing significance ; his destiny is no longer what interests us . The decisive achievements in all fields are impersonal and their authors are for the most part unknown . They are part of the trend of our time towards anonymity.14 The preaching of a chosen type of architecture as an inescapable natural and moral commitment was given firm emphasis at this time in Le Corbusier 's Vers une architecture ( 1923 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a number of articles in slogan form which had first appeared in the journal L'Esprit nouveau in 1919-22 . The consequent muddle and lack of unified argument enabled readers to decide for themselves what its principal message was . They had no doubt that it was Functionalism , though in certain romantic passages Corbusier , in a very unMiesian way , had indicated its inadequacies . The book begins with his celebrated concept of the house as a machine for living in ' , 15 a parallel to Lethaby 's more homespun view that we must aim at getting the small house as perfect as the bicycle ' .16 Le Corbusier 's argument that the House Machine . . . is healthy ( and morally so too ) i17 combines succinctly the pathetic fallacies we are investigating : that particular types of architectural form are morally regenerative and physically health-giving . The transference of the principles of human morality to inanimate objects had led Pugin and Ruskin to attack the illusionism of Renaissance and Baroque architecture on the grounds that because man should not tell a lie buildings should not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his opening chapter when he claims that architecture is a question of morality ; lack of truth is intolerable , we perish in untruth ' , " and we find later on that this inevitably leads him to attack the Renaissance . Like Ruskin he finds the Romanesque , by contrast , morally acceptable and he writes of the twelfthcentury Santa Maria in Cosmedin in Rome : To think that this church was in existence in Rome when the great Renaissance was in full swing with its gilded palaces and its horrors ! ' 19 And there is even a page of photographs , called The Rome of Horrors ' , which includes details from the Palazzo Barberini , the Galleria Colonna and the Castel Sant ' Angelo . The old Puritan idea that simplicity is moral and elaboration immoral // leads him to one of the most extreme examples of his particular version of the pathetic fallacy : the caption of a photograph of one of the Parthenon triglyphs , Austere profiles . Doric morality.i20 His obsession with the notion that primary forms are beautiful forms because they can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only on Renaissance but on Gothic architecture : Gothic architecture is not , fundamentally , based on spheres , cones and cylinders . Only the nave is an expression of a simple form , but of a complex geometry of the second order ( intersecting arches ) . It is for that reason that a cathedral is not very beautiful and that we search in it for compensations of a subjective kind outside plastic art.22 Along with the worship of simple forms goes a worship of machinery . This is carried to its extreme in the section of the book called the Manual of the Dwelling ' where Le Corbusier claims that it is preferable to listen to mechanically reproduced music ( even the pianola ! ) than to live music because in the latter case one has the embarrassment of actually seeing live musicians : The gramophone or the pianola or wireless will give you exact interpretations of first-rate music , and you avoid catching cold in the concert hall , and the frenzy of the virtuoso . ' 23 Elsewhere in the Manual ' we learn that there must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each occupant must have a dressing-room . Never ' , Le Corbusier admonishes us like a Victorian nanny , undress in your bedroom . It is not a clean thing to do . ' 24 In fact , in his celebrated Villa Savoye , Le Corbusier merged a principal bedroom into a bathroom without any real dividing wall between them . Hygiene movements had been popular in France since the turn of the century but really originated in Germany as part of the process of national rehabilitation , the renewal of the German people ' , after the defeat of Prussia in 1807 . The hygiene mania of Le Corbusier was part of the general argument for purity , and seems somehow to reflect a hatred of tradition as essentially unnatural ' . The Modern Movement combined this rationalist belief in elementary uncluttered schema with the collectivist approach based on belief in the needs of the age and in the nascent real ' spirit of the age . // The idea , then , runs through Le Corbusier 's book that what is simple , supposedly functional , and materialistic in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form , enjoys advantages in terms of health and morality over other different or more complex solutions . Thus it must be imposed on society as soon as possible if we are to avoid revolution , and to bring this point home the last chapter is indeed called Architecture ou Revolution ' . In fact Le Corbusier is himself revolutionary ' , inasmuch as he has an unquestioning faith in the advantages of what is called public ownership ' . The whole book is thus an amalgam of Pugin , Viollet-le-Duc , Choisy , Lethaby , and the rest , bound together with a certain apocalyptic fervour . It was translated into English by the architect Frederick Etchells in 1927 and has been republished frequently ever since . In an edition of 1946 the publisher wrote , This book has probably had as great an influence on English architectural thought as any one publication of the last fifty years . ' A sobering thought . Le Corbusier 's functionalist argument and its apocalyptic overtones were taken up and exaggerated a year or so later by the German architect Bruno Taut in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is founded on sound efficiency , this efficiency itself , or rather its utility , will form its own aesthetic law . A building must be beautiful when seen from outside if it reflects all these qualities .. . The architect who achieves this task becomes a creator of an ethical and social character ; the people who use the building for any purpose , will , through the structure of the house , be brought to a better behaviour in their mutual dealings and relationship with each other . Thus architecture becomes the creator of new social observances.25 Here we have a clearly stated Puginian view of architecture as essentially a socially manipulative force . What is less clear is the nature of this proposed new society which the forms of modern architecture are going to engender . All we know is that it will , of course , be quite different from any previous society . That Le Corbusier had also fallen victim to the fallacy that the human mind can ever become a tabula rasa is evident from his claim that he had designed the Villa Savoye pour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absence in authors such as Taut of any serious thought on the Brave New Worll 41 nature of the proposed new society makes the claim , that modern architects have some special socially constructive role to play and message to offer , a particularly empty one . While Taut is absolutely specific about what the new architecture is going to look like , he defines its social role ? which he regards as a matter of equal urgency ? in loose and vacuous language : Here is the beginning of a new life which will take the place of ideals which are fast dying out . And this life already has the tradition of a century behind it . . . This tradition is that of the power of production , which , according to Bernard Shaw , must always be revolutionary . According to him , every healthy thinking person must be filled with revolutionary impulses ; but they can only become real revolutionaries in later life after recognising the difficulties involved . This has not been very differently expressed by Lenin , in the words that all serve the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .27 Where Le Corbusier had seen architecture as a parallel to or substitute for the social revolution , Taut is more explicit about their identical roles ( though anything but explicit when it comes to details ) . Towards the end of the book we are shown the divine light of modern architecture illuminating the way from a Ruskinian Apocalypse to the Communist Utopia : It has been asserted that literature and music also , to a certain extent , are now just emerging from the state of adolescence into that of manhood ; that in lieu of sentimental claims , facts are now considered as authoritative and style-forming . . . The same might just as well be claimed for architecture . . . The age of manhood brings with it a state of mind in which there is not so much inclination to be led away by a beautiful idea , but rather to be concerned with real facts . . . One might almost see a connection between the synchronous erection of the Crystal Palace and the Communistic manifestos of Marx and Engels .. . This darkness of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just at this point that the fecundity of modern architecture will have to pass its strongest test.28 In Taut , then , we see a shift from the belief in architecture as the tail wagged by the ideological dog , to architecture as a central agent in the renewal of society . The architect takes on the task of interpreting the needs ' of society and by his constructions guides those needs to gratification in an appropriate form of society , namely healthy ' socialism . // Five years later this new doctrine of modernity was preached by Herbert Read in Art and Industry ( 1934 ) . It is inspired by the self-delusion we found in Le Corbusier that there is a new thing called modern man , a new animal without roots in the past and whose mind is , or must become , a tabula rasa . Speaking on his first page of the radically new art that will be appropriate for this new man , Read argues that not until we have stripped it of all the irrelevancies imposed on it by a particular culture or civilisation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Man without a memory will produce art with no aim other than the immediately measurable and practical : art which meets real needs ' . In tribute to the mechanistic theories of Viollet-le-Duc and Lethaby , Read believed that Greek and Gothic man had already achieved an architecture inspired solely by the need to fulfil man 's animal needs : In the twelfth and thirteenth centuries , as in the fifth century B.C. , there existed , in Northern Europe and in Greece respectively , phases of architectural development , and of industrial design generally , that have never been excelled in history . There is one significant fact about such periods : they are without an aesthetic . What they did , they did as the solution of practical problems , without taste , without academic tradition.29 It is evident in such a passage that Read 's passionate commitment to the promotion of modern design has blinded him to the obvious shallowness of his arguments . The notion of cathedrals being assembled by bands of anonymous mechanics without taste or traditions is a surprising one for any twentieth-century art @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shown , the researches of modern scholars should by now have suppressed any lingering affection for it . Along with the technological intepretation of medieval art goes the inevitable attack on the Renaissance . He describes how as a consequence of the sinister growth of educated patrons with cultural expectations that were fed by the type of learning which the Classical Revival encouraged , there sprang up a tradition of connoisseurship or dilettantism , based on the knowledge and appreciation of such works of art . This tradition is known to us as Taste , or Good Taste , and to it , I think , we owe all the confusion of values that has // existed since the sixteenth century until the present day . ' 3o Like the Italian Futurists , Read is able to write off the cultural achievement of the past four centuries confident that modern technology is the Messiah for which the world has been waiting since the age of the cathedrals . Comparing a five-hundred-foot-high mast at the B.B.C. West Regional ' Transmitting Station with Gothic architecture , he claims that Gothic verticality may have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a problem preceding the consciousness of a resulting aesthetic experience ' .31 The belief in the absolute value of adhering to the requirements of technology derives in part from a belief in the spirit of the age and that the spirit has come to reside in the machine . Popper has shown how such a preoccupation leads to a belief in the urgency of novelty and change . In Read 's case all this is overlaid with a vague Marxism , a materialist determinism . Thus he writes towards the end of the book : The economic law is absolute , and healthy ; it compels the human spirit to adapt itself to new conditions , and to be ever creating new forms . It is only when sentimentality and a nostalgia for the past are allowed to prevail , that these forms cease to evolve in conformity with aesthetic values . ' 32 In Read 's Anarchy and Order ( 1954 ) we learn a little more about the new society and the new art : as the expression of unchallengeable truths , neither of these will any longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a permanent reality ' . Read describes how the first step on the road to truth was achieved when painting revolted , like poetry , against the artificiality and irrelevance of the academic tradition of the eighteenth century ' . These heroic pioneers were men whose aims and whose achievements have step by step built up a new conception of reality ? a conception of reality totally opposed to the bourgeois standards of the period . Constable began a movement which includes Courbet , Daumier , Van Gogh , Cezanne , and Seurat ' . Read summarizes the significance of this tradition in the following way : The main tradition , the only tradition which is revolutionary in essence , in its fundamental vision of life , that is the tradition which must be integrated with the social revolution . ' 33 // Any attempt to unravel this tangled skein of false sociology and false art history confronts us eventually with Read 's ambition of establishing in social organization as well as in artistic form an enduring and unassailably ideal reality ' . According to this view , just as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' and classless ' rather than artificial ' and bourgeois ' , so will the social revolution establish a new order that is natural and truthful because it has been stripped of all the false restrictions and distinctions artificially imposed on it . This cant culminates in a picture of the ideal future : The inevitable is the classless society ? the society without a bureaucracy , without an army , without any closed grade or profession , without any functionless components . ' A hierarchy of talent , a division of labour , there must be ; but only within the functional group , the collective organization . Whether responsibility and efficiency should be rewarded is a nice problem for the future ; what is certain is that it should not be rewarded by any kind of money or tokens of exchange which could give one man power to command the services of another outside the collective organizations ... . In the classless society , the mind of every individual will have at least the opportunity to expand in breadth and depth , and culture will once more be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ancient Greece , in China , in Medieval Europe , and indeed in all the great epochs of civilization.34 In common with several of the writers we are investigating , Read puts an emphasis on naturalness ' and seems to interpret its meaning as meeting real needs ' . These needs ' frequently spring from technological developments which , it is believed , should determine what men ought to be or do . For Read , economic circumstances are normative so that man 's actions must be guided by them and not guide them . Read offered what the collectivists of the 1930s wanted to hear , whether they were Fabian Socialists , National Socialists or , like Read himself , Anarchist Socialists . He was undoubtedly a figure of powerful influence at this time . Along with Lenin , he is cited as an authority by Anthony ( now Sir Anthony ) Blunt in an essay entitled Art under Capitalism and Socialism . ' This appeared in a collection of essays by Marxists and fellow-travellers edited by Cecil Day Lewis under the title The Mind // in Chains : Socialism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present state of capitalism ' , writes Blunt , the position of the artist is hopeless ' , 35 but he looks forward to the real ' art which will emerge from the proletarian revolution . He explains that : In the nineteenth century when the bourgeoisie , being still on the up-grade , was attempting to impose its culture on the working classes , it was impossible for artists representing these classes to attack and dis-credit the culture that was being offered to them . But at the present time , when the workers are in a more hopeful position , with a workers ' state actually formed and a workers ' culture built up in the U.S.S.R. , this is no longer the most important function for the revolutionary artist . Blunt describes for us what the real art of the socialist state ' will be like . It will be alive and effective , and what it will have lost in comparison with bourgeois art will be a certain refinement , which is not at all necessarily a sign of living and progressive art . The new art @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old . ' 36 It was Herbert Read who suggested to Leslie Martin the idea of writing a handbook for the general public explaining the virtues of modern domestic furniture and fittings . This appeared in 1939 as The Flat Book , an aptly-titled textbook illustrative of the 1930s taste for the minimal , the stackable , the washable , for what the authors called the contemporary demand for convenience and efficiency ' . - Design is seen as a kind of democratic anodyne beyond the reach of time and fashion , so that in the Foreword the authors express the hope that the book will at least be a method of ridding ourselves of the more transient forms of " fashion value " by means of which so much furnishing is sold today ' . In 1937 Leslie Martin had been a joint editor with Ben Nicholson and Naum Gabo of a book with the curious title , Circle International Survey of Constructive Art . In their editorial preface the editors referred to the new cultural // unity ' which they hoped to establish . They made it clear , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in England published in the same year , that social manipulation would play an essential role in the achievement of this unity ' . Hence their regret that popular taste , caste prejudice , and the dependence upon private enterprise , completely handicap the development of new ideas in art ' .37 In the opening article Gabo attempts to explain what is meant by constructive ' art . He believes that the war was only a natural consequence of a disintegration which started long ago in the depths of the previous civilization ' , and that the new art will be constructive in the sense of reversing that general process of disintegration . Modern science is another great force which will have its role to play in this process of regeneration . According to Gabo , the task of the scientists of our century . . . consists in the construction of a new stable model for our apprehension of the universe . ' Thus the new constructive art will also be scientific in some sense : indeed at those moments in the history of culture when the creative human genius @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this genius manifested itself in Art and in Science were analagous ' . For example , Raphael would never have dared to take the naturalistic image of his famous Florentine pastrycook as a model for the " Holy Marie " if he had not belonged to the generation which was already prepared to abandon the geo-centrical theory of the universe.i38 The generalizations about the analogies between modern science and constructive art are not pursued and instead we are offered several pages of the empty declamation associated with modern manifestos : In the light of the Constructive idea the purely philosphical wondering about real and unreal is idle . Even more idle is the intention to divide the real into super-real and sub-real , into conscious reality and sub-conscious reality . The Constructive idea knows only one reality . Nothing is unreal in Art.i39 Other designers and theorists take up the theme in a series of short illustrated essays . From Mondrian we learn that the new constructive art will he intolerant of any competition from the past : Certainly the art of the past is superfluous to the new spirit and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it holds people back from the new conception ' ! 40 // Nicholson informs us confidently that " painting " and " religious experience " are the same thing . It is a question of the perpetual motion of a right idea.i41 For Gabo , constructive sculpture is . . . ready to lead us into the future ' ; 42 while Le Corbusier believes that the pure regenerating spirit of modern times will be expressed by organisms with a mathematical interior ' . These organisms will also echo the architecture of primitive times when there was no decoration in the houses ; people lived with a robust simplicity ? proof of their moral wholesomeness ' .43 J. D. Bernal looks forward to the establishment of painting and sculpture which is a powerful part of the social movements of the time ' , and laments that at the present time paintings and sculptures are purchasable objects , not parts of well-conceived social construction ' .44 The concluding essay , by Lewis Mumford , is called The Death of the Monument ' . It is a hymn of praise dedicated to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humanist : For the most radical change in our modem cosmos has come about through our changed conception of death and immortality : for us , death is an episode in life 's renewal , the terminus of a radical maladaptation : continuity for us exists , not in the individual soul , but in the germ plasm and in the social heritage , through which we are united to all mankind and all nature : renewal comes in the sacrifice of the parent to the child , in the having lived to the living and the yet-to-live . Instead of being oriented toward death and fixity , we are oriented toward life and change.45 To remind ourselves , if such a reminder be necessary , of the fundamentally pernicious nature of such writing we could do no better than to quote the following passage from Sir Herbert Butterfield : Hitler in Mein Kampf pointed out that nature is ruthless since she is prodigal with individual lives and considerate only for the development of the species ; and because he had taken nature as his pattern or first principle , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or his inferences to man-in-history ) , he regarded this inhuman principle as one which was applicable to the human race . . . Too easily we may think of man as merely the last of the animals and in this way arrive at verdicts which we are tempted to transpose into the world of human relations . And some people are so accustomed to thinking of great collectivities and handling them in a mathematical manner , that the whole human story is to them only an // additional chapter in the great book of biology . On such systems as these the individual matters little ? he is the foam on the wave ? and the only thing to consider is the development of the species as a whole . Upon our willingness to engage ourselves rather with man-in-history depends the valuation that we place upon personality , or personalities , as such . Mumford chose to reprint The Death of the Monument ' as part of the final chapter of his book , The Culture of Cities published in 1938 , the year after Circle . Elsewhere in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he meant by a society which is not centered on belief in the importance of the individual soul , but in the germ plasm and in the social heritage ' ; and of what he thinks will be the role of modern architecture in the creation of such a society : Taken together , modern form , modem architecture , modern commun-ities are prophetic emergents of a biotechnicf society : a society whose productive system and consumptive demands will be directed towards the maximum possible nurture , under ever more adequate material conditions , of the human group , and the maximum possible culture of the human personality . What has so far been accomplished is but a taste of the more thorough-going order that is to come . So far , architecture and community planning have aided experimentally in the the clarifi-cation of this order : but further re-valuations of doctrine and belief , further accretions of positive knowledge , will in turn alter profoundly the new communities we are in process of building . Throughout the world , a consensus is gradually being established among men of good will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ further the social basis of modern form , and to establish even more definitely its underlying principles.47 Mumford 's talk about the manipulation of the human group ' by means of the more thorough-going order that is to come ' so as to form new communities ' which will achieve a consensus ' about the social basis of modern form ' , gives us a clear view of the Utopia towards which Martin , Gabo , and // Nicholson were leading us in Circle with modern design as the essential agent in the process of transformation . One of the principal missionaries in this movement was Richards , who had befriended Pevsner on his arrival in this country and had joined the staff of the Architectural Review in 1935 . The title of his contribution to Circle , The Condition of Architecture and the Principle of Anonymity ' , is immediately indicative of his notion of the social basis of modern form ' . His defence of the forms of modern architecture which he favoured consisted in extending the view of Greek and Gothic as types of anonymous collective endeavour to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ condemned as an example of malady ' and decay ' of which the cause was a socio-psychological one ' : in other words , it lacked that settled anonymity in architectural design ' which should have been established as the echo or reflection of a unity of social and cultural purpose pervading the whole of life ' . The important quality of inevitability ' , which is supposed to come if one can abolish style , can be found in the eighteenth century because the architects , in the sense of the designers , ( usually simply the builders ) were anonymous ? that is to say , their personalities were culturally irrelevant ' .48 This inhuman fantasy is developed as follows : Though the architecture of the eighteenth century was based on an imported mode , and though it was the age of that anti-social being , the talented amateur or connoisseur , it absorbed that mode into a genuine folk art : no longer imported , but the natural ? the only ? means of expression of genuine folk work . . . . this universal tradition of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mediaeval tradition . In mediaeval times the anonymity ? and the universality of the idiom ? was even more characteristic . The impulse ? or purpose whose unity made this tradition possible ? was a religious rather than a civic one : an emotional rather than a rational.49 We need hardly stress the close connection here between anonymity and collectivism as cause and ideal , and the consequent suppression of the achievement of the individual imagination within the framework of an artistic tradition . In his stand for anonymity and populism and against patronage and connoisseurship , Richards reminds us immediately of Lethaby . Richards recognizes that a problem which might // arise from his populistic ideal is that some people might suppose that we already have an anonymous folk architecture of our day : the mass-produced villas and bungalows that constitute the acres of suburbs surrounding all our towns and cities ' .50 And certainly , if one were really seeking a twentiethcentury folk art , one could hardly find a more complete example than in the gnomes and half-timbered garage gables of suburban England . But , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Richards can not allow that these really aspire to the condition of a true anonymous folk architecture . He thus writes of the speculative builder : His products form no part of a socio-cultural whole . ' In other words , the praise of folk art turns out to be a screen behind which he can propose arguments in favour of social engineering which will create a totally integrated and consistent whole . The real reason that mass-produced villas could not constitute a genuine anonymous folk architecture is because they were part of a socio-cultural whole ' determined by the survival of middle-class values and the private speculator . We were , after all , warned in the Editorial that popular taste , caste prejudice , and the dependence upon private enterprise , completely handicap the development of new ideas in art ' . Richards reiterates this point when he emphasizes that the answer , then , to the question how we can regain a true folk architecture remains a sociological , or political one ' .51 The powerful desire for unity , for what Richards called the socio-cultural whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every period contains an all-pervasive , all-dominating theme or idea . This worship of the consistency ' of art , technology , and social organization is part of a denigration of the dignity of artistic modes and part , too , of a tendency to make them mere expressions of something else . The emphasis which we find in Richards on the whole ' or holism with its opposition to individual imagination is , as Popper has pointed out , characteristic of historicism . What , then , is the society and what are the politics for which Circle can be seen as thinly veiled propaganda ? The answer is , of course , the ideal of the progressive intellectuals and fellow-travellers of the 1930s : Soviet Communism . But Richards ' views of the relationship between art and politics Brave New World 51 had not prepared him for the fact that the perfect society established in Russia since 1917 had still not , in his view , produced the perfect architecture by 1937 . He is prepared to accept , however , that there may be a certain time-lag : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the cultural can not be relied upon to readjust itself immediately is shown by the case of Russia . There , the social unity of purpose which has successfully been re-established had not yet crystallized itself into a new cultural one ; art of a bourgeois nature still flourishes , partly in reaction against the extremist , revolutionary movement that tried to set up an abstract ideology with inadequate technical equipment ; but largely because , owing to psychological instability , the superficial advertisement of progress becomes more important than the fact of progress ? sociological development has progressed so much faster than educational.52 Three years later Penguin Books chose to publish Richards ' An Introduction to Modern Architecture which had a wide popular influence both during and after the war . Richards opens his book by lamenting the poor quality of nineteenthcentury architecture . The explanation , he thinks , is easy : Architecture got left behind in the march of Progress , and architects found themselves in a wholly artificial position , living and working in an unreal world . Having . . . lost touch and confidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and what we call their bad taste was simply taste ' exercised far too independently of the real function of architecture . In the previous century , the eighteenth , everything was straightforward.53 Apart from pursuing the chimera of the march of Progress and what it does or does not force unwitting humans to do , Richards sets up a false antithesis between the straightforward ' eighteenth century and the stylistically varied nineteenth century . In fact , stylistic variety was one aspect of the eighteenth-century neo-Classical movement and nothing to do with some supposed loss of touch and confidence ' by Victorian architects , still less with eighteenth-century social structure as Richards seems to suppose : Now in the eighteenth century this quality of consistency was closely bound up with the social structure . The educated class was a small one numerically , but it was still the ruling class and took an active interest in architecture . There was therefore only one source of style , only one mould of fashion . // He goes on very questionably to argue from this position that Victorian architectural style was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uneducated captains of industry . This argument is used to establish a notion of modern architecture which is , by contrast , collective and anonymous . The idea of collective artistic achievement is a simple application of the idea of the Zeitgeist incarnated in the anonymous Volk ? a theme familiar in the work of Herder and other Romantic populists . Richards claims that if anyone dares to criticize modern architects it will be because they forget that they are looking at people as individuals , whereas it is people as Society that architecture has to cater for ' .55 This collectivist and progressive view is emphatically underlined : It has been said before that great architecture is more a product of the times than of personalities . ' S6 There must be no personality because there must be no memory : that is the essence of the doctrine of the tabula rasa which we achieve by avoiding a preconceived idea of what a building is going to look like ( which is the basis of the Victorian view of architecture as large-scale sculpture ) , but , instead , taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leads Richards to accept at face value the cult of simplicity ' of the English Arts and Crafts movement and of Voysey in particular . Voysey 's large but coy pebble-dashed cottages with their artistically placed water-butts and shutters pierced with heartshapes had already been appreciated by Pevsner , though not by Goodhart-Rendel who rightly identified their message as only-little-me-ishness ' .58 Richards followed Pevsner 's line and was therefore able to believe that Voysey was one of the people who made modern architecture possible because he discarded " styles " and allowed the job to be done to be the source of style , instead of a historical precedent or accumulation of precedents selected by the architect ' .59 Norman Shaw 's Bedford Park , a Picturesque suburb or make-believe village for the well-off middle class with artistic leanings , is also hailed by Richards as a great blow struck for ruthless modernity and unashamed truth , a step in time with the march of Progress ' or , as he describes it , another breath of nature let into the artificiality of architectural fancy dress ' .60 In fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the conBrave // temporary situation as Marie Antoinette 's hameau at Versailles , to which it was , in some ways , quite closely related . While Richards , the Architectural Review , and even Summerson , t were preaching commitment to modern design as an essential instrument in the process of Building a Better Britain , an emigre Swiss in America was developing a yet more grandiose vision of modern architecture which appeared in book form in 1941 under the title , Space , Time and Architec-ture : the Growth of a New Tradition . The author , Sigfried Giedion , had been a pupil of WOlfflin at Munich , and in 1938 becarne a professor at Harvard University . Space , Time and Architecture , which he described as the product of ' stimulat-ing association with young Americans ' , 61 was a publication of his Charles Eliot Norton lectures of 1938-9 . From the start the book enjoyed wide popularity on both sides of the Atlantic and , through five editions and sixteen printings , it has grown to nearly one thousand pages and been translated into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the current edition as a milestone in modern thought ' , while Walter Gropius has called it the standard work on the devel-opment of modern architecture ' . The portentous therapeutic role of the book as a bringer of wholeness ' to modern society is stated in the opening words of the Foreword to the first edition : Space , Time and Architecture is intended for those who are alarmed by the present state of our culture and anxious to find a way out of the apparent chaos of its contradictory tendencies . I have attempted to establish , both by argument and by objective evidence , that in spite of the seeming confusion there is nevertheless a true , if hidden , unity , a secret synthesis , in our present civilization . To point out why this synthesis has not become a conscious and active reality has been one of my chief aims.62 The book is thus inspired by a belief that some universally accepted synthesis , some permanent modern consensus , is just around the corner . This belief depends on what Popper called historicism : the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that if we can succeed in unravelling this plot , we shall hold the key to the future . ' 63 The secret synthesis ' will not , of course , have any of the characteristics of style ' since that would mark it out as something essentially transient . Thus Giedion writes : There is a word we should refrain from using to describe contemporary architecture ? ' style ' . The moment we fence architecture within a notion of style ' , we open the door to a formalistic approach . The contemporary movement is not a style ' in the nineteenth-century meaning of form characterization . It is an approach to the life that slumbers unconsciously within all of us . ' Giedion hints at the idea of the collective unconscious in which all creative activity occurs . This was a characteristic of German romantics like Herder , Lazarus , and Steinthal , and is connected with the idea of genius as the conscious expression of the unconscious imagination of the folk-soul . The impact of Giedion 's all-embracing totalitarian argument , with its aim of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pretentious language such as the belief in the life that slumbers unconsciously within all of us ' or that in the work of twentiethcentury architects past , present and future merge together as the indivisible wholeness of human destiny ' .65 Pretentious , too , is the implication of both title and text that the architectural synthesis he is proposing will have a specially unchallengeable position because of its harmony with the Space-Time conception of the universe defined in modern physics . He claims in the Foreword that his book shows the similarity of methods that are in use today in architecture , construction , painting , city planning andscience ' , 66 though what this means in practice is frequent reference to the concept of Space-Time in architecture and one , only one , reference to Einstein . That this concept is of central importance to his message , is a vital part of our slumbering life and of the still unrealized but inevitably emergent indivisible wholeness ' of our destiny , is made clear in the titles of the various parts of the book : for example , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Space-Time in City Planning ' . On analysis , however , it turns out to be simply the nineteenth-century German theories , as refined by Wolfflin , of spatial expression in art : the way volumes are placed in space and relate to one another , the way interior space is // separated from exterior space or is perforated by it to bring about an interpenetration.i67 Doubtless this spatial preoccupa-tion still has a useful role as an art-historical tool , 68 but to hold it up as the solution of the ills of modern life is as in-appropriate as Pugin 's similar claims for Gothic architecture . Giedion 's interpretation of Space-Time becomes less exalted in tone , though no more sober in substance , as the book pro-gresses . It turns out to be a feature of urban motorways , so that the caption to an illustration of the Randall Island clover-leaf intersection and Triborough Bridge in New York City describes the scene depicted as expressive of the space-time conception both in structure and handling of movement ' .69 Space-Time is being in a traffic jam : City-dwellers moving across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . This kind of spatio-temporal awareness was unknown in Baroque times ; it may be a case of the re-development of a primitive sense . ' 70 Giedion 's belief that he is going to reveal the secret synthesis ' of the apparently conflicting tendencies of the modern world derives from the tradition of neo-Hegelian Geistesges-chichte in which he was brought up , and which tends to imply that men are of interest only in so far as they conform to the unarticulated spirit of their age which is struggling towards realization . This goes for the historian as well as those he studies : The historian , the historian of architecture especially , must be in close contact with contemporary conceptions . Only when he is permeated by the spirit of his own time is he prepared to detect those tracts of the past which previous generations have overlooked . . . . Indeed the histor-ian in every field must be united with his own time by as widespread a system of roots as possible . . . . The historian must be intimately a part of his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to it . . . . The historian detached from the life of his own time writes irrelevant history , deals in frozen facts.71 Yet one can surely be suspicious of the implication that the historian owes less to documentary evidence than to inspiration by the spirit of his age . According to this view , as expressed in the writings of Karl Mannheim , t the historian is // not capable of discovering truths by the scholarly exercise of a disciplined mind , but is merely a vehicle of the spirit of the age or of class interests or of the collective unconscious . Basic to this interpretation of history is a belief not merely in the spirit of the age but that the spirit expresses itself through men , rather than that men themselves create and constitute the spirit of the age and are able to help choose what it will be . It is a view which sees art and architecture as an inevitable reflection or expression of something else outside its creators . Giedion was quite clear about it when he wrote : We are looking for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has made toward consciousness of itself . . . Everything in it-i.e. architecture , from its fondness for certain shapes to the approaches to specific building problems which it finds most natural , reflects the conditions of the age from which it springs . It is the product of all sorts of factors ? social , economic , scientific , technical , ethnological . However much a period may try to disguise itself , its real nature will still show through its architecture , whether this uses original forms of expression or attempts to copy bygone epochs . We recognise the character of the age as easily as we identify a friend 's handwriting beneath attempted disguises . It is as an unmistakeable index to what was really going on in a period that architecture is indispensable when we are seeking to evaluate that period . In the great architectural masterpieces , as in every great work of art , the human shortcomings which every period exhibits so liberally fall away . This is why these works are true monuments of their epochs ; with the overlay of recurrent human weaknesses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creation show plainly.72 The basic Hegelian assumptions in such a passage derive immediately from Burckhardt who had , of course , taught Giedion 's own master , Wolfflin . Burckhardt had expressed a belief that : Every cultural epoch which presents itself as a complete and articulate whole expresses itself not only in the life of the state , in religion , art and science , but also imparts its individual character to social life as such.i73 He also , as Gombrich points out , gave this advice to a friend who wanted to write on Netherlandish art : Conceive your task as follows . How does the spirit of the fifteenth century express itself in painting ? Then everything becomes simple.i74 In challenging the validity of such an approach Gombrich remarks , It is one thing to see the interconnectedness of things , another to postulate that all aspects of a culture can be traced back // to one key cause of which they are the manifestation . ' 75 Gombrich goes on to argue that : it is this belief in the existence of an independent supra-individual collective spirit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a true cultural history . ... I hope and believe cultural history will make progress if it also fixes attention firmly on the individual human being . ' 7b Giedion , however , believes in the importance of the central drives of the time ' and , by contrast , in the relative insignifi cance of individuals who may even have been foolish enough to attempt , inevitably unsuccessfully , to resist them . For him each age has what he calls constituent facts't and transitory facts ' . The former are the great absolutes of the age which drive us forwards to endless progress and have binding claims over us which we resist at our peril : Constituent facts are those tendencies which , when they are suppressed , inevitably reappear . Their recurrence makes us aware that these are elements which , all together , are producing a new tradition . ' When Giedion goes on to tell us what some of these ' constitu-ent facts ' are , we come sharply down to earth and discover that they are no more than this own tastes and fancies : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the undulation of the wall , the juxtaposition of nature and the human dwel-ling , the open ground-plan. ' 77 But who can pretend that a preference for an undulating rather than a straight wall repre-sents some permanent and unchallengeable reality ? Or , by the same token , that the man who sometimes wants a room he can be alone in , with a door he can shut , is asking for the impossible by ignoring the constituent fact ' of the open ground-plan ' ? The whole process of reasoning is arbitrary . In disparaging existing traditions and arguing that new ones are necessary , critics such as Giedion base their arguments on allegedly existent but in fact arbitrarily constructed facts ' . Whereas constituent facts are recurrent and cumulative tendencies ' , transitory facts are merely sporadic trends ' . Of these he writes , Facts of the other sort ? equally the work of forces moving in a period ? lack the stuff of permanence and fail to attach themselves to a new tradition . ' Again , they turn out to be cultural developments of which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with every refinement of fashion  --  the furniture of the Second Empire in France is an instance . These we shall call transitory facts . . . The entire output of official painting was a transitory fact of that period i.e. the nineteenth century , almost wholly without significance to the present day.78 Comparing and contrasting the value of constituent and transitory facts , he concludes : There is , however , no doubt which of these two classes of trends is the more likely to produce a solution of the real problems of the day . ' Returning to the theme later in the book , he writes of what he calls official ' art : With no serious aims and no standards of its own , the most such an art could hope for was a financial success , and this it often achieved . . . The half dozen painters who carried on the artist 's real work of invention and research were absolutely ignored . The constituent facts in the painting of our period were developed against the will of the public and almost in secret . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The architect and the painter were faced with the same long struggle against trompe l'oeil . Both had to combat entrenched styles by returning to the pure means of expression . For some four decades painter after painter makes the effort to reconquer the plane surface . We Have seen how the same strugle arose in architecture as a consequence of the demand for morality . Giedion evidently sees the role of art and architecture as a great moral struggle to produce a solution of the real problems of the day ' by finding through scientific means ? ' invention and research ' ? some permanent and pure means of expression ' from which everything temporal , transitory , and even human , will have been eliminated . Giedion 's vision is a parallel to the Marxist-Hegelian view of the end of history : that man will only become his true original self , will only reassert himself in his original nature , when he is freed from the state of alienation brought about by the tyranny of private property . Giedion 's holistic approach , inspired by Wolfflin 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an age , but the fundamental temper which produced them ' , 80 serves to underline the suggestion we made earlier that Pugin 's writings lent support to those who wished to establish a way of building that was not artificial , not marked by human imBrave New World 59 perfections , and which represented some inescapable but not yet fully appreciated or achieved reality . Not only is there a view that art and architecture are an inevitable reflection of something else : but it is clear that it is that other thing to which the critic is really committed . Whereas Pugin was at least honest with us about what that other thing was ? a society dominated by the Catholic Church in the form she had taken in the Middle Ages ? subsequent critics have often been far less clear . We are left to guess from hints in their writings that it is some utilitarian , egalitarian pattern of society inspired by the current progressive orthodoxies and alleged to be the true destiny of man . In his booklet , In Search of Cultural History , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as characteristic of the writers we have been discussing . He claimed that the cultural historian will not deny that the success of certain styles may be symptomatic of changing attitudes , but he will resist the temptation to use changing styles and changing fashions as indicators of profound psychological changes . The fact that we can not assume such automatic connections makes it more interesting to find out if and when they may have existed . " In challenging what he called the belief in the Hegelian wheel and in the need to survey the apparently God-given separate aspects of a culture from one privileged centre ' , Gombrich concluded that : This Hegelian wheel is really a secularized diagram of the Divine plan ; the search for a centre that deter-mines the total pattern of a civilization is consequently no more , but also no less , than the quest for an initiation into God 's ways with man . ' " Giedion 's book , Mechanization Takes Command , a Contri-bution to Anonymous History , 1948 , extends the ideas developed in Space , Time and Architecture . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transitory ' categories is , again , an important part of Giedion 's technique . The urgency with which this doctrine is propagated derives from the identification of art with life itself and from the consequent belief that art must be real ' , must not be a style or a creative fantasy developing its own internal traditions . This view is clearly expressed in the following condemnation of // nineteenth-century poetry and interior design : No less than the poetry of the ruling taste , intimate surroundings were created reflectively . Lacking was the leap into the unknown , the inventive . A powerful side of the nineteenth century is here revealed : the mask-like . Its view of real life is as deceptive as that of a wax museum.i83 This passage also reminds us of the extent to which Giedion believes that the artist 's capacity for reflecting on a tradition will have a stultifying rather than a creative impact on his work , will prevent rather than stimulate invention . Giedion 's ideal is , once more , that old chimera : the tabula rasa . He writes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it was necessary temporarily to forget everything and begin afresh , as if no chair had ever before been built . ' S4 This pursuit of novelty meant that in the 1920s for the first time since the eighteenth century , the room and its contents were felt as a single entity ' . This absurd claim , which ignores the countless interior designers of the nineteenth century from Pugin to Guimard , is a consequence of the high valuation which Giedion places on novelty ' , which leads him to insist that modern design must always be doing something totally new even when it is evident that it is not . The attack on tradition seems to be related to the view we identified earlier that art is life . This view also tends to narrow rather than broaden our possibilities of enjoyment , since it leads us to withdraw our sympathies from cultural phenomena produced in societies of which we may happen to disapprove on political , moral , or religious grounds . The Empire Style is a key example . Giedion disapproves of it both because he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he disapproves , Napoleon , and also because it re-uses symbolic forms in new contexts . We see here how the determinist and historicist belief that particular forms must be irretrievably rooted in a particular period and way of life rules out the possibility that the forms could acquire different meanings in different contexts . The important section of the book which develops this argument is called Napoleon and the Devaluation of Symbols ' . t In it Giedion claims that what takes place in the // Empire style is nothing other than a devaluation of symbols . As Napoleon devaluated nobility , so he devaluated ornament . ' 85 Furthermore , the Empire Style was socially unacceptable because it somehow conflicted with the demands of reality ' , that is to say it did not conform to Giedion 's notions of what life ought to have been like at the time : Percier and Fontaine , and the Empire style they created in all its ramifications , yield the key to an understanding of the nineteenth century . They are the first representatives of the ruling taste , which pushed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a thing . ' 86 Giedion praises William Morris for reacting against this tradition , yet hails him not as a designer of superlative brilliance and imagination developing from medieval and early Renaissance traditions , but as someone who made a moral stand against the lack of reality ' which is supposed to characterize earlier nineteenth-century design : The circle around William Morris strives for morally pure forms.i87 Yet those who chose to imitate Morris failed to sustain his high reforming tone , and thus the moral purity of Morris 's teaching was lost as it became reconciled to the ruling taste ' .88 Another aspect of the ruling taste ' which particularly worries Giedion is what he calls cushion furniture ' . He finds untruthfulness and unreality expressed , for example , in the way in which it conceals its structure , and he interprets this as evidence of deep inner unrest . However , he feels that modern art has now supplied us with the key ' to such problems : The Surrealists have given us keys to the psychic unrest that haunted mechanized ornament , cushion furniture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FURNEAUX JORDAN If Giedion stands as a key example of the interpretation of architecture through the Zeitgeist , Robert Furneaux , Jordan is a striking example of the vulgar sociological interpretation . Jordan 's Victorian Architecture ( 1966 ) is not a book for people interested in the achievements of Victorian architects , but rather a potted analysis of architectural history in terms // of the dominance and succession of ruling classes.t Like Pevsner 's Pioneers of the Modern Movement , it is fundament-ally a plea for the Modern Movement and ends up , surprisingly , with photographs of Pevsner 's favourite modern German buildings by Behrens and Gropius . In fact the book is only ostensibly about Victorian architecture : he does not analyse or describe any buildings in detail and , an astonishing lacuna , there is not a single plan in the whole book and certainly nothing so advanced as a cross-section . It is in a way unfair to serious scholars like Viollet-le-Duc or Pevsner to include in a book which discusses their work an account of a popular journalist like Jordan . However , we should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because of its undoubted influence on students and on the general public as the only book available on its subject , and secondly , because it is a low vulgarization of ideas which had been originally propounded by Pevsner himself. * The prerequisite for such a history of nineteenth- and early twentieth-century art is to divide it up so that it reflects an incessant class struggle between the haves ' and the have-nots ' . It is a false and even inhuman view , since in ignoring the individual it ignores the delicate and infinitely subtle nuances and gradations of English society which have formed the sub-ject of so much English literature from at least the eighteenth century to the present day . Nevertheless , Jordan pursues relentlessly his simple idea that there must be an artistic parallel to the struggle of workers against masters . Thus romanticism is seen as a revolt against the aristocracy : In the nineteenth century the romantic . . . was still , as always , a rebel against aristocracy and academic traditions ' , 90 while the anecdotal sentiment of Victorian painting helped to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years later ' .9 ' Romanticism is also the beat culture of its day ' .92 In fact , romanticism is anything of which Jordan happens to approve : for example , each of the names in the following list was opposed in some way or other to what we would call " the Establishment " ' : they are Turner , Constable , Girtin , Walter Scott , Samuel Palmer , Blake , Shelley , Keats , Coleridge , Wordsworth , Byron , Charlotte Yonge , Pugin , Butterfield , Gilbert Scott , Pater , Christina Rossetti , the six pre-Raphaelites , Ruskin , Morris , Newman , Keble , Carlyle , Emily Bronte , the Brownings and Tennyson ' .93 Certainly all these expressed dissatisfaction with the state of the world : in the case of the Christians in the list this is scarcely surprising , since the doctrine of the Fall causes every Christian to believe that the world is imperfect . It is erroneous , however , to assume that anyone who expresses this dissatisfaction for whatever reason becomes necessarily an ally of socialism . The list @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such richly diverse talents on the grounds of their alleged opposition to a never-defined Establishment ; it is particularly misleading when it includes men like Walter Scott , Wordsworth , Coleridge , Newman , and Tennyson , all of whom eventually preached differing versions of a kind of High Toryism . The loose language and slipshod scholarship , which everywhere goes with vulgar Marxism and with its dichotomy of society into workers ' and masters ' , is typified in the following passage , by no means extreme compared with others in the book , but sufficiently condensed and self-contained to make a suitable quotation : With the shift from an agricultural to an industrial England , an old and well-defined society vanished . On the one hand there had been the gentry ? nobility , squirearchy and professions ; on the other there had been the peasantry . ( Symbolically the Reform Act of 1832 marks the passing of the former , the Education Act of 1870 the passing of the latter . ) The gentry had for too long been the patrons of a polite ' and elegant classicism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fireplace or Georgian doorway ; while the peasantry had been the patrons of the pedlar , of the ancient crafts and those immemorial ways of building that we call the vernacular . In fact the Industrial Revolution by no means killed off the old aristocratic society , since many of the nobility grew // rich from its proceeds . The old society in England was never well defined ' because , unlike continental society , it allowed for movement up and down the social scale and consequent ambiguity of social status . If one had to range classes against each other , instead of setting gentry against peasantry one might with equal ( i.e. with very little ) justice choose to set the nobility and the peasantry together against the commercial and professional classes who were the newcomers ' . It is also absurd to suggest that Georgian design was a socially divisive force , since there can have been few styles so lacking in political overtones and few which have become such a norm throughout a social hierarchy , so that basically the only differ-ence between the sash-windows inserted into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of size . Furthermore , it is doubtful how far the peasantry were in a position to give patronage to any form of building . Rural vernacular buildings on the country estates depended on farmers and landowners , industrial vernacular on professional men and industrialists , so the idea that there is some deep class hostility between Georgian and vernacular is pure fantasy . This fantasy is rooted in the author 's populistic chauvinism which believes that there is some permanent essentially English way of building which has been forced beneath the surface as a result of the importation of foreign tastes and which can only be recovered after the socialist revolution . It is a view which echoes Cobbett 's belief that the peasantry were the true Englishmen while the higher classes were foreigners , i.e. Normans . Thus in Jordan 's view the buildings of England from the early seventeenth to the early nineteenth centuries ? from Inigo Jones to John Soane ? ' do after all represent only an imported art . They are part only of an aristocratic cul-ture , not part of the long vernacular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people ' .95 But what can it mean to say , for example , that Wren 's City churches , which were the pride of the prosperous commercial parishes of the seventeenth-century City of London , or that the red-brick houses of hop-growers and doctors in Georgian Farnham , or that Adam 's Edinburgh University , or Soane 's Dulwich Gallery , are all aristocratic and not native ? What can it mean , moreover , to argue that Pugin 's and Barry 's New Palace of Westminster , as // compared with Nash 's Carlton House Terrace , symbolizes the change from an aristocratic to a democratic art ' ? 96 It can mean nothing at all , since Barry 's masterpiece is in a far more luxurious and alien style than any Georgian public building . Jordan 's hatred of those whom he chooses to regard as aristocrats certainly does not help him to make discriminating judgements : thus he observes of Ashridge Park and Culzean , Eastnor , Belvoir , Killy Moon , and East Cowes castles that they are houses which became outmoded ultimately , less because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because of their inherent unreality and absurdity , than because the sort of people of whom they were built were fortunately eliminated from society ' .97 The first four houses were built for peers , so they inevitably offend Jordan , but Killy Moon was built for Colonel William Stewart , M.P. , and East Cowes by the architect Nash for his own occupation . Soldiers , politicians , and architects have scarcely been eliminated from society , even in Communist countries . What , too , does Jordan mean by outmoded ' ? In the sense that styles always change , then the houses are necessarily outmoded , but he specifically excludes that interpretation . Nor is it easy to interpret his censure in terms of function , since Eastnor , Belvoir , and Killy Moon are all privately inhabited houses , Culzean is successfully run by the National Trust for Scotland and is also used for entertaining state visitors , Ashridge is the college it always looked like even when it was a private house , while , ironically , the only one that has been demolished is East @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's view implies that a work of art loses its value if its original patron is dead or if his descendants no longer wield political power . Another passage from Victorian Architecture will show the intellectual and moral muddle consequent upon the belief that the unrealized potentialities of the emergent Zeitgeist or of society provide a ? basis for the assessment of works of art : But if we take everything into account ? the social as well as the architectural implications of the Red House ? its significance was profound . Until then the architecture of the great Victorian houses had consisted mainly of the imposition of new stylistic variations upon basically eighteenth-century themes . With the Red House , with Philip Webb , // with the emergence of the young Norman Shaw and with Morrisian ideals of craftsmanship hovering , as it were , in the wings , the change is obvious . Far off we can sniff the twentieth century upon the wind . For one thing the change was social . It was a change of patronage . If men like Barry had troubled themselves to establish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than recognition by them that the eighteenth-century class structure was trying to perpetuate itself into a century where , clearly , it was destined to die . Barry and his like loved a lord , and built for lords . But the cool , rational eighteenth-century mind ? concerned with taste ' but indifferent to what others thought  - -  was no longer enough . Barry , through architecture , had to make , for his patrons , the last great gesture . These London palaces of the Victorian hostesses , these country mansions of the big house parties , were meant to express social grandeur . And this last self-assertion of a dying aristoc-racy was necessarily vulgar . The aristocratic principle could no longer be taken for granted ; it had to draw attention to itself . 98 First of all the Red House . It is quite untrue to suggest that planning remained essentially Georgian or symmetrical till 1859 . The free plan was the creation of the eighteenthcentury Picturesque movement , as developed in the work of Nash and carried into the early Victorian period by an archi-tect like Salvin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guilty of the glum planning of the Red House where all the principal rooms face north . The Red House did not establish a change of patronage ' . Had no commoner ever commissioned a house before ? What , for example , was Thomas Hope doing when , supported like Morris by a commercial fortune , he commissioned his Duchess Street and Deepdene houses and designed special furniture and fittings for them because , so he claimed , he could find none of suffic-ient craftsmanship and quality in the shops ? 99 Yet no one has claimed that we can sniff the twentieth century ' at Duchess Street . It is also untrue , of course , to suggest that elaborate country houses were designed only for the dying aristocracy ' . They appealed to a tremendous variety of clients : nobility , gentry , nouveaux riches , artists , architects , politicians , and one simply can not tell by looking at them which were built for whom , though some will probably look vulgar to us and others will not . ' // Jordan believes that in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change of an almost biological order , a change in Man 's attitude to the whole world outside himself ' . too In the dawn of this age the Gothic Revival , indeed any revival , was particularly reprehensible ; thus he writes : An artificially revived architecture was the natural corollary of an artificially revived religion . ' tot There is no pleasing Mr. Jordan . Take C. R. Cockerell , who designed few churches or country houses , those building types of which Jordan so frequently disapproves : though more at home in aristocratic circles than many of his fellow architects , Cockerell did not give himself up to country-house practice but chose rather to bring dignity and quality to the premises of banks and commercial companies and , indeed , established the image of a bank that has survived in most people 's minds until the present time . Perhaps it is just that Jordan disapproves of banks , but for him Cockerell was clearly as far removed as could be from the realities of the century in which he lived ... Cockerell 's contribution to the life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and upon our life is precisely nil ' . 102 What , then , is the nature of this influence that Jordan believes that architects must exert ? How is it to be measured ? Did Michelangelo exert it , or Robert Adam , or Mies van der Rohe ? What , in fact , are the kinds of things that we can say about architecture ? In answering that question we are helped by Jordan 's book which shows us clearly many of the kinds of things that we can not reasonably say . We have only spent this long with his book because it represents so completely the prejudices of the collectivist , anti-artistic , ideological viewpoint . In 1966 Pevsner wrote in the Annual Report of the Victorian Society : I want to use my Chairman 's page to praise a new book which you should all possess . Robert Furneaux Jordan with his Pelican Victorian Architecture has at last provided the right introduction to a subject which is so close to our hearts .

Pevsner 's own writings in order to understand how i speak with such high praise about this wrong-headed n doing so we will fit the last stone into the bridge pans the century between Pugin and Pevsner . Only by throwing into relief the individual oneness of any given period or style or nation , and the logical coherence of all its utterances in the most varied fields of human activity , will the historiographer in the end be able to make his reader discover what form a certain problem must take at the present moment .

Chesterton , Robert Browning , 1903 , pp. 6-7 . PART III Pevsner 1 . EARLY WRITINGS The scholarship of Sir Nikolaus Pevsner is so rich and capac-ious , his work so varied , extensive , and inclusive of so many of the different approaches we have been outlining , that analysis of his achievement illuminates a whole field of modern architectural history . Born in Leipzig in 1902 , he was educated at the universities of Leipzig , Munich , Berlin , and Frankfurt . He specialized early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on German Baroque architecture by 1924 . He was influenced by two contrasting accounts of Italian sixteenth- and seventeenth-century art : Werner Weisbach 's Der Barock als Kunst der Gegenreformation of 1921 , and Wilhelm Finder 's lectures on Mannerism which he attended in 1922-4 . His first major scholarly article , called Gegenreformation and Manierismus ' , appeared in 1925 in the Repertorium fur Kunstwissenschaft . This important paper not only defined the painting of Mannerism for the first time , but also established the position which Pevsner has maintained ever since as one of the most significant continuators of the line descending from Burckhardt and Wolfflin . From the former he inherits his insistence on art history as an aspect of cultural and social history , from the latter a belief that in terms of art-historical method the spirit or style of the age is more important than the individual and varying achievements of great artists . Thus in summing up the theme of the paper in 1968 , Pevsner emphasizedthat Pontormo , Federigo Zuccari , // Barocci and Tintoretto all have essential features in common and that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same period ' . ' What Pevsner means by the spiritual state of Italy ' is made clear enough in his summary of some Counter-Reformation personalities and ideas , which was drawn from Pastor 's The History of the Polies and coloured by a conventional North European or Protestant idea of Jesuitry ' . Thus Pevsner 's chilling picture of the Jesuits where every motion of individual will must be forcibly repressed ' and where the attitude of every subordinate is one of total passivity ' , ' merely echoes Wolfflin 's idea that the Jesuits forced their spiritual system on the individual and made him sacrifice his rights to the idea of the whole ' . ' Pevsner establishes a pattern somewhat carelessly in the religious sphere , and then transposes it arbitrarily to a description of a style of painting . With his own picture of the spiritual state of Italy ' before him , Pevsner decides that there must be precise analogies to it in painting though he never explains why there should be . In Gegenreformation and Manierismus ' he simply states : Here again the parallel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suppression of the individual significance of the human being lies at the heart of the last phase of Michelangelo 's work . The mature art of Tintoretto ( born 1528 ) and Barocci ( born 1526 ) subordinates the human figure to an abstract linear schema ; and in the work of Vasari ( born 1511 ) , Salviati ( born 1510 ) , Zuccaro ( born 1529 ) and his school , the Bolognese and the Milanese , the individual form loses its significance in favour of unmanageably crowded or decoratively-ordered pictorial elements . This negation of the individual significance of the human being , this constraint which submerges it in a welter of forms , stretches it out of its natural shape , or immobilizes it in heavy draperies , constitutes the deepest and most important link between the art of Mannerism and the dominant ideas of the age of the Counter-Reformation. 4 That Mannerist art suppresses the individual significance of the human being is , however unlikely , a point that could be debated ; but surely the whole tradition of Christian spirituality is of its very nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like Bronzino and E1 Grecq really immobilize the human being in heavy draperies , and even if they do can it really make sense to see it as a reflection of the spifit which produced the Spiritual Exercises of St. Ignatius Loyola ? After // all , artistic creation has its own internal traditions and is not simply a reflex of events outside the artistic sphere . But there is yet more for which the Jesuits are held responsible : Pevsner refers to the Jesuit attitude to human weakness and sin ' as one where Tolerance was the rule , especially where powerful people were concerned . Rather forgive too much than give a soul up for lost . Only in cases of genuine heresy , i.e. wilful obstinacy , was rigour considered essential . Here too is the germ of a Baroque characteristic : moral relativism . " The language again suggests a lack of familiarity with the customs and doctrines of the Church he is writing about : in this case the sacrament of penance which alone is the context within which the priest has the power to forgive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the future . Exactly what is meant by the moral relativism ' of the Baroque , or how it could be discerned in a style of painting , is not made clear . Instead , in a passage which shows how free Pevsner can sometimes be in the construction of parallels between the various spheres of life , he passes on to the character of St. Pius V. This pope is supposed to represent the quintessence of all this jesuitry since his life was a model of asceticism .... At midday , he would take bread soup , two eggs and half a glass of wine ; in the evening vegetable soup , salad , shellfish and boiled fruit . ' This quite nourishing and substantial fare is described as an astonishing state of affairs which was not the product of the austerity of one individual . The whole city seems to have experienced a crisis of introspection . This is proved not only by Michelangelo 's last style as a sculptor , exactly contemporary with the pontificate of Pius V , or by the fact that he offered to build @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the failure of the Roman people as a whole to react in any way against the prevailing austerity.6 Pevsner 's argument here is absolutely explicit : knowing Michelangelo 's late style as a sculptor enables us to prove ' that it must ' have been accompanied by a crisis of introspection ' throughout the city of Rome ; and we have already deduced this crisis from knowledge of the Pope 's eating habits . Such schematic analysis , guided by a theory rather than by documentary evidence , is characteristic of the great tradition of Hegelian Geis tesgeschich te but is particularly // unconvincing when applied to an artist of the gigantic stature and individuality of Michelangelo , whose stylistic development was probably more inward than that of any other great European artist . Indeed , he was strongly opposed politically to his Medici patrons in Florence . Something else for which jesuitry is held responsible is eroticism , because only an age preoccupied with metaphysical objectives could have witnessed the introduction of lasciviousness into the major arts ' . Yet surely medieval spirituality was no less metaphysical ? In fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the spirit of the age , Pevsner points out the total absence of eroticism in the most important Mannerists , Tintoretto , Bassano , El Greco , Barocci , Cerano , Zuccaro and Calvaert ' . ' Here , then , Pevsner 's belief in the Zeitgeist has led him to support Wolfflin 's view that What matter are not the individual products of an age but the fundamental temper which produced them ' , ' since what Pevsner is saying is that the fundamental temper ' of the age must have been erotic even if the individual products ' happened not to be . Many of the arguments and historical or religious analogies brought forward in this article were repeated in an important essay on The Architecture of Mannerism ' published more than two decades later . The different styles of Sanmicheli , Giulio Romano , Peruzzi , Michelangelo , Vasari , and Ammanati were all explained away as a consequence of the familiar Jesuit rigorous enforcement of no longer self-understood dogma ' . What individualism had been developed by the Renaissance ' , Pevsner argued , was to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The essay contains many sensitive and illuminating accounts of individual buildings , and for that reason has been read with pleasure and profit by several generations of students ; but it was undoubtedly generated by the belief that the forms of the buildings were merely emanations of the spirit of the age , and that the historian 's role was to discern and disclose that inarticulate spirit working below the surface of particular events . Pevsner complained on the first page that Englishmen had never done this , that they had never been prepared to summon up what he called the final essence distilled out of all the individual qualities of all the leading // personalities of one particular age ' . He argued that , for example , Hobbes 's and Spinoza 's philosophy , Bernini 's and Rembrandt 's art , Richelieu 's and Cromwell 's statecraft have certain fundamentals in common , and on these we can establish a Baroque style of exact meaning . England has been characteristically slow in accepting this working hypothesis . " ' There is inevitably a certain amount of arbitrariness in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hobbes and Rembrandt . What is important for our purposes is the clear assumption that there is a spirit ' or essence ' which pervades and dominates all intellectual , artistic , and social activity . Artists are not individuals with unique imaginations and talents , but are only manifestations of this allpervasive spirit or essence . Having established in 1925 the existence of Mannerism as the style of the Italian sixteenth century , Pevsner went on to publish in the same journal three years later a paper called Beitrage zur Stilgeschichte des Fruh- and Hoch-barock ' in order to clarify his ideas on the seventeenth century . It is an interesting and unusual study which , although ostensibly concerned with Stilgeschichte ' , concentrates on broad theories about religion , science , and politics with very little emphasis on works of art . The theories were derived in general from Pastor , Ranke , Dollinger , and Weber , and to them Pevsner brings a view of religion familiar in the Protestant north ? the countries of the Gothic cathedrals , the Reformation , and the Gothic Revival . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , believes in its heart of hearts that real Christianity was essentially medieval . This belief could have been acquired , ironically , from Christian architects like Pugin and Street who were bent on recovering the lost essence of Christian design which they believed had existed in the Middle Ages . The view was echoed by Emile Male in the closing words of his L'Art religieux de la fin du moyen age en France ( 1908 ) : Henceforth there would be no Christian Art , only Christian artists ' ; " and has reappeared in new guise in the church today where it is fashionable to assume that the liturgical arrangements of the Early Christians represent some kind of permanent ideality undefiled by artificial accretions . Male , however , changed his views as a result of reading Weisbach 's Der Barock // als Kunst der Gegenreformation . Thus eleven years later he produced his own important study of L'Art religieux apres le Concile de Trente . Pevsner , however , has never changed his views on this subject . In Beitrage zur Stilgeschichte des Friih-und Hoch-barock ' 12 he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the true realization of the infinity of the universe the idea of direct dependence on a personal God inevitably receded from the human consciousness . ' In An Outline of European Architecture ( 1943 ) he was to take the even more Puginian line of dating the collapse of Christianity to the early fifteenth century . Describing church plans by Michelozzo and Brunelleschi he wrote : For a central plan is not an other-worldly , but a this-worldly conception . The prime function of the mediaeval church had been to lead the faith-ful to the altar . In a completely centralized building no such movement is possible . The building has its full effect only when it is looked at from the one focal point . There the spectator must stand and , by stand-ing there , he becomes himself the measure of all things ' . Thus the religious meaning of the church is replaced by a human one . 13 Once again , a sketchy picture of medieval religion is used as a basis for predicting the type of architecture which must have expressed it within the all-pervasive essence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prime function of the mediaeval church was to lead the faithful to the altar ' - leads him to assume that a centralized church without a long nave leading to the altar must somehow be non-Christian . The same essentially Puginian view that the Renaissance struck a blow at the Christian faith is stated categorically in The Leaves of Southwell ( 1945 ) . Describing the beauty of the naturalistically carved capitals of the late thirteenth-century Chapter House at Southwell Minster , Pevsner claims that The Renaissance in the South two hundred years later was perhaps once again capable of such worship of beauty , but no firm faith was left to strengthen it . " ' Again , in the descriptive notes he contributed to Sacheverell Sitwell 's German Baroque Sculpture ( 1938 ) , he allows unsup-ported assumptions about religion to account for artistic // forms . He claims that the Protestant is led to direct and unaided intercourse with God ; Catholic religious experience is chiefly communal ' , 15 and that this leads to a fundamentally different approach of Protestantism and Catholicism to the visual arts ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Franciscan spirituality , of St. Bernard , and , in particular , of Thomas a Kempis 's The Imitation of Christ , all of which formed the basis of nineteenth-century Protestant spirituality . Pevsner did not , of course , invent this view but merely inherited it from the nineteenth century which had actually produced doctored Protestant ' editions of a Kempis , still being printed today , which omitted his fourth and concluding chapter , About the Blessed Sacrament ' . The fallacious antithesis between Protestant and Catholic religious experience is used in the same paragraph , in a way with which we have now become familiar , to construct a Zeitgeist which will account for German Baroque sculpture : Therefore the apogee of Protestant art is music , of Catholic art sculpture , painting and decoration . ' This view was not developed in German Baroque Sculpture but assumed unexpected prominence five years later in An Outline of European Architecture . Chapter Six concludes with a resounding panegyric on Protestantism . The modern world , he argued , is that of Protestantism ' . The Protestant countries ... created @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the spiritual world . What the cathedral had been to the Middle Ages , the symphony was to the nineteenth century . " ' Now it is no part of the argument of the present book that Protestants can or can not write symphonies or design buildings , but the statement that the Protestant countries produced the symphony must be challenged by simple facts . Of the principal composers of symphonies in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries ? Haydn , Mozart , Beethoven , Schubert , Berlioz , Mendelssohn , Schumann , Liszt , Brahms , Tchaikovsky , Dvorak , Bruckner , and Mahler ? all were Catholics save for Beethoven , Schumann , Mendelssohn , Brahms , and Tchaikovsky . Beethoven and Tchaikovsky were scarcely Protestants whatever else they may have been ? Beethoven might be described as a lapsedCatholic deist ? while Mahler was a Catholic convert , and Liszt received the four minor orders of the Catholic church . Our description of Pevsner 's methods in the formative years from 1925 has suggested his essentially determinist approach to art and architecture . Given a few selected abstrac-tions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ period , he will postulate the kind of art and architecture it must have produced . In German Baroque Sculpture he wrote of the German cultural revival of 1650 ? 1750 that followed the Thirty Years War : The causes are manifold . Some econ-omic and political reasons will be hinted at later , but the root of the revival must be found in a harmony between the style demanded by the century , and the inborn aesthetic , expres-sional qualities of the German . ' 17 We have hinted before that nationality has occasionally been claimed as the decisive determinant of artistic style . The imperatives of race or nation , familiar in modern German thought , were made the subject of a whole book , The English-tress of English Art ( 1955 ) . The theme of this book had been occupying Pevsner since before his arrival in this country in the 1930s . He began to deliver lectures on the subject in 1941 at Birkbeck College in the University of London , and chose to expand the theme when , after the war , he was invited by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the text of these lectures which , doubled in size and attractively illustrated , he published in 1955 . In The Englishness of English Art Pevsner analyses what he considers to be the principal stylistic characteristics of English painting , sculpture , and architecture from the eleventh century to the present day and attempts to account for them in terms of national character ' . But in order to sustain the argument that there must be some unconscious synthesis , some underlying uniformity which will be a reflection of national character , the historian has to bring to his subject all sorts of assumptions about the national character , language , religion , politics , and so on . And these assumptions , unlike the art-historical assumptions , are rarely analysed or defended . Thus Pevsner brings forward a fair amount of evidence to support his notion that excessive length ' is a feature of English architecture as in , for example , the perhaps rather strained comparison between the fate Elizabethan Combin-ation Room at St. John 's Collcge , Cambridge , and a Georgian terrace in Kensington . But the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for granted and are supported by little evidence . Thus he mentions more than once that the national character is reflected in a language that is blunt and direct , and produces as evidence the contrast between the Italian word costoletta ' and its English counterpart chop ' . There is every reason , however , for choosing the more accurate and elegant little word cutlet ' as the counterpart of costoletta ' . However , our fundamental concern is not with these minor queries but with the impression left by the emphasis on national character or Volksgeist as a determinant of artistic style without due regard to artistic tradition and the imaginative and intellectual powers of the individual artist . Pevsner does adhere unqualifiedly to the methods which is characteristic of him , but there are times when he acknowledges that it is inadequate : Sir John Soane 's style is too personal , too idiosyncratic , to fit any system of period or national classification completely . It is the same as with Hawksmoor in the early eighteenth and Butterfield in the mid-nineteenth century . These men were laws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was Shakespeare ? and they can only tenuously be tied to the categories of national character . 18 An interpretation of English culture which has to leave out our greatest poet and three of our most significant architects is a very strange one , but presumably in line with that amoition defined at the beginning of the book of finding out what all works of art and architecture of one people have in common , at whatever time they may have been made ' " The postulate of a kind of collective unconscious Kunstwollen lies behind Pevsner 's little book The Leaves of Southwell , where he asserts a connection between the midthirteenth-century writings of the German Albertus Magnus , De Animalibus and De Vegetabilibus , and the late thirteenthcentury carved capitals of the Chapter House at Southwell . But after ten pages of discussion and quotation he returns to the spirit of the age as the explanation and norm of artistic creation : So we are left with the only explanation which historical experience justifies ; the existence of a spirit of the age , operating in art as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
