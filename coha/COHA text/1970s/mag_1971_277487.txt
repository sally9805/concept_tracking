THE PAINTER GABRIEL by Donald Newlove. 313 pages . McCall . $6.95 . <P> <P> Nether sections of Avenue B provide the Boschian landscape of Hell . They swarm with dreadful objects : flaking $65 walk-ups and urine-stained corridors , a cat skinned live in the alley , bums and glue-sniffing Puerto Rican delinquents , burst trash bags and rusty fire escapes . All these things , lit by the glare of burning cars and the flash of pot or amphetamine , are the backdrop to one of the best fictional studies of madness , descent and purification that any American has written since Ken Kesey 's One Flew Over the Cuckoo 's Nest . Donald Newlove clearly set out to write a first novel about demoniac society . He has produced a combined morality play and grimoire , or devil 's hornbook , in which every creature is experienced with hilarious or dreadful concreteness . <P> Gabriel the painter is its central character , a loquacious and unrecognized artist who buys time to paint his apocalyptic visions by turning out cheap still lifes of Chianti bottles to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stoned descendant of Joyce Carey 's Gulley <P> Jimson , a prey to the same tumescent , Blakean mysticism as Jimson , and an example of the outsider used as a corrective lens through which human absurdities may be studied . <P> In the country of the mad , the creative loon is king . Around Gabriel cluster amiable freaks , all of whom , like him , define a precarious balance by opposing their craziness to the paranoia of the outside city . There is Walter , an amateur Polish historian , whose East Village flat is filled to the ceiling with grimy bales of newspaper , all destined to be cross-indexed and given to a university in Warsaw ; Dulcie Kraft , a Texas scientologist ; Beamer , a novelist writing a book about morning sickness , " privately printed and sent only to monasteries " ; Orville , a pot dealer and " passing student of Eastern cosmic consciousness , " and so on . <P> Does the list seem familiar ? It is . But if Newlove applies his Instant Identifreak Kit too patly and produces some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many of his human inventions swell like bullfrogs from the sheer pressure of his linguistic vitality . Gabriel himself , with his constantly thwarted desire for transcendence and his unstoppable monologues on everything from sex to Homeric mythology , is a memorable caricature : beside him , the Beat heroes of ' 50s fiction look not merely anemic but ignorant . Gabriel , simply , is romanticism cubed : " Scrape your brain bare , like a battery electrode , expose your nerves like a bush of copper . Get ready to sing or die . Or maybe both ! And all this out here , these roofs and smokestacks , will turn into light-and you 'll see right through them-because they 'll no longer be necessary to support the illusion of our lives . " In its way , Newlove 's muddy , inflamed picaresque novel is a remarkable performance . Even so , as his large promise develops , the author may one day need to reflect on the possibility that less is more .               @ @ @ @ @ @
