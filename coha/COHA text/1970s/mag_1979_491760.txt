I BREAK INTO THE BIG TIME Time has dimmed memories of John Fleming Wilson , novelist and playwright , but in the years just before World War I he was a famous man . I methim by accident . As art director of Boys ' Life , I had assigned myself to illustrate one of Wilson 's short stories , and I needed a good look at a life raft . Edward Cave , the editor , suggested I ask Wilson for help , so I went over to his Broadway hotel and sent up my name . After half an hour a short , thick man with a brutish face came lumbering across the lobby and pumped my hand . " Wilson , " he said , " John Fleming Wilson . Let 's have some breakfast . " Slinging an arm across my shoulders , he propelled me into the bar . He ordered a double whiskey and two fried eggs , and the same for me . When I protested that I did n't drink  --  I was only 19 ? he said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 've got to live . " But he canceled my whiskey , ordering coffee instead . After he had downed his whiskey , he asked what my problem was . I told him I wanted to see a life raft before I drew one . " That 's the ticket , " he said ; " see everything , do everything . Stick with me . I 'll show it to you . " He took me in a cab to a downtown dock , and I sketched a life raft . Then we stopped in a bar , and he had a drink . He was all for going on to some other bar where , he said , the company was gayer  --  women and all  --  but I told him I had hired a model for the afternoon . So he said I should come around to his hotel early the next day , because something big was going to break for him any day now , and he was going to get me in on it . I ca n't say I liked the man , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promised to do something for me . What it was I did n't know , except that it was certainly connected with my work . At nine the next morning Wilson ushered me into his suite , saying that he had to finish a short story before we went out . He dictated to a male secretary , walking about the room , a bottle of whiskey in one hand , a glass in the other . After he had completed his story  --  it took only half an hour  --  we went over to the offices of Charles Scribner 's Sons , publishers of Scribner 's magazine . Wilson left me in the anteroom and strode into the editor 's office . An hour later he came out . " It 's all set , " he said . " We 're going to the Panama Canal to do a series of articles . I 'll write ' em , you 'll illustrate ' em . We 'll blast the canal and Davis and Pennell in the bargain . " ( Richard Harding Davis and Joseph Pennell had just done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rousing success . ) " We 're in , boy , in ! " Wilson shouted . " I 'll be the greatest writer , you 'll be the greatest illustrator . America 'll go down on its fat red knees and kiss our feet when we get through . " And he insisted that I accompany him to his favorite tavern to celebrate . When we boarded a trolley later on , he was soused and fell against the motorman . The motorman shoved him away , and Wilson cursed him . They wound up rolling in the street , pummeling each other , until some workmen and I managed to separate them . That was the beginning of a strange two months . Wilson would " show me life " almost every day . Mostly I 'd stand at a bar with him , drinking lemonade while he drank whiskey . The promise of that trip to Panama held me , so I accompanied him on his excursions , and every three or four days we 'd go up to Scribner 's and he 'd talk to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said one day . " Get yourself a pith helmet , five suits of cotton pajamas  --  that 's all they wear in the tropics  --  and sandals . And have your teeth fixed  --  in Panama they 'll rot like raw meat in summertime . " I did as he said . The next week he told me to buy a revolver . I bought that . The next week he advised me to buy a machete and a white umbrella . I did . The date of our sailing got nearer and nearer . Wilson told me he had purchased the steamer tickets ; he even gave me the name of the boat we were to sail on . I had dropped most of my own work in the excitement . I was going to be a great illustrator , like Pyle or Abbey or Remington . I packed my outfit in the special knapsack he 'd told me to buy and strapped on a mosquito netting . Two days before we were scheduled to leave I called for Wilson at his hotel . He was gone . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where his wife was , or the secretary , or the secretary 's wife . I went over to Scribner 's . Yes , of course , they knew John Fleming Wilson . A series of articles on the Panama Canal ? No . They 'd never heard of that . I was crushed . I went to my studio and sat there amidst my heaps of tropical gear . All my dreams of becoming a great illustrator , of working for the big magazines , seemed lost . I sat there , unable to rouse myself . Late that night my father came in and led me off to bed . I guess I came near to having a nervous breakdown . I could n't work , or sleep , or eat , or go out anywhere . Finally my father sent me to the mountains for a month . I lived with a farmer 's family , took long walks through the snowy countryside , and gradually calmed down . One day , after I 'd been back in the city for two or three months , Wilson came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been called away unexpectedly  --  no time to notify me . The trip was still on . I felt a surge of hope . The next night I took Eleanor Bordeaux , my girl friend from Mamaroneck , over to Wilson 's apartment in Brooklyn to help celebrate his birthday . The minRockwell was a born stage director . Here , he even poses as his own model , when he painted Henry Ford for the company 's 50th anniversary in 1953. ute I stepped in the door I knew I 'd been kidding myself . Everybody at the party was drunk ; men and women were lying together on the sofas  --  it was an orgy . I could see Eleanor was scared , so I got her out of there fast . That was the last I ever saw of John Fleming Wilson . Long afterward I heard that he had died in a fire somewhere out West . Partly because of Wilson  --  I was afraid he 'd come to my studio drunken mad  --  and partly because of the drab life at Mrs. Frothingham 's boardinghouse , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us  --  my mother and father , my brother Jarvis , and myself  --  went to Brown Lodge , a superior boardinghouse in New Rochelle . I 'd had enough of city life . The night of my arrival at Brown Lodge I went out walking with Gertrude , Mrs. Brown 's niece . As we crossed a vacant lot I tried to kiss her . She fended me off , saying , " Oh , I would n't kiss anyone unless I was engaged . " I asked , " Would you kiss me if we were engaged ? " She said yes , so I kissed her . " Well , " she said , " now we 're engaged . " Such was the custom in those days , and somehow I lacked the nerve to say no , we 're not . When Gertrude announced our engagement the next day Mrs. Brown was overjoyed . I guess I was a good prospect  --  steady , hard-working , respectable family ; earning a splendid $50 a week and aiming for more . Mrs. Brown became excessively cordial , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of brown betty at supper . Conferences were held concerning the wedding gown , a minister , and the wedding supper . Gertrude was happy , the other boarders were excited , my parents were pleased  --  I was miserable . I liked Gertrude  --  she was an awfully pretty girl  --  but I certainly did n't want to be married ; not yet anyway . Finally , after a week of dazed meandering , I led her up to the trunk room of Brown Lodge , took her hand , and said , " Gertrude , I 'm not worthy of you . I 'm no good . " " You mean you do n't want to be engaged , " said Gertrude . " No , " I said , " I 'm not worthy of you . You 're a fine girl , Gertrude ; I 'm no good , I 'm rotten . " So she gave me back the ring . Mrs. Brown took it very hard . Two or three days later Gertrude and I walked back from town together . Mrs. Brown saw us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kitchen , " Come in here ! What 're you doing with that no-good artist ? " For a studio I rented office space on the second floor of the Clovelly Building at 360 North Avenue in New Rochelle . When the office beside mine fell vacant , I rented it and knocked down the wall . The enlarged studio was the biggest I 'd ever had ; I used to feel sort of loose and airy when I contemplated it . That did n't last long , however . I met an illustrator who had recently come East from Peoria and had no place to work . " Why do n't you move in with me until you can get a place of your own ? " I said . For a few weeks the arrangement worked out well . We worked at easels at opposite ends of the room , talking when we felt like it , now and then going across the street for coffee . Then a hardware company commissioned him to do the drawings for their catalogue . The next day there were two easels set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came in . " Norm , " my studio mate said , " I want you to meet so-and-so . I 've brought him on from Peoria to help me with the catalogue . " The following morning I found them unpacking two huge crates . " Our models , " my guest said cheerfully , displaying a handful of wrenches . During the course of the day the crates yielded an assortment of hammers , pinch bars , watering cans , rakes ( " Norm , " he said , " I wonder if you 'd mind moving into the corner . I want to set these tools out where we can see them . " ) , shovels and tin pails , paper bags of screws and nails ( " Would you put your brushes on the palette table , please ? I need that chest for these packages . " ) , a lawn mower , a wheelbarrow , and an enormous quantity of wrapping paper and excelsior . That evening , as I pulled my jacket from beneath a heap of wrenches and picked my way through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wondered where my own model would fit in . The next morning I was n't sure I 'd fit in myself . Two more crates had arrived . Somewhere behind them lurked my easel ; my chair was hidden by mounds of excelsior ; wrapping paper hid my palette table . I asked , " Could n't you throw away the crates and wrap-pings ? " " No , " he said , " we got ta send all this stuff back when we 're done with it . " " O.K. , " I said , " but I have n't got much room here . " He took the wrapping paper off my palette table and piled it underneath . " There , " he said , " how 's that ? " For two weeks I waded through tools , bags , pails , and excelsior to my dark little corner and painted to the clatter of dropped wrenches and whispered discussions of how best to portray the ball-peen hammer . Then I told a forceful friend about my situation and left for a two-week vacation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of open floor , in the center of which sat my easel like a primitive god . Somehow I never again had those airy , loose , lightheaded feelings when confronted by the empty room . At this time I was working almost exclusively for juvenile magazines , so most of my models were children and hard to find . Say I was doing a picture of a Rockwell knew well the appeal of a pooch in a painting , and he was an expert in coaxing them to pose . boy and a dog . To locate the right boy , I 'd have to hang about the grade schools at recess and stop little boys on the street , studying them to see whether they were the type I wanted . If I found the right boy , I had to persuade him to pose . " Gee , mister , " he 'd say , " I got ta play ball on Satiddy . I ca n't do no posin ' . " " Fifty cents an hour , " I 'd say , launching into a long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Finally I 'd cajole the boy into asking his mother . Then I had him , because most mothers thought it was just wonderful that little Clarence was going to appear in American Boy or St. Nicholas , and little Clarence would report to my studio at nine o'clock Saturday morning , ball game or no . Arranging for the dog was more complicated . First I had to discover him ; then I had to follow him to learn where his owner lived . Once I chased a dog all afternoon through vacant lots , over fences , down and up gullies , through briers , burrs , and nettles . He was a perfect mutt  --  black patch around one eye , woebegone , lanky , and rough . But he escaped through a backyard crisscrossed by clotheslines hung with clammy bed sheets . But finding the dog and the boy was nothing to posing them . You take a young mutt who 's been reared on rats and table scraps  --  there 's exuberance for you ! I 'd set him on the model stand , pushing him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a moment staring at me . Then he 'd catch sight of his tail out of the corner of his eye and go for it . Next it would be a flea behind his ear ; then he 'd prance about the model stand , barking at an imaginary enemy . Still , I had to have dogs . John Ames Mitchell , editor of the old humor magazine Life , once told me that the most popular subjects for magazine covers were , first , a beautiful woman , second , a kid , and third , a dog . Later on , when I was doing Post covers , I 'd receive letters from readers saying , " I love that little boy , but , oh , that dog  --  with those hu-man , beseeching eyes . " Occasionally I 'd need some other kind of animal . Once I was doing a picture with a duck in it . I called the local butcher and asked him to bring me a fat one . When he set it on the floor of the studio , it waddled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get it to pose for me ? " I asked the butcher . " Get me a hammer and some wide-topped tacks , " he said . " I do n't want to hurt the duck , " I said . " Do n't worry , " he said . " You just hold the duck where you want him . " So I did , and he began to tack the duck 's feet to the model stand . " Hey , " I said , " stop ! " " It do n't hurt him , " he said , continuing to drive in tacks while the duck pecked cheerfully at the hammer . " You could pound a railroad spike in the web of his foot . Do n't have no feeling there . " So all afternoon I painted the duck while it stood tacked to the stand , quacking and heaving itself up on its legs . After a while it stopped trying to move and just stood there looking at me . " Quack , " it would say indignantly . " Quack , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the livestock , but it was n't easy to get them to stay put . I 'd prop a boy 's feet into a running position with bricks or boards , making him as comfortable as possible . Five minutes later he 'd begin to squirm : " Say , mister , you almost through ? " Ten minutes later : " I got ta go home , mister . " Then : " Gee , my back hurts . You done yet ? " After 25 minutes , when I 'd tell him to rest , he 'd put on his coat . " Hey , " I 'd say . " I 'll need you all morning . " " All morning ! " " Come on , 500 an hour . You 've only earned a quarter so far . " After two or three months of this I hit upon a useful device . At the beginning of the modeling session I 'd set a stack of nickels on a table beside my Continued on page 98 hand of the boy . The rap came once more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throat . " I 'm coming ! " the scientist called . Then to the others , " Good-bye . " " Good-bye , " his father answered . " I 'll pray for you . " " Remember you 're an Ainsley . We 'll both pray for you , " his mother told him . " God bless you , " he said , and opened the door . Not until he was clear of the house , with his foot reaching for the steps , did he remember there were no steps there . When he came to himself he was lying on the ground . As his eyes grew accustomed to the darkness , he saw that the sugar maples and picket fence were gone . He picked himself up painfully . The house was dark . The door looked as if it had been boarded up for a long time . So did the windows . And yet so real and strong remained the memory of his father and mother and the lamplit table that he pounded on the boards . " Papa ! " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house answered him . Below he could see the cold glitter of electric lights on the tanks and buildings of the secret XYT explosive line . Nearer at hand were the cemetery and the guard waiting . Well , he told himself , he could face things a little better now . His father and mother had said they would pray for him . And the boy inside of him had made his first sign of peace to the man he had become . 27 ; Big Time continued from page 69 easel . Every 25 minutes , when it came time for the model to rest , I 'd transfer five of the nickels to the other side of the table , saying , " Now that 's your pile . " The kids liked that . After two years at Brown Lodge my family and I moved to an even better boardinghouse called Edgewood Hall . It was at Edgewood Hall that I discovered three of the best models I 've ever had : Billy Paine , Eddie Carson , and a mongrel pup called Lambert . Billy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use them , and they could act . If I wanted a sad expression , a belly laugh , disdain or a sneer , they could give it to me and hold it all morning . Lambert was the thoughtful type . I 'd place him in position on the stand , and he 'd just sit there with his head cocked to one side , thinking , hour after hour . I used Billy Paine in countless illustrations and , later on , in 15 Post covers . He posed for all three of the boys in my first Post cover . When he was 13 , Billy climbed out a window in the second story of Edgewood Hall , lost his foot ing , and fell to the sidewalk below . A few days later he died . Eddie was grief-stricken . I was saddened , too . Billy was a swell kid , a regular rapscallion . I missed him a whole lot , and still do , especially when I look at the old Post covers . He was the best boy model I ever had . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of affairs , commuters , lodged at Edgewood Hall . Downtown I often saw Coles Phillips , the celebrated pretty-girl artist , or Clare Briggs , the well-known cartoonist . Almost every day on my way to work I 'd pass J.C . Leyendecker , the famous Saturday Evening Post cover artist , walking to the railroad station to catch the train for New York , where he had his studio . They made me wonder whether I was getting anywhere . Sometimes I 'd get out my portfolio and look at my work : illustrations for St. Nicholas , covers for the American Boy , Boys ' Life , Youth 's Companion , drawings for a Handbook of Camping , Tell Me Why Stories , a history book . All were for children 's books or magazines . I 'd go through the whole portfolio : $15 for this job , $10 for that , $20 here , $25 there . Who 'd ever heard of me besides a lot of kids ? I felt at a dead end  --  the same old jobs day after day , nothing new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Edgewood Hall seeking my new-found friend , Clyde Forsythe , a celebrated cartoonist . I 'd drag him away from his dinner and back to my studio . When he said something I had done was good , I believed him ; he had been a newspaperman and a cartoonist for years , and knew the commercial-art world . I should add that he was making a lot of money , owned an automobile and a motorboat , and belonged to the local yacht and tennis clubs . In short , he was established , which carried weight with me . When Clyde left his supper and came to my studio , he always managed to prop up my sagging confidence . " What 're you moaning about ? It 's a darn good picture . Get off your hands and knees and work , You 'll make it . Give it time . Hell , Lincoln was 51 before he was elected President . Give it time . " After I 'd interrupted his supper ten or twelve times , and we 'd become good friends , Clyde suggested we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a corrugated-iron barn which Remington had built so that he could do the life-size statue The Cowboy , which now stands in Fairmount Park in Philadelphia . The barn did n't look very solid , but it was big and inexpensive , so we took it . Clyde was doing a daily comic strip about a dull-witted Swedish prize fighter , Axel , and his cunning manager , Continued on following page With love . In Montane Big Time continued from page 98 Flooey . He spent about two hours a day on it . Every morning at ten o'clock he 'd come in and thread his way through my clutter of costumes , frames , model stand , canvases , paints , palette table , and props . Then he 'd sit down at his drawing table and think up an idea for his comic strip . The comic strips were n't serials then ; you had to have a complete gag every day . Axel says something to Flooey , Flooey shoves Axel , Axel shoves Flooey , and they both fall over backward . The public loved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had made a rough sketch of the gag , Clyde would show it to me , and I 'd have to laugh . It is n't easy to laugh at a comic strip every day for a whole year . I did it , though , because Clyde was my friend . After I 'd appreciated his gag , Clyde would make the finished drawings in an hour and a half or less , and he 'd be through for the day . I was eager to improve my work . At the top of my easel I painted " 100% " in gold lettering . Everything I did was going to be as good as I could make it , and I pestered Clyde to rate each picture according to a scale I had painted on mat-board and tacked to my easel : excellent , upper middle , middle , lower middle , bad . " What d' you think ? " I 'd ask him . " The kid 's not bad . Upper middle ? " " Well , yes , " he 'd say , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lopsided . I do n't think it rates more than lower middle . Not with that dog the way he is . " I guess he went through as much torture criticizing my pictures every day as I did laughing at his comic strip . He kept urging me to show my portfolio to the adult magazines and book publishers . I wanted new markets , but I was afraid to risk a refusal . I had a secret ambition : a cover on The Saturday Evening Post . The cover of the Post was  --  and still is  --  the greatest show window in America for an illustra-tor . I 'd conjure up a picture of myself as a famous illustrator , surrounded by ad-miring females , deferred to by office flunkies at the magazines , wined and dined by the Post editor , Mr. George Horace Lorimer . But the minute I thought of that name my courage failed . Mr. Lorimer had built the Post from a small family journal with a circulation in the hundreds to an influential mass magazine with a circulation in the mil-lions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't like my work ? Sup-pose he denounced me as an incom-petent ? I 'd go down , down , down . The kids ' magazines would drop me , then Continued on page 102 the dime novels and pulps would refuse to use my work , and I 'd end up doing the wrappers for penny candies . I had visions of myself as a starving wretch with a huge Adam 's apple , lying in a flophouse on the Bowery . One day , as I was mentally rolling on my cot in the flophouse , Clyde asked what I was muttering about . I told him . " Why do n't you do a cover and show it to them ? What the hell , you 're as good as anybody . Lorimer 's not the Dalai Lama . " I set to work the next morning on a painting of a handsome Gibson man in white tie and tails , leaning over the back of a sofa to kiss a gorgeous Gibson girl in evening dress . High society , just the sort of thing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I left that painting to start another : a beautiful ballerina curtsying in the glare of a spotlight . After two weeks I had both of them nearly finished . I was pretty well pleased with myself . " They 're terrible , " said Clyde . " You ca n't do a beautiful , seductive woman . She looks like a tomboy who 's been scrubbed with a rough washcloth and pinned into a new dress by her mother . Give it up . " He grabbed one of the illustrations I had just completed for a story in Boys ' Life . " Do that , " said Clyde . " Do what you 're best at . Kids . Just adapt it to the Post . Hell , they do n't want warmed-over Gibson . If they take your stuff , it 'll have to be good . You 're a terrible Gibson , but a pretty good Rockwell . " So I called in Billy Paine and set to work . I thought up six or seven ideas : two boys in baseball uniforms scoffing at another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a baby carriage ; a kids ' circus , one kid in long underwear as a strong man , another in a top hat as barker , and so on . I made finished paintings in black , white , and red of two of the ideas and rough sketches of three others . Meanwhile , I 'd been making other preparations for my trip to Philadelphia to see the editors of The Saturday Evening Post . I bought a new suit , a gray herringbone tweed , I remem ber , and a new hat , a conservative black one . The big problem was how to carry my pictures . Usually when I went to see an editor I tied up my paintings and sketches with brown paper and twine . It made a neat package , but after I 'd shown my work I had to rewrap , and while I struggled with the pictures , paper , and string , the editor would have to wait , making exasperated attempts to help me . I felt it would be bad business to keep the great Mr. Lorimer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I went to a harness maker in New Rochelle and asked him to make me a suitcase . " I want it big , " I told him , " about 30 by 40 inches and a foot thick . And inconspicuous ; I guess black would be best . " He followed my instructions conscientiously . The case was long , thick , tall , and all black  --  even the latches were painted black . It was actually a gruesome affair , but I was satisfied . So one cold morning in March of 1916 I set out for Philadelphia and the Post . As I sidled up the broad steps of the Curtis Publishing Company building  --  white marble pillars gleaming in the sun , imposing , magnificent  --  I felt my Adam 's apple sink beneath my collar . Maybe I 'd better work on the paintings some more . Then I thought of Clyde ? " You mean you did n't even go into the office ? " I asked the lobby receptionist which floor Mr. Lorimer 's office was on . Sixth . " Hold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my box , " you ca n't bring that in here . Take the freight elevator . " So I entered the reception hall of the editorial offices by the back door . When I asked to see Mr. Lorimer , the receptionist asked my business . I explained , and she said she 'd call Mr. Walter H. Dower , the art editor , and would I please sit down . There were two men in the reception hall . The secretary had greeted them as Mr. Cobb and Mr. Blythe . Golly , I thought , they must be Irvin S. Cobb and Samuel G. Blythe , the famous writers . Pretty soon Mr. Cobb came over to where I was sitting , stared quizzically at my box , tapped it lightly with his fist , and listened intently . Then he looked at me and walked back to Mr. Blythe . They put their heads together , whisper-ing . Mr. Blythe came over and examined my box . The murmured dis-cussion continued . Fi-nally Mr. Cobb said to me , " Young man , will you answer a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I said . " Tell me , " he said , looking hard at my box , " is the body in there now ? " Mr. Dower took my paintings and sketches in to Mr. Lorimer and brought word back that Mr. Lorimer would accept the two finished paintings and had O.K. 'd the three sketches for future Post covers . He added that I was to receive $75 for each cover . Wow ! All my problems , I thought , were solved . I would live in ease , comfort , and distinction for the rest of my life . I might even get married ; after all , I was n't a kid any more  --  I was 22 years old , a man both of experience and of mature judgment . I had arrived .
