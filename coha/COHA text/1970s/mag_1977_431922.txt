 | What My Readers Teach Me TIME WOUNDS ALL HEELS and you 'll get yours , Buster . " That was the first advice I offered readers of the Chicago Sun-Times , on October 16 , 1955 ? The writing style of Ann Landers has changed little since I took on the job as " human wailing wall " for the world . But some of the advice I give today would have sent my readers to bed with a bad case of the vapors back in 1955 . When hired , I was a 37-year-old amateur , green as grass , hopelessly square , distinctly underqualifiedand shot full of luck . The day I wandered into the Sun-Times " looking for something to do , " I was informed that their advice columnist , Ann Landers , had died the week before . I had never written a  | line for publication ( I did n't even own a typewriter ) , but I was invited to enter the competition for the job , along with 28 professional writers . I headed for home with an armful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sample columns later the telephone rang . " Good morning , Ann Landers , " chirped the voice . I promptly went into shock . And that 's how Eppie Lederer became Ann Landers . How could I miss ? My readers provided me with a ringside seat to life . I learned from them what the real world was all about . Dozens of good friends around the country ? authorities in medicine , psychiatry , dentistry , religion , business , politics and education ? have responded when I phoned for help with difficult questions . Without these professional consultants , I could n't have survived . I had been under the impression that only a nut would write to a newspaper about a personal problem , but I was wrong . The appeals come from every social , economic and intellectual level . Correspondents range from age 6 up to 103 . I 've been asked what to do about tax cheats , freeloading relatives , lecherous bosses , pathological liars , teen-agers who sneak the Pill , " funny uncles , " wives who cook with sherry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if they should change churches , have another baby , run for public office , get a nose job or marry for money . They want to know if it 's okay to hit a neighbor 's child " when he 's got it coming . " A man in Oklahoma longed to 1 buried in his 1939 Dodge ; he . needed to know if it was legal . ( The answer was " yes , in certain cemeteries , " but he 'd probably have to buy two lots . ) A teen-ager from Miami asked , " Is i possible for a girl to get pregnant with her clothes on ? " The variety of letters is mind ? bending . But the sameness of the gut-level inquiries never ceases t amaze me . After peeling off a few layers of protective covering , I dicern a familiar , unashamed cry fo help . Of course , I receive some phony made-up letters . But manufacture anxiety has a hollow ring ? authent cries for help have a tone of anguish that 's impossible to fake . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my suspicions . It 's mo apt to be the neat and orderly recit tion of facts . A person who is d pressed or up-tight often misspells words , writes in the margins an adds last-minute thoughts . The true measure of a hum being is how he or she treats his fellow man . And one thing I kno now that I did n't know before is th an impressive family backgroun and sterling academic credenti offer no guarantee against bad manners , shoddy standards , or gross in sensitivity to the needs and feelin of others . No situation , I now realize , too bizarre , too idiotic or too risky to be real . Somebody somewhere will do anything if he or she is lone-177 enough , desperate enough , or ( ) shed beyond the threshold of tolerance . And it does n't mean these people are kooks ? merely that they re card-carrying members of the man race . So when Ms. , Mrs. and Ir . Average Citizen , at a low point in eir lives , decide they need to write ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? although I 've been sown to get a bit hard-boiled when ( 1 ( c situation demands it . Most of the basic advice that Wins through my column reflects my midwestern small-town upbringing . Twin sister " Dear Abby " and I earned from Mama how to be responsible and productive ; from my therapist ? a sort of Jewish Lin Yutange learned " philosophy . " One lesson I try to pass on is : We are best to Ourselves when we are good to othrs . Bernard Baruch , adviser to six Presidents , put it : " One of the secrets f a long and fruitful life is to forgive everybody everything before you go o bed at night . " This is not only a beautiful philosophy but a good way to preserve our health . Anger , hate , grudges nd jealousy are self-destructive and errosive . They damage the vessels n which they 're stored , and also use p an enormous amount of energy . he haters ? like the worriers ? inariably wind up with stomach trouble or worse . Although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that ' hat I have learned about marriage : titled my molars . I believe that one marriage out of 25 is " very good , " with both parties operating on the same wavelength as friends , partners and lovers . ( I had such a marriage for many years , and it ended in divorce . Perhaps the lesson is , " No one knows what tomorrow will bring . " ) Four of those 25 marriages are " okay . " Seven are bad ? much bickering , many fights , poor communication ? but tolerable . Eight are a real drag , both parties wishing there were an easy way out . Five are disasters ? the couple share nothing , not even a bed . Yet they plug along year after year , like a pair of matched mules , sometimes turning to hard liquor or white wine , work , hockey , golf , gambling or sleeping around . I 've discovered , too , that millions of marrieds escape their boring ? or punitive ? partners by hooking their eyeballs to the TV set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I am not ashamed to admit it . There is a vast difference between abandoning one 's principles and dealing with issues in a relevant manner . Reversals in my advice reflect changes in our society . In 1955 , for example , I held the firm conviction that every girl must hang on to her virginity until marriage or death ? whichever came first . I still believe that the young woman who can approach the marriage bed with hymen intact is to be admired , but today I would not call her a tramp if she failed to do so . What I see today that I did n't see before I became Ann Landers is a generation growing up in a sexoriented culture . Yet there are those  | who say we dare n't give young people explicit information about sex because it will " encourage them to experiment . " When are the narrow , unrealistic vigilantes going to wake up and smell the coffee ? Our teenagers are already experimenting ; some 11 million of them are sexually active . Lest there be a misunderstanding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opinion , the majority of 15- , 16-and 17-year-olds are not sufficiently mature to deal with an intimate physical relationship . But they wo n't stop just because their priest , rabbi , minister , parents , teachers or Ann Landers tell them to . There were over one million teen-age pregnancies in the United States in 1976 . Venereal disease has reached epidemic proportions . I 'm convinced that if we do n't offer a first-rate program of sex education in all public schools no later than the fifth grade , we 're headed for trouble . On divorce , my position used to be that once you said " I do , " you kept the marriage together come hell or high water . I switched about 15 years ago after my readers describe in detail what hell was like , and ho frightening high water can be . Then also convinced me that keeping bad marriage together " for the sak of the children " was no favor to t children . Far better for a child to liv in a home with one parent who reasonably content @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marriage goes sour an there is no love , respect or loyalty left , I believe it is a mockery to try t hold it together with Elmer 's glue ; Or , when one party wants out , for whatever reason , I feel it is best to dissolve the marriage with as much dignity and grace as possible . From my own life I have learned that anything can happen to anybody . So expect the unexpected and , when it hits , hold your head up . Do n't look back . Forward march . You 'll be surprised at how much strength you have . Just remember that the good Lord never sends anyone more trouble than you and he can handle together . Eppie Lederer has learned a lot from Ann Landers. @#
