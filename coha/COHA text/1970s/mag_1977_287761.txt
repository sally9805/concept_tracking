" This puts transatlantic air travel in the pocket of the workingman , " proclaimed Freddie Laker , the scrappy founder of Britain 's Laker Airways , when in 1971 he first proposed Skytrain " shuttle " flights between New York and London at rock-bottom prices . Six years of governmental turbulence have held up the takeoff , but last week President Carter approved Laker 's plan . Since the British government assented in February , Laker 's three red , white and black DC-10s are now cleared to begin flying passengers Sept. 26 at the lowest fares ever quoted : $236 round trip , v. $631 for a 14-to 21-day summer excursion fare and up to $379 for a charter ticket on competing lines . <P> But talk about no frills ! There will be no reservations : seats will be sold at the airport on a first-come , first-served basis , beginning six hours before the departure of each flight ( one flight per day offseason , eleven weekly during the summer ) . A passenger who arrives after a flight is sold out will have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No free food will be served ; passengers will have to bring their own snacks or buy meals on board ( about $3 for a steak dinner ) . At the New York end , Laker 's planes will use Kennedy Airport-but in Britain they will operate out of Stansted Airport , 45 miles from London-and an inconvenient place to be stuck overnight . <P> Rival Shuttle . Laker is confident of making a profit ; to do so , he will have to fill an average two-thirds of the 345 seats on each flight during the summer rush . Pan Am and TWA , which hope to attract some of Laker 's customers , are sure to offer some rival shuttle of their own , or at least cut-rate stand-by seating on regularly scheduled flights . Some other transatlantic lines may do so too - but not Laker 's state-owned competitor , British Airways . British authorities do not plan to grant British Airways a Skytrain-type license . <P> The U.S. Civil Aeronautics Board has approved Laker 's Skytrain for a one-year experimental period only and can cancel the flights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carriers from starting competing bargain services . Whether that happens probably depends on what progress U.S. and British negotiators make in concluding a new agreement to regulate the number of flights and seats offered on the North Atlantic route . The Bermuda Agreement between the two countries expires midnight Tuesday . The British demand that in a new pact their lines receive half the revenues produced by flights between the U.S. and Britain , v. about 30% at present . The U.S. argues that nearly three-quarters of that traffic is generated on its shores and that the British are trying primarily to make up for British Airways ' heavy losses . The Bermuda Agreement could be extended while negotiations continue-but if it is not , U.S. and British lines would have to suspend all regularly scheduled flights between the two countries . At week 's end , U.S. carriers were making contingency plans to land London-bound passengers in Amsterdam or Paris . Even then , Laker Airways would not be grounded ; it could continue its busy charter service .            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
