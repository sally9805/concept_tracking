txt SHE DID N'T want to kill him , She could have . But she did n't want to . She only wanted to wound him . To hurt him in some way . Any way that would stop him . Stop him front this bloody attack on her husband . So she walked over to him , aimed the gun low , squeezed the trigger , and fired . And he stopped . Only a few minutes before it had been so happy and peaceful in the little family store . Until he walked in. 11E WAS WITH a second man and both were strangers . Young Maria Kushlda did n't even look up then . She was too busy cooing to her new baby . She 'd just dropped by her has . band 's jewelry store at 1053 W , Gran . ville Av. , to bring her husband , Stanley , 31 , a sandwich . She was just saying goodby when the men came in . They stood at the counter showing Stanley a watch and asking him how much it was worth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ son , " Stanley said proudly . " That 's nice , " one of the strangers said . WHEN MARIA and Stanley looked up from their baby 's smile , they were looking down the muzzles of two handguns . . " They did n't say anything , and they did n't have to , " says Maria , who , at 18 , is still pink  --  cheeked and wears dental braces . " We knew it was a holdup . Stanley 's lathes ' , who had the Jewelry store before us , had been held up so many times and shot at so many times that one side of his face was paralyzed for years from a robber 's bullet . We both knew what was going on , " The two men forced Stanley and Maria , her 2-month old boy , Brandon , // Close-up with Anne Keegan Bandit gets mercy but he gave none 1110 From page one // in her arms , to the back of the store . One man stayed in front , behind the counter . The other went back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few envelopes with some money ? the cash register money and our IRS money . It was n't that much , " Maria says . " The guy was kneeling down , going through our small safe , saying , ' Where 's the money , where 's the damn money ? ' " " That 's all there is , " Stanley said . " We 're poor . That 's all we have . " " There 's got to be more , " the armed robber said . And he kept rifling through the papers in the safe . He did not see a gun hidden there . Or the gun hidden in the big safe right next to it . BUT STANLEY had been eyeing the gun in the big safe . Thinking about it . Waiting for the right moment . And when he thought the time was right , he pulled the .22 magnum from the safe . And pointed it at the man with the gun . The man immediately went for Stanley . " He attacked Stanley and they sruggled t all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went down in a crash ? that 's when I heard a gun go off and Stanley was shot the first time , " Maria says . " Me and the other robber . We both stood their frozen . But only for a second . " At first I thought it was like television ? fake bullets ? they could n't be real . Then I saw the blood on the floor . It was Stanley 's blood . " MY HUSBAND was lying wounded . The gunman was shooting at him . My new baby was in my arms . My whole family was being threatened by these invaders with their guns . I knew I had to do something . And I 'd do anything for my husband and my baby . ' then Maria remembered there was another gu n . A .38 . It was hidden up in front , wider the counter , right next to the second gunman , " I ran up there and the second gun . man was stuffing his pockets with our Jewelry , " Maria says . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But inside I thought the end of my entire world was coming down . " OVER IN THE corner my husband was wounded and bleeding and trying to shoot back . The gunman was shooting at him and dodging his bullets . Ile was throwing chairs , boxes , tools  --  anything he could pick up ? at my husband . There was a raging gun battle going on . " I pulled out the .38 and aimed it at the man next to me . He started to run . I fired once and missed him as he ran out the door . Then I turned to Stanley . He was trying to protect himself but his gun was n't working anymore . No bullets were coming out . It was just clicking , empty . The guy was shooting at him and hitting him . " I knew I had to do something . I 'd never fired a gun before but somehow I knew what I was doing . " BOTH MEN were wounded and bleeding profusely but still battling when Maria slowly turned around . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her right hand was the .38 . " I shot once and missed , " Maria says . " But I knew the second time I would do it . The guy was on top of my husband now , trying to shoot him at close range , and I had to aim very carefully so I . would n't hit Stanley . " " I walked over close and did what had to do . I had to hurt this man . I knew that . But I did n't have to kill him . And I knew that , too . " So I took aim and I shot him right where I wanted to get him . In the thigh . He 's lucky . I did n't shoot to kill . I could have . But I 'm Catholic and something stopped me . So I did n't . " IT WAS Maria 's last shot that sloped the armed robber cold . The bullet she pumped into him caused him to finally give up . He tried for a moment to stand , his gun limp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , moaning . Maria , still composed , reached over to the phone and with one hand called the police . When they from they found her , the , only one from the gun battle still standing . In her right hand was a gun , still smoking . In the left , was a tiny baby , sound asleep . Hours later , after both men were operated on at Edgewater Hospital , Maria went to visit her husband . He had been shot three times and will be in the hospital for months . Then she went to visit the wounded gunman , who was hit four times . She was nervous when she walked in . But she was not afraid . " 1 WANTED to ask him If he thought I should have killed him . I wanted to know what he 'd say . I wanted to tell him I could have killed him but I did n't . I could have shot him through the head . But I wounded him on purpose . I wanted to tell him ? all this ? this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never did . I just asked him how he was . " I shot him because I had to save my family . I did n't kill him because that is not my human right . Why I feel that way I do not know . " Perhaps it 's because of my middle name . In Spanish , it is Mercedes . It means Mercy . And I guess that is what I showed this gunman . But It is more than he ever showed us. "
