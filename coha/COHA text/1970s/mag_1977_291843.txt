They have added a two-page preface , mostly of chatty , mildly condescending detail about their long relationship with the immensely profitable author . But , yes , buried in the middle of the third paragraph is the real reason for the note : she has chosen not to discuss the one episode in her 85 years that everyone will be looking for . There is nothing about her notorious lapse into amnesia in 1926 , and Dodd , Mead might well have tried to head off a great deal of fruitless inquiry .
