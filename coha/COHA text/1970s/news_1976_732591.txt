txt The New Jersey Supreme Court ruling last March that an ethics committee should judge the management of Karen Anne Quinlan 's care has created deep uncertainty about the role of such committees in American medicine and has raised many broad philosophical problems that challenge today 's society . The whole concept of an ethics committee to determine the fate of any patient is one that is being discussed with increasing frequency in medical and legal circles not just in the United States but also throughout the world . Such committees go by different names and sometimes are irreverently called " God Squads " and " God Committees . " They have been created to deal with such thorny issues as determining when a baby with severe birth defects should have elective surgery and what constitutes ordinary and ex // physicians on the panel , Dr. In addition to Mr. Berlin , the discussed and dealt with , now traordinary care for adults must be , " Dr. Oliver said .

Miss Quinlan , the 22-yearold coma victim whose case has attracted worldwide attention , is now a patient at the Morris View Nursing Home in Morris View , N. J. The sixmember ethics committee that was formed specifically because Miss Quinlan had been transferred there from St. Clare 's Hospital in Denville , N. J. , earlier this month , is believed to be the first at any ( nursing home in this country , according to interviews with Dr. Richard M. Watson , Miss Quinlan 's new physician , and Donald L. Berlin , counsel to the nursing home who is also a member of the ethics committee and is its official spokesman . A few teaching hospitals , such as the Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston , the University of Virginia in Charlottesville , Children 's Hospital of Pittsburgh and Johns Hopkins in Baltimore , have started ethics committees within the last five years . " The committees train doctors and other hospital workers in how to deal with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Mr. Curran , the Harvard lawyer , said .

" We had somewhat of an advantage over the normal case , in that there had been testimony which was summarized in the Supreme Court decision , " Mr. Berlin said . " So it was not like starting out afresh with little or no knowledge of the Quinlan case . In other cases where you start from scratch , we might want to hear more medical testimony and we might have added another doctor to the committee . " Members ' Now Realize ' Mr. Berlin said that the committee members , from their experience in the Quinlan case , " now realize the great responsibility that is on the physician and how difficult the decisions are that he makes . " That experience , Mr. Berlin said , led him to recommend the ' creation of ethics committees in all hospitals but not in other ' nursing homes , because such chronic-care facilities generally do not have to face ethical dilemmas similar to Miss Quin-1 Ian 's .

And while advocates expressed confidence in the value of such committees others said that committees had added an extra layer of bureaucracy and paperwork and seldom made clear decisions . In recommending that an ethics committee pass on Miss Quinlan 's care , the New Jersey Supreme Court cited a 1975 Baylor Law Review article on such panels by Dr. Karen Teel , an Austin , Tex. , pediatrician . But uncertainty about the role of ethics committees is expressed even by Dr. Teel , who said : " The idea was not original with me . After the article came out , I thought no one would see it again .

" It was perfectly clear that While many proponents adThe Ethics of Committees Dr. Watson , Miss Quinlan 's doctor , raised questions about the ethics of ethics committees . " An ethics committee is almost a contradiction in terms , " he said , " because the first thing you do is to spout the ugly details to a group of people who have no direct relationship to that patient . That 's not entirely ethical . It made me uneasy , but with Karen Anne Quinlan , everything I told the ethics committee already had been said all over the world .

" We were faced with a situation where we wanted this committee to meet as quickly as possible . As it turns out we could have taken more time .
