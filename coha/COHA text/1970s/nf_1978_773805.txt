txt The place of the Ten Gurus in the Sikh religion bringing a new emphasis to a concept which is as old as Sikhism . Guru Nanak had confronted Babur with his unjust imprisonment of Indian princes , and though he is usually depicted as a pacifist he certainly sanctioned resistance to evil . Both the Third and Fifth Gurus engaged in politics to the extent of siding with the over-burdened or unjustly treated tax payer against the Mughal rulers .. Guru Arjan clearly had some of the trappings of a temporal prince . The concept of piri and miri persisted in Sikhism in a manifest form until the death of the Tenth Guru and was revived to some extent by Maharaja Ranjit Singh in the nineteenth century . Sikhs today speak less of piri and rniri and more of tegh and deg , sword and cooking pot , by which is meant the protection of the oppressed and the feeding of the hungry . These terms , popularised by the Ninth and Tenth Gurus , epitomise the householder concept of Sikhism in terms of social responsibility . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the giving of alms ! It is a way of protecting the defenceless and , though Sikhs have a military reputation , warfare should be a last resort only to be undertaken in the cause of justice . The Ninth Guru , Tegh Bahadur , youngest son of Guru Hargobind , gave his life for such a cause . Outwardly Guru Hargobind seems to have been concerned more with miri than with piri , so much so that it is said that Goswami Ram Das , guru of the famous Indian nationalist Sivaji , put the following question to him : I hear that you are the successor of Guru Nanak . Guru Nanak had renounced the world while you wear the sword , keep horses and an army and people call you Sacha I'adshah . What kind of a sadhu are you ? ' The Guru replied , Saintliness is within . Sovereignty is external . ' ( ' Batan fagiri , zahir amiri . ' ) There is little wonder that his contemporary Bhai Gurdas felt moved to mention such criticisms in one of his Vars . He voices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sit in the dharmsala , The present Guru does not stay in any one place . Emperors called at the residence of former Gurus , The present Guru was imprisoned by an Emperor . Formerly the disciples could not find room in the ever-crowded congregations , The present Guru leads a roving life fearing no one . 30 The place of the Ten Gurus in the Sikh religion Former Gurus gave consolation sitting on a manji , The present Guru keeps dogs and hunts . The former Gurus would compose hymns , listen to them and would sing ; The present Guru does not compose , listen or sing . His companions are not Sikhs , He has wicked and bad people as his guides . ( Var z6 ) Bidi Chand , one of his famous companions , was certainly a reformed bandit and in the Guru 's later years , during the struggle against Shah Jehan , he was a leader of men of very mixed motives . His own were summed up in the concept of miri and piri , for in his own mind his warfare was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opponent of Shah Jehan 's destruction of Hindu and Sikh places of worship and his policy of forcibly dissolving the marriages of Hindus to Muslim women . In his later years Guru Hargobind established a refuge at Kiratpur in the Shivalik hills in the territory of Raja Tarachand who had renounced his allegiance to Shah Jehan . Earlier , until the death of Jehangir and except for a brief period of imprisonment , the Guru had been Jehangir 's friend and hunting companion and must have given the impression of being a prince rather than a sadhu . Nevertheless , from his own closeness to the Guru Bhai Gurdas could speak of the devotion of his followers , which extended beyond Sikhs and his consciousness of responsibility . Bhai Gurdas continues : Yet the truth can not be concealed , The Sikhs are enamoured of his lotus feet like bees . He supports an intolerable burden But he does not complain of it . ( Var 26 , pauri 24 ) Besides developing the concept of mid and piri the Sixth Guru 's contributions to Sikhism were threefold . He restored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had fallen into neglect ; he provided a pennant for his troops which became the flag of Sikhism known as the nishan sahib ; and his troops used the kettledrum , which explains the surprising injunction in the Rehat Maryada or regulations governing the Sikh faith that there should be a kettledrum in each gurdwara ( see Appendix I ) . 3 a The place of the Ten Gurus in the Sikh religion Guru Har Rai ( born 3o January z 63o , Guru 1644-61 ) Guru Hargobind 's last years were saddened by the deaths of all his sons except Tegh Bahadur , the youngest , a man who had fought bravely at the skirmish of Kartarpur in 1638 but whose withdrawn nature did not commend him as a candidate for the position of Guru . Har Rai , the younger son of Guru Hargobind 's eldest son , was therefore chosen . That he was only fourteen might cause some surprise , but Akbar became Emperor at thirteen . The Indian way of life accelerates maturity with respect to responsibility and outlook , and the Guru like any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known about any council which assisted any of the Gurus . In Sikh tradition he is mainly remembered for three things . First , though he continued to hunt in the manner of his grandfather , he trapped animals and kept them in his gardens in preference to killing them . Second , he grew herbs and was interested in medicine so that it is reported that when Prince Dara the son of Shah Jehan was ill the remedy was supplied from plants grown by the Guru . These two episodes suggest a reversion to the type of guruship which existed before the reign of Guru Arjan . Though tender-hearted is an epithet often used of the Seventh Guru , his resolution is shown by the third anecdote . With the imminent death of Shah Jehan , war broke out between his sons . Guru Har Rai supported Dara with an army of 2,000 men but the prince was indecisive and victory went to his brother Aurang- - zeb . The Guru was summoned to the Mughal court but he sent Ram Rai , his son , instead . At the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nanak 's found in the Granth Sahib , The dust of a Muslim is kneaded by a potter into clay and he converts it into pots and bricks which cry out as they burn ' ( AG 466 ) . The original context is a discussion of cremation and inhumation in which the Guru expresses the view that the choice is unimportant . The Muslim remains may find themselves part of the potter 's clay , so , in a sense , the one who practises burial may be accidentally cremated in the kiln ! Ram Rai answered that a scribal error had been responsible for the use of the word Musulman ' , it should have been beiman ' , faithless . Guru Har Rai 's comment on hearing of his son 's failure to stand by the words of Guru Nanak and the text of the 32 The place of the Ten Gurus in the Sikh religion Granth Sahib were : The Guruship is like a tiger 's milk which can only be contained in a golden cup . Only he who is ready to devote his life thereto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on my face again . ' Harsh words to speak about the failure of a fourteen-year-old , but the episode conveys the importance which the scripture now possessed in the Sikh community . Guru Har Krishan ( born 7 July i 6 ; 6 , Guru 1661-4 ) Ram Rai remained at the Mughal court and was used as a rival to the Gurus , both Har Rai and especially his five-year-old son who succeeded him . The little boy was taken to Delhi to live in the city residence of Raja Jai Singh so that the Emperor could decide on a suitable leader for the Sikhs . There , on a site now occupied by the gurdwara Bangla Sahib , he contracted small pox and died , but not before he had nominated a successor , Baba Bakale ' , his great-uncle who lived in Bakala . Guru Tegh Bahadur ( born z April 1621 , Guru 1664-71 ) The man who became Ninth Guru was one who had twice been passed over in earlier years . Although his courage in battles against Mughal forces had earned him the name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ birth name Tyag Mal , he was clearly not the person to continue Guru Hargobind 's political development of guruship . Guru Har Rai 's reason for nominating a five-year-old boy in preference to his uncle is less easy to discern until one remembers the tradition that twenty-two members of the Sodhi family appeared at Bakala each claiming to be the person designated by Guru Har Krishan . Presumably to choose a son was a way of averting the dynastic problems which would arise from nominating some other relative , and the establishment of guruship in the Sodhi family was so firm by now that no choice which went outside it could be contemplated . Once installed Guru Tegh Bahadur proved to be the man to meet the demands of the time . He possessed inner qualities which alone were capable of countering a period of harassment . Something of his approach to life may be seen from his selfgiven nickname Degh Bahadur , brave cooking pot , which he preferred to brave sword . It was as feeder of the hungry that he 33 The place of the Ten Gurus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there were few occasions when he could live peacefully as he wished . Within the sangat there was faction . Not only was Ram Rai being used by the Mughals as a rival , perhaps willingly by now , but his other kinsmen still maintained their opposition . When he visited Amritsar the massands slammed the doors of the Harmandir in his face . Dhirmal , his nephew , plotted his assassination but the bullet only grazed his shoulder . The marksman was pardoned . As the Guru said , It is a great act to exercise forgiveness . To forgive is to give alms . It is equal to bathing at all places of pilgrimage . Forgiveness ensures man 's liberation . There is no virtue equal to forgiveness . ' As the reign of Aurangzeb proceeded ( effective ruler 16 58 ? i 707 , though Shah Jehan lived to 1666 ) the process of Islamisation developed . In 1669 he ordered the closing of Hindu schools and the demolition of temples . Sometimes , as in Agra , this work was carried out and mosques were erected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as opposition grew . Forcible conversions to Islam , the reimposition of pilgrim taxes and , four years after the Ninth Guru 's death , the introduction of the jizya , a tax imposed on non-Muslims , provoked civil war . Sikhs and Hindus alike suffered , the rivals for the Guru 's position vanished with the hard times leaving Guru Tegh Bahadur to rally the community . This he did by travelling about north-west India until he was summoned to Aurangzeb 's court . Imprisonment followed . After four of his cotnpanions had been executed in his presence he like them refused to become a Muslim ; instead he accepted death . His martyrdom is seen not only as the act of a man dying resolutely for his own faith but on behalf of Hinduism and religious liberty as , a principle . The view is well summed up in some verses composed by his son Gcbind Rai whom he had nominated as his successor . To preserve their right to wear their caste marks and their sacred threads , Did he , in the dark age , perform the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the utmost limit , He gave his head but never cried in pain . He suffered martyrdom for the sake of his faith . He lost his head but did not reveal his secret . 34 The place of the Ten Gurus in the Sikh religion He disclaimed to perform miracles or jugglers ' tricks For such fill men of God with shame . He burst the bonds of mortal clay And went to the abode of God . No one hath ever performed an act as noble as his . ( Vichitar Natak ) Guru Gobind Singh ( born 22 December 1666 , Guru 1671-17 08 ) The last Guru was a person who , in Sikh eyes , combined the qualities of his most illustrious predecessors . He is the perfect example of manhood , highly educated , skilled in horsemanship and the use of arms , chivalrous and generous in character . Whereas in his father 's lifetime passive resistance alone was possible , before Guru Gobind Rai was very old armed revolts were breaking out in much of Aurangzeb 's Empire . From an historical point of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terms of what actually happened the end was tragedy and chaos . For the Sikh , the significance of his Guruship is of greatest importance . As the last and greatest Guru after Nanak , the subsequent development of Sikhism is telescoped in his reign and his achievements . For example , the decision of Ahmad Shah Abdali of Afghanistan who invaded India nine times between 1747 and 1769 to present his campaigns as a jihad ( holy war ) reflected itself in historical writing , and the earlier struggles of the Tenth Guru were seen as the defence of Sikhism or Hinduism against the Muslim assault of Aurangzeb . It is easy to forget that a possible meeting between the Guru and Aurangzeb was being arranged when the Emperor died and that the Guru 's forces were campaigning with those of the new ruler Bahadur Shah at the time of the Guru 's assassination irr 1708 . The two major religious acts of the Guru 's reign have also been telescoped by tradition . This should not be allowed to diminish their religious importance within the community . Rather it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Guru ordered his Sikhs to assemble before him as was customary at this festival , but he issued his command with a greater urgency than usual . He reminded them of the perilous time in which they were living and spoke of a plan to replace their weakness by strength and unity . It would demand supreme loyalty to the 35 The place of the Ten Gurus in the Sikh religion Guru . He then asked for men to come forward who would give their heads to him . He made the request in a spectacular manner with drawn sword . No one responded for some time , save with a hushed and fearful silence . At last one Sikh came forward and was led into the Guru 's tent . The Guru reappeared alone , with a bloodstained sword . Four more men followed , though in the time it took the volunteers to come forward many other Sikhs departed from Anandpur . After the last of the panj pyares ( beloved five ) , as they are now called , had entered the tent the Guru emerged with them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life , others that the blood was that of a goat , but all agree on their fearless devotion to the Guru and his ideals . The five were given nectar ( amrit ) made from water and sugar crystals gpatashas ) prepared in an iron bowl and stirred with a two-edged sword , and then the Guru himself received the same initiation followed by many thousands from all castes and Untouchables . Finally the Guru proclaimed a Code of Discipline : Tobacco , the eating of meat from animals slaughtered according to the Muslim ritual ( hallal ) , and sexual intercourse with Muslim women were to be avoided . The members of the new brotherhood , which was called the Khalsa ( Pure Ones ) , were to have no dealings with those who followed rival leaders or their successors and were also instructed to wear five symbols ? uncut hair , a comb , a steel wrist guard , a sword , and short breeches . Initiated men took the name Singh ' ( lion ) and henceforth the Tenth Guru was known asGobind Singh . Two other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were admitted to the Khalsa , taking the name Kaur ' ( princess ) . Second , of the panj pyares one came from the Kshatriya caste and another from the Jat and the rest from the Sudra group , symbolising the ideals of caste and sex equality . A consequence of the Guru 's action certainly seems to have been to place the strength of eighteenth- and nineteenthcentury Sikhism in the third , fourth and fifth orders of Indian society , though some of its leaders still came from the Kshatriya varna . Sometimes pictures of the first amrit ceremony show two dead hawks on their backs on the ground while two doves , their killers , sit proudly on the bowl of nectar . By drinking from it the doves had gained the strength of hawks . Self-respect and cohesion through loyalty to the Guru was the purpose of the formation of 36 The place of the Ten Gurus in the Sikh religion the Khalsa but before his death the Guru took another step . On 7 October 1708 , knowing that he would not recover from a knife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have taken five coins and a coconut which he placed before a copy of the Granth Sahib , thus installing it as Guru . He had once said , Where there are five there am I , When the five meet , they are the holiest of the holy . ' Now the new concept of Guru became not only that of the message contained in the Book but that of the Guru Panth , the spirit of the Guru present wherever members of the Khalsa deliberated and made decisions in the presence of the Guru Granth Sahib . Guru Gobind Singh 's mission was above all religious . He saw himself as a restorer of dharma in the finest Indian tradition , by which he meant true religion , and played with the language of avatar to the point that some scholars have concluded that he saw himself as one . In fact he accepted the role but reinterpreted the concept of stressing his own humanity . None the less he was a man of destiny in his own eyes : The divine Guru sent me for righteousness ' sake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Extend the faith everywhere and to Seize and desiroy the evil and the sinful . Understand this , ye holy men , in your souls . I assumed birth for the purpose Of spreading the faith , saving the saints And extirpating all tyrants . His identity with the Khalsa was to the point of asserting that There is no difference between the Guru and the sangat . The sangat and the True Guru are one and the same . His respect for the Khalsa is nowhere better seen than in one of his poems : All the battles I have won against tyranny I have fought with the devoted backing of the people ; Through them only have I been able to bestow gifts , Through their help I have escaped from harm ; 37 The place of the Ten Gurus in the Sikh religion The love and generosity of these Sikhs Have enriched my heart and home . Through their grace I have attained all learning ; Through their help in battle I have slain all my enemies . I was born to serve them , through them I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind and ready help ? There are millions of insignificant people like me . ' True service is the service of these people . I am not inclined to serve others of higher caste : Charity will bear fruit in this and the next world , If given to such worthy people as these ; All other sacrifices and charities are profitless . From toe to toe , whatever I call my own , All I possess and carry , I dedicate to these people . The Guru frequently used epic poetry as a means of rallying his followers . His court , even , more than that of Guru Arjan , was a centre of bardic activity , but when he revised the Granth Sahib to include the hymns of his father he inserted none of his own , with the possible exception of one verse . His own poetry , he told those who wanted him to include it in the Granth Sahib , was mere play . It was left for a follower Bhai Mani Singh to collect it together early in the eighteenth century in the Dasam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the eyes of western scholars In the present chapter the Sikh view of the contribution of the Ten Gurus has been expressed . Only Guru Nanak has attracted the serious attention of western writers , who have usually cornbined a study of his work with an appraisal of Sikhism . Earlier in this book ( p. 6 ) , it was asserted that Guru Nanak is most satisfactorily understood if he is placed within the sant tradition . This interpretation of his location in the Indian religious firmament has not always been accepted . Some scholars have described Sikhism as syncretistic ( Noss , 1963 ; Parrinder , 1961 ; De Bary , 1958 ) . Sen ( 1970 ) , Renou ( 1953 ) , Smart ( 1972 ) and Sharpe ( Hinnells and Sharpe , 1972 ) did not necessarily reject the sant tradition but explicitly described Guru Nanak as a disciple of Kabir . An earlier exponent of this view was J. N. Farquhar in his Primer of Hinduism ( 1912 ) , a book which has had a 38 The place of the Ten Gurus in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ religions of India . Guru Nanak 's purpose has often been explained in words reminiscent of those of John Malcolm , who wrote his Sketch of the Sikhs in 1812 : Born in a province on the extreme verge of India , at the very point where the religion of Muhammed and the idolatrous worship of Hindus appeared to touch , at the moment when both tribes cherished the most violent rancour of animosity towards each other , his great aim was to blend those jarring elements in peaceful union , and he only endeavoured to effect this purpose through the means of mild persuasion . His wish was to recall both Muhammedans and Hindus to an exclusive attention to that sublirnest of all principles , which inculcates devotion to God , and peace towards man . He had to combat the furious bigotry of the one and the deep-rooted superstition of the other ; but he attempted to overcome all obstacles by the force of reason and humanity ( quoted Punjab Past and Present vol. 3 , 1969 , p. 113 ) . Hew McLeod ( McLeod , 1968 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ zo ) examines the eclectic , eirenic view in some detail and concludes that in the life and teaching of Guru Nanak , The intention to reconcile was certainly there , but not by the path of syncretism . Conventional Hindu belief and Islam were not regarded as fundamentally right but as fundamentally wrong ' ( 1968 , p. 161 ) . The picture of Guru Nanak as a bridge-builder between the two militant antagonists of Islam and Brahminical Hinduism receives some support from a reading of the Sikh biographies of the Guru known as janam sakhis . It is also an interpretation which Sikhs in our present ecumenical age are often happy to present . Sometimes the view is accompanied by a misleading quotation of the words There is neither Hindu nor Mussulman ' . However , the Guru went on to add , so whose path shall I follow ? I shall follow God 's path . God is neither Hindu nor Mussulman and the path which I shall follow is God 's . ' The early janam sakhis belong to the time of the Fifth and Sixth Gurus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the unifying faith of the Mughal Empire ' . An inclination to show the Guru 's universal appeal may be discerned in some of the episodes , 39 The place of the Ten Gurus in the Sikh religion but behind this interpretation many if not most of the individual narratives portray the superiority of Sikhism at the expense of the other faiths with which the Guru came in contact . From his hymns contained in the Adi Granth come such quotations as The vedas and the semitic texts ( lit . Kitab ) know not the Lord 's mystery . ( AG 1oz1 ) In Vedas and Puranas I see not another . ( AG 1022 ) The Muslims praise the shariat . They read and reflect upon it . Lord 's servants are they who fall into captivity trying to perceive him . The Hindus praise the praiseworthy one whose vision and beauty are incomparable , but they bathe at pilgrimage places , make flower offerings and place the perfume of sandal wood before idols . ( AG 465 ) Text upon text may be put forward in discussing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The following three , each to do with ritual , suggest to the present writers that he did not regard them as fundamentally wrong ' but as potentially distracting . They were likely to become ends in themselves rather than the means whereby ultimate truth might be realised . In the passages cited the emphasis is not on salvation through the sacred texts but only by commitment . If they happen to know the nature of God , they will realise that all rites and beliefs are futile . ( AG 470 ) Rituals and ceremonies are chains of the mind . ( AG 635 ) Cursed be the ritual that makes us forget the Loved One . ( AG S90 ) When the Guru said , Let compassion be your mosque , faith your prayer carpet and righteousness your Qur'an . Let modesty be your circumcision and uprightness your fasting . Thus you will become a true Muslim . ( AG 140 ) we contend he was not denouncing Islam as futile but was seeking to recall it to the truth of its revelation in the classical 40 The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manner . In doing so he was , like similar figures before and since , expressing something of his own personal dissatisfaction , holding faiths and practices up to the scrutiny of his own insights . Kabir stood in a similar position to Guru Nanak with regard to the religious systems of his day . As his elder , probably dying in 1518 , it has been usual to postulate a relationship between the two sant-poets in which Kabir is described as Nanak 's guru , especially as many of Kabir 's hymns are included in the Sikh scriptures . In two of the janam sakhis , meetings between the Guru and Kabir are describ , ? d . In one ( Meharban ) Kabir bows before the Guru and describes him as jagat-guru or enlightener of the world . The Handaliya account is associated with a breakaway sect which left the Sikhs during the time of the Third Guru ; its statement that Guru Nanak was the disciple of Kabir may be regarded as part of the attempt to deprecate the importance of Sikhism 's founder figure . The Handaliya @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1907 ) and through this medium the tradition gained ground in Europe . A kinship of thought between Guru Nanak and Kabir can not be denied and some if not all of the hymns of Kabir in the Adi Granth would seem to have been collected by Guru Nanak . However , it is likely that he also gathered hymns of Namdev and Baba Farid and that the link with Kabir lies in the common sant tradition and not in a direct personal connection . A detailed comparison of the teachings of Kabir and Guru Nanak would reveal no similarities which could not have arisen from the common sant tradition as well as a few differences . Most notably the Guru does not share Kabir 's preference for the name Ram ' . Guru Nanak was a strict monotheist and this seems to be the main doctrinal reason for claiming that he was influenced by Islam . However , as with Kabir there is remarkably little Sufi influence in his writings and apart from the terms which he could have picked up from his daily life in a Muslim environment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was Buddhism as Islam . As has been pointed out above , monotheism was as much part of the sant tradition as it is fundamental to Islam and there is no need to look beyond the sants . Though Sufism may have been responsible for their insistence on the oneness of God their denial of duality must be seen as belonging to the Indian 41 The place of the Ten Gurus in the Sikh religion rather than Arabian tradition . It was Islam in the political form of the Mughal Empire more than the Sufis which influenced Sikhism , and this in outward form rather than doctrine . In this respect the militant Sikh brotherhood , the Khalsa , instituted in 1699 is only a step in a process lasting ninety years , during which the Sikhs had been transforming themselves from a purely religious fellowship ( or panth ) to an independent , largely Punjabi , Indian freedom movement . This process seemed to have reached its culmination when Maharaja Ranjit Singh ruled over an independent Punjab , but this was not a Sikh state , and despite the ruler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a state in which religion could be expressed freely but was not accompanied by privilege . At what point militant Sikhism came to have the aim of winning independence from the Mughals it is difficult to say . It first expressed itself in Banda Singh 's warcry of 1710 , Raj Karega Khalsa ' , The Khalsa will rule ! ' When Aurangzeb died Guru Gobind Singh was on his way to the court at Agra for an audience , he was received by his successor Bahadur Shah , presented with a jewelled scarf and other gifts and remained at the court for four months . His army marched with the Emperor 's though it does not seem to have taken part in any campaigns . In 1968 McLeod 's study of Guru Nanak was published . It was this which placed Guru Nanak within the sant tradition of north India . However , much of the book is concerned with the quest of the historical Guru Nanak . The janam sakhis were subjected to rigorous scrutiny as historical sources and McLeod concluded that for the most part they did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sikhs have often reacted by defending the janam sakhi traditions ( especially Trilochan Singh , 1969 ) . Students who can not read Punjabi must stand frustrated on the sidelines until either they have mastered the language or the janam sakhis have been rendered into satisfactory English translations . Contemporary Indian scholars often see Guru Nanak as a reformer anticipating the work of Mahatma Gandhi . See the volumes of essays published to celebrate the quincentenary of Guru Nanak 's birth listed on p. 199 and annual anniversary tributes in the Spokesman or Sikh Review . // The Sikh scriptures One of the most fascinating aspects of Sikhism is the process which began with a human Guru , continued during a period of duality in which there were human Gurus and a collection of sacred writings , and ended with the present situation in which full authority is enjoyed by the scripture . The development can be appreciated visually by looking at one of the many pictures of Guru Nanak with his companions Bala and Mardana . He is to be seen sitting on a cushion or low stool , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shading him with its branches . Bala usually stands at his side with a peacock feather fan in his hand or a chauri of yak hairs embedded in a wooden or silver holder . The tree is intentionally reminiscent of the chattri ( umbrella or parasol ) which Lakshman holds over Rama in similar Hindu devotional pictures or which is to be found above the dome of a Buddhist temple . Compare such a portrait of Guru Nanak with enthroned scriptures in any Sikh temple and the similarity will immediately be seen , in fact their position is not similar but identical . In every respect the scripture is what the Gurus were . The Ten Gurus were not worshipped , neither is the Book even though the worshipper will bow or prostrate fully before it on entering the gurdwara . However , some gurdwaras will install it in the morning and put it to bed at night in much the same way as Rama and Krishna are cared for in Hindu temples . 43 The Sikh scriptures It is not unusual to come across denunciation of such practices in Sikh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respect which they are accorded because of the bani which they express , the word of divine truth . Therefore it was possible for Guru Arjan , the fifth in the human line , to bow before the collection which he had compiled and installed in the newly-built Darbar Sahib in 1604 , for he was acknowledging the higher authority of the bani to that personal importance and significance which he possessed as Guru . This is discussed further in the section on the nature and role of the Guru ( p. i oo ) . The emphasis upon the bani is so complete that the position of the human Guru in Sikhism might seem , to the casual observer , to be one in which complete reverence has given way to complete indifference . A Sikh should not bow to a picture of a Guru as a Hindu would offer puja to a picture of Rama . Pictures of the Gurus should not be displayed near the scripture . In the 193os paintings of the Gurus were discouraged in gurdwaras but in more recent times this stricture seems to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up in a single pithy comment , The picture of the Guru is the gurbani ' ( Bhai Gurdas , Var 24 , pauri II ) . The bani did not begin with Guru Nanak and in a sense it has not ended with the compilation of a scripture for Sikhs believe that where the congregation of believers gathers to hear the bani , God himself is present interpreting it to the needs of their situation . From it both the individual and the community can obtain consolation , joy and encouragement . It is therefore the focal point of all important events . The naming of a child is at its direction , a wedding performed by walking round it four times is regarded as valid in Sikh tradition regardless of civil requirements , and it is often read when a family moves into a new house or a firm into new business premises . Chapter 6 describes the Book 's importance in domestic life . Two names are usually given to the Sikh scriptures , the Adi Granth and the Guru Granth Sahib . The first title is earlier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Lord ) , frequently used of Krishna , only occurs after 1708 when the Tenth Guru installed the scripture as his successor . Granth ' simply means collection , anthology or book and the word Adi ' means first ' . 44 The Sikh scriptures It is customary to explain the title Adi Granth as distinguishing the scriptures from the collection of the Tenth Guru 's writings known as the Dasam Granth . However , adi ' often means first in sense of importance and not only time and the name should be seen as referring to the unique scriptural status which the anthology possesses . Perhaps the point can be reinforced by noting that Guru Nanak is pehle Guru ' ( First Guru ) , the Adi Guru is God . The origin of the Guru Granth Sahib lies in the hymns of Guru Nanak . Mardana features in many janam sakhi accounts as the Guru 's companion and the one who accompanied the Guru by playing a stringed instrument called a rebeck . When the Guru sensed the imminence of an inspired utterance he would warn Mardana to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was looking after a horse the Guru broke the silence of meditation and exclaimed , Mardana , touch the chords , the Word is descending . ' But master , ' his friend replied , my hands are occupied in holding the reins of this grazing horse . If I let go it may run away . " Let the horse go , ' insisted Guru Nanak . Such a consciousness of inspiration must have led to the memorising or writing down of the Guru 's compositions during his lifetime . Tradition is uncertain here . Sometimes Guru Angad is named as the first person to assemble the Guru 's hymns but it seems more likely that when he was invested as Guru the most important object which he received was a bani pothi , an anthology of at least some of the Guru 's hymns . Two other narratives indicate the existence of some kind of collection during the Guru 's lifetime . The Puratan Janam Sakhi states that a disciple Mansukh spent three years at Kartarpur with the Guru preparing a pothi under his supervision . More intriguing is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mecca he carried a staff in his hand , a book under his arm , a water pot and a prayer carpet for the call to prayer ' ( Var I , pauri 32 ) . Perhaps this book contained the bani of Farid , Namdev and Kabir and other pre-Nanak sants whose hymns are found in the Adi Granth . It is impossible to be sure and conclusions have often been reached which are based on theories of the Guru 's dependence upon Kabir . It has already been pointed out that the common sant tradition may account for the many similarities which exist between the teachings of Kabir and those of Guru 45 The Sikh scriptures Nanak . There is no trustworthy evidence that the two men ever met but it would be surprising if the Guru had never heard of such a famous person whose beliefs were in such agreement with his own . If he did know of him he could be expected to collect his writings and those of other teachers of similar views . Nothing could be more natural . The Mohan Pothi compiled on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have survived and whose contents are , therefore , known in detail . The two-volume pothi of 600 and 448 pages respectively includes works by Guru Nanak then Guru Angad and Guru Amar Das himself , followed by hymns of Kabir , Namdev , Trilochan , Sein , Ravidas and finally Jaidev . Here is clear evidence that non-Sikh material ( called the bhagat bani by Sikhs ) had a place in Sikh writings before the time of Guru Arjan . The initiative to include it may have come from Guru Amar Das but this is unlikely when the reasons for compiling the pothi are examined . A significant absentee is Baba Farid . It is tempting to speculate that his compositions were included by Guru Arjan as part of his attempt to commend Sikhism as the faith which could cement the Mughal Empire during the favourable reign of Akbar the Great . However , it would be wrong to place too much weight on the Mohan Pothi . The 600- and 448-page volumes do not even contain all the compositions of Guru Nanak . The group of hymns known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cite only one important example . The Farid bani may have been in one of the other sources used by Guru Arjan . There is definite evidence that the first Guru knew at least some of the Sufi 's poetry . One of his sabads occurs bn page 794 of the Adi Granth . You could not make a raft at the time when you should have made it . When the sea is full and overflowing it is hard to cross . Do not touch the saffron flower with your hand , its colour will fade , my dear . First the bride herself is weak and in addition her husband 's command is hard to bear . As the milk does not return to her breast so the soul does not enter the same body again . Says Farid , 0 my friends , when the spouse calls , the soul departs crestfallen and this body becomes a heap of ashes . 46 The Sikh scriptures On page 729 is this verse of Guru Nanak 's : Make meditation on the Lord and self control the raft by which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as comfortable as if there were no ocean or overflowing stream . Your name alone is the unfading madder with which my cloak is dyed . My beloved Lord , this colour is everlasting . The dear friends have departed , how shall they meet the Lord . If they are united in virtue the Lord will join them with himself . Once united the mortal does not separate again if the union is true . The true Lord puts an end to birth and rebirth . She who removes self-centredness sews herself a garment to please her husband . By the Guru 's instruction she obtained the fruit of the nectar of the Lord 's word . Says Nanak , 0 my friends my spouse is very dear to me . We are the Lord 's hand maidens . He is our true husband . There are a number of obvious similarities of thought and the Guru can be seen to be replacing Farid 's warnings against impermanence with positive commendations . In the original Gurmukhi there is a considerable identity of language . The Mohan Pothi of Guru Amar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Sikh movement was expanding and the derpanu for copies of the hymns ( pothis ) of the First and Second Gurus was growing steadily . Second , the religion was now moving into its second generation , its leader was not someone who had been one of Guru Nanak 's disciples . Men like Bhai Paira , who had copied pothis for the Second Guru , and Bhai Buddha were ageing . Soon their personal witness to the authenticity of the bani might be lost . Third , disgruntled sectarian groups were already beginning to assemble spurious collections of hymns attributed to Guru Nanak either for the purpose of promoting their own claims to be the true Sikhs or to bring the Guru into disrepute . The bani of Guru Amar Das contains a number of warnings against apostasy and false teachings : All other teaching but that of the Sat Guru is false . False are those who utter it , false are those who hear it , false those who recite it and those who invent it . They utter the Lord 's name with their tongue but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) 47 The Sikh scriptures It seems unlikely that a Guru who was himself under attack would have introduced non-Sikh material into the bani . Guru Angad was no innovator and therefore the conclusion would seem to be that Guru Nanak was responsible . The pothi was compiled by Guru Amar Das 's grandson Sahansar Ram but the two volumes had passed into the hands of his father Baba Mohan by the time Guru Arjan decided to compile the Adi Granth , hence its name Mohan Pothi . The Adi Granth of Guru Arjan was much more than yet another compilation . It was intended to be definitive and the Guru succeeded in this aim . As a result of considerable personal effort he gathered the best available manuscripts , even , it is said , going to the extent of singing Mohan 's praises outside his window to obtain the loan of his collection of hymns . Mohan , the son of Amar Das , according to the same tradition , was disappointed when his father chose Ram Das to be Fourth Guru . Therefore , he was not inclined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Das 's son . The song associated with the tale is to be found on page 248 of the Adi Granth . It does refer to Mohan but the context leaves no doubt that God is being addressed as the attractive one ' ( Mohan ) . The story 's value lies in indicating Guru Arjan 's concern to assemble the best available anthologies . He also borrowed a pothi in the possession of Datu , Guru Angad 's son , but its contents are not known . In addition to these he had the help of Bhai Buddha , a surviving member of the Kartarpur community and therefore a valuable link with the living voice of Guru Nanak . However , while fidelity to the bani and comprehensiveness were major concerns , Guru Arjan was not afraid to allow his own genius to express itself . IIe included his own compositions , almost equal in number to those contained in the pothis , but he also removed some verses of the bhagats , and simplified the language of others , for example the bani of Namdev . One sabad previously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 125 2 ) . Guru Arjan gave the Granth its distinctive form . The Book 's arrangement is his , so is its final syntax , the poetry being accented in such a way as to make alteration difficult without going against its rhythm and musical setting . Mohan 's pothi had fourteen divisions , the Adi Granth has thirty-one . These were made according to Indian musical measures , called 48 The Sikh scriptures rags . Generally speaking rags are composed to suit various moods . Some are appropriate to morning , others to evening , some to joy , others to grief . Guru Arjan indicated that faith should produce a balanced outlook , tempering both happiness and sadness so , for example , between pages 917 and 924 are found both the Anand , Guru Amar Das 's hymn of joy , and Sunder 's dirge on that Guru 's death . The setting is Ramkali rag , which relates to the season of Besant in March shortly before harvest . The mood is one of yearning . The rag was often favoured by yogis . Another example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parties , and laments put on adjacent pages under Rag Wadhans ( AG S75-81 ) . It is difficult to over-estimate Guru Arjan 's achievement . Scrutinising the hymns of the earlier Gurus and the Hindu and Muslim poets had been the least of his difficulties . The quantity of their writings scarcely equalled his . To arrange the whole in an orderly manner and in such a way that the philosophy of the balanced life , including Sikhism , as the achieved ideal for which other faiths had been vainly striving was more difficult . No translation has yet managed to communicate the flavour of his success . Perhaps none ever will because of the sheer bulk of the material . It may be that a good translation of one of the major rags will serve to illustrate the point one day . So far no selection of passages from the Adi Granth has concentrated upon the complete examination of one particular rag . The text of Guru Arjan 's Adi Granth was considered to be the authorised version of the scripture . Two anecdotes illustrate the importance which was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( see p. 32 ) , and resulted in the name Ram Rai standing for apostasy among the Sikhs . The other incident occurred in the time of Guru Arjan himself . A disciple , Bhai Banno , made a copy of the Granth Sahib but when he came to the one line of the Bhagat Surdas which is to be found on page 125 3 he added the rest of the verse . He also included a stanza by the woman poet Mira Bai at the end of Rag Maru . This Guru Arjan had deleted in the original manuscript by crossing it out . Bhai Banno 's alterations may appear unimportant , but they were sufficient for the Guru to condemn the copy as bitter ' in comparison with the sweet ' authentic version . To the Granth Sahib of Guru Arjan the Tenth Guru merely 49 The Sikh scriptures added the hymns of his own father , Guru Tegh Bahadur . Also , before his death , he installed the scriptures as Guru thus completing a process which had been developing for well over a century . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given pride of place in the worship of the community , being already regarded as divinely inspired . At Amritsar the Fifth Guru housed the Adi Granth in the newly built Darbar Sahib and bowed before it . The recognition which the Tenth Guru gave the scripture made de jure what was in a sense already de facto . The distinction between the human Guru and the gurbani now became complete with his decision to appoint no human successor . Close textual study of the Adi Granth is something which Sikh scholars have yet to undertake . The material for it exists . The Mohan Pothi survives , Guru Arjan 's original manuscript is at Kartarpur in Jullundur district . The copy which Guru Gobind Singh used when he conferred guruship upon the scripture in 1708 was destroyed but copies made by Baba Deep Singh and Bhai Mani Singh survive . For that matter so does the Bhai Bhanno version and , at Dera Dun , the one used by Ram Rai . However , the analytical approach to scriptural texts which has concerned western scholars for the best part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Asian scholars whose concern is for the message of the scripture . It could be that the next decade will see the publication of photocopies of the important texts mentioned above but if it does the enthusiasm for the venture will be greater among non-Sikhs than Sikhs , who will probably concentrate their efforts on presenting an understanding of the message of Sikhism to the western world . The copies of the Guru Granth Sahib which may be found in any Gurdwara from California to Bangkok are identical . Each has 1430 pages . This standardisation of page length and numbering took place in the nineteenth century . The script used is called Gurmukhi and is used irrespective of whether the original hymn was composed in medieval Hindi , Punjabi or some other language . Apart from the Japji of Guru Nanak , Sodar , Sopurkh and the bedtime prayer Sohilla which follow it , plus seventy-eight pages at the end of the Adi Granth , the rest of the book is divided into thirty-one sections . The singing of the bani is called kirtan . It is intended to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ congregation can participate and to prevent concentration upon the words becoming secondary to enjoying a musical feast . Usually in a gurdwara the musicians ( ragis ) will be three in number , one playing the portable harmonium ( a result of eighteenth- or nineteenth-century European influence ) , another playing the drum , either the single instrument with parchment at both ends or two drums fastened together and with parchment at one end only . The third musician sings and explains the bani , and may play an instrument as well . A pair of steel tongs with rows of brass discs fixed along their length and the sarinda with its three strings which are played with a bow may be used as well as other stringed instruments , including the violin , an instrument which is not uncommon in southern India . Traditions in the singing of the gurbani change from time to time . The harmonium eventually found its way into the gurdwara despite resistance from the ragis of the Golden Temple . They have often been the mainstay of traditions and maintainers of standards , such men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1926 aged 123 years . Most of his seventy years as a ragi playing the sarinda and singing the bani had been spent in the Golden Temple . Now it seems that the Indian cinema may be influencing some younger musicians . The structure of the Guru Granth Sahib is explained in Appendix 4 . In this present section it is only necessary to note a few points . First , there is a major structure to the scripture . Pages 14 to 13 52 are divided into thirty-one parts each named after the musical setting to which it should be sung . The compositions before page 14 , the important hymns which Sikhs use in daily meditation , are given distinction by being excluded from the dominant form of arrangement . The last 78 pages contain hymns which are often so short that they could not be placed in the main body of the text satisfactorily . Second , within the major structure there is a clear substructure . Each section begins with the writings of Guru Nanak followed by those of the Third , Fourth , Fifth and Ninth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beginning with those of Kabir . As the table in Appendix 4 indicates , not every author , even Guru Nanak , is represented in each section . Guru Angad 's verses were few ( sixty-two ) and brief and have been attached to the hymns of other Gurus . 51 The Sikh scriptures Finally , the Adi Granth is unique among the world 's scriptures in its inclusion of non-Sikh hymns . Hindu and Muslim writings are included in what is called the bhagat bani . Only speculative conclusions can be drawn to explain the inclusion of particular poets in the bhagat bani . It has already been suggested that some owed their place to Guru Nanak . The token presence of the bhagats seems to indicate Guru Arjan 's desire to present Sikhism as the catholic faith . The inclusion of a hymn by a particular sant was not important in itself but for the acknowledgment which it made that he also proclaimed the sabd and for the claim that the right place for his devotees to be was within the fold of Sikhism . Whatever the language in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Guru Granth have been recorded in the same script , that of the Punjabi language , called Gurmukhi . It is this name , not Punjabi , which should properly be used for written Punjabi , whether the reference is to a daily paper , a novel or the Adi Granth . Persian , Punjabi and Hindi are not written alike . The use of a uniform script by Guru Arjan despite the variety of languages and dialects may have been another way of asserting catholicity . Revelation in the Guru Granth Sahib When a Sikh describes the Adi Granth as the word of God he is making a statement which is both exclusive and inclusive . It is exclusive in the sense that it is the sacred book of his religion , it is the scripture which is to be found in the gurdwara and which forms the basis of his meditation , understanding of God and world-outlook . At the same time he would not confine the phrase word of God ' to the Adi Granth . Not only would he wish to include the revealed scriptures of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room for the words of living men and women , now and in the future , to be regarded as revelation . Godly people , having been enlightened by God , possess divine knowledge intuitively through meditation . God resides in the soul and the soul is contained in him ' ( AG 115 3 ) . The bani is the verbal expression of this . Revelation in the Adi Granth has as its heritage the rich concept of sabd in Indian thought , plus the belief that revelation is the expression of the experience of the 52 The Sikh scriptures truth which is God , in verbal form . The bani is God . Guru Amar Das said , The gurbani is God himself and it is through it that man obtained union with God ' ( AG 39 ) . Guru Ram Das expressed the same thought in slightly different words , The gurbani is the Lord 's name and this name I enshrine in my mind ' ( AG 1239 ) . The compiler of the Adi Granth , Guru Arjan , said , The holy book is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Vedas are not condemned by the Sikh Gurus though the formalism arising from them is : There are six Hindu schools of thought , each has its own guru and its own doctrine but the guru of all gurus is one , however many his manifestations . . . . As there is one sun and many seasons so there is one God though he has many forms . ( AG 3 57 ) The principle of revelation is nowhere better demonstrated than by the inclusion of the Bhagat bani , as the non-Sikh material is called , in the Adi Granth . It comprises about one-sixth of the total ( 938 sabads out of a total of 5894 ) , thus exceeding the contribution of any one Guru other than Guru Arjan . Of course the danger of false teachers exists . Accepting the view that God may speak through anyone leaves one open to the blandishments of any self-styled holy man , especially in the Indian village . The Sikh is advised to keep the fellowship of the sangat ; in their company he will learn discretion . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the body of doctrine given by the Gurus . Subject-matter and content The form of the Guru Granth Sahib is poetry . Its major concern might be described as soteriological , though in the specific Sikh sense of enabling the reader , or originally the hearer , to realise the essential unity with God . There are no mythological narratives , though God is described in anthropomorphic terms and the Gurus are not afraid to use the imagery of family relationships to describe the union of God and man : A young wife sits at home . Her beloved is away . She continually thinks of him and pines for him . If her intentions are good their reunion shall not be delayed ' ( AG 594 ) . The nearest the Guru Granth Sahib comes to narrative 53 The Sikh scriptures is the discourse between Guru Nanak and the yogis , Siddha Gosht . For the Sikh right living is the key to a proper relationship with God . Consequently the poems are full of references to individual conduct . The most important themes are covered in the later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Adi Granth in a passage called Mandavani or the Seal , Guru Arjan explains the scripture in these words , comparing it to a dish of food : In the platter are placed three things , truth , contentment and meditation . The nectar-name of the Lord , the support of all , has also been put therein . If someone eats this food , if someone relishes it , he is emancipated . This can not be forsaken so keep it enshrined in your mind always . Falling down at the Lord 's feet the dark world ocean is crossed . 0 Nanak , everything is an extension of the Lord . ( AG 1429 ) 7 ' he place of the Guru Granth Sahib in worship The scripture is more than a visible focal point for Sikh devotions , though to sit for a time in a gurdwara , view its centrality and watch men and women bowing reverently in front of it is probably the best position from which to begin to understand its significance . The Guru Granth Sahib so dominates Sikh ritual and Sikh theology that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reader is referred to other sections , especially those on the gurdwara , Sikh daily life , ceremonies , festivals , and the index . Here we shall confine ourselves to noting how the Guru Granth has taken the place of the living Gurus . In 1920 an incident occurred which demonstrates the way in which the Adi Granth holds the position of Guru in another respect . The custom of consulting the scripture is common . At the end of a service the Adi Granth will be opened at random and a portion read . Many Sikhs do this daily , regarding the verses as word from God which they will find helpful during the day . This is called vak lao , taking advice . The 192os was a period when large groups of Punjabi outcastes were becoming Sikhs or Christians in the hope of improving social status . Whilst cornmensality is practised by Sikhs , the question of allowing Untouchable converts to offer karah parshad presented a new issue 54 The Sikh scriptures as hitherto most Sikhs had been of a higher status . Members of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to offer karah parshad but organisations are as often influenced by traditions which have accrued as by the doctrine and in the nineteenth century Sikhism had often been introspective . In 1920 a large number of outcastes were initiated into the Khalsa and went to the Golden Temple to offer karah parshad . Traditionalists wished to refuse it ; the reformers pressed the principle that karah parshad should be given by all Khalsa members . It was agreed that advice should be taken from the Guru and therefore a copy was opened at random . The passage which was turned up read : Upon the worthless he bestows his grace , brother , if they will serve the True Guru . Exalted is the service of the True Guru , brother , to hold in remembrance the divine name . God himself offers grace and mystic union . We are worthless sinners brother , yet the True Guru has drawn us to that blissful union . ( AG 638:3 ) The words of Guru Amar Das clinched the issue . Clearly the Guru had accepted the converts . The sangat followed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Untouchables. 7 he Dasam Granth Guru Gobind Singh was a prolific poet and seems to have been equally at home in Persian , Sanskrit or Punjabi . He included none of his writings in the Adi Granth and at the time of his death they were scattered in various parts of India . The Guru himself does not seem to have attempted to compile them into an anthology and certainly he would not have approved any suggestion that they might rival the Adi Granth . The corpus of Guru Gobind Singh 's writings which bears the title Dasam Granth is the product of the devoted labours of Bhai Mani Singh and was not completed until twenty-six years after the Guru 's death in 1734 . It includes a number of compositions written by poets who were in the service of his court . The Gurmukhi script is used throughout the book irrespective of whether the language be Sanskrit , Persian , Hindi or Punjabi . The form of verse and the type of poetry is as variable as the language . 55 The Sikh scriptures There are more than z , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The first is the Jap , a meditative hymn reminiscent of the Japji of Guru Nanak . It begins , God has no marks or symbols , He is of no colour , of no caste , He is not even of any lineage . His form , hue , shape and garb Can not be described by anyone . He is immovable , self-existent ; He shines in his own splendour ; No one can measure his might . He is the king of kings , the lordly Indra , Of countless Indras ; the supreme Ruler Of the three worlds of gods , men and demons , Even the meadows and the woodlands Cry in his praise , Infinite , Infinite ! O Lord who can tell the number of your names ? I will try to relate your names According to your deeds . In the second hymn , entitled Akal Ustat , the Praise of the Lord , there are verses which indicate that the early spirit of Sikhism still lived , which stated that behind the diversities of religion lay the oneness of God : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holy monk . Another sets up as a Yogi Or as some other kind of ascetic . Some call themselves Hindus , Others call themselves Muslims . Among these are Shiahs and also Sunnis , Yet man is one race in all the world . God as Creator and God as Good , God in his Bounty and God in his Mercy Is all one God . Even in our errors We should not separate God from God ! Worship the one God , The one divine Guru for all men . All men have the same form , All men have the same soul . ii 56 The Sikh scriptures Some of the poems are very different . Vichitar Natak , the Wonderful Drama , outlines the Guru 's family history , reforming mission and warlike exploits . The Zafarnama is a letter in Persian written to the Emperor Aurangzeb . In it the charge of deliberately provoking war is rejected but a doctrine of the just war is laid down : When all efforts to restore peace prove useless and no words avail , Lawful is the flash of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Together with the thirty-three verses in praise of the Immortal One ( Swayyas ) the poems already mentioned probably constitute the best known and most important of the Guru 's works . The Jap , some stanzas from the Akal Ustat and the thirty-three Swayyas are all used liturgically in the initiation ceremonies or other acts of worship and are to be found in the gutkas , small anthologies of hymns which many Sikhs possess and use for daily meditation . In the Guru 's own time other poems probably had a very strong appeal and significance but they fall into the class of occasional literature written to meet the needs of the day which once past makes their appeal diminish with time . Of such is Pakhian Charitra , a compendium of medieval legends and romances reinterpreted for use as the means of communicating homespun wisdom and ethical teaching , though a few passages from this 579-page section of over 400 stories are used in the amrit initiation ceremony . With Chaubis Avtar , based on the incarnation of Shiva , and Chandi Charitra , the exploits of Chandi , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a method which the Guru used to express Sikh ideas through the Hindu and local Punjabi culture . Instead of rejecting folk tales and myths out of hand he reinterpreted them hoping to wean those who had been brought up in them from the old traditions to the ideals of Sikhism . Sometimes in doing so he also explained mythological and historical references which are to be found in the Adi Granth . However , the unity of the Dasam Granth is only one of authorship and of the Gurmukhi script . Its language , purpose and form are diverse and it must not be regarded as anything more than an anthology . // The Gurdwara and Sikh worship Wherever there are Sikhs there will be a gurdwara . It may be a magnificent white ornate building rising high above the trees and houses of a Punjabi village , or it may be a plain flat-roofed building remarkable only for its size compared with the other houses nearby . In the UK it may be a terrace house or a former Christian church . Strictly speaking a gurdwara is any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ installed . The unique and distinguishing feature will always be the nishan sahib , a flagstaff with the yellow flag of Sikhism flying from it . This serves as a statement of the Sikh presence . It enables the traveller , whether he be Sikh or not , to know where hospitality is available . It is an assertion of authority , the principle of freedom of worship . For these reasons one will often see Sikhs bowing towards the nishan sahib , touching its base before they enter the building . Gurdwaras fall into two groups , with the Golden Temple at Amritsar ( the Darbar Sahib or 1-larmandir ) distinct from either of them . First , there is the community gurdwara built by Sikhs to meet their religious and social needs . Then , better known , are the historic gurdwaras . These are buildings erected on sites which are important in the history of Sikhism . For example the Sis Ganj in Delhi marks the place where Guru Tegh Bahadur was martyred and the Keshgarh at Anandpur was erected over 58 The Gurdwara and Sikh worship the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practice seems to have begun with Guru Hargobind , to whom the first use of the word gurdwara is attributed . He visited places associated with his father or his predecessors , especially Guru Nanak , restored the buildings which he found , encouraging proper teaching and preaching to be given in them . The name used for these structures was dharmsala , which can signify a rest-house for travellers in its normal Indian context but was used in the early days of Sikhism to denote a room or building used for devotional singing ( kirtan ) and prayers . Guru Nanak built a dharmsala at Kartarpur and Bhai Gurdas claims , possibly with some poetic licence , that , Centres of worship were established wherever Baba Nanak set foot . All the Siddh centres i.e. religious centres in the world became centres of Nanak 's teaching . Every house became a dharmsala and kirtan was sung as if it were an unending Baisakhi festival . ( Vat i , pauri 27 ) It might well have been an early Sikh strategy to provide alternative meeting places to those of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Boo Janam Sakhi God addresses the following words to Guru Nanak , As the Vaishnavas have their temples , the yogis their asan , and the Muslims their mosque , so your followers shall have their dharmsala . ' So many passages in the janam sakhis end with the statement a dharmsala was built ' that it seems to have been a provision introduced by the First Guru . Frequently the building was a gift from a devotee . The Hafizabad Janam Sakhi attributes the first dharmsala to a thag ( a term which may denote a worshipper of Kali who practised ritual murder , or may merely mean a highway robber ) named Sajjan who built it after his conversion . Another anecdote tells of a rich official who decided to drive Guru Nanak from the district . He mounted his horse but on the way it fell and he was unseated . As he returned home the people said that he had committed a dreadful sin and would have to go to the Guru for pardon . Next day he set out again but was overcome by blindness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person . You must go to him on foot with palms joined in humble submission , ' 59 The Gurdwara and Sikh worship they urged , and say " May my sins be forgiven " . ' He penitently made his way to the Guru , fell at his feet and was forgiven . Then he respectfully asked the Guru to accept a gift . At first Guru Nanak refused but eventually accepted a large area of land . On this a dharmsala was built . The remaining ground was cultivated and the income used to maintain the building and a common kitchen . It was buildings of such origins that Guru Hargobind restored . Some may have fallen into disuse as Sikhs moved from the district or reverted to the major Hindu tradition in the third or fourth generation . In the early seventeenth century the historical consciousness of the Sikhs grew and the work of the Sixth Guru matches the spirit of the age . The historic gurdwaras which are to be found in India and Pakistan today stand on the sites of those earlier times but are for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not only with the peace of the British period but with the Singh Sabha movement which emerged as a response to Christian and Hindu missionary activity . The architecture of the major gurdwaras is normally in the Mughal style of Shah Jehan which Sikhs find a congenial blend of Muslim and Hindu forms , though they have developed it in a peculiarly Sikh manner . Whatever the brick or stone used the finish is usually white . The chattris or kiosks which surmount the minarets of the Taj Mahal or the Lahore Gate of the Red Fort at Delhi are not only to be found at the four corners , as they are for example at the Diwan-i-Khaz of the Red Fort , but may be seen at many points along the parapet of a gurdwara . Sometimes the slender lantern-like kiosks of Aurangzeb 's Pearl Mosque , also found in the Red Fort , have been incorporated . The other important characteristics are the oriel or bow windows and the domes . The windows have shallow elliptical cornices supported by brackets and the arches are frequently enriched by means of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ palaces of Udaipur . The domes of the gurdwaras may have a floral cap and spike ( kalas ) in common with the great mosques and Hindu temples of the last Mughal period , but they are distinctively fluted . Whereas the dome of a Hindu temple stands like a mountain over the sanctuary , the dome of a gurdwara is placed with architectural considerations alone in mind . If it is directly above the Guru Granth Sahib this is merely coincidental . 6o The Gurdwara and Sikh worship The Golden Temple at Amritsar , whilst distinctively Sikh , can not be regarded as a typical gurdwara . Set in the centre of a rectangular artificial pool it is much more a house for the Guru Granth Sahib , where kirtan are sung all day and to which pilgrims come from z a.m. until late at night , than a place of congregational worship . Indeed both langar and diwan are held elsewhere than in the Golden Temple itself . However , the Harmandir does emphatically bring together the many facets of Sikh architecture including the inlay of semi-precious stones such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well as mirror-work inlay in some of the interior decoration , especially in the Shish Mahal or mirror room and the roof of the building . There are also murals depicting scenes from the life of Guru Nanak . Another feature of the interior is the inscription of verses from the Guru Granth Sahib in gilded lettering on some of the walls . A visitor to the Golden Temple may be reminded of Delhi 's Red Fort , the lake palaces of Udaipur and the Taj Mahal but the Harmandir is ultimately more than the sum of these parts . The function of the gurdwara is not unlike that of the dharmsala from which it evolved . From the Boo Janam Sakhi comes this account which provides some insight into early Sikh worship : Below the raja 's palace was the dharmsala where the Sikhs sang hymns and performed kirtan . Sitting there the raja would fix his attention on the music of whatever hymn the Sikhs were singing . One day the rani said to the raja , Raja , how is it no children have been born in our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our petition before the congregation , for the Guru is present in the congregation . ' An excellent idea ! ' replied the raja . Next day the raja and the rani both joined the congregation . A large congregation was present . A hymn was being sung and all were sitting enthralled . The raja and the rani then presented their petition saying , You are the assembly of the Guru and whatever is sought from you is granted . May it please you to hear our intercession so that the Guru may grant a son . ' Those who were present in the congregation offered a prayer that the raja 's faith might remain unshaken . Then they assured him , The Guru Baba will grant you a son . ' 6i The Gurdwara and Sikh worship This description of a seventeenth-century act of worship not only shows the importance of kirtan , but it also emphasises the Guru Panth , the congregation met in the Guru 's name . It is a tenet of the Sikh faith that where the company of believers ( sangat ) is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ devotees constantly sing your praises . You are the refuge in which they find deliverance , 0 Creator Lord . You unite them with yourself .... Without the True Guru there is no congregation and without the Name no one is ferried across the world ocean . He who utters the Lord 's praise day and night merges his light with the supreme light . ( AG ro68 ; 3rd Guru ) Therefore when a Sikh enters a gurdwara he believes he is entering the presence of the Guru . Gurdwara ' means the home or abode of the Guru ; wherever the Guru Granth Sahib is installed there is a gurdwara . Entering a large gurdwara one will often encounter a complexity of rooms , for the building may also serve as a school where children are taught the rudiments of Sikhism , as well as a rest , centre for travellers . Often there will be a kitchen where food can be prepared , though the langar itself might take place under an awning in the open air . Sometimes the gurdwara will also be used as a clinic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worship and the main room will be that in which the Guru Granth Sahib is installed and where the community gathers for diwan . The focal point in this room will be the Book itself , placed upon cushions and underneath a canopy . Sometimes both cushions and canopy will be set inside a wooden frame called a takht ( throne ) or palki ( akin to the word palanquin ) . Popular religious pictures sometimes show Guru Nanak sitting on his gaddi under a tree as those of Hinduism show Rama enthroned with Lakshman holding an umbrella ( chattri ) over him whilst Hanuman or Sita hold a wand or fan of peacock feathers . In the gurdwara the Guru Granth Sahib on its manji ( bed ) is the enthroned Guru , the canopy is the chattri denoting authority and the attendant waving the chauri ( yak hairs embedded in a wooden or metal handle ) is the devotee showing respect for authority . The room may otherwise be bare and even devoid of seats . The walls may be decorated with murals or Gurmukhi verses from 6z The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only requirement is the congregation and the Guru Granth Sahib . Without the Sikh community there would be no gurdwara in any real sense . The gurdwaras of Pakistan or Uganda are mere shrines as no Sikh communities remain to worship in them . On the other hand without a place where the gurbani may be heard and sung the Sikh sangat is incomplete . Worship in the gurdwara Worship may take place at any time and no quorum is required . It is customary for Sikhs to assemble for congregational worship early in the morning or , more especially , in the evening . This is in the tradition of Guru Nanak 's community at Kartarpur but is also a recognition of the realities of the householder life . During the day most members of the community will be practising their faith at work . There is no fixed day for worship and even if some Sikhs living in the Punjab gather in greater numbers at Sangrand , the first day of the lunar calendar , this is only because in rural communities it is the moon cycle which plays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . India 's festivals like those of Islam or the dates of the Passover , Easter and Pentecost/Whitsuntide are for the most part determined by the moon . A Sangrand service may therefore include the Bara Mahan ( Twelve Months ) hymn of Guru Arjan with an explanation of its symbolic meaning , relating it to the stages of human life and the journey of the soul . Before going to the gurdwara , whether it be in the morning or the evening , the Sikh will have bathed . In the morning he will also have recited some or all of the Japji . At the gurdwara he may bow and touch the flagstaff before climbing the steps into the gurdwara . As he mounts the steps he is likely to bend , touch the step with his hand and put his hand to his forehead : Whereever my Sat Guru goes and sits , that place is beautiful , 0 Lord King . The Guru 's disciples seek that place and take and apply its dust to their foreheads ' ( AG S40 ; 4th Guru ) . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or there may be a place to put them inside the building . Along village paths and roads it is common to walk barefoot , and a pump or channel of running water will be available at the gurdwara where those who 63 The Gurdwara and Sikh worship need to can wash their feet . The head is always covered and if a Sikh woman has been walking along the road with an uncovered head she will draw her scarf over it before entering the building . Inside the gurdwara the Sikh will approach the dais upon which the Guru Granth Sahib rests , bow or prostrate fully and make an offering of money or food to be used in the kitchen . Careful not to turn the back on the Book the worshipper will then sit with the congregation on a bare floor or one which has been covered with a mat or carpet . ( Chairs are not forbidden but in the subcontinent they are not found even in all Christian churches , despite the European influence . In the Punjab there are no gurdwaras with benches or chairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a matter of convention , of custom not belief , similar to the practice in some Hindu temples or European churches . Worship need not begin with a litany or ceremony , but merely with the opening of the Book by any man or woman who can read it . Usually Sukhmani will be sung in the morning and often the time of evening worship is announced to the village by the granthi sounding a gong . At this service Rahiras will be the principal hymn . Music , the singing of kirtan to the accompaniment of the drum and harmonium as well as other instruments , is an important part of worship . The Gurus encouraged music at their courts . Guru Arjan declared music to be an adornment of the tongue ' and the third Guru said : The music and those songs are welcome hrough which the mind is concentrated on him God with ease . ( AG 849 ) The singing of the Gurus ' hymns ( kirtan ) , exegesis , exhortation , mainly through stories of the Gurus and their most famous disciples , constitute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not fixed . Some gurdwaras in Indian cities or in the west may now begin their service at set times and schedule them to last for ninety minutes or two hours . Such matters are decided by a committee . Sikhism has no priesthood , or ordained ministry . No human being may take the place of the Gurus or rival the Guru Granth Sahib . In some gurdwaras a man called a granthi may be paid a salary ( sewn ) to read the scriptures , conduct 64 The Gurdwara and Sikh worship services and perform such ceremonies as marriages , but his role is purely functional . The appointment is not necessarily permanent . He is the servant of the community and his position has never become such that he might be compared to a priest or minister as normally understood . Towards the conclusion of worship a liturgy emerges . The seated congregation will sing the Anand Sahib ( the hymn of bliss of Guru Amar Das ) . In this the devotee rejoices that he has found the Sat Guru and is sustained by meditation on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joy , my fortunate friends ; all my desires have been fulfilled . I have reached God , the Supreme Spirit , and all my sorrows have vanished . My sorrows , afflictions and sufferings have departed by hearing the true Word . The saints and holy men are glad on hearing it from the perfect Guru . Pure are they who hear it ; stainless are those who utter it , and the True Guru will fill their hearts . Nanak proclaims ; for those who bow at the Guru 's feet , heavenly trumpets will sound . ( AG 917 ) The epilogue to the Japji Sahib of Guru Nanak will be read , which is a reminder of the liberating as well as awesome presence of God : Air , water and earth , of these are we made . Air like the Guru 's word gives breath to life . To the babe born to the great mother sired of the waters . The day and the night our nurses be That watch us in our infancy ; In their laps we play , the world is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come to judgment at your court . Some shall be seated near your seat , some shall always be kept distant . The toils of those who have worshipped you have ended , O Nanak , their faces are lit with joyful radiance , Many others are set free . ( AG 8 ) The sangat then stands to hear the verse Too Thakur turn pah ardas ' composed by Guru Arjan : 65 The Gurdwara and Sikh worship Thou art the Master , to thee I pray . My body and soul are thy gifts to start life with . Thou art the Father , Thou art the Mother , and we Thy children ! We drew manifold blessings from Thy grace . None knows thine extent : Thou art the highest of the high , All creation is strung on thy will : It has to accept all that comes from thee . Thou alone knowest what informs Thy purposes . I am ever and ever a sacrifice unto Thee . ( AG z68 ) Then with hands clasped in front of the chest and head slightly bowed each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number , it may be man or woman , who is a Khalsa Sikh , offers the prayer which is known by no other name than Ardas . ( This important passage is printed as Appendix z and discussed fully at that point . ) Everyone sings the final portion of Ardas after which the Guru Granth Sahib is opened at random and a brief verse of guidance ( vak ) read to the sangat . Diwan ends with a distribution of karah parshad . This sweet food is made of flour , sugar and clarified butter which has been cooked , and is served warm to everyone who is present . It symbolises universal brotherhood . // Sikh religious thought Introduction Sikh theology possesses a coherence unique in the sant tradition . This brief outline is intended to convey something of this and so make the more detailed study which follows clearer by bringing out the inter-relatedness and interdependence of most of the beliefs . It has already been asserted that Sikhism grew out of the sant tradition and a general north-west Indian environment of religious variety in a basically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this section to examine the origins of the Sikh concepts unless it is considered necessary for the purpose of understanding them . We shall concentrate on describing and explaining them . Sikhism is strictly monotheistic . So firmly is the oneness of God affirmed that it is arguably monistic . Ultimate reality is a unity , God is one without a second . Parmeshur ( God ) is essen-tially without qualities ( nirguna ) . Consequently sat ( truth ) or akal ( beyond time ) or other negative terms such as ajuni ( not becom-ing ) are among the least inadequate descriptions . However , Parmeshur or Sat is also personal , manifest and possesses qualities ( saguna ) , though his attributes are never physical , even though anthropomorphisms are used in the Adi Granth 's poetry . In his manifest form his qualities , Sabd ( word ) , Nam ( personality or 67 Sikh religious thought character ) and Guru ( enlightener ) are communicative and creative . God is the creator , the universe emanates from him , its existence and its continuing survival depend upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Man is unique in this creation since he alone possesses the ability to discriminate and enter into a voluntary relationship of love with God . In his natural state man sees himself as creation 's Lord disregarding the evidence of his own finiteness which mortality and nature 's independence of him provide . He is characterised by self-reliance ( haumai ) and at best sees the world including himself erroneously as distinct from God . This duality leads to attachment to temporal values which is maya . The consequence is rebirth ( san.sara ) on the basis of previous actions ( karma ) . There is only one way of achieving liberation ( mukti ) ? this is by conquering haumai , ceasing to be worldly-minded ( man mukh ) and become God-conscious and God-filled ( gurmukh ) . This can only be done by becoming aware of the inner presence of God as Sabd , Guru and Nam and by coming completely under their influence . This in turn is only possible because God looks benignly ( prasad , nadar ) upon man 's efforts and as Sabd , Guru @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believer . Because God is within , rituals ore unnecessary but right conduct is essential . The mark of the gurmukh is his life of service ( sewa ) in the world as a householder ( grihastha ) , not a sannyasin ( renouncer ) , because now in his state of jivan mukti ( liberation whilst still in this corporeal existence ) he perceives himself and the world as part of the one reality to which he is now consciously attached and in which , at death , he will be completely merged . This brief outline , introducing the most important Sikh terms , is developed and explained in the sections which follow . The concept of God God is the one , the only one ' , the one without a second ' . These are the recurrent observations of the six Gurus whose hymns are contained in the Adi Granth and of Guru Gobind Singh . As a result there has been some discussion among scholars whether Sikhism is to be described as monistic or monotheistic . It is certainly monistic in the sense that the types @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an ultimate unity of such a kind that the world derives from God and will be reabsorbed in him . When the Creator projected himself all creatures of the earth assumed various shapes . But when you draw creation within yourself , O Lord , all embodied beings are absorbed in you . ( Guru Gobind Singh ) It is certainly true to say that Guru Nanak believed in a personal God who could be worshipped and loved . This understanding of God was derived from experience . When he was taken to God 's court , as he put it , he became aware of God as one , as personal and as pervading the universe . He was given a cup of the nectar of God 's name to drink and was commanded to go into the world to preach the divine name , but from then on he not only found him within himself , he perceived God as pervading all forms , all castes and all hearts ' ( AG 223 ) . The Mool Mantra , which is said to have been the Guru 's first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a summary of the beliefs . It reads : There is one God , Eternal truth is his name , Creator of all things and the all-pervading spirit . Fearless and without hatred , Timeless and formless . Beyond birth and death , Self-enlightened . By the grace of the Guru he is known . The symbol representing ' Ik oankar ' , there is one God , is found on the canopy above the Adi Granth in the gurdwara . It is an immediate reminder of the symbol Om ' which may be seen in a similar position in Hindu temples , though here the canopy is placed over pictures or statues of the deities . The coincidence is intentional , Ik oankar ( ) like Om ( ) stands for the one primal reality . Of Om the Katha Unpanishad states , That which the Vedas declare , that which all austerities utter , that in desire of which men become students , that word I tell you briefly is Om . 69 Sikh religious thought That word is even Brahman , the Supreme ' ( 2.15 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lord oankar created Brahma , The one Lord fashioned the human mind , From the one Lord came mountains and ages . The one Lord created the Vedas . ( AG 929 ) This Lord may be experienced but he can not be known by the mind , he is beyond comprehension . The Guru can only lament his inadequacy confronted with the ultimate reality of the all-pervading Lord ; O mother , the attributes of God can not be comprehended , and without actually seeing him one can not say anything about him . How is he to be described , 0 mother ? ' ( AG 1256 ) . Strictly speaking God is pure being , without qualities ( nirguna ) and therefore Guru Nanak describes him as Sat ( truth ) , Eternal truth is his name . ' Only your functional names have I been able to describe . Your oldest name is Eternal Reality ' ( AG 1o83 ) . Sat ' is itself a functional name significant for theology , personal belief and ethics , for life must be based on trust in God ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ names given to God although these are found in the Adi Granth . Ram , Mohan ( beautiful ) , Gobind ( World Lord ) , Hari , even Allah or Khuda ( Creator ) , taken from Hinduism and Islam , occur in the scrip-tures . For example , He is Allah , Alakh , Agam , Kadur , Karan-har , Karim ' ( AG 64 ) . Manmohan Singh 's translation reads , He is the unseen , inscrutable , inaccessible , omnipotent and bounteous creator ' , which hides the point that Guru Nanak was using Muslim names of God in such a way as to imply that all were . acceptable but to be interpreted only as attributes of the One who is beyond names . However , each evokes some preconception , each can provide a stopping place which is short of ultimate , therefore the abstract term Sat ' is preferred by Guru Nanak though occasionally God is addressed as Anami ' ( without a name ) . Because functional names can be applied to him , e.g. Sat Nam ( name ) and Sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that God s saguna with attributes as well as nirguna , but Sikhism rejects he view that God ever assumes any physical form either animal or human . The rest of the Mool Mantra is concerned with the functions of 70 Sikh religious thought deity . First , God is creator , immanent in the universe . There ar no creation stories , only the expression of a belief that the uni verse is an emanation of God produced because he willed it existence . The situation before time was as follows : For millions of years there was nothing but darkness over the void . There was neither earth nor sky , only the Infinite Will . There was neither night nor day , sun nor moon and the Lord was in a state of trance samadhi . The sources of creation did not exist , there was no speech , no air , no water , no birth , no death , no coming or going , no regions , no seven seas , no worlds above or below . The trimurti of Brahma , Vishnu and Shiva did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Absolute Lord . ( AG 1035 ) For reasons known only to himself , God decided to bring the universe into being . It was experience not metaphysics which concerned the Guru : The Infinite Lord has enshrined his might within all . He himself is detached and without limit or equal . He created nature and inanimate nature came from the existing void . From his own Being sunte came air , water and the world , bodies and his spirit with them . Your light , 0 Lord , is within fire , water and living beings and in your Absolute Self lies the power of creation . From the Absolute Lord emanated Brahma , Vishnu and Shiva : from him came all the ages ... . All that springs from the Lord merges with him again . By his play the Lord has created nature and by his word has manifested the wonder . From himself he has made day and night . From him came creation and destruction , pleasure and pain . The godly-minded remain stable and detached from the effect of good or ill and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Sikhism has no difficulty in coming to terms with scientific theories of evolution , in fact they find them congenial to the belief in an expanding universe derived from the mind of God . 71 Sikh religious thought Their opposition is not to evolution but to a materialism which regards the universe as self-explanatory and self-existent . Those who hold such views are the victims of deception : The world without the True One is merely a dream ' ( AG 1274 ) ; they will waken to disillusionment , for God who is eternal , wise and omniscient is the master of destiny . The world , on the other hand , is fickle and inconstant ' ( AG 1109 ) . The world is even described as his pastime ( lila ) , but not in such a way that he is to be seen as fickle . Belief in God as Truth sees him as moral and the basis for morality , in the sense that it depends upon him for existence : Seated in the creation God looks on what he intended to be his pastime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is also described as fearless and without hatred . Man lives in constant dread of hunger , sickness or death ; in Hindu mythology the gods are often afraid and frequently engage in vindictive wars , plots and deceitful tricks as they struggle for power . In the view of Guru Nanak a man should possess only awe in God 's presence , not fear : To be possessed by any fear but God 's is vain ; all other fears are but phantoms of the mind ' ( AG 151 ) . The Sikh should find his anxieties banished as he experiences union with God . The Guru 's servants are pleasing to the Lord . He forgives them and they no longer fear death 's courier . The Lord dispels the doubt of those who love him , and he unites them with himself . The Lord is free from fear , limitless and infinite . He , the creator , is pleased with truth . ( AG 1190 ) The terms timeless , formless , beyond birth and death ' must be considered together and one of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given a chapter to itself , such is its importance . These words are to be understood by reference to their popular Hindu context . In the life of village India and its festivals Krishna , one of the principal deities , was born at Vrindavan , and his birthday is celebrated in late July or early August . In some myths the gods and goddesses die . It must be acknowledged that in the story of the Bhagavad Gita a much different view of incarnation is presented . It was not the profundities of this concept which the Guru had in mind , but the much more earthy anthropomorphic stories which led to what he regarded as futile superstition . An anthology of such stories is easily available in Hindu Myths , 72 Sikh religious thought ( O'Flaherty , 1975 ) . God is personal but not anthropomorphic , he does not grow old and is unwearied either by effort or suppli-cation . Time is his servant not his master ; changes are caused by him , God is not affected by them . Sometimes one Hindu god is enlightened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ superiority , but in the teachings of Guru Nanak God is self-enlightened . Finally , we come to that phrase of the Mool Mantra which states that God is known to man by the Guru 's grace . The concept of grace will be discussed more fully elsewhere ( p. 79 ) . The immediate difficulty is the word Guru ' . As the section on Guru ' notes ( see p. ioo ) the term may refer to a human pre-ceptor or to God manifest as the word ( sabd ) . There is no agreement among scholars as to which interpretation is correct here . It is suggested that the Guru is God himself for the following reasons . First , it would be uncharacteristic of Guru Nanak to assert his importance to the extent of suggesting that only through him or at his pleasure is God made known . Second , the Sikh view of revelation is one which insists that God is always revealing himself , that he has done so before and also beyond the teaching of the Gurus . Finally , the subject of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ logical to suppose that he is also the subject of this final phrase . The assertion would seem to be that just as God is self-enlightened so he is the enlightener . He can not be discovered by philosophical study ; austerities will not compel him to appear and incantations , or sacrifices or hymns of devotion can not induce his manifestation : God does what pleases him . No one can say what he should do ' ( AG z ) . The initiative is always God 's . Guru Nanak 's concept of God apparently leaves little place for free will because there is no room for dualism . Everything that happens has been predetermined and occurs because he wills it . By his command ( hukam ) both good and evil happen : God drives all according to his will ( hukam ) , his pen writes our deeds ' ( AG 1241 ) ; Through his will greatness is won , some become high and some low ; some get joy and some pain ; some are lost in transmigration and some are blest by you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is not the complete story . Right living can not achieve release but it can lead to a better life in the next round of existence : Good actions may procure a better frame of 73 Sikh religious thought life , but release comes only through his grace ' ( AG a ) . Man is always free to accept the Guru 's word or reject it even if the opportunity to hear it in the first place is given by God himself . In keeping with the view that God is the only reality and self-revealing is the belief that when he discloses himself man dis-covers his immanence . Like Kabir , Lalla and many other sants , the idea of God residing at home ' is very strong in the teaching of the Gurus . Consequently Guru Nanak recommended the householder stage of life as the one in which his followers should attain God-realisation and explore its meaning . Perhaps Guru Tegh Bahadur expressed the view most forcibly . Why do you go to the forest to find God ? He lives in all and yet remains distinct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resides in a flower or the reflection in a mirror . God abides in everything . See him , therefore , in your own heart . ( AG 684 ) However , unlike some of the other mystics the Sikh asserts that a distinction between God and man does remain even after God-realisation . Guru Arjan wrote , God lives in everything , He dwells in every heart , Yet he is not blended with anything ; He is a separate entity . ( AG 700 ) Despite this stress upon the immanence of God he is also transcendent . The passage quoted above insists on his separate-ness and frequently he is described as the Transcendent Lord . In the Japji Guru Nanak says God is great and his throne is very high . His name is higher than the highest ' ( AG a ) . Ultimately although man discovers that God is within him he recognises that it is more correct to regard himself as existing within God . There is no place for pantheism in Sikh thought . The term panentheism is much more appropriate for everything owes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wise and all knowing God , you are the river . How can I , the fish within you measure your limits . Wherever I look I find no one but you and if ever I were to leave you I would perish . ( AG 25 ) 74 Sikh religious thought The enlightened , God-filled person experiences everything as existing within God and is also aware of God as immanent , but natural man is like a fish who is oblivious of the water in which he swims . It is to this state and his release from it that we must now turn . Man The starting-point for understanding the Sikh view of man must be the statement that all forms have come into existence according to his will ' ( AG I ) . Man is not only the latest or highest product of an evolutionary process or the result of an accident , he is the consequence of God 's intention . God alone knows why he made man or why man is in his natural state of separation from God , ignorant of his will and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dissatisfaction to bewilderment and despair . Concerned with experience , and man 's condition as it is rather than speculation on the reason for the malady , Guru Nanak wrote , Man is born and then dies . Where did he come from ? Say whence did he emerge and whither does he go ? How is he bound to the round of coming and going ( transmigration ) and how is he released ? How may he be united with the Eternal Lord ? He who has the Lord 's name in his heart and on his tongue becomes beyond desire , as the Lord himself is . Man comes and goes in the natural way according to the law of Karma . He is born because of the desires of his mind . The God-minded are emancipated and are not bound again for they dwell on the word sabdj and attain deliverance through the Name . ( AG i 5 z ) This passage does not take us hack to the original mystery of the existence of man but it tells us all that needs to be known for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is caused by desire and may be ended by replacing natural attachments with devotion to God . The round of transmigration was described by Guru Arjan . For many births you have become a worm or moth , an elephant , a fish or a deer . 75 Sikh religious thought In several births you may have become a bird or a snake or may have been yoked as a horse , . or an ox . Meet the Lord of the universe . Now is the time to meet him : after a long time you have been given human form . In many births you were created in rocks and mountains , produced as vegetation , even aborted from the womb . You were made to wander among the eighty four hundred thousand forms of existence . By virtue of the fellowship of the saints ( sangat ) you have achieved your present status so perform the Lord 's service , repeat his name guided by the Guru . ( AG 176 ) No sequence from non-sentient life to fish or bird , to land animal and then to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the progression but it does assert that human existence is the best because man is unique . Among creation he alone possesses discrimination and within him , though latent is a divine spark : O my soul , you have emanated from the light of God , know your true essence ' ( AG 441 ) . Guru Amar Das also said , Man is brimful of the nectar of God 's name . Through tasting it its relish is known . They who taste it become free from fear and find the Lord 's elixir satisfies their needs . He who is made to drink it by the Lord 's grace is never again afflicted by death . ( AG 1092 ) Ignorance is the root of man 's problems . Knowing neither his true nature nor his destiny he is bound to come and go repeatedly . The cry O man you are blessed by being born human , it is an opportunity which you have been given to meet your Lord ' ( AG 378 ) , falls on deaf ears . Man is intelligent , he knows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his heart , yet he misses the chance to meet his Lord . There are several explanations for this failure . His birth and environment may destroy the opportunity if he is born into a family which is a thieves ' kitchen or which inculcates the virtues of self-reliance rather than dependence upon God . The general term used to express failures which fall into this category is karma , the law of cause and effect . One receives in accordance to what one does . As one sows so one eats ' ( AG 662 ) is the simplest way in which Guru Nanak expresses this concept . Our 76 Sikh religious thought present existence is determined by our former behaviour and our conduct now decides the manner in which we will return : Man 's life proceeds as his accumulated actions determine it . He receives joy or sorrow in accordance with what his past deeds have earned . But all is good that comes from you ' ( AG 1107 ) . However , our present failures , unlike those of the past , can not be attributed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ haumai . The former term has been given a section to itself ( see p. 82 ) ; very briefly it means holding a materialist view of the world and therefore living as though its values even its most praiseworthy such as moral rectitude were ends in themselves . Haumai is a difficult idea to render into English . Perhaps self-reliance is as satisfactory a term as any because though haumai results in pride this is not necessarily an immoral state . Self-reliance is often praised as a great human virtue , but for Guru Nanak it is a condition which blinds man to his dependence upon God , to the need for liberation and therefore to the hope of realising it . He even said Man degrades himself from the human order because of his haumai ' ( AG 466 ) . Here we must remember that in Guru Nanak 's teaching human birth was the first step on the road to liberation . It provides the opportunity for meeting God . The consequence of self-reliance is the rejection of this chance and a backward step to animal-like ignorance rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perceive the true nature of liberation . In haumai there is worldly attachment maya and its shadow , doubt . By acting under the influence of haumai man causes himself to be born repeatedly . If he understands haumai he can find the door of liberation but otherwise he argues and disputes . Our karma is inscribed according to the divine will . He who sees the nature of the divine will perceives his haumai also . ( AG 466 ) Dependence upon God and obedience to his will ( hukam ) is essential for liberation . By contradicting the former haumai denies the latter and is therefore , inevitably , subject to the law of karma . The Gurus attach more importance to the impulses of haumai than do any of the other sants , including Kabir , for whereas a person has to accept the consequence of past actions , the present 77 Sikh religious thought and therefore the future as well as his ultimate destiny are to a large degree in his own control . As long as haumai persists , however , it is a cloud blocking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of release . In haumai he comes and in haumai he goes ; In haumai he is born and in haumai he dies ; In haumai he gives and in haumai he takes ; In haumai he acquires and in haumai he casts away ; In haumai he is truthful and in haumai he lies ; In haumai he sometimes does good and at other times evil . ( AG 466 ) Although man can act morally , and many are of upright character , there is literally a world of difference between rebirth and liberation and this the man who is blinded by haumai fails to perceive . Suffering is the form which the condition of haumai takes . It is caused by wrong attachment , by regarding natural relationships as eternal or by substituting these for the one which can not be broken , that between God and the devotee . Guru Tegh Bahadur must not be condemned as a cynic but recognised as a realist when he says , All worldly ties are only for this earthly life , be they those of father , mother , sons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the soul leaves the body they cry Remove this phantom ' . No one keeps it even for an hour . It is hastily taken from the house . Man , reflect on its fate . Consider the earthly creation a mirage . Nanak says , contemplate God 's name , this is how deliverance is attained . ( AG 536 ) According to Guru Nanak physical pain can be therapeutic if it disillusions the self-satisfied : Pain is the remedy and pleasure the sickness ; where there is nothing but pleasure there is no yearning for God ' ( AG 469 ) . The search for God might be the consequence of dissatisfaction or of meeting the Guru ' . Someone may succeed in the moral struggle , in the practice of asceticism , in visiting the pilgrimage centres or mastering the Vedas or the philosophical systems and yet be aware that something is still missing . Such striving is pleasing to God and may win his recognition . On the 78 Sikh religious thought other hand it may be that without conscious effort , perhaps as the result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the latent divinity is activated so that release is obtained . At this point we come to the difficult concept of the grace of God . The problem exists for the western reader because he is already aware that the word has a Christian context and even if he has not studied Pauline theology he knows something of the term because of its popular usage . A word used in the Adi Granth which is translated grace ' is nadar ' which has to do with sight ' . Sikhism is above all else a particular kind of guru cult and it might help to consider a similar word to nadar ' , darshan ' , the Guru 's glance , as we try to understand grace . India is a land of villages , pilgrimage places and gurus . Almost every day there is some local festival , some holy man whose anniversary is being commemorated and in many villages there is a guru to whom people turn for enlightenment and guidance . Some of the gurus become famous beyond the locality and the roads to their teaching centres are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are visited by a small but steady trickle of devotees . Outside the guru 's home the faithful and the hopeful will sit and wait for him to appear . He may be away from the village in which case they will remain until his return . When he does appear there need be no words , merely a benign look of acceptance that is enough to convey a blessing . That glance is darshan . This Sikhism has in mind when it speaks of God 's grace . He is the supreme Guru . Experience teaches that some people make the hard journey of asceticism or moral effort but do not receive this glance of acceptance . Others with but little struggle are not only smiled upon , they are initiated into the close fellowship of disciples . Acceptance or rejection is not arbitrary or the result of some quixotic impulse ; the person who sought darshan and was refused it may be disappointed but the guru knows best . Even the disappointment is a pronouncement of some sort . It may ' be that the seeker must try harder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enlightenment . Baba knows everything ' ; even that the time for release may not be in this present life ; perhaps the next birth will bring acceptance . One thing is certain , the hopeful pilgrim believes that the guru is necessary for liberation . With this concept of guruship in mind it may be possible to understand such apparently harsh sayings as : 79 Sikh religious thought All bounties come from the Lord . No one can claim them as a matter of right . Some who are awake do not receive them , others he rouses from their slumbers to be blessed . ( AG 83 ) Good actions may procure a better existence , but liberation comes only from his grace . ( AG 2 ) God can not be understood or realised through cleverness . ( AG 221 ) God can not be won through rites or deeds . Learning can not give help in comprehending him . The Vedas and the eighteen Puranas have also failed to reveal his mystery . Only the True Guru has revealed him to me . ( AG i S @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way in which God focuses his attention upon a person . No one is ever beyond his care : He takes care of everything , though he remains invisible ' ( AG 7 ) . Even to those who have not found him he is kno4n through dissatisfaction : You are clearly present in the world , Lord , because all crave for your Name ' ( AG 71 ) ; Grace is the means by which this longing is met . It is the special notice which God takes of someone . It can even be a glance of disapproval but then its consequences are disastrous : A displeasing , lance from God reduces even monarchs to straw ' ( AG 472 ) . ; , In the Japji Guru Nanak described five stages of human development . The first was the region or stage of piety ( Dharam Khand ) . This is the realm into which all human beings are born . They may practise devotion and so reach the realm of knowledge ( Gian Khand ) in which they become aware of the vastness of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ progress further , to the realm of effort ( Saram Khand ) . In this stage mind and intellect become perfected or attuned to God . He has now gone as far as he can in developing his natural gifts . The stage of grace ( Karam Khand ) is only possible with the help of spiritual strength which comes from God . Help to enter this realm is willingly given by the loving God . Bhai Gurdas once said , If man goes one step towards him The Lord comes a thousand towards man . 8o Sikh religious thought It is the region in which only the great saints ( bhagats ) live in divine bliss . In the realm of grace spiritual power is supreme , nothing else avails . Brave and strong warriors in whom the Lord 's spirit lives dwell " there , those who are blended with him by singing his praises . Their beauty is beyond description , the Lord lives in their hearts . They do not die and are not deceived . The congregations of the blessed live there too . They dwell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( AG 8 ) Grace in Sikhism has therefore a number of meanings . It is the glance which a Guru bestows upon the disciple denoting acceptance and conveying a blessing . It is also a glance which liberates the devotee in such a way that the efforts which were once undertaken to win recognition are now acts of loving service . Grace also transforms the disciple from being a hopeful seeker to being someone who has found the meaning of his existence . He is now at ease and at peace for he has realised God . However , Karam Khand is not the last region , there is Sach Khand , the region of truth where God exists in his formless state . It can not be described , only experienced by the liberated soul . In the realm of truth Dwells the formless One Who having created watches over his creation . He looks upon them with grace and his people are in bliss . There is world upon world , form on form . All have their functions as God 's will hukam ordains . The Lord @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is hard , hard as steel to the hand . ( AG 8 ) Guru Nanak was acutely aware of the paradoxes which are part of life , of seeking for God but not finding him , of striving but not being satisfied , of knowing that God is latent in everyone yet aware how few know him . The solution lay in the Indian concept of guruship which Guru Nanak accepted but interpreted in his own particular way ( see p . Too ) . Two passages sum up both the paradox and the solution : Inside you is the king 's 81 Sikh religious thought throne , he himself dispenses justice . By the sabad we discover God 's home , his palace is inside us ' ( AG 1092 ) ; Without the grace and guidance of the Guru we can not know the essence of the truth : the unfathomable God lives in everyone ' ( AG 1093 ) . Guru Nana : was also practical and we must turn not only to the concept of liberation but to the techniques which Sikhism advocates for attaining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ term maya ' . Maya Sikhism believes in the reality of the created universe . It accepts it and regards it seriously because it has been made by God . Therefore the world exists for man to use and enjoy , it is not to be shunned or regarded as evil . Maya is a term used to denote the temporal world in the broadest sense and attachment to it . If we are realistic we have to admit that we can not do without maya , when we mean by the word worldly possessions , food and clothing , land upon which to grow the necessities of life . In many of the passages which follow maya ' is translated by the words wealth ' , nature ' or their synonyms . Because God is the sole creator he is responsible for the existence of maya . Through his hidden omnipotence He has created the earth and the sky . Infusing his true might the Lord has sustained them without pillars . The Lord has created the three worlds and their binder , maya , of himself he creates and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world and put it to work . Giving it the intoxicating herb of worldly love to eat thou bast thyself led it astray . ( AG 138 ) The Giver has given man the intoxicating pill of falsehood . Drugged by it he has forgotten death and makes merry for four days . ( AG 15 ) Here we encounter , in a Sikh form , one of the perplexities of monotheism , how the loving and beneficent creator of everything Sikh religious thought can be responsible for evil . With respect to maya the answer lies in two parts . First , despite the impression conveyed by the quotations already given , maya is not an objective reality . It is a subjective error resulting from a wrong point of view , a belief in duality rather than unity , so that like a mirage the world becomes an end in itself . Maya is anything which keeps a person from the truth and union with God . The word may therefore be used of love of family , patriotism , or the service of the gurdwara if devotion becomes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the manner portrayed by the phrase my country right or wrong ' . However , the usual forms ascribed to maya are the five evils of kam , lobh , moh , krodh and ahankar ( lust , covetousness , attachment , wrath and pride ) , basically proper impulses which have got out of hand : Over the whole world is stretched the love of worldly values . Seeing a beautiful woman the lustful man covets her . With his sons and gold man increases his love . He deems everything as his own , he does not heed God ' ( AG 1342 ) . Though God has given man the herb of worldly love this is not his only gift , and here we come to the second part of the Sikh answer . God has also given man power to discriminate and to assist him he has promised his bani and his grace . The handcuff , the net , the snare , which are used as images for maya , need not result in permanent captivity though it is an imprisonment which is consequential upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this way : As is the fire of the womb within , so is the fire of worldliness without . The fires of worldly wealth and of the womb are all the same . The creator has set this play in action . The child is born when it pleases him and the family is happy . Love of the Lord departs , greed attaches itself to the child and maya 's writ begins to run . Such is maya , by which the Lord is forgotten , worldly love wells up and one becomes attached to the love of another . Says Nanak , they who enshrine love for the Lord by God 's grace obtain the Lord in the midst of maya . ( AG 921 ) Attachment to maya is to be replaced by attachment to God , the process of birth by which a person turns from his creator to the world must be reversed . This can be done through nam simran 83 Sikh religious thought ( see p. 89 ) and through the company of the sat sangat , those who themselves have become gurmukh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has created both . To the world plant he has attached two fruits . The creator is himself doer and cause . He feeds whom he likes . On whomsoever he casts his gracious glance he bestows the nectar of his name . He removes his desire for attachment . This God himself performs . ( AG 1172 ) Both the disease is diagnosed and the cure prescribed at length by Guru Nanak in a long analysis containing a variety of examples . Part of it will serve as conclusion to this section : Mad duality has maddened man 's mind . He has wasted his life in the error of greed . Duality clings to mortal man and no one has been able to overcome it . By implanting the name within , the Sat Guru saves man from it . Neither is the mind overpowered nor does maya die . He who has created everything , he alone understands this mystery . Contemplating the sabd one is ferried across the dreadful world ocean . Amassing wealth ( maya ) kings become proud but the loved maya does not depart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but only the name is a lasting friend and comrade . As is a man 's own mind so he perceives another 's to be . As is his desire so becomes his state of mind . As are one 's deeds so is the tune one delights in , but only by seeking the Sat Guru 's advice is the house of peace found . Singing and hearing temporal music man 's mind is attached to duality . Deceit remains within him and he suffers great pain . Meeting with the Sat Guru he is blessed with right understanding and remains merged in love of the true name . Through the sabd he practises truth and sings the true bani and the Lord 's praise which is eternal . Misunderstanding ( maya ) is destroyed through this discipline which makes him acceptable to God . ( AG 1342 ) Maya is not the cosmic illusion of classical Vedanta . It is a materialistic interpretation of reality , it is natural for unregenerate man to be ignorant of God or to view the world in a dualistic 84 Sikh religious thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reality the temporal will be merged in the eternal and maya will no longer exist . Mukti ? the path of liberation Sacrifices , burnt offerings , charity given to acquire merit , austerities , even worship , are all worthless and the body continues to endure suffering . Without the name of God there is no release . He who , with the Guru 's help , meditates on Nam finds liberation . Without God 's Name birth into this world is fruitless . Without the Name one eats poison , speaks evil , dies meritless and so transmigrates . ( AG 1127 ) Liberation is release from the round of death and rebirth to the attainment of union with God . It can occur only when the soul has reached the stage of Saram Khand , the realm of effort , and is now in a position to enjoy God 's kindly glance and so enter the realm of grace . Effort can take him no further and therefore such techniques as yoga or asceticism are rejected as futile : Stubborn self torture only wears out the body , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is as efficacious as the Lord 's Name ; serve the Guru my soul , and keep the company of the servants of God . ( AG 905 ) Only God in his manifest forms of sabd , nam and Sat Guru can take the soul further , to ultimate bliss . This fifth and final state Guru Nanak described as Sach Khand , the realm of truth . Another name is chautha pad , the fourth state which is beyond the three gunas or qualities which are believed to condition character . These are passion , which causes inertia and forgetful-ness ; desire , which stimulates ambition and produces restless activity , and peace , which is conducive to serenity but can degenerate into indifference . Chautha pad is attained by con-quering the mind , for it is the key both to bondage and to liberation . The word personality ' might be used to try to approach the one Punjabi term man ' which refers to the com-bination of mind , heart and soul . In its natural state it is dominated by the three gunas . The consequence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equipoise sahaj and wandering in doubt ' ( AG 68 ) . 85 Sikh religious thought Guru Nanak does not explain the fourth state of chautha pad but he does describe the results : Neither hope nor desire concern me and I have renounced longing for the three gunas . By seeking the refuge of the saints the God-minded attain the fourth state ' ( AG 3 56 ) . The word used for God-minded ' is gurmukh ' . Literally it contrasts so-called liberation to natural personality ( manmukh ) , which is actually bondage , with liberation to God-mindedness which is the true meaning of release from karma and haumai . Only the God-minded person is really free . Sahaj is the word which Guru Nanak most frequently used for this state . It describes the equipoise and tranquillity which the soul enjoys beyond the reach of transmigration . The word was also popular with Kabir and the other sants . Turya avastha and param pad are tantric Buddhist terms which are given the same meaning as sahaj in Sikh teaching . Almost by definition this state of bliss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have the following things to say about it . Guru Arjan tried to express it through the idea of love . In the words of a bride he wrote : My friends met me and they asked me to describe my husband . I was so filled with the bliss of his love that I could n't answer them ! ' ( AG 4S9 ) . All she can say is that when she lies in her husband 's arms she experiences peace , joy and bliss . In another hymn he used more matter-of-fact language but the emphasis . was much the same : The man who has the love of God 's commands in his heart is said to be jivan mukt liberated whilst in the body . For him release is a present reality ; joy and sorrow are both the same to him , his happiness is eternal and there is no separation from God . As is gold so is dust ; as is nectar so is bitter poison . Honour and dishonour are the same . The pauper and the king are alike . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God , is said to be liberated whilst in the body . ( AG 275 ) To be jivan mukt is possible because release is the supreme state of living in God 's presence . The least acceptable of all unsatis-factory descriptions is that of being merged in the Absolute , even though the Gurus use the language of absorption in their attempt to express this experience of union with God . 86 Sikh religious thought As a million sparks rise from a single fire , separate and come together again as they fall back into it : As from a heap of dust grains are blown upwards , fill the air and then drop back onto the heap : As drops of water come from a single stream and return to it : So inanimate and live creation emerges from God 's form , and since they arise from him they will return again . ( Akal Ustad ) Descriptions of heaven also make the point that bliss is being in God 's presence now or hereafter . Heaven is wherever God 's praise is sung ' ( AG 749 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pilgrimage are wherever the saints put their feet , heaven is wherever they utter the Name ' ( AG 890 ) . Hell , on the other hand , is any place where deceit is found ( AG 315 ) . The popular image of heaven as a place of comfort and pleasure is rejected . Guru Nanak declared , The man who longs for God 's abode is unconcerned with heaven and hell ' ( AG 360 ) , and the Fifth Guru even dismissed the concept of mukti as freedom from rebirth , replacing it with experiencing the presence of God : I desire neither worldly power nor mukti . My soul longs to embrace your lotus feet . There are Brahma , Shiva , yogis and sages as well as Indra but I desire nothing but seeing the Lord ' ( AG 5 34 ) ? Heaven without God is not really heaven ( AG 707 ) , it is merely a transitory state like the respite from rebirth which some Hindu myths describe as the reward for asceticism . Once the merit has been used up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abode of permanent release , the presence of God . Everyone longs for paradise swarg , mukti and heaven baikundh and rests all hope on them . Those who desire the vision of God do not seek release , they are satisfied and comforted by that sight alone . The attachment of maya is powerful but the saints are like the duck which sits on the pond but does not get its wings wet . ( AG 1324 ) There is a belief in judgment but this is a continuous process . After death the soul appears before God and its future is decided on the basis of actions while in the world . It may be reborn or 87 Sikh religious thought obtain some temporary respite or may remain in the presence of God , its development being complete . Liberation is obtained by meeting the Guru , enjoying his grace and then adopting certain techniques . The most important of these is nam simran , meditation upon the name and nature of God , which is discussed in detail on pages 89-95 . However , this should be accompanied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fellowship of believers . Good company is essential for godly living . In good company one becomes good , ' said Guru Nanak ( AG 414 ) . The Fourth Guru saw it as having particular value for the weak : Just as the castor oil plant imbibes the scent of the nearby sandalwood so the fallen become emancipated through the company of the faithful ' ( AG 861 ) . Both Nath yogis and Sufis as well as some north Indian Hindu sects lived in groups and saw the value of corporate religious life . This belief Guru Nanak and his successors clearly shared . The sangat was the treasure house in which the Name was to be found , according to Guru Arjan . In it Birth and rebirth , worldly attachment and suffering vanish away ' ( AG 761 ) . From the time of the Third Guru , who , it will be remembered , had the task of welding a second generation of believers into a coherent socio-religious group , the importance of the sangat in the hymns of the Gurus increases noticeably . Sometimes they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as Guru Arjan did : Nanak 's compassionate master is merciful to the meek . My burning has been cooled in the saint 's fellowship ' ( AG 204 ) . In the fellowship of the sangat the life of effort continues but it is no longer a striving to reach the threshold of the stage of grace ; it is sewa , the joyful service of the Lord . Its purpose is to obey God 's will joyfully , not to attempt to win his grace . This has already been obtained . The effect is to become more God-like , for One becomes like the one he serves ' ( AG 224 ) . The consequence of this devotion is that one becomes brahm-gyani , filled with the knowledge of God which is the ideal after which the Sikh strives . On death there is no returning but eternal life in God 's presence , in that perfect fellowship of which the earthly sangat is the mirror . There is one exception to this . It may be that God wishes a perfected being to return to earth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ task which he desires to have accomplished . Such a person will already be brahm-gyani at birth . His entry into the world will be non-karmic , not the result of the law of karma but because of God 's commandment ( hukam ) . According to Bala Janam Sakhi accounts , Guru Nanak 's entry into the world was of this type . Certainly this is the way in which Guru Gobind Singh regarded himself according to his autobiographical poem Vichitar Natak . Such a birth is not a cause for pride but an opportunity for sewa , and its purpose is to bring the light of God-realisation to other human beings . The concept of nonkarmic rebirth is another illustration of the belief that there is a higher state than that of being released from transmigration ; that of being in God 's presence and service , which is a purely spiritual condition . Nam simran The easiest way to avoid oversimplifying one of the richest and most profound concepts of Sikhism , that of Nam , is to allow a number of quotations from the teachings of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creation , There is no place where Nam is not . ( AG 4 ; ist Guru ) Nam gives form to everything , Through Nam comes all wisdom and light . ( AG 986 ; 1st Guru ) Nam is the creator of everything , To be divorced from Nam is death . ( AG 603 ; 3rd Guru ) All creatures live by Nam , Nam supports the universe and its parts . ( AG 284 ; 5th Guru ) From these passages it can be seen that Nam must be more than merely Name , its literal translation must in some way be synonymous with God . There are words of Guru Nanak 's about God which make almost exactly the same statements as those expressed above : 89
