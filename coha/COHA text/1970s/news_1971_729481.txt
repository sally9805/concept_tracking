txt For 20 years the Deep South has been climbing the lower and middle slopes of economic growth at a rapid clip ? the rate of climb unmatched by any other major reeion of the United States . But now it has reached that point where the going gets toughest . From now on " it 's going to be a slower and more difficult climb in terms of the most highly desirable ' economic growth , " says Robert B. Cassell , director of the industrial development division of the Georgia Institute of Technology here . Mr. Cassell provides research and advice to private and public agencies in a six-state area : Alabama , Florida , Georgia , North Carolina , South Carolina , and Tennessee . Huge increases since ' 47 Recent figures indicate these six states have tremendously increased their manufacturing employment and income since 1947 . North Carolina ? leading industrial state in the Southeast ? now has 650,000 manufacturing employees , compared with some 350,000 in 1947 . Georgia and Tennessee both have some 450,000 persons in industrial jobs now , double what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the South 's major industrial states , nonetheless has experienced a huge jump in manufacturing employment ? from less than 100,000 to about 300,000 today . South Carolina has gone from some 150,000 to 300,000 in manufacturing in those years . Alabama is least developed of the six states , in spite of having the only real industrial city in the Southeast ? Birmingham . It has some 300,000 persons in manufacturing now , a growth of about 100,000 in the last 23 years . Problems still around As it nears new economic peaks , the South is having to face new problems  --  and some old ones , too : ? The extent to which the poor ? especially blacks  --  are excluded from sharing in the new prosperity . ? Problems stemming from increasing urbanization wrought by industrial concentration . One incentive for industries to move South has been the inviting environment . Some of that pastoral aura has inevitably disappeared , Says Harry Brandt of the Federal Reserve Bank in Atlanta : // *Dixie faces slow signs after fast economic rise // " Like other Americans , Southerners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not be an end in itself . More attention has been given in 1970 to the quality of life than ever before , and in the future it is almost certain to receive more emphasis . " Industrial growth has escalated per capita income in the South toward the national average . But the pace has slowed recently , notes Mr. Cassell . Using 100 to represent the national average , the South moved from 58 on the scale in 1950 up to 68 in 1960 Upward climb slows But the figure for 1970 is around 72 , indicating that while the upward rate continues it is getting more difficult Meanwhile , the highest per capita income area , the Far West , has been moving downward ? from 123 on the scale to about 118 now ? as income levels across the nation slowly level out . Mr. Brandt of the Sixth Federal Reserve District , writing in the Federal Reserve Bank 's Monthly Review , noted : " By almost every statistic , the economy of the Sixth District states  --  Alabama , Florida , Georgia , Louisiana @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ' 60 's . Personal income , the best regional yardstick available , more than doubled . .. . " Southeastern economic growth looks less spectacular when one takes population growth into account and considers that other regions have also experienced considerable economic growth .. . . Per capita income in the Southeast has inched only slightly closer to the national iveragP " Georgia Tech 's Mr. Cassell foresees " no sharp turns or curves in Southern economic growth " for the next few years " The Southeast has a lot of momentum now , " he adds , " and there is no question that the upward movement will continue . " He says Southern states now will have to go after the " high technology " industries in which they are deficient . One shortcoming in measuring economic progress by employment figures ? an oft-used yardstick  --  is that " a job in a garment sweatshop is equated with one in an aircraft factory , " notes Mr. Cassell . In actual wages , benefits , and skills the jobs are , of course , quite dissimilar . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carolina in terms of manufacturing growth . But , admits Mr. Cassell , " three of the four major employers in Georgia are ones whose wages nationally are below the average manufacturing wage . " Those three industries are apparel , food , and textiles ; the state 's fourth major industry is transportation ? a booming technological field that of late has turned somewhat sour . Special growth expected In spite of recent rough going in the aerospace industry , Mr. Cassell sees that field and industries keyed to undersea development as major areas of concentration in the Southeast . He also expects greater emphasis on the manufacture of bio-medical supplies and equipment . At the same time the U.S. economy dipped in 1970 , a major Southern industry  --  textiles  --  was undergoing its own peculiar recession . This had special effects on four states  --  Alabama , Georgia , North Carolina , and South Carolina  --  where textile activity is heaviest . But what Mr. Cassell calls " momentum " kept the situation from getting out of hand . Georgia has been hit recently , too , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been well publicized by North American Rockwell ( at Albany ) and Grumman ( at Savannah ) also have suffered . Yet , the state 's economy continues to hum Next : The " urban magnet " in the South .
