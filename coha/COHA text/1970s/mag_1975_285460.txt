Clemert Lee has been a Denver Post reporter , a saxophonist and clarinetist , a court reporter and a Navy security guard . Now , however , Lee is 80 and , because " no one wants to hire a man my age , " he went into business for himself three years ago . His job , as he puts it , is " cleaning up America . " <P> With his wife of 52 years , Lee tramps along the West 's interstate highways , picking up aluminum beer and soft-drink cans . " Ai n't people nasty the way they throw junk all over the roadside ? " said Lee last week , taking a break along the shoulder of Highway 15 in the middle of the Mojave Desert . He shuffled a half mile back down the road to a camper where his wife Grace , 72 , was watching over a dozen sacks and cardboard cartons brimful with cans . " It 's just terrible to see this litter , " she said . " But picking it up is fun . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <P> The Lees can collect as many as 500 cans a day , which they sell for about $20 to a salvage dealer near their home in San Diego . But they profess not to be worried about the low monetary return . Says Clemert Lee : " Cleaning up America is better than sitting at home twiddling my thumbs . "
