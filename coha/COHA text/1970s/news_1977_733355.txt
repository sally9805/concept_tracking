txt President Carter can not have it both ways next year . If he tries to cut taxes at the same time that he tries to reform them , he may fail at both objectives . The tax cut deserves priority . Without it , the nation may sink again into recession . Tax reform , which we strongly endorse , can wait until 1979 and a new Congress . The President 's political energy will be needed in 1978 for passage of any innovative , anti-inflation tax cut . The case for a tax cut has become increasingly compelling . Whatever merit it may have internationally , a cut is needed for domestic reasons alone : 32 months since the end of this nation 's worst postwar recession , the United States economy is heading into a period of extremely slow growth . Consumers , who have spurred the recovery so far by spending their money , are not expected to provide much new steam for the economy in 1978 . Business , depressed by the stagflation of recent years and worried by President Carter 's policy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next year . Though there might be enough growth left in the economy to move unemployment down a bit in 1978 ? there might not be . Perhaps this risk would be worth taking if there were gains to be made against inflation by suffering a longer period of high unemployment . But inflation for two years has hovered around 6 percent , despite excess production capacity . Continued slow growth holds no promise of lower inflation ? at least not for years . Meanwhile , the cost in wasted productive power and wasted lives is enormous . The nation , however , can not turn to a tax cut without caution . A cut in taxes , with a companion rise in the Federal deficit , would inevitably trigger fears of worse inflation , fears that could easily became self-fulfilling if business and labor acted on them . That would turn the tax cut into a futile exercise  --  bringing on the recession it was designed to avert . The weeks ahead , therefore , are precious time for the President , for Congress and for the nation 's political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ timing of a tax cut . More important , they must also decide upon what kind of tax cut . Some tax relief must certainly go to business , which is suffering from a chronic drop in profitability and an acute drop in confidence . Some of the cut must go to individual taxpayers , who have been shoved into ever-higher tax brackets during the past two years by illusory , inflationary increases in income . But no taxes should be cut at all until a serious intellectual effort has been made to design a cut that encourages anti-inflationary behavior by business and labor . Taxes , after all , can be used as a carrot ( tax credits ) or as a stick ( tax surcharges ) to encourage socially responsible behavior . If done cautiously , such fiscal reform should not interfere unduly with tax simplification , a central theme of tax reform . So far , discussion of such " fiscal reform " has been muted because of the Administration 's reluctance to frighten businessmen or labor leaders . They are too quick to depict any talk of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But why should not Government use a tax cut to encourage restraint in wage and price decisions ? Ideas for such an anti-inflation tax cut have been offered by Arthur Okun of the Brookings Institution , Henry Wallich of the Federal Reserve Board , and Sidney Weintraub of the University of Pennsylvania . They would use the marketplace , not the Government bureaucracy , to enforce restraint ; they would use tax incentives , riot rigid wage-price controls , to encourage good behavior . Their approach is to set a national wage standard and ask business and labor to adhere to it  --  and they would reward such conduct . Other ideas for the creative use of a tax cut might be on other minds . Let the White House seek out such thinking in the critical weeks ahead . If tax reform is to be postponed , then let true fiscal reform take its place . Otherwise the President and his advisers will merely condemn the nation to another period of stagflation and the tax cut of 1978 would become the tragedy of 1979.      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
