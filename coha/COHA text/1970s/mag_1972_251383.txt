What has a pot belly , rides eight motorcycles and does nothing with its left arm but throw bullets ? The answer : 6-ft. 1-in. , 207-lb . Mickey Lolich , left-handed mound ace of the Detroit Tigers . Mickey explains the pot easily . " Big bellies run in my family . All the male Lolichs have them . " The cycle fetish and the sinistral fastball derive from a childhood accident . When Lolich was a lad of three in Portland , Ore. , his tricycle collided with a motorcycle , which crushed his left shoulder . Although the shoulder healed properly , the doctor gave Mickey throwing exercises to strengthen his arm . The exercises worked so well that now , at 31 , Lolich is baseball 's premier lefthanded hurler . As for the bikes : " My mother hated motorcycles , so naturally I had to have one . " <P> Lolich grew up contrary , but if he had not , baseball might well have made him so . For nine years he has been one of the game 's outstanding pitchers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shadow of Babe Ruth and then Joe DiMaggio , Lolich has usually seemed to be second best . He had the initial misfortune of being teamed with the Peck 's Bad Boy of baseball , Denny McLain . The outstanding performance of Lolich 's career-three World Series victories over the St. Louis Cardinals in 1968 - was virtually lost in the glare of McLain 's 31 victories that season . In 1971 , Lolich won 25 games and struck out 308 batters , tops in either league . He also pitched 376 innings ( the most by a major league hurler in 55 years ) and threw 29 complete games ( the most by an American League pitcher since 1946 ) . So who won the 1971 Cy Young Award as the league 's outstanding pitcher ? Oakland 's highly publicized Vida Blue . <P> All of which has understandably nettled Lolich . On the eve of McLain 's 30th victory in 1968 , Mickey posted a sign in the Tiger clubhouse : ATTENTION WRITERS : THIS WAY TO MCLAIN 'S LOCKER . As for the Cy Young Award , Lolich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system of his own based on the number of starts , victories , strikeouts , etc . As he points out : " The award , then , would n't be based on whim . Of course , the baseball writers are n't about to give up their right to be supreme judges . " <P> Apart from his occasional feeling of neglect , Lolich is a convivial , freewheeling sort . To the dismay of his wife and Tiger Manager Billy Martin , he often rides a motorcycle 28 miles to work from his home in the Detroit suburb of Washington . Last year , when for the first time in his career he won his 20th game , Lolich sprung for six bottles of champagne for his teammates . This season , the honors that have long eluded him are in view . McLain is in the minors , and Blue , after a lengthy holdout , has yet to win a game . Meanwhile , Lolich is bewildering American League batsmen with a repertory of pitches that now includes a " cut fastball , " a slider and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last week made him the second pitcher this season to win nine games and left the Tigers a comfortable four games ahead of the Baltimore Orioles in the league 's East Division .
