Gone are the agony and ecstasy <P> Romantic love was introduced to Western culture by late 11th century troubadours . Since then the telltale symptoms - pain of longing , wide-eyed idealization of the beloved and vibrato of the soul - have become established as the preferred form of sexual attraction . Now , however , it may be nearing the end of its 900-year run . According to a Michigan State University psychologist , romantic love is dying out . Claims Professor G. Marian Kinget : " One is bound to conclude that the very conditions for romantic love have ceased to exist . " <P> For one thing , Kinget says , the idealization of lovers has given way to " reality testing " - young people are casting a cold eye on prospective mates to check for flaws . Social assumptions that promote romantic love-e.g. , women are weak and need protection-are rapidly breaking down and " extended longing " crucial to romantic love has been dealt a death blow by casual sex and the easy availability of birth control . Says Kinget : " The notions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have become meaningless-in fact , quaint . " <P> She sees some negative consequences : " a certain flattening of personality " and perhaps " a stunting effect on creativity , devotion , courage and similar forms of transcendence . Has it not been said that if Dante had married Beatrice , we would not have had the Divina Commedia ? " <P> But Kinget also has some good news : the passing of romantic love may mean " greater emotional and social stability " and the disappearance of marriages " founded on mutual illusions and cosmetic images . " Take that , Erich Segal .
