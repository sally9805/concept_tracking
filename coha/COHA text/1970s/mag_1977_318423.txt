HENRY 'S FATE by JOHN BERRYMAN <P> Selected by JOHN HAFFENDEN <P> 94 pages . Farrar , Straus &; Giroux . <P> $7.95 . <P> Posthumous selections of unpublished poetry should be viewed suspiciously . The dead poet may have had good aesthetic reasons for keeping some of his work to himself . Fortunately , Henry 's Fate does not malign the memory of John Berryman , who five years ago committed suicide at age 57 . Critic John Haffenden has gathered 45 " Dream Songs " written after 77 Dream Songs ( 1964 ) and His Toy , His Dream , His Rest ( 1968 ) - the two books that certified Berryman as a major American writer . Henry , the fast-talking middle-aged hero of the dream songs , continued to suffer and thrive in Berryman 's imagination-and does so again in Henry 's Fate . <P> The poet 's alter ego travels to Venice . Henry worries over " his failing life , / his whiskey curse , his problems with his wife . " He watches his young daughter grow older and thinks : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the depths of her childhood , when bearded Daddy was any . " Though Berryman could movingly record Henry 's despair at the deaths of friends , the poet could also tease his own creation : <P> Henry under construction was <P> Henry indeed : <P> gigantic cranes faltered under the <P> load , <P> spark-showers from the welding <P> played <P> with daylight , crew after crew <P> replaced each other like Kings , <P> all done anew <P> Daily , to the horror of the <P> gathering crowd <P> which gazed in a silence of awe <P> or sobbed aloud . <P> The 25 non-Henry poems included here lack some of this edgy vitality , although in the prologue to a work he never wrote , Berryman could open a prayer for inspiration in typically boisterous manner : " So screw you , Muses . " Late in the book a poem begins " I did n't . And I didn't. " - celebrating a suicide urge that the poet had resisted . Some 40 hours after he wrote these lines , Berryman did . <P> <P> GEOGRAPHY III <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &; Giroux . <P> $7.95 . <P> <P> The loudest complaint made about Elizabeth Bishop 's poetry is that there is not more of it . The Complete Poems ( 1969 ) filled only about 200 pages , with margins to spare . Geography III adds ten more poems to the Bishop canon , and there are more than a few poets who would burn their manuscripts to have written one of them . <P> Bishop 's power still rests in a cool lucidity , in a restraint that prevents word , phrase and sentence from doing more ( or less ) than is necessary . In some instances , only the typography indicates that she is writing poetry and not prose : <P> In Worcester , Massachusetts , <P> I went with Aunt Consuelo <P> to keep her dentist 's appointment <P> and sat and waited for her <P> in the dentist 's waiting room . <P> After this laconic beginning , Bishop needs only a prop-a copy of National Geographic-and a small cry of pain from the dentist 's chair to create a child 's epiphanic moment : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was sliding/ beneath a big black wave , / another , and another . " <P> Geography III includes touches of the exotic . Robinson Crusoe , old , embittered and safely beached in England , remembers his island : <P> And I had waterspouts . Oh ,
