The fighting in South Viet Nam ceased for 24 hours last week , to mark a Christmas truce . Meanwhile a crucial but often forgotten war continues in Cambodia-and , with the advent of the dry season , is gaining in intensity . There the Communist forces , composed primarily of North Vietnamese regulars , plus some Viet Cong and Cambodian Khmer Rouge , are as determined as ever to isolate the capital of Phnom-Penh from the rest of the country and thus discredit or even oust the " salvation government " of Premier Lon Nol . <P> In the capital itself , the Communists have been responsible for a wave of terrorist bombings . In the countryside , they seized the offensive after their setback last fall at Taing Kauk ( TIME . Oct. 19 ) . A month ago , they cut Route Four , the main road between Phnom-Penh and the deepwater port of Kompong Som , and the Cambodian army has not yet been able to reopen it . The result is a serious fuel shortage in Phnom-Penh . So far there has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refugees has increased the capital 's population from 500.000 to almost 2.000,000 since last March . Throughout the country , the Cambodians have lost approximately ten battalions in as many weeks . <P> Despite such setbacks , U.S. military observers in Southeast Asia are not pessimistic about the situation . They point out that the I on Nol government has shown a surprising degree of staying power , and that Cambodia 's once ridiculed army has been fighting bravely . The army is being increased by about one battalion a week-enough to offset the losses-and its position is reinforced by the presence in Cambodia of more than 12.000 South Vietnamese troops . <P> Niqht Strike . Given continued U.S. and South Vietnamese air support , observers believe , the Cambodian army should be able to hold its own .

At the height of the battle , Srey Yar sent a radio message to Lon Nol promising that he and his men would not surrender . Even though they ran short of ammunition and food , and were outnumbered by about 5 to 1 , they kept their word , but the cost was fearfully high . Of the 400 Cambodians , 50 were killed and 300 wounded , including 114 critically . Estimates of enemy soldiers killed ranged from 500 to 2,000 . After the battle , a French journalist reported that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chained to their machine guns and had died there .
