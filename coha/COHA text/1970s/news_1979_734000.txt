" The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ross Lathrop f5thl criticized the snow removal program . saying " the Bilandic blizzard of 1979 shows that this is a fair weather administration . " Administration aldermen leaped to their feet to defend the mayor , while Bilandic retorted that , " I have been all over your ward and I never once saw you . " Under the auto repair shop ordinance , all shops in the city must provide customers with cost estimates for labor and parts . The bill can not exceed 10 per cent of the estimate or $15 , whichever is less .
