Economy &; Business <P> <P> But it will be short , mild and help curb prices , say TIME 'S economists <P> Question : What should a Government do when its economic policy seems likely to drive the nation into a recession ? <P> Answer : Hold fast to that stringent policy . Let the recession come , if need be . More than that , aim for the downturn to be followed not by a vigorous rebound in production and jobs but by a year or two of only moderate growth . <P> A year ago , that reply would have seemed a fearful sin against the spirit of liberal economic doctrine-to say nothing of the spirit in which Jimmy Carter campaigned for the White House . But in the past twelve months , economic and political thought has gone through a wrenching change . In the words of Economist Otto Eckstein , a member of TIME 'S Board of Economists : " 1978 was the year in which our nose was rubbed in the new reality . " Part of the new reality is that inflation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pervasive , and that it has built up such terrifying momentum in the U.S. as to be unstoppable , for the moment , unless the nation reduces the roughly 4%-per-year economic growth rate that it had come to consider normal . <P> This year , real gross national product - total output of goods and services , discounted for inflation-probably rose only 3.8% . But consumer prices jumped so rapidly that in December they are likely to average 9.5% higher than at the end of last year . Result : the President , who began the year trying to prod the economy to faster growth , shifted gradually to a tight-budget policy and proclaimed wage-price guidelines that stop just short of mandatory controls . When even those measures failed to stop inflation and the sickening plunge of the dollar , President Carter on Nov. 1 welcomed a sharp increase in interest rates that normally would have violated his populist principles . <P> Carter still argues that these steps will curb the inflation without causing a slump in 1979 . Last week he told a meeting of the Business Council that " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he added that warnings of one " can become a self-fulfilling prophecy . " But among the ten members of TIME 'S Board of Economists , only University of Minnesota Professor Walter Heller will give even fifty-fifty odds on avoiding a downturn . The others all agree that there will be a recession , but that it will be mild and brief , lasting only two or three quarters and at worst dragging real G.N.P . down at an annual rate of only 1% to 2% . All this will dent inflation-but only a bit . To ensure that inflation will continue to decline even after the recession ends , economic growth will have to be held below the old 4% norm for some years to come .
