txt The Bethlehem Steel Corporation , the nation 's second largest steel producer , reported yesterday a net loss of $477 million in the third quarter , the largest ever for a quarter for an American company . The previous largest loss for a single quarter was reported by the RCA Corporation ? a $250 million deficit in the third quarter in 1972 . Even in the giant Penn Central bankruptcy , losses amounted to just $326 million for the full year of 1970 , immediately prior to its collapse . Lewis W. Foy , the chairman of Bethlehem , said in a statement that by far the largest part of the net loss came from a pretax charge of $750 million that resulted from the closing down of plants in Johnstown , Pa. , and Lackawanna , N.Y. , which led to the permanent layoff of 7,300 workers . Offset by Tax Savings Before taxes , Bethlehem sustained an $894 million loss for the quarter , including the enormous $750 million write-off . That loss was offset in part by $417 million in current and future tax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the taxes that Bethlehem , without the huge tax deductions , would otherwise owe . The huge write-off does not mean that Bethlehem faces an immediate cash drain of that magnitude . Bethlehem , having decided to shut plants and lay off workers , must take immediate account of the total costs of doing so ? as best those costs can be estimated , just as a wage-earner informally counts against his Christmas budget bills he wo n't pay till March . " Under generally accepted accounting principles , " Mr. Foy said , " Bethlehem must immediately recognize all estimated costs of the closing of such facilities and employee terminations , even though the major portion of these costs is payable in the future . " He added that the cutbacks by 1tetil1ehem , which have been the largest pf any of the nation 's ailing steel &ompanies,; would " leave Bethlehem in a stronger and leaner condition to take advartage of opportunities for profit and growth . " The net loss of $477 milliort h the third quarter contrasts with a profit of $45.5 million , or $1.04 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The pretax loss of $894 million breaks down as follows : $167 million for the ' write-off of closed facilities , $483 million for the estimated pension benefits to be paid to terminated employees , $40 million for a pretax charge of expenses of the flood in Johnstown , and $104 million of operatin7 , losses . I 90,000 Before Cutbacks Bethlehem , which before recent severe cutbacks employed 90,000 workers in r.aior steel facilities in Bethlehem , Pa. , Johnstown , Lackawanna and Sparrows Point , Md. , is one of the least diversified companies in the industry and therefore has been particularly vulnerable to the downturn in demand for steel and competition from imports . About 90 percent of its earnings come from steel . By comparison , United States Steel , the nation 's largest producer , gets less than half its earnings from steel . Even with diversification , U.S. Steel reported Tuesday that its third-quarter earnings were down 75.9 percent because of a sharp drop in the profitability of steel operations . Among other steel companies Wheeling-Pittsburgh reported a net loss of $4.6 ' million in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 47.6 percent , and National Steel , a drop of 53.7 percent . In August , Bethlehem , which produces about 14 percent of the nation 's steel , announced that it would cut hack its 7tcel-rtrking capacity by 10 percent . In September . it said that it was eliminating ' he ' obs of 2,500 white-collar workers . ' e cPmpany has reduced its capital spending by about $200 million through the end of next year . Its Johnstown operations were severely disrupted by the flood last July 20 . Mr. Foy announced after the flood that Bethlehem was cutting back its employment there to 7,500 jobs from 11.500 . For the first nine months of 1977 , Bethlehem incurred a net loss of $467.4 mil1 lion . Net income for the first nine months of 1976 was $128.3 million , or $2.94 a share . Despite the earnings problems , Bethlehem 's board declared a regular dividend of 25 cents a share of common stock at its meeting yesterday . In his statement , Mr. Foy warned that " the difficulties confronting us have not disappeared . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He also said that major capital spending for pollution control equipment remained ahead . Last Sept. 22 , the company agreed to a consent decree with the Maryland Department of Natural Resources to clean up water discharge from its SparPo:nt plant . As part of the settlement , Bethlehem paid $500,000 in penaltie and fees . The layoffs and plant closings by Bethlehem have affected regions in the coontr , that were already depressed economically and will have the biggest difficulties in recovering .
