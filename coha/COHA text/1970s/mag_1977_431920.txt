CONFESSIONS OF A TOWN COUNCILMAN THIRTEEN of 16 election districts were in , and I was 150 votes behind . The verdict was there in unyielding numbers : I was going to lose . Since . l seem persevering and optimistic by nature , many people had figured I was going to win , despite the fact that no Democrat had been elected to a policy-making position in our town in this century , and I had never run for anything before . My smile was growing strained . I needed to win each of the remaining districts by 5o votes , and I had not won even one district by that much . There had been two months of full-time campaigning for a parttime job as a Town Councilman that paid $2000 a year . I was my own campaign manager , so I wrote brochure and six radio commercials about myself , bumper stickers a buttons about myself ( " I 'm a Lem Aide " ) , introduced myself at abo 2000 doorways , and talked abo myself at 26 coffee parties . The had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , worn and kids . And the uncaring figur now said : Nice try . Then Election District 11 came i and I had won it by 41 votes . Election District 16 came in . I II won it by 51 votes , and a crazy chi went up . Then Election District 4 can in . I had won it by 71 votes ? and the election by 13 votes . The yelli and hugging and crying start ! 22 NEW YORK NEWS ( OCTOBER 21 , 176 ) , ? 1976 BY NEW YORK NEWS , INC.2220 E. 42 ST. , NEW YORK , N.Y . 10017 MAKING DEMOCRACY WORK  | then , and two pals raised my arms high in vicotry . Now IT IS SEVEN YEARS LATER . I have been re-elected once by 300 votes and I sit at Town Board meetings , behind my nameplate , trying to stay awake and interested through 34-item agendas . My accomplishments ? A partial scorecard : 1 . As the first Democratic Councilman in the Town of Bedford , New York , in this century , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more of my kind . 2 . I have broken one campaign promise ? to send out a newsletter four times a year . I got out two newsletters and found I did n't have enough time to do more . 3 . I have stood up before 350 angry citizens and taken over the defense of an unpopular cause from the Town Supervisor , of the rival party , because it seemed the right thing to do . Then , having demonst rated virtue and reason , I wound tip shaking my fist at a friend . I have learned to accept being called a liar , lazy , devious , stupid , cynical , unpatriotic and dishonest without getting Iliad , at least most of the time . 4 . Yet people are almost never tide when you are out campaigning and appear unannounced in their luorway . Most seem vaguely flattered to see a real live candidate iii their doorstep ? not sweet-talking hem on TV but at their own door . 5 . I have learned that when citiens think they are in the majority , hey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and when they think they are in the minority , they demand that you exercise leadership by not giving in to political pressure . 6 . I have learned that small-time politics mirrors big-time politics in the way that Little League mirrors ' major-league baseball : the rules , goals , attitudes of the fans and emotions of the players are basically the same for both . 7 . I have learned that what motivates politicians , including myself , is an unholy mixture of ego and the desire to serve ( in a wrestling match to see which was stronger , I would bet on ego ) . I enjoy finding the best solution to a problem ? even though it 's often only making the best of a bad situation . I enjoy praising someone who deserves it , and seeing my name in the papers . I enjoy having the kind of power I know how to handle , and laughing at myself when I feel like a big shot . WHAT SORT OF THINGS do I dislike ? Mrs. Garfield 's drainage. * It represents all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the beginning I assumed I could help people who had problems ? water running off a town road and wrecking Mrs. Garfield 's lawn , say . Now I know the odds are against me . First I have to get the Highway Superintendent and Town Engineer to figure out what 's wrong . They have to take time off from a milliondollar water study to do that . Then , . it 123  | if it is the Town 's fault , we must find out how much it will cost to fix and whether the harm being done to Mrs. Garfield justifies spending that much of the other taxpayers ' money . Everybody in politics sours a bit on the populace sooner or later . Some politicians conclude that the voters are loony , and when a complaint comes in they assume it 's exaggerated or groundless . I still assume that the problem is real and important to that person at least . But I know there 's a discouraging chance that we ca n't or should n't do anything about it . Yet , if we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few hundred feet where I 've had some sort of impact : here 's where I helped the Supervisor set up a connection for emergency water supply , here are four tennis courts we built , here 's where we kept New York City from building a large garage , here 's where we got the state to fix a dangerous curve . But some of those things would have happened regardless of who was in office . MRS . WALLENSY in the fifth row is brooding as the Town Board holds its monthly public meeting . Occasionally she fixes me with a penetrating look that appears to demand justice , but for what ? Has she concluded that I epitomize the skulduggery , hypocrisy and deceit of town government ? How do I look to you , Mrs. Wallenby ? Not good , I 'm pretty sure of that . Arthur Gutwillig has papers . You know you are in trouble any tin somebody brings papers to such meeting . Papers mean that a Positio has been taken ; not only taken b fortified , the flag run up , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When Arthur and his page rise , he may be all fire and indignation . Or he may just state a reason able case and get what he wants . never know . Here comes the League of Worn ? en Voters , hands waving in air There is no civic group I respect more . They do their homework prod the government effectively , have a good sense of priorities . But when Myra Leonard starts waving her hand she is going to demand action now , and a government does not take action now . It takes action later or not at all . Temperamentally , I 'm with Myra ? I want action now . But sometimes I wish Myra would hurl a little less indignation . No , cancel that . Give me hell , Myra . It 's good for my system ? and good for The System , too . THE ONLY THING that really gets people riled at the local political level is a threat to their houses . Real panic set in the day the state 's Urban Development Corporation announced it planned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Bedford . Board members found themselves trying to talk reason in a room jammed full of outraged citizens . The people wanted us to drive the rascals out . We thought some moderate- and low- income apartments were needed for people who lived in town , or worked there and had to live elsewhere . We presumed that an acceptable plan could still be found . The yelling went on for four months . We finally compromised . The DC agreed to a good site , reduced the number of units , and gave first priority to Bedford residents , second priority to people who work but do n't live in Bedford . But it was too late . The state Assembly stripped the LTDC of its power to override local zoning laws , and the plan collapsed . Now it is four years later , and we have a local church group ready to sponsor subsidized housing for ' the elderly as part of a private luxury development on the same site . There have been no squawks so far . The private builder says , however , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to one woman , recently moved out of New York City , who made a tearful , disorganized plea that we not ruin the peace she had just achieved . I think she was unreasonable in her fears , but I do n't blame her . The only ones I blame are the elected officials who hypocritically say what frightened people want to hear ; and those citizens who most loudly say you ca n't trust politicians and then most loudly applaud the very politicians who will tell them whatever they want to hear . THERE WILL BE HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE at the meeting denouncing the County 's new garbage-station plan . Nobody wants a garbage station , of course , so there will be nobody for the plan . The ignorant will take up more time than the informed . Five people will have new ideas they want us to agree with instantly . With luck the irrelevant talk will die down , and those who have constructive ideas will eventually get their say . But it goes better than that . True , some people hog the floor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air gets cleared , much information gets exchanged and people leave smiling . So I ask myself a really tough question : Is it worth being a grassroots politician in America today ? Here 's how I see it . If more work is better than less , and more reason better than less , and more honest public discussion better than less , then it has been worth it and I 've accomplished something . As to how I feel about what I 've accomplished , that 's easy : I feel disappointed and proud . That 's politics . @#
