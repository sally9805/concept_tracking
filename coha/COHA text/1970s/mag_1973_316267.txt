ONE of the most-quoted remarks of the ubiquitous Henry Kissinger was that 1973 was to be " the Year of Europe . " Americans may not see it that way , but Europeans certainly do . Not since the turbulent transition from shooting war to cold war 25 years ago has Europe found itself at the center of so many different currents of change . <P> Some of those currents flow from the two superpowers who have guided Europe 's destiny since the end of World War II . With Viet Nam out of the way at last , a measured American recessional resumes with negotiations on trade and troop reductions that may well have a profound-and perhaps traumatic - effect on both Western European prosperity and security . At the same time , the old U.S.European " Atlantic community " is rapidly evolving into a spirited international rivalry . While the U.S. obviously remains vastly stronger , and Western Europe is still far from a unified world power , the new sense of rivalry is real , not only in trade , but in less tangible matters , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> The U.S.S.R. , meanwhile , is seeking to revise its own relationship with Europe . Striking a benign new posture to match their talk of detente , the Russians hope to achieve their longstanding goal of a pivotal role in the affairs of Western Europe-a role that they have not been able to win simply through the presence of 31 divisions in Central and Eastern Europe . <P> The Europeans , for their part , are generating powerful currents of their own . The dissatisfaction of East bloc nations-colonies in the world 's last great empire-with the halting pace of their economic progress was one factor that impelled the Soviets to seek a new accommodation with the West . Perhaps wishfully , many Eastern Europeans now look forward to a period of gradually increased economic and human ties with the prospering West . <P> It is the West , though , that seems likely to make the most out of Europe 's year . The British , after so many years of trying , have not just joined the European Economic Community ; they are shaking it up and acting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " in the words of <P> France 's Jean Monnet , spiritual godfather of the EEC . In a way they have . With the expansion of the Common Market from six to nine members-and , more important , the breaking of the French-German deadlock that paralyzed it through the De Gaulle era-Europe now seems at what Italian Author Altiero Spinelli describes as " the brink of a moment of creative tension .
