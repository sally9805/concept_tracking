In these pages you will find informative articles and delightful fiction . You 'll find fun . You 'll find sentiment . In short , you will rediscover an old , old friend . <P> - Saturday Evening Post editorial <P> Old is not really the operative word for the new Saturday Evening Post , which is back on the nation 's newsstands this week as a $1-a-copy quarterly . Antique is more accurate , right down to the custom re-created headline type used by the Post in the 1930s and ' 40s . In format and much of its content , this is the homey , comfortable , non-controversial old Post of Ben Hibbs , not the later , slicker version which piled up some $500 million in libel suits as a result of its " sophisticated muckraking " and finally perished in 1969 from a combination of advertising atrophy and high-circulation pressure . <P> People pushing 50 will find the new Post almost frighteningly familiar . Artist Norman Rockwell did n't do the cover ( even though he is still active at 77 ) , but he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paint a Post delivery boy . Inside , there is an eight-page salute to Rockwell , together with a slew of the original Post 's oldfashioned , gray " narrative illustrations , " which made it seem as if every scene were taking place in an incipient thunderstorm . Other old standbys abound . There are reprints of Tugboat Annie and Thomas Wolfe . The bylines of Paul Gallico and Ellery Queen are back , and so is that veteran Hollywood doorbell ringer , Pete Martin , with " I Call on Ali McGraw . " William <P> Hazlett Upson celebrates The Return of Alexander Bolts and his continuing correspondence with the brass at the Earthworm Tractor Company . The bust of Post Patriarch Benjamin Franklin is , of course , prominently displayed . <P> Cut-Rate Control . This staggering overdose of nostalgia does not bother Beurt SerVaas , 52 , the editor and publisher whose name is the most unfamiliar thing about the new Post . A blunt , bouncy Indianapolis industrialist who has made a specialty of saving failing companies ( and making millions in the process ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a chemical company , an employment agency , a business college , another small publishing operation-and now the venerable Curtis Publishing Co . ( Post , Holiday , Jack and Jill ) . SerVaas picked up control of the company at cut-rate prices last year from the estate of Cyrus Curtis , reportedly paying less than $200,000 for 17% of the shares . With the Post dead and Holiday dying , Curtis was hardly a hot property . The company was burdened with $20 million in tax claims and another $20 million in back debts . Still , SerVaas saw survival possibilities .
