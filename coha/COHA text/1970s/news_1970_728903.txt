txt 6 Arrested as B otnb Suppliers ; Seize 600 Sticks of Dynamite Agents of the Illinois Bureau of Investigation and Chicago Police last night confiscated 600 sticks of dynamite , a quantity of blasting caps and detonating cord , and arrested six persons in a North Side apartment which the agents said was an outlet for radical groups seeking to buy explosives . The raid on the building at 4122 N. Kenmore Av. climaxed a two-month investigation by the IBI and the Federal Bureau of Investigation . One of those arrested drew a .32 caliber revolver as the police broke thru the door , but he was subdued and disarmed . Not In Radical Group Mitchell Ware , chairman of the IBI and leader of the raid , said the six were not themselves members of a radical organization , but were engaged in what he described as a commercial operation . " They were just in it for the money , " Ware said . " They were more interested in making a profit than in any radical cause . " Ware said the investigation began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the corporation which was to be bombed . The guard had caught an employe stealing , Ware said , but " gave him a break when the employe volunteered information about the explosives . " The investigation led to Tennessee , where a large quantity of dynamite had been stolen from a hardware store several months ago , Ware said . The agents then set up an undercover operation , and , when it was learned that the explosives were to be sold tonight , the raiders moved in . Ware said the six persons , two of whom were arrested at Irving Park and Sheridan Roads , were selling the dynamite for $10 a stick . Six Cases Found The 600 sticks were found in four cases , one in the apartment and three in an automobile parked in front of the building . The six arrested were identified as Garney E. Lester , 26 , who lives at the Kenmore address ; Robert J.
