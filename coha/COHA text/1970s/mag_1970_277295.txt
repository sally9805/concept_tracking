As the sun sinks slowly over the rim of the steering wheel , where is a vacationing family likely to put in for the night ? <P> At the first " vacancy " sign they see , say the executives of Holiday Inns , the nation 's most ubiquitous innkeeper . At the first cheap place they can find , contend the officers of Motel 6 , a chain whose $6-a-person basic rate has inspired competitors across the nation to pare their prices . " At my place , " answers Earl Gagosian , president of a California-based chain of just about the most expensive motels in the country . <P> Lately , more and more people have been staying at Earl 's . In the first half of 1970 , a relatively bad year for the motel industry , profits of Gagosian 's 40 Royal Inns in eleven states have tripled , to $389,000 . Room occupancy is down 7% nationwide , Royal Inns ' is up 6.7% . This month Royal Inns will open four new motels , one a 15-story inn that will be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being built in California , Arizona , Georgia and Florida . <P> Log-Burning Fireplaces . The secret behind the five-year-old empire 's paradoxical success is expensive , self-indulgent luxury . " We want to give the guest something more striking and exciting than he left behind , " Gagosian explains . " The old motels that offer nothing much more than shelter are being wiped out . " <P> At Royal Inns , they can not avoid getting more . Gagosian places his newest motels in the middle of downtown areas - often miles from the main highways , but convenient to theaters and stores . Behind gold-and-white facades are elegantly designed rooms . In addition to free color TV and vibrating bed , Royal Inn rooms typically have white satin bedspreads , deep-pile carpeting , antique-white furniture and a full wall-size mural . Some rooms are equipped with bars , refrigerators and log-burning fireplaces . All Royal Inns have swimming pools , sauna baths and therapy pools at no extra charge . Some , like the year-old Royal Inn-at-the-Wharf in the company 's headquarters town , San Diego , have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , will have a movie theater with free admission for guests . Royal rooms do not come cheap : as much as $20 for a single , $30 for a double , and $250 for the " high roller " suite in Las Vegas . <P> Besides Gagosian 's gimmicks , there are other reasons for the upsurge in luxury motels . In many suburbs the cocktail lounge of the local motel has become an after-hours social center . Vacationing patrons of the nation 's 427,000 campsites often make periodic visits to a motel for a shower and a respite from the rigors of outdoor life . And increasing numbers of Americans , reluctant to fight traffic , spend their vacations or long weekends at a cushy motel right in their own town .
