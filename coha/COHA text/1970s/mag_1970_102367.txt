Until the age of 14 I lived in what now seems the 19th century , in a small county seat of 1,500 people in Northern Michigan . My father was the government agricultural agent in the area , and it was his job to dispense advice to farmers in a hopelessly unfertile countryside of jack pine , scrub oak , cedar swamps and fields . // Part of my father 's job was to run the annual county fair with Francis God-bold , the director of the 4-H ( head , heart , health , hands ) Club , and he loved his work . The fair was always held in late August on three invariably hot and dusty days . There were produce and crafts tents , where prize vegetables were stacked neatly . There were canning , needlework and sewing exhibits , and the inevitable judging of milk cows , beef cattle , calves , pigs , sheep and chickens . // In my youth I took less interest in these than in the small midway , where there were games of chance and a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least one implausibly frightening whirl-and-puke sort of machine . And a freak show , where one paid an extra dime to see a hermaphrodite  --  an experience , I might add , that did n't mar my young farm-bred psyche . // For the adults the most exciting spectacle at the fair was the heavyweight horse pulling contest . The small grandstand would fill early in the afternoon with farmers and their wives talking and shading their eyes with the mimeographed programs . Out in the infield and across the track from the grandstand a dozen teams or so would be standing , their owners since midmorning having gone through the involved process of unloading them from trucks and putting on the harness and " working them out " a bit . I was always out in the infield , too , but I watched the action with no great interest . Horses were simply as common as dogs or hogs to me. // At last the pulling teams would be marched out and people would clap for their favorites . The contest consisted of each team in turn attempting to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A man with a clipboard would mark its progress , weight would be added and contestants eliminated for what I thought was hours and hours until a champion would be proclaimed . // As I have said , none of this struck me as particularly entertaining when I was a boy . Yet now , like many of my generation who reached maturity during the lassitude of the Eisenhower era , I feel lost within the energetic radicalism of the young and so I have come back to horse pulling . I go to horse pulling contests , few as they are , whenever I get a chance . I stand in the infield , take my clumsy pictures and talk to the farmers . The teamsters ' beasts look huge and magnificent to me now . In reverse of the usual childhood memory , they have become grander with time rather than diminishing . // For the insider , the sport of horse pulling has intricacies that remind one of fly-fishing or grouse hunting , subtle and arcane strategies and superstitions that would fail any vaguely scientific test . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very small minority of practitioners . // Of all the breeds of pulling horses , the Belgian , with origins that date back to William the Conqueror 's war-horses , is the strongest and most popular in the heavyweight class . The Percheron is the most frequent breed in the " lightweights , " the cutoff point being a combined weight per team of 3,200 pounds . But the largest team does not necessarily win . Conditioning is a vital factor , as are natural strength , daily workouts and how well the horses pull together as a team . A well-trained lighter team often beats a stronger and heavier one . As with dogs , there is a great variation of size within each breed . At present there is an attempt being made to breed " more light " under Belgian pullers , to sacrifice a bit of their compactness for a rangier horse . // Pulling horses are nearly always geldings or mares for obvious reasons . One scarcely can tell a sexed-up bull elephant to calm down if there 's a female in heat in the area @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greater than that of these huge animals . It has been accurately estimated that a team of championship quality can pull the equivalent of a rolling load of 110 tons or a deadweight stoneboat of around 10,000 pounds . // Nowadays a device called a " hydrometer " mounted on a truck is often used in major contests for absolute accuracy , but such a device would find little favor at the old county fairs . Much of the audience 's pleasure lay in the visual drama of the pig iron being gradually added in the stoneboat as the contest went on . Usually there were many arguments and much stalling . False passes were made at the hitch in a subtle tactic designed to allow the bottom of the boat to cool , thus reducing the friction of heat caused by the previous contestant . // Today , as yesterday , most teams are keyed to start pulling by the sound of the clank of the hitch when the hook drops in , rather than by the shout of the teamster . Two assistants carry the ends of the eveners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teamster seats himself holding the reins tightly ; then with the clank or the shout their flanks lower , and the horses strain forward against the weight , tearing out clots of earth with their hooves . When the 27 ? - foot distance is reached , a whistle is blown . No well-trained audience ever claps until the distance is covered , as the horses associate applause with success and will stop short . // Horse pulling is still an extremely expensive sport , and the prize money so pitifully small as to make it virtually amateur . Top prizes rarely go over $250 . A pulling team which will be in its prime for only about five years can cost anywhere from $400 to $20,000 , and to this initial expense must be added the cost of hauling a team from contest to contest , the feeding of animals that eat four times as much as racehorses and the considerable price of the custom harness . // Like much that our parents believed in , horse pulling as a sport will , I suspect , disappear  --  probably in my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the sport , I 'm sure , will suffer a natural degeneration as organic to our time as the death of jousting was to the Middle Ages . Meanwhile , back at the fair , the audience grows older and sparser . Today the grandstand at a pulling contest , admission to which is free , looks like a retirement colony on holiday . Horse pulling can not compete with DAN 'S HELL ROARING DEVIL DRIVING CAR SMASHERS , the feature attraction of this year 's fair .
