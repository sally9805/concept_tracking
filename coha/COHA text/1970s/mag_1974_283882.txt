ANEURIN BEVAN : A BIOGRAPHY , VOL . II , 1945-1960 by MICHAEL FOOT 692 pages . Atheneum. $13.95 . <P> Aneurin was a 7th century Welsh warrior-bard , and Aneurin Bevan aptly bore his name . Roaring into the House of Commons in 1929 , the original Angry Young Man , he became-second only to his archfoe , Winston Churchill - the most hypnotic orator and contumacious politician of 20th century Britain . One of seven surviving sons of a Monmouthshire miner who died of lung disease , " Nye " Bevan , even in his plummy days as a Buckinghamshire squire and playboy of the West End world , never forgot or forgave the hardscrabble existence eked out by the working folk of his native valleys . His principal monument is Britain 's National Health Service , still the model of womb-to-tomb medical care . <P> False Teeth . As Minister of Health and ( at 47 ) youngest Cabinet member in Britain 's first postwar Labor government , Bevan not only carried the campaign to socialize medicine but charmed the stethoscopes off the doctors with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , delivered in lilting Celtic cadences . In one of several exits and expulsions , he quit the Cabinet in protest against the government 's decision to levy a small fee for patients ' spectacles and dentures . Partly as a result , Labor was turned out of office in 1951 ; the electorate bit the hand that had fed it , with Sevan 's false teeth . <P> Nye recklessly ignored Oscar Wilde 's advice : " A man can not be too careful in his choice of enemies . " In the darkest days of the Hitler war , Bevan accused Churchill of " petrified adolescence . " ( The patrician Prime Minister , in the course of their 26-year feud , called Bevan a " squalid nuisance " and later " Minister of Disease . " ) In one of the worst gaffes of his career , Bevan denounced Conservatives-presumably , all 8,093,858 Britons who had voted the Tory ticket in 1945-as " lower than vermin . " Nor were his own leaders spared Nye 's spiced tongue . He thought of his Prime Minister , Clement Attlee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the humane and thoughtful Hugh Gaitskell , Attlee 's successor as party leader , a " desiccated calculating machine . " Nye was , as Michael Foot amply documents , his own worst enemy-although , as Labor Foreign Minister Ernest Bevin once retorted , " Not while I 'm alive , he ain't. "
