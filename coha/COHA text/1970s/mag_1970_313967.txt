Insert finger , tug and quaff : in those few seconds , the aluminum ring atop a pop-top can of beer or soda fulfills its function and becomes instant junk . Garbage men hate the rings because the sharp edges can cut . So do barefooted hippies and strollers on the beach . So do conservationists , who lament the litter . To at least one man , however , pop-top rings are a source of inspiration and income-and the raw material for a revival of a medieval fashion . <P> In his San Juan workshop , Designer Gonzalo Chavez , 36 , a native New Yorker who calls himself Mr. Terp , has been painstakingly assembling pop-top rings into glittering dresses , vests , stoles , belts , miniskirts and maxiskirts-all resembling the mailed armor worn by warriors of the Middle Ages to ward off sword blows . Collecting the rings from rubbish heaps behind San Juan bars , Chavez files down their rough edges ' and crochets them together with silver thread . It is a slow process . When he began making the pop-tops last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 600-ring vest 20 inches long . Now he can turn out two vests per day . <P> Considering Chavez 's labors , the price of pop-tops is remarkably low . A 600-ring vest costs $60 , a 1,000-ring stole goes for $100 and a 2,800-ring maxicoat sells for $350 . The most recent creation , a picture hat with a raffia band , can be adjusted into shapes that range from a cowboy stetson to a Garbo cloche , and costs $50 . At those prices , the pop-tops have become the sensation among Puerto Rico 's livelier set . <P> The first pop-top garments were almost as stiff as their medieval counterparts . But Chavez has made them much more supple . " They fit like a second skin , " he claims . " As you wear them , they change shape a little and mold themselves to the contours of the body . " Rings differ too . Budweiser 's rings are light and flexible , Miller High Life 's are " soft , " and Pepsi 's provide a heavier , stiffer garment . <P> Although Chavez @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ risked pinches or scratches by wearing pop-tops over their bare skin . " The first topless chick to try a vest , " he says , " caught her right nipple in a ring . I think it looked groovy , but I can recognize the snags. "
