NINETEENTH-CENTURY WRITERS disliked or dreaded science and technology . Edgar Allan Poe , discovering that scientific attitudes could be richly combined with fantasy , created science fiction . Shelley experimented romantically with chemicals , Balzac thought himself a natural historian or social zoologist ; but for the most part science , engineering , technology horrified writers . To mechanical energy and industrial enterprise , mass production , they opposed feeling , passion , " true work , " artisanship , well-made things . They turned to nature , they specialized in the spirit , they valued love and death more than technical enterprise . Writers then preferred , and still do prefer , the primitive , the exotic and the irregular . These romantic attitudes produced masterpieces of literature and painting . They produced also certain cultural platitudes . The platitude of dehumanizing mechanization formed on the one side . Equally platitudinous , the vision of a new age of positive science and of rational miracles , of progress , a progress that made art as obsolete as religion , filled up the other horizon . The platitude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose characters are drug-using noble savages , beautiful , mythical primitives who fish in the waters dammed up by nuclear installations . Now , as power-minded theoreticians see it , the struggle between old art and new technology has ended in the triumph of technology . The following statement , and it is a typical one , is made by Mr. Arthur C. Clarke in a book called Report on Planet Three . " It has often been suggested , " he says , " that art is a compensation for the deficiencies of the real world ; as our knowledge , our power and above all our maturity increase , we will have less and less need for it . If this is true , the ultra-intelligent machine would have no use for it at all . Even if art turns out to be a dead end , there still remains science .... " This statement by a spokesman of the " victorious " party is for several reasons extraordinarily silly . First , it assumes that art belongs to the childhood of mankind , and that science is identical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in weakness and fear . Third , in its happy worship of ultra-intelligent machines , it expresses a marvelous confidence in the ability of such machines to overcome all the deficiencies of the real world . Such optimistic rationalism is charming , in a way . Put it into rhyming verses and it may sound a lot like Edgar A. Guest . Edgar felt about capitalism and self-reliance precisely as Arthur C. Clarke feels about the supertechnological future . They share a certain expansiveness , the intoxication of the win ner , the confidence of the great simplifier . Mr Clarke says in effect , " Do n't worry , dear pals if art is a dead end , we still have science . Pret ty soon we wo n't need Homer and Shakespeare Monteverdi and Mozart . Thinking machines wil give us all the wisdom and joy we want , in ou : maturity . " I have chosen a different sort of theorist to put the question from another angle . Writing in The Atlantic of July 1972 , Mr. Theodore Ros zak takes issue with Robert J. Good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letter to tin magazine , Professor Good , of the party of sci ence and technology , says that it is sad to se4 modern intellectuals " cutting off their own root in rationality . " Mr. Roszak tries to deal genii : with the Professor . He says with a pious tremor " What can one do , even in radical dissent , bu handle with affectionate care so noble and for midable a tradition within our culture eve knowing it is a tragic error and the death o the soul ? " Mr. Roszak goes on , " It is not pri marily science I pit myself against in what write . Rather , the wound I seek to heal is tha of psychic alienation : the invidious segregr tion of humanity from the natural continuum the divorce of visionary energy from intellec and action . What Professor Good disparages a the irrational ... is a grand spectrum of human potentialities . When rationality is cut away frot that spectrum , then the life of Reason become that mad rationality which insists that only win is impersonal and empirical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Believe that and you are not far from tabulating the tragedies of our existence by way of body counts and megadeaths and chemical imbalances within our neural circuitry . " Of course such issues can not be discussed without invoking the most monstrous topic of the day . For ideologists in all fields the political question is always hugely , repulsively , squatting behind a paper screen . But when we have cited the argument that ultra-intelligent technology has no need of art , and the counterargument that creativity is needed to heal psychic alienation and keep us from criminal wars , we have not altogether exhausted our alternatives . There is a third alternative , which has nothing much to do with compensation for the deficiencies of the world or with society 's health . This alternative holds that man is an artist , and that art is a name for something always done by human beings . The technologiml present may be inhospitable to this sort of loing , but art can no more be taken from humancind than faces and hands . The giving of weight : o @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ articular with resonant meanings , can not be Iriven out by the other tendency ? to insist on he finitude of the finite and to divest it of awe and beauty . Is art " childish , " science " mature " ? S THE FILM 2001 , with a sinister computer that speaks in a homosexual voice , a forerunner if the new maturity ? Will this sort of drama eplace Othello , in which an immature husbandmurders his wife ? I call Othello immature because I have been told by a famous progressive psychiatrist that in future ages , with sexual jealousy gone , Othello will be incomprehensible . Scientism dearly loves to speak of the childish past , the grave future . When I hear people invoking the maturity of future generations , I think of a conversation in the Anti-Memoirs between Malraux and a parish priest who joined the Resistance and later died fighting the Germans . Malraux asked this man : " How long have you been hearing confes-sions ? " " About fifteen years . " " What has confession taught you about men ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , people are much more unhappy than one thinks . . . and then ... the fundamental fact is that there 's no such thing as a grown-up person .... " Anyway , romantics hold that it is very dangerous to sanity to deny the child within us , while scientism says that technological progress is about to carry us for the first time into the adult stage . On both sides intellectuals take positions on what art can or can not add to human happiness . In most discussions the accent falls on health , welfare , progress , or politics , or anything but art . About art itself most intellectuals know and care little . Malraux begins his Anti-Memoirs with the wise chaplain of the Maquis . He then goes immediately into the subject of memoirs and confessions and discusses the " theatrical self-image " in autobiography . " Once , " he says , " man was sought in the great deeds of great men ; then he was sought in the secret actions of in- dividuals a change encouraged by the fact that great deeds were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . " Malraux then concludes , " The confessions of the most provocative memorialist seem puerile by comparison with the monsters conjured up by psychoanalytic exploration , even to those who contest its conclusions . The analyst 's couch reveals far more about the secrets of the human heart , and more startlingly , too . We are less astonished by Stavrogin 's confession in Dostoevsky 's The Possessed than by Freud 's Man with the Rats : genius is its only justification . " The genius , I take it , belongs to Dostoevsky . 1 am not quite sure what Malraux means , but I think he is saying that what a clinical psychologist learns about the human heart is far deeper and more curious than anything the greatest novelists can reveal . Perhaps he hints even that the madman is more profoundly creative in his rat-imaginings or grotesque fantasies than the writer , who can only compensate us for the ordinariness of his " vile secrets " or " frightful memories " by the power of his mind ? " genius is his only justification . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far , we can legitimately take Malraux , a novelist , to be saying that in the field of facts the writer is " puerile . " He can not compete in the field of facts with the clinical expert . S 0 NOVELISTS ONCE gave " information " to the J public . But when people now really want to know something , they turn to the expert . Universities and research institutes produce masses of experts , and governments license them . The dazzle of expertise blinds the unsure , the dependent and the wretched . It is not the novelist alone who has lost ground . Expertise has made all opinion shaky , and even powerful men are reluctant to trust their own judgment . In totalitarian countries where facts are suppressed , writers of exceptional courage still tell the truth in the old way ( why was it not a Soviet expert who told the world about the GULag Archipelago ? ) . But in the free world novelists seldom instruct the public in the old way . Artists were great and highly visible monuments in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hugo and its Leo Tolstoy . But Shaw and Wells were the last of these prestigious literary spokesmen . In the postwar period only Bertrand Russell and Jean-Paul Sartre appeared before the world in this role , and even if these two had been more consistent and sensible they would not have affected the public as their greater predecessors had done . The era of the writer as public sage and as dependable informant has ended . A single standard has been set for novelists and for experts ? the fact-standard . The result of this strict accountability has been to narrow the scope of the novel , to make the novelist doubt his own powers and the right of his imagination to range over the entire world . The authority of the imagination has declined . This has had two remarkable results . Earlier in the century certain writers rejected the older novel with its more modest objectives . The Dickens sort of novel ? Great Expectations , say ? was replaced by the more comprehensive novel , nothing less than an esthetic project for encompassing the whole world . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Ulysses do not draw the real world so much as replace it by esthetic fiat . Joyce was , perhaps unintentionally , an esthetic dictator . The century needed a book ? He pro vided one . It was a book that would make other books unnecessary . It had taken about Went ) years to write Ulysses and Finnegans Wake anc it should take just as long to read them . Thi : was one result of the weakening of the authority of writers and of the power of the literary imag ination to command attention overassertive ness . A more recent result has been surrender Writers have capitulated to fact , to events am reportage , to politics and demagogy . Modern ar has tried to create power for itself on arbitrar terms and has also pursued and worshiped pow er in its public forms . Until recent times the artist 's dream-spher was distinctly separate from the practical o mechanical realm of the technician . But in th twentieth century , as Paul Valery recognized , change occurred . " The fabulous , " he wrote i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The manufar ture of machines to work miracles provides a li , ing to thousands of people . But the artist ha had no share in producing these wonders . The are the work of science and capital . The boa geois has invested his money in phantoms an is speculating on the downfall of common sense . ' Yes , technology is the product of science an capital , and of specialization and the divisic of labor . It is a triumph of the accurate poi er of innumerable brains and wills acting i unison to produce a machine or a comrnodit These many wills constitute a fictive supersel astonishingly effective in converting dreams in machines . Literature , by contrast , is product by the single individual , concerns itself wi individuals , and is read by separate person And the single individual ? this unit of vit being . of nerve and brain , which judges knows , is happy or mourns , actually lives at actually dies ? is unfavorably compared wi that fictive supersell , which , acting in unis ( and according to plan , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and other mo ern technological wonders . Glamorous , victo ous technology is sometimes considered to ha discredited all former ideas of the single se Making it new T 0 THEORISTS OF THE NEW , a thing is genuine only if it manifests the new . Valery in the essay " Remarks on Progress , " from which I have just quoted , illustrates this attitude remarkably well . " Men , " he says , " are doubtless developing the habit of considering all knowledge as transitional and every stage of their industry and their relations as provisional . This is new . " And again , " Suppose that the enormous transformation which we are living through and which is changing us continues to develop , finally altering whatever customs are left and making a very different adaptation of our needs to our means ; the new era will soon produce men who are no longer attached to the past by any habit of mind . For them history will be nothing but strange , incomprehensible tales ; there will be nothing in their time that was ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their present . Everything in man that is not purely physiological will be altered , for our ambitions , our politics , our wars , our manners , our arts are now in a phase of a quick change ; they depend more and more on the positive sciences and hence less and less on what used to be . New facts tend to take on the importance that once belonged to tradition and historical facts . " This is the quintessence of the tradition of the new . By attaching itself to technology " newness " achieves a result longed for by those thinkers of the last century who were oppressed by historical consciousness . Karl Marx felt in history the tradition of all the dead generations weighing like a nightmare on the brain of the living . Nietzsche speaks movingly of the tyranny of " it was , " and Joyce 's Stephen Dedalus also " I have been told defines history as a nightmare from which we are trying to awaken . The vision of freedom without conditions ? a state of perfect and lucid consciousness into which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a sort of romance , really , a French intellectual 's paradise . But Valery does not neglect the painful side of this vision . " One of the surest and cruelest effects of progress , " he says , " is to add a further pain to death , a pain increasing of itself as the revolution in customs and ideas becomes more marked and rapid . It is not enough to perish ; one has to become unintelligible , almost ridiculous ; and even a Racine or a Bossuet must take his place alongside those bizarre figures , striped and tattooed , exposed to passing smiles , and somewhat frightening , standing in rows in the galleries and gradually blending with the stuffed specimens of the animal kingdom .... " So , at the height of technological achievement there blazes the menace of obsolescence . The museum , worse than the grave because it humiliates us by making us dodos , waits in judgment on our ambitions and vanities . Of course no one wants to suffer the double doom of obsolescence ? to be dead and also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend and colleague of history . Consciously or not , intellectuals try hard to be what Hegel called Historical Men or World-Historical Individuals , those persons through whom truth operates and who have an insight into the requirement of the time , who divine what is ripe for development , the nascent principle , the next necessary thing . They may denounce the nightmare past , but they have also an immortal craving to be in the line of suc- lichard Mantel 51 cession , and to prove themselves to be historically necessary . It is these people , lovers of the new , who derive from technological progress a special contempt for the obsolete . The enemies of pastness , even though they tell us that we will depend more and more on the positive sciences and hence less and less on what used to be , insofar as they seek the next necessary development , make their own kind of historical judgment . Intellectuals , when they sense the cruel effects of technological progress , try not only to escape oblivion themselves by association with the next necessary thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those writers who fail to recognize that the human condition has been , or will be , completely transformed by science and the revolution of customs and who , in the old-fashioned solitude of old-fashioned rooms , continue to consider the destinies of old-fashioned individuals and follow their old-fashioned trade ( a home industry of the seventeenth century ) , unaware that the World Spirit has abandoned them just as it abandoned the walled city and the crossbow. piece of the same paper , and then goes out to the funeral of Paddy Dignam . Matters could not be more real . Now realism in literature is a convention , and this convention postulates that human beings are not what everyone for long centuries conceived them to be . They are something different , and they live in a disenchanted world that exists for no particular purpose that science can show . Still people continue to try to lead a human life . And this is rather quaint because man is not the comparatively distinguished creature he thinks himself to be . In the new view be is more wretched , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's fullest account of human life ? within this realistic convention . As he sees it , the material world is now entirely human . Everything about us ? clothing . beds , tableware , streets , privies , newspapers , language , thought ? is man-made . All artifacts orig. inate in thought . They are thoughts practically extended into matter . Nature governs us phys ? iologically and the unconscious is still its strong . hold , but the external world consists entirely of human inventions and projections . Nature has been beaten out of it . Amongst these pow ers , instinct in the depths , language in the mid die , artifacts outside , the life of Ulysses-Bloon is comically divided . Joyce is the complete naturalist , the artist zoologist , the poet-ethnographer . His account of Bloom 's life includes everything . Every think seems to demand inclusion . No trivialities or ab surdities are omitted . Old bourgeois reticence5 are overrun zigzag . For what , after all , is au important information ? No one knows . Any thing at all may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that tIn unconscious did not distinguish between majo and minor matters as conscious judgment did and that the junk of the psyche had the deepes things to tell us . Joyce is the greatest psychic junkman of our age , after Freud . For the las of the facts may be the first . Thus we know the lining of Bloom 's hat , and the contents of hi pockets , we know his genitals and his guts , am we are thoroughly familiar with Molly , too , hov she feels before her period , and how she smells With so much knowledge we are close ti chaos . For what are we to do with such a bus den of information ? Ulysses is a comedy of in formation . Leopold Bloom lies submerged in a ) ocean of random facts ? textbook tags , items o news , bits of history , slogans , cliches , ditties operatic arias , saws and jokes , scraps of pof ular science , and a great volume of supersti tions , fantasies , technical accounts of the Dubli : water supply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The debris a learning , epic , faith and enlightenment you over him . In this circumambient ocean , h seems at times to dwell like a coelenterate or a sponge . The man-made world begins , like the physical world , to suggest infinity . The mind is endangered by the multitude of accounts that it can give of all matters . It is threatened with inanity or disintegration . William James believed that not even the toughest of tough minds could bear to know everything that happened in a single city on a given day . No one could endure it . It is probably one of the functions of the nervous system to screen us and to preserve us from disintegrating in the sea of facts . We ourselves , however , seek out this danger , for the Faustian dream of omniscience lives on . At all events , Bloom 's mind is assailed and drowned by facts . He appears to acknowledge a sort of responsibility to these facts , and he goes about Dublin doing his facts . This suggests that our scientific , industrial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own and that it borrows our minds and souls for its own purposes . In this sense civilization lives upon Bloom . His mind is overcome by its data . He is the bearer , the servant , the slave of involuntary or random cognitions . But he is also the poet of distractions . If Bloom were only Everyman , nothing but the sort of person realism describes as " ordinary , " he would not be the Bloom we adore . The truth is that Bloom is a wit , a comedian . In the depths of his passivity , Bloom resists . He is said in Dublin to be " something of an artist . " To be an artist in the ocean of modern information is certainly no blessing . The artist has less power to resist the facts than other men . He is obliged to note the particulars . One may even say that he is condemned to see them . In the cemetery Bloom ca n't help seeing the gravedigger 's spade and noting that it is " blueglancing . " He is receptively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The fact that he is " something of an artist " aggravates the problems of information . He seeks relief in digression , in evasion and in wit . Why is the diversity of data so dazzling and powerful in Ulysses ? The data are potent because the story itself is negligible . Ulysses , as Gertrude Stein once said , is not a " what-happens-next ? " sort of book . A " what-happensnext ? " story would , like a nervous system , screen out distractions and maintain order . Who 's got the story ? T IS THE ABSENCE of a story that makes Bloom what he is . By injecting him with purpose a . tory would put the world in order and con:entrate his mind . But perhaps Bloom 's mind s better not ordered . Why should he , the son ) f a suicide , the father who mourns a dead : hill , a cuckold and a Jew in Catholic Dublindesire moral and intellectual clarity ? If his mind were clear he would be another man entirely . No , the plan of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among the phenomena and moves vaguely toward resolution . Oh , he gets there , but there is a region , not a point . At one of the low hours of his day he thinks , " Nothing is anything . " He feels his servitude to the conditions of being . When there is no story those conditions have it all their own way and one is delivered to despair . The artifact civilization , Joyce seems to tell us , atrophies the will . The stream of consciousness flows full and wide through the will-less . The romantic heroes of powerful will , the Rastignacs and the Raskolnikovs are gone . The truth of the present day is in the little Blooms whose wills offer no hindrance to the stream of consciousness . And his stream has no stories . It has themes . Bloom does not , however , disintegrate in this thematic flow . Total examination of a single human being discloses a most extraordinary entity , a comic subject , a Bloom . But the burden of being a Bloom is nevertheless frightful . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see the Bloom problem . Long passages of Ulysses are bound together by slurs ( in the musical sense ) of ambiguous laughter . It does , however , appear that Joyce expected the individual who has gone beyond the fictions and postures of " individuality " ( romantic will , et cetera ) to be sustained by suprapersonal powers of myth . Myth , rising from the unconscious , is superior to mere " story , " but myth will not come near while ordinary trivial ideas of self remain . The powers of myth can be raised up only when the well-known pretensions of selfhood are surrendered . Therefore consciousness must abase itself , and every hidden thing must be exhumed . Hence Bloom 's moments in the privy , his corpse fantasies at Paddy 's funeral , his ejaculation as he watches crippled Gerty , his masochistic hallucinations in Nighttown . The old dignities must take a terrific heating in this new version of " the last shall be first . " W HAT YOU FEEL READING Ulysses today is the extent to which a modern society imposes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the past , knew little about the great world now stands in the middle of it . At least he thinks he does as reader , hearer , citizen , voter , and judge of all public questions . His imagination has been formed to make him think himself in the center . The all-important story appears to belong to society itself . Real interest is monopolized by collective achievements and public events , by the fate of mankind , by a kind of " politics . " The voluminous Sunday Times is put into our hands together with Time and Newsweek , while images from television flash 53 behind us . This is the week 's record of everything of substance relating to the human species . It is about us , our hope for survival , our common destiny . Is it , now ? Does this really speak to my condition ? Is this mankind , is it me , heart , soul and destiny ? No , the nominally central individual studying the record does not feel central . On the contrary he feels peculiarly contentless in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proper story . A proper story would express his intuition that his own existence is peculiarly significant . The sense that his existence is significant haunts him . But he can prove nothing . And the business of art is with this sense , precisely . The modern masters one of the principal supports of this social class . Gide 's The Counterfeiters is a cultural product as well as a novel ; The Red and the Black is no such thing . The Magic Mountain belongs to Intellectual History , a category that does not exist for that excellent book Little Dorrit . It never occurred to Dickens to run over into cultural criticism or to be Carlyle and Mill as well as Charles Dickens . But in the twentieth century writers are often educated men as well as creators , and in some the education prevails over the creation . There are reasons for this . A burden of " understanding " has been laid upon us by this revolutionary century . What I am trying to indicate is that cultural style is not to be confused with genuine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while cultural style seems to have hun dreds of thousands . T HOUGH THE SUN SHINES SWEETLY , the mod- ern mind knows that there are devilish processes of nuclear fusion and staggering explosions in the heavens . So as mild Bloom goes down the streets we are aware of a formidable intellect that follows him as he buys a cake of soap . The modernists are learned intellectuals ? Viconians like Joyce , Freudians , Marxians , Bergsonians , et cetera . A technological society produces mental artists and an intensely intellectual literary culture . " Most modern masterpieces are critical masterpieces , " writes Harold Rosenberg . " Joyce 's writing is a criticism of literature , Pound 's poetry a criticism of poetry , Picasso 's painting a criticism of painting . Modern art also criticizes the existing culture . " Rosenberg finds merit in this . " One keeps hoping that the decline in excellence of people and things is an effect of transition . All we have on the positive side is the individual 's capacity for resistance . Resistance and criticism . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things ( the last an effect of technology ) is an effect of transition shows Mr. Rosenberg 's heart to be in the right place . But the emphasis on criticism shows something else , namely a claim for intellectual priority . Art is something that must satisfy the requirements of intellectuals . It must interest intellectuals by being , in the right sense , critical of the existing culture . The fact is that modern art has tried very hard to please its intellectual judges . Intellectual judgment in the twentieth century resembles aristocratic taste in the eighteenth ? in the sense , only , that artists in both centuries acknowledge its importance . Art in the twentieth century is more greatly appreciated if it is directly translatable into intellectual interests , if it stimulates ideas , if it lends itself to discourse . Because intellectuals do not like to suspend themselves in works of the imagination . They prefer to talk . Thus they make theology and philosophy out of literature . They make psychological theory . They make politics . Art is NE OF THE PROBLEMS of literature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who preside over literary problems the spe cialists , scholars , historians , and teachers . Mod ern writers , themselves more " intellectual ' than writers were a century ago , now face public formed , educated and dominated by pro lessors , " humanists " and " antihumanists , " psychologists and psychotherapists , by the pro fessional custodians of culture and by ideol ogists and shapers of the future . This critica public has a thousand important ( i.e. , politica and social ) questions to answer . It is irritabf fastidious . It asks , " To whom should we listen Who , if anyone , can be read ? What is , or cai be , really interesting to a modern cultivated in telligence ? " Such questions can only be ar swered with sadness and sighs . To prove that am not exaggerating , I shall quote briefly fror an essay by Lionel Trilling , " Authenticit and the Modern Unconscious . " In this essa Professor Trilling argues that in this day an age , things being what they are , novels can n @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is the exceptional novelist toda who would say of himself , as Henry James die that he ' loved the story as story , ' by whit James meant the story apart from any over ideational intention it might have , simply a like any primitive tale , it brings into play wlu he called ' the blessed faculty of wonder . ' A ready in James 's day , narration as a means b which the reader was held spellbound , as ti old phrase put it , had come under suspiciol And the dubiety grew to the point where Waltt Benjamin could say some three decades ago th the art of story-telling was moribund . " Here one cries out , " Waitl Who is this Be jamin ? Why does it matter what he said ? " B intellectuals do refer to one another to strengt en their arguments . It turns out that the la Walter Benjamin objected to storytellers because they had " an orientation toward practical interests . " Stories , Trilling quotes Benjamin as saying , are likely to contain " something useful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " begins to show itself . Modern literary culture , which prides itself on being radical , dissenting. free , has its own orthodoxy . Do n't we know how it views the Bourgeois , the Child , the Family , Technology , the Artist , the Useful ? We do indeed . The idea of usefulness , Baudelaire said , nauseated him ? and there , in Baudelaire , is the foundation of your orthodoxy . Storytellers , Benjamin objects , have " counsel to give " and this giving of counsel has " an old-fashioned ring . " Professor Trilling then says that it is " inauthentic for the present time ? there is something inauthentic for our time in being held spellbound , momentarily forgetful of oneself , concerned with the fate of a person who is not oneself .... By what right , we are now inclined to ask , does the narrator exercise authority over that other person , let alone over the reader : by what right does he arrange the confusion between the two and presume to have counsel to ; ive ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our time in being held spellJound , then Homer and Dostoevsky , whose , vorks hold us spellbound , are inauthentic .

Proles- , or Trilling 's point seems to be that the modern ondition is killing certain human activities arts ) once highly valued . For an authentic nodern man , living in a modern technological society , naive self-surrender is impossible . Ap , arently the question is partly one of authorty . " By what right does the narrator " presume o invade our minds , deliberately confuse us , nd give counsel ? I do n't see what good it does o make a political question of this . By what ight do our parents conceive us , or we our chilren ? By what right does society teach us a inguage or give us a culture ? If authentic man ad no words he would be unable to express is longing to be so virginal . But this I realize is not quite fair . Professor ' riding wishes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ descend into the depths of the nconscious in search of truth and maturity , ecoming , if he can think hard and face the unonscious fearlessly , one of Aristotle 's Greatouled Men . Thus Professor Trilling seems to gree with Malraux 's priest in the Resistance at there is no such thing as a grown-up perm . His position is also close to that of Mr. rthur C. Clarke , who suggests that art is a cornmsation for the deficiencies of the real world id that " as our knowledge , our power andabove all our maturity increase , we will have less and less need for it .... the ultra-intelligent machine would have no use for it at all . " S O PROFESSOR TRILLING , moving toward " sci-entificc truth , " declares that we can no longer be held spellbound and Mr. Clarke tells us that we can be redeemed by technology from the childish need for art . And art itself is not casting glorious new works upon the world ? although if it were the experts might not know it . But perhaps a modest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have always told stories to one another . By what right have they done this , and on what authority ? Well , on none , really . They have simply obeyed the impulse to tell and the desire to hear . Science and technology are not likely to remove this narrating and spellbinding oddity from the soul . The present age has a certain rationalizing restlessness or cognitive irritability : a participatory delirium that makes the arresting powers of any work of art intolerable . The desire to read is itself spoiled by " cultural interests " and by a frantic desire to associate everything with something else and to convert works of art into subjects of discourse . Technology has weakened certain points of spiritual rest . Wedding guests and ancient mariners both are deafened by the terrific blaring of the technological band . In a charming and strange book , the prerevolutionary Russian writer V. V. Rozanov argues against repressive puritanism in words that can be applied more widely and are relevant to the subject . He writes : A million years passed before my soul was let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can l say to her , " Do n't forget yourself , darling , but enjoy yourself in a responsible fashion .

" For my life is my day , and it is my day , and not Socrates ' or Spinoza 's . Thus to the queen , or tramp who is his soul Rozanov speaks with an erotic-religious aim of some sort . But we can adapt this to our own purpose , saying , " A million years passed before my soul was let out into the technological world . That world was filled with ultra-intelligent machines , but the soul after all was a soul , and it had waited a million years for its turn and did not intend to be cheated of its birthright by a lot of mere gimmicks . It had come from the far reaches of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by these inventions . "
