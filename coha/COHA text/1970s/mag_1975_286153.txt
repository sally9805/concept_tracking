No writer in the U.S. Catholic press has been a more sulfurous advocate of rightist views in recent years than Jesuit Priest Dan Lyons , 55 . He fought the cold war long after most Catholics had thawed . He attacked modernists , the Berrigan brothers and the liberal Catholic press . In 1970 , when liberals were agitating for the right to marry and remain priests , he wrote : " The Church decided long ago that the celibate priest is more like Christ . " <P> Last week Lyons ' voice was suddenly silent . He had turned in his last columns to the National Catholic Register and Twin Circle ( combined weekly circulation : 162,000 ) , left his Manhattan office and headed west . Days later , he walked into the Portland , Ore. , headquarters of his Jesuit superior , the Very Rev. Kenneth Galbraith , and stunned him by asking for a leave of absence , with the intention of ultimately seeking release from his priestly vows . After all the dropouts in recent years , " I thought I was through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was surprised . " <P> Lyons gave no public explanation , but Lyons-watchers immediately assumed that he wants to leave the priesthood in order to marry winsome Irish Singer Mary Cooney , 24 . Lyons , who had flown back to New York , flatly denied to TIME that Cooney played any role in his decision . Lyons met Cooney two years ago and since then has acted part-time as her manager . A few months ago Twin Circle ran a laudatory feature story about her talents . <P> Several years ago , Lyons told his biographer , " It would be impossible for me to leave the priesthood . " And his defection would undoubtedly come as a shock to his loyally pious fans , many of whom presumably associate priestly dropouts with apostasy . Unlike many liberals , however , Lyons is following the proper rules for leaving . In his heyday , Lyons was a formidable figure in conservative Catholicism . With Schick Razor King Patrick Frawley , Lyons started Twin Circle in 1967 , served as its editor and got Frawley to take over the Register @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buy the 77-year-old priests ' monthly , Homiletic and Pastoral Review . <P> Editor Stung . One Jesuit stung by Lyons ' defection is a fellow conservative , Father Kenneth Baker , editor of the Homiletic . Last week confusion reigned as Baker quit and killed the October edition just as it was about to go to press . Said he : " With his going off and leaving like this , it does n't make any sense for me to continue . " <P> Somewhat belatedly , Baker realized that Lyons was the sole owner of the Homiletic , but Lyons , without consulting Baker , says he has turned control of the magazine over to Galbraith . At week 's end Galbraith was flying to New York City to confer with both Lyons and Baker . Legally , the Homiletic had belonged to a Lyons-owned enterprise called Catholic Polls , Inc . One purpose of the organization : to poll the Catholic clergy and prove Lyons ' contention that a majority oppose permitting priests to marry .             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
