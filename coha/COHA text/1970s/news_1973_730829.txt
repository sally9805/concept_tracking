txt There is little that is imposing about A. Alan Post . Mr. Post , 58 years old , is a mild-mannered , bespectacled economics expert who wears conservative business suits and pursues a low-key approach to his job . He spends much of his day in an unimpressive office in a corner of the State Capitol , poring over the often-dry statistics of state finance . No massive spending programs are at his beck and call , and he has almost no formal powers . Yet in Mr. Post 's nearly 25 years in Sacramento , few individuals have exerted a greater influence on the direction and quality of California 's government . As LegThlative Analyst , the state legislature 's chief budget adviser , Mr. Post has become a sort of super watchdog who studies all areas where the state spends money . An example of his influence : In 1971 the California Supreme Court held that the publicschool financing : vs-tern , based largely on local property taxes , was unconstitutional because it discriminated against ' the poor . The ruling extensively cited a report @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of schools . " By the amount the report was cited , it obviously played a considerable role in the decision , " says John of the Western Center on Law and Poverty , who was an attorney for the plaintiff in the school case . " It was an excellent factual description , and Mr. Post 's reputation gave it considerable weight . " ( In a similar Texas case , the U.S. Supreme Court recently ruled the opposite . ) Such factual presentations have become a trademark of this soft-spoken - man whcisi cordial manner seems - more-  suited to a college lecture hall than the often rough-and-tumble world of California politics . Now in 45 States The position of Legislative Analyst was created in 1941 and was the first such office in any state government . Under Mr. Post 's guidance ? he succeeded the position 's first occupant in 1949 ? the office has grown steadily , and today it consists of 44 budget analysts . Since its creation , more and more State legislatures have turned to men like Alan Post for aid in untangling the complex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , compared with 28 a decade ago , says Brevard Crihfield , executive director of the Council of State Governments . " But none of these has yet matched Alan 's office in the scope of their operations , " Mr. Crihfield says . " He , is still rather unique . " Recently Congress has been considering a fiscal-review office . " And the California office is often cited as the sort of thing we should be doing , " says George Krumbhaar , minority counsel to the Joint Economic Committee . Mr. Post 's office does analyses and makes recommendations not only on the governor 's proposed budget but also on any other state spending proposals . It also monitors the progress of programs using state funds . Its reports are issued both on its own initiative and at the request of lawmakers . " He Is n't the Legislature " Legislators are quick to point out that while Mr. Post 's opinions often influence their votes , his advice is n't always followed . " Alan Post is extremely persuasive and an outstanding technician , " Sen. Donald @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his battles by a long shot . He is n't the legislature ; he merely makes recommendations to us . " His penchant for consistently advising cuts in cherished programs has angered a string of governors . ( Such a yen for frugality may have originated in his college days . He recalls that lack of money once forced him to live for six months on a daily diet whose main ingredients , after an adequate breakfast , were an ice cream cone for lunch and , for dinner , two pieces of bread , a slice of cheese and a banana , all topped off by a cup of hot water . ) But while he concedes that his office 's main influence " has been negative in the sense of cutting down programs rather than in starting new ones , " he denies he is nothing but an ax-wielder . " We want to get the full value for each dollar , " he explains , " and sometimes this means we have to spend more in a certain area , or find ways of spending the money better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gov . Ronald Reagan , has complained about Mr. Post 's opposition to cuts . After Mr. Post attacked one Reagan proposal , the governor was quoted as remarking : " Sometimes I think Mr. Post 's staff is more energetic than it is efficient . " Lately , Gov . Reagan and Mr. Post have been clashing over the governor 's plan for a state constitutional amendment limiting the level of state taxation . Some legislators are sensitive about the stature Mr. Post has built up with the public as well as with lawmakers . Randolph Collier , chairman of the senate finance committee , complains , " Each year Mr. Post makes pronouncements on state problems and these get out to the public before the legislature has a chance to act oft them . Sometimes we get stuck with doing what Mr. Poet recommends because of the public pressure that builds up . " While Mr. Post adheres to what he calls " an objective and unimpassioned " manner in his work with the legislative , he clearly relishes the stature that he and his $37,000-a-year position have gained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he says . " I saw a chance to carve out an area of influence with new functions , and it has worked out . We are an effective arm of a legislature that has an extraordinarily important role in public life . " Though Mr. Post lavishes praise upon his staff , most Sacramento observers attribute the office 's success largely to Mr. Post 's talents . They say he combines a brilliant technical mind ( he has a master 's degree in economics from Princeton University ) with steady dedication to nonpartisanship . Mr. Post says he avoids social contact with politicians or lobbyists . And several years ago , he says , he even changed his voting registration from Republican to independent " so I could n't be charged with doing things for political reasons . " Despite his disdain for more bellicose rhetoric . the legislative analyst has often found himself the center of some hot public controversies . A recent study by his office criticizing train-safety measures in the new billion-dollar Bay Area Rapid Transit System brought wide public attention to the problems plaguing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investigation by the California Public Utilities Commission and prompted James Mills , president pro tempore of the state senate , to call , unsuccessfully , for dismissal cf the engineering firm doing the consulting work on the safety controls . After Reagan Since Gov . Reagan was elected in 1966 , Mr. Post has often found himself in the unfamiliar role of advocating more spending . In his first budget , Gov . Reagan proposed a 10% cut in all state departments and programs . Mr. Post expressed strong opposition . For the first time , he recommended significant increases in a governor 's budget , increases totaling $400 million over Mr. Reagan 's proposal of nearly $3 billion . ( The governor later took back many of his proposed cuts . ) Almost every year since then , Mr. Post has clashed with the Reagan administration on fund proposals , mostly in education , welfare and health care . Ironically , Mr. Reagan once asked Mr. Post to be his budget adviser . Governors and legislators alike have found Mr. Post 's support most useful  --  and in some cases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A major reason for this , many observers say , is that the legislature usually believes Mr. Post 's information . Last year , for example , Mr. Post forecast that the state 's revenues would be about $50 million higher that the $5.8-billion estimate from Gov . Reagan 's finance department . " Basically , though , both houses passed budgets on the basis of Post 's predictions , " says Roy Bell , the finance department 's assistant director . " When final figures came in , it turned out his projections were a lot closer than ours . " However . Mr Post 's office recently published a long analysis saying that some of the governor 's figures were based on " misleading and highly inflated assumptions " The report says that Californians spend about 33 cents of every income dollar on taxes , not 44 , and that increases of the magnitude envisioned by Gov . Reagan probably wo n't occur . The governor 's plan , says Mr. Post , will make increases in local taxes " almost inevitable . " Mr Post also argues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1974-75 under the governor 's plan unless already-scheduled spending is cut back . Just an Employe - Mr Reagan replies : " Mr Post seems to has e been in the last few years less objective and a little more beholden to those who are in charge of the majority of the legislature . " The assembly has a Democratic majority . The senate , after a Republican victory in a special election , is divided 20-20 . As an employe of the legislature who can be fired .. it any time , Mr. Post says he has often had to walk a fine line in deciding how far to push his recommendations . He says that all work going can of his office must come across his desk for final approval because " ni the end it 's going to be up to me to present it and defend it to the legislature " Even such tight control has n't always kept Mr. Post out of trouble , observers say . " When Jess Unruh was strong In the assembly ( he was speaker in the ** I thought Alan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says a longtime associate of Mr. Post 's . " For a couple of years he had to be extra careful and underplay some things on particularly partisan affairs . " This source says that while Mr. Pout is - politically astute , " he has run afoul of different legislators over the years because " he is so honest he probably does n't hold back on recommendations all the times he should . " Most observers nevertheless agree that there is little danger Mr. Post will be seriously challenged as long as he wants to keep his job . What happens to the office after Mr. Post leaves , though , is another question . Mr. Post says he would like to retire in " four or fie years " to his home here , which he and his wife designed and built . He hopes then to devote more time to his painting , a skill he already practices with enough proficiency to have periodic showings in art galleries . However , Mr. Post says he would consider staying longer if he thought that doing so would protect the office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least one other reason Mr. Post might consider staying longer . " In his own way , " this source says , " Alan Post likes power , and in that job he has always been sitting right next to the seat of power . " Tax Plan Stirs Clash The governor now is pushing fora state constitutional amendment limiting the level of state taxation to 8.75%  --  the current level ? at first and to 7.15% eventually , in stages over 15 years . The limit could be exceeded only if twothirds of the legislature and the governor approved exceeding it and if a majority of the voters at the next election concurred . Mr. Reagan has argued that the proposal is necessary because Californians now pay 44 cents of every income dollar in federal , state and local taxes . Within 15 years , he says , the figure will rise to 54 cents if action is n't taken .
