Touring Europe with youngsters can be very much like running a herd of piglets through a china shop : catastrophe may lurk on every side , and there always seems to be an enormous bill waiting at the end . But it need not be that way , according to Leila Hadley , whose Fielding 's Guide to Traveling with Children in Europe* has just begun to appear in bookstores . " Traveling with children , " says Author Hadley , " can be as easy and inexpensive-and far more rewarding-than traveling without them . " And , she adds , " It is certainly infinitely preferable to not traveling at all . " <P> To help make the trip even more rewarding , Mrs. Hadley has updated and supplemented the original version of her guide , published in 1963 . Among the new findings , for example , are department stores in Switzerland that offer nurseries where a mother can leave the children while she shops . A typical Hadley tidbit : " Your 5-10s might prefer the whoop-de-doo Jelmoli 's in Zurich , " which offers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a marionette show , a carrousel ride . She has also discovered that there are several new French hotels where children can be left on their own . These hotels are " dedicated to reliable loving care for a day , night , week or longer . " One is the Botel near Paris , " which looks like a dollhouse chteau " and has playground equipment , a pony stable , a nurse and young governesses . <P> Still more valuable to parents , however , is the staple information on how to find baby food , baby sitters , juvenile friends and pen pals , or how to turn out pediatricians at unlikely hours of the night : " If your three-year-old munches Daddy 's deodorant stick , the Anti-Poison Center of Brussels will find the antidote and give you advice before the doctor comes . " There are practical warnings against Spain 's paper diapers ( they disintegrate ) and Scotland 's tasteless attempts at American food . There is even advice on the inevitable problem of finding a bathroom for a child caught short . " With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " reports Author Hadley , " it 's the field , the bush , the woods . No one seems to get very uptight . " <P> The author 's material is drawn largely from her own travel observations , which began in 1949 when she and her first child ( a son , then aged four ) set off for Europe . Since then , she and her son , plus three children born later , have visited 37 countries , 18 of them in Europe . Along the way she did encounter a few perils , however , which she reveals in the new guide . One was in Amsterdam , where " ladies of the night are illuminated in red neon in ground-floor showcases in many narrow streets . I do n't quite know how you explain this to children . " She suggests , hopefully , that the children may not notice , then adds , " If they do , I hope this will serve as a cautionary note to preserve your cool .
