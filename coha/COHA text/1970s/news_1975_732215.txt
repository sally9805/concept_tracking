txt Letters to the Editor Letters to the Editor Of New York City and the President To the Editor : Surely , as Joseph H. Crown points out ( letter Nov. 9 ) and Seymour Melman before him ( Op-Ed Nov. 3 ) , Federal policies  --  military , welfare , fiscal  --  have all had their impact in bringing on New York City 's financial debacle . Even Mayor Lindsay understood that aspect of the problem , and not by hindsight . His repeated charge that the Government was bleeding the cities in order to wage war on Vietnam is one of the things that endeared him to hard-hat patriots . And when Lindsay , early in his first administration , sought to stand up to the garbage men in their biennial ripoff , it was our Republican Governor attempting to establish liberal credentials who pulled the rug out from under him . Too many commentators ignore the contribution to the problem of the union moguls who own the Democratic Party in the City of New York . Certainly over a quarter-century of rent control with its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ base and all prospect of the city bootstrapping itself out of the morass . New Yorkers have no one but themselves to blame for this aspect of the problem , which will Nuclear-Waste Control : Our Moral Obligation To the Editor : A recent editorial ( Oct. 29 ) referred to the current status of the reprocessing of spent fuel elements from nuclear reactors . It called for multinational nuclear fuel centers in which the spent fuel elements could be stored " for possible future use , if reprocessing ever becomes safe and commercially feasible . " I wish to point out that reprocessing should not be viewed from the angle of commercial feasibility but should rather be considered mainly as our moral obligation toward future generations . By recovering 99 percent of the plutonium from the spent fuel during the reprocessing , which is technically feasible , and then burning it in reactors , we decrease the nuclear waste 's toxicity about a hundred times . ( To be precise , this statement is strictly true for inhalation of the waste . As far as oral intake is concerned , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fission products , predominantly the isotope strontium-90 . After 400 years , however , when this isotope has decayed , the toxicity for oral intake will also be governed by the plutonium and its daughters , so that the above-mentioned factor of 100 is correct for this form of intake only after that time ? for the following hundreds of thousands of years . ) Since the seriousness of the health risks posed by the nuclear waste is sufficiently well known , it follows that a hundredfold reduction of this risk should be regarded as our moral duty . Hence , reprocessing the spent fuel elements should be considered as an integral part of the nuclear fuel cycle , and one for which the present producers of nuclear energy should be held responsible , regardless of the costs involved . One can go one step further and ask : May we keep producing nuclear energy , and ever expand the generating capacity in our own country and abroad , as long as we do not have the tail end of the nuclear fuel cycle firmly under control ? ROBERT 0 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take massive Federal assistance and a generation at least to correct . For the Federal Government to step in now with a bail-out must infect the Federal credit with the very germ of improvidence that has destroyed the city . To cancel executory contracts and to reorganize indebtedness is the only feasible first step ; this is bankruptcy , whatever the politicians decide to call it in order to save face . Gerald Ford seems to be the only doctor with the stature and the determination to make us swallow that pill . MALCOLM MONROE White Plains , Nov. 9 , 1975 ? To the Editor : It is sad that as we approach our 200th year we clearly recognize our system of government to be hopelessly inadequate and outmoded to deal with the urgent needs of our present society . The Bicentennial finds us saddled , apparently legally , with an unelected President who chooses to spend that year principally as a campaigner but who , as President , has the staggering power to bankrupt the country 's greatest city because he considers it politically expedient . ROBERTA SCHNEIDERMAN New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Towers To the Editor : I found Stephen S. Berglas ' Nov. 3 letter not only to be repugnant but also racist . As a member of a minority group , a worker and a taxpayer , I deeply resent Mr. Berglas ' lack of intelligence and understanding . How can he bemoan the fact that the Government will subsidize Taino Towers when many of the luxurious buildings in Manhattan alone are already subsidized by the Government ? Taino Towers was intended for those of us who are hard-working taxpayers , who because of our nationality or color are not allowed to move next door to people such as Mr. Berglas . This is something Mr. Berglas can never understand because he is so secure in his white ivory tower . A monthly rent of $113.28 may seem small , but when a person earns only $80 to $90 per week , this becomes a large amount of money . I , for once , am truly happy that the taxes which are taken from my paycheck are finally being used in my own backyard . YOLANDA Rios COLON New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shifts To the Editor : For those who agree with President Ford that the financial difficulties of the City of New York are of its own making and in no way traceable to policies of the Federal Government , an examination of the record just in the matter of national defense will illustrate the error of that position . In Brooklyn alone , we have suffered the loss of the New York Naval Shipyard with its 20,000 jobs , the closing of the Brooklyn Army Terminal and the loss of its Military Traffic Management and Terminal Services , the veritable decommissioning of Fort Hamilton and the transfer of the U.S. Naval Laboratory . The functions performed at these installations have not been abolished . In most instances they are being performed in other parts of the nation . Note the large expenditures for naval ship construction and maintenance being made in the State of Mississippi . These transfers of employment-generating facilities are not militarily strategic . They are intensely political . The trend to favor Southern and Western communities at the economic expense of our own can be detected in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $800 million to twelve Southern states , $448 million to three Pacific states and only $54 million to the nine Northeastern states . Add this discrimination to the inequity of the welfare burden thrust upon this city by the Federal Government , and the real reasons for our fiscal predicament become obvious . SEBASTIAN LEONE President , Borough of Brooklyn Brooklyn , Nov. 10 , 1975 ? The View From Nebraska To the Editor : In her eloquent impeachment of New York for low crimes and slovenly demeanor ( Op-Ed Nov. 6 ) , Mrs. Marian Lenzen of Nebraska seems to have mislaid , during her eyeball-to-eyeball confrontation , 47 other states , the Secretary of Agriculture , several Secretaries of the Interior , Texas , the Reclamation Act of 1902 and the fact that the University of Idaho is located in Moscow . MARCUS A. GOLDMAN Brooklyn , Nov. 6 , 1975 ? To the Editor : Hurrah for Marian Lenzen ! Her OpEd article ( Nov. 6 ) presents a very strong argument why New York City should not go " down the drain . " How else but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her views on wheat prices , big and little farmers , grain deals to Russia , et al. ? Put away the Sani-Flush , Marian . You need us as much as we need you . ANDREW E. BERESKY New York , Nov. 6 , 1975 ? Nassau County Preference To the Editor : In reference to your editorial comments of Nov. 6 , you seem to have overlooked that the voters have just selected the form of government they want to have in Nassau County . This was the will of the people of Nassau , and we do n't need The Times to tell us that it is all wrong . I suggest that you solve the city 's political and financial problems before you tell us what we did wrong here in Nassau County . WILLIAM J. VINCENT Glen Head , L.I. , Nov. 7 , 1975 Elderly Homeowners : The High Price of Keeping Warm To the Editor : The plight of older Americans has been ignored in the politics of the energy shortages . As cold weather sets in , it is important that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incomes find it increasingly difficult to pay rising fuel costs for home heating . What do older people do ? One way to adapt is to heat less area . Thus we find older Americans confined to the one heated room of their homes . Even heating one room may be too expensive . The most obvious solution of moving to a smaller house , apartment or other living situation is also the most inadequate . Moving can cause crises on many levels . Studies of forced relocation have shown its injurious effect on well-being . Senior citizen housing , which has been well received by its occupants , is not available to all potential movers . Older persons who are most comfortable in familiar surroundings and those who have lived for a long time in their own private homes may justifiably hesitate to move to another location or form of housing . Research on housing has not yet measured the significance of the familiar housing environment for older persons . However , we can intuitively sense its importance and know that older people are able to be much more independent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is a growing commitment through such endeavors as " meals on wheels " and other outreach programs to help older people remain in their own homes and communities as long as possible ; this should continue . On other levels , older homeowners have invested many years of their lives working toward owning their homes . This is a major source of security . Older persons selling homes which may be located in older , blighted areas in cities or which may be in moderate states of disrepair can not expect to receive enough money to enable them to move into housing of their choice . Buying in an overly inflated housing market with few specialized housing alternatives for older people can not be anything but detrimental . These people will be forced to relocate to dead-end living arrangements such as boarding houses or retirement hotels . Until other viable options are available to the older homeowner , the Federal Government must make a commitment to heating-fuel subsidies for these people . A special educational program and perhaps renovation grants are also necessary to insure proper insulation and effective heating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provide many services to the elderly . Heating-fuel subsidies may be the single most effective means of improving the lives of millions of older people in the United States . JONATHAN 0 , HARRIS Philadelphia , Nov. 4 , 1975 ? To the Editor : Your Oct. 25 news article from Augusta , Me. , entitled " Power Rates Cut for Aged in Maine " describes a laudable advance in that state and anticipates a problem in the United States which was well documented in a study in Portsmouth , England , in the early 1970 's . Three hundred persons over 65 years of age were studied and many found to have body temperatures 4 to 5 degrees Fahrenheit less than normal . Most of these people were unaware of their status . It was also found that many older persons receiving relatively rigid pensions were unable to provide themselves with fuel during cold winters . This left the healthy elderly patient , living alone , at great risk in the event that he injured himself at home and could not reach help . In fact , in 1966 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousand deaths per year resulting from lowered body temperatures . The United States is presently in a phase of inflation . Electricity , natural gas and fuel oil are becoming more and more costly . We would therefore hope that the advance in Maine he followed by public utilities corporations in other states as well as other industries providing fuel to the aged . A.
