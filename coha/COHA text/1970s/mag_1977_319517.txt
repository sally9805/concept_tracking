The federal laws on crime , passed piecemeal by various Congresses , have never been systematically overhauled since the beginning of the Republic . Scattered through nearly every part of the 50-title U.S. code , they are sometimes laughable . For example , deflecting a Government carrier pigeon is a federal misdemeanor . They can also be unfair . Two men committing identical bank robberies can receive wildly differing sentences from different judges . <P> Congress created a commission to study recodification into one coherent volume as long ago as 1966 . But after a bill was introduced by Senator John L. McClellan and two associates in 1973 , the Nixon Administration responded with its own version containing a series of repressive measures . Among them : a vast expansion of the death penalty , prison terms for publication of vaguely defined classified Government information and exemption from prosecution for Government officials committing crimes in the name of national security . The two bills were combined into a 753-page monster known as Senate Bill 1 ( S-l ) , which was widely attacked by civil libertarians . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ month a sweeping new version is expected to be introduced in Congress by Senator McClellan and a surprising new partner , Senator Edward M. Kennedy . McClellan , 81 , the crusty dean of congressional crime fighters , badly wants a criminal-code reform bearing the McClellan name before his expected retirement next year , and the compromise package negotiated over six months by aides of the two Senators is a far cry from the old Sl . " It 's a net gain for civil liberties , " an enthusiastic Kennedy told a House judiciary subcommittee last week . <P> Slimmed down to 270 pages , the new draft includes significant measures : <P> &gt; It drops all efforts toward an " official secrets act , " preserving current law on publication of Government data . <P> &gt; It keeps the death penalty for only one crime-skyjacking . <P> &gt; It ends all punishment for mere possession of up to ten grams of marijuana , going beyond decriminalization measures so far passed in eight states . <P> &gt; It repeals the Smith Act ( against advocating overthrow of the Government ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front " organizations ) ; and the Logan Act ( forbidding any citizen to negotiate with a foreign government ) . The three measures have been spottily enforced in recent years . <P> &gt; It slightly narrows Government wiretapping authority . <P> &gt; It drastically increases fines for white-collar crime ( e.g. up to $1 million for gross consumer fraud ) . <P> Most significantly , the compromise bill envisions a novel approach to punishment under guidelines to be established by a Federal Sentencing Commission . A narrow range of jail terms and fines is to be set up for each specific crime , and judges will be required to record their reasons for each sentence . Either side can appeal any divergence from the guidelines . <P> Passage of the bill is not certain . Senate conservatives will be sorely tempted to amend it , and the House Judiciary Committee has long been a graveyard for complicated legislation . But the Carter Administration has tentatively endorsed the compromise , and chances for passage before congressional adjournment in 1978 appear bright .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
