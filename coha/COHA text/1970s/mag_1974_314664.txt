Richard Nixon often suggested that he was personally essential to world peace and prosperity , and it was a notion that played even longer and louder outside the U.S. than it did in Peoria . For many months there was general agreement in a number of foreign capitals that the relentless pursuit of Nixon through Watergate amounted to a kind of dangerously irresponsible " lynch law , " as a strident London Times editorial put it a year ago . But by last week overseas perceptions of the nature of America 's often puzzling struggle over Watergate had changed almost completely . As a comment on the Nixon doctrine of presidential indispensability , the muted world reaction to his abdi cation was devastating . <P> Nowhere was that more apparent than in the money markets in London , Frankfurt and Zurich , where Nixon 's departure was viewed as a boon to the U.S. economy . As the inevitability of his resignation became obvious , foreign investors bid the once wallowing American dollar up to new highs . Millions went to purchase stock in American corporations , adding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <P> Deliverance . At the same time , there was little emotional reaction to Nixon 's abdication . The general feeling in European capitals was mainly one of surprise at the unexpectedly smooth resolution of America 's long , arcane agony over Watergate ( one BBC commentator noted that Nixon 's farewell " was more of an inaugural address than anything else " ) and astonishment at the resilience of American institutions . Nixon 's departure , said Vorwrts , the weekly journal of West Germany 's Social Democratic Party , was " a deliverance . " Headlined Turin 's daily La Stampa : AMERICA HAS WON , NIXON RESIGNS . <P> In the Middle East the resignation created ripples of uncertainty . Arab governments were unhappy to see Nixon go ; they credit him with the " even-handed " policy that the U.S. has followed so successfully since the October war . The Arabs have their doubts about President Ford , who has been a vocal supporter of Israel . In Egypt , where President Anwar Sadat has staked his hopes for an acceptable settlement on the personal assurances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resignation news was played down . <P> The Israelis had worries of their own about Ford . Whatever the new President 's inclinations , which Israelis see as pro-Israel , one aide to Premier Yitzhak Rabin fretted that " the Russians will want to test the new man , and the test could come in the Middle East . " Possibly in Syria : the Soviet Union has poured in $2 billion worth of armaments in the past several months , making Syria today perhaps a greater military threat to Israel than Egypt .
