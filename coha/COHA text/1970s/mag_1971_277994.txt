THE Nixonian rubric laid upon the Burger Court is " Strict construction of the Constitution . " If history is any guide , critics will soon accuse the court of ignoring this mandate in favor of personal opinions or even partisan politics . And the shrewdest critics will be the nation 's ablest court watchers-the legal scholars who often find the court guilty of faulty legal reasoning . <P> Scholars have lambasted court rulings that go back as far as the seminal Marbury v. Madison decision ( 1803 ) , which asserted the court 's power to overturn congressional legislation . They gasp at the Dred Scott case ( 1857 ) , which denied that a Negro could be a U.S. citizen . They are still apoplectic over Koreinatsu v. U.S. ( 1944 ) , complaining of its shabby justification for interning 70,000 Japanese-American citizens . Just as they winced throughout the Warren years , they are beginning to look askance at the Burger era . Says University of Chicago Law Professor Philip Kurland : " We have no evidence yet that the new court will afford principled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it will emulate the Warren Court in this regard . " <P> What if it does ? Who besides a few law professors and commentators really cares about " principled " decisions ? Is n't a decision itself far more important than any arcane reasoning that might justify it-especially if the public applauds ? <P> In fact , sound reasoning is crucial to the nation 's stability , because it buttresses the Supreme Court 's authority as the final umpire that rules on claims to power-whether by states against federal agencies , or by government against individuals . Sound reasoning validates the court 's role as interpreter of the Constitution , mediator of national experience , symbol of values that transcend politics . <P> One of the Supreme Court 's great tasks is moderation , the accommodation of rival interests and especially so in a nation undergoing explosive social change . Unless decisions are explained with sufficient care , lower courts may be unclear about the broad principles they are supposed to apply in particular cases . When the Supreme Court scants reason in favor of mere results , says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ valid only as long as you have a majority of five votes . As the reasons get weaker , a later judge is freer to follow his own likes and dislikes . A decision is then easier to overturn . " <P> According to Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes , " the Constitution is what the judges say it is . " But saying what it is in a highly disciplined way-making exact distinctions , refining a principle to fit diverse cases-that is the high art judges are chosen to practice . Deluged with 3,500 cases a year , expected to write more than 100 often highly complex decisions , Supreme Court Justices may understandably disappoint their critics . Indeed , many critics ( joined by Chief Justice Burger ) endlessly urge the court to cut its workload , accept only truly vital cases and take more time for reflection .
