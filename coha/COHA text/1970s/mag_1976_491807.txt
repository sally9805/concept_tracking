The exasperation of serving as a Cabinet officer has driven some men to silence and ulcers , and others into fits of ornery speech , therefore curmudgeonry . Ah , a curmudgeon is just what William E. Simon , our Secretary of Treasury , has turned out to be , and it 's too had we can enjoy only a few more months of his blunt , biting talk , because he vows he will leave office , come January , 1977 , no matter what , including the election of President Ford . The conventional wisdom in Washington holds that Simon is ultraconservative in fiscal affairs , a preacher of the " old-time religion " in economics , and a man whose stubborn adherence to conviction sometimes warrants titters , if not laughter . But Simon deserves more than labels ; he merits a closer look . He worries not about losing the approval of the Washington elite , or even about becoming an unpopular national figure . He talks and acts the way his principles guide him , and if this means disagreeing with President Ford @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Bill Simon does so . If his convictions so dictate , Simon stands up before the 1975 convention of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and declares that the Ford administration will not sponsor any new large-scale programs to end unemployment for blacks because the consequent inflation would make it even worse for blacks in the long run . Simon got tiny applause for that one . After all , by sticking to his ideas and expressing them , Simon moved his family from a $75-a-month basement apartment in Orange , New Jersey , to a brilliant success on Wall Street , multimillionaire comfort , and the reputation of being one of the soundest financial men in the Republic . He is , to say the least , an unabashed defender of the free market system . And so his views fill the air . " The Shah is a nut , " he once told a financial reporter , adding that he meant the Irani ruler is a nut about oil . Though there were verbal explosions in the Shah 's Palace in Teheran , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not plan to visit Iran , Simon never really backed off from his statement . And at a time when most public figures shun former President Richard Nixon like a leper , Simon makes it clear that " Mr. Nixon will be remembered favorably ten to twenty years from now for his initiatives in foreign policy and for trying to decentralize the federal government . " John Mitchell , once Attorney General and now convicted in the Watergate case ? " John was and is still a close personal friend of ours , " Simon declared without blinking an eye through his thick glasses . He is always sarcastic , and often vitriolic , about Congress and its spending programs . " The coconuts on the Hill , " he said one day over lunch , to describe the legislative body of the world 's most powerful nation , " do n't realize that rhetoric ai n't reality . They apparently do n't know that inflation is utterly regressive . They spent $1 trillion in the Sixties and got nothing for it but inflation . " It is clear that Simon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , more than unemployment . Every speech , discussion , argument Simon is involved in winds up with his sermon on inflation . " Every society that failed to deal with fundamental issues like inflation has littered history with its ruins , " Simon declares . " Our society can not tolerate sustained single-digit inflation . Double-digit would create a financial collapse in the U.S. Can a family , a business or a government spend more money than it takes in every year ? Of course not , but our government covers this folly by just printing more money every year . " Simon then points out that from 1955 through 1965 , the money supply grew at an annual rate of 21/2 percent , and there was price stability . Since 1965 , the money growth rate shot up to 6 percent , and the economy could n't absorb this flood of paper . " It is no accident , " Simon says , " that inflation has become a chronic problem . " Free-flowing money and high government spending are techniques followed by economic liberals who are intent on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against big federal spending . " For most of our history , " he says , " a $100 billion federal budget was like the four-minute mile in track : it was a limit that was never broken . Then in 1962 , we finally went over the $100 billion mark . But we were n't content . Seven years later , the budget broke the $200 billion barrier , and in 1975 , we cracked $300 billion . Now we are spending $1 billion each and every day of the year . So , we 've had budget deficits in fourteen of the past fifteen years . Hell , we 're even borrowing money now which wo n't be paid back by the government until the year 2001 . " " It is n't just the amounts , it 's the growing share of the gross national product taken by government . In 1930 , federal , state and local government took 12 percent of the G.N.P . Now , it 's 33 percent , and if the trend continues , it will be 60 percent by the year 2,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what people produce , robbing them of their economic freedoms , can there be any doubt that the loss of their social and personal freedoms will follow ? " The major beneficiary of inflation is the government . Can you believe that , but it is . Inflation pushes people into higher tax brackets , so more tax revenue comes to the Treasury Department , and this allows Congress to think up more programs . These so-called compassionate people in government have as manysolutions as there are problems . " These damned solutions mean spending , deficits and government economic control . So they cry , we 'll have national health insurance , and we 'll transfer funds from those who earn to those who yearn . The result is rampant inflation . The very people they 're trying to help , they hurt the most  --  namely , the poor , the disadvantaged , the elderly and those on fixed income . " Inflation just does n't hurt us at home , either . Our exports and imports are only 12 percent of G.N.P. , but still are the largest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so big . Therefore , we export our inflation , and this hurts other nations . " Once it sets in , finance ministers abroad see the world lurching to the left as confused people lean more and more on government solutions . Finance ministers like Hans Apel of West Germany and Mario Simonsen of Brazil and others around the world look to the United States as the beacon of economic stability , free enterprise and freedom . If we fail , then their hope for world economic stability is diminished . " Let me remind you . One year ago we had 14 percent inflation in the U.S. , and now it 's down to 6 percent and everybody 's relieved . But in 1971 , 41/2 percent was considered intolerable . Each time we start from a higher plateau . That 's how inflation runs away . " Nothing is more odious to the average American than the income tax system . As a good American who has long felt disgust with that system , and now has authority over it ( through the Internal Revenue Service at Treasury @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite radical . In a word , Simon would eliminate all loopholes , meaning most deductions , and employ a simple , progressive income tax . Nowadays , the I.R.S. reports that half the tax returns it receives contain errors , and one-fifth are attempts at fraud . Simon believes all this results from a perversion of the principles which should govern the American tax system  --  equity , simplicity and efficiency . " Whenever there is ad hoc tax reform , the kind you read about , " Simon says , " you really wind up with a massive relief act for lawyers and accountants . There are now 6,000 pages of fine print in the I.R.S. manual . Only a Philadelphia lawyer can read it , and I doubt that many of them can read . Half of the American people must go to tax preparers to fill out their forms . The other half spend millions of agonizing hours at it . I 've got a growing bureaucracy of 85,000 people at I.R.S. The process is insidious . " I favor ending all loopholes , and keeping only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If you want to help housing , pass a specific measure . All special deductions  --  out . Liability , out . Catastrophic insurance  --  put it in the budget . Expense accounts  --  out . " I also favor an end to double taxation  --  taxing corporate incomes and subsequent taxing of individuals receiving corporate dividends . Business is people . People pay taxes , businesses do n't . But demagogues would attack this , I know . " You could not eliminate everything at once . There would have to be grandfather clauses , and the new system phased in . I do not believe in retroactive remedies . " The " Simon System " would have people in the $100,000 income bracket paying more tax than they do now , and those below $20,000 paying less . The poorest would pay no tax at all . In fact , Simon even believes in " income maintenance " for the poor  --  a system to replace the complicated , expensive and scandal-ridden welfare system which burdens so many states now . " Welfare reform is long overdue , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go up the chimney when I bring it up . But income maintenance  --  grants to the poor  --  is the answer . Otherwise , welfare program just adds on wel. fare program , and look what you get . " Our energy policies are a national disgrace , " Simon says with an emphasis which betrays his tough experience as Federal Energy Administration administrator in 1973 and 1974 . He now favors the elimination of that agency , by the way . " Originally , F.E.A. was to be a temporary , emergency measure . Neither I nor anyone else wanted to become a czar . But that 's exactly what 's happening because bureaucrats and bureaucracies have a way of subsequently taking on a life of their own . " So today , we have a constant clamor on the political front for more and more federal regulation and control of petroleum and related energy industries . Given the oil industry 's public image , there are cries for divestiture , a move that would potentially cripple , rather than enhance , our energy potential . " Simon claims @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Phillips decision on pricing caused a decline in exploration and reserve building . " Goods that can not be produced for profit , " Simon says , as though he were teaching Economics I ( Adam Smith variety ) , " will decline . " According to Simon , the oil producers began relying more on Persian Gulf oil  --  cheaper to acquire than oil in the United States . " So they did n't push in the shallow wells , into new fields or on the outer continental shelf , " he says . " They were getting oil for a nickel to a dime a barrel out of the Persian Gulf in the early Sixties . All through this period there were warnings that we were on a collision course between production and consumption . As the gap widened , the energy crisis developed , and it hit us during the Arab oil embargo . " There is plenty of oil in the world , and there will be more . Theproblem is the concentration in the Persian Gulf . The Shah is at the bottom of it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are allowing our oil bill to soar  --  from $3 billion in 1970 to $35 billion in 1976 . Is n't that marvelous policy ? Just outstanding . A national disgrace . " What we need to do is to remove all impediments to domestic production of energy . Take oil and natural gas off control . It takes eleven years to get a nuclear plant here , and four in Europe  --  let 's change that . Up to last year , we were taking the same amount of coal out of the ground as we did forty years ago . We have half of the world 's coal reserve , but we 're not taking it out of the ground . " We do not work toward achieving compatibility between environmentalism and energy needs . It 's insane . We have failed to explain theenergy situation . We are paying severe economic and political prices for this . " Though Simon has blue-ribbon conservative credentials in fiscal and economic matters , liberals warm to his freely expressed views on tax reform , replacing welfare with income maintenance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is for the competitive marketplace . " That 's how consumers all across the world get the best break , " he says , " including American consumers . It is those who protect domestic interests  --  not the consumers  --  who advocate protectionism . This happens in every single country in the world , especially on agriculture . " We have adequate safeguards in the U.S. against other countries ' dumping merchandise here at prices below what they charge at home . These laws are no better than the ones the Secretary of Treasury administers , and I administer them . " The United Auto Workers Union complained in 1975 to Treasury that five European nations , Canada and Japan were selling cars in the U.S. for less than at home . An investigation by the Treasury Department revealed that several foreign auto makers had indeed " dumped " this way . But rather than imposing a heavy-handed set of new duties on the imports , Simon chose to get the offenders to modify the practice . It would have been good politics for Simon to huff-and-puff against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and preserve the free trade principle . Similarly , Simon spoke ardently at a Cabinet meeting to persuade President Ford not to impose protectionist quotas on shoes , but to offer trade assistance to United States manufacturers and workers . " I was also firmly opposed to putting quotas on specialty steel , " Simon says . " If foreign steel companies can make their stuff cheaply , better , and more efficiently , why should n't they have access to our market , just as we should have access to their markets with our agricultural products which we can produce cheaper and more efficiently ? We 're the world 's best in that . " World trade has grown from $55 billion in 1950 , to $800 billion in 1975 ; and although United States participation in world trade is limited , the United States remains the world 's largest exporter and importer . Since we produce one-fourth of the world 's products , even a small share of this amounts to a big piece of the world market . Wherever Simon speaks , he thumps hard for reducing and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says , " that 's the basis of the free market system . " He extends his principle to Chile , an authoritarian regime which is a favorite target of the world 's liberals and Socialists . It is unpopular for Simon to defend Chile , but he says : " The present Chilean regime is clearly in the best interests of the world compared with the Marxist regime of Allende . Chile had been the leader of democratic societies in Latin America , and they could n't tolerate the kind of repression Allende brought . It had also taken on economic dimensions . " So now we are trying to move Chile back to freedom . We remind them of human rights because there is a problem in our Congress on this issue . Economic assistance has been cut . So it is best that Chile address itself to the human rights question . " But Simon says he expresses his views on human rights to all countries which are holding political prisoners as Chile is . " Iran is the worst in the world , " he says emphatically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Simon 's general policy toward the rest of the world is to walk softly , carry a strong economy back home , and stare ' em in the eye . He is especially proud of the resounding victory of the United States at the International Monetary Fund meeting in Jamaica last winter . " We had been fighting for a competitive position for the U.S. in the world , " Simon says , " and we got it . The dollar had been overvalued far too long . It all went back to the Bretton Woods conference after World War II when we were helping the whole world . Well , the world has changed . So now the dollar is at a realistic level . " Simon was also successful in restraining the I.M.F . from granting easier loans to poor countries by arguing that the private banks , on which these loans depend , are already wary of their ability to repay . There is a serious question of default because banks have overextended themselves in loans to underdeveloped countries . A dependency situation has developed , and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notion to think that the world 's wealth should be shared . We must enlarge the pie , not redistribute it . The countries that put themselves on a business basis  --  Taiwan , Korea , Brazil and others  --  let the marketing system work , and thus they created a goodclimate for investment . They succeeded , and developing countries who only push the share-the-wealth idea wo n't . " The question is do we want to be respected , as opposed to being loved ? I do n't believe that the U.S. can be loved around the world . The State Department 's mission is to have us loved everywhere ; that 's why they 're always recommending giving so much money to everybody . That 's a fool 's mission . " If we are going to be strong and respected abroad , we must be strong economically at home . That also gives us the wherewithal to be strong militarily . We 've got to have a noninflationary , growing economy to cut poverty , and it is necessary that we have a strong military . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of trouble with the Korean and Vietnamese wars . Should we go to war because our leaders say so ? If we go , we should go to win . Otherwise , I hate to see the attrition , the killing of our fine youth in useless wars . I 'm not sure we tried to win those last two wars . " If Simon has a remedy to what he sees as the great follies and excesses of our time , it is to use the simple word , " no . " He asks , " Is n't it time we decided our priorities ? We must stop mandated federal spending programs which swell budgets . We 've got to say ' no ' around the world , too . Our basic responsibility is to worry that the country is to be keptsound for our children . " Adam Smith is Simon 's hero . It 's a wonder that Smith 's statue does n't stand in his office . Simon says that just as the Declaration of Independence spelled the American ideal of political freedom , so Smith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free economy in America . And he loves to quote Smith 's " natural order , " i.e. , " Every man , so long as he does not violate the laws of justice , is left perfectly free to pursue his interests in his own way and to bring both his industry and capital into competition with those of any other man or all men . " Simon becomes angry when he hears about how American businessmen contribute money to universities whose professors , as Simon says , " tear down the system . " " All I ask these businessmen , " Simon declares , " is to question whether these institutions are educating students dedicated to the free enterprise system . One professor in a prominent business school says that he teaches socialism because free enterprise is dead . That 's the Galbraith line , too . " Well , I want my children to learn about Adam Smith and the free economy , too , and then make their own choice . That 's all I ask . I want freedom and balance . Teach them everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time when many businessmen seem more concerned abouttheir expense accounts and pension programs , and are almost passive in defense of the system which provides the goodies and benefits , Simon is the Billy Graham of the upwith-enterprise circuit . He sounds like a Fourth of July speaker in halls where seemingly sophisticated rhetoric about the faults of the American system has just rung out . To boost confidence , Simon likes to list these standards of performance of the American economy since World War II : ? Since the late 1950 's , real purchasing power of Americans has jumped by 40 percent , average family income has risen to over $13,000 a year , twenty million new jobs have been created , and we have cut the number of people below the poverty line in half . ? Our farmers harvest more than twice as much grain as farmers a generation ago , and they use fewer workers to do it . ? Medical science has added ten years to our lives over this period . ? Our economic abundance has made it possible for us to give $110 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since the end of World War II . ? And Americans today have more leisure time for study , recreation and self-improvement than any society in recorded history . We continue to spend about 90 percent of our personal disposable income on ourselves . William Edward Simon was born November 27 , 1927 , in Paterson , New Jersey . He was third in a family of four children . As a youngster , Simon worked around the yard for his father , and later in his high school years , as a lifeguard near Spring Lake , New Jersey . At Blair Academy and then Newark Academy , Bill Simon excelled in swimming , and by 1944 was competing in the Pacific Olympics . But before the war ended , Simon wanted to quit high school and join the Merchant Marine . " My father was old-fashioned , " Simon recalls . " I wanted to go in the Merchant Marine and make the Murmansk run . I was putting the full court press on him to let me go . But he handled me well , and made it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high school . " As soon as I graduated , I joined the infantry . I was seventeen and the war was over . But I was with the first troops who landed in southern Japan . It was in incredibly bad shape , and years later , when I took Carol to Japan , I could n't believe the changes . " When he left the Army in 1948 , he entered Lafayette College , Easton , Pennsylvania . Simon had been a below-average student in high school , more interested in swimming , beer drinking and poker than anything else . But the military matured him , and he did better in college . He almost made the dean 's list , and wounu up with an 80-plus average at Lafayette College . He had been dating Carol Girard , an attractive girl , a friend of one of Simon 's sisters . After ten months of this courtship , Carol and Simon married . She was nineteen , he twenty-three . His monthly income was $105 from the G.I. bill , $35 from ROTC , and whatever he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the difference . Simon claims he also made a lot of money at poker . The children started to come . Bill , Jr. , a year after they were married , and then , in the space of fifteen years , seven more . " Our generation married young , " Simon says , " and had anywhere from three to seven children . We were traditionalists , all fundamentally conservative people . " Simon 's plans for law school were scotched after a run of bad luck in health . Carol had an operation . Then Bill , Jr. , required surgery to relieve a strangulated hernia . Then Bill , Sr. , had a hemorrhoidectomy . With $5,000 in back medical bills , Simon went to work at Union Securities Company , in New York City , at $75 a week . He was made manager of Union 's Municipal Trading Department only three years after he went to work there , and was then offered a better job by another investment company for a smaller salary . " Until I arrived at Salomon Brothers in 1964 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jobs for less money . People told me I was crazy to go with Salomon . They said I would be eaten alive . " Instead , Simon became a dynamo at the prestigious Wall Street firm and showed enormous skill in buying and selling municipal bonds . When he left Salomon in 1973 to join the Nixon administration , Simon was a full partner earning from $2 to $3 million a year , and had salted away a fortune estimated at $7 million . Simon , a congenital Republican , had his first affair with politics when he was twenty-six . He helped organize a Young Republican club in Orange , which met in a recreation room of a women 's club . Mostly beer and pretzels , he says . But Simon developed a following in Essex County , and the day came when the bosses wanted him to run for Deputy Surrogate of Newark . He was earning $6,000 a year at the time . " They offered to finance a new house for me , and said I was a cinch to be elected to the $13,500-a-year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Think of the poor people who say yes to things like this , because they 've just sold their soul for a bowl of porridge . ' So we packed up and moved to another town . I was disgusted with the political process . " In 1972 , Simon was a fund-raiser for the Nixon campaign , and managed to extract $100,000 in contributions from his partners at Salomon Brothers . Not long after that election , Simon was phoned by a talent scout in the White House . " They told me I was being considered for the Department of Housing and Urban Development , " Simon said . " I guess I could have had the HUD job , but George Schultz , then Secretary of Treasury , nixed it . He said if Simon comes to Washington , he comes to Treasury . " And that 's where Simon landed , January 22 , 1973 , as Deputy Secretary of Treasury . The following December , when the energy crisis hit , Simon was named administrator of the Federal Energy Office . " Simon says " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ national figure . He was loyal to President Nixon through the entire Watergate affair , even speaking at Nixon defense rallies conducted by Rabbi Baruch Korff . In April 1974 , when the going was rough , President Nixon nominated Simon for Secretary of Treasury . Simon had no trouble being confirmed . Now , as he is preparing to leave that post , the future is open . Carol Simon believes their life will resume in New Jersey without much need for adjustment . " Bill is too energetic and impatient to go off to some university or foundation post , " she says . " He 'll be back in a firm . " Simon only says that he wants to sit on a beach for a while , and make up for the years that " I 've been a lousy father . " But he has never publicly ruled out a political career in New Jersey , and there has been a certain amount of speculation that he will one day run for governor in his home state . Simon has no regrets for having come to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the most pervasive agency in government . It cuts across every domestic and foreign issue . State , Defense and Treasury are the visible ones . I do n't frustrate very easily . If I win a situation , fine . If I lose , full steam ahead . I 've felt comfortable here . The President agrees with my basic philosophy . " The reward anyone in public life gets is what history judges him to have accomplished . I believe in our system , and I 've felt that no man invited into the government can say no . ' That 's the responsibility of every American . I 'm old-fashioned , I guess . "
