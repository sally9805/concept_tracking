THE MASARYK CASE by Claire Sterling . 366 pages . Harper &; Row . $7.95 . <P> Views of the cold war are still being busily revised . Much that was once taken on this side of the Iron Curtain as a clear-cut matter of Soviet aggression is now being questioned . Among many events that revisionism is unlikely to explain away , however , is the murder of Jan Masaryk in Prague on March 10 , 1948 . <P> Or so Claire Sterling concludes in a new study of the case . The Czechoslovakian Foreign Minister , she says , was murdered-exactly as cold war history had it-by the Communists , under Soviet direction , two weeks after the party had taken power in Czechoslovakia . The guilty party was quick to declare Masaryk a suicide . Even in 1948 , hardly anybody in Prague believed the story . Four weeks ago , after more than 20 years , the Czech Communists closed an investigation they themselves had opened under the liberal Dubcek regime . Despite the new presence of the Russian army , they withdrew the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Dec. 19 , 1969 ) , they decided that Masaryk 's fall from his bathroom window was an accident . <P> Detective Story . The circumstances were obscene . At sunrise on March 10 , Masaryk 's body was found in the courtyard of the Cernn Palace . He was in pajamas , barefoot . He lay on his back a yard from the open bathroom window 30 feet above . He seemed to have landed on his feet , for both legs were broken at the ankles , the heels shattered , the stumps protruding and bits of bone strewn over the cobbles . His hands were scuffed , and the fingernails had paint or plaster beneath them . <P> Within minutes of the " discovery " of Masaryk 's body , the case and his apartment were sealed off by the Communist-run security police , led by Interior Minister Vclav Nosek . Within months , at least 25 people who knew something , or were believed to know something , were locked up . Of these , 14 were executed , murdered , committed suicide or , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> By sifting every scrap of evidence and interviewing virtually everyone still alive who could have knowledge of the death , the author has reconstructed certain essentials . There was extreme disorder in both Masaryk 's bedroom and bathroom-pillows on the bathroom floor and in the dry tub , glass bottles from the medicine chest ground under foot , a smear of excrement on the sill . Strangely , Masaryk had gone out the bathroom window even though it was much smaller than the one in the bedroom and very awkward to reach . <P> Claire Sterling , a veteran foreign correspondent now on the staff of Harper 's Magazine , relies heavily on such physical facts , construed more logically , to prove murder . On authority from forensic medicine , she makes the point that men on the point of suicide do not lose control of their bowels . Such loss of control is a symptom of the last stages of suffocation .

When he was unconscious or nearly so , he was shoved out the nearest window , feet first .
