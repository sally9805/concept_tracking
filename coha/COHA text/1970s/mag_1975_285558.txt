Most medical authorities agree that it is unthinkable for a physician to with hold a proven remedy for a disease from his patients . But in 1972 , the U.S. Pub lic Health Service reluctantly admitted that it had done just that . In an effort to study the effects of syphilis on the human body , the PHS , in a Macon County , Ala. , study , allowed 425 poor , un educated black men who had the dis ease , and who were recruited through local clinics , to go untreated . The dis closure of the 40-year study stirred an immediate outcry ( TIME , Aug. 7 , 1972 ) and led to a $1.8 billion suit against the Federal Government by lawyers rep resenting both those who had survived and the families of those who had died during the study or have died since . <P> Last week the Government acknowledged its moral obligation to those it had failed to treat . A federal judge in Montgomery approved a settlement that will benefit each unwitting participant in the ill-conceived study . Those who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred others who were included in the study as controls but did not have the disease will get $15,000 if they are still alive ; otherwise their estates will receive $5,000 . Nor will the men who died of the complications of syphilis or of other causes during the course of the study or since then be com pletely forgotten . Under the terms of the settlement , their estates will get $15,000.
