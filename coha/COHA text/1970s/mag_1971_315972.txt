IN the blackboard-crisp terms favored by its Pentagon planners , the Laotian operation is deep into its third and final phase . Having slashed across some tendrils of the Ho Chi Minh Trail and choppered into Tchepone , South Viet Nam 's troops are beginning to pull back to the border . As the withdrawal gathered speed last week , the question was increasingly asked : Was it worth it ? The answer will not be known in full until the operation is over , but it can be partly determined by comparing the ARVN struggle in Laos with the invasion 's original goals . <P> Spoiling the Communist infiltration routes was only one duty assigned to the ARVN troops sent into Laos . Another important , though unstated task was to draw much larger North Vietnamese forces into massing along the trail so that they could then be hammered by U.S. airpower . For obvious reasons , neither Washington nor Saigon has greatly stressed that a key feature of Lam Son was to use ARVN as bait in order to kill North Vietnamese troops . <P> <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " protect " withdrawing U.S. troops , even though that has been the longer-range justification advanced most often by the Administration . From the start , Richard Nixon 's own top advisers described Lam Son-and the parallel thrust by 20,000 ARVN troops into Cambodia-mainly as an opportunity to reap some short-term gains . One important objective was to shore up the embattled regime in Cambodia by taking further pressure off the Cambodian army to the south . Another was to blunt Communist capability to wage offensives in South Viet Nam , particularly any attack that might upset two approaching presidential elections : Nguyen Van Thieu 's in October and Richard Nixon 's in November 1972 . <P> However Lam Son comes out , the results-as with so much in Southeast Asia-are unlikely to be clear-cut and decisive . Some objectives and how they have fared in the battle so far : <P> BUYING TIME . According to the U.S. Command , more than ten of the 30 North Vietnamese battalions in the Laotian panhandle have been annihilated ; the enemy is said to have lost 11,176 men . General Creighton Abrams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vietnamese can now mount a major offensive in 1971 , and possibly not until the spring of 1972 . That , unfortunately , is the kind of expectation the Communists have explosively upset in the past , notably during Tet 1968 . Even if Lam Son has slowed the Communist supply effort , it has done so only temporarily . If South Vietnamese forces do stay in Laos until mid-April , the Communists will still have several weeks to recoup before the monsoon completely closes the trail . To win this temporary advantage , the allies have paid dearly . Though the U.S. toll has been relatively light-69 dead or missing , 64 wounded , 73 helicopters destroyed-the South Vietnamese suffered considerable casualties . Saigon admits to 918 ARVN dead , but unofficial estimates put the toll closer to 2,000 crack troops dead or missing and another 4,000 wounded . Compared with Cambodia , Lam Son has so far yielded only one-fourth as many captured enemy weapons , one-half as much ammunition , one-fifth as much rice and about the same number of enemy dead-at a cost of about seven times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
