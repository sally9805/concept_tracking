by SAMUEL BECKETT 128 pages . Grove Press . <P> <P> FIZZLES <P> by SAMUEL BECKETT 61 pages . Grove Press . <P> Each $6.95. $1.95 paperback . <P> <P> Coming from almost any author but Samuel Beckett , 70 , these two collections might seem slight to the point of frippery . Ends and Odds contains eight brief pieces for the stage , radio or television . Fizzles offers an even more self-derisive title , generous margins , plenty of white space and eight snippets of prose , the longest of which does not quite fill nine pages . Yet in Beckett 's case , the oddity is not that $13.90 ( plus tax ) purchases so few words , but that those words were written at all . <P> For Beckett 's career , which began when he served as an aide to James Joyce and was capped in 1969 by a Nobel Prize , can be seen as a long , inexorable process of writing himself into a corner of silence . From the start , he was profoundly uninterested in the standard material of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , incidents , resolution , endings happy or otherwise . Instead , the Dublin-born author seized with Irish tenacity a single perception : reductio is always ad absurdum . At the bottom of every problem , no matter how logically pared down to essentials , lies the abyss . That has been Beckett 's destination all along . The wonder is not simply that he has persisted so obsessively at such a self-defeating task . Nor that he abandoned his native English for French and then set about retranslating himself . Most astonishing is the volume of high comedy and pathos he has managed to squeeze from his abstract principles . <P> Last Ditch . The power of Beckett 's works springs from a contradiction deeper than theories and more profound than nihilism . Like the hobos , clowns , cripples and basket cases who make up his cast of characters , Beckett is a Poet of the Last Ditch , a Bard of the Bitter End . Like them , he knows that he wants to stop talking . Like them , he knows he can not . <P> Faced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weary resignation and fits of intense anger at a world he can neither take nor leave . As Waiting for Godot showed startled audiences in 1953 , those face-changing moods can produce compelling theater . Since then , Beckett has devoted the bulk of his dwindling output to drama and to voices , in various stages of disembodiment , passing the time of their Lives . Ends and Odds collects the most recent examples and proves that Beckett is still strong medicine , even in small doses . <P> In Not I , for example , a female speaker designated " Mouth " commits an extended monologue on the shock she felt when she found herself talking out loud after a mute childhood . She speaks in short , half-connected bursts , yet Beckett 's stingy way with words captures her existence fully : " ... parents unknown ... unheard of ... he having vanished ... thin air ... no sooner buttoned up his breeches ... she similarly ... eight months later ... almost to the tick ... so no love ... spared that ... no love such as normally vented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as simple as " spared that , " Beckett blends savage humor and poignancy .
