txt Louis Wiznitzer , a Brazilian journalist based in New York for La Presse of Montreal , has been in Algeria where he talked with local leaders and took a close look at President Boumedienne 's brand of socialism . " Two months from now , a coup d'etat will make a clean sweep of this regime . " Such was the claim of a report received in Paris on June 19 , 1965 , after the formation of the Provisional Revolutionary Council , set up by Col. Houari Boumedienne . Six years now have passed , and a great calm covers the country . The reign of the French generals , Raoul Salan , Jacques Massu , Edmond Jouhaud , the thugs , the paratrooper-torturers , the OAS , the terror and tortures , are so many nightmares which time is eradicating . To be sure , in the tortuous alleys of the Casbah , behind the Spanish-Moorish facades , in the depths of the crowds of itinerant merchants , among the scents of snails , fried foods , olives , on the terraces of the old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revolutionary martyr , there is still some intriguing . The moist , heavy air of Algiers , the Mediterranean breezes , contribute to this . And yet Ahmed ben Bella  --  once the people 's idol  --  now is forgotten . His successor  --  whose self-effacement had earned him the nickname of " the Sphinx of Algiers ' ? has led the chariot of state with steady hands for six years . Unlike certain of his predecessors , President Boumedienne has avoided the pitfalls of demagoguery ; and even his detractors are obliged to admit his sincerity . // *Algeria : fewer words and slogans // Convinced that the political independence of Algeria , gained by force of arms , will not survive unless based on economic independence , Mr. Boumedienne has mobilized the country 's intellectual and material resources with one major objective in view : to guarantee an income to every family in Algeria by 1980 . In other words , he is preparing a full-scale launching of the economy , trying to lift the country out of the grip of underdevelopment . An obsession ? even a mania @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so typical of the Algerians which I saw at the time of my last visit four years ago . There is no ? longer any question , for the country 's leaders , of following the example of Cuba , or even of India . Instead , the Japanese example is held up as the subject of much admiration . Barren hinterland A brilliant young economist from the CNES ( National Economic and Social Council ) told me : " Fidel Castro has paid dearly because of words and slogans . He was wrong in attempting to apply foreign socioeconomic models to his country . For their confrontation with the American colossus , the Cubans have all our sympathy . But Fidel Castro 's administration has above all shown us what errors to avoid . " Of course , the idea of socialism within an egalitarian society remains one of the regime 's fundamental options . Besides , it expresses the aspiration of the people . Yet , in concrete terms , what the government is striving to achieve is to put industrial equipment into operation , fight illiteracy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Of the 2,300,000 square kilometers of Algerian soil , only 300,000 ? those along the sea  --  are fertile . The remainder forms an enormous , barren hinterland , like a huge dead weight , The regime 's task is to revive this land , to make it produce . Water under the desert Manganese , tungsten ore , gold , and uranium have all been found beneath the soil of the Hoggar regim In . Tamanrasset , I met American , Canadian , Russian , and Romanian pilots flying mysterious planes equipped with electronic detectors . And under the Sahara Desert there exists a huge water table which could one day irrigate the whole of the eastern and western Ergs , huge desert stretches . The country 's tourist resources are equally formidable : 12,000 kilometers of coast , beaches , sea cliffs , mountain ranges for skiing , a wealth of archaeological sites ? Roman ruins , prehistoric frescoes  --  to explore . For the time being , the government 's main object is to exploit the sale of hydrocarbons to the maximum and to build a heavy industry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modernization of agriculture , the formation of a light industry , and reduction of unemployment . Eager to press on , those in charge of the industrial and mineralogical sector have formed a sort of cult of the rational . The yhave already obtained computers which will enable them to analyze the results of prospecting and to begin to obtain an estimate of their profit-earning capacity . President walks tightrope But it must be said that many Algerians ? some of President Boumedienne 's closest associates included  --  are uneasy about this infatuation with technology . They evoke the specter of massive political apathy and a situation where state-directed capitalism will result in the formation of a new bourgeoisie , a privileged class . So Mr. Boumedienne walks a tightrope between his " political " colleagues and " technocratic " advisers ( a rather summary distinction anyway ) . And if he has resolutely turned his back on Marxism and Populist rhetoric , he remains concerned with the social and humanistic context within which the national economy is being developed . When he assumed power , President Boumedienne was denounced by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trotsky , and disciple of ' The " Guevara . Others characterized him as a fanatic of Islam ? had n't he studied at El Azar University in Cairo ? We know today that he refused to liquidate the kulaks , or landowners , and that he refrained from harnessing the Algerian masses in Maoist fashion . Private and even foreign capital is certainly not jeered at in Algiers , with the exception of certain restrictions dictated by the national interest . And the voices of American , German , and Japanese businessmen , who come to buy , sell , and negotiate from all parts of the globe , fill the salons of the Hotel St. Georges and the garden terrace of the Aletti Hotel , Formidable obstacles Moreover , President Boumedienne revealed the extent of his " religious fanaticism " when he approved the construction of the new Constantine University ( whose architect , Oscar Niemeyer , is the designer of Brasilia ) on the site of an ancient Muslim cemetery , in spite of those who accused him of desecration . Certainly the pragmatically minded Algerian regime has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some formidable obstacles . The birth rate has now risen to 3.2 percent . Underemployment is the scourge of modern Algeria . A personal survey I conducted among 10 people of differing social strata and from different parts of the country confirmed figures previously reported : The salary of one full-time worker ensures the living of eight people . The lack of trained personnel , a primitive agricultural system , political and economic pressure from France seeking to exert the last vestiges of its colonial hegemony , the toll taken by the eight-year struggle for independence ( one million dead ) from which the country has not yet recovered  --  all so many mortgages which six years of hard work have not been enough to resolve . But the government has staked its reputation on the success of the new four-year plan for 1969-1973 . One of its architects assured me that by 1980 people would be talking about the " miracle Algerien " as they talked about West Germany , Italy , and Japan .                @ @ @ @ @
