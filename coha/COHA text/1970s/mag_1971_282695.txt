At first , the Soviets grabbed the headlines with a dazzling array of new aircraft , especially the TU-144 supersonic jetliner . But when the Paris Air Show got into full swing last week , the French crowds were flocking to see a competing SST , the Anglo-French Concorde . If the Western European jet makes its commercial debut in 1974 or 1975 , it will be the first supersonic liner in regular service . TIME 'S Paris bureau chief , William Rademaekers , went to Le Bourget Airport to look at the Concorde , and was invited to become one of the first journalists to ride in it . His test-flight report : <P> THE Concorde engines whined to life in familiar high-pitched fashion , and the plane rolled slowly toward the end of the runway . I was twelve minutes away from personally breaking the sound barrier . Unlike the Boeing 707 and 747 , which lumber into slowly gathering momentum , the Concorde has a sprinter 's start . I was pushed gently but firmly into my backrest . From the rear of the plane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upward and upward until the fuselage looked like a tipping tunnel of love . From the inside , the noise was no louder than that of a normal jet . We were off the ground in seconds and climbing at a sharp angle . <P> Within twelve minutes we were over the outskirts of Le Havre . It was 9 a.m. when we broke the sound barrier-Mach 1 . Up there it comes with a whimper , not a bang . I had to be told that we had passed Mach 1 cruising at 30,000 feet ; we felt only a slight whisper of movement , hardly a shudder , as the plane continued to climb . <P> At 9:15 a.m. we were at Mach 1.9 and still picking up speed ; 9:16 and ten seconds ... 20 ... 25 . The pilot raised his thumb in a gesture of triumph . A few seconds later we were flying at twice the speed of sound - which , at our altitude of 50,000 ft. , came to nearly 1,300 miles an hour . <P> At this height , I leaned over and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may never see again . Cobalt blue at the edge of my sight , deepening and darkening as my eyes slid upward . No clouds here , no mist or haze . Cruising at Mach 2 , ten miles above the earth , the plane probably has less vibration than a normal jet and the same interior noise level . The Concorde is narrow and somewhat claustrophobic , which may make it uncomfortable for some . But for me that feeling paled before the mind-boggling way in which it shrank the world . <P> Forty-two minutes and 630 miles out of Paris , the Concorde tilted in a graceful left turn toward home . If we had continued on course directly west , we would have been in New York in less than two hours . <P> The pilot dropped back into subsonic flight . Again , no jolts or jars . The Concorde came home as smoothly as it went out , with its crazy tilt on touchdown ; the rear wheels banged onto the runway , and the nose followed seconds later . We had been in the air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1,425 miles . <P> <P> The experience of flying at literally twice the speed of sound was more dramatic in what did not happen than in what did . My neck did not snap on takeoff , nor did I require a straitjacket to remain in my seat . The plane did not jerk its way up in roller-coaster fashion or plunge straight to the earth for landing . 1 had a feeling of rather unsettling normalcy .
