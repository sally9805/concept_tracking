txt July 31 is the last day on which New York City may file a formal request to be designated by the United States Olympic Committee as host city for the 1984 Summer Games . In the few days left , Mayor Beame , surely in consultation with Governor Carey , must decide whether to let the date go by without action or to try for the designation . An impressive list of negative factors can oe set nowt ' against the effort . The preparations for the Games would be long and costly . The Games themselves last only 15 confused , crowded , hectic , perhaps even dangerous days . The tourist income from this brief period would be comparatively negligible . The permanent installations for the Olympic events would be of only marginal value to New York City . The possibility of cost overruns might hurt the city 's relations with its bond buyers . On the positive side , the list is less tangible but nonetheless compelling . After three years of gloomy retrenchment , designation of New York as host to the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constructive and attainable , which would unleash its people 's energies . The exhilarating experiences of Operation Sail and the 1970 Democratic National Convention demonstrated the value of such events to civic morale . The international notice that New York City attracted then may well be connected with the influx of foreign investment capital today , and with the surge in office rentals in prime areas . The joy of sports and the thrill of competition cut acru , s national and racial cultures . Preparing for the Olympiad would spur rediscovery by New Yorkers of their city 's immense assets . Matching the city and the Olympics is irresistible : Both symbolize the idea that merit canr:t be defined by language , race or national origin , but only by performance . So we favor making a good try for the designation . Prudence , however , dictates that the Mayor and the Governor satisfy themselves as to the accuracy of the study made at their request by Richard Ravitch , former chairman of the Urban Development Corporation . New York is rich in facilities for spectator sports but lacks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Ravitch proposal is to build an addition to Shea Stadium in the east parking lot , connecting it by temporary stands to the present stadium . After the Games , the addition would be joined to the existing structure , increasing the stadium 's football seating capacity . The study also proposes building an Olympic swimming complex on the site of the former United States pavilion in Flushing Meadow Park and a rowing course at Pelham Bay Lagoon . Athletes would be housed in an Olympic Village , built on Roosevelt Island with government mortgage insurance , and available for permanent housing after the Games . These proposals have been both challenged and defended . The Mayor and Governor must now make their own rapid appraisal . ? The Ravitch report predicts that constructing these facilities and running the Summer Games will cost $225 million more than expected proceeds . New York City obviously is in no position to cover the expected deficits or to Make the required investments long before any receipts are in hand . It appears conceivable , however , that the state can provide much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ benefit of a successful Olympiad inures to the whole nation . It will be the United States , not New York , that enters the team . Neither President Carter nor Congressional leaders can make a firm commitment as to the extent of future United States Olympic participation , but more than $100 million in Federal help has already been given to Lake Placid for the 1980 Winter Games . An acknowledgement Of Washington 's interest in helping out with the costs of the 1984 Olympics , wherever in the United States they may be held , would be comforting . New York City , we believe , would be a superlative host to the 1984 Games . Recognizing that the city might be disappointed in the competition for designation , and recognizing the problems that success in that competition would bring , we , along with many other New Yorkers , find ourselves drawn to the future rather than to the past , to the energizing and even exciting pursuit of excellence symbolized by the Olympics .              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
