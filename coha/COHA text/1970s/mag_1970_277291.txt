At 39 , Bridget Riley has had more than her share of misunderstanding . Few painters have been so ruthlessly plagiarized by commerce . As soon as her tightly organized , black-and-white abstractions began to wrench and prick the eyes of an international public in the mid- ' 60s , a horde of fabric designers and window dressers moved in . Riley , along with other painters like Vasarely and Soto , became synonymous with Op art ; and Op itself became , in the hands of its exploiters , a chic gimmick that could market anything from underwear to wallpaper . By the summer of 1965 , it seemed that every boutique in the West had its own coarse versions of Bridget Riley 's optical dazzle . <P> The fad set up a backlash among serious critics : Were her paintings any more than a game with the retina ? Indeed , they were ; and the proof is a full-scale retrospective , opening this week at the Kunstverein in Hannover , Germany . <P> Painter Riley 's development spans a ten-year arc from the aggressiveness of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new stripe paintings as Apprehend , 1970 . First reactions to her work may run from puzzlement to nausea . But Riley has always denied she means to hurt the eyes , aiming only for " a stimulating , an active , a vibrating pleasure . " But not relaxation - the pleasure is existential , a tuning of the consciousness . In a picture like Cataract III , the eye has no resting place . The viewer scans the inexorably waving lines with something akin to mounting panic , until the heaving surface can no longer be experienced as a flat plane . All that contradicts the eye 's movement , and stabilizes it , is a swell of color intensity-turquoise and red coming out of gray and fading back again . The effect of such images is more akin to revelation than illusion , for it seems barely credible that so much energy could be contained in one pattern . <P> Cold Shower . Bridget Riley 's paintings are nearly always made of such a formal unit-dot or stripe or ellipse-repeated and multiplied with tiny changes of position , tone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then it peaks , like a laser emitting its stored energy in one flash . The serial changes ( which may be no more than the slow rotation of a geometric " blip " of paint , happening a thousand times on one canvas ) subvert , and at last explode , what would otherwise be a rigid order . " Everybody lives through states of disintegration but then finds something stronger that ca n't be disintegrated , " she says . " The word ' paradox ' has always had a kind of magic for me , and I think my pictures have a paradoxical quality , a paradox of chaos and order in one . " <P> Her search for what can not be disintegrated is intense , forcing the viewer to re-examine that perilous equilibrium we like to call normality . " We have to submit to the attack in the way we have to learn to enjoy a cold shower-bath , " wrote Bridget Riley 's admirer and mentor , the perceptual psychologist Anton Ehrenzweig .
