Nearly a century has passed since Louis Pasteur developed the first effective vaccine against rabies , but the dangerous viral disease still takes hundreds of lives round the world every year . The problem is especially serious in developing countries , where inoculations are not always quickly available and infected animals , who transmit the disease through bites , often run rampant . Yet even when bitten people are vaccinated in time , the treatment can be almost as bad as the disease . Typically , it involves a series of 14 or more shots ( usually in the abdomen ) that often cause painful allergic swelling and occasionally paralysis or death . <P> Now a remarkable new vaccine , which World Health Organization officials describe as a " fantastic breakthrough " in the campaign against rabies , has passed another milestone test . Writing in the Journal of the American Medical Association , a team of U.S. and Iranian doctors last week reported that they recently administered the vaccine in a series of only six shots to 45 Iranians who had been bitten by rabid animals-nine by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ developed rabies or showed a severe allergic reaction . Reason : the new vaccine , unlike the old , is cultured in human rather than animal cells . Thus , while the patients develop antibodies against rabies , they do not suffer painful reactions to the foreign animal protein . <P> A decade in development by Philadelphia 's Wistar Institute , the vaccine is licensed only for clinical trials in the U.S. But the latest results , following a similarly successful test in West Germany , should hasten the day when it is sanctioned by the Food and Drug Administration for any American who has been nipped by a possibly rabid animal .
