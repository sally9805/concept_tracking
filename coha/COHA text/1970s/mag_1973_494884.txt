Power from the Sun Harry Thomason , a patriotic but distant neighbor of the President in Washington , DC says he has n't turned down his thermostat to save fuel this winter , and does n't need to . If he did it would hardly affect his heating bill . Last summer he filled his fuel tank with $55 worth of heating oil at low pre-crisis rates , and now he thinks his reserves will last until next summer . His secret is solar power . Without it , he thinks his fuel bill this year would have been about $300 . At the moment Thomason 's oil furnace is disconnected because he wants to find out how long he can do without it , and his house is being warmed to about 70 degrees , day and night , with heat from the sun alone . An apparatus designed and built by Thomason collects solar heat on the roof and carries it to the basement , where it is stored in a 1600-gallon tub of water surrounded by stones . When the temperature in his house falls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air from the house through the warm stones and back upstairs until the temperature rises a few degrees . Even on the coldest days , Thomason says , his system collects some solar heat . Its only real enemy is clouds ; if it were n't for them , he would n't need an oil tank at all . He claims that even if the sun shone every second day , he could heat his house without fuel . But bad weather comes in clumps , and after three or four moderately cool , cloudy days , or two windy dark ones , his system is forced to fall back on the standby , oil heat . The principle of solar heating is simple , and dozens of experimenters have been lured over the years into thinking they could heat their houses cheaply with it . But very few experiments have paid off . The difficulty is not just designing a system that works , but designing one that is also easy to build . If one could afford to buy photoelectric cells at several hundred dollars per square foot , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on solar electricity . But to generate the amount of electricity and heating power used in a year , say 24,000 kilowatts , the roof would have to be covered with 800 square feet of photocells , at a cost that would run into the tens of thousands . Even if photocells could be produced for a dollar per square foot , as solar expert Karl Btier at the University . of Delaware thinks they can be , a solar electric house would be prohibitively expensive . Boer estimates that a house drawing 80 percent of its power from solar electricity and solar heat , built with mass-produced materials , would still cost $3000 more than a conventionally heated house . This is why most research in solar electricity is considered merely experimental . The day may come when it costs more to buy electricity from the power company than to make it at home , but that day is not in sight . Boer 's estimate that houses with solar electric power could be mass-produced in the ' 70s still seems optimistic , but every increase in the price of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment solar power is useful only in the thermal field , and as Thomason has discovered , it 's much more adaptable to heating than to air conditioning . There was a boom in solar house-building in the US in 1958-1959 when many experimental heaters were put into operation . But few of them survived . One of the more promising among them , built in 1959 by MIT after 20 years of experimenting , fell apart three years later . At its peak it collected 55 percent of its heat from the sun . That gives an idea of the difficulties involved . Two that have survived from that period are a 1958 house built by Colorado State University Professor George Li5f and a vintage 1959 house built by Thomason , the prototype of the house referred to earlier . The Liif house gets only 25 to 33 percent of its heat from the sun , according to one of LOf 's assistants , because it has an undersized heat collector and storage area . Thomason has built three solar houses now , and claims that his last two get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more advanced in the use of solar tap water heating , they have not gone as far in space heating . Solar hot water heaters are common in Israel and Australia , and until this year solar heat research was more generously funded in those countries and in Russia and France than in the US . But now , it need hardly be said , interest is reviving . Besides those mentioned already , today there are solar heated ( and some solar cooled ) houses in California , New Mexico , Oregon and elsewhere , making a total of perhaps a dozen . The University of Delaware opened a laboratory solar house last summer that runs partly on solar generated electricity , and the University of Florida has a solar heated and air conditioned test house . Others are being built in Omaha , Arizona and Colorado . A New York engineering firm is working on plans for two possible solar heated and cooled , federal government buildings , one scheduled to go up in Michigan and the other in New Hampshire . The Massachusetts Audubon Society has commissioned Arthur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heating and cooling system for its new library , and office building in Lincoln , Mass. , construction for which will begin near the end of next year . Arthur D. Little estimates that the system will handle 65 to 85 percent of the heating load and 50 percent of the air conditioning . If mass-produced , it is estimated that the system would add $31,000 to the price of a building like the Audubon center , which will be two storeys high with floor space of 8000 feet . The apparent key to the success of the Thomason houses is the large size of the heat collecting and storage devices , made possible by the inexpensive materials used . Unlike the more careful university experimenters , Thomason does not use expensive copper or aluminum piping in his rooftop heat collector , but a sheet of black , corrugated aluminum . On top he has bolted dozens of rectangles of cheap glass to keep the heat in . Whenever the temperature of the metal sheet is warm enough , the system automatically begins pumping reserve water from the basement to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along a gutter and into the basement tank . In good weather the water downstairs stays at a temperature of about 85 to 95 degrees . The tank and surrounding stones take up a third of the basement . Though it seems to work , Thomason 's system is treated as a freak . A survey called " Solar Energy as a Natural Resource " published this year with grants supplied by the National Scierie Foundation and NASA speaks of solar space heating as being nearly competitive with conventional fuel , possibly ready for public use in five years . It is easy to understand why the experts have n't recognized Thomason 's work . His system is an amateur job , and he does n't keep statistical data on its cost or performance . Thomason himself is not an engineer ( he calls himself Dr. Thomason , but his doctorate is in law , earned in night school ) , and his equipment is crude and theoretically impure . Its flaw is that while it works as a solar heater , it fails as a solar cooler . It provides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but it provides it in a fairly conventional way . The ideal system should be able to heat and cool with solar power , and to do so at a lower cost than present systems . According to a Student of solar energy in Colorado , the experts are sensitive about the number of solar houses that have failed , and are understandably cautious about endorsing anything that has n't got scientific credentials . Several large corporations are showing an interest in solar energy , among them General Electric , Westinghouse , TRW , Inc. and United Aircraft . The government , too , has begun to take a serious look : federal research funds have tripled since last year to $3.96 million , and they 're expected to triple again in 1974 to about $13.2 million . The Atomic Energy COmmission has asked the White House to spend even more , as much as $32 million next year alone . Solar experts , anxious to rid the field of any crankish overtones , will not spend the new money on an idea that has n't proved itself in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In , the meantime Harry Thomason is promoting his invention as fast as possible . Last week he bought $4000 worth of ads in Washington papers inviting " builders , developers and investors " to the " most profitable seminar you 'll ever . attend " to learn about " one of the smartest investments of our time . " He claims that a system of the size used in his house can be installed in a new building for $3000 ( roughly twice the cost of conventional heating and cooling ) , possibly as much as $4500 if construction costs are more than he expects . At present oil prices , with no major repairs , such a system would pay for itself in seven to 15 years .
