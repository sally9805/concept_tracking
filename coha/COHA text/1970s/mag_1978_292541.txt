Legal aid hits the road <P> In most big cities , small consumers complaining to service stations and businesses about slipshod auto repairs or faulty appliances as often as not might as well hoot at the moon . Many do not know about consumer complaint agencies or how to bring a small claims suit . The idea of hiring a lawyer is intimidating , and the legal fees involved in pressing a claim often turn out to be larger than the possible rewards . But in San Francisco , gypped citizens can bring their consumer gripes to a baby-blue 1953 van operated by the city-getting advice , and often redress , for absolutely nothing . <P> Known as the Complaint-Mobile , the van tours San Francisco , displaying a big sign asking : HAVE YOU BEEN RIPPED OFF ? Men and women volunteers in the district attorney 's **33;8044;TOOLONG unit listen to the complaints of passersby , then mediate with merchants , doctors and the Like . Most complaints concern car repairs ; others range from false advertising to ill-fitting hairpieces . One woman complained of a backache @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bust size . No complaint is too small : the unit once got back a 200 soda-bottle deposit for a small boy from his neighborhood grocer . <P> The Complaint-Mobile hit the road more than a year ago as a result of a $35,000 Law Enforcement Assistance Administration grant and an overage truck donated by United Parcel . It handled over 300 complaints in its first year , recovering $7,500 in restitutions . The Complaint-Mobile has received HEW funding for next year , and will add a small claims court educational project to its list of van services . <P> All of the volunteer Complaint-Mobile workers are nonlawyers . But , as Volunteer Ernie Wallerstein points out , just being able to " mention the D.A . ' s office gives you clout . " Explains former Assistant District Attorney Ray Bonner , 36 , who originally conceived the Complaint-Mobile project : " Many people simply ca n't afford lawyers , and they do n't need them . They simply have to demand their rights . Most businesses know that people do not complain and even if they do , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're just helping them get what they should be able to get for themselves . This is a government program that works , and it works without clogging the courts . "
