Too much of a miracle ? <P> Forget aspirin , penicillin or tranquilizers . The true wonder drug , in the eyes of all too many people , is one that promotes weight loss . For a while amphetamines seemed to provide that miracle , until doctors began warning of their severe side effects , which include increased blood pressure and heart rate , a dependency on the drugs , and bouts of depression when the pills are withdrawn . Now magical diet potions are being promoted in a new and , according to some doctors , alarming form . To make matters worse , they can be had for the asking at almost any drug counter . <P> These widely advertised nonprescription products contain two familiar ingredients , benzocaine and phenylpropanolamine ( PPA ) . Benzocaine is a local anesthetic that has long been used to soothe skin irritations and itching . Added to special chewing gums or candy , it presumably dulls the taste buds and discourages eating . PPA , a drug related to the amphetamines , has enjoyed a long history as a nasal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Dexatrim , Prolamine , Spantrol and Appedrine ( which also contain caffeine ) , manufacturers say that it depresses the brain 's " appetite center " in the hypothalamus . <P> But do the drugs really work ? Yes , say the pharmaceutical houses , which got strong support earlier this year from a special advisory panel to the Food and Drug Administration . After reviewing drug company data , the study group found that benzocaine and PPA apparently were " safe and effective . " It was a tentative finding , to be sure , and must still be accepted by the FDA , but manufacturers pressed ahead with intensified ad campaigns . <P> Yet many doctors are unconvinced by the blitz . The Medical Letter , a highly regarded bulletin for physicians , notes that in one published study of 66 obese patients , the greatest weight loss was achieved not by anyone on PPA but by someone who had been given a placebo . Says Letter Consulting Editor Dr. Martin Rizack : " If somebody really wants to lose weight , you can give them almost anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ especially concerned because people can obtain PPA without prescriptions . The drug companies themselves acknowledge that it should not be taken by anyone with heart disease , hypertension , diabetes or thyroid disease . These conditions often afflict the overweight , in many instances without their knowledge . PPA , alone or together with other drugs , such as monoamine oxidase inhibitors ( antidepressants ) or indomethacin ( an antiarthritic ) , can induce severe episodes of hypertension . There has also been a case of kidney failure in a woman who had been taking a PPA preparation for a few weeks along with a few tablets of aspirin and acetaminophen . <P> Most specialists still feel that the real answer to shedding pounds is changing lifestyles . Says Dr. Victor Vertes , director of the weight loss clinic at Cleveland 's Mt . Sinai Hospital : " These drugs are not going to burn calories . You 've got to curb your caloric intake . And for long-term weight control , they 're completely useless . You ca n't take them for the rest of your life . "  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
