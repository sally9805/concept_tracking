MY LAI 4 by Seymour M. Hersh. 210 pages . Random House . $5.95 . <P> ONE MORNING IN THE WAR by Richard Hammer . 207 pages . Coward-McCann. $5.95 . <P> <P> When news of the massacre broke last November , most Americans at first refused to believe that it had happened . When the basic facts became incontestable , many people still considered them too mundane to merit such a fuss or thought the whole thing ought to be kept quiet so as not to comfort the enemy . Anyone who can read these two books and still cling to either view has lost all sensibility or is beyond the reach of the written word . <P> Both books bring the horror back with new impact . And both are based on the reports of many witnesses whose willingness to incriminate themselves lends credence to their testimony . Hersh , a freelance Washington journalist who has just won a Pulitzer Prize for his effort , places the number of dead at between 450 and 500 . Describing the murderous mood of the U.S. troops , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a knife ; others stood around watching a G.I. slaughter a cow with a bayonet . A G.I. with an M-16 rifle fired at two young boys walking along a road . The older of the two-about seven or eight years old-fell over the first to protect him . The G.I. kept on firing until both were dead . " Hammer quotes a U.S. soldier who watched one of his friends hurl a grenade into a group of ten women and children : " You could hear the screams and then the sound and then see the pieces of bodies scatter out , and the whole area just suddenly turned red like somebody had turned on a faucet . " Why did n't he stop his buddy ? " All you had to do was take one look at his face . I think if I had even said a word to him at all , he would have turned and killed me and not thought a damn thing about it . " <P> Chasing G.I.s . To get the original story , Hersh doggedly pursued a tip from a friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extent of the massacre-initially through the obscure Dispatch News Service . He logged some 50,000 air miles chasing ex-G.I.s for their versions . In pinpointing the involvement of Charlie Company 's officers , including Captain Ernest Medina and Lieut . William Galley Jr. , he names the accusing witnesses and scrupulously uses no anonymous quotes . His book bluntly lays out much of the prosecution 's case in the impending military trials . He even had access to some reports of the Army 's Criminal Investigating Division. *
