txt For the first time in U.S. history , a committee of Congress has opened hearings on federal spending as a whole , and immediately faced a controversy over a basic issue in the nation 's economic crisis . Kenneth Rush , counselor to the President for economic policy , outlining President Ford 's views , called inflation America 's " No. 1 problem " and outlined a policy of fiscal and monetary restraint , reduced federal expenditures , and a balanced budget in fiscal year 1976 . But Gardner Ackley , chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under Presidents Kennedy and Johnson ; declared that worsening business , farm , and labor conditions make the economy , rather than inflation , the No. 1 problem , and publicly switched his former position . He previously had advocated federal budget cuts , he said , but now he opposed them . He might also favor stimulative tax cuts , he said , which Mr. Rush strongly opposed . Headed by Muskie The newly created Senate Budget Committee met here for a historic first under the chairmanship of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other Senators . Majority views appeared weighted toward the fiscal restraint advocated by Mr. Rush . The latter linked federal spending with double-digit inflation and declared " deficit spending is one of the major causes of our current inflation . " His views , he said , reflected those of President Ford . He advocated a " policy of fiscal responsibility that will restrain the growth of demand by controlling federal spending . " // *First Senate budget hearings ; experts split // He urged Congress to pass the pending trade bill and legislation to set up a new Cost of Living Council that would " monitor wages and prices to expose abusive increases . " Like President Ford , Mr. Rush cited the announced jump in General Motors prices as an example of the " abuses . " He opposed mandatory powers for the proposed council or any wage and price controls . Ackley backs Rush Mr. Ackley , mild-mannered University of Michigan professor , joined Mr. Rush in favoring a Cost of Living Council . He strongly objected , however , to slashing federal expenditures at present . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ billion will be cut by $5 billion or $10 billion . Mr. Rush favors this ; Mr. Ackley opposes it . " I urge the committee not to recommend such a reduction , " the latter said . " Indeed , I urge that the Congress should feel free to consider either modest additions to the budget or else some modest reduction in taxation . " Last June , Mr. Ackley said , he wrote Sen. Walter F. Mondale ( D ) of Minnesota opposing the latter 's tax cut proposal . But the prospect of 6 percent unemployment and steadily worsening economic conditions have changed his mind . Inflation threat admitted Mr. Ackley acknowledged that inflation is worsening and is " almost frightening . " But the federal budget , he argued , is not responsible for the worsening inflation . The combined expenditures of Washington , the states and local governments has declined , he said , relative to the size of total output . The very first meeting of the new budget committee , thus ran into violent disagreement among experts . Conservative members of the Muskie committee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ criticized White House advisers Herbert Stein and Alan Greenspan and urged President Ford to listen instead to Arthur Burns of the Federal Reserve System . He supported possible new wage  --  price controls , despite what he called the " incredible botch " which the Nixon administration made of them . Mr. Rush declared , " I believe the situation requires a sustained program of moderate fiscal and monetary restraint combined with specific government actions to improve the productivity of our system . " He urged a " concerted , cooperative move toward fiscal responsibility , " to meet the crisis .
