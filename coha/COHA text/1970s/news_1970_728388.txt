txt Publication of the first authoritative estimates of the cost of Britain 's joining the European Common Market has pushed the great debate over Europe to full intensity . " Americans want a united Europe , " one American in London assured this correspondent . " But I must say in Washington today there are some doubts about the wisdom of building up a strong new area of discrimination at this moment against our farmers and manufacturers . " " Without the Common Market 's enlargement  --  if Britain and the others do n't join  --  it will break up , " declared a European observer from Brussels . " They must join . But we sometimes wonder , if they do , will Britain immediately block the path to political unity ? " I do n't see what good it is going to do developing countries like ours if we lose our Commonwealth preferences , " said an Indian journalist . ( These preferences provide duty-free entry in Britain for many products , including manufactures . British entry means Commonwealth countries will lose them . ) Different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  there is likely to be quite a heavy economic price to pay all round for British entry in the short term . It is a price not demanded from the original six  --  Belgium , France , Italy , Luxembourg , the Netherlands , and West Germany  --  because of their quite different situations . What will be important in 1970 , it may be argued , will be if the countries of Western Europe agree to the greatest and widest possible unity , not the immediate effect on British consumers , or even Commonwealth producers , or particular American exporters . The point was put in a different way by a young man whose car bears the flags of the nations of Europe in a bold ellipse encircling the golden letters " EU " ? for " Europe Unie . " " It will be the greatest thing , " he said , " the positive thing , something to get excited for . " Britain falling behind But a majority of Britons think like the housewife who said : " If the price of food is going up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Or the reader who telephoned to say she wanted to settle an argument . " If we join , will we or will we not have to sign the Treaty of Rome ? " she asked . " I do n't know whether a British minister will actually sign the piece of paper , " I replied . " But Britain will have to accept every line of the treaty and all that has been decided since . " " Thank you , " she replied , in a very firm tone . " Now I know exactly where I stand . " Others say that if there is no move toward a United States of Europe , at least in a nonfederal sense , then most of the major arguments except one are definitely against Britain 's joining . That one is put by George Thomson , Britain 's " minister for Europe . " " In 1958 we were better off per head than any country in the European communities except Luxembourg , " he points out . " Now we are worse off than any except Italy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Common Market average in 1958 was $955 per head . In 1968 it was $2,048 per head . The equivalent United Kingdom figures were $1,248 and $1,855 . " The Common Market has worked for its members . The organization we want to join has been a success . " Greater market beckons It is also a fact that the European Free Trade Association ( EFTA ) , formed in 1959 as a partner for the European Economic Community , has triggered a great explosion of trade among its members . Britain has gained less from this than the other seven members ( the Scandinavian countries , Austria , Switzerland , and Portugal ) . One reason may well be that the EFTA has added an enormously greater market to the home markets of the others but has added only a smaller market to Britain 's . The others gained 55 million from Britain alone to add to their tiny markets . Britain has gained only 40 million to add to its big one . But joining a Common Market of 10 countries means enlarging Britain 's 55 million by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advantages of scale to be reaped in trade , industry , technology , agriculture , and possibly environmental control . Barriers to remove But the immediate cost is high . ' ' There will be a switch to high-cost food . There will be the proceeds of levies and customs duties to pay to the European Community . There will be the value-added tax to impose , which for a time will also raise prices . There will be tariff barriers against European goods to sweep away , allowing in more and cheaper imports . There will be immigration barriers against European citizens to remove , too . There will be Commonwealth preferences to sacrifice . There will be duties to put on the goods of old friends whose products at present come into Britain duty free . The effects of what is contemplated now will be virtually irrevocable . First a portentous choice has to be made . It will be as profoundly important as any made in Europe in 100 years . Then , if it is for entry , the immediate disadvantages have to be minimized while the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are maximized . If it is once more against entry , then some other urgent action would have to be taken . For Western Europe would have to be saved somehow from a new and grave political crisis .
