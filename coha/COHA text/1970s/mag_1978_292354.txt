Carter shows new skill , Arabs play it cool <P> At the end , the battle over the Middle East plane deal turned into one of the most bruising Washington lobbying fights in years . Operating with growing confidence , the President and his top aides turned in their most skillful selling job on the Senate so far . The emerging Arab lobby displayed surprising sophistication and shrewdness . The Jewish lobby responded massively , but was undercut by confused signals from Jerusalem , as well as by some indecision in its own ranks , and it suffered a rare loss in Congress . <P> Carter repeatedly had such high officials as Secretary of State Cyrus Vance and Defense Secretary Harold Brown work on key Senators . He enlisted the help of former President Gerald Ford and former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger , as well as that of Nelson and David Rockefeller . In closed Senate hearings , State Department experts spread out maps with Saudi Arabia 's Soviet-influenced neighbors inked in red-an appeal particularly effective with Republican Senators most worried about Russian moves in the Horn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ State Warren Christopher 's testimony on the Hill was crucial as he reported a dialogue held last month between Vance and Israel 's Moshe Dayan . If the choice for Israel came down to getting the whole package killed , thereby losing its own new planes , or seeing Egypt and Saudi Arabia get aircraft too , which did it prefer ? Recalled Christopher : " Dayan said they would rather have all the sales than to have none . " <P> Even when Senate approval of the package seemed assured , Carter did not let up . In the final days before the vote , especially over the weekend , he worried about the potential impact of last-minute pro-Israel lobbying . The President once again telephoned at least two dozen Senators , including many Republicans , to plead that they stay with the package . In political terms the result was ironic . Despite Republican National Chairman Bill Brock 's insistence that his party could use the issue to undermine the usual Jewish support of the Democratic Party , G.O.P. Senators voted 26 to 11 for Carter 's position , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carter won with rare help from such conservatives as Barry Goldwater , Strom Thurmond , John Tower and Sam Hayakawa . <P> Saudi Arabia 's successful drive was masterminded by Frederick Dutton , an experienced Washington hand who once lobbied on the Hill for Jack Kennedy . <P> <P> Dutton , who has promoted Saudi causes since 1975 , worked closely with the National Association of Arab Americans , an increasingly effective 2,000-member lobby . Both Dutton and his key associate , Public Relations Consultant Crawford Cook , tried to play down their influence . Said Cook : " I 'm certain that the vote would not have gone the way it did had the Administration not been as strong on this issue as it was . "
