Last week , after more than three weeks of floor debate , President Carter 's windfall profits tax on domestic oil producers finally neared passage by the Senate . As we went to press , approval was no longer in doubt , though some of the details remained to be settled . The House gave Carter everything he wanted and then some last June , but the Senate ? primarily in the person of Finance Committee chairman Russell Long ? took great liberties with the bill , increasing the tax in a couple of ways , but decreasing it in others . The tax is a sound one , and its enactment is a genu ? ine legislative victory for President Carter . Neverthe ? less , Carter also is partly to blame for some of the defects in the final version of the tax , because of his failure to explain its purpose honestly and clearly . This should not be a measure to punish the big oil companies because they are evil , or just because they are big . It is an attempt to recapture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go to American private individuals and corporations ? not because of anything ( good or evil ) they themselves have done , but because of the OPEC oil monopoly . Carter proposed the windfall tax last April at the same time he announced his intention to phase out price controls on domestically produced crude oil . Currently there is a price ceiling of six dollars a barrel on oil from wells discovered before 1973 , and a ceiling of $13 on oil from wells discovered between 1973 and 1978 . There are no price controls on oil discovered after 1978 and a few other special categories . The logic of price controls on domestic oil ( which President Nixonretained when lifting his general price control system ) is that we ca n't avoid paying monopoly prices to OPEC but we need n't pay them to our own fellow citizens . But there is an illogic of price controls too . They mislead consumers into thinking that oil is cheaper than it really is . When consumers are deciding whether to use that extra gallon of gasoline , they should be forced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it comes from abroad and costs $23 or more . Averaging in the cost of cheap domestic oil disguises this fact and leads to excess consumption . Worse , domestic price controls discourage domestic oil production . It makes no sense to import oil for $23 if someone can produce it here for $22.50 . But that someone wo n't bother if he or she ca n't sell it for more than six dollars or $13 . On the other hand , even with price controls the United States produces about as much oil every day as Saudi Arabia . So obviously there is plenty of domestic oil that can be profitably produced for a lot less than OPEC charges , and there 's no reason to let domestic producers join in the OPEC extortion . The proper purpose of a windfall profits tax is to get the conservation and incentive effects of decontrol , without letting domestic oil producers get OPEC-level profits on oil it costs them much less to produce . It 's important to understand why this tax is necessary . It will have no direct effect on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full of fortuitous windfalls that do n't get taxed away , such as the increase in the value of your house or the family silver . But this particular windfall to certain Americans results from hostile actions by foreign governments that are imposing great distress and sacrifice on other Americans . The government is perfectly justified in attempting to even the score . Furthermore , the largest domestic oil producers also deal with OPEC on our behalf , so it is a wise precaution to try to restrain their interest in seeing OPEC succeed . It 's also important to understand why the oil company arguments against the tax are invalid . They argue , in their ads , that the tax will discourage domestic energy production by making it unprofitable and by siphoning off the capital they need to pay for it . But a properly designed tax will not discourage new oil production since it will apply only to oil that is already profitably produced at the control price . Naturally it would be nice for the oil companies if they could supply their capital needs with free money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put up money for energy development , at the usual rates . The good part of President Carter 's original proposal last April was a straightforward and modest attempt to capture less than half of the windfall from decontrol . After a phasing-in period , there would be a tax per barrel of previously controlled oil , set at 50 percent of the difference between $13 and the world price . The base price would be adjusted upward with inflation , and the whole thing would be phased out by 1990 . Oil extracted from old wells by certain expensive tech ? niques would be treated like newly discovered oil that had never been controlled . This tax would raise billions of dollars without any effect on the incentive to increase domestic production . The bad part of Carter 's original bill was a tax on newly discovered domestic oil , and other oil that had never been under price controls . It would be set at half the difference between $16 ( adjusted for inflation ) and the world price . Carter called this , rather lamely , an " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was a tax on OPEC . In fact it would be a present to OPEC , by undermining the goal of decontrol . This tax would make it unprofitable for domestic producers to try to undersell OPEC unless they could undersell it by three or four dollars a barrel today , and more in the future . This part of the tax turned Carter 's proposal from a sensible reclaiming of windfalls into an act of vengeance on oil companies , for unspecified crimes . The other flaw in Carter 's proposal was his insistence on spending the revenues primarily to force-feed the development of expensive alternative fuels ? mainly synthetic oil from coal and shale , but including every ? thing from photovoltaic solar cells to windmills . Most of these energy sources , especially the $88-billion synfuels program , look like a poor return for the huge amount of money Carter wants to invest . ( See " Synfuel Madness , " TNR , July 21 &; 28 , and " Sunlight and Moonshine , " TNR , October 27 . ) By the proper logic of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those who are suffering the most from high energy prices . The House Ways and Means Committee began the process of congressional fiddling with Carter 's proposal . It increased the tax on pre-1973 oil from 50 percent to 70 percent , and on 1973-78 oil from 50 percent to 60 percent . It raised the base price for the new oil tax from $16 to $17 , and arranged for it to rise faster than inflation , thus reducing that chunk of future revenue . But then it raised the tax from 50 percent to 70 percent for oil sold above $26 . On the floor , the House reduced this last item to 60 percent . The point of the tax was rapidly becoming obscure . In the Senate it disappeared completely . What had been a reasonably simple proposal became an incredibly complicated one in passing through the Senate Finance Committee . The committee made two wise changes in the House bill . It eliminated the tax on newly discovered oil , thus removing the disincentive for new exploration and production . It also separated the tax from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , allowing each to be debated on its own merits . Then the committee started looking for oil to exempt from the tax . It exempted the first 100 barrels a day produced by " in ? dependents " ( companies that do no refining or marketing ) from very small wells . ( On the floor this exemption was expanded to include 1000 barrels a day from any well . ) Then the committee exempted all oil owned by state and local governments , a con ? cession to Russell Long , whose state owns a lot of oil . And it exempted all oil owned by Indian tribes , Alaska natives , and non ? profit schools and medical in ? stitutions . To make up all the money lost through these exemptions , the committee raised the tax on pre-1973 oil from wells to 75 percent . At one point the committee found it had approved tax credits for various energy-related expenses ( storm windows , etc. ) that added up to more than the estimated revenue from the tax that was expected to replace the lost money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tax credits , but simply by making its revenue estimate more optimistic . On the floor , the Senate left most of the exemptions alone , but voted to raise the tax on oil from 1973-78 wells to 75 percent . It appeared last week that the Senate also would add a new " minimum tax " on new oil to replace the " OPEC tax " that Carter proposed , the House passed , and the Finance Committee killed . Then the bill goes to conference . The two chief defects of the tax , as its final contours begin to emerge , are that it applies to future oil discoveries , on which there is no real windfall , and that it is riddled with senseless exemptions . Both defects result in part from the confusion created by Carter 's inflamed rhetoric about the oil companies . The logic of the exemptions seems to be that just because you want to punish big oil , you need n't also drag in more appealing sorts like Indians , schoolchildren , and " small " oil producers . The exemptions for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little people . In fact , the typical stockholder of an independent oil company is far less deserving of solicitude than the typical stockholder of one of the biggies . Pension funds and small investors buy Exxon stock ; independent oil companies generally are closely held by the rich . In any event , a windfall profits tax is designed to make difficult readjustments easier by reducing invidious distinctions between citizens . It should not be presented in a way that makes those distinctions more sharply felt . If his name had been Edward Moore , as Eddie McCormack bitterly observed in 1962 , his candidacy would have been a joke , " but nobody 's laughing . " And the situation has been much the same for all the 17 years since Edward Moore Kennedy , then only 29 , beat McCormack for the right to fill the US Senate seat of his brother , President John Kennedy . And even though Edward Kennedy has had probably as much public attention for all these years as any political figure except the various presidents , nobody 's really been looking and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other politicians , and most of the people have come to believe that some irresistible force , some historical or genetic inevitability , was operating to make Kennedy a candidate for president . The evidence suggests that Kennedy himself was of two minds about this supposed natural law of Kennedy ascendancy . He resisted strong pressures to run in 1972 and 1976 , all the while saying that his time might come , but later . This time , too , he held back at first , saying he expected President Carter to serve two terms and pronouncing himself eager to serve as chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee . If Kennedy was going to fun for president , it looked as though he thought of 1984 as his year . But he changed his mind . Why ? Kennedy says it was because of a fundamental disagreement with Presi ? dent Carter on vital issues ? energy , the economy , leadership of the country . These may have been what clinched his decision . But he would have to be on Mars not to be listening to the claque @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to be easy . The president 's poll ratings were down near 20 percent , as low as any incumbent 's have ever been . All the constituent groups of the Democratic party were mad at Carter . He had n't done much right either in foreign or domestic policy . People were going to go into the primary voting booths and take out their frustrations about the inflation rate and energy prices by voting for anybody but Carter . If it is n't you , Teddy , the claque proclaimed , it will be Jerry Brown or some nobody , and he certainly will be beaten by a Republican . If so you can forget about 1984 ? and who knows what the situation will be like in 1988 ? Kennedy 's staff members all deny that this logic prevailed upon him . They loyally declare that the issues are what got their boss into the race , and that dedication to his positions on the issues will sustain him through the hard going ahead . But the press and the public had the idea that Carter was hopelessly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Kennedy could n't be beat . Public opinion polls sustained those twin beliefs . In July , Gallup showed Kennedy 's support among Democrats at 54 percent to Carter 's 21 percent . Kennedy was far ahead of potential Republican challengers , while Carter was behind Reagan and Ford . Other polls showed Chappaquiddick was fading as a factor in people 's minds . Louis Harris said 67 percent of the people thought Kennedy had the right leadership traits to be president , while 71 percent doubted Carter had enough competence for the job . A CBS-New York Times poll showed that 55 percent of the people thought Kennedy showed good judgment under pressure , while 40 percent felt that way about Carter . Now Kennedy the presidential candidate is paying the price of being Edward Kennedy and not Edward Moore . Instead of being able to slog quietly around New Hampshire and Iowa and get his act together , like George McGovern , Jimmy Carter , George Bush , or any mortal candidate , he is expected to leap out of a phone       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
