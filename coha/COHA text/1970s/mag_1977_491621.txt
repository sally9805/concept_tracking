Normally by now I would be speaking to myself , roaring at the will to coherency . The silence I 've constrained myself to is difficult , striking , maddening . My imaginary crowd sits still in their corner shadows , their faces unseen . They know to watch my face and fingertips ; even when the phrases anger me I can not swear aloud . This is how I find it , to live in and by silence . Exterior silence is one thing , sheer will surmounts . But it is not enough . The realm of notions , the interior , is still ablaze with language . I wonder , and I can only wonder , how the Carmelite sisters endure . They are bent differently from me , an unassumable shape . The Carmelite monastery lies just across the road from the Veterans Hospital . It is modeled after the fortifications surrounding the town of Avila , Spain , in the sixteenth century , the significance being that the order was reformed , taken in a more ascetic direction by St. Theresa of Avila @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Cross , she and her followers , the Discalced ( barefoot ) Carmelites , took the order back to its original conception , as it was in the twelfth century . They joined in a community bound by the common desire for solitude , each member supported by the others on their highly personal way to God . They reached deep into scripture for a model and found Elias the Prophet , a man of 850 B.C. They took vows of poverty , celibacy and obedience , and lived prayer , fasting and ... silence . They ate and wore what they could afford . Time and scholarship have formalized their austerity . But the sisters wear shoes today ; they 'd have perished of pneumonia otherwise . It has been nearly two decades since I first began visiting the monastery . The visits were usually annual , made in the shank of summer , with my family . Later on , after high school , they were adventures alone . In recent years the pilgrimages have become less certain . The infrequency is not a measure of flagging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curiosity have less to do with my long skipping knowledge of the Carmelite 's life than the laughter of just one woman . My maternal Aunt Elizabeth , Sister Elizabeth , Aunt Betz , has been a Carmelite for nineteen years . She is the youngest of seven children , the runt of the litter too . Seems the older we get the more gangly and sallow I become while she gets steadily more frail and more a ringer for Grandma ; her skin grows translucent . Somehow , the instant she sees me I reduce her to waves of laughter , something to do with my uncouth days as a toddler , I imagine . Recently she was elected prioress of the twenty-two nuns . Ultimately , she is the key , the grace that brings me back here time and again . Each Carmelite monastery has an extraordinary amount of autonomy . As a result each has its own character , spirit and outlook on The Life . Some monasteries dwell in the unmodified continuity of the sixteenth century . Others , a small minority , have undergone extensive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carmelite monastery I visit is one of the latter , with many other monasteries in between . The differences , though , pale next to the common vein they share . For these women Carmelites are all astronomers of the Spirit . Astronomers spend their days plumbing the vastness of the heavens from isolated peaks far from the civilization they seek to serve through their science . Why do they need such odd , massive structures ? Why such distant posts ? Why such different telescopes : refracting , reflecting and radio ? As he turns from the eyepiece any astronomer will tell , " The structures are for the support and protection of our instruments . As for the distancing , the smoke , noise , widely varying temperature and city lights are all distractions . Our observations would mean nothing if they were imprecise . Each of the different telescopes , by its own distinct method , concentrates the image in its own way . Each gives its own view , its own revelation . " So too I think of the sisters as diviners of constellations within themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ microscope to their psyche ; rather , they search through the infinite vastness of their hearts and minds . All to know God as they know themselves . Yet we here on the outside speculate in our picayune way why the sisters limit the public access to them , why they live behind walls , stony and castellated . As though they were in hiding , as if they were immutable . How naive . With tidal interest I have watched the changes . I remember how the walls and iron bars appeared ghostly : solid , intense and redolent of medieval days . The monastery stood immensely high and elegant to my short eyes , in my toddling time , and sprawling , reaching out with the fourth and final wing of a construction that was begun in the late Twenties . On the greeting side of the building , foreboding as it is , there are two thick wooden doors . The one to the right opens into the chapel ; to the left is the entry into the public hall and rooms . Within is dim and cool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shallow steps to the hall , off to the right , is the turn room . At the doorway is a bell and cord . Once the bell was used to call the sister on duty , no more . The ringing would never carry deep enough as it once did when the monastery was smaller . A black button hooked to a buzzer calls throughout the cloistered halls . Chimes vs. practicality . As for the room itself , it is a simple cubicle , with skylight , two wicker seats , a wrought-iron cross and a window opposite the seats . The window is barely large enough to see a human face full view . To the left is a heavy wooden semicylinder set on a pivot in the wall , the turnstile . Through it passes much of the personal commerce , letters , packages , etc. , of the monastery . Objects appear and disappear in the revolving transit through the wall . Much is the same here , but here too is transformation . I remember how it used to be . There was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its little door . So the sister who answered the call remained unseen . Today there is neither metal nor cloth between the speaker and the seeker ; the door opens and there is a face answering out of the stone . Reaching ? Maybe . Anyway ... the waiting comes back to me , seeming interminable twixt the calling and hearing of a disembodied voice asking of me patience when I have none . Sister Rosemary , a nun for thirty years , remembers too . When they took away the curtain and grate it was a joyous occasion for me but a time of uncertainty for those behind the wall . As Sister Rosemary tells , " I was an old turn sister . I always had such confidence at the turn because I felt I was n't representing just myself but the other sisters as well . I could assure anyone who came there , anyone who was suffering , that all the sisters would remember them in their prayers . I had a lot of courage in that . " The first time I came there ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and it was just me . . . I felt as if I were naked . I just did n't like it . But God was good , because one of the first ones I saw was a woman who was n't saying anything , she was just crying . She would n't speak , and could n't tell me her problem . So I motioned to her to come to the window . She came very near , and I put my hand out and held her hand and prayed with her . . . for just a second . . . just a second . . . because I did n't know what the problem was . I just wanted to comfort her . . . and let her know that she was n't alone . That God was with her too , that there were three of us in the room . There were so few words spoken . . . yet she was really comforted . She had come from the hospital across the street where her husband had just died . . . it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prayers . That incident made me know how right that change was . " Sister Rosemary finishes her story ; her eyes sparkle and age falls away . I feel I 've dis78 THE // covered innocence , refined and discerni ng . Usually , after greeting the sister at the turn , I 'd go down the hall to the visiting room , long and narrow , with high slit windows and the same wicker furniture . Originally , there was a wall bisecting the room , with a small turnstile off to the right . The window opening was wide , panoramic even , but shielded by no fewer than four layers of obstruction : a woven , riveted iron grate ; a set of vertical bars ; a black curtain and folding wooden doors . The wall started coming down in the mid-Sixties . First the grate went , then one summer I arrived to find the wall itself vaporized . The whole steely membrane gone . Before the demise of the proscenium I 'd sit waiting , like a jail visitor or playgoer , for the parting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anticipation became a sacrament of sorts ; the outward signs were the jangling of keys , the click of locks , the clapping of wooden panels folding away , finally the drawing of the curtains . There would be my aunt and the prioress in their raven robes , veils pulled back . I was one of the lucky few in those days to see her face ; only relatives and close friends usually were permitted . There was an hourglass on a table behind them . If a sister 's visitors were weekly the sand was used to count time , limits  --  always limits . I wish I had been there to tear the wall . down . How I 'd have swung the sledge ! The turnstile remains though , a mute and atrophied monument . Seeing and being able to embrace Aunt Betz after nearly ten years was a mortal handed resurrection . But all the while , I recall , they said the famous line , " The bars were n't to keep us in , but you out . " I knew how it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an end , finitely . The greatest hazard to contemplative life is ever the well-intentioned friend or relative who burns out his welcome with longing and enthusiasm . Seems nephews are among the most blithe . ly ignorant offenders . While Carmelites serve the Church and society as a storehouse , a sanctuary for the faith preserved in its primal state , they are as touchme-nets , they withdraw at too heavy a hand . In the chapel there was a barrier too . The altar faced the wall and the cross above it ; to either side were gratings . Behind the wall is the room where the sisters heard mass and sang , a spectral choir . There is where my aunt was transformed , where she took on the habit . There I came to know stone . When a woman hopeful comes among the Carmelites she must speak with the prioress and the other sisters , her calling and character evaluated . Next she may be allowed to stay for some trial period as a postulant , usually six to nine months ; then she becomes a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her first vows ; in another three years she becomes a chapter or voting member of the community . Except for major policy decisions ( although they are consulted they do not vote ) the novices are involved with every other aspect of the community . This includes maintenance , housekeeping , cooking , correspondence and the substantial altar bread operation . The making and sale of altar breads to parishes in the Midwest and other parts of the country provides most of their revenue . Recently , because the roof was in need of repair they had to ask for contributions from their friends on the outside . The last time they had to do so was back in the early Sixties . Each monastery has its own means of support ; vestment making , even printing are the methods of other Carmelites . Even now , after renewal , during the work day silence is kept , the discipline remains . Twenty years ago , when a woman became a novice the ceremony involved much of the symbolism of marriage . The sister even wore a wedding gown . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dignified motions and wishing to blazes the business were over ... and expecting Aunt Betz to come home to Grandma 's where she belongs . . . belongs . Childish cupidity , even for a fouryear-old . The stone rose up into my legs and took the heart from me , leaving stiffness behind . Gradually , I came to know that she was never coming home . I realized the stone , the moment and substance have been a part of me ever since . During the mass following , I thought it ironic that the sisters had to come to the window in the grate to receive communion . They received the consecrated host , the essential sacrament of Catholicism , from the worldly precincts of the chapel . The last of the grates is gone . The sisters and a few regular outsiders attend daily mass behind the facade . In a circle they congregate , with the priest and sacrifice in the center . I asked Sister Miriam , a Carmelite for fifty years and herself a former prioress , how she felt about the changes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " None specifically , " she says , her head tilted slightly ; perched forward in her seat , full of poise . The keys in her hand jingle lightly as she continues , " I do know this  --  there is no going back . Change is going to be a part of our lives from now on . The ability to change must be part of us . We must retain that ability . To he disposed to change no matter how old we become . The changes have been made . And I do n't mean change for change 's sake . I simply mean that growth means change . You have to . . . . The very concept of holiness means you have to change : living with God means transformation . So change is inherent , it was in our roots . The concept was there from the beginning . But it has evolved . " I asked her whether the sisters at less avant-garde Carmelite monasteries would relate to the same idea of growth . " I do n't know how they would articulate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goes on . " I 'm sure they would subscribe to the concept of growth ... continual growth , yes . . . that is basic .. ? yes . . . there is no doubt about that . But we do differ on what is essential and what is nonessential . The habit is an essential to them . I do think that a person can be very holy , very dedicated without the habit . I am not tremendously for or against the habit myself . My goal in discarding the habit was to be free . My happiness , not just my contentment , but my growth , does not depend on what I have on my back . I do believe I could put the habit back on . .. . We can communicate with the more conservative Carmelites ) but it does hurt the sisters very , very deeply that we can not accept the same essentials . There is a real gap there . It hurts them , it hurts us . I do n't personally think that we have to agree . I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way each one thinks . " Sister Miriam is thoughtful in her words , she is careful to say what she means and mean what she says . I felt , as she spoke , the door of time slam open . The sense of continuity was overwhelming . I realized the greatest tradition here was one of reform and renewal in the broadest terms , the pursuit to know God . But pursuit is the wrong word . There is nothing frantic about it , rather , an openness to personal and communal revelation . Patience . Still , I worried and wondered about the younger generation of nuns . How does one instill the discipline of decades in such an atmosphere ? Sister Jean Alice , again a former prioress , a nun for twenty-seven years , cast her own particular insight : " The question of the current generation is very important to me . In their own minds 1 think there is something ... I would n't call it anxiety ... They know we come from something very precious , and they are very earnest in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are going to be the ones to carry on . I happen to be involved with that formation , and there is a real reserve in me not to put strictures on younger people that hamper them . Yet there is a concern that we do n't fail them by not having enough support . " The hindrances Sister spoke of are the highly formalized way of acting from the days of yore  --  the greetings in Latin , the opening of personal correspondence by others , the bowing , the incessant permissions , not to mention the severest restrictions on travel outside cloister . But , most of all , the liturgy . The acts of community prayer , at office and mass . Once , both were strictly designed , archaic and stiff . Today the sisters work at their liturgies with sincere creative abandon . The homilies at mass are dialogues by the community on the scripture , not priestly monologues . The thrice daily prayers of office are the most varied , making use of contemporary or classical music , scripture and , on occasion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the more inventive and free they showed themselves to be , the more alien I felt . I wished the bars and curtains back ; barriers are easier to deal with than pure intensity , however quietly exerted . At the evening office on Saturday , Sister Maggie , a twenty-eight year-old transfer from an active congregation , performed an interpretive dance after dusk had been tapped out . As Nadia 's Theme played itself out from the machine a sister recited the Magnificat , the prayer of the Blessed Virgin , while Sister Maggie transmuted the sound into substance , movement as reverent play .... Given another setting , another set of peers , the event could have been maudlin . Yet , the total divorcing of the ego , so unassuming , from her action left me to remove my glasses . I had to . In the dim of candlelight the blur of my myopia set up enough division , enough distance , to give me breath . At least part of that devastation was because I knew Aunt Betz had done much the same thing not very long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told me of it . She had to do it just once ; the desire has n't set upon her since . It 's the tradition of the juggler extended . You know the story . The juggler came to perform before the altar on Christmas , an exclusive act before God , accepted and acclaimed for its sincerity and humility . Here , in this case , it was n't only God . How gracious to see two private virtues dwell in community unstrained , F : secret thoughts at anytime . 10 . At night , before you go to sleep , think whether you have done anything that was wrong during the day , and pray to God to forgive you . If anyone has done you wrong , forgive him in your heart . 11 . If you have not learned something useful , or been in some way useful , during the past day , think that it is a day lost and be very sorry for it . 12 . Trust in the Lord , and He will guide you in the way of good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shining light that shineth more and more unto the perfect day . 13 . We must do all the good we can to all men , for this is well pleas ing in the sight of God . He delights to see his children walk in love , and do good one to another . McGuffey not only treated the broader moral issues , he also dealt with such attributes as punctuality  --  and how it was different from punctuation . Thrift and hard work were driven home with emphasis . The final paragraph in the First Reader showed an awareness of the rising cost of education . " Take good care of your new book , " he wrote , " and give your old Reader to some child who is too poor to buy one . " In thousands of instances the Readers were passed to younger children in the family . The books were rightly prized , along with the family Bible  --  to which the Readers were second in influence for almost a century . The advanced Readers offered a wide range of literature from unknown writers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Lord Byron , Nathaniel Hawthorne , Charles Dickens , Daniel Webster and William Cullen Bryant . The frontier environment was not overlooked . American Indians , by the way , were treated as noble , but unfortunate , victims of the white man  --  a departure from the widely held image of Indians as mangy forest creatures . McGuffey treated another subject  --  death  --  in a surprisingly frank manner . Again , his material was attuned to the primitive backwoods where weather and work took their toll . With only home remedies and few doctors , the typical family was intimately acquainted with death . The Third Reader presents an anonymous poem of extended length entitled " The Dying Boy , " a first person account of how the boy felt on his death bed . Under the title was this admonition : " In solemn pieces of this kind , you should read slower and more softly than usual . " In the Sixth Reader McGuffey reprinted " Death of Little Nell " from Dickens 's The Old Curiosity Shop . He also included William Cullen Bryant 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ typical of poetic tastes of the period . It was a sign of " softness " to weep over physical hardships , but a good cry over a character in a poem or novel was a sound emotional outlet . Here is the beginning of such a scene : The melancholy days have come , The saddest of the year , Of walling winds and naked woods And meadows brown and sear . . . . By the time the class had reached the concluding stanza they were all , including the teacher , in tears . And then I think of one . who in Her youthful beauty died , The fair meek blossom that grew up And faded by my side . . . . The Readers were more than a century ahead of their time in presenting death as a class discussion topic . Dozens of other relevant social , moral and spiritual problems were met head-on in McGuffey 's
