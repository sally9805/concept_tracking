During the century before its fall to the conquistadors , Inca civilization flourished with startling grandeur . Inhabiting the Andean slopes from what is now Ecuador and Peru down into Chile and western Argentina , the Incas cut paved roads through the mountains , laid out elaborate irrigation systems , erected high suspension bridges across deep ravines . For all their engineering skills , these early Americans have long puzzled scholars because , unlike all the great peoples of the ancient world , they seemed to have no written language . Did they pass on their culture from generation to generation only by word of mouth ? <P> Talking Boards . Now a distinguished German ethnographer has offered a fresh solution to the puzzle . The Incas , Dr. Thomas S. Barthel told the 39th International Congress of Americanists in Lima last week , did indeed have a primitive script . It has remained available , though unrecognized , through the centuries . Further , said the Tbingen University professor , he has translated about 25 of the symbols . <P> Barthel 's claim provoked some scholarly skepticism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at cracking ancient linguistic codes . Fifteen years ago , Barthel reported deciphering the so-called " talking boards " of Easter Island in the South Pacific . The Inca mystery was every bit as challenging . But he had invaluable help from Peruvian Archaeologist Victoria de la Jara . If there was a written language , she suspected , it must be hidden in the geometric designs ( tocapus ) found on priestly garments and wooden vessels . <P> For many years , Seorita de la Jara immersed herself in Inca history and painstakingly catalogued tocapus . But she failed to find what she was looking for : an Inca equivalent of the Rosetta stone , the key that opened ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs to modern understanding . Finally , she turned her researches over to Barthel . With the same shrewdness that enabled him to decipher several Allied codes during World War II , Barthel made use of an important clue in her material . Many of the Inca vessels bore pictures as well as tocapus . In fact , one common scene portrayed the act of toasting the gods . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , he believed , recorded the same act . <P> Son of the Sun . That connection established , Barthel turned to the tocapus embroidered on one notable Inca relic-a priestly garment , or uncu , now in Washington 's Bliss Collection . He decided that the repetition of some of the tocapus meant that the same message was being emphasized . More important , he noticed that several signs , like Chinese pictograms , resembled real objects . That enabled him to pick out the symbols for the supreme Inca deity , Kon Ticsi Viracocha ( popularly , Kon-Tiki ) , who is represented by the tocapu for heat ( kon ) and two bases of pyramids ( ticsi ) , meaning foundation and earth . By the time Barthel finished , he had translated an entire column of tocapus : " Kon Ticsi Viracocha is the son of the sun , the heat , the teacher of the earth , the priest , the origin of light , the lord of the sun .
