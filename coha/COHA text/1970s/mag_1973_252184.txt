<P> Whatever else Watergate critics say about President Nixon , they have usually been willing to concede his mastery in foreign relations . But these days Europeans are beginning to doubt Nixon 's wisdom even in foreign affairs-at least in Europe . While Nixon and Henry Kissinger still call for a bold New Atlantic Charter , a host of anxieties about America 's intentions plague Europeans . <P> They are particularly troubled by the new chummy atmosphere between the U.S. and the Soviet Union . At the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe , held in Helsinki and attended by 35 Foreign Ministers ( TIME , July 16 ) , the Europeans openly voiced their suspicions that Nixon may have made too many concessions to Soviet Leader Leonid Brezhnev . They suspected that Nixon gave in to the Russians on such issues as mutual-but not necessarily balanced-troop withdrawals and nuclear deescalation . <P> Typical of how widespread are European suspicions was a proposal made by Rumania 's President Nicolae Ceausescu in May that lesser countries on both sides might have to band together to avoid becoming the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ struck Italians as overly suspicious then , TIME Correspondent Jordan Bonfante now reports that " since the summit and Helsinki there seems to be a new wave , or at least a sizable ripple , of comparable misgivings among the Italians too . " <P> First Taste . West Germany fears especially the Nixon-Brezhnev Agreement on the Prevention of Nuclear War , which calls for urgent bilateral consultations in the event of the risk of nuclear war , but provides for only subsidiary talks with America 's European allies . Chancellor Willy Brandt got a first taste of the agreement when he received no more than a vaguely worded letter from Nixon only 48 hours before the agreement was signed . From Bonn , TIME Correspondent Bruce Nelan reports that " the reaction to the nuclear agreement was a collective gasp in Western Europe . Almost everyone believes that De Gaulle is now vindicated in his view that the U.S. would not risk nuclear destruction to defend Europe or risk New York to save Hamburg .

It was partly to allay that anxiety that Washington invited West German Foreign Minister Walter Scheel to Washington last week for hastily arranged talks with Nixon and Kissinger . Scheel presumably re-emphasized German fears that the Nixon-Brezhnev agreement robs NATO of nuclear credibility and opens the door to Soviet blackmail . <P> Less ostensibly perturbed about America 's motives , British officials nonetheless have their own fears . They are especially disappointed with Washington 's failure to demand more concessions from the Russians . TIME London Correspondent William McWhirter reports that while British officials have been pleased with the frankness of U.S. briefings about the Nixon-Brezhnev talks , " they remain cynical , suspicious and disenchanted about the haste with which the U.S. traded away its own leverage over Soviet policy . It seems to the British that the Communists now have a short-term license to ruthlessly consolidate power within their own bloc-without fear of U.S. interference . "                    @
