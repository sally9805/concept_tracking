THE 1968 campaign began with bumps for Correspondent John Austin . Covering the early phase of Richard Nixon 's nomination quest , Austin was struck in the head by a 5-lb. package of confetti at a Chicago rally . Then , as he tried to keep up with a Nixon motorcade in San Francisco , he was hit by a police motorcycle . He took his wife to one political event , at Madison Square Garden . She made it through the police line easily without official credentials ; he was detained , though he wore the laminated press card issued to newsmen only after they passed a federal security check . <P> Nothing so unsettling has happened to Austin during the preliminaries of the 1972 campaign-at least not yet . Part of a Washington-based team whose members rotate among the would-be candidates , Austin drew Edmund Muskie as his first assignment . His reporting for this week 's cover story really began eight months ago when he got his first long , close look at the Senator by accompanying him to London , the Middle East and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thomas Point , Me. , to Capitol Hill . The only heavy objects hitting Austin during this period were the puns that Muskie likes to mutter to those at his elbow ( looking at a stone sarcophagus in Egypt , the Senator observed : " These Egyptians sure did n't take the afterlife for granite " ) . <P> In his files to Associate Editor Lance Morrow , who wrote the cover story , Austin concentrated on Muskie 's personality , tactics and campaign organization . Dean Fischer analyzed his legislative record . Simmons Fentress , a senior political correspondent who has been covering state and national elections from North Carolina to South Viet Nam for 20 years , assayed Muskie 's overall strategy and how it relates to that of his competitors . <P> " Washington becomes one big political beehive with the approach of a presidential year , " says Fentress . " Everything becomes timed and tooled for Election Day . The rumors get wilder than usual and the ante is raised in that perpetual con game between reporter and news source . " The election is 14 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , motorcycles and other hazards along the way . But for those who cover and write about politics , happy times are here again .
