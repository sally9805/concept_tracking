RICHARD NIXON was probably the first President to take office vowing that he would slow down the U.S. economy . The nation 's No. 1 football fan had a " game plan " that his advisers said would stop inflation without much pain to the public or danger to the politicians . No need to tackle wages and prices directly . No need to get involved in messy strikes or stop end runs by steel prices . There would be no mandatory controls , no nasty squabbles between the White House and business or labor leaders , no interference at all with the free market . Instead , Government would simply balance its budget and pump less money into the banking system . As funds became scarcer in the private economy , business would simmer down and so , too , would prices . For a few " awkward months , " predicted Nixon 's economists , the nation would suffer mild " slowing pains " of high interest rates , little growth in production , some drop in profits and a moderate rise in unemployment . Eventually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and normal expansion of output and hiring could resume . <P> The need for a slowdown was evident . But now , to an ever-growing number of businessmen , workers , consumers-and voters-the game plan sounds like an exercise in fantasy . The awkward months have lengthened into painful seasons , and the alleviation of inflation that was supposed to be worth all the unpleasantness seems nowhere in sight . In his 16 months in office , Nixon has posted an unenviable economic box score : <P> The industrial production index has risen only .2% , and U.S. factories are operating at less than 80% of capacity . <P> Corporate profits before taxes have dropped 11% . <P> Unemployment has jumped by almost one-half , to a five-year high of 4.8% of the work force . One million more Americans than a year ago are unsuccessfully looking for work . Consumer prices have soared 7.5% , chopping almost 70 out of the real value of the dollar . Last week the Labor Department reported that inflation accelerated in April . The cost of living rose at a seasonally adjusted annual rate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Other downbeat news darkened the gloomiest week that U.S. business has shuddered through in recent years . In Washington , embarrassed Administration officials conceded that the budget surpluses they had predicted for fiscal 1970 and 1971 will turn to deficits . On Wall Street , the most unnerving stock market reports since the Depression 1930s became daily more dismal . The Dow-Jones industrial average fell 40 points to a new seven-year low of 662 ; during the past 18 months , it has plunged more than 320 points . <P> Unquestionably , the situation is serious , but some qualifications are necessary . The economic picture appears bleaker than it really is because the market tends to overreact . It jumps extravagantly when the economy is strong , plunges precipitously when business weakens ( and sometimes when it does not ) . Moreover , the economy has not suddenly run out of steam because of some inexplicable decline of consumer demand . Most of the drops in profits and jobs are the result of a deliberate , managed slowdown . <P> Still , the market is the most reliable indicator of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in the Government 's ability to keep it healthy . Even though the economy remains
