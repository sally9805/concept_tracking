Few correspondents covering the war in Indochina have been so completely frustrated as the group of 50-odd camped at Quang Tri in northwestern South Viet Nam . They have been virtually stymied in their efforts to report major South Vietnamese operations in Laos . Officially , their only source of information is briefings by U.S. and South Vietnamese officers . U.S. helicopter pilots have been forbidden to carry correspondents into Laos . And when some American flyers leaked word to newsmen last week about an embattled South Vietnamese Ranger battalion , they were promptly prevented from having further conversations with correspondents . The pilots ' operations center at Khe Sanh is now ringed with barbed wire and guarded by gruff MPs , who are under strict orders to keep all civilians out . <P> The need for firsthand reporting from Laos is pressing-especially in light of the longstanding unreliability of South Vietnamese military communiqus . Last week the Ranger battalion 's losses were classified as " light , " only to be revealed three days later as 100 killed , 145 wounded and 78 missing . South Viet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ killed . U.S. reports were also suspect , and some information officers were openly scornful of what was being pumped out to the press . " There ca n't be a credibility gap , " scoffed one , " when there 's no credibility . " <P> Helicopter Hazards . As they search for the story of the Laos campaign , correspondents have had little choice but to ride to the front in Viet Nam air force ( VNAF ) helicopters-high risk transportation at best . Comparatively inexperienced , VNAF pilots fly well enough but are poor map readers-a potentially fatal failing in an area where pinpoint accuracy is essential . Three weeks ago , four civilian photographers , including LIFE 'S Larry Burrows , were presumably killed when a VNAF helicopter got lost over Laos and was shot down . Staffers of A.P. , U.P.I. , the New York Times and Washington Post have simply stopped riding with South Vietnamese pilots . <P> Last week , a VNAF chopper , carrying Newsweek Correspondent Franois Sully , General Do Cao Tri and eight others to a staging area in Cambodia , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were killed . The urbane , Paris-born Sully , 43 , was a bon vivant with a penchant for tailored shirts and vintage wine . He first came to Indochina in the mid-1940s , and , as a combat correspondent for TIME , was one of the last newsmen to leave Dienbienphu before it fell in 1954 . He was the 34th journalist to be killed in Indochina since 1965 ( another 17 are missing ) . <P> Reading Disability . Sully 's death underscored the danger of flying in VNAF helicopters . Though General Tri had a South Vietnamese pilot for his fatal flight , most other Vietnamese generals now travel in U.S. Army choppers , fearful that VNAF pilots may lose their way . Fortnight ago a VNAF helicopter carrying U.S. newsmen got temporarily but totally lost over unfamiliar terrain in South Viet Nam . In another case , a VNAF pilot casually chalked map coordinates to his destination on the outside of his chopper windshield , only to find himself forced to try to read them backwards from the inside of his ship during flight .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
