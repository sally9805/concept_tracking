Letters The Legitimate Settlers of the West Bank To the Editor : In his June 4 column , " How to Hurt Sadat , " Anthony Lewis sidestepped the most salient point , namely that the Camp David agreement stipulated free movement , including settlement , for both Jews and Arabs on the West Bank . Referring to legitimate settlers as " squatters " is unworthy of Mr. Lewis . As for his castigation of Rabbi Moshe Levinger , leader of the Greater Israel Movement , unquestionably Rabbi Levinger is better acquainted than Mr. Lewis with both the history of the area and the need for defensive positions against encroachment and eventual takeover by those Arabs who have loudly proclaimed their intention to do precisely that . The site of the latest settlement was the scene of just such a scenario . It was in Hebron , in 1929 , that the Arabs massacred every Jewish inhabitant . Rabbi Levinger 's grandfather ? also a rabbi ? was killed , along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Israelis in general should be more concerned with increasing Sadat 's Mobil Oil 's Costs , Prices and Taxes To the Editor : In a recent advertisement in The Times , the Mobil Oil Corporation attacked me for my statements against domestic crude oil price decontrol . If I had Mobil 's millions for advertising , I would respond in kind . Since I do not , a letter to the editor must suffice . Specifically , Mobil suggested that I mislead the public when I point out that American oil companies now spend about $1.50 to pump a barrel of domestic crude and then sell the same barrel of oil for more than $8 . If Mobil wants to excoriate someone for circulating these figures , it need n't search as far as the U.S. Senate . It can find a suitable culprit in its own accounting department , for the figures are Mobil 's own . In its 1979 Form 10-K Annual Report to the Securities and Exchange Commission , Mobil lists its domestic crude oil " average production cost , as defined by the S.E.C. " as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ average price /transfer value " as $8.33 per barrel , for a per-barrel markup of 448 percent . In a footnote , Mobil suggests that the S.E.C. 's definition reflects only half of acutal costs . Even if one accepts this argument ( which Mobil alone among all the oil companies makes ) , the corporation 's markup on a barrel of crude still is more than 174 percent . To some cynical souls , all of this might seem to be just another case of the kind of rubber bookkeeping which has been prevalent in the oil industry . For example , in its critical advertisement Mobil also decries claims that " Mobil 's effective tax rate on U.S. income was 21.2 percent . " The ad states that " Mobil 's actual effective U.S. tax rate on U.S. book income was 41.9 percent . " Incredibly , in the very next paragraph Mobil goes on to note that on a barrel of domestic oil selling for $8.33 " about $1.35 is paid in taxes . " For those who left their slide rules at home , $1.35 is about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turns out to be its own most damning accuser . I continue tosee in these figures little justification for giving the oil companies a bonanza of unearned profits as incentive to pump old crude . THOMAS F. EAGLETON U.S. Senator from Missouri Washington , June 5 , 1979 To the Editor : We are writing on behalf of our client , the Textile Rental Services Association of America , to express the deep concern of the members of that association with ? a misstatement of fact ? the linking of members of that industry with organized crime ? contained in an editorial published by The New York Times on April 19 . The editorial , " The Case for Casinos Is Still Not Made , " in discussing the possible connection between organized crime and casinos , stated that " other possible areas of infiltration of organized crime in connection with casinos include ancillary services like money lending and linen laundries . " The obvious conclusion that can be drawn from this editorial is that the linen supply and laundry businesses are commonly fronts for organized crime . The members of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Times and other media forms persist in linking their industry with organized crime with broad statements unsupported by any evidence . The Textile Rental Services Association , made up of thousands of smallbusiness men throughout the nation , is conducting an active campaign against this kind of reporting and is attempting to inform the public and the media of the fact that there is no evidence to support these broad statements implying that this industry is infiltrated by organized crime . In recent years there have been no prosecutions brought by any state or Federal agency in the United States linking in any way the linen supply and laundry industry with organized crime . Recently , the State of New Jercredibility than securing their own existence , it is Mr. Lewis , not the " squatters , " who is " making a mockery of Camp David . " HESKEL M.

While both Mr. Lewis and the State Department should be commended for their sentiments , they both disregard a fundamental reality , namely , that the Israeli occupation of the West Bank and the setting up of Jewish settlements there are far from being aberrations ; they are a fulfillment of the main premises of Zionism Korn says , " Yes , Pay $1 Million " per year to American executives , " American management is still considered the finest in the world . . // Leavenveorch Jackson Executive compensation must be clearly tied to results " Op-Ed May 29 . Yes , but what results ? He must refer to earnings per share , shortterm . American companies ' long-term prospects and past results raise questions about executives ' performance and compensation . The productivity of U.S. companies To the Editor : The May 26 letter about broadcasting from the Rev. Everett C. Parker should not go without challenge . Yes , as Mr. Parker says , broadcast programming is the " honey that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not apologize . After all , educators want the " programming " that will fill the classrooms , lawyers are eager to increase their clientele , politicians want the most votes and ministers are always working to aug- ? ment the numbers in their congregations . Yet each entity was intended , as Mr. Parker writes about broadcasting , to serve a need , or , put in the terms of our self-defined clich ? , to serve " the public interest . " sey , for example , conducted an exhaustive investigation to determine if organized crime had infiltrated the casino gambling business in Atlantic City . Although articles in The Times improperly stated that the laundry and linen supply industry was traditionally infiltrated by organized crime , the investigation conducted by the New Jersey State Commission and by the New Jersey Casino Control Commission failed to turn up a single shred of evidence linking organized crime with the laundry and linen industries in Atlantic City . We are sure that you did not have any basis in fact for concluding that the laundry industry is commonly infiltrated by organized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should end immediately . The members of the Textile Rental Services Association of America request that you cease and desist from printing news articles and editorials in the future which link their industry with organized crime directly or indirectly .

" Those people who happen to be in Eretz Israel , as Palestine is referred to in Zionist parlance , are aliens to be expelled or , if they inconveniently stay on , to be relegated to the status of a minority , granted only limited " rights . " Hence the inevitable territorial and demographic expansionism of Zionism , without which Zionism would cease to be itself . Hence also the incessant Israeli talk of limited Palestinian " self-rule , " which does not extend to security , land , water , air and God knows what . The hope that the Zionist state of Israel be more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from setting up further settlements in the West Bank is really ' groundless . Official Israeli spokesmen would be the first to agree with Me . A. M. ELMESSIRT Adviser on Cultural Affairs Arab Information Center The League of Arab States New York , June 5 , 1979 has declined to about 1 percent . U.S.-based manufacturers are trailing European and Japanese firms in global markets for textiles , shoes , steel , autombiles . U.S. deficits in international trade are at an all-time high . Investments in research and development and capital equipment for the military products divisions ( financed by U.S. taxpayers ) have outpaced investments in research and development and capital equipment for civil products divisions ( financed by shareholders ) of American manufacturing conglomerates . U.S. executives have let growth of the U.S. arms industry jeopardize far greater gains ( in earnings per share ) from growth of U.S. civil-industrial operations , which have languished in " stagflation " during most of the 1970 's . Last but not least is an intangible but nonetheless important measure of executives ' performance . The quality of American corporate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ declining . " Yes , Pay $1 Million " so they can get it while they can ! Like too many leaders of American institutions , Mr. Korn seems to confuse means and ends of professional services by American executives . ( Prof. ) ROBERT E. MCGARRAH Department of Management University of Massachusetts Amherst , Mass. , May 29 , 1979 Mr. Parker has obviously done only part of his research , the part that shows broadcast profits . Somehow he never seems to examine the losses . But the truth is likely that the Reverend simply does not believe in a commercial system of broadcasting and is unwilling to say so . In a. totally non-commercial system ? which anyone is free to prefer ? there would be plenty of available outlets because without commercials the only ones who could afford them would be rich government , rich foundations or rich churches . As one who has been associated with commercial broadcasting for many years and who has noted Mr. Parker 's frequent , venemous anti-broadcasting tirades , I suggest that the cross he carries may be his own seething @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man . BRENDA R. TANGER Newton Centre , Mass. , May 28 , MU Take It Easy To the Editor : Herman H. Spitz and his tongue-incheek anti-jogging proposal to convert the form of jogging into the form of manual labor to conserve energy letter June 3 is a perfect paradigm of the intolerant Puritan work ethic , which contributes so much dis-ease in our society . A healthy state ( one at ease ) is not one in which every robust citizen is harnessed to a plow but one where work and play are harmoniously balanced . Many Americans think it 's ' about time that we get on a new path , and some of us have chosen to go the jogging route to keep in equilibrium . Let 's hope that when many of us are elderly and the grass is high , we 'll be fit enough to mow the lawn ourselves while allowing others to contemplate their navels if they so desire , without guilt .
