txt " Our major problem is malting the public aware that the Alaska pipeline would be no different from the one running thru their backyards in the lower 48 . " TMs view us Erie a.s.a 111111 . J11 oil pipeline , planned to run 789 miles from one end of Alaska to the other , comes from Frank A. Therrell , a technical permit expert for the Alyeska Pipeline Service Co. , the firm that wants to build the line . Therrell was sipping coffee in Al 's Eskimo Cafe in Barrow , Alaska , purveyors of the finest reindeer soup , after flying the pipeline route to the North Slope . " Believe me , we 'd build the pipeline with the same concern for human safety as we do in Kansas , Texas , or anywhere else , " said Therrell . His remarks show a curious lack of understanding about what the Alaska pipeline delays have been all about . Environmental safety , not human safety , has caused all the fuss and stalled pipeline construction for three years . " THIS pipeline could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without any serious consequences , " Therrell insists . " It would have been a safe pipeline . " Opponents of the pipeline say Alyeska 's biggest mistake has been to treat the polar regions of Alaska as the they were the same as somebody 's backyard in Chicago or Dallas . They fear catastrophic oil spills , destruction of wildlife , and the ruination of this nation 's last great stretch of wilderness . What about the effect on the environment ? " That ai n't the point , " answered Therrell . He said the $65 million Alyeska has spent on engineering and environmental studies in the , last three years " will provide a pipeline with fewer maintenance problems . " He insists " nothing has been changed . " A steady stream of press releases from Alyeska , voicing deep concern for the environment , tends to contradict their men in the field , such as Therrell . " There is no question that a pipeline built without regard for Alaska 's environment could result in severe , irreparable damage to that environment , " said one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only half of the pipeline will be buried instead of 95 per cent of it , as originally planned , and that special care is being taken about earthquake damage and navigational safety along the tanker route from Valdez to the American West Coast . There also is no question that big stakes are involved . Scientists believe that the Arctic might be mankind 's coal , natural gas , and oil storehouse for the next century . The giants of the oil industry have plunked down $2 billion in North Slope oil development so far . A dozen oil companies have a piece of the action , including Atlantic-Richfield , British Petroleum , and Standard Oil of California and Ohio . The petroleum moguls were so sure they had the whole deal sewn up that they bought $1 billion worth of pipe in 1969 from Japan . Then the environmental suits challenging the pipeline were filed , and the pipe has been lying like stacks of giant straws at Valdez , Fairbanks , ad Prudhoe Bay . Each section is four feet in diameter and 60 feet long . ALYESKA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waiting . With tentative approval from the United States House and Senate , Alyeska officials say they expect fullscale construction to begin in 1974 , with Prudhoe Bay oil hitting U.S. markets by 1977 . At its peak capacity , the pipeline will be supplying 2 million barrels a day to the West Coast . Arguments favoring the Alaska pipeline by oil companies , Alyeska , and Alaskan state officials follow exactly the same pattern . They usually begin by denouncing the rival Canadian pipeline . A trans-Canadian route , says Alaska Gov . William Egan , would take five to eight years longer to build , would be controled by a foreign power , would cost $6 billion , and would be longer than the Alaska route . Canadians say the Alaskans often are misinformed . On the merits of the Alaska pipeline , Alaskans and oilmen raise these points : ? Oil supply ? Alaska could not produce all the oil the U.S. needs , but it would amount to about 12 per cent of 1U.S. needs . ? Balance of payments ? The U.S. now imports $8.5 bitlion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rise to $30. billion a year by 1985 . Alaskan oil could cut the How of American dollars to foreign countries and stem a dollar disaster . AT $4 A barrel , Alaskan oil would save nearly $5 million a day not being spent for imported oil A heated retort on this point comes from Jim Kowalsky , Arctic field representative for Friends of the Earth , who said , " Alyeska paid Japan $1 billion for the pipe . Why did n't they consider the balance of payments then ? " ? National security ? Heavy reliance on the Middle East countries , or even Canada , for large amounts of oil is seen as a threat to national security . The U.S. would be at the mercy of oil producers in the Mideast , and this is seen as an invitation to diplomatic and economic blackmail . THE HOLD that oil-producing Arab countries already have over the U.S. is seen as a factor in the recent attack upon Israel . ? Money ? The state of Alaska would get $368 million a year in oil revenue from the pipeline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oil revenue . in settlement of their land claims . ? Jobs and development ? The three years of pipeline construction is expected to create 10,900 lobs in.Alaska on the line alone , and another 30 , - 000 jobs related to it in the two peak years . Many Alaskan see their future tied to oil production . " The development of Alaska 's rich natural resources holds the only hope of its people for attaining the quality of life enjoyed elsewhere in the nation , " said Sen. Mike Gravel D. , Alaska . A FLEET of 35 oil tankers also will be needed , creating more jobs in American shipyards , related services , and for crews to man and maintain the ships . ? Energy crisis ? The Alaskan pipeline is advertised as the quickest way to get new , sources of oil to thell.S . Whether you believe the energy crisis is a hoax or a menace , it has boosted the Alaskan pipeline . Alaskan officials talk of the serious setbacks and the ' vast amounts of money lost thru delays in building the pipeline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Co . Indiana , says things are n't all that drastic . " We figured soma delay into our original plans for the pipeline , " said Prangs . To sweeten the deal , many Alaskan pipeline supporters say the Midwest will be getting natural gas sometime in the future if the pipeline goes thru . Midwesterners favor the Canadian oil pipeline route , which would tap the Alaskan North Slope , because it would end in Chicago . " By approving the transAlaskan pipeline . we will be able to get earlier delivery of gas to the Midwest areas from Canada and Alaska , " said Sen. Gravel . Gov . Egan says that by " allowing Prudhoe Bay production to begin , natural gas wilt be available for the Midwest . But how ? An examination of the Alask a pipeline plans showed nothing about a natural gas pipeline to Chicago or anywhere else . " ALYESKA Is not in the natural gas pipeline business , " explained Therrell . " By law , we 're only allowed to operate in the liquid petroleum business . " Promises of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a " natural conclusion , " and not related to any specific plans for a gas pipeline to the Midwest . Unaccountably , E. L. Patton , president of Alyeska , in August announced that if Prudhoe Bay oil started reaching U.S. markets by 1977 , natural gas from the North Slope will be " available to the Midwest by 1979.
