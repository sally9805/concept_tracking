Despite Jimmy Carter 's tough talk on the stump about a windfall profits tax , the American Petroleum Institute , the registered ' industry lobby for Big Oil , has infiltrated ; and , virtually runs , the Department of Energy . The pervasive influence of the oil industry on the department has two interrelated causes . High-level administrative positions are filled with corporate executive types , many of whom have direct ties , to the oil industry ; and the major work of the department is leased out , most of it through no-bid , deals , to private consulting firms that , in turn , are consultants for the oil industry . This obvious conflict of interest , given the structure at the top , does not disturb the department , which has said time and again that it makes , no effort to determine the private ' business ties of its hired advisers . On April 29 , 1977 , the White House made public Carter 's much-ballyhooed National Energy Plan , which Carter has upbraided Congress for not passing . Unmentioned at the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Guttman , a Washington lawyer and energy expert , called attention to it before a Senate subcommittee last October  --  was the fact that the basics of the plan were prepared by D.O.E . consultants who were also oil industry consultants . A firm called Energy and Environmental Analysis , received two contracts  --  one for $194,000 , a second for $34,800 ? to work on the plan . Although the D.O.E . did not inquire into E.E.A. 's other associations , Guttman dis-covered by ' reading the firm 's own brochures that its clients include Exxon , Shell Oil and Standard Oil of Ohio . A second consulting firm ; ? Big Oil ( Continued From Front Cover ) Arthur D. Little , also worked on " the President 's plan " and received $180,000 for its labors . The firm has worked for a number of coal producers and companies interested in nu-. clear and solar developments . The inordinate amount of double-interest input into the President 's National Energy Plan is just one example of the almost total penetration of the Energy Department by the oil interests . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bluntly stating that , in 1978 , the department , which has 20,000 employees , spent 79 percent of its total budget , a whopping $8.5 billion , in 5,000 awards to private contractors who were to tell it what it was to do and how to do it . This was the worst record , the G.A.O . report said , compiled by any Federal agency . The G.A.O . report added : Each of the five organizations within the Department of Energy appear to be contracting with private firms to carry out some of its basic management functions . These contracts are written so that the contractors are required to perform activities such as program planning and development and establishing goals and priorities . Some of these contracts also appear to provide contractors wide latitude for participation in the development of energy policy and offer the potential for allowing the contractor to determine energy policy . The footprints of the Rockefeller interests are all over this private-contracting double-agent system that does so much to mold national energy policy . In 1974 , the Federal Energy Administration , a predecessor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Parsippany , New Jersey , firm named R. Shriver Associates . The contract was issued at the insistence of David Rockefeller 's Chase Manhattan Bank . As the Department of Energy itself later explained : " Because of their position in the banking world , Chase will only deal with the government through a third party , and has so designated R. Shriver Associates . " The Shriver firm 's task was to " prepare statistics of U.S. energy flows for the International Energy Agency " and to monitor the agency 's " policies and procedures . " In other words , it was given broad responsibility for compiling the oil data on which national policy would be based . The Shriver relationship continued into the Carter Administration . In 1977 , it was hired to " document the need for and the required characteristics of a National Gas Emergency Management System . " And when oil-industry divestiture was proposed by irate Congressmen , the Shriver firm was given another contract to develop a " fact sheet " for the-use of the D.O.E . ' s agencies . This continued reliance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect of putting the department in the hands of the behemoths'of the oil industry . For , as Guttman pointed out , previous Senate committee findings showed that Chase ' board members included officers of Exxon and Standard Oil of Ohio ; that the Rockefeller family group , the largest single voting interest in Chase , is among the top voting interests in Exxon , Mobil and Standard Oil of Indiana , and that Chase Manhattan itself is among the top voting interests in Exxon , Mobil , Shell , SoCal , Standard of Indiana and Texaco . Quite a package . As a result of Chase 's insistence on the employment of the Shriver firm , one of its employees , a man named John Ian- , none , became an important figure on the Washington energy ' scene . Although he was an outside consultant , lannone was assigned office space at the Federal Energy Agency and became in appearance , if not in actual fact , a member of the Government 's energy establishment . His boss from April 1974 to July 1976 was Dr. Daniel B. Rathbun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dr. Rathbun left Government empioyment to become a vice president of the American Petroleum Institute , lannone followed him . Although lannone had shed the Shriver mantle for the cloak of the A.P.I. , this did not alter his cozy relationship with his old comrades in the D.O.E . He still had the run of the offices . Having once been granted the cachet of a member of the establishment , he still carried a semi-official aura about him , and had considerable influence with the Energy Department . Senator Howard Metzenbaum first exposed lannone 's double-agent role during hearings of the Senate Energy Committee in mid-1978 . The testimony shOwed that Ian-none often was able to supply his A.P.1. superiors ? with D.O.E . plans and papers before they became public . Such advance information , of course , enabled the petroleum lobby to exert quiet pressure to get the rules amended in the industry 's interest before public-interest groups had any idea what was happening . Senator Metzenbaum charged that one change lannone effected through his close ties with the D.O.E.raised the price of gasoline half a cent a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 , annone 's most notable , though not most important , feat involved a letter that Senator Edward M. Kennedy had written to David J. Bardin , . head of the Energy Department 's Economic Regulatory Adminis-tration . Kennedy was inquiring about the allocation of oil to smaller refiners . Gerald Emmer , Bardin 's assistant and one of lannone 's best contacts , gave the lobbyist a Xerox of Kennedy 's letter ; and investigation indicated that this copy wound up in A.P.I. files before Kennedy 's original letter was delivered to Bardin . Metzenbaum 's disclosure of lannone 's undercover activities caused shock waves in Washington , especially among consumer advocates who had been kept cooling their heels in the D.O.E . ' s outer offic6 while Iannone had the run of the place . " I 'm just stunned , " said James Flug of Energy Action . " These people got everything at the earliest , possible state in the regulatory process , having impact on the decisions at every step of the way , on issues we do n't even know exist . " Disclosure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investigation . Mark Green of Ralph Nader 's Congress Watch obtained a copy of lannone 's own report to the petroleum institute , summarizing his successes in espionage and influence-wielding during the first three months of 1978 . Green , Bardin and Representative John Dingell , chairman of the House Subcommittee on Energy and Power , all called on the D.O.E . to probe itself . The department 's Inspect &; General undertook the task . A report of his investigation was issued April 23 , 1979 . Its first conclusion was that the American Petroleum Institute , as a result of Iannone 's activities , " was able to obtain from D.O.E . staff copies of 23 draft rulemakings and internal D.O.E . memoranda and studies that had not been made formally available to the public in the latter half of 1977 and the first quarter of 1978. " lannone himself had balked at testifying , and the American Petroleum Institute , at first defied a subpoena to turn over its files . lannone , by a series of legal actions , frustrated ' the Inspector General , but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disclosed that it had set up a regular spy network , titled " Federal Agencies Department , " and that three other agents ? Henry Lum , Patricia Hammick and Susan Hodges  --  had cultivated contacts within the Department of Energy and flashed advance warnings . Iannone himself had supplied the petroleum institute with some 160 D.O.E . documents . , The Inspector General concluded that lannone , in his report to the A.P.I. , had sometimes misrepresented or exaggerated his influence .. Though this might be expected from an agent seeking to inflate his own importance , the investigation nevertheless substantiated lannone 's claim that he had modified a program of gasoline monitoring and decontrol known as Mogas so that it would yield larger profits for the oil industry . Ian-none accomplished this by advocating that the base period for pricing be changed from November 1977 to June 1977 . The theory was that , since gasoline prices are normally higher in summer , such a change would give the industry a higher base period with which to work . The D.O.E . Inspector General reported : " The documents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ February of 1978 , DOE did change the base month in its Mogas draft proposals from November to June . " lannone had claimed that he had been allowed to check the final Mogas rule making " for accuracy " before it was sent to the D.O.E . ' s general counsel , and Bardin confirmed that he had ordered " the Mogas monitoring formula reviewed by API . " The snooping of Iannone and the subservience shown by the Energy Department to a lobby like the American Petroleum Institute in allowing it to " review " its regulations in advance could only take place in an agency riddled at the top by private interests . President Carter , the Trilateral Commission alumnus , has insisted from the moment he took office that fuel prices must go higher , ever and ever higher , and the high command of his Department of Energy has been loaded with corporate types whose thinking has been molded by their industry background . " You do n't have to buy them , " - comments one consumer expert . " This is a much more sophisticated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power those types that think the corporate way . " Dr. James Schlesinger , Carter 's first Energy Secretary , became noted in Washington as one of the most arrogant bureaucrats this city of arrogant types has ever known . Throughout his regime , he faithfully parroted the A.P.I. 's line that there was an oil shortage ( when there was none ) and that higher prices were therefore justified . In the end , the truth caught up with this rhetoric . Last May 25 , when gas lines were clogging stations along the Eastern Seaboard , President Carter was compelled to , issue what appeared to be a stern directive to the Energy and the Justice Departments . By then there was widespread public suspicion that the big oil companies had created and manipulated a phony crisis , and the President ordered a full-fledged investigation : His order to the two departments read : " You shall jointly conduct a comprehensive investigation of the apparent gas shortage situation , using all available and appropriate authority and resources at your disposal , to determine whether there is reason to believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by firms at the refining and/or marketing level , or of excessive stockpiling or hoarding of supplies . " That order seemed to say that the President was n't going to stand for any nonsense ; he really wanted the truth . So what happened ? A Washington Post investigative team , after thoroughly questioning a number of D.O.E . employees , reported on August 12 that the President 's apparently stern order had been ignored by both Justice and the D.O.E . There had been no investigation ; there had been only what one top official who worked on the project called " a propaganda exercise . " This exercise produced a fifty-three-page report that was released by the White House under the imprimatur of Jimmy Carter . It cleared the oil industry . There had been no holding back of supplies , no attempt to create a crisis to jack up prices , it said . The A.P.I. naturally hailed the report as conclusive proof of its virginity , but The Washington Post described in explic it detail how this whitewash had been contrived . Some ten days after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summoned to the office of Deputy Secretary John F. O'Leary , who has since departed . There was a brief conference , and O'Leary handed over the chore of preparing the report to Lynn Coleman , the D.O.E . ' s general counsel . The report that finally went to the White House was put together almost exclusively by Coleman and Carlyle Hysted of the D.O.E . ' s policy branch . Hysted had been writing speeches and press releases for Schlesinger , and.his first draft of the " report " was almost a verbatim rendering of material he had already written . Since this would n't do , D.O.E . files were scrounged for material and footnotes that would give the final product some semblance of credibility . What had really happened , then , as The Washington Post disclosed , was that the D.O.E . and the Justice Department had deliberately ignored the President 's order . They had conducted no investigation , but had deceived the White House into issuing a phony report as authentic . Did the President blow his stack at having been flouted and deceived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't ; no , they did n't . One can only conclude that Jimmy Carter was not unhappy about a report that , whether it deceived him or not , was certainly intended to deceive the public . In tracing the spoor of this sham exercise , one is intrigued by the key role played , according to The Washington Post , by Coleman , who is still general counsel of the D.O.E . under the new Secretary , Charles W. Duncan . Coleman , before he joined the department , was a law partner in the large and highly influential Houston law firm of Vinson &; Elkins . Another partner in the firm was John Connally , currently seeking the White House . Connally 's millionaire status stemmed from his services to Sid Richardson , one of the original Texan oil tycoons . Coleman 's former law firm , according to Representative Dingell 's staff , has also in recent years represented some dozen companies whose cases have been referred to the Justice Department for price-control violations . Coleman 's former ties to a favorite law firm of the oil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he played when a young D.O.E . attorney in Houston , Joseph D. McNeff , attempted to expose the " daisy chain " oil scandal ( see Cook , " The Great Daisy Chain Scandal , " The Nation , July 7 ) . When McNeff spilled the story of how the oil companies were employing a bookkeeping shell game to convert " old " oil into higher-priced " new " oil to Michael Barrett , counsel for Representative Dingell 's energy committee , and Peter Stockton , one of Barrett 's top aides , the roof fell in . McNeff testified : " The General Counsel of the Department of Energy , Lynn Coleman , and a Deputy U.S. Attorney General , identified as a Mr. Keeney , relayed messages to me that under no circumstances were we to let your the committee 's investigators see any files or discuss any of the cases we were working on . If we did , we would be subject to prosecution . " The eagerness to ' muzzle McNeff has not been matched by a ? similar zealousness in tracking down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a symbol ' of many . The D.O.E . recognized it might have a problem in Denver . Kenneth Merica was its regional director there ; Edward Case was the area manager . Denver was the private turf of Marvin Davis , owner of one of the nation 's largest crude oil producers  --  and also owner of Summit Gas Company in Dallas , a major crude oil " reseller " under investigation in the daisy chain scam . In the latter part of 1977 , ' D.O.E . ' s National Office of Special Investigations began to suspect that Merica and Case were too chummy with Davis . An audit of Davis 's Denver company had been closed out in the record time of thirty-four hours . Despite the ' signs of a whitewash , D.O.E . made Merica acting regional director of the Dallas office , where the Summit investigation was centered . , John Arechiga was in charge of the D.O.E probe . Ironically , ? having sent Merica to Dallas , the department ordered Arechiga not to tell his new boss anything about his investigations . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's investigators , the Federal Bureau of Investigation and others , Merica offered him a $200,000 bribe to " foul up " the Summit and other reseller cases . When Arechiga turned down the bribe , he charged , Merica told him : " You 're in the big time . There is a lot at stake . It could be dangerous . If someone wanted to waste you , it could happen . " Arechiga claimed that Merica also intimated " something " could happen to his wife , arid family . adly shaken , Arechiga notified Herb Buchanan , deputy director of enforcement in the Dallas region . Buchanan told him to go to the F.B.I . Arechiga did . He asked the F.B.I . if they wanted to wire him for sound so that he could get Merica 's words on tape. , The F.B.I . was n't interested . Agents told Arechiga also that there was n't any , need to protect him and his family ; just leave everything to them . That was tht last Arechiga ' heard from the F.B.I . He did , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's investigators of suddenly receiving strict orders from Jerome Weiner , director of the department 's Office , of Special Investigations , not to contact the F.B.I . on any matter . Dingell 's subsequent investigation Showed that although Arechiga had gone to the F.B.I. , as he testified , on May 8 , 1978 , all the F.B.I . had done was query Weiner , then drop the case . Dingell wrote the Bureau on March 2 , 1979 , demanding to know what had happened in the , Merica investigation . Only under Congressional pressure did the , F.B.I . finally move . In May 1979 , a full year after Arechiga had notified the Bureau of Merica 's alleged bribe offer and threats , agents finally got around to taking the first step  --  interviewing Buchanan , to whom Arechiga , had originally told his story . After going through a few formal paces , the F.B.I . concluded that , though things looked fishy , there was n't enough evidence to justify prosecution . Subsequently , Dingell 's staff interviewed Arechiga . Here is an excerpt from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearly helpless in his effort to conduct special investigations He said his immediate supervisor , Ken Merica , offered him a bribe and threat. - ened his safety , so Merica could n't be trusted ; the regional counsel , Harold Clements , had personal connections with a target of a criminal investigation , so Clements could n't be trusted ; the National Office Director of Enforcement , Richard Herzog , appointed ' an employee under criminal suspicion to a critical job as enforcement director for the region , so Herzog could n't be trusted . Arechiga said he was very confused , and although he was investigating serious violations of the law he received no support from the critical DOE enforcement officials and was effectively prevented from doing an efficient job . Dingell 's staff concluded that nothing would ever happen in the case " because of the lack of a comprehensive investigation . " It added : " This problem and agency actions are consistent with the pattern of ineptness that ? prevails in the enforcement of the oil price control laws . " An investiggor familiar with this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and contempt of the , performance of the Justice Department : " They are like a bunch of eunuchs over there , " he says . " They are always searching for reasons to drop a case . They do n't pursue things aggressively to see if , they can make a case . " And the multibillion-dollar daisy chain ripoff continues . The Department of Energy , handmaiden of the oil companies , insists that the majors are n't involved . " They 're lying , " say Dingell 's aides . They have elaborate graphs showing how hundreds of , thousands of barrels of oil flow by circuitous routes , passing from hand to hand with a write-up in price for every transaction . The pipelines of some of the largest oiicompanies in the nation are the conduit for this flow , and the majors who own ' the essential pipelines get back the oil at world market prices after it has passed through the daisy chain . Yet nothing is done because , obviously , nothing is supposed to be done . Honest D.O.E . investigators , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hard way . - , t And hard-working Congressional staff people who have studied case after case , who know the full evil of the ' situation , are plainly disgusted . Some of them confess that they are ashamed to be working for such a Government . That is the final , damning word on the Administration of the phony populist , Jimmy Carter . ' ?
