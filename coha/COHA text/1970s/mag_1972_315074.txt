The networks . . . represent a concentration of power over American public opinion unknown in history . . . We 'd never trust such power in the hands of an elected government . It 's time we questioned it in the hands of a small and unelected elite . <P> - SpiroAgnew , 1969 <P> The Vice President 's famous speech in Des Moines , Iowa , was the opening blast in a sustained campaign by the Nixon Administration . Its aim : to chip away at the control exerted by the three major television networks over the programming they carry . That campaign received an uncalculated boost last year when the Federal Communications Commission limited the networks to three hours of evening prime-time programming ( leaving 550 local stations across the country to fill the other half-hour with programming of their own ) . The FCC also barred the networks from acquiring financial interests in outside programs being produced for their use . Last week , in a move that spread consternation and confusion , the Justice Department in effect put the industry on notice that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In federal court in Los Angeles , the department filed three far-reaching antitrust suits against the networks , claiming that they use their control of air time to block " free and open competition in the broadcasting of entertainment programs . " Specifically , the department said the networks monopolize prime time with shows and films they own or partly own , thus denying air time to competing producers , distributors and advertisers-or compelling them to give the networks a stake in their shows-and controlling the prices paid for TV rights to feature films . <P> The intention of the suits , said a spokesman , was twofold : " We want the networks to quit producing their own programs ; their own programs obviously have a better chance of getting on the air than somebody else 's programs , and that 's not fair . And we want them to quit bankrolling or buying syndication rights , or whatever , for outside productions . Obviously those productions have a better chance of getting on the networks too . " <P> Strictly speaking , none of the networks produce more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That is , each network buys about 90% of its prime-time shows from independent producers . But the FCC ban on financial interests in these outside productions has never really been effective , and even if it had , the networks could still retain interests in productions that were created before the agency ruled . The suits sought to prohibit all " ownership interests , " claiming that they applied in substantially more than half the prime-time shows broadcast by the networks . Oddly , the suits cited out-of-date ownership figures from the decade 1957-67 to support that claim .
