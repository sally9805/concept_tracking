ORIGAMI AEROPLANE A short story by Lowell Komie I HAD DINNER with Tennessee Williams once , " she said . She took a long strand of her hair and coiled it on her finger and then tossed the spiral of hair back over her shoulder . " I was working as an editor for a publishing house in New Orleans and I met Williams . We were doing a collection of his and we all went out one night . I did n't say much of anything to him . Oh , I remember after dinner we were standing in the parking lot , waiting for a taxi , and I said to him , The sky looks like a wound . ' " " A womb ? " " No . The sky looks like a wound . " " What did he say ? " " Nothing . He just looked up and smiled . " The man nodded and called the waitress over and ordered his first scotch . The woman ordered a glass of white wine and took a cigarette out and tapped it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was also there , " she added softly , and then suddenly she was quiet . She had a quick capacity for suddenly becoming quiet . She must be twenty-four or twenty-five , he thought as he watched her face illuminated by the flare of the match . He was fifty and divorced , with two children . They were in the first-floor bar just off the lobby of the Ritz in Boston . He was a senior editor with a Boston publisher and she 'd been sending him chapters of a novel for months . Finally he 'd written her a note and invited her to meet him after work for a drink . ' The bar of the Ritz at six on Thursday , " he 'd written on his house stationery . The next day le received a return note from her in a pale ) lue envelope of the Savoy in London with the address crossed out and her Boston address inierted . " D'aecord , " it said in a tiny , spiked andwriting that resembled his cardiogram . quiggle . The woman had pale ivory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of reticencethat was extremely appealing to him . She was looking down and away from him now as if she already regretted telling him about the evening with Williams . He wondered if she would get up and leave . He also noticed that she wore a gold serpentine ring and that the eyes of the serpent were green . She began to speak again . " I knew a man in New Orleans , he called himself an ' old fag ' but he was only fifty . Well , this man went home up North to visit his family . He had two weeks and he spent the first week just going to country fairs with his mother and his sisters , eating preserves and pies . I think his sisters were nuns . And then the second week he took off with another man and they came back down and really did New Orleans . The man he brought down with him was a tattooed man and he had only one leg . " She stared at him as if she were deciding whether or not the could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Well , when they got to New Orleans , the two of them went to their room and they began drinking , and then they decided to streak the hotel lobby . So they did . They streaked the lobby . " She smiled and blinked her eyes . She had very dark lashes that she lowered when she decided to be silent again . " How could a one-legged tattooed man streak a lobby ? " The lashes came up . She looked at him . " He did . " " I believe you . " She nodded . The man called to the waitress and ordered another scotch and the woman asked for a second glass of wine . " Have you met other famous writers ? " he asked her . " No . Have you ? " " A few , " he said . He leaned back in his chair and looked around the room . It was done in red velvet but he was feeling rather comfortable with the first scotch gone , almost as if he had climbed inside his cuff-link box @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What did you do last night ? " he asked her . " Oh , I combed the tangles in my cat . I had n't combed her for two weeks . " She looked up again . " Oh , all right , what did you do last night ? " " 1 do n't remember . I took my kids to a shopping center for dinner and there were all these little booths . One kid brought back caramel corn , another tacos . I had crepes and asparagus soup . Are you hungry ? Have you had dinner ? " " I 'm not really hungry . " She paused and drank her wine . " Why do n't you order . " She lit another cigarette and looked away from him . " Do you think they have a disco here ? " She moved her head with the movements of a disco heat and pursed her lips . " I do n't know . Do you disco ? " " I won a championship once at Harvard Law School . " She moved her head again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hall . " " You 're the Langdell Hall Disco Queen ? " " I think so . " " You are n't sure ? " " No , I 'm sure . " " I do n't know how to disco , " he said . " I like to dance , though . There 's music in the dining room . I saw them playing there . " " I do n't know how to slow dance , " she said . " You know , you have a quality of diffidence that I like . A quality of cool diffidence . The way you hold your head . The way you hold your cigarette . I see that quality in your writing , too . " " Thank you . " " I like your novel . Why do n't we get a room and talk about your writing . You can read from your manuscript . " " I thought you 'd never ask . " She looked at her watch . " We 've been together for five minutes . " " Are n't you into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room at the Ritz , " she said . " I do n't think that 's much of a risk . On a scale of risks , I 'd say that 's quite elegant . Some risks are inelegant , you know . " " I actually knew a man named Elegant , " he told her . " I used to swim at a club after work . He was always around the pool and constantly being paged on the loudspeaker . Mr. Elegant . Mr. Elegant , telephone call . ' I think he was a divorce lawyer and that was a way of advertising . " The man was really using up all his material now . That was the lodestone . " Have you ever heard of the Ritz house detective ? " she suddenly asked him . " He 's a dwarf and he keeps a cobra in the ventilating shafts . " She raised her eyebrows . " He feeds the cobra old rose petals from wedding bouquets . " " What 's his name ? " " The cobra 's name ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , perhaps . Charles of the Ritz . " " What 's Charles 's function ? Is he just deco-rative ? " " Oh , no . He 's sort of a thermostat . He pokes his head out of a vent whenever passion rises in a room . He 's attracted by any kind of passionate sigh or groan . " " I see , What 's the name of the dwarf detec-tive ? " " Wee Willie . Wee Willie of the Ritz . " " What 's the name of your cat ? " He reached out and touched her hand for the first time . " My cat ? My cat 's name is Peter . " " That 's a pleasant name . Did you name him after a lover ? " She took a deep breath , looked at him , blinked several times , and tapped her cigarette , once , twice , and then she quietly said to him , " I know this Dutch clairvoyant in New York City that I visited last year who told me I was going to marry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 'd move back down South and I 'd begin my doctorate and he 'd teach at the law school . " He noticed , though , that she was standing as she told him this and she was holding her carryall and her raincoat in her hands . " I know you think I 'm laid back , " she said , " but I never thought you 'd take me literally . " She smiled and touched hi ! hand with the finger that bore the serpent ring " Do you have a reservation for this reading ot are you just talking ? " T HEY WALKED through the lobby am she waited for him by the cigar start ( while he went to the desk and asket for a room . When he returned , she wa inspecting a box of chocolates with a pink sill how . He flashed the key hidden in his palm a her and she nodded . They met at the elevate " Did you have any trouble ? " she asked a the elevator door closed . They were alone . , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and nodded again . She het her big bag with both her arms folded aroun it in front of her . He could see that there were at least two large manuscripts in the bag . " Do you detect a scent in here ? " he asked her and sniffed . " I 've heard that they spray the elevators at each Ritz Hotel with the same fragrance . " She sniffed . " I do n't smell anything . " " It 's true . They spray all of them with a special fragrance . " The doors opened and they went to the room . He hung the DO NOT DISTURB sign on the doorknob . The sign was written in four languages , English , French , German , and Arabic . One of them should do the trick , he thought , and went into the bathroom . He could hear her talking to someone , but when he came out she was alone . " Who were you talking to ? " he asked her . She was sitting in a chair by the window @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glasses on and she held a manuscript in her lap . " Wee Willie . the house detective . He was here checking us out . " " The dwarf detective . " She nodded . " He left us this . " She pointed to a bottle of champagne in a bucket with two glasses on a table . " This is a nice room , is n't it , " she said . She adjusted her glasses and turned on the TV set without sound . using it for light instead of a lamp . She opened her manuscript and began to page through it . He went into the bathroom again , got a hand towel , and opened the champagne and poured them each a glass . " What did Willie look like ? " he asked her . " He was very tiny and he had rose petals on his shoulders , also his head was wrapped in a turban with a great big diamond in the center . " " Did he have tattoos ? " " No . He was just a plain little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he say anything about the cobra ? " " He just said , ' Welcome to the Ritz , ' in a tiny squeaky voice , and he asked to see our key . " She pulled her legs up underneath her and adjusted her skirt . She also lit another cigarette and began to read aloud to him . He took his jacket off and then removed his shoes and sat back on the bed with pillows propped against the headboard and watched her . She had a nice reading voice , just a trace of a southern accent . The shadows of the figures on television flickered across her face as she read . He closed his eyes and pretended to be listening with great acuity . Actually , he was thinking about how he could ask her to leave her reading and come to bed with him withoutreally disturbing her . She was like a young butterfly that was only resting for a moment and he was afraid that his least gesture might offend her and she 'd flutter out the door . Finally , he decided she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her , " Why do n't you put the manuscript aside ? " She did n't answer him . She became quiet and looked at him for a long time and then she tore out a manuscript page and began slowly folding it . " What are you doing ? " He sipped some more champagne . She looked quite beautiful to him in the gray light of the TV . " You 'll see . " She kept folding the page and then when she had it folded into a neat little paper glider , she tossed it at him . She tore out a second page and began folding it . " I hope you have copies of those , " he said and sipped the champagne again . He wriggled his toes and tossed the paper glider back at his big toe . " I think this one is better . Aerodynamically speaking . " She walked to the window and raised it . She stood with her back to him at the open window and then she put her hand out into the darkness . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Why do n't you step back from the window , " he asked her gently . She took a match and lit the tail of the second paper glider and tossed it out the window . " Origami aeroplane , " she said to him . She stood watching the flame until it disappeared and then she stepped back and shut the window . Now she came over to him and sat on the edge of the bed and slowly removed her necklaces , and began unpinning her hair . She leaned over him and dropped her necklaces on the night table , As she bent over-him , her hair fell loosely around his face . He thought he saw the green eyes of her serpent ring flash at him from beneath the silken umbrella of her hair , or was it a separate pair of hooded eyes staring at him ? When she kissed him tentatively , he did n't sigh . He made absolutely no sound . He was beneath her with her back shielding him . If the cobra came hissing out now from the vent attracted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take the lethal sting . He held his breath between tightly compressed lips . He may be sexist , that he knew , even perhaps a sexual adventurist , but it was all part of the literary game and he was an old hand . H there was magic abounding in the room , these were her friends and he knew enough to lie still and be very quiet .
