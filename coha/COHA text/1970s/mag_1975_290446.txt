The lifelong reader of the Los Angeles Times was outraged . " You are the Paul Revere of the oncoming avalanche of libertine behavior , " he wrote in a letter to the editor canceling his subscription . Lest anyone fail to recognize the disgruntled reader 's name , the Times responded last week by identifying him in a cartoon lampooning his decision . It was hardly necessary , for everyone knows that Edward Michael Davis , 58 , is the city 's chief of police . Tilting with the Times-and anyone else who runs up against his puritan ethics-is standard operating procedure for Davis . To him advocates of gun control are " quacks " ; legislators who support less than draconian marijuana laws are " irresponsible , no-good sons of bitches . " <P> Gunsmoke Rhetoric . Such volleys , delivered in surprisingly temperate tones , have won U.S.C. Grad Davis the enmity of civil libertarians and the politicians who are his targets . They have also earned him the uncontested ranking of toughest talking big-city cop in the U.S. Today 's police chiefs generally take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with intractable urban crime . Ed Davis ' gunsmoke rhetoric revives memories of Birmingham 's Bull Connor and his L.A. predecessor Bill Parker , who once said that as far as he was concerned any suspect picked up was guilty until proven innocent . <P> The Davis penchant to shoot from the lip tends to obscure the fact that he heads one of the more innovative and efficient police forces in the country . Crime is rising in Los Angeles at an annual rate of 7%-only half the nationwide rate of increase . And Davis deserves much of the credit . An admirer of Sir Robert Peel , who founded Britain 's nonviolent and respected police system , Davis follows the British practice of running a strong community-relations program . He gets his cops into living rooms to talk crime prevention and build trust . " It 's working , " says City Councilman Bob Farrell , a black who represents part of the crime-ridden south-central section of the city . <P> But Davis ' stance on gun control is something else again . He says that all too many of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serious threat to law-and-order . Respectable citizens , he says , should arm themselves to ward off domestic terrorism , and to be ready for some as yet undefined coastal invasion . Pot smokers also rank high on the chief 's enemies ' list . Last spring Davis dispatched 75 officers to a series of rock concerts , and they rounded up over 500 fans . <P> Security Company Executive Tom Reddin , whom Davis succeeded as L.A. 's top cop , thinks his protg 's bark is worse than his bite . Says Reddin : " People may remember him by his statements rather than his accomplishments . " City Attorney Burt Pines certainly will . Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley , a 1964 classmate of Davis at the police academy , recently had to negotiate a truce after Davis attacked Pines for being " soft " on pornographers , and Pines struck back , questioning the chief 's professionalism in making charges without evidence . Last week Davis zeroed in on bigger game . Democratic National Chairman Robert Strauss revealed that one reason the party chose New York over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chief would overreact to demonstrations , Davis reacted by resigning from the party .
