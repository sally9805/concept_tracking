" The most significant environmental legislation in the history of Congress , " said Ohio Representative William Harsha . " The means to eliminate the cancer of water pollution , " said Senator Edmund Muskie of Maine . With such encomiums , the Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972 swept through Congress last week by 74-0 in the Senate and 366-11 in the House . Despite this massive approval , the big question was : Would President Nixon sign the bill into law ? <P> There can be no doubt of the act 's importance . It aims at nothing less than the end of pollution of U.S. waterways by 1985 . The problem is money . Congress provides a cornucopia-the act calls for spending of $24.6 billion over the next three fiscal years . That amount is almost three times as much as the White House has recommended . Indeed , Administration experts term the act " inflationary , " and some have publicly advised the President to veto it . <P> Acrimony . The act itself is the product of months of argument . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ House approved a milder bill in March . The legislation then underwent a full 39 conference committee sessions , many of them long and acrimonious . After all that , says Representative Robert Jones , chairman of the House conference committee : " The bill is more effective than either the House or Senate bills . " <P> The essential ingredients for the great cleanup are all there . Every sort of pollutant , from heavy metals like mercury and cadmium to heated water from electricity plants , is defined and limited . The bill provides up to $18 billion for municipalities to build new sewage-treatment plants , with 75% of the money being paid by Washington and 25% by states and cities . It would finance the removal of toxic sludge from river and lake bottoms and also provide low-interest loans to small businesses for antipollution equipment . <P> The cleanup would take place in two stages . By July 1 , 1977 , industries would have to install the " best practicable " antipollution devices on all their waste systems . " Practicable " means what industry can afford-or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In effect , Congress is promising that the need for antipollution equipment would not put small and antiquated plants out of business , but it is also warning that even relatively unprofitable factories must begin to curb their wastes . The real crunch would come with the second deadline . By July 1 , 1983 , all industries must upgrade their antipollution equipment to make use of the " best available " technology-even if it is expensive . <P> <P> " You are the enforcer , " said President Nixon when he appointed William D. Ruckelshaus as the EPA 'S first administrator . The clean-water act uses him as just that . His biggest job would be to police the efforts of the individual states , which would be directly in charge of the cleanup . The states would issue permits , written to meet EPA standards , specifying limits on every plant that discharges wastes into waterways . If a state is too lenient with a polluter-violations can cost $25,000 a day ( plus a year in jail for plant officials ) - the EPA chief could intervene and even take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
