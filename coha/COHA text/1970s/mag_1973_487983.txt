C.P. Ellis is president of the Durham , N.C. chapter of the United Klans of America , Inc . He is also president of his local union , which he insists he organized on an integrated basis . He continues , to " love George Wallace as a man , and for what he said " ; but as a member of Durham 's Human Relations Commission , he advocates stronger enforcement powers for the city 's anti-discrimination agency , because " It 's hard to get people to do what they ought to on racial matters . We need to encourage ' em to do what they ought to do . " A political split personality ? Not when placed in the context of the rapid but ' uneven pace of change in the South today . An unprincipled opportunist ? Hardly , though the charge will continue to be hurled at C.P. Ellis from both left and right . This man 's struggle toward his present political eclecticisin makes vivid the limitations of our prevailing political categories and social assumptions . His life , a product @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economic institutions , is as revealing of the current state of these institutions as any bare structural analysis is ever likely to be . Claiborne P. Ellis springs from roots that are indistinguishable from those of the bulk of Southern poor whites . His parents left , the economic uncertainties of farm life to work for , the low but steady , wages offered by a small textile mill in rural North Carolina . When this factory closed , they moved On to other mill jobs in " the city . " Most of the work force in Durham 's flourishing textile and tobacco industries shared their rural heritage , which emphasized fundamentalism in religion and a rugged individualism in economics . This latter cultural belief ( with its insistence that , when it came to earning ' one 's living , every man got precisely what he deserved ) must have seemed somewhat less ' credible in an ' impersonal industrial center than it had in communities of small , individual farms . But if the working out of its logic sometimes seemed excessively harsh to these new urbanites , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of individuals far more undeserving than themselves : the rootless blacks who could not even secure monotonous mill jobs . Ellis ' father hoped that his son could escape the mills by staying in school long enough to attract the attention of a major-league baseball scout . But the boy 's athletic ambitions were curtailed in the ' 8th grade , when his father died of a respiratory ailment . ( He believes that his Edward McConville has spent the last three years working as a conznzunity organizer with 0E0 and free-lance reporter in the South . He has been actively involved in a number of union organizing campaigns in North Carolina , and plans to specialize in the reporting of labor relations after doing graduate work in journalism at Northwestern University . ) father 's , shortness of breath was caused by inhalation of cotton dust on the job .. Company-financed medical researchers had not yet " discovered " byssinosis , or brown lung disease . ) Like many another young poor white then and today , Ellis did not immediately resent the economic imperatives which forced him to leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his personal interests and vocational needs , and which , at its worst , seemed determined to destroy his self-esteem . As the South 's economic base was broadening from manufacturing to service industries , Ellis was able to avoid mill work by finding , a series of jobs as salesman and service-station attendant . He married at 19 , to begin what he describes as a " bitter struggle " to support his wife and four children , one of them blind and retarded . Some of the pressure was relieved when he opened his own gas station , but a heart attack forced him to sell it . Today , at 46 , he works as a semi-skilled plumber and handyman at Duke University , Durham 's largest employer . Ellis ' inevitable resentment at the economic severity of his life found a familiar outlet , and in the 1960s he made an organizational affiliation common at the time among all but the more apathetic men of his class . " All my life , I 've loved people , when it comes to individuals , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the South , was taught - to , hate niggers , was taught that they were the enemy , and I was taught that they were trying to steal the white woman . . . . I could n't stand to see these blacks come up in ' higher positions than I was . And we were fighting it . It was a fight ' for , self-respect . And I got bitter and I got mad and I wanted to do something to stop it , and I joined ' the Klan . Couple of years I was vice president . Third year I was the president in Durham . I joined it because I ' wanted to stop what I honestly thought was wrong . " Ellis does not deny having made violent assaults upon blacks . While he has arrived at a painful understanding of the social causes of racial violence , he makes no attempt to evade the moral responsibility stemming from his personal involvement in it . Neither does he let his sense of guilt for past ' actions paralyze his efforts to chart a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough to follow him . If the Klan has its well-publicized ugly side , it also serves some legitimate social functions . For locker- and lower-middle-class Southern males , membership in the Klan has long provided the only secular arena in which they have been able to exert whatever leadership capabilities they might possess . It also renders various services to the poor white community , ranging from charitable activities to an informal counseling and crisis-intervention service . As a Klan leader , Ellis is expected to help ' solve the marital , occupational and financial problems of his constituents . He has spent an increasing portion of his time in recent years interceding with school officials on behalf ' of worried parents , who feel more ' alienated than ever from the public school system . It was his involvement with school problems that eventually propelled him far beyond his accustomed ideological orbit . From his earliest days in the Klan , he began to question the organization 's extreme willingness to do favors for the affluent white leadership of Durham , and that leadership 's unspoken assumption that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , theirs to reap the resulting benefits . Almost immediately after assuming the presidency of the Durham Klan , he persuaded its membership to adopt a policy of open political participation at public meetings . This practice of clearly identifying oneself as a Klansman , putting forward a " Klan position " on a particular issue , represented a sharp break with the group 's ' traditionally secretive methods of operation . Ellis hoped that the use of open advocacy would make poor whites the beneficiaries of their own political initiatives . Predictably , however , the Durham Klan 's open appearance on the political stage only further convinced him of his organization 's completely subordinate position in Southern politics . " My people are becoming part ' of the oppression I helped to create , " he said recently , recalling his early tenure at the head of the Klan . After a brief , painful pause he continued , ruefully recounting example after example of his manipulation at the hands of the local power structure . Politicians and prominent businessmen would call to tell him that a group of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or that , and would he please make sure the Klan was there , " to balance things out " ? " We would show up with our guns in our belts , " he said . " And then the next day I would see the same city official on the street and expect him to come up and thank me . And instead he would cross to the other side of the street to keep ' from meeting me . I found out that we were being used to keep those folks in power . And I decided that we were n't going to be used any more . " C.P. Ellis ' disillusionment with his class 's traditional understanding of their economic and social roles grew to uncomfortable proportions . " There was a constant turmoil going on inside of me . I 'd lay awake many nights , thinking about what I should do . I did n't know which way to go . " It was while he was in this frame of mind that he was approached with an unusual invitation , one that a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much less to accept . The North Carolina AFL-CIO had received a grant from the federal government in 1971 , to sponsor a " charette " ( a ten-day series of mass discussions and encounter-group workshops ) focusing on community attitudes toward Durham 's newly integrated school system . The idea was to get people from every sector of the community to agree to come together and listen to one another 's complaints and fears about the sometimes unbearable tension in the schools . It was hoped that the exchange so produced would lead black and white parents to see that they shared many of the same concerns about their schools . The - organizers of the project decided to select the charette 's co-chairmen from the opposite ends of Durham 's political and racial spectra . That meant Ellis , who at the time was still making stridently conservative statements , and Ann Atwater , a huge black woman who was considered an extremist even in her own community . Despite his desperate search for alternatives to conventional Klan activities , Ellis remained an unabashed racist , ' and was reluctant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was very difficult for me to agree to work with Ann Atwater , who at one time was my most bitter enemy . I hated her guts , so to speak , because any time I 'd go downtown she 'd be boycotting some white merchant . It would n't take long for her to run ' em out of business , too . I really hated her . . ' But I saw in this school program an opportunity to help some white people who 'd been calling me ' almost constantly with problems in the schools , saying , " Now you 're the head of the Klan ; help us with this . " And I would always respond . I 'd go to the superintendent , the principal and the teacher . And many times it was not something racial ; just the school not giving the boy a chance . But they would shake . They were afraid . You know , the word " Klan " just scared those superintendents . And one time " when I 'd come on the school grounds , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hauled off . ' Fraid there was going to be a racial fight . So I began working in this program ; began working with people who I 'd been opposed to . Local anti-poverty workers sneered at the charette as a naive attempt to apply group therapy techniques to what were essentially social conflicts , an approach which they believed would result in defusing poor people 's anger at the representatives of the local power structure on the school board . Their assumption , that low-income parents of either race were more interested in storming City Hall than in improving the atmosphere for their children 's education , is highly questionable . Conservatives , on the other hand , saw the structured forum as a tinderbox , which could result in anything but the preservation of Durham 's ( and , by extension , the South 's ) status quo . Ms. Atwater was ' accused by blacks of " selling out " by working with a Klansman . Nor was the poor white community overjoyed by the spectacle of their unofficial spokesman publicly associating with a black woman . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ellis . " And they 'd threaten me and say , ' Now we 're goin ' t ' kill you , you so n ' so . You 're ' co-operatin ' , with niggers and liberals and we 're , goin ' to kill you . ' I said , ' Well , you 'll have to get in line , buddy , ' cause you 're not the first call I 've received today . ' " It is difficult to measure the overall effect of the school charette on Durham race relations , but there can be no doubt that it profoundly altered the racial attitudes of C.P. Ellis . He came to the early sessions bristling with resentment : " Some of the teachers , " he recalls , " had looked down their noses at our children because we were Klansmen , because I was a leader here in Durham , because I was outspoken . My boy had two or - three liberal teachers . And this one liberal teacher , every chance he got he 'd cut at me in front of the class @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afternoon in literal tears because of the way he was treated . This discouraged my boy . In fact , he almost wanted to quit school . But he was n't old enough . I said , ' Son , do n't quit .. Keep on . ' " - But before Ellis could express his outrage ' at the teacher 's misuse of his classroom , Ann Atwater rose to speak . " I began to hear her talk about her daughter , especially , " he remembers : Her daughter was looked down upon and discriminated against in school by some of her black teachers because she ? Ms. Atwater was a black militant . And she would tell how her daughter , would come home sometimes crying in the afternoon . And I thought , Why , same thing 's , happening to my boy . See , because I was a , militant Klansman , my boy was being treated worse than the dickens . And I began to hear , I never will forget , a young black giiI standing before one of our committees , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood before the class and openly said , ' You are stupid . . . . ' And I thought , my God , what would that do to me ? And I began to see . I not only began to hear whit people were saying , but I could ' feel ' it see ? How would I , feel if I was in her place ? As I began to see that these black people had the same basic , feelings that ' I had , I said , " Here we have been fighting , one another for years but . we 're all in the same boat , and we been catching hell from the same crowd that has control . " And I just simply began to see ' that they were human beings just like I was , but with a different colcir and a different culture . Ms. Atwater responded in similar terms to Ellis ' expressions of angry concern over the schools ' handling of poor white students . The result has been an effective and continuing working relationship . The unlikely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having " school problems " of their own . Their bi- , . racial dialogue proved to be a catalyst which often provoked " violent reactions " from their listeners . They were confronted by one hostile , racially mixed audience in a Pittsburgh television studio . " There was a big black man with an African haircut , " recalled Ellis . " After we had turned it over for . questions , he began to roar . I mean he was so loud he shook the audience , we was in . ' We 're ' gon na ' burn fall the schools down , the City Hall , and this damn television station . ' So Ann set there and listened to him , and she said , ' Why do n't you shut up long enough for somebody to talk some , sense ' ? And this fella ' just melted like an ice-cream cone in a fire . And before that meeting was over ; he had a cooperative attitude . And I had to tell some of the white people who were saying things like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with these ' damn niggers . ' I mean they would say it openly on television . I said , ' Well , now folks , lemme tell you something . We been through it down South . We did n't want to go to school with them " damn niggers , " either . But we realized that this is federal law . We realized that we must abide by the law . Now do n't come , crying on our shoulder . Do n't point your fingers at us . You people do what we had to do and shut up . ' And as a result of this , these people were actually talking to ' one another . Now people say , ' ' That 's an impossible dream . ' I do n't believe it 's impossible because I 've seen it happen too many times . . . . Damn , I 'm tired of fighting . I can fight . I got guns , got . , one in my car . I can fight if I have to . But I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fighting . I 'm tired of fighting people in the same economic status I 'm in . I 'm ready to turn the guns on somebody else . The ' figurative ' guns , as they say . " Experienced organizers point , out ' that " getting it all together " is only the ' first , and in many ' cases the easiest , step ' , in the long process of securing social change . The formulation and implementation ' of strategies to force shifts in the balance of power is generally much more difficult . Nor should it be supposed that either C.P. Ellis or Ann Atwater speak for anything approaching a majority of their respective racial communities . But given the social and racial history of the South , their personal collaboration can Only be seen as the clearing of an extremely important initial ? hurdle , without which there could be no realistic discussion of various appro , aches to further obstacles .  - -   - -   ,  - -   - -   ' - Shortly after the charette , Lloyd Jacobs , a more conventional Klansman and long-time " law and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to contest ' Ellis ' local presidency . Jacobs ' campaign stressed the need for ' a return to racial orthodoxy . Klan elections are usually pro forma affairs , much like stockholder or union elections , with more than 90 per cent of the votes generally going to the incumbent . Ellis retained his office by a modest majority of 60 per cent of the ballots cast , and he owed his relatively narrow victory more to personal loyalties and the membership 's respect for his leadership abilities than to any ideological agreement . But a handful of Durham 's Klansmen have begun to move to his , politico-racial position , which identifies the white businessman , rather than the destitute black , as the primary cause of the poor whites ' overwhelming economic troubles . As of the last local election , held in December 1972 , Ellis had reconsolidated his support so completely that no one bothered to run against him . North Carolina 's state affiliate to the United Klans has failed to invite him to the last two statewide meetings . Rather than permanently antagonize a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he chooses not to force the issue of his chapter 's disenfranchisement . Support has come to C.P. Ellis from unexpected quarters in the last few years . " When white people had problems they needed help with in the city , a lot of times I would approach a certain white legislator with the problems and he would n't give me any help . So I said , ' O.K. , I 'll turn around and call some black man . ' And immediately he 'd respond to my needs and get behind it and help this person I wanted to help . Now , how can I help but respect the black politician who 'll help me when the white one wo n't ? He helped me be- , cause he 's been through it himself . He knows what it is to have problems when nobody 'd help him with ' em . " Several influential black Democrats privately supported Ellis when he ran for the Durham County School Board in 1972 . The hard-headed Durham Committee on Negro Affairs ( DCNA ) did not endorse him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , more to the point , because Ellis could not promise to deliver any significant number of poor white votes to the black candidate . But the mere fact that a Klansman went before a caucus of black politicians to bargain is a major step in a totally new direction. , Ellis ' advocacy of joint economic initiatives by low-income blacks and whites is expressed concretely in his union activities . Effectively blocked in the textile mills , the Southern labor movement has redirected its organizing energies toward the region 's burgeoning service industries . Few service jobs are covered by federal minimum wage laws . The cost of living in most of the urban Southeast , long cited by industry as a justification for its Southern " wage differential , " has risen to levels approaching those in Northern cities . These developments have not been lost on C.P. Ellis . " Until recent years , I was very opposed to organized labor , " he said . " I looked at some of the leaders as radicals , far-out left wingers . Maybe Wilbur state AFL-CIO president Wilbur Hobby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for us to have opportunities for a decent life , we 're going to have to become radical . I 'm convinced of that . " When more than 700 black campus and hospital workers at Duke gained union recognition and an equitable contract from the university in early 1972 , Ellis realized that he and his counterparts in the maintenance department would also need the protection of collective bargaining . Faced with a budget squeeze , a university , like any other institution , concentrates its savings on the points of least resistance . Ellis approached the International Union of Operating Engineers ( IUOE ) , which quickly sent in an organizer . A union representation election was scheduled for December 5 , 1972 . Since he estimated that nearly 80 per cent of the employees in the bargaining unit stipulated by the NLRB 's electiOn order were either Klan members or sympathizers , Ellis felt no compelling need to court the votes of black maintenance workers . However , he wanted to minimize any divisive racial tensions within his own untested local , and between it and the black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he insisted that his International " send down a black representative , so that he and I could go around and visit the black workers to show them that we wanted them in this thing right from the start " Of the eighty-eight validated ballots , seventy indicated a preference for union representation . During the protracted contract negotiations which followed the election , Ellis constantly reminded his co-workers that their union would need the loyalty of every man in the maintenance department if it was to press their demands effectively . " It 's helped out , not only me , " he said of the experience shortly before he signed his local 's first contract on May 16 , " but it 's helped every white man in the bargaining unit , because we realize now that some of our strongest supporters in the maintenance department are black people . " . Ellis believes that this kind of awakening among poor whites is " very disturbing to those who are in control , because they know that once we can get past some of the deep , built-in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together in some mass movement , their days are numbered . We 're going to have people in office that really represent poor people . They 're aware of this , and I believe that the officials in the city of Durham are shaking in their boots over the possibility of it happening . " In what he believes was an attempt to co-opt " the possibility of it happening , " the City Council offered Ellis a position on Durham 's Human Relations Commission at the end of 1972 . He accepted , and , as he gleefully relates , " I turned on them that put me on there , and now they do n't know what they 're going to do with me . " Rather than creating a stalemate with black commission members over the occurrence of discrimination in specific instances , he has acknowledged its widespread practice in Durham and pushed for greater authority to punish racial discrimination in housing , employment and public accommodations . Durham 's tiny liberal community has responded to Ellis ' initiatives with a great deal of ambivalence . The older @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remain unaware of local political realities , can appreciate the quality of his social courage and the opportunities it may some day afford them . This experienced nucleus realizes that an electoral alliance with the county 's large number of powerless poor whites offers liberals their only possible escape from an inconsequential minority status . " Jack Preiss and Elizibeth Tornquist have been wonderful to me these last few years , " says Ellis . " They've-encouraged me in what I was doing . " Preiss is a Duke sociologist whose talent for devising effective political strategies has served him well both as a city councilman and as chairman of the local McGovern organization . Ms. Tornquist is a writer and consultant with an intimate ' knowledge of Durham politics . , . Howevei , the majority of Durham 's liberals are much less aware of the nature of their city 's social ills . Relatively young , occupationally and geographically mobile , and more often than not connected with Duke University ( which chooses to see itself as an island of Northern rationality in a sea of Southern madness ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issues than in working to shape local ones . Given this " broad , " unfocused outlook , they generally regard Ellis with an attitude at once blase and moralistic . " Well , it 's about time one of those people did something decent , " many of them seem to be saying . Their guilty response to the ra , cial oppression of one group of poor people has produced a vindictive toleration for the economic exploitation of another . The selective social conscience which seems to characterize all too many liberals has seriously damaged their credibility in the eyes of Southern workingmenlike Ellis . " The greatest damage the liberal in this country today has done , " says Ellis , " is to talk about discrimination , but to do nothing about it when it 's some white man involved . For years they 've been telling me , ' Let 's look past the color ; let 's look past the length of the hair ; let 's not put a label on people . ' And finally I got to the place where I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . ' But then they could n't do it , see ? They could n't look past my Klan label and give me a chance . And I 've said to them , ' You 're a ' damn liar , and you wo n't do it . You do n't believe in equal opportunities for everybody . ' And that 's what 's made the average citizen bitter at the liberal today . " Ellis ' penchant for provocative statements has done nothing to , improve his , image among some potential allies . When a controversy arose over the public school 's ban on some cherished relics of the Southern past , he said with complete sincerity , " You know , these kids were raised in the South , and to them , you know , ' Dixie ' and the Confederate flag was just part of their culture . And to many , of them it does n't mean anything more racial than the black and green and red flag means to black kids . That 's something the blacks can relate to . All right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is just something that they can relate to . In order to build understanding in America today , we 've got to come to the place where we can say , O.K. , ' let us have this . If you want to relate to Martin Luther King or Malcolm X , then that 's your thing ; you relate to that . But you 're not gon na ' take away what we want and you have what you want ! " This argument for cultural pluralism and tolerance is no less reasonable than those advanced by many other ethnic groups and subcultures , past and present . However , in an era when social issues , are perceived largely in terms of symbol , and when certain groups are assumed to be the sole repositories of good or evil , such a statement can not but seem the epitome , of racist obscurantism to many less than dispassionate observers . Ellis describes his positions on most issues as radical . And , by comparison with those held by about every other public figure in North Carolina today , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and therefore of politics , is more akin to liberalism than Marxism . He believes that " Our system of government is a good system of government , if it was run like it ought to be run . I do n't want to destroy capitalism . I want private industry to continue to exist , but I want them to give us a fair share of what 's being taken home . . . . I guess I 'm bitter . I 'm bitter because I look back over the years and I see what 's happened to the workingman , what 's happened to the poor man . Now , many people do n't have the ability to move ' up , or they have no desire to move up . But I 'm bitter because those who want to move up are not being given an opportunity to , because of the fact that they have a label , because of the fact that , economically , they 're at the bottom of the ladder . Many of those people have the ability to climb up that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I 'm just simply mad as hell about it . . . . I hope there 's some way for America , that we can get us to get it together , not to take over and destroy our system of government , but to make the folks give us a damn opportunity . " The question of opportunity lies at the core of C.P. Ellis ' hopes and anxieties , and comprises the central element in his political thinking . It is the common ideological root from which all of his seemingly incompatible viewpoints spring . He sees a biracial mass movement as an absolutely necessary step , not in a revolutionary process leading to economic equality but in the direction of increased opportunity for those individuals with the skill and initiative to take advantage of it . If he admires George Wallace , it is because the Alabama Governor was the first major political figure to raise a question concerning the denial of opportunity to the families of blue-collar ' workers . ( He also feels that Wallace can never be the political savior that many poor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ views preclude the possibility of his ever taking part in a black-white coalition . ) Ellis accepted organized labor , when he realized that wage earners must possess a secure economic foundation before either they or their . children can even begin to think about advancement . In his role as a Human Relations Commissioner , he can sympathize with blacks who encounter discrimination in the job market , because their feelings of anger and hopelessness reflect his own when confronted with the lack of basic opportunities . ? His attitude toward the problem of crime and violence , is a direct outgrowth of his concern with the issue of equal opportunity . " This country created this monster , violence and crime , " he said . " I believe , basically , because they wo n't give people an opportunity . I think about the black man who stood on top of the Holiday Inn in New Orleans and shot seven white people . My immediate reaction was , ' That black son of a bitch ! ' But then I think . I say , Wait a minute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bitter , disappointing experiences I 've been through in my life , and that 's the reason he 's up there . ' Why do Klan people get out there in the corn field and have speeches and rallies ? Why do they become Violent ? Why do they sometimes kill ? ' Cause nobody wants to listen . Nobody wants to give ' em a chance . Basically , I believe that everybody has something he wants to contribute to America . And once you try to say something and people turn their back on you , and make little of you and your abilities , it makes you mad . " Most blacks and white liberals remain skeptical of Ellis because of his " label , " but the leadership of these groups respects him as a person and a potential political force . Some people take an " Is this nut for real ? " approach , while it is probably true that most Durhamites just plain do n't know what to make of him . Whether they understand his political positions or not , many poor whites @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ larger society without denying his class and regional origins . Southern liberals seek America 's acceptance by dissociating themselves from all things Southern . This position is impossible for someone from Ellis ' background . C.P. Ellis is not a typical Klansman , not even a typical Southerner . But he may be a prophetic one . He hardly fits the description of the legendary town crank , who came by his odd , progressive ideas in an isolated corner of the local public library . His ideological transformation was a response to social and economic conditions whichare becoming more prevalent in the South today . " I was n't made to change , " he said . " I changed because I saw the necessity for it . I had , to change . " The diversification of the region 's once monolithic economy , an increase in the number of integrated work places , and the rise oftrade unionism have combined to offer the promise of renewed opportunity to large numbers of Southern workingmen . Many of them originally joined the Klan becutse , like ' Ellis , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white trash . " If these emerging opportunities can be expanded and kept reasonably open , the most determined of these men will inevitably duplicate his adoption of those alternative modes of thinking and acting which may lead to greater economic security and social respect . However , if these new-found doors to personal and collective advancement are completely closed to poor whites ( whether by industrialists , conservative politicians or the increasingly influential liberals ) , the future social development of the South will bear a grim resemblance to its past . , ?
