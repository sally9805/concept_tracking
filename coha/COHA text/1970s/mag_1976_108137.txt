I come walking out of a back room at Boston 's New England Aquarium , dressed like a frogman , and sit down on the tiny dock above the Giant Ocean Tank , the world 's largest glass aquarium . My two diving partners , aquarium staff members Bob Griffin ( right ) and Toni Pollack , are already in the water . I put in my legs . The water is 76 ? , a median temperature acceptable to the large ocean animals from Cape Cod to Key West with which the tank is stocked . // Something large is rising . " They 'll be curious about somebody new coming in , " Griffin had said . " The turtles are interested in air bubbles . The sharks will sense your vibrations , and smell you . As they approach , they actually will be tasting you to see if you 're good to eat . " // The shape continues to rise . Remain calm . Know hysteria , and assimilate it . " Sharks are keenly aware of erratic behavior , " Griffin had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Atlantic green sea turtle the size of a water bed is homing in on it . Ah , yes . I glance at the schoolchildren peering over the railing , watching the divers . Pollack grabs the 500-pound turtle by its shell , perhaps a fin length from my foot , and steers it slowly downward like a mover edging a piano into the parlor . " That was Myrtle , " she says coming up . " She 's crazy . " // I am in a little deeper now , up to my chest , my mask and oxygen regulator in place . I can feel the gentle current from right to left . Forms drift past counterclockwise , against the flow . " Aerodynamically , it 's easier for most fish to swim into a current , " Griffin had explained . " Watch out for the traffic when you get down there . " // My head goes under and suddenly pops out . " A lot of divers get claustrophobia when they start in , " Roz Ridgway , the public relations woman , had said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lou Garibaldi put it . // I feel as though I have just viewed a caldron of slowly stirred sea monsters . Beneath me five- and six-foot sharks circle alongside giant turtles , tarpon and barracuda . On the bottom are things that resemble boulders , 400-pound jewfish . There are more than 250 animals in the 23-foot-deep , 40-foot-wide , 200,000-gallon circular tank . // How can a sane person descend into such company ? " Well , " said Toni Pollack , in the kind of inverted logic that seemed so reasonable on land , " the turtles are probably more dangerous than the sharks . " // Now as we sink past the fiber-glass reef that fills the center of the tank , its grottoed and tunneled form pulsing with marine life that one would n't mind seeing mounted on walls , it is necessary to remind oneself that there is a purpose in this dive  --  the animals must be fed . // " We tried feeding all the sharks from the top , " said Lou Garibaldi , " but only the browns would come up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got hungry enough , they 'd surface feed , too . Instead , when we opened up one morning , quite a number of the fish in the tank were gone . And , of course , if we just dumped food in and let it go at that , there 'd be total chaos . " Now the browns are fed at one time , the turtles at another and the remaining fish immediately after . // My instructions for this " bottom " feeding are that I should go into a cave and remain quiet . That way I will avoid stepping on sharks or aggravating moray eels and loggerhead turtles . " Sometimes the fish go a little nuts , " said Griffin . " There 's no real difference between animals here and in the wild . And there 's no such thing as a tame shark . " // Reaching bottom , I retire to a hole in the reef and stare out at the people staring in through four-inch glass . Those spectators have come to a most singular public place . Financed by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aquarium opened with much fanfare in June 1969 , some 15 years after the old city aquarium folded . // It marked a high point in " New England determination , " stated the Boston Globe , for " not one cent of the more than $5 million construction costs was contributed by any level of government . " Not only was private finance a new twist , so was the aquarium goal . " We do n't want a circus , " said President David B. Stone firmly at the opening . // For a while , though , he had a black comedy . " Everything that could go wrong , did , " Jack Cunningham , the assistant to the president , explained . " Bolts eroded , pipes blew , eels got lost in drains . We had a fire . We had floods . We even had the current going the wrong way in the big tank ; as people walked up the spiral ramp , all they saw were the fishes ' rear ends . " // Finally , with matters under control , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to get people here for recreation , " said Cunningham , " and while they 're here , we try to educate them . " // Toward that end the aquarium has no walk-through whales or dueling dolphins . What it does have besides 75 smaller fresh-and saltwater exhibits ( one of which includes live " touchable " sea creatures ) is the main tank filled with large fish and turtles . But why , one feels compelled to ask , are there so many sharks ? " Because that 's what appeals to people , " said Cunningham . // Jaws , he admitted , had created " unbelievable " interest in that " area , " and the aquarium , for all its sincerity , is not above capitalizing on that . In the gift shop one of the hottest items is a " Killer Shark " jigsaw puzzle showing a shark 's mouth lunging through bloody froth . Diver Griffin , on the other hand , is " sick of the whole Jaws thing . Because of that movie , " he said , " people are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as many sharks as they can . Big deal . Sharks are easy to kill . It would n't be hard to kill off an entire reef in a short time . But like any other fish , sharks are ecologically necessary to the sea . Personally , I think they 're cool . " // On the other side of the glass the crowd is becoming agitated . One of the 25 or so sharks in the tank has approached Griffin , and with a sudden upward surge has sucked in a proffered baby squid like a Hoover picking up a cotton puff . " Nurse sharks can create enough vacuum to rip hermit crabs out of shells , " Lou Garibaldi had said . Suddenly the sharks have arrived from everywhere . They lunge and swirl , turning sideways and rubbing at Griffin 's food bucket like cats against chair legs . They dive and plunge and lie at his feet , their gill slits opening and closing like Venetian blinds . // I back into my grotto . Turtles which have already been fed paddle down , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever hungry , eating even the debris tossed into the tank by spectators . " Sometimes , when a turtle passes waste , so many coins come out it 's like watching a jackpot in Las Vegas , " Griffin said . But now I have worries of my own . A six-foot sand-tiger shark is swimming my way , eyeing me without expression , its silver-gray skin glistening in the dull light like the shark-skin suits on the racks at Robert Hall . Like most humans , I have always ranked sharks alongside piranhas , rattlesnakes , grizzly bears and black-widow spiders , but I now find an odd detachment mingling with my horror . For instance , I never realized a shark 's mouth could be seen as a frown or a smile , depending on the angle from which it is viewed . // Abruptly , the shark dips and whams into my leg , nosing me . I stand rigid as a pipe . The shark wags its tail , slowly passing between my legs . Unaccountably , I reach down and touch its skin , hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is by no means a safe job . Senior diver George Nally once had his side laid open by a tank shark . Bob Griffin received " maybe 35 bites " last year , and several small teeth are still embedded in his hands . But it was on his very first feeding as an employee that Griffin had his closest call . // " My parents were out there watching , " he said . " I really did n't know what to expect , so I was just holding a mackerel in my hand and then this shark started circling me . He charged and grabbed me by the weight belt , and shook me all around the tank . " // The sharp-beaked and hungry turtles can be hazardous , as can the moray eels , which occasionally slither out of their giant clamshells and ooze about like green crepe paper . " When two of them fight over territory , it 's like something from a Japanese monster movie , " Griffin said . Even the sluggish jewfish are to be feared . " One simply inhaled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Garibaldi . " Whenever we add new fish we just assume the animals in the tank will take their 20% to 30% off the top . " // As in the sea , a survival system has evolved and is maintained through degrees of fear , hunger satiation and a defined pecking order . Myrtle the turtle " does what she wants , " but everyone else , even the 10-foot nurse shark who once had to be removed on a stretcher after a confrontation with a turtle , watches his step . " When one of the fish has been nailed during the night , the tension is so strong the next morning even I can feel it , " Griffin said . // The divers carry no weapons to protect themselves but take care to keep their charges calm and orderly . They dive punctually , avoid startling movements and try to make sure every animal gets its fair share of the food . // One thing they do n't do anymore is serve herring . " That 's when the sharks go berserk , " Griffin said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hanging onto my wet suit and clinging to my hair . " // The point here is that sharks , and other dangerous sea beasts , can be approached with a modicum of safety if one has a good understanding of their motivations and behavioral tendencies . " Cousteau said the only predictable thing about sharks is that they will act unpredictably , " Lou Garibaldi noted . " But they have their reasons like any other animal . We just may not know all of the reasons . " // For aquarium divers such as Bob Griffin and Toni Pollack the understanding of tank inhabitants reaches a more personal level . Just by observation they can tell if certain fish are feeling chipper or not , whether they are hungry or diseased or sexually aroused . The sharks are the toughest to read . // " We give names to some of the animals with outstanding personalities , " Griffin said . " There 's Morris the moray and , of course , my favorite , Myrtle . And in another tank we 've got an electric eel named Zap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &amp; Decker . But the sharks are different . " // Ancient animals that have changed little with the passage of time , sharks react to basic stimuli , if little else . Bob Griffin 's hands are scarred and discolored from punching them on the snouts or batting their emery-board tails to maintain order . To really get a point across , he will drop his regulator and bite them in a handy spot , generally a pectoral fin . He also bites the turtles . " They communicate by biting , " he explained . " And so can I. " // As I watch him hand out his last smelt to a charging sand-tiger shark , I can feel several other sharks bumping into me from the front and behind . I recall for an instant what Lou Garibaldi had said about sharks , a point on which Bob Griffin had basically concurred . " When it gets down to it , " said Lou , " if a shark really wants you , he 's got you . " // As we flipper to the surface , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glass , I take a last look at the beasts below . Sharks are strange , fascinating , awesome animals . If they 'd wanted me , they could have had me . I absolutely could n't bring myself to bite one .
