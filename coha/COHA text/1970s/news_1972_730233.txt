txt The Fire Department yesterday made extra doctors available to cope with the recent sharp upturn in the number of firemen reporting sick after fires . A spokesman for the Fire Department said that in addition to the two doctors always on call who respond to major fires and examine firemen on the scene , an extra two doctors on each shift would be kept on stand-by . The spokesman , Paul M. O'Brien , said , however , that the sick calls had " tapered off " slightly in the 24-hour period that ended at 8 A.M. yesterday . A total of 102 fire fighters reported injuries in the 24-hour period , compared with 124 in the preceding 24-hour period , he said . From S A.M. yesterday to midnight , at least another 70 firemen reported themselves sick or injured after fighting fires . The total included 14 of those called to a two-alarm blaze at 157 Prospect Place in the Park Slope area of Brooklyn and 15 at a two-alarm blaze in a vacant , six-story building at 285 East Third Street on the Lower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ department doctors normally on duty examined the ; 9 firemen on the scene  --  as they usually do %len there are two or more alarms  --  and granted them " recuperative time on duty in their firehouses , " he said . Reports on their ailments have not been filed yet . Mr. O'Brien added . The upturn In sick calls came as the 2,700-member Uniformed Fire Officers Association complained about the city 's refusal to include in the proposed contract specific language on pay differentials with other unions . Frank LeMuscio , a spokesman for the fire officers , was unperturbed by the policy of sending doctors to the scene . He asserted that each ' man should automatically report to a medical officer after a fire . " We 've been ? trying to get men to do that all the time , " // he said . He contended that the high incidence of such things as blood poisoning and carbonmonoxide inhalation should make an examination a required procedure after a fire . " Carbon monoxide is odorless and tasteless , " he said . " There 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The new departmental order dispatching doctors to the scene of fires followed a warning by the Fire Commissioner , Robert 0 . Lowery , of the " serious consequences " of any impairment of fire-fighting forces . He stopped short of describing the situation as a " job action . " The fire officers have been asking the city to agree to continue a ratio of 3 to 3.9 between the pay of firemen and their officers . Firemen were said to be intent on minimizing any participation in the sick-call action for fear of jeopardizing a recently negotiated salary agreement , now before the Federal Pay Board . However , among the 102 reported injuries yesterday , there were 24 officers and 63 firemen authorized to take medical leave ranging from a few hours to several days . Fifteen other officers and firemen were returned to duty . " This does n't mean that the men who were sent back to work were feigning injuries , " a fire official said . " It could be that by the time a doctor arrived , the man had recovered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off the job was the equivalent of incapacitating a dozen fire companies , an official said the " cumulative effect " of the sick action made manpower " tighter than normal  --  we 've had to stretch our resources . " Normally 12 to 20 men are on sick ? call each day throughout the city . Meanwhile , Capt . Raymond W. Gimmler , president of the Uniformed Fire Officers Association , said there had been " absolutely no movement " in contract negotiations since a meeting Thursday with Mayor Lindsay . He said the union planned to file a complaint on Tuesday with the Office of Collective Bargaining , over the city 's handling of the contract . - Captain Gimmler asserted that a break in either the parity of fire lieutenant with police sergeants or in the pay differential between firemen and officers could " set things on fire . " Most of the sick calls were made after fires in Brooklyn . Only 18 of the 102 were made in Manhattan and the Bronx .              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
