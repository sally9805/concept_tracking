" From Casablanca and Algiers to Tehran and Karachi , Islam is reasserting itself as a counterpoint to Western influence , " began a lengthy query cabled earlier this year from TIME 'S editorial offices in New York to 16 bureaus throughout the world . " We want to examine Islam 's resurgence , not simply as another faith but as a political force and potent third ideology competing with Marxism and Western culture in the world today . " <P> Back came reports from more than two dozen correspondents , who visited medinas and mosques , and interviewed sultans and emirs , desert tribesmen and professors of Islamic culture . The result is this week 's Special Report on Islam , a sweeping exploration of one of the world 's great faiths , with side trips through the life of Muhammad , the words of the Koran , and the ancient justice of the Shari'a ( Islam 's code of law ) . <P> This story is the latest chapter in TIME 'S half-century tradition of reducing to comprehensible dimensions subjects that readers might find dauntingly broad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at The American People , and has in recent years included Judaism ( 1972 ) , Capitalism ( 1975 ) and Socialism ( 1978 ) . Islam merited such treatment , says Associate Editor Marguerite Johnson , who wrote the main cover story , because " the Iranian revolution has made it especially important for Westerners to understand the driving energy and devotion Islam commands from so many . " Correspondent Dean Brelis was given a vivid example of that devotion when he visited a Bedouin village in the Sahara for this week 's story . Reports Brelis : " An elderly Bedouin invited me to his home and showed me a bright turquoise-blue wall that was covered with primitive but happy paintings that depicted a ship loaded with people , and then a dark cube surrounded by birds and flowers . The entire frieze conveyed a kind of ecstatic vision . The old man explained , his wrinkled face breaking into a happy smile : ' I made the hajj the pilgrimage to Mecca that every Muslim is encouraged to make at least once in his lifetime . And I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with me . So I drew this , and when I am gone it will be here as part of the village . ' " <P> Senior Editor John Elson , who was in charge of the Special Report , first began to appreciate the pervasiveness of the faith while serving as TIME 'S religion writer from 1962 to 1966 . " Islam has been so frequently misunderstood , " contends Elson , " partly because so many people have tried to apply terms from Christianity and Judaism to it . What we have attempted to do is give a succinct but complete picture of a phenomenon that is not merely a faith , but a way of ordering society . "
