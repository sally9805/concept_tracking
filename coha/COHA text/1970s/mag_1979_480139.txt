few years ago I stood in a historic place . It was not a great battlefield , a house , a square , the site of one famous event ; but the site only of countless small ones ? a neat little eighteenth-century garden , formally divided by gravel walks into parterres , with a small wooden house in one corner , where the garden 's owner had once lived . There is only one other garden to compare with it in human history , and that is the one in the Book of Genesis , which never existed outside words . The one in which I stood is very real , and it lies in the old Swedish university town of Uppsala . Its owner was the great warehouse clerk and indexer of nature , Carl von Linne , better known as Linnaeus , Who between 1730 and 1760 docketed , or attempted to docket , most of animate being . Perhaps nothing is more moving at Uppsala than the actual smallness and ordered simplicity of that garden and the immense consequences that sprung from it in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ external world . It is something more than another famous shrine for lovers of nature , like Selborne or Coate Farm or Walden Pond . In fact , for all its air of gentle peace , it is closer to a nuclear explosion , whose radiations and mutations inside the human brain were incalculable and continue to be so : the place where an intellectual seed landed , and is now grown to a tree that shadows the entire globe . I am a heretic about Linnaeus , and find nothing less strange , or more poetically just , than that he should have gone mad at the end of his life . I do not dispute the value of the tool he gave to natural science ? which was in itself no more than a shrewd extension of the Aristotelian system and which someone else would soon have elaborated , if he had not ? but I have doubts about the lasting change it has effected in ordinary human consciousness . Evolution has turned man into a sharply isolating creature , seeing the world not only anthropocentrically but singly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ selves . Almost all our art before the Impressionists ? or their St. John the Baptist , William Turner ? betrays our love of clearly defined boundaries , unique identities , of the individual thing released from the confusion of background . This power of detaching an object from its surroundings and making us concentrate on it is an implicit criterion in all our judgments on the more realistic side of visual art , and very similar , if not identical , to what we require of optical instruments like microscopes and telescopes ? which is to magnify , to focus sharper , to distinguish better , to single out . A great deal of science is devoted to this same end : to providing specific labels , explaining specific mechanisms and ecologies ? in short , to sorting and tidying what seem in the mass indistinguishable one from the other . Even the simplest knowledge of the names and habits of flowers or trees starts this distinguishing or individuating process , and removes us a step from total reality toward anthropocentrism ; that is , it acts mentally as an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or curtails certain possibilities of seeing , apprehending , and experiencing . And that is the bitter fruit from the tree of Uppsalan knowledge . It also begs considerable questions as to the realities of the boundaries we impose on what we see . In a wood , the actual visual " frontier " of any one tree is usually impossible to distinguish , at least in summer . We feel , or think we feel , nearest to a tree 's " essence " ( or that of its species ) when it chances to stand , like us , in isolation ; but evolution did not intend trees to grow singly . Far more than ourselves they are social creatures , and no more natural as isolated specimens than man is as a marooned sailor or a hermit . Their society in turn creates or supports other societies of plants , insects , birds , mammals , microorganisms , all of which we may choose to isolate and section off , but which remain no less the ideal entity , or whole experience , of the wood ? and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Scientists restrict the word symbiotic to those relationships between species that bring some detectable mutual benefit ; but the true wood , the true place of any kind , is the sum of all its phenomena . They are all in some sense symbiotic , being together in a togetherness of beings . It is only because such a vast sum of interactions and coincidences in time and place is beyond science 's calculation ( a scientist might say beyond useful function , even if calculable ) that we so habitually ignore it , and treat the flight of the bird and the branch it flies from , the leaf in the wind and its shadow on the ground , as separate events , or riddles . What bird ? Which branch ? What leaf ? Which shadow ? These question-boundaries ( where do I file that ? ) are ours , not of reality . We are led to them , caged by them not only culturally and intellectually , but quite physically , by the restlessness of our eyes and their limited field and acuity of vision . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invented , they existed in our eyes and minds , both in our mode of perception and in our mode of analyzing the perceived : endless short sequence and jump-cut , endless need to edit and arrange this raw material . The cost of understanding SPENT ALL my younger life as a more or less orthodox amateur naturalist ; as a pseudoscientist , treating nature as some sort of intellectual puzzle , or game , in which being able to name names and explain behaviorisms ? to identify and to understand machinery ? constituted all the pleasures and the prizes . I became slowly aware of the inadequacy of this approach : that it insidiously cast nature as a kind of opponent , an opposite team to be outwitted and beaten ; that in a number of very important ways it distracted from the total experience and the total meaning of nature ? and not only of what I personally needed from nature , not only as I had long , if largely unconsciously , begun to feel it ( which was neither scientifically nor sentimentally , but in a way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word ) . I came to believe that this approach represented a major human alienation , affecting all of us , both personally and socially ; moreover , that such alienation had much more ancient roots behind the historical accident of its present scientific , or pseudoscientific , form . Naming things is always implicitly categorizing and therefore collecting them , attempting to own them ; and because man is a highly acquisitive creature , brainwashed by most modern societies into believing that the act of acquisition is more enjoyable than the fact of having acquired , that getting beats having got , mere names and the objects they are tied to soon become stale . There is a constant need , or compulsion , to seek new objects and names in the context of nature , new species and experiences . Everyday ones grew mute with familiarity , so known they become unknown ; and not only in nonhuman nature . Only fools think our attitude to our fellow men is a thing distinct from our attitude to " lesser " life on this planet . All this is an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obsessed with both the machine and exact taxonomy . Only the other day I came upon a letter in a forgotten drawer of the little museum of which I am curator . It was from a well-known Victorian fern expert and about some twenty or so specimens he had been sent from Dorset ? all reducible , to a modern botanist , to three species . But this worthy gentleman felt obliged , in a welter of Latin polysyllables , to grant each specimen some new subspecilic or varietal rank , as if they were unbaptized children and might all go to hell if they were not given individual names . It would be absurd to deny the Victorians their enormous achievements in saner scientific fields , and I am not engaging in some sort of Luddite fantasy , wishing the machine they invented had been different , or even not at all . But we are far better at seeing the immediate advantages of such gains in knowledge of the exterior world than at assessing the costs of them . The particular cost of understanding the mechanism of nature , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most of all in the ordinary person 's perception of it , in his ability to live with and care for it and not to see it as enemy , challenge , defiance . Selection from total reality is no less necessary in science than it is in art ; but outside those domains ( in both of which the final test of selection is utility , or yield , to our own species ) it seriously distorts and limits any worthwhile relationship . CAUSED MY HOSTS at Uppsala , where I went to lecture on the novel , some puzzlement by demanding ( the literary business once over ) to see Linnaeus 's garden rather than the treasures of one of the most famous libraries in Europe . The feeling that I was not behaving as a decent writer should was familiar . Again and again in recent years I have told visiting literary- academics that the key to my fiction , for what it is worth , lies in my relationship with nature ? I might almost have said , for reasons I will explain , in trees . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ degrees of politeness , this assertion treated as some sort of irrelevant quirk , eccentricity , devious evasion of what must be the real truth : literary influences and theories of fiction , and all the rest of that purely intellectual midden that faculty hens and cocks so like scratching over . Of course such matters are a part of the truth , but they are no more the whole truth than that the tree we see above ground is the whole tree . Even if we do discuss nature , I soon sense that we are talking about two different things : on their side some abstract intellectual concept , and on mine an experience whose deepest value lies in the fact that it can not be directly described by any art including that of words . One interrogator even accused me of bad faith : that if I sincerely felt so deeply on the matter , I should write more about it . But what I gain most from nature is beyond words . To try to capture it verbally immediately places me in the same boat as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it exiles me from what I most need to learn . It is a little as it is in atomic physics , where the very act of observation changes what is observed ; though here the catch lies in trying to describe the observation . To enter upon such a description is like trying to capture the uncapturable . Its only purpose can he to flatter the vanity of the describer ? a function painfully obvious in many of the more sentimental natural-history writers . But I think the most harmful change brought about by Victorian science in our attitude toward nature lies in the demand that our relation with it must be purposive , industrious , always seeking greater . knowledge . This dreadfully serious and puritanical approach ( nowhere better exhibited in the nineteenth century than in the countless penny magazines aimed at young people ) has had two very harmful effects . One is that it turned the vast majority of contemporary Western mankind away from what had become altogether too much like a duty , or a school lesson ; the second is that the far saner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ philosophers , as an evoker of emotion , as a pleasure , a poem , was forgotten . There are in-tellectual reasons as well for this . Darwin made sentimental innocence , nature as mainly personal or aesthetic experience , vaguely wicked . Not only did he propose a mechanism seemingly as iron as the steam engine , but his very method of discovery , and its success in solving a great conundrum , offered an equally iron or one-sided model for the amateur naturalist himself , and made the older and more humanist approach seem childish . A " good " amateur naturalist today merely means one whose work is valued by the professional scientists in his field . An additional element of alienation has come- with motion pictures and television , which are selective in another way . They present natural reality not only through other eyes , but in a version of it in which the novelty or rarity of the subject plays a preponderant part in choice and treatment . Of course the nature film or program has an entertainment value ; of course there are some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people 's images and opinions of actual things and events ; but , as with the Linnaean system , there is a cost . Being taken by camera into the deepest African jungle , across the Arctic wastes , thirty fathoms deep in the sea , may seem a " miracle of modern technology " ; but it will no more bring the viewer nearer the reality of nature , or to a proper human relationship with the actual nature around him , than merely reading novels is likely to teach the writing of them . The most one can say is that it may help ; a much more common result is to be persuaded of the futility of even trying . Increasingly , we live ( and not only in terms of nature and novels ) by the old tag , Ara Caesar , aut nuilus ? " If I ca n't be Caesar , be no one . " If I ca n't have the knowledge of a scientist , I 'll know nothing . If I ca n't have superb close-ups and rare creatures in the nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ representation of nature is better , to those remote from it in their daily lives , than none . Yet a great deal of such representation seems to me to descend straight from the concept of the menagerie , another sadly alienating selection , or reduction , from reality . Poking umbrellas through iron bars did not cease with the transition from the zoo to the screen . The myth of the green man UCH OF seventeenth- and eighteenth-century science and erudition is obsolete nonsense in modern scientific terms : in its personal interpolations , its diffuse reasoning , its misinterpreted evidence , its frequent blend of the humanities with science proper ? its quotations from Horace and Virgil in the middle of a treatise on forestry . But one general , if unconscious , assumption lying behind almost all pre-Victorian science ? that it is being presented by an entire human being , with all his complexities , to an audience of other entire human beings ? has been much too soon dismissed as a mere historical phenomenon , at best exhibiting an engaging amateurishness , at worst sheer stupidity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is not , of course , the fault of modern scientists that most of their formal discourse is now of so abstruse a nature that only their fellow specialists can hope to understand it , that the discourse itself is increasingly mechanical , with words reduced to cogs and treated as poor substitutes for some more purely scientific formulation ; nor is it directly their fault that their vision of empirical knowledge , the all-important value they put on proved or demonstrable fact , has seeped down to dominate the popular view of nature ? and our education about it . Our fallacy lies in supposing that the limiting nature of scientific method corresponds to the nature of ordinary experience . Ordinary experience , from waking second to second , is in fact highly synthetic ( in the sense of combinative or constructive ) , and made of a complexity of strands , past memories and present perceptions , times and places , private and public history , hopelessly beyond science 's powers to analyze . It is quintessentially " wild , " one might say unphilosophical , irrational @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very closely ? despite our endless efforts to " garden , " to invent disciplining social and intellectual systems ? to wild nature . Almost all the richness of our personal existence derives from this synthetic and eternail ) , present " confused " consciousness of both internal and external reality , and not least because we know it is beyond the analytical , or destructive , capacity of science . Half by its principles , half by its inventions , science now largely dictates and forms our common , or public , perception of and attitudes toward external reality . One can speak of an attitude that is generally held by society ; but society itself is an abstraction , a Linnaeus-like label we apply to a group of individuals seen in a certain context and for a certain purpose ; and before the attitude can be generally held , it must pass through the filter of the individual consciousness , where this irreducible " wild " component lies ? the one that may agree with science and society but can never be wholly plumbed or commanded by them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and folklore has accreted around the idea of the man in the trees . In all his manifestations , as dryad , as stag-headed Herne , as outlaw , he possesses the characteristic of elusiveness , a power of " melting " into the trees , and I am certain the attraction of the myth is so profound and universal because it is constantly " played " inside every consciousness . This notion of the green man ? or green woman , as novelist and naturalist W. H. Hudson made her ? seen as emblem of the close connection between the actuality of present consciousness ( not least in its habitual flight into a mental greenwood ) and what seems to me lost by science in man 's attitude toward nature ? that is , the " wild " side of his own , his inner feeling as opposed to the outer , fact-bound , conforming face imposed by fashion ? helped me question my old pseudoscientist self . But it also misled me for a time . In the 1950s I grew interested in the Zen theories of " seeing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ names at things-in-themselves . I stopped bothering to identify species new to me ; I concentrated more and more on the familiar , daily nature around me , where I then lived . But living without names is impossible , if not downright idiocy , in a writer ; and living without explanation or speculation as to causality , little better ? for Western man , at least . I discovered , too , that there was less conflict than I had imagined between nature as external assembly of names and facts and nature as internal feeling ; that the two modes of seeing or knowing could in fact marry and take place almost simultaneously , and enrich each other . Nature 's uhrahumanity GRIEVING A RELATIONSHIP with nature is both a science and an art , beyond mere knowledge or mere feeling alone ; and , I now think , beyond Oriental mysticism , transcendentalism , " meditation techniques , " and the rest ? or at least as we in the West have converted them to our use , which seems increasingly in a narcissistic way : to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I do not believe nature is to be reached that way either , by turning it into a therapy , a free clinic for admirers of their own sensitivity . The subtlest of our alienations from it , the most difficult to comprehend , is our eternal need to use it in some way , to derive some personal yield . We shall'never fully understand nature I or ourselves ) , and certainly never respect it , until we dissociate the wild from the notion of usability ? however innocent and harmless the use . For it is the general uselessness of so much of nature that lies at the root of our ancient hostility and indifference to it . There is a kind of coldness ? I would rather say a stillness , an empty space ? at the heart of our forced coexistence with all the other species of the planet . The naturalist Richard Jefferies coined a word for it : the ultralumnanity of all this is not man ... not with us or against us , but outside and beyond us , truly alien . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he alienated ? by our knowledge , by our greed , by our vanity ? from nature until we grant it its unconscious alienation from us . I am not one of those supreme optimists who think all the world 's ills , and especially this growing rift between man and nature , can be cured by a return to a quasi-agricultural , ecologically " caring " society . It is not that I doubt it might theoretically be so cured ; but the possibility of the return defeats my powers of imagination . The majority of Western man are now urban , and the whole world will soon follow suit . A significant tilt of balance in human history is expected by the end of the coming decade : more than half of all mankind will by then have moved inside towns and cities . Any hope of reversing that trend , short of some universal catastrophe , is as tiny and precarious as the monarch butterflies I watched , an autumn or two ago , migrating among the Fifth Avenue skyscrapers in central Manhattan . All chance of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ education , be it in the simplest way of all , by having it near at hand , recedes from the many , who already effectively live in a support system in outer space , a creation of science , and without means to escape it , culturally or economically . But the problem is not , or only minimally , that nature itself is in imminent danger or that we shall lose touch with it simply because we have less access to it . A number of species , environments , unusual ecologies are in danger . There are major pollution problems . But even in our most densely populated countries the ordinary wild remains far from the brink of extinction . We may not exaggerate the future threats and dangers , but we do exaggerate the present and actual state of this global nation ? underestimate the degree to which it is still surviving and accessible to those who want to experience it . It is far less nature itself that is yet in true danger than our attitude toward it . Already we behave as if we live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there actually is ? in a world that may come , but remains a black hypothesis , not a present reality . BELIEVE the major cause of this more mental than physical rift lies less in the folly or one-sidedness of our societies and educational systems , or in the historical evolution of man into a predominantly urban and industrial creature , a thinking termite , than in the way we have , during these past 150 years , devalued the kind of experience or knowledge we loosely define as art , and especially in the way we have failed to grasp its deepest difference from science . No art is truly teachable in its essence . All the knowledge in the world of its techniques can provide in itself no more than imitations or replicas of previous art . What is irreplaceable in any object of art is never , in the final analysis , its technique or craft , but the personality of the artist , the expression of his or her unique and individual feeling All major advances in technique have come about to serve this need . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , to learnability . Once Joyce has written , Picasso painted , Webern composed , it requires only a minimal gift , besides patience and practice , to copy their techniques exactly . Yet we all know why this kind of technique-copy , even when it is so painstakingly done ? for instance , in painting ? that it deceives museum and auction-house experts , is counted worthless beside the work of the original artist . It is not of him or her ; it is not art , but imitation . As it is with the true " making " arts , so it is with the other aspects of human life of which we say that full knowledge or experience also requires an art ? some inwardly creative or purely personal factor beyond the power of external teaching to instill or science to predict . Attempts to impart recipes or set formulas as to practice and enjoyment are always two-edged , since the question is not so much whether they may or may not enrich the normal experience of that abstract thing , the normal man or woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ damage that other essential component of the process , the contribution of the artist in this sense ? the individual experiencer , the " green man " hidden in the leaves of his unique and once-only being . Telling people why , how , and when they ought to feel this or that ? whether it be with regard to the enjoyment of nature , of food , of sex , or anything else ? may , undoubtedly sometimes does , have a useful function in dispelling various kinds of socially harmful ignorance . But what this instruction can not give is the deepest benefit of any art , be it of making or of knowing or of experiencing : which is self-expression and self-discovery . The last thing a sex manual can be is an Ars amorisa science of coupling , perhaps , but never an art of love . Exactly the same is true of so many nature manuals . They may teach you how and what to look for , what to question in external nature , but never in your own nature . In science greater knowledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means so throughout all human existence . We know it from art proper , where achievement and great factual knowledge , or taste , or intelligence , are in no way essential companions ; if they were , our best artists would also be our most learned academics . We can know it by reducing the matter to the absurd , and imagining that God , or some protean visitor from outer space , were at one fell swoop to grant us all of knowable knowledge . Such omniscience would be worse than the worst natural catastrophe for our species as a whole ; it would extinguish its soul , lose it all pleasure and reason for living . This is not the only area in which , like the rogue computer of science fiction , some socially or culturally consecrated proposition ? which may be true or good in its social or cultural context ? extends itself to the individual ; but it is one of the most devitalizing . Most mature artists know that great general knowledge is more a hindrance than a help . It is only innately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ research : in nine cases out of ten what natural knowledge and imagination can not supply is in any case precisely what needs to be left out . The green man in all of us is well aware of this . In practice we spend far more time rejecting knowledge than trying to gain it , and wisely so . But it is in the nature of all society , let alone one deeply imbued with a scientific and technological ethos , to bombard us with ever more knowledge ? and to consider any questioning or rejection of it unpatriotic and immoral . Art and nature are siblings , branches of the one tree , and nowhere more than in the continuing inexplicability of many of their processes ? and above all those of creation and of effect on their respective audiences . Our approach to art , as to nature , has become increasingly scientized ( and dreadfully serious ) during this past century . It sometimes seems now as if it is principally there not for itself but to provide material for labeling , classifying , analyzing ? specimens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moths and butterflies . This is , of course , especially true of ? and pernicious in ? our schools and universities . I think the first sign that I might one day become a novelist ( though 55 I did not then realize it ) was the passionate detestation I developed at my own school for all those editions of examination books that began with a long introduction : an anatomy lesson that always reduced the original text to a corpse by the time one got to it , a lifeless demonstration of a preestablished proposition . It took me years to realize that even geniuses , the Shakespeares , the Racines , the Austens , have human faults . of art gives for professional explainers to show their skills , has become almost an aesthetic virtue ; at another extreme , the notion of art as vocation ( that is , something to which one is genetically suited ) is dismissed as nonscientific and inegalitarian . It is not a gift beyond personal choice , but one that can be acquired , like knowledge of science , by rote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so patterned and persuaded by the tone of the more serious reviewing of art in our magazines and newspapers that we no longer notice their overwhelmingly scientific tone , or the paradox of this knowing-naming technique being applied to a nonscientific object ? one whose production the artist himself can not fully explain , and one whose effect the vast majority of the nonreviewing audience do not attempt to explain . The professional critic or academic would no doubt say this is mere ignorance , that both artists and audiences have been taught to understand themselves and the object that links them , to make the relationship articulate and fully conscious defoliate the wicked green man , hunt him out of his trees . Of course there is a place for the scientific , or quasi-scientific , analysis of art , as there is ( and far greater ) for that of nature . But the danger , in both art and nature , is that all emphasis is placed on the created , not the creation . All artifacts , all bits of scientific knowledge , have one thing in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the past , they are relics of something already observed , deduced , formulated , created , and as such qualify to go through the Linnaean , and every other , scientific mill . Yet we can not say that the " green " or creating process does not happen or has no importance just because it is largely private and beyond lucid description and rational analysis . We might as well argue that the young wheat-plant is irrelevant because it can yield nothing to the miller and his stones . We know that in any sane reality the green blade is as much the ripe grain as the child is father to the man . Nor of course does the simile apply to art alone , since we are all in a way creating our future out of our present , our " published " outward behavior out of our inner green being . One main reason we may seldom feel this happening is that society does not want us to . Such random personal creativity is offensive to all machines . BEGAN this wander through the trees ? we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in search of that much looser use of the word art to describe a way of knowing and experiencing and enjoying outside the major modes of science and art proper , a way not concerned with scientific discovery and artifacts , a way that is internally rather than externally creative , that leaves very little public trace , and yet that , for those very reasons , is almost wholly concentrated in its own creative process . It is really only the qualified scientist or artist who can escape from the interiority and constant now-ness , the green chaos of this experience , by making some aspect of it exterior and so fixing it in past time , or known knowledge . Thereby they create new , essentially parasitical , orders and categories of phenomena that in turn require both a science and an art of experiencing . But nature is unlike art in terms of its product ? what we in general . know it by . The difference is that it is not only created , an external object with a history , and so belonging to a past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience it . As we watch , it is , so to speak , rewriting , reformulating , repainting , rephotographing itself . It refuses to stay fixed and fossilized in the past , as both the scientist and the artist feel it somehow ought to ; and both will generally try to impose this fossilization on it . Verb tenses can be very misleading here : we stick adamantly in speech to the strict protocol of actual time . Of and in the present we speak in the present , of the past in the past . But our psychological tenses can be very different . Perhaps because I am a writer ( and nothing is more fictitious than the past in which the first , intensely alive and present , draft of a novel goes down on the page ) , I long ago noticed this in my naturalist self : that is , a disproportionately backward element in any present experience of nature , a retreat or running-back to past knowledge and experience , whether it was the definite past of personal memory or the indefinite , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scientific behavior . This seemed to me often to cast a mysterious veil of deadness , of having already happened , over the actual and present event or phenomenon . I had a vivid example of it only a few years ago in France , long after I thought I had grown wise to this self-imposed brainwashing. came on my first Military orchid , a species I had long wanted to encounter but hitherto had never seen outside a book . I fell on my knees before it in a way that all botanists will know . I identified , to be quite certain , with Professors Clapham , Tutin , and Warburg in hand ( the standard British Flora ) , I measured , I photographed , I worked out where I was on the map , for future reference . I was excited , very happy , one always remembers one 's " firsts " of the rarer species . Yet five minutes after my wife had finally ( other women are not the only form of adultery ) torn me away , I suffered a strange feeling . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the little colony we had found . Despite all the identifying , measuring , photographing , I had managed to set the experience in a kind of present past , a having-looked , even as I was temporarily and physically still looking . If I had had the courage , and my wife the patience , I would have asked her to turn and drive back , because I knew I had just fallen , in the stupidest possible way , into an ancient trap . It is not necessarily too little knowledge that causes ignorance ; possessing too much , or wanting to gain too much , can produce the same result . There is something in the nature of nature , in its presentness , its seeming transience , its creative ferment and hidden potential , that corresponds very closely with the wild , or green-man , part of our own psyches ; and it is a something that disappears as soon as it is relegated to an automatic pastness , a status of merely classifiable thing , image taken then . " Thing " and " then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was then ; if it was then , it is thing . We lack trust in the present , this moment , this actual seeing , because our culture tells us to trust only the reported back , the publicly framed , the edited , the thing set in the clearly artistic or the clearly scientific angle of perspective . One of the deepest lessons we have to learn is that nature , of its nature , resists this . It waits to be seen otherwise , in its individual presentness and from our individual presentness . I come now near the heart of what seems to me to be the single greatest danger in the rich legacy left us by Linnaeus and the other founding fathers of all our sciences and scientific mores and methods ? or more fairly , left us by our leaping evolutionary ingenuity in the invention of tools . All tools , from the simplest word to the most advanced space probe , are disturbers and rearrangers of primordial nature and reality ? are , in the dictionary definition , " mechanical implements for working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I suspect in direct proportion to our ever-increasing dependence on them , is to addict us to purpose , both to looking for purpose in everything external to us and to looking internally for purpose in everything we do ? to seek explanation of the outside world by purpose , to justify our seeking by purpose . This addiction to finding a reason , a function , a quantifiable yield , has now infiltrated all aspects of our lives ? and become effectively synonymous with pleasure . The modern version of hell is purposelessness . Nature suffers particularly in this , and our indifference and hostility to it is closely connected with the fact that its only purpose appears to be being and surviving . We may think that this comprehends all animate existence , including our own , and so it must , finally ; but we have long ceased to be content with so abstract a motive . A scientist would rightly say that all form and behavior in nature is highly purposive , or strictly designed for the end of survival ? specific or genetic , according to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the nonscientist , indecipherable ; and the immense variety of nature appears to hide nothing , nothing but a green chaos at the core ? which we brilliantly purposive apes can use and exploit as we please , with a free conscience . A green chaos . Or a wood . An otter dream N SOME MYSTERIOUS WAY woods have never seemed to me to be static things . In physical terms , I move through them ; yet in metaphysical ones , they seem to move through me. just as , if I watch a film , I stay physically in one place and it is the images in the projector that shift , as do the words on the page and the scenes they evoke , when read . This inner or mental reversal of the actual movement , common to all traveling , comes close to what I like most in all narrative art , from the novel to the cinema : that is , the motion from a seen present to a hidden future . The reason that woods provide this experience so naturally and intensely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of any large congregation of trees ; in the degree to which they hide what exists , at any given point , beyond the immediately visible surroundings . In this they are like series of rooms and galleries , houselike , doored , and screened , continuous yet separate ; or paged and chaptered , like a fiction . Just as with fiction , there are in this sense good and bad tree congregations ? some that tempt the visitor to turn the page , to explore further , others that do not . But even the most " unreadable " woods and forests are in fact subtler than any conceivable fiction , which can never represent the actual multiplicity of choice of paths in a wood , but only one particular path through it . Yet that multiplicity of choice , though it can not be conveyed in the frozen medium of the printed text , is very characteristic of the actual writing , of the constant dilemma ? pain or pleasure , according to circumstances ? its actual practice represents , from the formation of the basic sentence to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ending . Behind every path and every form of expression one does finally choose lie the ghosts of all those that one did not . I do not plan my fiction any more than I normally plan woodland walks ; I follow the path that seems most promising at any given point , not sonic itinerary decided before entry . I am quite sure this is not some kind of rationalization , or irrationalization , after the fact ; that having discovered I write fiction in a disgracefully haphazard sort of way , I now hit on the passage through an unknown wood as an analogy . It was the peculiar nature of my adolescent explorings of England 's Devon countryside ( peculiar because I had not been brought up in a rural atmosphere , could not take the countryside for granted ; indeed it came to me with something of the unreality , the not-quitethereness of a fiction ) that made me what I am ? and in many other ways besides writing . I see now that what I liked best about the green density , the unpeopled secrecy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , was its explorability . I thought at the time that I was learning to shoot and fish ( also to trespass and poach , I am afraid I , to botanize and bird-watch ; but I was really addicting myself , and beyond curability , to the pleasures of discovery , and in particular of isolated discovery and experience . The lonelier the place , the better it pleased me : its silence , its aura , its peculiar conformation , its enclosedness . I had a dream of some endless combe , I suppose almost an animal dream , an otter dream , of endless hanging beechwoods and hazel coppices and leated meadows , houseless and manless . It was not quite without substance in those days ; such " lost " valleys still existed , and in some of them the rest of the world did not . But of course they were finite , and at some point ended at a Jane , a cottage or farmhouse , " civilization " ; and discovery died . The cost of all this is that I have never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solitary discovery ? in terms of true geographical exploration , for the proper exploitation of the discovery . I have dabbled in many branches of natural and human ) hisger , eroticism , search ) first discovered by those early medieval writers . We have simply transferred the tree setting to the now more familiar brick-and-concrete forest of town and city . I must confess that certain juxtapositions of tree and building , especially in city hearts , and perhaps most strikingly of all in New York City , have always rather touched me : the sight of those literal and symbolic leaf-walls standing side by side , half-hiding , half-revealing , can be strangely poetic , and not just in architectural terms . Older and less-planned quarters of cities and towns are profoundly woodlike , and especially in this matter of the mode of their passage through us , the way they unreel , disorient , open , close , surprise , please . The stupidest mistake of all the many stupid mistakes of twentieth-century architects has been to forget this ancient model in their more grandiose town-planning . Geometric @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cities make human beings . A vast and hostile desert HAT LAST ASSERTION would have seemed very near heresy to the medieval mind , and politically dangerous to those of the Renaissance and seventeenth-century Europe . The attraction of the forest setting to the . early pioneers of fiction was in no way an attraction to the forest itself . It was clearly evil ; but being evil it gave convenient excuse for the legitimate portrayal of all its real or supposed dangers to the traveler . The church might complain about the eagerness with which the educated public throughout Europe took to these tree-tales of adultery , magic , mystery , monsters , eternal danger , and eternal temptation ; but it could hardly deny the general truth of a proposition it was itself increasingly determined to maintain : the inherent wickedness of godless nature , in outer reality as in man himself . Raymond Chandler and the other creators of our own century 's private eyes have used exactly the same technique , substituting evil city for evil trees and then giving themselves a comprehensive license , behind the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vices , horrors , and seductions from the straight path whose gauntlet he has to run in order to earn the adjective . Sir Galahad and Philip Marlowe are blood brothers . During nearly all of the past thousand years true human virtue ( and virtuous beauty has lain for European mankind in nature tamed , on its knees inside the hortus conclusus , or emblematic walled garden of civilization . So powerful was this concept that naturalistic artistic representation of wild landscape is entirely absent before the seventeenth century , and so rare then that one might almost say before the advent of the Romantic movement ; while public concern for nature , positive steps to protect it , did not come until well into the nineteenth century , and even then only intermittently . Our own , the last of the millennium , is in fact the first to show some sort of general and international concern ; and I do not think we should be too self-congratulatory about that . The future may well judge that we had both the scientific awareness and the political organization , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Nor is it simply that in the medieval beginnings of our suspicious attitude toward nature so many artists employed the literal imagery of the Garden of Eden , of Paradise , of Virgin and docile unicorn in a bower . Even when wilderness and chaos ? the two were virtually synonymous ? had to be shown in such things as the backgrounds of hermit and hell pictures , they were as formally arranged , as parklike , as the closed garden itself : exactly as if the physical limits of the painting were metaphorical garden walls , and nothing inside could be presented as it really existed , behaved , and grew . Of course this high formality now seems to us one of the great charms of medieval art ; and one can not blame the earlier medieval artists for failing to put down what they in any case lacked the techniques to represent , even if they had possessed the wish and the clear vision . But those techniques came , and it seems to me that nothing is more revealing than the inability of such artists as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? for all their honesty in other things , such as human portraiture , to look nature entire in the face . Clearly two such sharp observers and superb draftsmen could technically have conveyed it ; yet some deep mental blindness , or complex , prevented them . Diirer 's tuft of violets or his hare , Pisanello 's lizards , stags , his hoopoe , and his cheetah ( surely the most beautiful single drawing ever done of that animal ) may seem to us as " natural , " as realistic , as a modern photograph . But in terms of art history they must also seem surreptitious , bearing a faint stigma of the pornographic , of a secret wickedness the more public artist had to deny ; for as soon as such individual elements become no more than components in a wider scene , they must be gardened , artificially posed and arranged , turned into mere emblems . We all have our favorite pictures , or icons , and one of mine has long been a painting by Pisanello in the National Gallery in London , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his horse in a forested wilderness ? he is out hunting ? arrested before his vision of a stag bearing Christ crucified between its antlers . Other animals , birds , and flowers crowd the background of the small picture . The artifice of the ensemble , above all when compared with Pisanello 's own survived work-sketches of individual beast and bird in it , is almost total . The sketches and drawings are entirely and dazzlingly naturalistic ; yet in the painting their subjects become as heraldic and symbolic , as unreally juxtaposed , as beasts in a tapestry . I know no picture that demonstrates more convincingly , and touchingly , this strange cultural blindness ; and it is fitting that Pisanello should have chosen the patron saint of dogs ( and formerly of hunting , before St. Hubert usurped that role ) as the central figure , and distorter , of the nonhuman life around him . What is truly being hounded , harried , and crucified in this ambiguous little masterpiece is not Christ , but nature itself . Even the great seventeenth-century landscapists , such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if one compares their portrayal of it with that of contemporary towns and other human artifacts ; it was still mere background to be composed and gardened in accordance with their own notion of the picturesque ? far less treescapes , in a painter like Hobbema , than townscapes composed with trees instead of houses . Nature by then was not so much to be feared and anathematized asslighted and mistrusted ? to be improved , made tasteful . In many ways painters did not begin to see nature whole until the camera saw it for them ? and already , in this context , had begun to supersede them . RT HAS NO special obligation to be realistic and naturalistic , indeed any obligation at all except to say what the artist wants or chooses to say . Yet this long-lasting inability to convey the whole as truthfully as the isolated part ? this failure to match the human eye ( or the camera ) in the ensemble , despite having equaled it in the detail at least four centuries ( Pisanello died in 1455 ) before the camera @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubt in man . There are very understandable practical reasons why , well into the sixteenth century , European man ( at home as well as on his voyages of exploration ) should regard untamed nature much as he regarded the sea ? as a vast and essentially hostile desert , a kind of necessary evil . Commerce , personal profit , government , social stability , and many other things required that the then largely arboreal wasteland between towns and cities should be crossed ; but there was no pleasure in it , beyond safe arrival at the other end ? except perhaps that of hunting , but even that was the sport of a few , and done armed , in safe parties . As in so much else , the Robin Hood myth , or that part of it that suggests life under the greenwood tree can be pleasant , runs profound . ly counter to the general feeling and spirit of the Middle Ages ; and even in the Robin Hood corpus , the happy greenwood side is much more an element of the Elizabethan and later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is probably no coincidence that the end of the first great wave of common-land enclosure and . the rise of the Puritan ethos both took place in Elizabethan times . The first hints of a rebellious and irreligious swing from nature-fearing to nature-liking took place then . The pastoral settings and themes of some of Shakespeare 's plays ? the depiction of not totally unrewarding exiles from the safe garden of civilization in A Midsummer Night 's Dream , As You Like It , The Tempest , and others ? are not examples of the foresight of genius , but skillful pandering to a growing vogue . Yet little of this is reflected in actual seventeenth-century ways of life ? and least of all in their gardens , which remained in general quite as formal as medieval ones . Nature still remained a potential dissolver of decency , a notion the endless chain of new discoveries about the ways of more primitive man ? the nearer nature , the nearer Caliban ? did nothing to dispel . It remained essentially an immense green cloak for Satan : for the commission of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order , above all for impious doubters of man himself , as God 's chosen steward and bailiff over the rest of creation . We may think , now that the steward has so comprehensively reversed the old ratio of nature to civilization , that such superstitious hatreds and fears of the wild are dead ? and especially their indispensable corollary , the idea of all virtue and beauty lying inside the confines of the hortus amclusus . But I see little sign of it , and certainly not in the way ordinary householders in Europe and America still run their own gardens , or in the considerable industry that supplies their needs in terms of pesticides and herbicides . The one place -- -and ominously close to us , both physically and psychologically ? in which wild nature remains unwelcome and detested is the private garden ; and this despite its growing popularity in terms of books and television screen , and all the endeavors of the conservationists . I remember a strange event , in that suburban road in Essex where I was born . One of the elderly residents went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drew his curtains and turned his back on the outside world . There was at first considerable sympathy for the poor man , until it was realized that the outside world included his own garden . No grass was cut , no beds weeded , no trees pruned ; the place ran riot with dandelion , ragwort , nettles , fireweed , heaven knows what else . Such a flagrant invitation to the abominable fifth column deeply shocked my father and his neighbors ; and all their sympathy promptly shifted tothis Quisling 's immediate neighbors , now under constant paratroop invasion from the seeded composites and willow-herbs . I passed this derelict horror one cold winter day and to my joy saw one of Britain 's rarest and most beautiful birds , a waxwing , happily feeding on a massive crop of berries on a tree there . But that was only a tiny poetic revenge . Retreating into outer space OST OF US remain firmly , medieval , self-distancing , and distanced from what we can neither own nor fully control , and from what we can not see or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has decreed that anything that visits us from outer space must ( in defiance of all probability ) come with evil intent , so do we still assess most of nature , or at least where it comes close to us . Some deep refusal to accept the implications of Voltaire 's famous sarcasm about the wickedness of animals in defending themselves when attacked still haunts the common unconscious : what is not clearly for mankind must be against it . We can not swallow the sheer indifference , the ultrahumanity , of so much of nature . We may deplore the deforestation of the Amazon basin , the pollution of our seas and rivers , the extermination of the whale family , and countless other crimes committed against the wild by contemporary man . But like nature itself , most of these things take place outside our direct knowledge and experience , and we seem incapable of supposing that responsibility for them ( or lack of responsibility ) might begin much closer to home , and in our own species ' frightened past quite as much as in its helpless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with fear . I do not know how else one accounts for the popularity of such recent and loathsome manifestations of a purely medieval mentality as the film Jaws ? and all its unhappy spawn . The threat to us in the coming millennium lies not in nature seen as rogue shark but in our growing emotional and intellectual detachment from it ? and I do not think the remedy lies solely in the success or failure of the conservation movement . It lies as much in our being able to admit the debit side of scientific revolution , and especially the chang6 it has effected in our modes of perceiving and of experiencing the world as individuals . Science is centrally , almost metaphysically , obsessed by general truths , by classifications that stop at the species , by functional laws whose worth is valued by their universality ; by statistics , where a Bach or a da Vinci is no more than a quotum , a hole in a computer tape . The scientist has even to generalize himself , to subtract all personal feeling from the conduct of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He may study individuals , but only to help establish more widely applicable laws and facts . Science has little time for minor exceptions . But all nature , like all humanity , is made of minor exceptions , of entities that in some way , however scientifically disregardable , do not conform to the general rule . A belief in this kind of exception is as central to art as a belief in the utility of generalization is to science ; indeed one might almost call art that branch of science that present science is prevented , by its own constricting tenets and philosophies ( that old hortus conciusus again ) , from reaching . I see little hope of any recognition of this until we accept three things about nature . One is that knowing it fully is an art as well as a science . The second is that the heart of this art lies in our own personal nature and its relationship to other nature ? never in nature as a collection of " things " outside us . The last is that this kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other means ? by painting , by photography , by words , by science itself . They may encourage , foster , and help induce the art of the relationship ; but they can not reproduce it , any more than a painting can reproduce a symphony , or the reverse . In the end they can serve only as an inferior substitute , especially if we use them as some people use sexual relationships , merely to flatter and justify ourselves . There is a deeper wickedness still in Voltaire 's unregenerate animal . It wo n't be owned , or more precisely , it will not be disanimated , unsouled , by the manner in which we try to own it . When it is owned , it disappears . Perhaps nowhere is our human mania for possess.ing , our delusion that what is owned can not have a soul of its own , more harmful to us . This disanimation justified all the horrors of the African slave trade . If the black man is so stupid that he can be enslaved , he can not have the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ animal . We have yet to cross the threshold of emancipating mere animals ; but we should not forget what began the emancipation of the slaves in Britain and America . It was not science or scientific reason , but religious conscience and fellow-feeling . Unlike white sharks , trees do not even possess the ability to defend themselves when attacked ; what arms they sometimes have , like thorns , are static ; and their size and immobility means they can not hide . They are the most defenseless of creation in regard to man , universally placed by him below the level of animate feeling , and so the most prone to destruction . Their main evolutionary defense , as with many social animals , birds , and fishes , lies in their innumerability , that is , in their capacity to reproduce ? in which , for trees , longevity plays a major part . Perhaps it is this passive , patient nature of their system of self-preservation that has allowed man , despite his ancient fears of what they may harbor in terms of other nature ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to see something that is also protective , maternal , even womblike in their silent depths . All through history trees have provided sanctuary and refuge for both the justly and the unjustly persecuted and hunted . In the wood I know best there is a dell , among beeches , at the foot of a chalk cliff . Not a person a month goes there now , since it is well away from any path . But three centuries ago it was crowded every Sunday , for it is where the Independents came , from miles around along the border of Devon and Dorset , to hold their forbidden services . There are freedoms in woods that our ancestors perhaps realized more fully than we do . I used this wood , and even this one particular dell , in The French Lieutenant 's Woman , for scenes that it seemed to me , in a story of self-liberation , could have no other setting . This is the main reason I see trees , the wood , as the best analogue of prose fiction . All novels are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? even when , at an extreme , they deny the possibility of its existence . Some such process of retreat from the normal world ? however much the theme and surface is to be of the normal world ? is inherent in any act of artistic creation , let alone that specific kind of writing that deals in imaginary situations and characters . And a part of that retreat must always be into a " wild , " or ordinarily repressed and socially hidden , self : into a place always a complexity beyond daily for artistic ) reality , never fully comprehensible , mappable , explicable , eternally more potential than realized , yet where no one will ever penetrate as far as we have . It is our passage , our mystery alone , however miserable the account that is brought out for the world to see or hear or read second-hand . The artist 's experience here is only a special ? unusually prolonged and self-conscious ? case of the universal individual one . The return to the green chaos , the deep forest and refuge of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that psychiatrists ? and torturers ? tell us is essential to the human mind . Without it , it disintegrates and goes mad . If I cherish trees beyond all personal ( and perhaps rather peculiar ) need and liking of them , it is because of this , their natural correspondence with the greener , more mysterious processes of mind ? and because they also seem to me the best , most revealing messengers to us from all nature , the nearest its heart . 0 RELIGION is the only religion , no church the true church ; and natural religion , rooted in love of nature , is no exception . But in all the long-cultivated and economically exploited lands of the world our woodlands are the last fragments of comparatively unadulterated nature , and so the most accessible outward correlatives and providers of the relationship , the feeling , the knowledge that we are in danger of losing : the last green churches and chapels outside the walled civilization and culture we have made with our tools . And this is so however far we may have fled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , interest in the wild ? or use of its imagery to describe our more hidden selves and mental quirks . To see woods and forests merely scientifically , economically , topographically , or aesthetically ? not to understand that their greatest utility lies not in the facts derivable from them , or in their timber and fruit , or their landscape charm , or their utility as subject matter for the artist ? proves the gathering speed with which we are retreating into outer space from all other life on this planet . Of course there are scientists who are aware of this profoundest and most dangerous of all our alienation , and warn us of it ; or who see hope in a rational remedy , in more education and knowledge , in committee and legislation . I wish them well in all of that , but I am a pessimist ; what science and " reason " caused , they can not alone cure . As long as nature is seen as in some way outside us , frontiered and foreign , separate , it is lost both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ private and public , human and nonhuman , can not be divorced ; any more than nature , or life itself , can ever be truly understood vicariously , solely through other people 's eyes and knowledge . Neither art nor science , however great , however profound , can finally help . I pray my pessimism is exaggerated , and that we shall recover from this folly resenting the fact that we are , for all practical purposes , caged on our planet , of pretending that our life on it is a temporary inconvenience in a place we have outgrown , a boardinghouse we shall soon be leaving , and for whose other inhabitants and whose contents we need have neither respect nor concern . Scientists speak of biological processes re-created in the laboratory as being done in vitro ? in glass , not in nature . The evolution of human mentality has put us all in vitro now , behind the glass wall of our own ingenuity . There is a spiritual corollary to the way we are currently deforesting and denaturing our planet . In the end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We might as soon start collecting up the world 's poetry , every line and every copy , to burn it in a final pyre ? and think we should lead richer and happier lives thereafter .
