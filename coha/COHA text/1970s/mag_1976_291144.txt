From the huge , ocher-red viewing stand of Peking 's vast T'ien An Men Square , China 's newly ordained Party Chairman Hua Kuo-feng confidently smiled and waved . Below were assembled more than 1 million representatives of China 's proletarian masses , waving placards , paper bouquets and red flags . The well-organized 80-minute demonstration , which was shown on television around the world , marked the official unveiling of China 's post-Mao leadership alignment . It also celebrated the end of at least one chapter in a bitter six-week power struggle that saw China 's four top radical leaders , including Mao Tse-tung 's widow Chiang Ch'ing , disgraced and placed under arrest . Peking editors waxed absolutely poetic about the new spirit of China : " Everywhere in our motherland , orioles sing and swallows dart . " <P> Grizzled Veterans . With Hua on the viewing stand were the country 's other leaders : the top army commanders and the entire membership of the Politburo ( except the ailing Liu Po-ch'eng ) . The four purged radicals-Chiang Ch'ing , Chang Ch'un-ch'iao , Wang Hung-wen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not replaced , thus reducing the membership of the party 's decision-making elite from 16 to twelve . Sinologists believe that three grizzled , durable veterans of Mao Tse-tung 's Long March who had long and close associations with China 's late pragmatic Premier Chou En-lai will have pre-eminent influence in the new era of Hua : <P> &gt; Marshal Yeh Chien-ying , 77 , Defense Minister and , because of recent deaths and purges , apparently the sole Vice Chairman of the party . China 's top military figure since 1971 , Yeh is thought to be a chief proponent of continuing Sino-American dtente . <P> &gt; Li Hsien-nien , 69 , senior Vice Premier and , until his promotion last year , China 's Finance Minister . Li remains the country 's chief economic planner . Some China watchers anticipated that Li would be named Premier , but Hua , at least for now , holds that job as well as the party chairmanship . <P> &gt; Ch'en Hsi-lien , 63 , Vice Premier and commander of the Peking Military Region . Once a peasant guerrilla fighter , Ch'en @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support was probably essential in Hua 's lightning coup against the radicals . <P> Hua ascended the rostrum to the accompaniment of Sailing the Seas Depends on the Helmsman-roughly , China 's version of Hail to the Chief and a song that heretofore had been played only in Mao 's honor . Significantly , the new helmsman was dressed in full military uniform , as were almost one-third of the other officials on the reviewing stand-a clear sign of the army 's importance as the guarantor of the new leadership . Hua did not speak during the coronation-type ceremony , leaving the keynote task to Peking 's mayor , Wu Teh , who assured the crowd that the new Chairman had the blessing of the old . " With you in charge , I 'm at ease , " Mao is said to have told Hua.
