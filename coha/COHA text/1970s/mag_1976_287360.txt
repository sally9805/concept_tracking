THE SORCERER OF BOLINAS REEF <P> by CHARLES REICH <P> 266 pages . Random House . $8.95 . <P> <P> First there was Charles Reich outstanding law student , clerk of Supreme Court Justice Hugo Black and button-down member of an aggressive Washington law firm . Then came Charles Reich Two : the Yale professor who put his pulse on the thumb of the nation when he ratified and amplified the ' 60s counterculture in The Greening of America , the most profoundly naive bestseller of the period . The Sorcerer of Bolinas Reef introduces the third Reich , a San Francisco homosexual who now quotes Joni Mitchell and Walt Whitman and preaches an herbal-essence philosophy called " evolutionary rebellion . " <P> Who said there are no second acts in American life ? The desire to make radical changes in what is now called one 's " lifestyle " is a fundamental of American character . " A man builds a house for his old age and sells it before the roof is finished , " Alexis de Tocqueville wrote some 140 years before Charles Reich sublet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Reich 's evolutionary rebellion is , in fact , a mobile-home version of Consciousness III-that pot-scented notion that mankind can somehow escape civilization and its discontents . Gnomic and unpolitical , ER is part of the new solipsism and characteristic of a lot of people who , disillusioned by the radical politics in the ' 60s , withdrew into the various styles of the " personal growth " movement . Reich 's version is a kind of Peter Pantheism in which he offers his own autobiography as a guide to a never-never land . Natural beauty and loving friends heal the troubled soul there , and such things as lust , jealousy , guilt and evil hardly seem to exist . <P> Reich 's account of his life is essentially a thin outline on which he strings the clichs of the gray flannel ' 50s and the youth rebellion at Berkeley and Yale . As in The Greening of America , he wafts nonsensical generalizations like dandelion seeds : " An alienated society is no less a political tyranny because the oppression is found within each individual , rather than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dictator . " <P> As to Reich 's own sex life , the hard news is that Reich did not have sex with another person until he was 43 . The disclosure elicits a certain amount of sympathy , but his account of that first time-with a San Francisco male prostitute-reads a bit like one of those dated popular English novels in which the schoolmistress has a fleeting love affair during her holiday in Italy . It is difficult to imagine that Reich 's lonely years and late-blooming sex life have not affected the way he looks at the world . This , however , is not a critical issue . Attempting a vision , Reich has only come up with a rosy view-as if Rod McKuen had turned Rousseau 's Social Contract into a TV special . <P> R.Z. Sheppard
