Almost two years after resigning as Watergate Special Prosecutor , Leon Jaworski has finally produced his long-expected account of the anxious , turbulent , year-long investigation that he directed into the worst scandal in American history . His book The Right and The Power ( Gulf Publishing Co. and Reader 's Digest Press ; $9.95 ) is a straightforward , rather dry rendering , often made even drier by lengthy quotes from legal documents . Jaworski , who is donating the royalties to his own nonprofit foundation ( which supports religious and educational projects ) , nonetheless offers some intriguing anecdotes and pungent observations . Among them : <P> &gt; On the bait that Richard Nixon 's Chief of Staff , General Alexander Haig , offered to Jaworski to become Special Prosecutor : " Haig said , ' You 're highly regarded , and it 's no secret that you 're high on the list for appointment to the Supreme Court . ' I suppressed a smile . The remark could have been part flattery , part fact , but I suspected it was all bait . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charges Jaworski read against him during a plea-bargaining session : " I read , ' The last possible charge is mutilation of a Government document Ehrlichman 's face twisted . He hurled the pencil to the floor forcefully and said , ' That I did not do ! ' " <P> &gt; On Haldeman 's offer to testify against Ehrlichman and others in exchange for pleading guilty only to a single felony charge : " Haldeman 's lawyer John Wilson sought to keep the conversation going , trying a number of times to get the judge John Sirica to give some hint of the length of sentence Haldeman could expect . Each time the judge waved the query aside , repeating , ' He 'll have to take his chances . . . ' " <P> &gt; On the taped conversations between Nixon and Special Counsel Charles Colson : " ' Sleazy ' was the first word that came to my mind as I listened . . . It sounded like two cheap ward heelers talking in the rear room of a neighborhood dive . " <P> &gt; On Haig 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would make things " bloody " for Jaworski : " I finally said , ' I do n't care how tough he is . I 've come to grips with tough lawyers many times in many places , and some of them-well , St. Clair would n't make a pimple on their butts . ' " <P> &gt; On Nixon 's role in the Watergate coverup : " I had expected to find all sorts of wrongdoing by his aides , conduct unbecoming and even criminal , but it had never occurred to me that the President was in the driver 's seat . " <P> &gt; On Nixon 's resignation speech : " It was not the speech of a President who had violated his constitutional oath and duty by obstructing justice , by abusing the power of his office , by transforming the Oval Office into a mean den where perjury and low scheming became a way of life . " <P> &gt; On Senator James Eastland 's report of a call from Nixon after the President had resigned : " ' He Nixon was crying , ' Eastland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't let Jaworski put me in that trial with Haldeman and Ehrlichman . I ca n't take any more . " ' Eastland shook his head . ' He 's in bad shape , Leon . ' "
