The room is somewhat institutional , but someone , one day decided it had to look cheerful . There are , for example , curtains to disguise the barred window . There is also a television set , a couch and an ant farm . MARION is sitting on the couch . She is wearing a neat chenille housecoat . She is taking pills and making something of a ritual of it . She takes a pill , takes a sip of water , counts , takes another pill , another sip of water , counts . . . . MARION One . . . two . . . three . . . four . . . five . . . six . . . seven . . . eight . ( LEONA enters . She is wearing a diaphonous peignoir and nightgown ) . LEONA You 're first and I 'm second . MARION What ? ( MARION starts guiltily . She thrusts her handful of pills into the pocket of her robe . LEONA Are you going to sit there ? I always sit there . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , but it 's twenty minutes to Love of Life . MARION You 're kidding . LEONA You know . On TV . MARION You want to watch TV ? p. 3 LEONA Yes . MARION Here ? Now ? LEONA It is the TV Lounge . MARION ( not above enjoying the irony ) Love of Life . LEONA You want to sit there , eh ? It 's okay . You can sit there . I mean , I 'm not a slave to something as petty as my own chair in a tv lounge . MARION Sit where you want . LEONA I want to sit where you 're sitting . MARION ( moves ) Go ahead . I do n't want to watch tv anyway . LEONA Why did you come in here then ? To watch the ant farm ? MARION I beg your pardon ? LEONA I hate that ant farm . Why would they have an ant farm in a place like this ? I always imagine the ants tapping on the glass . ( imitates an ant ) . Help . Help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) I always think it 's a lucky thing you ca n't see their little faces , their big little eyes , saying " Why am I trapped in here ? What have I done ? " Ants ca n't cry , can they ? p. 4 MARION I do n't think so . LEONA I wonder what they do instead . MARION I do n't care very much about ants . LEONA Sometimes I ca n't cry . I have to keep all my emotions bottled up inside . Do you ever have that feeling ? MARION I do n't want to disturb you . You 're going to be very busy watching Love of Life LEONA You do n't like ants , you do n't like Love of Life . . . . MARION Of course not . LEONA I know why you came in here , it 's the only place on the floor you can smoke , am I right ? Have a cigarette . MARION I do n't smoke . LEONA You do n't smoke . You hate ants . You do n't watch tv . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was looking for a little peace and quiet . LEONA I hate peace and quiet . MARION So I see . LEONA I was in a hospital once , they left you in isolation for the first twenty four hours . It was supposed to bring you down , you know , but I do n't like being alone . I get claustrophobia of the soul . . . . Hey are you going somewhere ? p. 5 MARION Back to my room . LEONA You do n't have to go . MARION I know that . LEONA If you 're looking for peace and quiet you 'd be better off with me . MARION I like being alone . I can see that for you it would be cruel and unreasonable punishment , but I like it . LEONA The nurses are going crazy out there . Because you know they get everyone 's pills and put them in those little paper cups and take them around to everybody just before Search For Tomorrow . . . MARION What pills ? LEONA Somebody lifted them . Somebody has twenty five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somebody is going to try and pop them all . MARION I do n't know anything about any pills . LEONA You look nervous . MARION I 'm not nervous . LEONA Cigarette ? MARION I do n't smoke . LEONA You said that before , did n't you ? I do n't know why I did n't remember that because people say I 'm a very good listener . I got points for that when I won Miss Toronto Argonaut . Good listening and swimsuit . ( LEONA looks expectant but there is no response from MARION. ) p. 6 LEONA You 're not a very good listener are you ? MARION What ? LEONA I said I won Miss Toronto Argonaut . MARION I heard you . LEONA So most people say " Hey Wow " and I say " It was nothing really " and most people say " Tell me more about it , being Miss Toronto Argonaut " and I do . MARION I do n't care very much about beauty contests . LEONA Figures . MARION What do you mean by that ? LEONA Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? LEONA I mean , I guess it 's because you do n't care very much about your own appearance . . . MARION What do you mean by that ? LEONA I mean your hair . . . MARION My hair is very fine . LEONA Sure it is . It 's very pretty fine hair . MARION Do not patronize me. p. 7 LEONA And you have high cheekbones . MARION It 's been nice meeting you . LEONA You did n't meet me yet . MARION I know . LEONA I wonder who took all those pills . Because a person who would steal pills from a nursing station is probably in a very depressed state of mind , would n't you say ? MARION I feel depressed . I feel sick . LEONA Nurses hate depression . That 's why they are so cheerful all the time . ( She imitates . Her nurse imitation sounds like her ant imiation . ) LEONA " Why do n't we take another nice bath ? " No one in this hospital feels depressed about being dirty , anyway . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LEONA I hate nurses . Some people think they 're nice , but I think they 're awful . MARION I do n't care very much to talk about nurses . LEONA You know the kind of people who like nurses ? Guys . Is n't that true ? I do n't think it 's anything personal . It 's just that nurses are mostly girls and guys like girls and girls do n't like girls very much , is n't that true ? p. 8 MARION No . LEONA Huh ? MARION No , it is n't . LEONA You do n't have much contact with reality MARION I try to relate to people as individuals . LEONA You do n't like me . And I 'm a woman . MARION I do n't care what sex you are . LEONA You would n't like me if I was a guy . I 'd be a really neurotic guy . I 'd be so confused about my sexual identity . MARION I do n't dislike people because of their religion or their colour or their age or their sex . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MARION What pills ? LEONA Because you like everyone so much ? All ages , races , religions , sexes , individuals . MARION What pills ? LEONA You know why all these little paper cups are sitting here on the coffee table ? Because one of the occupational therapists was in here , teaching you how to make a paper flower . MARION They 're from the pills . p. 9 LEONA I hate those occupational therapists . They 're just as cheerful as the nurses . ( EEONA begins to build a paper flower . She imitates . Her occupational therapist imitation sounds like an ant . ) " Here 's a pretty paper flower you can make from muffin liners and hairpins . " MARION What are you going to do ? LEONA About what ? MARION I took eight pills . LEONA Then I came in before you took the rest , right ? MARION Are n't you going to call someone ? LEONA If I call someone , you 'll only get in trouble . MARION Well , thanks . . . LEONA You 're welcome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to stay here , you can . Because everyone 's running around out there . If you do n't mind if I watch tv . MARION You mean I should . . . . It 's all right if I. . . LEONA Be my guest . MARION I 'm beginning to feel really sleepy . p. 10 LEONA Do n't yawn , please . If somebody yawns , I always feel like yawning . MARION I 'm beginning to feel dizzy . The ends of my fingers feel numb . LEONA And you 're swaying back and forth . MARION And I 'm swaying back and forth . LEONA I guess you 'd like to sit down here , right ? On the chesterfield . MARION Thanks . LEONA ( not moving ) I guess you 'd like me to move . MARION ( still standing ) I feel like it 's snowing . My fingers and toes feel cold and I 'm falling asleep in the snow . ( LEONA yawns ) . I feel like I 'm falling . Everything sounds as if it 's further and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LEONA . LEONA extricates herself ) . LEONA Boy , some people will do anything to get to sit on that chesterfield . MARION Thanks . LEONA You do n't care very much about other people , do you ? MARION What ? p. 11 LEONA I mean , if you did , you would n't lie flat out there right in front of the tv , fifteen minutes before Love of Life . MARION I do n't care about Love of Life . I do n't think Love of Life is important . LEONA Compared to what ? MARION Compared to anything . Compared to Twinkie Bars . Nobody cares about Love of Life . LEONA I do . MARION I do n't care what you care about . LEONA Do you remember when Connie and Dr. Gord got married ? MARION Of course not . LEONA It was one Thursday afternoon and they put the invitation right up on the screen . Mr. and Mrs. Alistair Cavanaugh request the pleasure of your company at the wedding of their daughter Constance Marie and so on . So my sister Heather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was going to go to the wedding , well , why not , eh ? So she and all her girlfriends planned it out and the day the wedding was going to be on they all got dressed up in long dresses and hats and each one brought a cake over and they were sitting there at the wedding , I mean they were sitting at Heather 's and the wedding was on tv and Heather took the plastic covers off the arms of the furniture and they were drinking tea , but of course that 's not all they were drinking . So in the middle of all that there 's a ring at the doorbell and Heather goes to the door in this long dress and hat and of course she was pregnant at the time so she was sticking out to here . And it was the paper boy ! At the door ! ( LEONA notices MARION is not reacting to her story ) Hey Wow ! Hey wiat a minute ! ( She shakes MARION ) . Hey wake up ! Wake up ! What 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bracelet ) Hey , Marion , wake up ! p. 12 MARION ( comes up struggling ) What 's the matter ? LEONA You fell asleep . MARION I 'm supposed to fall asleep . LEONA I was telling you a story and you were n't there all of a sudden . MARION Everything is blurry . Everything is swimming in front of my eyes . LEONA So my sister Heather could n't take the Toronto Star anymore , of course . And she did n't know what to say to Frank , that 's her husband because he really liked the crossword and he ca n't read the TV Guide in the Sun as easy . You know They have in the . For the movies . So Frank knew as long as he could count to two and a half there was n't much could passed him . MARION Do n't . LEONA Do n't you want to hear the end of the story ? I mean , now you 're awake ? MARION No ! LEONA Why not ? MARION I am trying to commit suicide ! LEONA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried to commit suicide before , you know . That 's why I 'm here . p. 13 LEONA I figured . MARION But not with pills . That 's crazy , is n't it ? I suppose most people try pills but I do n't even take aspirin very often so I thought it would be easier , perhaps , the first time I tried sitting in the garage with the engine running but everyone knows I hate driving so they all wondered what I was doing there . So the second time I turned the gas on , in the gas on in the kitchen but everyone knows that I hate cooking too . LEONA I had a girlfriend who tried to gas herself . She got bored sitting there . And she got a really bad headache . And then her social worker came to the door . I hate social workers . They 've got no sense of fun . MARION Gas did n't work for me either . LEONA Yeah . I see that . ( Pause . LEONA has picked up her flower again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know very much about sleeping pills ? LEONA I had a friend who tried that too . MARION Do you know how many it takes ? LEONA Her doctor said eight would mean she would n't need a refill . p. 14 MARION ( a little pleased , a little in awe of what she 's done ) . Oh . LEONA He was wrong . MARION Oh . LEONA She booked a room in the Harbour Castle and she took eighteen but she still woke up the next day . She was so wingy she thought she could wade across Lake Ontario . She even forgot she knew how to swim . ( MARION sighs . She spreads her pills out on the table and begins taking more . LEONA continues to work on her flower ) . MARION Nine . Ten . Eleven . Twelve . Thirteen . LEONA Are you still interested in suicide ? Fourteen . LEONA What are you trying to do , get yourself in shape for it ? MARION What do you mean ? LEONA Those are vitamin pills . MARION What do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Complex . Halibut Oil . Vitamin C. You 've got mostly B complex here , they 're the yellow and brown ones . That 's going to be good for your nerves . p. 15 MARION What are you talking about ? LEONA You do n't think those nurses are going to leave sleeping pills lying around in little paper cups , do you ? MARION Of course they 're sleeping pills . LEONA I mean , nurses may be boring , but they are n't dumb . MARION They 're sleeping pills . I 'm sleepy . LEONA You do n't think they give out sleeping pills right before Search For Tomorrow . MARION You knew all the time . LEONA You should have known too . MARION You let me take all those vitamins . LEONA Lots of people take lots of vitamins . Some people even think it 's good for you . MARION It is n't good for you . LEONA It is n't like you cared about the long term effects . MARION I never even take askpirin , do n't you understand that ? LEONA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smoking two years ago , even though there are times to this day I could kill for a cigarette . I set myself up to take fourteen sleeping pills and now nothing 's going to happen to me . Nothing . p. 16 LEONA Your name is Marion , is n't it ? MARION This is not the moment for introductions . LEONA I read it on your identification bracelet . You want to read my identification bracelet ? LEONA ( continues as MARION ignores her ) . It says Leona . MARION What am I supposed to do now ? LEONA I do n't get you . MARION How am I supposed to kill myself ? LEONA You are n't supposed to kill yourself . MARION I feel like a fool . LEONA You know what I think . MARION Oh sure . You think I 'm crazy . LEONA An attempted suicide is a cry for help . Even if you 're only taking vitamins . So you cried for help and it 's lucky I am here to help you . MARION You ? LEONA I have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ People say I 'm very down to earth . p. 17 MARION Oh no , thank you anyway . LEONA And what you need , you know , you need to stay in contact with reality . MARION I have to stay in contact with reality , do n't I ? Even if it kills me . LEONA You 're relating to me . That 's good . MARION Get away from here . LEONA I 'll help you . MARION Get away . LEONA That 's good . Hostility is a kind of relating . MARION Get out of here . LEONA You hate me , do n't you . MARION I do n't hate anyone . LEONA You know why you hate me ? It 's because I used to be Miss Toronto Argonaut . MARION Leona . Miss Toronto Argonaut . And you 're supposed to keep me hanging on . LEONA That 's right . MARION You 're supposed to keep me in contact with reality . LEONA What 's wrong with that ? p. 18 MARION Let 's just say you do n't seem very real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ? MARION And you 're too good to be true . Your hair and your fingernails and your eyelashes . What are you here for ? A silicone implant ? LEONA I already had that . MARION What have you got ? An ingrown false eyelash . LEONA I tried to kill myself . MARION You ? LEONA I think it was , you know , like a cry for help . MARION Is that supposed to be funny ? LEONA Do you know people who joke about suicide ? MARION People who try to commit suicide are not usually as entertaining as you are . LEONA I 'm used to it . I tried it before . MARION You what ? LEONA Besides , I 'm really well-adjusted . MARION I 'm glad . LEONA Thank you . MARION Will you leave me alone now ? p. 19 LEONA You see , you do care about other people . MARION No , I do n't . LEONA You said you were glad I was well-adjusted . You showed concern . That 's the first step toward mental health . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should tell me why you want to kill yourself . MARION Not on your life . LEONA That 's what the shrinks always ask you . MARION I have no reason , of course . It 's a totally unreasonable act , is n't it ? LEONA It 's a cry for help . MARION I have no reason . Everything is fine . I sometimes think I 've never been so happy . Everything will be fine . As soon as I find someone to help with the children . As soon as I can work again . As soon asfloor . I want to put my life in order . It 's not so unusual . Order . What 's wrong with that ? Simplicity . LEONA The last time I tried to commit suicide I spent six months in a looney bin . What a lot of crazies . You think the fifth floor here is bad but that one was a real fruitcake factory . Even the doctors were crazy . But I was philosophical about it . I decided , you know , to use my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months I was there , I talked to the other patients , you know , and I was able to cure completely three poor women who were diagnosed as paranoid schizophrenics. p. 20 MARION I hate you , you stupid cow . LEONA I 'm going to try and help you anyway . MARION Ha . LEONA I 've always liked helping people . That 's why I won so many beauty contests . You do n't get marked just for being beautiful , you know . You get twenty points for character . I got high points for beauty and high points for character and low points for talent and general knowledge which is why I was n't Miss Grey Cup . MARION Go away . LEONA I think I lost points for sense of humour too . I do n't think they like you to have a sense of humour . MARION If you want to help me you can give me a cigarette . LEONA Ha . Ha . MARION Give me one . LEONA You 're lucky that I have a sense of humour . MARION Give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Two years ago . That took a lot of moral strength . MARION I do n't want to smoke it . I want to eat it . I want to poison myself . p. 21 LEONA A clinical interest ( offering pack ) Can you do that ? Really ? How long does it take ? ( MARION takes a cigarette and lights it ) MARION You 'll believe anything , wo n't you ? LEONA ( after watching MARION smoke ) I 've noticed one thing about you . You have a kind of rigid personality . Or if you want to put it in a more positive way , you 're a perfectionist . Now I do n't mean that 's a bad thing , but the world is n't perfect , is it ? ( MARION blows smoke in LEONA 's face ) . I think it 's a good sign . That you started smoking again . Because it 's like relating , is n't it ? It 's like relating to yourself . I mean , smoking is a human failing . You see . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think that 's a good sign . ( Pause . MARION is smoking furiously . She does n't look human . She looks like a smoking machine . ) But then I 've always been an optimist . MARION I think Love of Life is on . LEONA Another way to feel better about going on is to look on the bright side . MARION I think Love of Life is on this channel . ( She is studying the ant farm ) p. 22 LEONA Look at someone else 's troubles and your own do n't seem so bad . MARION Dr. Gord &amp; Connie Ant . LEONA I think all my trouble comes from being beautiful . MARION I love Love of Life . LEONA And another thing about me is I 'm a natural victim . MARION Dr. Gord and Connie are dead and all the other little ants are crying . . LEONA I remember one time I got beat up . MARION . . . But we 're invited to the funeral . . . . LEONA . . . My husband Larry beats me up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't we get dressed up in our long dresses and hats and get lip gloss and eye gloss and blusher and eyeliner and . . . . LEONA Larry beats me up . Why would he do that ? MARION He was probably bored . LEONA You 're a very selfish person , are n't you ? You 're only concerned with yourself . MARION I 'm concerned with these ants . p. 23 LEONA You should do something positive with your life . MARION I 'll free the ants . ( She knocks the ant farm off the table . ) LEONA What 's the use of that ? MARION It broke . LEONA Of course it broke . It 's made out of glass . MARION ( produces a dangerous looking shard of glass ) I mean the glass broke . LEONA What are all those ants going to do in the Fifth Floor nonviolent ward ? MARION ( stomping on ants ) I 'll get violent . LEONA Stop that ! MARION They do n't have to stay on the fifth floor . And neither do I. ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marion ! ( Blood . LEONA tries to wrestle the glass away from MARION ) . Marion . Do n't be stupid . You should get another interest . MARION Arm wrestling . LEONA They have a discussion group here tonight , you know . After the family viewing hour . So we wo n't have to watch Starsky and Hutch. p. 24 MARION I do n't have to watch Starsky and Hutch . LEONA ( still wrestling like Jacob and the Angel ) . It 's on women 's lib . MARION I do n't care about women 's lib . LEONA ( disarms MARION ) But you should . MARION I hate the sound of it . Women 's lib . I hate people who say " women 's lib " without knowing what it means . LEONA What am I supposed to say ? Is there a new way to say it ? MARION I hate words used the wrong way all the time . LEONA Am I supposed to say women 's liberation ? MARION I hate the sound of that too . LEONA I know a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough to shut up about it ? LEONA You do n't believe me , do you ? You think just because I 'm blonde and I had my boobs done that I think like a Tammy Wynette record . MARION Yes I do . LEONA Let me tell you something . I was n't always blonde . p. 25 MARION That 's a joke , is n't it ? LEONA It 's a hassle being blonde but what else is there ? MARION You think I do n't have a sense of humour . Let me tell you I have a fine sense of humour . Ha . Ha . You see I 'm laughing . LEONA I used to try for a more natural beauty , you know what I mean ? MARION It 's just that sometimes , when I 'm laughing , it all stops , it 's like ice water dripping down my eyes . I feel physically sick . LEONA Natural beauty is too much trouble . I mean , chestnut highlights and sun streaks and they 've got you stuck there for hours while they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrapping it up in tin foil and it never stops and the best anybody ever says is you 've got nice hair except the ends are split from all that pulling around . MARION I am talking about despair . You are talking about split ends . LEONA So I decided to be blonde . I mean , why not , eh ? And it 's worked out real well except for my eyebrows . MARION What good is a sense of humour if you ca n't enjoy it ? LEONA But it is n't all just having more fun , being blonde , I mean , blonde 's are exploited too . I figure I have been exploited just as much as a blonde as I was when I had chestnut highlights but once or twice it was at more expensive places . p. 26 MARION You do n't understand me , do you ? LEONA Yes I do . MARION Ha Ha . See , I 'm alughing again . LEONA Because we have a lot in common . Because we 're both interested in politics . MARION Ha @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that being well-groomed means you 're not political . MARION You are something more than well-groomed , Leona . LEONA Once when I was a showgirl , we did a number where we burned our bras . It was sort of like working with a flaming baton , only harder . MARION Ha . Ha . Ha . Ha . LEONA I know all about it . Women 's liberation . We do n't control our own past . History . His story . We do n't control our own bodies . His storectomies . MARION I 'm going to kill myself laughing , Leona . LEONA Have you ever wished you were beautiful ? MARION Please go away . LEONA Because you could be beautiful , you know . I mean , you 're not bad-looking. p. 27 MARION Shut up , all right . LEONA Do you want me to help you with your make-up ? MARION No . LEONA You know what I 'd do . I 'd put brown , you know , on your eyelids , even though your eyes are blue . Because your eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MARION My eyes are not close together . LEONA Oh sure . MARION My eyes are wide apart . I 've got eyes like a stupid wild deer . LEONA Some guy told you that . MARION And I have very high cheekbones . LEONA I could put a little blusher here , you know , to highlight your cheekbones . MARION Have you got eyeliner ? LEONA We could draw the line sort of up and out . So you 'd look , you know , like a Bambi movie . MARION Have you got lip gloss ? LEONA Taking an interest in your appearance . MARION Yes . LEONA That 's the first step toward mental health . p. 28 MARION ( rather desperately ) This is fun , is n't it ? I 'm really enjoying myself . LEONA Pink ? MARION Ha Ha . LEONA Do you think pink ? MARION I feel sick , Leona . LEONA You need a little colour in your cheeks . MARION I do see the joke of it . Really I do . LEONA Do you want me to help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you want me to put your hair up ? Do you want me to hot comb your hair ? MARION I 'll look like you , Leona . I 'll look like Connie . ( LEONA begins to tease MARION 's hair . FADEOUT ) .
