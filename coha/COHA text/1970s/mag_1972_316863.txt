THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE <P> Directed by RONALD NEAME <P> Screenplay by STIRLING SILLIPHANT <P> and WENDALL MAYES <P> The S.S. Poseidon , bound from New York to Athens on her last voyage , is struck by " an enormous wall of water " and capsizes out of sight of land . Many passengers are killed immediately , others die slowly of injuries sustained during the first impact or in subsequent , secondary disasters such as floodings and explosions . The only slim hope of survival is to crawl torturously up through the gutted bowels of the ship toward the hull , where the steel is thinnest , hoping that after agonizing hours , help will arrive . <P> It is exciting even to think what film makers like John Boorman ( Deliverance ) and Don Siegel ( Dirty Harry ) might have done with this material . Alas , this movie was directed by Ronald Neame ( Scrooge ) who saw his role as that of a traffic cop , his main concern to get his actors where they were supposed to go without bumping into each other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a manifest of stereotypes , her cargo clichs . The hero is Reverend Frank Scott ( Gene Hackman ) , a sort of seagoing Malcolm Boyd who exhorts his shipboard congregation to " have the guts to fight for yourself-God loves brave souls . " Also among the survivors are a beefy cop ( Ernest Borgnine ) and his new wife , a reformed whore ( Stella Stevens ) ; a teen-age girl ( Pamela Sue Martin ) and her obnoxious little brother ( Eric Shea ) ; an aging Jewish couple ( Shelley Winters and Jack Albertson ) en route to the holy land ; a timid haberdasher ( Red Buttons ) ; a willowy rock singer ( Carol Lynley ) ; and a plucky waiter ( Roddy McDowall ) . With God as his copilot , and with a good deal of muscle , Hackman leads them ever upward , through sets that look as tortuous as a miniature golf course . <P> The script , which abounds in inane dialogue , is particularly vicious to women , who are portrayed as woefully helpless , weepy creatures who would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actors generally do better by the script than it deserves . Stella Stevens , looking well used but winning , is genuinely touching , Shelley Winters engagingly hammy . Gene Hackman , who seems to have the lion 's share of the bad lines , nevertheless acquits himself very nicely indeed . There is one scene in which he is required to pray to God , pleading with him and admonishing him , that Hackman , against all odds , manages to make believable.
