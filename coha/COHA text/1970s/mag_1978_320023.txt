The cuts are more in butter than in guns <P> No one ever said that cutting the budget would be easy , but for one top staffer at the Office of Management and Budget it has become a real nightmare . When W. Bowman Cutter , the aptly named Associate Director of OMB , drifts off to sleep these nights , his dreams run regularly to visions of hands that keep grabbing at him from all directions . The symbolism is plain : the hands belong to various interest groups that are desperately appealing to him to be exempted from budget cutbacks . Less than a month remains before Jimmy Carter presents to Congress his spending program for fiscal 1980 , and Cutter and his OMB colleagues are locked in a furious struggle with almost the entire federal bureaucracy . The goal is to pare spending requests and put together a budget that will not exceed the $30 billion deficit that Carter has pledged . Congress is in a cutting mood , but may change its mind when specific sacrosanct programs come up for the ax . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' indemnity fund to the space shuttle-has its defenders in Congress , and even the most seemingly inconsequential of cutbacks will inspire protests . OMB is recommending , for example , that the U.S. Travel Service , set up under John Kennedy to lure foreign tourists , be scrapped completely . The saving would be only $14 million , and the travel industry is already lobbying against the cut . The budget bashers have also cut 1,100 men from a Justice Department request for 14,000 border-patrol officers to intercept illegal immigrants from Mexico . Organized labor is expected to fight the recommendation on the theory that more border guards will mean fewer U.S. jobs lost to foreigners . OMB is pro posing to chop the Energy Department budget from $10.5 billion to $8.8 billion . The cuts would reduce research into alternative energy sources and the rate at which the U.S. builds up its strategic oil reserve . <P> The biggest battles will rage over defense and social welfare spending . Together , the Pentagon and Health , Education and Welfare take about 60% of the budget . OMB is recommending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under 9% from current levels and therefore not enough to offset inflation , which has been running at 91/2% . A defense budget of that size would not honor Carter 's NATO pledge of last spring to increase U.S. defense expenditures by 3% above inflation . Last week , however . Carter repeated that promise , suggesting that he could end up overruling the recommendation of his own budget advisers when he meets this week with Defense Secretary Harold Brown for an intensive look at fiscal 1980 military spending . <P> OMB recommends holding HEW 'S spending to some $195 billion next year . That would be an 8% rise and has brought a strong protest from HEW Secretary Joseph Califano about cuts in or alterations to 115 separate items in his thick spending request . <P> Among the most controversial of the changes is OMB 'S recommendation for a 26% cut in this year 's $10.8 billion in spending for public jobs-the so-called CETA program . By one Administration estimate , such a reduction could add more than 312,000 people to the nation 's unemployment rolls and would be widely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
