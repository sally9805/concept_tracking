The Administration claims the Soviets are playing fair <P> We have had five years of monitoring Soviet compliance with the Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty , and the record to date has been generally good . " <P> So insisted a U.S. arms-control expert last week as the Carter Administration stepped up its efforts to soften opposition in Congress to a new SALT treaty . The old pact expired in October , but the U.S. and Soviet Union have agreed to continue abiding by it while negotiators in Geneva bargain on a SALT II treaty . <P> If they reach an accord , it will have to be ratified by the Senate before taking effect . But fears persist on Capitol Hill that the Soviets have underhandedly violated the old SALT agreement and can not be trusted to keep a new one . Indeed , former Defense Secretary Melvin Laird accused Moscow of exactly that in a recent article in the Reader 's Digest titled , Arms Control : The Russians Are Cheating ! <P> In an 18-page report given to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee last week , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken full advantage of loopholes in the old treaty and operated at its uppermost limits . Nonetheless , the report concludes that Moscow has not committed any clear-cut violations of SALT I. <P> The report is based largely on the supersecret proceedings of the Standing Consultative Commission in Geneva , which is a joint U.S.-Soviet grievance board for monitoring SALT I , and the National Security Council 's Verification Panel . By making the information public , the Administration sought to refute Laird 's charges , as well as those made by other SALT opponents . The chief points : <P> &gt; In 1973 , the U.S. suspected ( presumably on evidence from spy satellites ) that the Soviets were violating the treaty by building new missile silos . When challenged , the Russians explained that the installations were actually new bunkers for missile technicians and thus not prohibited . According to the report , further investigation by U.S. intelligence sources determined that the Soviets were telling the truth . <P> &gt; In 1973 and 1974 , the U.S. spotted the Soviets using an antiaircraft radar system to track one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Soviets were illegally converting antiaircraft defenses into an antiballistic missile system . But the Soviets maintained that they were using the radar only to test the rocket 's navigation system . Still , notes the report , the radar activity ceased " a short time later . " <P> &gt;In 1974 , the U.S. thought that the Soviets might be breaking the treaty by taking steps , not spelled out in the report , that could enable them eventually to conceal installations from U.S. spy satellites . When the U.S. complained , the Soviets stopped the activities . <P> &gt;In 1975 , the Soviets began deploying monster SS-18 superrockets , which can carry as many as eight independently targetable warheads , despite a treaty provision that forbids the converting of land-based " light " ICBM launchers into vehicles for " heavy " ones . But since SALT I does not define " light " and " heavy , " the Administration decided that there was no violation . The report promises that this loophole will be closed in SALT II .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
