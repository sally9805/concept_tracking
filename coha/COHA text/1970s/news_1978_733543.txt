txt France ended one of its longest and most vehement election battles today , as voters prepared to choose a new National Assembly in the final round of balloting tomorrow . The election will decide whether the center-right Government coalition will stay In power , as Is now widely predicted , or whether it is to be replaced by a tenuous coalition of Socialists and Communists , who have pledged drastic change . Some polls , which favored the left opposition consistently for months , have been reversed since last Sunday 's first round put the total leftist vote at slightly under 50 percent . Close Race Expected Opinion polls taken over the last few days but not published because of a law forbidding their distribution in the period immediately before the election , showed the Government forces winning by a margin of anywhere from 8 to 40 seats in the National Assembly , the lower house of Parliament . The polls had substantially overestimated the left 's vote earlier and there was much argument among political observers whether they were simply wrong or had been unable to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Government leaders had described as a grave danger to France . It seemed likely that the second round would be much easier to forecast , with two-candidate races in the great majority of constituencies tomorrow , compared with an average of 10 in each constituency last week . Of the 491 contests , 68 were decided last week when candidates won a majority in the first round , while 8 were left with one candidate unopposed after withdrawals . There were 414 two- candidate races and one constituency had a three-way race . - One major French polling organization , I.F.O.P. , reported privately after a poll taken yesterday that many Socialist voters , particularly among white-collar workers , had now turned against their party because of its alliance with the Communists . The alliance , signed in 1972 , helped the Socialists rebuild themselves into a major forte after a long decline and brought them ahead of the Communists for the first time since World War II . But as their strength grew they came under increasing attack from their partners , and from last September until the day after the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they would honor their promise to back Socialists in tomorrow 's runoff . With the electorate divided roughly into quarters by the two major parties on the left and the two on the Government side . none could hope to win power without an alliance . After the result of the firstround voting became known , the Socialists and Communists formally agreed to support a single left-wing candidate in each legislative-district . The sudden Communist switch last Monday night from open attacks on the So ialists to renewal of their pact meant that 245 Socialist candidates in the election tomorrow would probably get the support of Communist voters . But the apparent cynicism of the last-minute deal seems to have fortified the distaste of many Socialists for any further involvement with Communists , and they are not likely to heed leadership appeals to back the 147 Communist candidates representing the combined left in other legislative districts . Pierre Mauroy , a leading Socialist who is Mayor of Lille , said earlier this week that the pact could no longer be accepted as a " yoke " weighing on the Socialists , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should stick to its own program instead of being tied to a compromise platform . If the left is defeated tomorrow , it ' is likely that strong elements among the Socialists will demand an end to the alliance , which was painstakingly built by the party 's leader , Francois Mitterand . Even Mr. Mitterrand , showing signs of bitter disappointment , did not contradict Mr. Mauroy 's suggestion . Mr. Mitterrand 's own future was in doubt , although he is still considered the only figure whose skill can hold the fragmented Socialists together . He is 61 , and this is his fourth major bid for national power . Despite what is widely considered to have been a phenomenally shrewd and able political balancing act , the best he has been able to do has been to come close to winning twice . The expected closeness of the result , combined with a constitutional provision that requires Cabinet ministers to give up their seats in Parliament , could create temporary difficulty in forming a new government . The prospective ministers would be replaced by alternates , who are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not allowed to vote in the Assembly until 90 days after they have taken their seats , a situation that could endanger majority control . This problem has provoked calls for changes in the current electoral system , devised under President Charles de Gaulle , which has tended to polarize the country . There is wide support for returning to some form of proportional representation which , while it could.lead to an increase in parties , could also break the left-right deadlock and make possible a government based on the center , a possibility favored by President Valdry Giscard d'Estaing . Although victory by the Government forces would rule out the kind of radical changes urged by the left , many supporters of the Government have already said that the strength of the opposition must be taken into account and new measures undertaken to respond to popular discontent . Aides to President Giscard d'Estaing have said that he intends to move in this direction , but his specific plans have not yet been revealed .                @ @ @ @ @
