AS TO THE MEANING OF WORDS by MARK EICHMAN <P> Abortion is not a subject about which people have no opinion one way or the other . As to the Meaning of Words uses no real names , but it is a documentary drama based on the 1975 Boston trial of Dr. Kenneth Edelin in which he was convicted of manslaughter for an abortion he had performed , a jury decision that was later reversed . The new play , at Stamford , Conn. ' s Hartman Theater Company , marks the debut of Mark Eichman , 27 . He sticks fairly closely to the reported facts . As a result , Act I , at least , verges on a classroom dissertation on abortion . <P> In the second act the verbal fencing of the prosecutor ( George Dzundza ) and the defense attorney ( Paul Collins ) markedly steps up the dramatic tempo . <P> One key witness ( Theodore Sorel ) testifies that the defendant , Dr. Winston Gerrard ( Earle Hyman ) , held the aborted fetus inside the patient 's uterus and counted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ devastating counterstroke , the defense attorney proves that the doctor could not have seen the clock-it had been removed for repairs . <P> Sociologically , Playwright Eichman is most astute in suggesting that the transfer of power from the Boston " blue-bloods " to the Irish Catholic majority has actually accentuated New England 's narrow puritan ethic . As Ned ( " Scooter " ) Ryan , Dzundza viscerally endows the prosecuting attorney with the instincts of a fox in a hen coop . Always grave and commanding in presence , Earle Hyman has to wait to the end of the play to deliver the doctor 's passion ate plea for the right of a woman to terminate her own pregnancy . <P> Once again , a regional theater has taken a commendable gamble on the sort of theme that gives a Broadway producer the shudders .
