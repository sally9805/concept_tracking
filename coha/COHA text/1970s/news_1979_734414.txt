txt Critical home heating oil shortages ? especially in- more rural areas of the United States ? now loom as a distinct possibility on this winter 's horizon . Despite the fact that the Carter administration 's goal to build up " middle distillate " oil stocks , which include heating oil , to 240 million barrels by the end of this month is within striking distance , much of this stockpiled oil is not flowing into the distribution pipelines to regional.storage tanks and to people 's homes . Among the reasons : ? Distributors are now receiving only 80 percent of the allocations they got from oil companies at this same time last year , according to the National Oil Jobbers Council ( NOJC ) , representing about 6,500 heating oil distributors across the nation . ? Spokesmen for some of the country 's major oil companies explain that jobbers are not getting all the oil they want because they generally want more than they did last year . ? Oil company spokesmen also say that one of the reasons the jobbers are not getting what they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ selling the oil on the " spot market " and making a fast and lucrative profit . ? In turn , Alan Darrow , a spokesman for the NOJC , says oil companies are hoarding supplies in order to sell these supplies at a higher price the longer they hold onto it . // From page 1 Heating oil pinch in rural America ? ? The Monitor has learned , furthermore , that new energy Secretary Charles Duncan Jr. , has admitted privately in a meeting with independent oil distributors that the Carter administration 's stockpiling program was ill-conceived because it did not , among other things , include the distributors in the overall plan to make sure enough heating oil was on hand this winter . Meanwhile , in a seven-page letter . to Mr. Duncan , Gov . Hugh Carey of New York also attacked the stockpiling program and said distributors in New York State were reporting that they were some 20 percent below oil allocations of last year . As of this writing , a spokesman for the Governor said he had not received a reply to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the possibility of spot shortages , " especially in the state 's so-called " north country " above the city of Albany , said the Governor 's assistant press secretary , William Snyder . Recently , too , the conference of Northeast Governors took the US Energy Department to task for the stockpiling policy . In essence , this policy requires oil company refiners to have 240 million barrels of oil middle distillate on hand in their storage tanks by Oct. 31 . As of Sept. 28 , the American Petroleum Institute ( API ) reported that inventories stood at 226.8 million barrels . Faced with the very real possibility that , as Governor Carey and others have charged , the first heavy snow will come and the rivers freeze before enough heating oil reaches the public , the Energy Department in the last few days has started to urge oil companies to get their distillage out into the consumer chain . " We are encouraging refiners to move the product right along the chain , " said Robert Cecil , a spokesman for the Energy Department 's Economic Regulatory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too late , warn independent home-heating oil jobbers and some oil company spokesmen . " You only have so many trucks " to move the heating oil to market , noted one major oil company spokesman . Much of the heating oil in the Northeast and Midwest is carried to distributor storage tanks by tanker on inland waterway systems ? and some of these do n't have that many more weeks before they begin to freeze over . Jerry Smith , manager of supply coordination and operation evaluation for Conoco , Inc. , formerly the Continental Oil Company , said , " I 'm sure that in some cases or in many cases there are heating oil distributors who are n't getting all they 'd like .... We had limited sales all summer because we had all of our customers in total asking for more product than ever . " Mr. Smith also alleged that one reason more home heating oil was not being distributed faster is that some dealers may indeed " sell that oil at a 15 percent markup on the spot market " instead of sending it on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I 'm not saying we 're doing that , " Mr. Smith added , referring to Conoco withholding supplies to distributors .
