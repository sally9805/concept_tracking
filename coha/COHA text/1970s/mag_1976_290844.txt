" Electable " - that will be the buzz word dominating the bitter Republican struggle , probably right down to the convention floor in Kansas City , Aug. 16 . The argument will be whether Gerald Ford or Ronald Reagan will have a better chance of beating the formidable Jimmy Carter in November . The very fact that doubts are being cast on the electability of a sitting President with the traditional advantages of incumbency is a measure of the trouble Ford is in . It is also a measure of how far Reagan has come from a shaky start , with no credentials in foreign affairs and with an essentially ideological appeal . <P> The jarring primary struggle that ended with the presidential nomination still maddeningly eluding both contenders obviously was only a prelude to Phase 2 of the 1976 campaign-an intense , even frantic pursuit of a relative handful of delegates who now may determine the nominee . <P> Reagan 's strength in that search was strikingly demonstrated last Saturday in Springfield , Mo. , when he inflicted yet another grievous wound on President Ford 's hopes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both real and psychological impact , Reagan won 18 of Missouri 's 19 at-large delegates . When added to the Missouri delegates already won by Reagan , the 18-1 victory gave him control of the 49-member Missouri delegation , with 30 votes to Ford 's 16 ( and three uncommitted ) . The only Ford delegate to survive Reagan 's weekend charge was Governor Christopher S. Bond , who himself suffered a setback in the Ford defeat : when Missouri hosts the Republican National Convention in Kansas City in August , the Governor will not even be chairman of the delegation . <P> By waging internecine warfare , Ford and Reagan create the risk that when the prize of the nomination is finally won , it will not be worth much . But both men have brought to that problem the philosophy of a baseball manager whose team is down three games in the World Series : win today or there 'll be no tomorrow . <P> In last week 's Super Bowl primaries , Ford swept up 88 delegates in Ohio to Reagan 's nine , though Reagan won 45% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ captured New Jersey 's 67 delegates . But Reagan won all 167 delegates in California 's winner-take-all primary . <P> In soundings by TIME correspondents after last week 's voting , uncommitted delegates who really favor one candidate or the other were allocated to their favorites . This process reduced the pool of genuinely uncommitted delegates to 67 , brought Ford 's total to 1,012 and Reagan 's to 921 , with 259 delegates yet to be chosen ( see chart ) .
