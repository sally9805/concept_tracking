txt Kidnaped newspaper heiress Patricia Hearst , 20 , speaking to her parents today for the first time in 17 days on a tape , sent to a San Francisco radio station , said : " No one is concerned about me any more . " Making critical remarks about the food for the poor distribution program set up by ter father , newspaper owner Randolph Hearst , to try to win her freedom , she said : " It sounds as if most of the food is of poor quality . " The first quarter-hour of the half-hourlong tape was spoken by a woman member of the Symbionese Liberation Army , the revolutionary group that kidnaped Miss Hearst from a Berkeley apartment Feb. 4 . IN A TIRADE against Hearst 's ? $2 million food program , which the S. L. A. has demanded be increased by $4 Mil- ? lion more in free ' food , the woman speaker said : " The Hearst Corp . and Hearst have not complied with our request . ' r Hearst , ? speaking in a plaintivevoice compared to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : % realize not that it 's the FBI that giants to murder me . I could have been Out ' of here by now . " THE S : L. A. MESSAGE said Miss llearst 's safety was linked to two of their members , now being held on murder charges in San Quentin Prison , end demanded that they be allowed to hold a nationally televised press conference . The two , Joseph Remiro , 27 , and Russell Little , 24 , charged with the Nov. 6 killing of an Oakland , Cal. , school superintendent , Marcus Foster , had demanded a " live " press conference on Feb. 21 to put forward their ideas for getting Miss Hearst 's release . Miss Hearst strongly criticized a remark by California Gov . Ronald Reagan last week in which he disapproved of poor people taking the handout food and said he hoped some of it was infected with botulism . She called the remark " careless and antagonistic . " Addressing a message to her fiance , Stephen Weed , 26 , who was badly beaten by her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , what do you have to say ? " A SPOKESMAN for radio station KSAN , which received the message , said it had received a telephone call this afternoon saying the tape would be found in the woman 's restroom of a downtown restaurant . A station official visited the rest room twice and found the tape on the second visit together with a California Automobile Association card made out in Miss Hearst 's name .. The S.L.A. had slammed down a screen of silence on . Miss Hearst 's situation 17 days ago when the Hearst Corp . said it would only agree to give $4 million more to the handout program if Miss Hearst was first released . The 20-year-old coed 's father told reporters at his Hills , borough home : " I do n't think there 's any question about it being her voice . " He said he wanted to read the tape 's transcript before making any statements on its contents . A week ago , Hearst , upset by the long silence of the kidnapers , had gone on radio and television to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or send a tape . IN HER 11-minute message , often made indistinct by a roaring sound on the tape , Miss Hearst said : " I do n't know the reasons why you could not comply with the good faith gesture fthe additional $4 million . " I know you could have done whatever the S. L. A. asked . " I mean , I know that you have enough money . " Until the good faith gesture is completed , negotiations for my release can not begin . " Miss Hearst said on the tape that S.L.A. " intelligence " reports on FBI activities indicate that Little and Remiro may be . executed in prison , and " because of these dangers . I have been receiving instructions on how to use a shotgun . " She said if her family would only have listened to the S.L.A. 's , earlier demand-for-$70 in free food for all needy Californians , " I would be out of here . " ? The tape also contained the voice of S.L.A. " Field Marshal Cinque " who called upon all oppressed people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her relatives for failing to help her . " It 's hard to believe that my sisters and cousins are n't doing anything , " she said . She appealed to them to " do something concrete to help me . " Meanwhile , the needy people in the lines where the Hearst food is being handed out , have begun to , show a change of attitude toward the S. L. A. There is no longer any criticism of the S. L. A. , according to Ludlow Kramer , " director of the food program . " The press keeps trying to let a sampling of opinion pro and con , " a volunteer at one of the food distribution centers said , " but everyone in line is for the food and they do n't care where it comes from . " A WOMAN WRAPPED in a heavy woolen coat spoke of Miss Hearst , saying , " I 'm sorry , she 's taken , but she 's took . " Others are even more blunt . " These people do n't give a damn ' about Hearst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . These people see the police shooting up . their neighborhoods all the time and they see people dying from all kinds of stuff . No , they do n't care . They just want the food . " It has been a full turnabout . Just after the kidnaping , when the kidnapers first demanded that food be provided for the needy ! , even in the poorest communities there was widespread criticism of the action . Many said that they would not accept the food even tho it was badly needed . But that sentiment seems to have disappeared . EACH WEEK now the food lines grow longer . Yesterday , 35,000 showed up for bags of free groceries . It is estimated that a million dollars has been spent for food and that 115,000 bags of groceries have been distributed . In explaining the shift in attitude toward the kidnapers , an observer of the program said : " The people who are getting the food know what instrument is making it possible .
