THE HAWK IS DYING <P> by HARRY CREWS <P> 226 pages . Knopf. $5.95 . <P> This gleefully savage little novel introduces fiction 's most dedicated bird freak since Augie March swept through Mexico with an eagle in tow . George Gattling , an otherwise sober , hardworking owner of an auto-seatcover business in Gainesville , Fla. , is determined to train a red-tailed chicken hawk , which he keeps perched on his wrist . Frequently consulting his talismanic text , The Art of Falconry by Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II , George croons to the hawk , fasts when it fasts , even takes it with him when he goes to bed with his girl friend . <P> Is this any way for a middle-aged Rotarian to get back in touch with the rhythms of nature and put some order in his life ? Novelist Crews ( Car , Karate Is a Thing of the Spirit ) makes it seem so . George 's devotion to the austringer 's discipline may be a little crazed , but Crews suggests that any obsession is better than inane passivity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see in the Southern Gothic remnants who make up his family and friends . As George passes through a series of farcial set pieces ( a woozy pot-smoking session at a residence for Florida State University students , a ghastly 4 a.m. confrontation with an embalmer in a mortuary ) , everything except the hawk seems to him as phony as his girl friend 's orgasms . <P> Crews works too hard to make the quasi-symbolic figure of the hawk dominate the book . When the bird is finally trained , Crews ' assertion that George has achieved harmony with " some immutable continuity " rings more of rhetoric than of convincing fiction . But much of the time Crews maintains the kind of control that extracts full shock value from an episode while at the same time making it seem hilarious . George 's retarded 22-year-old nephew Fred , for example , falls asleep while smoking in his waterbed and somehow manages to drown . Christopher Porterfield
