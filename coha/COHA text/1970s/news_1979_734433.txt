txt THE WHEELS screeched . . . . There was a deafening crash , and then a jumble of crunched up cars . The accident occurred under the " L " tracks at La Salle and Lake streets , and . passengers coming down the stairs gasped and ran toward the tangled mass of steel . " There must be somebody killed in that crash ! " a woman screamed . ' Let 's help them . " But several completely calm police officers stopped them , explaining that no one had been hurt ? it was just a scene from a movie being filmed in Chicago . The shaken spectators were convinced only when they saw the cameras . The spectacular crash was one of the scenes from " The Blues Brothers " movie now being filmed in and around the city . FOUR FULL length features are being shot in the Chicago area this year . In addition to " The Blues Brothers , " starring John Belushi , they include : " My Bodyguard , " with Ruth Gordon ; " The Hunter , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directed by Robert Redford . Four others were filmed here last year , and as mdny as 10 features and TV shows are expected to be filmed here in 1980 , " The film industry has discovered Chicago and finds it a treasure chest of sets and scenic locations , " said Dominick Frigo , a Chicago Police Department lieutenant who is the coordinator between the police department and the film industry . " They love Wacker Drive and the lower level for chase and mystery scenes . They think our lakefront and the lake are beautiful , and are intrigued with our ' L ' . You 'd think we just appeared overnight . " LT . FRIGO IS the man responsible for seeing that all runs smoothly for the movie companies . ? Frigo , a 20 year veteran , and his assistant , Marvin Mandel , handle the deli // He stages reel smashups // Cate task of negotiating with businessmen the need to close off streets . If this means businesses will lose revenue for the day , they explain that the film company will compensate them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrangement 's for location shooting with city departments and property owners , notify the ' police communications center where they will be filming and perform countless other chores . It 's important that . everything be done right because these films have brought money to Chicago  --  a lot of money . " The Blues Brothers " came here with a budget of $12 million for the Chicago scenes , then raised it to $18 million , then $26 million . It is now over $32 million . " The Blues Brothers ' " producers spent over $3.5 million during the threeday Labor Day holiday shooting schedule . From the standpoint of people involved , it was the largest scene ever shot on location In any big city , including Los Angeles and New York . Over 500 actors , portraying soldiers , police and civilians , were used in the scene . The film company also bought 60 old police cars and destroyed them all in smashup scenes . It also rented squad cars , driven by off-duty policemen , at the rate of $30 an hour for chase scenes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officers and a few sergeants he uses when a script calls for police or-crowd control . " I asked each commander to recommend four police officers he considered well qualified and who would like to do this work on their day off , " Frigo said . " I then screened them for neatness , good manners , a cooperative attitude with the film company and the public , and an even temperament , " Frigo explained . " I only use patrolmen and women . I have a few sergeants , but that 's only because there has to be someone in command if the call ' is for a large number of police officers . " You 'd be surprised how many cap . tains wanted to be on the list , " he smiled . " I told them I could n't pay them what their salaries called for since police personnel are paid the same rate as their salaries . The policemen do not speak any lines  --  they 're not actors . " The captains said they would work without pay . They sold they thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them down . They outrank us , and you ca n't have a captain taking orders from a patrolman or even a lieutenant . " He constantly receives calls from policemen asking to get on the list , but when he tells them they ca n't work a double shift , some change their minds . " They must be on their day off . I do n't allow double shifts because the officers would n't be able to do justice to either job , and I want them to look and act professional at all times , " Frigo explained . He recalled one incident in which extras were used to portray policemen . The extras were on a break , so they retired to the nearest neighborhood tavern where they sat at the bar drinking beer . " Mary Mandell walked in and nearly had a fit , " Frigo said . " He asked them ' What do you think you 're doing ? ' " They said , ' We 're having a beer ' . " Mary said ' Oh no you are n't . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not policemen . ' " He told them , ' You 're in uniform , and . the public does n't know whether you 're real policemen or actors . So while you 're portraying policemen , you act like professional police officers . " Frigo cringes when he sees how many " cop " shows portray police . " I watched them filming a scene in which two plainclothesmen were making an arrest . They did everything wrong , and without realizing it I told them , ' Nono never that way . ' They stopped the cameras , and Frigo showed them how real police investigators would do it . Since that time a new dimension has been added to his job . He is now a consultant  --  without pay . " I coach the actors on how the police work and what rules they have to follow . I just want to bring some realism to the screen , " he explained . When it comes to realism , directdrs and producers are overjoyed with many of Chicago 's locations . They have shot scenes at 43d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , , at the Civic Center , on the expressways and Lake Shore Drive  --  even in the communications center at police headquarters . Among the highlights Frigo remembers is one of the business days they had . " We had two chases going at the same time  --  one on the Eisenhower winding up at the Post Office , the other on Lake Shore Drive from Fullerton to Oak Street . Both were 55 mph chases for " The Blues Brothers . " All chase scenes are filmed in the early morning hours on weekends and holidays so city routine wo n't be disrupted , and because it 's safer . But even in the early morning hours there 's always somebody watching . A crew was shooting a scene in Old Town in which a yottng man , who is a karate expert , is set upon by five robbers as a squad car approaches . The " robbers " pounced on their Intended victim . The " police " ran to his aid while the karate expert chopped away at the " robbers . " A woman awakened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put in a 911 emergency call that a " Police Officer wds help ! " A dozen squads converged on the scene . The whole thing had to be shot over again . Frigo , who has had this assignment since May , 1978 , formerly worked in pa. trot and the intelligence division . Mandel has had his job nearly as long . Offi ? cer Robert Logay is responsible for making up the sometimes complicated orders for the filming events . Both Frigo and Mandel say this Is the most exciting assignment in their ca. reers . Mandel even appeared.in one of the films  --  portraying a policeman , net ' . rally .
