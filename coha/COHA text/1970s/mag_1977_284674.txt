A HISTORY OF THE AMERICAN FILM <P> by CHRISTOPHER DURANG <P> Myth is not dead . It has just taken a job in the movies . Hitchcock is our Homer , Gone With the Wind is our Iliad , and , taken together , a hundred cowboy movies make up the Odyssey of the Late Show . Hollywood 's images have become the myths of the 20th century , and somewhere in the depths of our unconscious are mingled words and pictures from the real and the reel : Abraham Lincoln and Raymond Massey , George Patton and George C. Scott , Fanny Brice and Barbra Streisand . <P> Christopher Durang , 28 , is a grandchild of the movie age , and his play , A History of the American Film , is a comic memorial to our movie mania . In a little over two hours , Durang recomposes America 's entire cinematic history , from Orphans of the Storm to The Exorcist , including everything in between , from the screwball comedies of the ' 30s to Elizabeth Taylor screaming at Richard Burton in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always take an unexpected turn , however , and he proves that there is nothing so funny as the cliche of a different color . <P> Somewhere about 1942 , for example , the play stops at Now , Voyager and the famous love scene in which Paul Henreid lights two cigarettes and hands one to Bette Davis . Durang 's Henreid standin , a duplicate of double-breasted elegance , suavely does the same , but his Bette Davis is hilariously different . " I 'm sorry , " she says , " I do n't smoke . " The vision " of Henreid nervously puffing two cigarettes is a small jewel of farce . <P> Later , the theater swells with the sounds of As Time Goes By , and it is Casablanca 's turn . But in this revisionist history , Ingrid Bergman does not ask Sam to play it again . Humphrey Bogart sends her off in her airplane telling her that the problems of two people do n't amount to a hill of beans in this crazy world , but she only complains about that lousy music @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " <P> By the end of the spring , playgoers in three cities will have had a chance to hear Durang 's words . The play had its premiere at the Hartford Stage Com pany in March . A totally different pro duction , with a separate cast and an other director , was unveiled at the Mark Taper Forum in Los Angeles last month ; even while that is still running , a third , also different version will open this week at Washington 's Arena Stage . <P> The Los Angeles production , which is reviewed here and which closes in June , is skillful and energetic . The actors , some of them temporary refugees from the movies they are parodying , assume their ever changing roles with suit able off-center fidelity . Special praise should go to Udana Power , who maintains a wide-eyed innocence through more than 50 years of changing features , and to Roger Robinson , whose five parts include both the piano player from Casablanca and Viola , the archetype of all comic maids . As Viola he is transcendentally ridiculous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ zither that is about to lose its strings . <P> Director Peter Mark Schifter maintains a fast pace . He wisely realizes that if he relaxes even momentarily , this spirited farce will fall down , like a top that has lost its spin .
