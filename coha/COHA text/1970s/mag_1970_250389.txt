" For the first time in 25 years I 'm seeing the world without an alcoholic haze , " Richard Burton boasted last week . And all because wife Elizabeth bet her convivial Welshman that he could n't abstain for three months . A trimmer Burton has not only won the wager ( a kiss or something ; he forgets ) , but has stretched his dry period to nearly six months . Lest his public misunderstand his sober ways , Burton begged his interviewer : " Please do n't make me out to be against alcohol . I 'll get all sorts of letters from the temperance people , and I certainly do n't want to encourage their cause . I owe a lot to booze , so I do n't want to offend it . " <P> The friendship between former Senator George A. Smothers and President John F. Kennedy was firm , but often tried . Cuba was the toughest trial , as newly opened documents at the John F. Kennedy Memorial Library showed last week . From the 1960 presidential campaign onward , Smathers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The President listened until the Bay of Pigs invasion , after which he told his friend : " George , I do n't want you to talk to me any more about Cuba . " Smathers stopped-for a while . But one evening at an informal supper , Smathers says : " I raised the question of Cuba and what could be done . He took his fork and hit his plate , and it cracked and he said , ' Now dammit ! Let 's quit talking about this subject . ' " Smathers did . <P> Who says you ca n't go home again ? Janis Joplin did it last week , and for her special effort won the prize-a flat tire-as the member of the class of ' 60 who had come the farthest for the reunion ( from San Francisco to Port Arthur , Texas ) . Her Thomas Jefferson High School chums were more than a little bit surprised to find that she had n't changed much , except for her feathered , wild , mod clothes . One buddy muttered rather sadly of the let-it-all-hang-out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a real lady because that 's not her image . But she was . " <P> She has served her country in three wars , and plans to leave this fall for her eighth annual tour of duty in Viet Nam . Martha Raye , however , will not be playing her mod-witch part from Bugaloos , a fall TV show , but will serve as a surgical nurse with the Green Berets . The Nightingale role is hardly a new one for Colonel Raye , who has been a sometime practicing nurse ever since 1936 . Twice hit by shrapnel during the Viet Nam years , she bravely classifies her wounds as " not serious . Once in the foot , once in the ribs . I 've had worse hangovers . " <P> Retired Cape Town Dentist Philip Blaiberg lived longer than any other heart-transplant patient , 191 months . But last week his 22-year-old daughter Jill belittled her father 's borrowed time and blasted the operation and Surgeon Christiaan Barnard . " I personally think heart transplants are not worthwhile . I saw my father suffer . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money out of the operation . The resultant publicity , she said , " set my life back by more than two years . "
