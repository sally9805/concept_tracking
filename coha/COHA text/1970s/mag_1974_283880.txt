I HEARD THE OWL CALL MY NAME by MARGARET CRAVEN 166 pages . Doubleday . $4.95 . <P> Engagingly enough , the first new bestselling work of fiction in the U.S. for the new year of 1974 turns out to be a fine , small , odd book set in a Canadian Indian village . It was written more than eight years ago , and considering the delay , one might assume that the manuscript , scribbled by some tribal chieftain , had perhaps moldered under a totem pole until discovered by a nosy anthropologist or Royal Canadian Mountie . Not so . The author is an energetic , white-haired American woman , now 72 , named Margaret Craven . The history of her book , from benign neglect to some national celebrity , offers wry commentary on the ways of commerce and the world of publishing . <P> Nine years ago , dutifully wearing a skirt because she 'd been told that Canadians ca n't stand American women in slacks , Miss Craven journeyed north by small boat from Vancouver into the Queen Charlotte Straits of British @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ended at the top of King-come Inlet , in a village of the Kwakiutl Indians . Kingcome is a place of icy water , deep , fir-trimmed inlets , returning salmon , foraging killer whales , overwhelming beauty and , for the once proud Kwakiutls , overwhelming sadness . Even the young are not sure they can face going " outside " to school and trying to live like white men . But they all know that the old tribal ways are dying . <P> Margaret Craven , a journalist and short-story writer , stayed on for weeks at Kingcome : listening , interviewing , taking notes . Like many another writer in similar circumstances , she resolved that she would get it all down before it was gone forever . What she finally produced was I Heard the Owl Call My Name , a blend of fact and imagination that can better be described as a prose elegy than a novel . <P> Boiled Candlefish . The device that transforms the book into fiction is rude enough . Everything that Margaret Craven swiftly experienced and loved about the Kwakiutls is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He is fatally ill but does not know it , and has been sent to the village by his bishop to " learn enough of life to be ready to die . " Much of Mark 's story is presented as a marvelously compact and compelling semidocumentary . The reader meets the old and the young of the village , learns that much of the tribe 's food is customarily spread with a kind of butter called gleena , made from slow-boiled candlefish , and is convinced that the elders mysteriously know whenever a stranger is coming . The Book of Common Prayer and Indian rituals reinforce each other as Mark helps the Kwakiutls transfer their tribal dead from a dilapidated tree-house burial site to newly hallowed ground .
