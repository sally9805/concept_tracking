It is a crisp December morn in 1472 , and on a stubbled field near the Duke of Gloucester 's castle at Pleshey in Essex , solid ranks of warriors confront each other . Above the castle flies the White Rose of the House of York ; across the field the wind whips the Red Rose banners of Lancaster . A flight of Lancastrian arrows reaches Yorkist ranks and the battle is on . Sweaty long-bowmen in the front lines loose their shafts ; behind them , - dismounted , armored knights prepare themselves . The field is alive with cries of pain and anger and the untidy flow of men . <P> The field is real only in the imaginations of the 15 men-one wearing a peace button-who surround it . In fact , it is a 5-by-8-ft. table covered with carefully scaled fields and forests , and populated by immaculately realistic toy soldiers . The only thing actually flowing is ale . The men are gathered , as is their monthly custom , in a private room over the Ordnance Arms , a pub in London 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ battle of its miniaturized Wars of the Roses . But did the Battle of Pleshey actually occur ? Not bloody likely . <P> " We do n't re-create battles that actually happened , " said Edward Smith , secretary of the society 's London section and a geological researcher by profession . " There 's no fun in that . You already know how it comes out . We want to see if we can do better than Napoleon or Wellington . " In the society 's own Wars of the Roses , Henry VI has already been drowned en route to the Crusades and the old Duke of York ( in reality beheaded in 1460 ) has been crowned Richard III . <P> Toys and Tactics . The men of the Society of Ancients are hardly alone in their obsession . War-gaming is the preoccupation of tens of thousands of mini-generals round the world . About 10,000 of the most active British fans are organized into at least 35 clubs in the United Kingdom . Jack Scruby , a California war-game manufacturer , estimates that there are at least 50,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and adds : " Things are growing all the time . " One club in Fort Wayne , Ind. , meets three or four times a year to stage elaborately prepared battles , which can involve 30,000 to 40,000 soldiers . <P> " All of us are pretty nutty , " acknowledges John Tunstill , publisher of Miniature Warfare and president of the London War Games Society . " Most people think we 're a bunch of old eccentrics pushing toys around , but it 's like chess in a way . " The devotees follow the art in publications like Tun-still 's , sport their own society ties , and patronize specialized stores such as London 's Tradition Shop or The Soldier Shop in Manhattan . Some concentrate on exquisitely detailed toy warriors , others on arcane tactical research .
