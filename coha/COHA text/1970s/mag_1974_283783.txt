TEN YEARS AFTER IVAN DENISOVICH by ZHORES MEDVEDEV 202 pages . Knopf. $6.95 . <P> Last August while Russian Geneticist Zhores Medvedev was working in Britain - with his government 's permis sion - Soviet authorities canceled his passport and revoked his citizenship , making him an involuntary migr . Medvedev , who now lives in London , can not have been surprised . The Soviets had tried to subdue him before , once locking him in an insane asylum for 19 days until worldwide protests embarrassed the government into releasing him . Medvedev 's indignant dissidence ( expressed in The Rise and Fall of T.D . Lysenko and A Question of Madness ) had marked him as a troublesome enemy of partiinost , that spirit of party orthodoxy that so many other Russian intellectuals , such as Pasternak , Daniel and Sinyavski , Sakharov and Solzhenitsyn , have been un able to accommodate . Medvedev 's twin brother Roy , author of a massive anti-Stalinist work called Let History Judge , has also proved difficult . When Zhores Medvedev 's Ten Years After Ivan Denisovich appeared in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was apparently the guarantee of his exile . <P> Now published in the U.S. , Ten Years is a crisp , contemptuous and sometimes sardonic record of Russia 's intellectual life in the decade since Nikita Khrushchev 's temporary thaw allowed Alexander Solzhenitsyn to publish his novel about life in a Stalinist work camp . At first Khrushchev praised One Day , but in March 1963 he told a meeting of party leaders and intellectuals : " Take my word for it , this is a very dangerous theme . It 's a kind of stew that will attract flies like a carcass ; all sorts of bourgeois scum from abroad will come crawling all over it . " <P> Orchestrated Mail . After Khrushchev , the new Soviet leaders took up repression again in a serious way - isolating the rebellious , taking away their jobs , jailing them , sending them to asylums . Lesser-known dissidents were easily silenced . The better known , like Solzhenitsyn , have tried to save themselves with publicity . Yet in May 1972 , says Medvedev , it seemed that the stage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with defaming the Soviet state . Richard Nixon was then on his way to Moscow , however . As Medvedev dryly relates : " An agreement was expected , amongst many others , on cultural and scientific affairs , and reprisals against Solzhenitsyn would not sound quite the right harmonious note . " <P> Medvedev knows his way around the Soviet bureaucracy , and it is in that sort of expertise that his book is most interesting . He understands how campaigns of public opinion are mounted , as when Pravda presented an outpouring of orchestrated " mail " against awarding Solzhenitsyn the Lenin Prize . There is a cold fascination in learning that Glavlit-the machinery of hacks that controls censorship-could overrule even First Secretary Khrushchev about what should be published . More recently , Novelist Mikhail Sholokhov ( Quiet Flows the Don ) had to delete a chapter from a new novel called They Fought for the Motherland at the censors ' insistence because it dealt with prison-camp tortures . In its place , Sholokhov substituted a discussion of fishing techniques .         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
