txt President Gamal Abdel Nasser of the United Arab Republic is pressing the Soviet Union for MIG23 fighter planes and technological aid to intercept the Israeli bombers that have been flying almost at will over , this country , but he is hesitating about asking for Soviet pilots to loin the Middle East war . " This is a delicate question , " he said in an interview at the presidential residence here last night . " I have to think about that , but also I have to say something : If these air raids ! reach the industrial centers , this will not only be the industrial centers of Egypt ; it will also be the industrial centers of Israel . " Against Concessions Mr. Nasser took an unyielding position against making any territorial concessions to Israel , and even dismissed a suggestion of limited cease-fires during Jewish and Moslem religious holidays . When the recorded interview was over , he said that if Wash-1 ington gave more Phantom planes to Israel  --  a question on which President Nixon has promised a decision by early March @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Arab world in less than two years . Mr. Nasser also made the following points : cHe could not accept giving Israel one inch of Arab territory , lie wanted peace but peace meant complete evacuation of the . Israeli-occupied territories , including Jerusalem , a solution of the Palestinian refugee problem , and the creation of a non-fanatic multireligious Israeli state . cAfter that , the recognition of Israel , the right of Israel to exist , the freedom of navigation in the Suez Canal , " then there will be peace . " There will be no need of police forces , no need of demilitarized zones , because if " we solve the refugee problem , and Israel declares about the borders without expansion , there will be a solution . " CHe is sure Israel wants more and more territory , not only everything she conquered in the 1967 war but more in the next generation . CIEs Central Committee has been discussing whether to agree to a partial settlement for the Israeli evacuation of the Sinai : Peninsula without solving the problem of Jerusalem and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agreed about // that . The only border rectifications they had in mind were minor adjustments to accommodate villages that were partly on one side of a border and partly on the other . fan June , 1967 he had no plan for attack on Israel . " We were not capable of attacking Israel at that time , because a big part of our army was in Yemen  --  about three divisions . " The interview , in English , took place in a spare room in the official residence , where President Nasser lived two decades ago when he was a colonel . Though he complained that ' former President Lyndon B. Johnson had tried to dominate him he had a photograph of Mr. Johnson on a small table along with a picture of IStriathe Nkhumah , the former President of Ghana . Mr. Nasser seemed , in good health , despite rumors that : he is a diabetic who has shingles and circulatory disorders . His language was tough , , but his manner quiet and even modest ; and once when the inevitable tape-recorder trouble occurred , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and waited patiently for them to restore the sound . Later he permitted the use of a Government telex circuit to allow an uncensored transcript of his remarks to leave Cairo . His major theme was that he had come to power to bring about the social reconstruction of his country , but that he had been ' diverted from this to the defense of Egypt through the aggressive ambitions of Israel . the faithlessness of the United States and Britain , and- the determination of the Jews to poison the relations between Cairo and Washington . The President was clearly fascinated and frustrated by the military technology available to Israel through the United States , and quietly furious about the prospect of facing more new American Phantoms when , as he conceded , Israel already commanded the air over the Arab world . " You know , ' he said , " when they attack us , for instance , they have electronic jamming against our radar . Then our radar . screens become white . Then before they ' attack , they have electronic reconnaisance . This.gives pinpoint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " We called a Soviet group to study that and to tell about a Solution and they told us about some solutions , but they did n't believe it at the beginning , the Soviets , when we told them that the Israelis had so and so . " President Nasser added that he had not tried to get the newest Soviet fighter plane , the MIG23 , until two months ago , but he conceded that , even if Egypt did get these planes , they would not give him the striking power of the American Phantoms . As the interview went along it became paradoxical and even appeared contradictory . For on the one hand President Nasser was frank about Israel 's superior military equipment technology , and support from the United States , and on the other hand he was openly defiant , not only of Israel but of the United States , and highly sensitive to any suggestion that his country might be backward and ineffective . In giving his views on a settlement of the Arab-Israeli dispute , the President said he thought the problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said , " we want peace . But what is peace to us ? Peace means the complete evacuation of the occupied territory , including Jerusalem , and after that the recognition of Israel , the right of Israel to exist , the freedom of navigation in the Suez Canal . Then there will be peace . " Time and again , he referred to remarks by the Israeli Premier , Mrs. Golda Meir , in an interview with this reporter published in The New York Times last Sunday . It seemed to him to challenge the efficiency and dignity of his country . He challenged all her statements that the Arabs had attacked the Israelis in the past , . and insisted that ' it was the other way around . All Goes ' Against Him The Egyptian people are fighting , he said , for the sake of their rights , for justice , and for the sake of not being humiliated . " You know , there were many ways of humiliation in your interview with Mrs. Meir , " he observed . " You know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , why should we heed him , and many words like that . " " Our people here , really , have their experiences . We have lived here for more than 7,000 years : civilization  --  old Egyptian civilization . It has withstood many invaders , now we are invading the new invaders , the Israelis . So it is our independence , and it is also our dignity . " Everything , he seemed to he saying , had gone against him : his old friends in the West , now helping his enemy . His major aim of bringing about the modernization and social reconstruction of his country had been hampered by the imperatives of defense . But never mind : he would fight on , he would not compromise , and in the end the size and long historical tradition of the Arab peoples would prevail . In private , Western diplomats here , many of them pro-Arab , feel that President Nasser , in his conversations with King Hussein of Jordan and others , has been far less rigid than he was in this interview and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prevent new commitments of planes by President Nixon to the Israelis . In this conversation , however , he conceded nothing . The United States and Israel and Britain were to blame for all the troubles that had beset him since he came to power in his mid-thirties : Now , in his fifties , he was saying that the Nixon Administration 's efforts to introduce an even-handed American policy in the Middle East were " worse " than the Johnson Administration 's eight-point Middle Eastern program of 1968 , that Washington was merely following the policies and desires of Israel , often in official Israeli language , and that the Israeli raid on the sprburbs of Cairo yesterday was not a technical error but a calculated raid to trap and kilt the munitions factory workers between shifts . All this was said with a kind of quiet and even modest inner conviction : There was no honor in the West , nothing but ambition and aggression in Israel . and no help for Egypt except from the Russians , whose allodt Support in the battle he would have to think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
