THE trial had not been going badly for Lieut . William L. Calley Jr . During the first three weeks . Prosecutor Aubrey Daniel easily established that a massacre of unarmed , docile South Vietnamese had indeed taken place at My Lai . But Daniel complained of being " particularly handicapped " now , nearly 33 months after the fact , in proving Calley guilty of murdering anyone , let alone the 102 victims cited in the indictment . Most of the witnesses were vague and inconclusive as to who had issued the orders and squeezed the triggers . One of Daniel 's most important witnesses , Paul David Meadlo , refused to testify at all . <P> Then Witness No. 31 at the Fort Benning court-martial altered the trial 's course in a full clay of dramatic testimony last week . Dennis Conti , 21 , a private first class in Calley 's platoon and now a truck driver in Providence , told how he and Meadlo held a group of 30 to 40 villagers-most of them women and children-on a trail in My Lai at Calley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and said : " ' I thought I told you to take care of these people . ' I said ' We are . We 're guarding them . ' Calley said , ' No , kill them . ' He said to come around to this side , get on line and fire into them . I told him I would guard a tree line , with my grenade launcher , while they fired . " <P> Steady Stare . What happened next ? asked Daniel . " Calley and Meadlo got on line and fired directly into the people . " What were the people doing ? " They screamed and yelled . Some tried to get up . There were lots of heads and pieces of heads shot off , and flesh flew off the sides and arms and legs . " Meadlo , Conti related , was weeping . He tried to give his rifle to Conti . " I told him I could n't , " the witness continued . " Let Lieut . Calley kill them . . . Some kids were still standing and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A second and much larger group of Vietnamese died in an irrigation ditch on the east side of My Lai . Conti approached , he said , and saw " Lieut . Calley and Sergeant David Mitchell standing on a dike , firing . . . There were people in the ditch and Calley and Mitchell were firing into it ... I saw one woman try to get up . I saw Lieut . Calley fire and blow the side of her head off . So I left . " <P> Well spoken , unemotional , direct in manner . Conti seemed to be an effective witness for the prosecution . When Calley stared at him , he stared back steadily . When one of the defense attorneys , Richard Kay , shouted at him , trying to establish that Conti had been a heavy user of marijuana while in Viet Nam , he coolly denied it . Conti did admit when pressed that at the time of the My Lai operation he was being treated for a venereal disease .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
