THE CULTURAL CONTRADICTIONS OF CAPITALISM <P> by DANIEL BELL <P> 301 pages . Basic Books . $12.95 . <P> <P> The more that Sociologist Daniel Bell peers into the future , the more he seems to respect the past . It would be hard to find anyone more at home in such a variety of contemporary disciplines-economics , politics , the arts , popular culture . Yet Bell is not happy with the trends in any of them . Something precious has gone out of life , he feels . The deficiency makes people harsher , more inward , more aggrandizing . Bell yearns for a restoration of civitas : " The spontaneous willingness to obey the law , to respect the rights of others , to forgo the temptations of private enrichment at the expense of the public weal-in short , to honor the ' city ' of which one is a member . " <P> Bell is no mere nostalgia peddler sighing for antique worlds . With acerbic but civil scholarship , he blames today 's honorless condition on what he calls " modernism " : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 19th century and has gathered momentum ever since . Modernism rejects the old , the traditional , the bourgeois in favor of the new , the sensational , the revolutionary . As such , it has dissolved many conventions , and discredited most institutions and values . Today , says Bell , its victory is complete . There is a perpetual , unwholesome rage for the new . Instead of affirming a " moral-philosophical tradition against which the new could be measured , " contemporary culture has an " unprecedented mission : an official , ceaseless search for a new sensibility . " <P> Under these conditions , an avant-garde can hardly be said to exist . The most outrageous or destructive idea or art form becomes accepted overnight . " In fact , " writes Bell , the chief characteristic of the Establishment " is its eagerness to repudiate its own existence . " The condition of art is echoed in politics and the economy . Capitalists have lost faith in their enterprise and are listless about defending it . Capitalism 's very success has created a paradox : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But the goods it abundantly produces encourage a mindless pursuit of hedonism . Capitalism is thus deprived of any " moral or transcendent ethic . " There is a further paradox . The greater the economic growth under capitalism , the higher the expectations . People demand more government services and more protection against adversity . Inflation results , savings diminish , and capitalism is undermined . The only solution is a restraint on private appetite and a return to a public philosophy-a tall order , as Bell acknowledges , in these roiled times . <P> Bell is skeptical about his fellow citizens , who , he feels , are ensnared by modernism . The once open American society is growing more rigid and confining . With few values and convictions to restrain them , people increasingly elbow one another aside as they push their rights and privileges to an extreme . Conveying an almost physical repugnance at this gathering chaos , Bell warns of the " megalomania of self-infinitization. "
