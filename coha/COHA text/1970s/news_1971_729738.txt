txt A highly publicized case in which 16 men allegedly linked to the right-wing paramilitary Minutemen were seized and indicted five years ago has been dropped with the last remaining charges dismissed . The case broke into the open with police roundups across the state on Oct. 30 , 1966 , when charges were made that three Minutemen teams planned to place fire bombs at three camps that they considered to be leftist oriented . Tons of weapons were assertedly seized in the roundup , with Nat H. Hentel , then District Attorney of Queens and now a Supreme Court Justice , reporting the seizure of 125 rifles , 10 pipe bombs , five mortars , a dozen machine guns , a bazooka , three grenade launchers and j a million rounds of ammunition of all kinds . Yesterday , Chief Assistant District Attorney Frederick J. Ludwig of Queens said the case " went down the drain " as court decisions held that the original search warrants had been defective . Mr. Ludwig said that last Thursday he moved to dismiss the remaining counts against the last ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asln recognition of the lack of a speedy trial . The weapons and ammunition seized , he , sald , had stayed in the custody of the Police Department 's , property clerk , and " he 'll destroy them " ' instead of returning them . The Minutemen organization started in 1959 ' ostensibly to recruit members who would be prepared to fight back in case of a Communist takeover cf the United States Government . Its leader , Robert DePugh , was sentenced last . October ' in Federal Court in Albuquerque , /Ni . M. , to 10 years In prmon for violating Federal firearms regulations . In the 1966 roundup , defense counsel had contended that some of those arrested were only gun collectors or that they disclaimed active connections with the Minutemen or'any violent intentions . Mr. Ludwig said yesterday he was convinced there had been a Minutemen conspiracy at the time of the . roundup , but on the present situation , he would say only : " This office is , vigilant to observe conspiracies that involve the use of unlawfully possessed weapons , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The use of weapons to achieve objectives even that might be socially desirable is frowned on by the District Attorney . Politicizing crime is no defense . " Court Ruling Cited Mr. Ludwig said there had been orders by Supreme Court Justice . Peter T. Farrell on June 24 and ' 25 , 1968 , holding the original search warrants defective because of insufficient affidavits , so that the evidence seized would have ' to be suppressed . On June 8 , 1970 , the Appellate Division in Brooklyn ' upheld ' the orders by a four-toone decision . It said the affidavits had been . sworn to by a ' detective in the District ' Attorney 's office who did not indicate " who the informant was or in what way the information was reliable . " Although the detective later testified in reports that eventually he read that the jnformation had come from policemen acting as undercover men , the Appellate Division said " the affidavits were defective on their face under the test " set forth by a 1964 United States Supreme Court decision . That decision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disclosure of an informant 's name , but did require ' establishing the basis for his reliability , Mr. Ludwig said . The decisions , . Mr. Ludwig said , meant , that 14 of 16 counts in the original indictments had to be eliminated , involving felony charges of possession of dangerous weapons and explosives . They meant that all but seven men had to be freed , he said , leaving seven defendants accused only of two counts of conspiracy to commit arson in the third degree and to endanger life by maliciously. placing explosives near buildings  --  both misdemeanors . The , final motion , to drop ' all charges , Mr. Ludwig said , was also Made in recognition of a 1966 ' United States , Supreme Court decision ? Xlepfer , vs . North Carolina ? holding that ' the constitutional guarantee ? of a speedy trial " under the , Sixth Amendment applied to states as well as the . Federal . Government .
