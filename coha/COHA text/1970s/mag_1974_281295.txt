McQ presents John Wayne in civvies , which seems a little like dressing Gary Grant in bib overalls . The Duke messes around casually with playing the title character , a Seattle cop who quits the force to press a vigorous one-man investigation of his partner 's death . His searches lead to discoveries of gangsterism in the import business , corruption in high places , lax moral standards in corporations and other illuminations that come as more of a surprise to Wayne than anyone else . <P> The action sequences are frequent but arthritic . Colleen Dewhurst - whom one hardly expects to find in such company-provides an agreeable cameo as a roundheeled cocktail waitress with a taste for cocaine . The Duke remains amiable and unruffled throughout , but it is a bit troubling to see him poaching so obviously on Clint Eastwood 's loner-cop territory . <P> As for Eastwood himself , he makes a halfhearted attempt , in MAGNUM FORCE , to clean up Dirty Harry , that law-and-order fascist manqu whom you hated to hate a couple of seasons back . Once again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Detective Harry Callahan ( Eastwood ) is confronted by a series of apparently motiveless , definitely psychopathic murders . This time , it turns out , they are not the work of an isolated madman but of a self-appointed death squad , members of Harry 's own San Francisco police department who have grown impatient with the delays and niceties of the rule of law . This gives Harry an opportunity to pull the old switcheroo . Unlikely as it seems , he announces that for all his notorious individualism he believes in working for change through the system . <P> This liberal-mindedness on the part of the film makers seems more opportunistic than deeply felt-an attempt , perhaps , to still political criticism of the earlier film . But what really spoils the formula is a thin and meandering script by John Milius and listless direction by Ted Post , whose work can not stand even glancing comparison with Don Siegel 's authoritative handling of Dirty Harry . The film climaxes , as all policiers apparently must , with a car chase , but it is nowhere near as interesting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavy . He is the only one present who seems genuinely interested in What 's going on . <P> THE FIGHTERS concerns the first Muhammad Ali-Joe Frazier bout in March 1971 and shows every moment of every round , recorded by a battery of cameras stationed all over Madison Square Garden . With only this fight footage , meticulously edited , Director William Greaves would have had a fine sports film . What lifts The Fighters out of the special-interest category is the first hour of documentary on the preparations for the match . The fighters , the promoters , the managers , the hangers-on , all speak a kind of spiked Odets chatter that makes the movie look and sound like a cinma vrit replay of Body and Soul . Greaves has a quick eye and an obvious affection for the more flamboyant personalities behind the sport . A reporter at a swanky press reception rather tentatively badgers Promoter Jack Kent Cooke about the high cost of fight tickets . " Well , I 'd like everyone to drive a Cadillac , like everybody to be employed , get a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " But , " he adds with ill-disguised glee , " it just is n't that kind of world .
