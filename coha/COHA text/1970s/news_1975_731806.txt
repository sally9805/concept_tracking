txt MAYORAL candidate Edward Morahan tried to do a little wading in the Old Mall 's river Wednesday afternoon , and got his toes frozen . The scene W4IS a senior citizens ' rally in Arie Crown Theater , and quite a rally it was for the 3,000 elderly Chicagoans transported in 90 CTA buses from the city 's nutrition centers . The sing-a-long was accompanied by Franz Bentley 's society orchestra , and the guest speaker was none other than the city 's foremost oldster , Richard J. Daley , who turns 73 in May . Bur ALTHO Daley rhapsodized about the virtues of electing elder statesmen to office , the affair was billed as " nontiollitcal , " and taxpayers paid for Arie Crown , the buses , and Denier . Daley came free . ' Hanrahan , one of three Daley challengers in Tuesday 's Democratic primary , figured the taxpayers would n't mind if he poked his . head in . For his trouble , he was threatened with arrest , bluntly refused permission to sit alongside Daley on stage , and kept tabs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this went on while Daley workers freely handed out political literature , seniors were given giant Daley posters to carry , and the aged audience was coached to sing , to the tune of " Honey , " a ditty that , went " Loved you from the start , Daley , bless your little heart , Daley . " IT MOVED Hanrahan to grumble : " Is this the guy who said you should keep politics . out of the schools ? I guess it 's okay at the other end of the spectrum . " Hanrahan 's encounter with Poligrip politics began when he tried handing out his own literature in the lobby at McCormick Place as the senior citizens filed in . Several police approached and warned they would arrest him if he persisted . Hanrahan 's brother , Dick , protested that Daley literature was being distributed . He was told , " We had no complaint about that , only against you , " It was agreed finally that I the foinner state 's attorney could shake hands with the oldsters , who for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policeman appeared and apologized , saying , " I was just doing what I was told . " LATER , DICK Hanrahan sought to find out if , while it was inappropriate for his brother to speak , perhaps he could sit onstage alongside the mayor . A white-thatched man who identified himself as Joseph Celig , organization director of the Council of Senior Citizens Organizations , reacted as if Dick had suggested the audience be forced ' to dance all night long . " What do you want from us ? " he demanded hotly . " We did n't invite you . We 're running this affair , and we invite who we want . We invited Mayor Daley . He is a member , an honorary member . Ile 's one of us. " " 110W CAN you get away with calling this , nonpolitcal ? " fumed candidate Hanrahan . " It 's so brazen-it is n't funny . I wonder who 's paying for it . I do n't see how it can be done , if It is n't an open meeting . Down on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' chest sashes , added a touch of the Austro-Hithgarian empire to such ' old favorites as " My Wild Irish Rose . " Robert Ahrens , director of the Mayor 's Office for Senior Citizens , was informing the audience about recent and planned city programs for the elderly , when Daley walked in . Ahrens said , " Ladles and gentlemen , we practiced our song , now let 's sing it . " " Loved you from the start , Daley , " the crowd sang . DALEY WAS introduced by Ronald Nordheimer , who said the Daley machine " generates power and gets things done , while the Singer machine op , erates only on a spool ' of thread . " Daley talked at length about the virtues of growing old , and how older people should be allowed to continue ' to work . " Actually , " he said , " many older persons are superior to younger persons in their ability to hold a job and work . " He named Albert Einstein , " who helped fashion our world , " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " And he said many people work right into their eighties and nineties , sparking someone to say , " Is that a tip-off ? " Finally , Daley told of former Gov . Olson of Wisconsin , who was asked how he could run for reelection at age 75 . Olson responded that while , he could n't run as fast as he used to , " you do n't think with your feet . " This is n't political at all , " murmured Dick Hanrahan . " Unh , unh , " murmured Ed Hanrahan.
