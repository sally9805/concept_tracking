txt By Jeff Lyon PRECINCT CAPTAIN No. had everything to be the perfect precinct captain  --  rotundity , bonhommie , and loyalty . Now that sense of loyalty was pulling him apart . " Eddie , I was always with you , always , " he said somewhat sadly , tightly clasping mayoral candidate Edward Hanrahan 's hand amid the 10th Ward Lions Club revelers . " But against Daley I got ta be with Daley . I got ta . I 'm obliged , you might say . " Precinct captain No. 2 , also rotund , also bonhornous , but the loyalty tipping slightly ; " Ed , you know who I have to look like I 'm pushing . But we 're putting in the word for you , too , " The words were whispered thru the smoky , polka night din at a 7th Ward rally for aldermanic candidate Bob Wilinskl . EDWARD HANRAHAN Is betting there are more like No. 2 than No , 1 as he heads into the stretch of his longshot race for mayor . He is counting on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once so close to as state 's attorney and party stalwart . lie has tried to get across the unspoken message that should they decide that Daley 's too old , too autocratic , too insensitive , they can turn to Hanrahan without ' fear of a massive overhaul of good old Chicago politics . To those with a real stake in the system , he seems subliminally to offer himself as continuity rather than the cathartic of Ald. William Singer . ONE OF THE pitfalls of such strategy is that it is im // Hanrahan looks for ' turncoat ' vote // possible for him to gauge how he is doing . No one 's going to say , not with Daley 's awesome coattails spread over the city . But Hanrahan forges on , attending wakes , and ward rallies , and holding tete-a-tetes with old friends from the city 's satraps . It is , of course , not his only strategy . He has tried , with limited success , to broaden his appeal . Stressing the need for racial harmony , he has been received politely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a man associated with the 1969 Black Panther raid , there are moments like the one at State and Washington Streets Tuesday night . While mailing a letter , Hanrahan 's arm was touched by a black woman who fnsiated on some campaign literature and enthusiastically promised her vote . IF HE GETS an appreciable black vote , it will be because he is associated as well with a tough stance on crime  --  more a problem in black neighborhoods than anywhere else in Chicago . He also is counting on some Republican crossovers in the Feb. 25 Democratic primary . It was a strategy that worked in 1972 , when he sought reelection as state 's attorney in a primary field including ma chine candidate Raymond Berg and liberal Donald Page Moore . But the basic hope has to be to loosen Daley 's grip on regular Democrats and cUt into his vote . This would seem to work more in Singer 's favor , but Hanarahan will not acknowledge that .

Edward Vrdolyak sheepishly greeted Hanrahan at a club meeting in the 10th Ward recently , and after huddling with . him for a few minutes , told newsmen they had been " talking over old times . " Whom did he support ? " I 'm with the mayor . " It is a phrase Hanrahan has heard many times , and will hear more of in days to come . But it is n't stopping him .
