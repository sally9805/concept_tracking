To the Editors : The Essay " Fair Trials and the Free Press " Oct. 28 raises the very valid question of how to deal with choosing and managing a jury in a trial involving prominent figures or those made conspicuous by events . <P> Prospective jurors are not all TIME readers . Many lack the background or education necessary to understand that the influences to which they have been subjected in everyday life and their longstanding prejudices must be cast aside , and that only the evidence presented in the courtroom and the law as given by the judge to apply to their evidence analysis will be the clay from which their verdict is molded . Sequestration is a poor solution . It makes service on the jury a form of imprisonment and reduces the pool of available qualified jurors . <P> Press restraint is almost a contradiction in terms . So it is up to the judiciary . The judge must be a modern legal entrepreneur who can manage the business of a fair trial by persuading jurors to be objective , eliminating those who can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forces that could cause a tilt . Theodore R. Kupferman , Associate , Supreme Court Appellate Division , New York City <P> As one who participated as a defense attorney in two of the four cases you mentioned ( Dr. Sam Sheppard and My Lai Four-Captain Ernest Medina ) , I have vivid memories of the dynamics of those trials and the publicity difficulties that had to be overcome . <P> The first Sheppard trial was a shambles and infected by the worst kind of yellow journalism . But in voiding Sheppard 's conviction the U.S. Supreme Court laid the blame exactly where it belonged-at the feet of an insensitive trial judge who had failed to take even the most basic steps to protect his jury . Not to be overlooked , however , is the second Sheppard trial held in that same " poisoned " city , Cleveland , where a determined trial judge produced an obviously fair proceeding . Although I agree with Judge Elliot 's reversal of the Calley conviction on other grounds , I can not believe that pretrial publicity was a factor in the original verdict @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ courts and the press have been overreacting to the Sheppard decision since it came down in 1966 . I have seen trial judges issue gag orders when they , because of their own harsh conduct , have been the chief beneficiaries . I have seen seasoned journalists cower in the face of oppressive orders and then insist on their right to print a defendant 's criminal record the night before jury selection begins . <P> A degree of professional understanding among the bench , bar and press would solve all but the knottiest problems . Where conflicts can not be resolved , I say let the press have its head . If we do our best to provide a fair trial and fail , we can always have a retrial or dismiss the case . F. Lee Bailey Boston <P> The balance between a fair trial and a free press has swung away from the right of the press to report the news to a concerned public . A distinction has to be made between disinterested and uninterested persons in selecting jurors . Our juries were meant to be composed of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who do not care to find out what is happening in the world around them . Buz Swerkstrom Atlas , Wis . <P> Housing Woes
