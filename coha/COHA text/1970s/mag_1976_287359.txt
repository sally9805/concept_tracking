Servants of the czars used roe of lesser quality to polish up the royal shoe leather , while their masters downed the finer grades with vodka . Today Russian caviar commands princely prices in leading restaurants ( up to $20 an ounce ) and graces gourmet tables the world over-though rarely in the Soviet Union . Because of Moscow 's need for hard currency , most of the 96 tons of gray-black sturgeons ' eggs it produces annually are exported , bringing $5.9 million annually to the Kremlin 's coffers but leaving little chance for the ordinary Russian to enjoy his national delicacy . <P> Until now , that is . Attacking this problem of economics and national pride with chemistry , researchers at the Soviet Academy of Sciences have found a way to make a caviar substitute out of milk , and the Ministry of Fisheries has opened a pilot production line in Moscow to try it out . Located in a corner of a large fish processing plant on the banks of the Moscow Canal , the line is a 60-ft. stretch of stainless-steel tanks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belt that delivers small jars labeled CAVIAR-PROTEIN-FRESH . Although the facility turns out only 440 lbs . a day , bigger plants are on the drawing boards . <P> Soviet scientists had been trying to find a suitably cheap , protein-based caviar substitute for more than a decade . Most sturgeons-huge fish that can weigh more than 1,000 lbs. - are caught in the Caspian Sea . But as a result of a drop in water level and rising industrial pollution at the Russian end of the sea , the Soviet sturgeon catch has been dwindling , while Iran 's production has remained steady . After experimenting with other possible bases for a caviar substitute , the Russian chemists settled on casein , a protein found in curdled milk . Explains Chemist Vladimir Tolstogouzov : " Soybean protein is cheaper , but casein is best for making this exquisite product . " <P> The Russians first mix the casein with gelatin to produce a kind of porridge . This is poured into a steel centrifuge and mechanically agitated until the mixture emerges as a mound of little white pellets . The pellets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authentic taste ) , bathed with tannin extracted from tea leaves and stems ( for color ) and finally given a salty bath ( the same preservative used on natural caviar ) . <P> Connoisseurs find the product slightly mushy , even when consumed with vodka . But at $5.90 a lb. , compared with $24.50 for the real thing , there has been nothing soft about initial sales of the fake caviar . At the Okean ( Ocean ) fish store on Moscow 's Prospekt Mira , where the pilot plant 's output is sold , every scrap of the entire daily production sells out in only two hours .
