txt " WELL . CHAPS , should n't we be going ? " Hilt said , champing at the bit . He was an hour away from seeing his first major-league baseball game In person , and there are few occasions in life more sacred than that . " Relax and have another slice of pizza " John said , grating the spatula against the bottom of the pan and conveying a sliding , slipping mass of cheese , sausage , and mushroom onto Hilt 's plate , Elastic strands of pizza goo trailed behind , leavings that John , grabbing like a deekhand , quickly hauled in and ate . Outside it was raining quite heavily Close-up With Jeff Lyon indeed . Denny was miserable . He held his face down over his salad bowl . " You guys are nuts , " he said over and over . Denny has a thick beard and spectacles , which give him the appearance of a Viennese psychiatrist , so what he said had the ring of truth . " YOU BABY , " John snorted . Peter spoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could get there and after just one pitch the ump could call the game . " " Yeah , then where 'd we be ? " Denny bleated . " At 35th and Shields in the rain , that 's where ! " " Can it , " John barked , " Hilt 's never seen a ballgame , okay ? We 're his pals and we 're taking him , all right ? " RAJNHATS RELUCTANTLY donned , they muddled off to the " L. " Of them all , Hilt Is the only South Sider . He lives In a high-crime neighborhood , which has sown in him not a mere seed of paranoia but a mighty forest . " The trains seem higher off the ground here than on the North Side , " Peter said , looking out at the wet tire yards . " That 's because the muggers can jump higher here , " Hilt said . lie is always saying Archie Bunker things like that . THEY GOT OFF at 35th Street and began making their way to White Sox Park , Hilt nervously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the street and counting cops at intersections . " Gee , we could have taken the Dan Ryan ' L , ' " he said . " It 's closer . " " Oh God , " John said to himself . They settled into upper-deck box seals . The . rain had slackened . A middleaged woman , looking very matronly , was ' playing the ' organ ' nearby . " Is that Nancy Faust ? " Hilt asked . " I thought she was supposed to be a real something . " " She has aged h the job , I guess . It 's been a long season , " Peter said , The matronly woman finished a patriotic number with a flourish , and then stood // It 's beginner 's luck for novice Sox fan // to let a slim , attractive blond take over . " That 's Nancy Faust , " John told Mill , who looked on , instantly in love . SOMEONE offered Milt a taco , hoping to distract him from mooning crazily at Nancy Faust lest the security gorillas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Huh ? " Milt saki , slamming his open jaws shut . He declined the taco , explaining that besides ? the evening 's pizza he 'd had a giampietro for lunch . A giampietro is an enormous , spicy submarine sandwich from Giampietro 's on Grand Avenue , a place Milt swears by . The White Sox now took the field , which was as soggy as used croutons . " BUM ! " screamed Denny at the top of his considerable lungs . " B000000 , you bum . You stink . " These insights were offered to Alan Bannister , the Sox shortstop , who fields baseballs as though he 's chasing greased pigs and whom Denny vindictively blames for the White Sox collapse . The game began . It was to be long and tedious . Batters kept ' demanding that the ground crew sprinkle sand in the batter 's box for footing . Pitchers kept digging mud from their spikes with a tongue depressor between pitches . Umpires fell into slumber . " Is it always like this ? " Milt asked . " No , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said it that he lied . NOW THE MINNESOTA Twins were at bat . There came to the plate a Twins player named Roy Smalley , and this was an occasion for delight because Smalley 's father was with the Chicago Cubs years ago , when they were first becoming a great dynasty of failure ? and was , if possible , a worse shortstop than Alan Bannister . " Your father was a bum ! " screamed Denny . Milton 's attention wandered frequently to Nancy Faust . Every time he glanced away from her to the diamond , he seemed to stifle a yawn . He declined a hot dog , peanuts , and some beer , and seemed to be fading fast until some loudmouthed kids in cutoffs walked past and yelled , " Hey , Harreeeeee , " up at the press booth , which is do riguer behavior at Comiskey Park . Milt sat upright . " Is that Harry Caray ? " he blurted with excitement . He strained for a look inside the press booth . THE SONOGRAM announced that Wednesday would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grew thoughtful . " Why do n't they have Albanian night ? " he asked . Denny is Albanian . Close-up " You know , " Denny said to Peter , " I doubt if I 'd get the chance to ask him , but someone told me Harry Caray 's Albanian . " Talk to Van Huesca , " someone said . " IS HE ALBANIAN ? Sounds Dutch , " Denny said . " No , he knows Harry Carey . " The game went on and on . John produced a tiny radio and pressed it to his ear . " Is there a place downstairs to buw batteries ? " he asked . " This thing 's really weak . " His face suddenly contorted , and he swung his head around in pain , as if a secret spy agency had triggered an unseen explosion inside his head . " Cubs lose , " he moaned . Milton was suffering . The Sox had mounted a surge , and the crowd was singing " Na , Na Na Na , Na Na Na Na , Hay-yay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's armies , but Milt was unmoved . He looked at Peter . His lips moved silently . They said " I 'm bored . " SUDDENLY , THERE was a crack of the bat and a white sphere , foul , most foul , came hurtling up at them . They stood to catch it , all except Milt , who did n't know about these things . Closer it came until it crossed over the guardrail and hit with a huge smack in Milt 's midsection . He sagged . John and Peter threw themselves at him . " You hurt ? " they cried . Denny was even faster . He elbowed past John to dig behind the seats . Ile groped and groped , and then he said " Aha ! " His hand emerged with a Rawlings baseball , which he stuck in his pocket . " Hey Milt , you hurt ? " he said , turning . MILT SMILED wanly , straightening up slowly . ' Uh-uh , " he said . " Got me in the . . . oos000 . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " I 've been going to ballgames a lifetime and never got near a four ball , and he comes out once and gets hit by one . " When the game was over they all went home ; In his apartment Milt thought about the evening and the game called baseball , and he wondered why people thought it was fun . You walk through bad neighborhoods to get there , he thought , and you have to sit there for four hours watching men scrape their shoes , and you get hit in the stomach . He wondered about it for a little while longer , then turned out the light .
