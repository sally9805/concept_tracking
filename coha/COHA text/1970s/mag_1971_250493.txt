The crisply uniformed U.S. Army lieutenant colonel was briefing a group of foreign military attaches in Saigon . " As of today no ARVN elements remain in Laos , " he began . " Enemy forces are now chasing them toward the border-wait , I do n't mean to use that word . They are following them to the border . " <P> Not even the usually polished briefers could put a completely bright face on Lam Son 719 's clouded conclusion . Only hours after the latest Washington assurances that all was continuing " according to plan , " the South Vietnamese began streaming back-on foot , aboard armored columns repeatedly raked by enemy fire , and by helicopter from shell-scarred hilltop fire bases deep in Laos . The last group out , the 2,000-man 1st Marine Brigade , barely made it . After clinging to positions on fire bases Delta and Hotel until they could no longer hold off the waves of North Vietnamese attackers , the Marines abandoned their artillery and their dead and headed for the border six miles away . When they crossed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were left . <P> Taking It Apart . Operation Lam Son 719 was suddenly over , 45 days after it had begun . But the withdrawal-and the Communist pursuit-had a momentum of its own . North Vietnamese tankers drove to within half a mile of the border , not only in their own Sovietbuilt machines but in some of the 30 or more American-made M41 tanks abandoned by ARVN in Laos . East of the border at Khe Sanh , the former U.S. Marine outpost from which most of Lam Son 's 600 helicopters operated , enemy rocket and artillery fire thudded in round the clock ; one night last week 40 Communist sappers slipped past the perimeter wire and destroyed or damaged five choppers . At week 's end G.I.s were dismantling everything that they had put together at the start of the operation , right down to the aluminum planked runway . <P> North of Khe Sanh , some 20,000 Communist troops were poised above the Demilitarized Zone , while inside the DMZ the Communists massed a formidable array of tanks , mortar batteries , rockets , antiaircraft guns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buildup-biggest in the DMZ since the 1968 bombing halt-might have been a reaction to allied hints that an invasion of North Viet Nam might be attempted if Lam Son were to turn sour . But some U.S. officers , fearful that it foreshadowed a period of relentless Communist shelling and possibly a fullblown invasion , rushed 7,000 additional American troops to the area . At week 's end there were 20,000 ARVN and 15,000 U.S. troops just below the DMZ . <P> <P> Numbing Losses . Only three days before the final pullout from Laos began , Secretary of State William Rogers told reporters that Lam Son would continue well into April , and perhaps until the start of the rainy season around May 1 . After the assault on Tchepone , it was expected that Lam Son 's troops would exercise an " option " to drive to a key junction ten miles to the southeast . There they were to have sliced up Route 914 , an important and still intact trail route ; disrupted Base Area 611 , a key enemy supply depot ; and swept home via @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What happened ?
