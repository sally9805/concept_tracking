A TIME survey shows doubts about Carter 's ability but faith in his idealism <P> Jimmy Carter likes to tell the story about a drunk hauled into a Georgia court , accused of starting a hotel fire while smoking in bed . He admits being drunk but denies igniting the blaze . " Your honor , " he tells the judge , " the bed was already on fire when I got in it . " <P> That Georgia thigh-slapper provides the President with a metaphor to explain the trouble he has faced for almost a year . When he took office , his desk was piled high with work undone , needs neglected , problems postponed . Such urgent tasks as creating an energy policy , stopping the drain of Social Security funds and reforming the tax and welfare systems had been ignored or put off , largely because nobody had solutions that seemed workable or politically feasible . Like a quarterback who prefers the long bomb to the drudgery of three yards and a cloud of dust , the President threw a lot of comprehensive programs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leadership inadequate , his grasp of the politics shaky . But unquestionably Carter has made gains along with his celebrated setbacks . <P> Congress recessed last week for a month-long holiday without enacting his energy bill , and Carter called that the " only major failure " of his legislative program in 1977 . But he had reason to believe , as he told his press conference , that Congress would complete action " early next year . " Indeed , Senate and House conferees were coming closer to compromise . While Carter certainly would not get all he wants , and industry would not get all it wants either in terms of incentives , he had set the nation on the path toward sensible conservation and development of energy . <P> Meanwhile , the Congress agreed to legislation that would restore financial stability to the Social Security system-at the cost of a huge payroll tax increase ( see following story ) . Partly to make up for it , the President said that next year " we 'll have a major income tax reduction for both business and individuals " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Though he has abandoned his idea of eliminating tax benefits for capital gains , at least in 1978 , businessmen remained uncertain and apprehensive about what tax reform might bring . Through word and deed , Carter has also antagonized many other key voting groups . Farmers were disturbed because he had proposed lower price supports than a more generous Congress decided they merited . ( At his press conference Carter expressed sympathy for the plight of many farmers but said that he would not have participated in their strike if he were still working the land in Sumpter County , Ga . ) Labor was miffed because he did not put up protectionist walls against imports , and wanted him to endorse a larger increase in the minimum wage . Many women were antagonized by his opposition to federally paid abortions for the poor . Blacks and big-city mayors were upset that he did not call for more big-spending programs for federal jobs and urban revival .
