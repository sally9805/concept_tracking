Scott Christianson presented the subject of suicide in prison " In Prison : Contagion of Suicide , " The Nation , Sept. 21 , in a manner well calculated to stir the conscience of the people . Fundamentally , suicide is the rejection of love somewhere within the structure of human interactions ; apathy is the food upon which it feeds . Four , days ago , just a few cells down from mine , a man hung himself . When the facts were investigated , it was discOvered that the parole board had taken away a work release granted him a few weeks previous , with no apparent explanation as to why . This'man was currently fighting to keep his children , whom his former wife wanted taken from him . He lost that battle too . Even though this man 's life style was to stiffer in silence , there were many outward signs of depression ignored by the institutional staff . It is not only a pity but a great tragedy . Our next issue will feature an article on suicide with the hope that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A. Kampa , Associate Editor The Prison Mirror Bronowski 's ? values Miami , Fla . J. Bronowski , noble , kind , brilliant , and a thinker of immense unifying prowess , should not have been eulogized by quoting him on violence see editorial , The Nation , Sept. 7 . To leave the impression that he , like so many today , simply mouthed the platitude that we are a violent i people and that violence is a healthy and good thing is to do him an injustice . His , most important work is Science and Human Values ; why not have quoted the following : " . . . the practice of science compels the practitioner to form for himself a fundamental set of universal val-ues " 9 Bronowski 's major contribution , besides demonstrating the dignity of the unified life , was the philosophical link between the values of science and those of the democratic life . In this he stands with John Dewey , Bertrand Russell , Alfred Whitehead , Michael Polanyi , Isaiah Berlin and Paul Weiss as one of ' the major theorists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the altruistic values of scientific and humanistic endeavors . Thorne Shipley civil rights and church schools Silver Spring , Md . Theodore Hesburgh commendably speaks out for civil rights " Civil Rights : Old Victories , New Battles , " The Nation , Sept. 14 . Yet , on other occasions , ' as at the recent Associated Church Press Convention , he has advocated that all citizens be taxed tcy support parochial schools , which segregate children by creed and which serve so few black children proportionately that they contribute heavily to urban public school racial imbalance ( as . Hesburgh 's U.S. Commission on Civil Rights pointed out only a few years ago ) . Do I detect , a faint odor of hypocrisy ? Carl ' Hersh Hofstadter in his generation Washington , D C. In the absence , so far , of comment by scholars more emi-nent than I , or by those who knew Richard Hofstadter per-sonally , I feel compelled to criticize Anthony GronoWicz 's condescending retrospective on The American Political Tra- President keenly anticipated Ford 's master since plan the economic for " whipping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but his specific proposals are ' not the point of immediate interest . Stiffice it to say that the President 's proposals are neither bold nor surprising ; instead of presenting a " grand design " he has offered a small program of modest conception . As Edwin L. Dale , Jr . comments in The New York Times , " Shuffling $5 billion around in this huge economy can not , by itself , have a , major impact . " The specific , proposals are actually of less importance than the tone of the message . Flat and pedestrian , it was larded with pep-talk phrases about putting shoulders to the wheel , packing a punch , pitching in , and joining in a grand rally designed to ' " whip inflation now " by a process of incantation and ballyhoo . That the American people should be addressed by ; their President  --  even one they did not elect  --  in such a tone on an issue of such importance is itself a cause for concern . The President it is said  --  and it will be repeated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " In , politics , this phrase belongs in the wistful category of " it might have been , " mildly touching but pointless . He is also " sincere , " but as the West Coast journalist Morrow . Mayo once said , sincerity like virtue is one of the arts . And just ' how sincere is he ? Appearance , tone and manner support the impression that he is direct , candid , forthcoming , a man who " levels " with people . He may be that kind of person but he manages to ' talk and act like a conventional politician . For example , he commends his own courage , in the manner of Richard Nixon , by saying that he would not play politics with the issue of inflation . But not only is the message political  --  a mixed bag of committee-dictated compromises-=but the timing and mode of presentation are also emphatically political . To be sure , the President 's hand was forced , to some extent ; he had to propose a program and he could not wait any longer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ S per cent surtax  --  would provoke a storm of protest in the Congress with an election ? only weeks away . Neither Democrats nor Republicans show muck , enthusiasm for biting this bullet . So he proposed a measure , . knowing the Congress would not act on it before the election and probably not at all this year . Was the purpose , then , merely to pass the buck to the Democratically controlled Congress , even at the expense of handicapping GOP candidates ? It took no , courage to propose this " grand design , " made up of compromises calculated to cause minimal distress to the economically most powerful element of the President 's constituency . Mr. Ford may be gutsiest man in Washington , but his proposals for " whipping inflation " lend no support to this proposition . In addition , the tone of the message constitutes an affront to that portion of the electorate  --  name your own percentage  --  which can be regarded as thoughtful . The opening reference to Franklin D. Roosevelt was grotesque ; for whatever reasons , President Ford @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; frustrations and needs of " the average man . " FDR knew how to cornmunicate , not because he was a great orator but because he responded warmly to people . President Ford has advised us more than once that he is no Lincoln ; hereafter he would be well advised not to cast himself in the image of a Roosevelt , for a Roosevelt ? Theodore or Franklin  --  he ' also is not . The Roosevelt bit can be condoned as a silly mistake . /Rut the ballyhoo portion of the message is deeply offensive . In his bid for popular support , the President managed to sound like a college cheerleader on the eve of the " big game . " The sloganizing was cheap and distasteful . Madison Avenue admen and Washington flacks should be able to turn out something more spine-tingling than " Whip Inflation Now . " The specifics of the appeal are absurd : cut the food you waste by 5 per cent ; drive less ; heat less ; car-pool ; wash in cold water . All this is worse than corny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an inconvenience to some elements in the economy ; to others it is a source of quick profit . But to millions  --  to the vast majority  --  it is a bitter reality . Yet there is cold comfort in the Ford message for those hardest hit . The proposed tax relief for lower-income groups is not significant and the make-work proposals are utterly inadequate . What kind of jobs program is it to set 208,000 persons to raking leaves  --  and that only when the jobless rate averages 6.5 per cent ? " ? The President has flubbed his first major challenge . Congressional reaction is largely negative ; conservatives and liberals , Republicans and Democrats object to aspects of the program , if for different reasons . Mr , Ford offered a paste-up job . Congress must now.take it apart , item by item , and produce something more closely resembling an action program . The President is right : the people want leadership. ? But leadership is , more than slogans . Benton &; Bowles , who invented the 1968 slogan , " Let 's all be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a " stinkeroo " ) will head up the Advertising Council 's ' orchestrated attempt to " Whip Inflation Now " ? with words . Patriotic citizens  --  and most citizens are patriotic  --  will resent being conned in this stupid fashion . But misleading slogans are worse than offensive ; they can damage Presidential credibility no less than falsehOods and deceptions . As a salesman , the President does not come from the used-car lot , but he has attempted to sell us a package of used ideas , none of which have much merit . Mr. Ford may be " a nice guy , " he may be " sincere " but he is not a leader , and this painful fact must now be faced by Congress , press and public . The President is modest about his proposals  --  there will be " no crash program . " Modesty is an attractive quality but it need not correlate with idiocy , Even as a symbol , a badge bearing " the single word WIN " does not " tell it all , " but it tells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Malaise of Foreign Policy ' That American foreign policy has become a shambles is a matter of common observation both at home and abroad , Neither the executive nor the legislative branch seems able to find a remedy ; it is one of those somethingmust-be-done situations about which no one in authority knows what to do , or can summon the courage to do it . r - Experience has shown that the Congress can not conduct foreign policy , even if that were the constitutional intent . It can exercise a degree of oversight ; the Senate can confirm appOintees or reject them , appropriations can be granted or withheld , but all that is marginal . The crucial decisions remain in the hands of the executive , and a degree of latitude is essential . The problem becomes critical when the executive persists in adhering to a foreign policy that has failed or is failing . That happened in Indochina . After a certain amount of boggling , the Senate , followed usually by the House , can become so irked by the palpable ineptitudes of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ite means of intervention is , the " restrictive amendment . " Restrictive amendments  --  seventeen or more  --  came thick and fast on the $2:5 billion foreign aid bill . Many were adopted on voice votes , and a symptomatic atmosphere of " frivolity " prevailed , It was as though the Senate and House said collectively : " Now look , you do n't listen , you wo n't acknowledge failure and propose sensible corrective measures . Very well , we can at least tie your bands . " So the Senate went on a binge . Cutbacks on aid to Turkey , Chile , South Korea , on the CIA 's covert operations department were adopted , discarded , readopted or abandoned in ad fib fashion . A lot of it was simply pre-election " showboating " for special constituencies , such as Greek-Americans , who outnumber Turkish-Americans . What with this and other Inotives , that did the legislators no greater credit , it soon became predictable that the measure would be referred back to the Senate Foreign Relations , Committee . That would seem to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the November elections . But a highly important point is involved here . Foreign economic ( aid must be considered in the context of foreign policy . Restrictive amendments are one way to express dissatisfaction or uneasiness , but they do not create a policy ; they lead only to fragmentation . What is needed is a thorough overhaul of U.S. foreign policy . The existing policies , such as they are , have many critics , but few general alternative policies or creative policy assumptions have been forthcoming . Yet it is obvious , that the premises of post-1945 U.S. policy demand re-examination . Increasingly after 1945 , . U , S. foreign policy became U.S. military poliCy . However concealed , the military component was paramount . This has meant policy dictated by military considerations , reflecting the views of army and air force generals , and admirals , as well as the CIA , which is entrusted with carrying on a continuous secret war . These military or paramilitary officials press their views and attain their objectives largely through more or less acquiescent civilian functionaries . William Rogers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partly subservient official . He opposed the wicked intervention in Chile , Henry Kissinger better represents the civillan in jackboots . His policy , like that of the reactionary 19th-century statesmen whom he admires , is based on the threat or use of military force against recalcitrant nations , especially small ones . He went along with the invasion , of Cambodia , the Christmas bombing The ' Honorarium ' Industry The saying is that the more corrupt a country , the more laws it needs . The Senate and the House of Representatives have just provided a small demonstration . " Honorarium " is the Congressional euphemism for speaking and writing fees . Last year , about three-quarters of the 100 Senators , and two-fifths of the 435 Representatives did some business in this line . No less than twenty-seven Senators received more than $15,000 apiece . The biggest earner was Sen. Hubert H. Humphrey , with fees of $65,650 . All told , sixty-three Senators received considerably more than $1 million . Only four Representatives were in the $15,000-plus bracket , and the total for the 189 House members @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disparity at all , and that was a factor in its version of the campaign finance bill which , after a House-Senate conference , set a limit of $1,000 on the amount any federal official can , accept for a single speech , article , or appearance , for a total of not more than $15,000 in any year . The unavoidable question is why the imposition of these limits became necessary . It is obvious that Senators and Representatives must and should address groUps to-44 clarify positions , explain legislation , answer questions , etc. 1i The objections arose because the practice had become a lucrative form of moonlighting for a good many Senators , and one cause of the chronic absenteeism which has become a scandal , especially in the Senate , Moreover , some of these honorariums have come from trade associations and business organizations which are simply giving " walking-around money " ? to friendly legislators  --  conflict of interest in the guise of unrelated emoluments . Although the focus is currently on members of Congress , other federal officials are guilty of the same practice . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the insensitivity of people who are supposed to be , and act like , public servants . These fees are not corrupting per se ; taking a few hundred dollars from a college audience , for ' stance , may be not only harmless but edifying for the Ill%dience . What is disgusting is that some of the worst offenders can not see what is wrong with abusing the practice . The abuse is the problem , and the abuse arises from an obsolescence of principle . It would be better if such matters could be regulated without rules and restrictions , with each individual acting in accordance with his own standards of conscience and decency . Earl Warren , for instance , had such standards ; he would not accept fees for speaking engagements . In the absence of such self-restraint on the part of a substantial number of persons who should be setting an example , laws must be passed which are humiliating not only to the offenders but to the country as a whole . ' Dear - Ronnie ' As the end of his second term approached  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ronald Reagan went on a veto rampage , , no doubt as a means of giving the back of his hand to legislative critics . With a reputation for being highly sensitive to legislative " slights , " he apparently built up a long list of grievances against particular legislators . On one day alone he vetoed 174 measures , ' many of these vetoes being characterized as " vindictive . " Included were Measures giving senior citizens a property tax break , a public housing measure , an appropriation for child care centers , a child labor bill , a $75 million boost to California schools , and a measure granting unemployment , compensation to 225,000 farm workers ( not all farm workers by any means ) . But he did sign some bills  --  for , example , one to outlaw pay toilets in state buildings , a measure which would seem to mark the outer boundary of the Governor 's social conscience . Having thus given vent to his feelings , the Governor left on a five-day cross-country political speaking tour . In Council Bluffs , Iowa , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had wisely chosen " the work ethic over the federal handout . " Thunderous cheers from an audience of farmers optimistic about their prospects of getting $45 an acre drought relief payments from the federal government . As to raising taxes to curb inflation it would be like " telling a drunk another drink will sober him up . " Wild laughter . Down in Pampa , in the Texas Panhandle , in a grove of cottonwood trees , the Governor told an audience of oilmen that if the government should decontrol crude oil and naturall gas prices , it would send a message to those pesky Middle Eastern - oil sheiks that would get about the same attention " you get from a mule when you hit it with a 2-by-4 . " Delirious applause . As to how the Governor deals with giveaways , a story in the Los Angeles Times ( October 2 ) provides an interesting example . The Sand and Sea Club , a private organization , has for some years leased a parcel of state-owned land for which it pays $45,000 ' a year rental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of what the Auditor General thinks it should be : There is also ' a serious question as to whether the arrangement constitutes " an improper use of state land . " But when efforts were made to terminate this cozy arrangement , a rich lady who had contributed $17,000 to the Governor 's re-election campaign in 1970 wrote a " Dear ' Ronnie " letter  --  she is an important figure in the club and in the social life of Beverly Hills  --  and that did it . The Sand and Sea Club members will enjoy their . privileges at least until 1981 . Down in Arkansas the Governor , who is obviously running hard for something , declined to issue " a Sherman-like statement " about 1976 . When asked why , he replied : " Well , I did n't fall off a bridge . " Dear Ronnie has a nifty way with those one-line gags but maybe he should resume his acting career or fall off a bridge . Do n't be surprised , though , if he heads up some kind of " movement " in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in federal office , buildings . Tops in Brutality Irvin S. Cobb described the typical fight fan as " the soft-fleshed , hard-faced person who keeps his own pelt safe from bruises , but whose eyes glisten and whose hackles lift at the prospect of somebody else whipped to a souffle . " What would he have thought of dogfight promoters and fans ? Boxing is a recognized sport , and even in its professional form is engaged in voluntarily . Pugilists rarely kill each other . Dogfights are often to the death , and even when one of the dogs " curs out " he may die anyway , either from , his wounds or because his owner no longer has any use for him . Professionally staged dogfighting , though illegal in all fifty states ( in England it was outlawed a century ago ) , is spreading from coast to coast . The number of promoters and patrons is estimated at 4,000 to 5,000 . Localities in which the " sport " is flourishing include Southern California , and parts of Florida , Illinois , Oklahoma , Massachusetts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ area and , especially , Texas . Wayne King describes the Texas dogfight boom in The New York Times ( September 16 ) . The owner of a champion fighting dog in Dallas was willing to talk on condition of anonymity . " I 'll tell you one thing I always see at these fights , " he confided , ' " and that 's pistols . " Last December 30 an editorial in one of the dogfighting magazines ( their mailing lists are secret ) deplored the gangland-type slaying of two prominent aficionados . Such behavior , the magazine suggested , could give dogfighting a bad name . In another incident , four shots were fired into the car of a volunteer humane investigator . The Chicago Tribune and Portland ( Me . ) Evening Express have joined in the attack on professional dogfighting and a good , deal is now known of what goes on . Fighting dogs are either pure-bred Staffordshire bull terriers or " Staffs " crossed with bull mastiffs . , The training regimen - is rigorous . Puppies selected for aggressiveness are given kittens to kill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and later small dogs . According to one expert 's estimate , an average fighting dog kills 100 cats and dogs during training . 357 Many of the " conventions " are small , but a big one , held in a barn or warehouse , will draw as many as 500 spectators , who pay an admission charge , collected by the promoter , of between $3 ' and $10 . A fight card for a big meet may consist of six to ten matched sets of dogs , and bouts last from twenty minutes to 21/2 hours . Dogfight fans think of themselves as good , virile Americans who believe it is natural for dogs to want to fight and " die gloriously . " Women , even children , attend some of the meets . Beer is sold and occasionally wifskey , and prostitutes circulate at the big meets which , even without this added patronage , fill up the local motels . The police are paid off in advance and security arrangements areelaborate . As one would expect , gambling is heavy . Bets may run as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few hundred dollars is nearer the average , and at small meets $5 to $10 is offered and taken . At this stage it is impossible to say whether the spread of dogfighting evidences further deterioration of the national character or is just an offshoot of the mania fcip sports and gambling . Either way , it is a national disgrace - and since state laws have proved inadequate , federal legislation , introduced by Rep. Peter N. Kyros of Maine and Sen. Harrison A. Williams of New Jersey , joined by Sen. Lowell P. Weicker of Connecticut and others , deserves support .
