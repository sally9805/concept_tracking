A SAVAGE WAR OF PEACE by Alistair Horne Viking ; 604 pages ; $19.95 <P> All Saints ' Day , a Christian feast that commemorates the spiritual heroism of the early martyrs , has a double significance to the French . With a canny sense of symbolism , Algeria 's fledgling Front de Libration Nationale ( F.L.N. ) chose Nov. 1 , 1954 , as the day to launch its rebellion . In the wintry mountains of the Aurs , Muslim djounoud ( soldiers of the faith ) attacked a police station at Biskra , wounding two gendarmes . At Khenchela , a lieutenant , Grard Darneau , was mortally wounded by machine-gun fire-the first French officer to die in the conflict . <P> The troubles in Algeria were barely noted in Paris newspapers , even though an F.L.N. proclamation of the struggle for independence was broadcast by Cairo radio and circulated in pamphlets throughout the country . Nonetheless , the All Saints ' uprising-swiftly followed by savage reprisals against Algeria 's Muslim majority-marked the beginning of a bloody conflict that lasted for nearly eight years . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eradication of the French presence in North Africa . But at what a cost ! According to Algerian figures , as many as 1 million Muslims died during and after the war . French casualties , military and civilian , are estimated at 27,000 killed and some 65,000 injured . When the end came , a terrible exodus began . Forced to choose between " the suitcase or the coffin , " nearly 1 million white pied noir settlers tearfully abandoned their homeland . For more than a century it had been considered as much a part of France as Brittany or Provence . <P> As A Savage War of Peace notes , France 's involvement with Algeria proved more trap than treasure from the beginning . Armies of the Bourbon King Charles X first laid claim to the old Barbary coast in 1830 ; in 1847 Algeria was formally incorporated into France as three huge departments . The white colons were French citizens ; the native Muslims were merely residents , subject to taxes and military service but with very limited voting privileges . From time to time , men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , only to see the reforms rejected by the pieds noirs and their archconservative allies in Paris . <P> Algeria was the last colonial war , although , as Author Horne observes , the situation that created it has certain parallels to Rhodesia and South Africa . Embittered by its recent defeat at Dien Bien Phu , the French army was determined not to let it happen in Algeria , and twice the war was nearly won . In 1957 the feared paratroopers of General Jacques Massu , using torture on a scale that shocked and sickened Frenchmen , destroyed the F.L.N. underground network during the Battle of Algiers . Two years later , punishing French raids shattered the morale of starving , undersupplied F.L.N. units in rural strongholds . <P> Many of the cadres seemed ready to sue for peace . With some justice , French commanders complained that decisive thrusts against the F.L.N. were frustrated by the waffling of politicians in Paris . Thus the generals had plotted to undermine the rudderless Fourth Republic and restore De Gaulle to power .         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
