A giant roasting spit . Parts of a turn-of-the-century Hispano-Suiza . Bicycle chains and wheels . Parts of a plowshare . A face that indicates time round the world . All this adds up to one of the world 's most offbeat clocks-a 5,000-lb. , 15-ft. - tall monster that stands in the transit lounge of Geneva 's new international airport . <P> The Geneva contraption is one of a kind . So is its creator , Joseph Heeb , 42 , certainly no typical Swiss . He wears a grizzled beard and hair down to his shoulders , drives a vintage Jaguar roadster , dresses like a Left Bank bohemian . His extraordinary custom-built timepieces , which incorporate bicycle wheels , saddle springs , farm tools and dismembered typewriters , also adorn the Geneva branch of the First National City Bank , a suburban Geneva theater , and the homes of well-to-do collectors from Europe to California . No trained artist , Heeb started his career as a repairer of musical instruments-saxophones , trombones and the like-then took up the restoration of antiques . He came to specialize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Switzerland for raw material , patching and selling them at a profit . <P> Extra Cogs . From there it was a short step to the grotesque timepieces he now builds . At the heart of each clock is usually an old pendulum movement . His favorite is the French Morbier , a standard for grandfather clocks , but these are increasingly hard to find . He tacks on additional cogwheels , pinions and escape mechanisms . " These are not really necessary to make the thing work , " he says , " but they add motion . I also like to move the pendulum off center , and then I weld on all sorts of ironware to give it shape and expression . For the really big pieces , I select a drive train from a small Swiss factory that makes movements for church-tower clocks . " <P> Such work does not come cheap . <P> The clock he built for the airport cost about $4,600 . Even more expensive ( about $10,000 ) was the First National City timepiece . It features a peacock , made of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feathers regularly every 15 minutes . Now he is working on several small wall clocks , turning them out in batches of half a dozen or so and selling them for upwards of $650 . <P> Heeb says that his imaginative clocks are " a protest against the stupidity of this cold modern world . " Accordingly , his works carry lighthearted names : " Day to Day , " " Joy , " " More Than Time , " " Lust for Life , " and " Homage to St. Exupery , " his favorite author . He is quick to admit that he was inspired originally by the self-destructing machines of Fellow Swiss Artist Jean Tinguely , but he disagrees with Tinguely 's ideas . " He is one of those modern pessimists who proclaim that nothing endures , " charges Heeb . " I am against anarchy in art or philosophy . Spiritually , Tinguely 's creations do n't work . " <P> Heeb 's clocks do . " I can achieve accuracy to within a few seconds a day , " he claims , but he denies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I am not trying to compete with Longines or Omega , " explains Heeb . " I have never repaired a watch in my life . "
