One of the ironies of Washington 's position as the nation 's capital is that it has long lacked congressional representation of its own . As the flight of whites from the city proceeded apace ( 71% of the 756,000 residents are now blacks ) , this absence of franchise came to take on racial overtones . At least the beginnings of a remedy were provided last week with the election of Walter E. Fauntroy , 37 , a black Baptist minister , as the capital 's first Representative in 96 years. *With one hand clenched in a Black Power salute and the other raised in a " V " peace sign , the ebullient Democrat swept 58.5% of the vote to outdistance John Nevius ( 25% ) , a white Republican attorney , and four other black candidates . <P> The catch in Fauntroy 's election is that he will be a nonvoting member of the House ; he also becomes the 437th member , which places him on the last rung of the seniority ladder . Otherwise , he receives full congressional privileges , including an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of $42,500 , a vote on the House District of Columbia Committee ( where he will likely be placed ) , and the right to introduce legislation . <P> A former aide to the late Martin Luther King , Fauntroy has style and personal magnetism . His lively manner and soaring rhetoric reflect careful study of his mentor . Fauntroy campaigned ( with the help of Mrs. Coretta King ) on the theme " He 's going to get us all together . " His goals : home rule for Washington and full representation and voting privileges for the capital in Congress . <P> Guaranteed Income . Fauntroy 's initial act was to join the twelve other black Congressmen-all Democrats-in their long-sought confrontation with President Nixon . The black caucus , which meets each week , first tried to gain an interview with the President a year ago , and was put off because of " scheduling difficulties . " These difficulties persisted-rather embarrassingly - for nearly a year until the Congressmen boycotted the President 's State of the Union message last January . Nixon last week finally granted a hearing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a yellow pad as the Congressmen spoke . They eschewed rhetoric in favor of a carefully prepared brief and a tough look at key issues . Representative Charles Diggs of Michigan , caucus chairman , stated in plain terms that the plight of the nation 's blacks is so critical that an upswing in the economy alone will not significantly help them . <P> Said Diggs : " Since you assumed office , we have spent billions of dollars on the war , over 2,000,000 Americans have been added to the ranks of the unemployed , and 2,500,000 more are on the ever-mounting relief roles . " Their list of recommendations included replacement of the welfare system with a guaranteed annual income and stronger enforcement of civil rights laws .
