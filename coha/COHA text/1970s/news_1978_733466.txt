txt WASHINGTON  --  President Carter outlined Thursday night a $25 billion tax cut and called for a voluntary limit on wage and price increases as he declared that " we Americans have a great deal of work to do together . " " IL has been said that our best years are behind us , " Carter said in his first State of the Union Message , " but I say again that . America 's best is still ahead . " Carter opened his address to Congress by saying the nation is sound militarily , politically , economically , and spiritually , but he quickly pounced on the problem of the times  --  energy . " ON ENERGY legislation we have failed the American people , " Carter said . He said the stalemate in Congress holding up an energy program can not be tolerated much longer because " it undermines our national interest both at home and abroad . " Carter cited a " new atmosphere " in the land , requiring a partnership between leaders and citizens based on truth and the " courage to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same time he cautioned that Washington ca n't do everything . " Those who govern can sometimes inspire , and we can identify needs and marshal resources , but we can not be the managers of everything and everybody , " he said . The theme of his message was the economy " our main task at home this year , " with energy the key element . TO MAKE his nationally televised speech easier on members of Congress and the viewers at home , Carter edited his remarks to under 30 minutes . But with about 40 interruptions for applause , he spoke about 45 minutes . When Presidents John Kennedy , Lyndon Johnson , Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford gave their State of the Union messages , it usually took them time to get to and from the rostrum . All had served in Congress and they had to stop and shake hands of old friends . But Carter , his family watching from the VIP gallery , walked almost directly to the ros . trum and out afterward .

" What is best for the farm families in the long run is best for the consumers of our country , " Carter said to some of the most sustained applause of the evening . Another burst of applause , mainly from Democrats , greeted his remarks calling for approval of the Panama Canal treaties , applause that he called " most welcome .

" THEIR ADOPTION will help achieve the kind of economic prosperity for our nation that all of us want , " Carter said .

" While Carter 's State of the Union report emphasized the nation 's economic situation , it listed other proposals in areas from health to ethics . He promised to submit a national health insurance plan . He said even though he did n't expect Congress would be able to pass it in 1978 it was important to begin a national debate on the complex issues involved . He called for reform of the Civil Service system , to provide incentives to improve efficiency and reduce red tape . CARTER URGED the creation of an office of consumer representation , to consolidate all consumer offices in government . He promised to press for legislation requiring registration of lobbyists and public disclosure of their activities . Carter subordinated military and foreign affairs to domestic issues , observing , " For the first time in a generation , we are not haunted by a major international crisis or by domestic turmoil . " In foreign policy , he said : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ source of weakness and error ...

He promised that if the Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty talks result in an agreement this year , " the agreement will maintain and enhance the stability of the world 's strategic balance and the security of the United States . " The whole world , he pointed out , has a stake in the success of the . current Middle East negotiations , " a precious opportunity " to settle an ancient conflict " which may not come again in our lifetime .
