The Paranoid Prisoner <P> To the Editors : <P> Re : your story on Howard Hughes Dec. 13 . It is ironic that a man capable of building and directing a billion-dollar conglomerate was the architect of such a pathetic paranoid prison for himself . However , his Christian aides resemble piranhas more than Christians . <P> Those of us who drink and smoke could n't be any worse off than that wretched soul surrounded by Kleenex boxes and paper toweling . <P> Donna W. Blue Birmingham , Mich . <P> What a horror story ! And the most frightening realization is that our society would drive a man to such desperate lengths to attain the right of every human being , the right to privacy . <P> ( Mrs. ) Charlene Franklin Santa Ana , Calif . <P> How sad that one 's final reaction to the richest man in America is " poor , lonely , pitiful Howard Hughes . " <P> E. Ries Myers Baltimore <P> If Howard Hughes had been on the welfare rolls anywhere in the U.S. he would be alive today . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Y. <P> Sometimes I wonder how a plain college girl like me could ever possibly help a billionaire , but after reading the article on Hughes , I feel that I could have done something for the poor old man . <P> Carla Gaskamp El Campo , Texas <P> Howard Hughes has been many things to many men-and women . But TIME 's cover portrait of the dying junkie billionaire seems to be stretching artistic license rather thin by giving us not reality , the wreck , but an almost mirror image of Leonardo da Vinci 's last self-portrait . <P> David Douglas Duncan Mouans-Sartoux , France <P> <P> Blissful Dozing <P> As with most analyses of hypothetical combat situations , your article concerning NATO 's vulnerability to a Russian attack Dec. 13 dealt too much with machines and not enough with men . <P> I recently returned from Germany , where I was a member of our renowned U.S. Army . I can honestly state that if Russia had decided to go with their blitz , we would have been extremely lucky to get out of the motor pool . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unable to coordinate even within the company . The larger the training exercise , the more confusion was evident . I have spent many blissful hours dozing in the back of an APC while the officers were off somewhere vainly attempting to figure out where we were , where we were going and just what we were doing . For myself and my fellow soldiers , it was something to laugh at and shake our heads about . But certainly , it is no laughing matter . <P> Kenneth D. Moore Irving , Texas <P> <P> Network Hustlers <P> Thank God for a writer like Paddy Chayefsky , who wrote the script for Network Dec. 13 . <P> Do the network hustlers who believe viewer ratings and product sales are the total of TV acceptance ever wonder who the millions are who do n't watch and do n't buy ? <P> Jon Homer Gainesville , Fla . <P> As I gaze into my crystal ball , I see Harry Reasoner singing the news with Barbara Walters tap dancing in the background .
