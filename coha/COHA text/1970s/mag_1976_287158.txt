" Andrew , do you realize that you 're a gutless chameleon ? " asked Teacher Jim Searles of the shy , withdrawn teen-ager who had come for an interview at the Hyde School in Bath , Me . Andrew was close to tears , but Searles was only following the sock-it-to-'em pedagogic philosophy of his boss , Hyde Founder Joseph Gauld , 50 . Faced with a rebellious applicant , Gauld once shouted , " Listen , I 'm telling you either change your attitude around me or I will jam it down your throat . " <P> Although annual fees for tuition , board and room add up to a hefty $4,700 , life at the small ( enrollment : 175 ) coed boarding school is almost as rigorous as that of a Marine boot camp . Many of the students are troubled , and short-tempered Gauld treats them like a drill instructor faced with a platoon of left-footed recruits . He occasionally slaps and routinely humiliates the kids-with their parents ' tacit consent-in a no-holds-barred effort to toughen them up and build their characters . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Gauld likes to say . When he finds that a student has what he considers a " bad attitude , " Gauld may order him to wear a sign saying I ACT LIKE A BABY , or tell him to dig a 6-ft. by 6-ft. trench and then fill it up . He has even conducted a public paddling ceremony at Hyde . <P> As headmaster at Berwick Academy in South Berwick , Me. , in the early ' 60s , Gauld ( who has degrees from Bowdoin College and Boston University ) grew discouraged with what he saw as the " coddling " of students , and an overemphasis on grades . With $100,000 borrowed from family and friends , Gauld bought an old mansion on the Maine coast and set up a school devoted to developing self-confidence and selfdiscipline . Novel and untested , Hyde could not hope to attract outstanding students ; thus Gauld started by accepting teen-agers with a history of mental illness or drug problems . The student body now includes less disturbed youngsters . However , all of them , Gauld says , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a greater capacity for growth than conventional , " successful " children . <P> Character Grades . Success at Hyde is measured largely by " character growth " rather than academic excellence . Students are given two sets of grades : one for performance in a traditional curriculum laden with remedial courses ; the other , which is considered more important , for overcoming personal problems such as being shy or cowardly , as shown in survival tests the school has copied from Outward Bound . The grades in character development are hammered out in a kind of encounter group , where classmates and teachers urge a student to confess his strengths and weaknesses . In similar sessions , teachers are evaluated publicly by the students . <P> So , in a way , are parents . As one alumnus puts it , " A family , not a kid , comes to Hyde . " Parents are required to make a strong commitment to Hyde 's philosophy . They participate in two encounter weekend seminars annually , at which everyone criticizes everyone else . One father , for example , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to agree with Bill . You do seem more concerned with your own image than anything else . "
