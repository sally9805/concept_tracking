txt For some four hours one night this month East African Airways could not find one of its three DC-9 's . Speculation continues here that the aircraft 's disappearance and the insurgent invasion of southwestern Uganda , launched from Tanzanian soil two days later , were not unrelated events . Tanzanian authorities were deeply involved in facilitating preparations for the invasion . And the plane was stolen on Tanzanian territory . According to aviation sources here , Tanzanian officials have , mrefused to reveal what th they know about the mystery hijack , either to East African Airways which owns the plane , or to the East African Directorate of Civil Aviation , the body controlling aviation in this region . The facts of the hijack ? or those that have been made public ? are these : The plane was taken from Dar es Salaam airport between 11:30 and 1:30 on the night of Sept. 14-15 . Apparently a group of men " virtually took over the airport , " and two of them , dressed in what appeared to be EAA pilot uniforms , spirited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take passengers ? Little has been said about that . The aircraft was found the next morning at Kilimanjaro airport , halfway between Moshi and Arusha . It seems to have landed in darkness sometime between 2:30 and dawn , the pilot applying the brakes hard and bursting the tires . Since the airport closes at 1 a.m. , the plane came down without tower assistance ? at least not official assistance . The pilot and the presumed co-pilot vanished . Tanzanian police are searching the slopes of Mt . Kilimanjaro for two theft-inclined pilots , but no one really suspects that they will be apprehended in a maize field . An obvious aspect of the mystery is that not everyone can fly a DC-9 . It is assumed that an Uganda and Tanzania backing away from brink Page 2 e )  -- iperiencedpilot made off with the plane since he was **32;922;TOOLONG relatively little damage . But , aviation sources here speculate , the man need not have been an extraordinarily talented pilot unless he was flying the plane alone . It is not inconceivable that the Kilt manjaro instrument-landing system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mystery flight . Navigational aids available But even without the instrument-landing system , other navigational aids were available . A Very High Frequency Omni-Range system , as well as marker beacons , operates at Kilimanjaro around the clock . Detailed published landing information is easily available . In any case , it is suggested , DC-9 pilots are not that hard to find for someone who has the money to ' spend . The Swiss-published Interavia magazine notes that more than 600 DC-9 's have been delivered to airlines . That means more than 5,000 pilots know how to fly them . But why would anyone want to steal a 90-plus seat passenger plane , use it for three to five hours , and then return it ? There are several theories . One speaks of a disgruntled airways pilot ; others of a Kenya Air Force pilot and an Italian who wanted an unusual joyride . There are also theories about people wanting to escape Tanzania , or to cause it embarrassment . // *Tanzania 's DC-9 mystery Cominued from Page 1 But the invasion theory is the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before it started . This theory in turn has several variations . One claims that the plane was supposed to pick up troops at Kilimanjaro and fly them to an unknown destination in Uganda , a project foiled by damage done to the tires . But , skeptics ask , why not load the troops in Dar es Salaam , especially if Tanzanian authorities condoned the hijack . How speculation goes Another line of speculation suggests that the plane was supposed to be taken to western Tanzania where most of the guerrillas were , and then used in an air strike against Entebbe , Uganda 's only international airport , which also houses an Air Force fightersquadron . But there is some question about the capability of western Tanzanian airports to handle a DC-9 , and could it be hidden for two days ? Another supposition is that the plane loaded some 100 parachute troops in Dar es Salaam , flew them to southwestern Uganda ? to some lightly populated area near Mbarara , for example ? dropped them through the tail exit , and returned to Kilimanjaro . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tanzania-Uganda border prior to the Sunday invasion . But if the insurgents succeeded in stealing a plane , why did n't they attack Entebbe , a blow that would have seriously undermined the Amin government 's morale ? the answer to that is part of t ie iy y . While investigations now are under way , it is doubtful that the public will learn soon what actually happened .
