Mr. Simpson testifies : " I deeply regret that the agency thus will be unalbe to do as much as planned to end the manufacture and sale of hazardous products . " It can not meet the 1982 goal , he says . Further interviews with congressional staff sources who deal with consumer-related issues indicate Congress is unlikely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needed .

During the late 1960s and early 1970s constituents pushed their senators and representatives for strong pro-consumer proposals ; now this push has substantially dissipated , say several congressional staff sources . In its place is a constituent demand for more economies to hold down taxes .
