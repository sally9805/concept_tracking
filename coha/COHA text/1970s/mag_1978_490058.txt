THE TALK OF THE TOWN Notes and Comment IN our all but newspaperless town , the wonderful news from Camp David was conveyed mainly on television . ( Three of the four tem  --  porary newspapers that have been fill  --  ing in for the duration of the strike went to press before the settlement was announced , ) The experience was a joyful one . Television is the public medium par excellence . Beaming its news , as it now does , over the whole earth , it gathers the earth 's people into a single audience . Not a global village but a global amphitheatre is what tele  --  vision creates . At times during the an  --  nouncement of the agreements in the East Room of the White House , as we listened to the many religious references made by President Carter , President Sadat , and Prime Minister Begin and witnessed the evident devoutness of the three men in their respective religions , it seemed to us that the world had tetnporarily been turned into a vast church and its people into a congrega @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  tion in which a single language is spo  --  ken , but it can not bring together the world , in which many languages are spoken . Live pictures alone , which transcend barriers of language , can cre  --  ate a synchronous global experience . ) The mood of the participants was ebul  --  lient but  --  uncharacteristically for sum  --  mit conferees  --  humble . Their religious faith must have been partly responsible for this apparent modesty , but the cov  --  erage of global television may also have been a cause . They were stepping out before a large and expectant audience to which they seemed to feel answer  --  able . Visibility is not yet accountability , but it is a step in that direction . The joy in the East Room was a communal joy , and the community was the whole world . For all that , we sorely missed the papers . The next morning , we felt a yearning for confirmation of what had happened that only tall , black headlines could satisfy . Without printed cover  --  age , the event @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Print offers little in the . way of communal experience with a world audience ; by contrast with television , it is a private medi  --  um . Many people may read what is printed , but they do so at their leisure , when and where they wish . Each read  --  er is alone . Is n't this why it is an in  --  vasion of privacy to read over some  --  one 's shoulder ? And is n't this also why gossip columns , which have proliferated so widely in newspapers recently , have failed to catch on much on television ? Print can whisper confidentially to the reader ; television is always addressing a crowd . But if only television can pro  --  vide the horizontal dimension of a world community , only print can pro  --  vide the vertical dimension  --  the dimen  --  sion of time . Television vanishes into thin air , but newspapers endure . In a sense , what happens on television oc  --  curs in the present alone , whereas what happens in print goes on happen  --  ing indefinitely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of history . ( The temporary papers may have seemed unsatisfactory precisely because they themselves are fated soon to dis  --  appear from the scene . ) The Times is said to be the country 's newspaper of record ; it would be absurd to speak of a television station of record . Televi  --  sion may have become our eyes and ears and nur public meeting place , but print continues to be our memory . THAT durable tragicomedy " The Stock Market Story ; or , Boom and Bust in Quick Succession " ? it has been playing intermittently in various parts of the world since early in the seven  --  teenth century , when it opened in Am  --  sterdam has been unfolding a new , though familiar , act in LVall Street lately , where gambling-casino stocks are the current rage . The rage seems to have begun with the inauguration , in May , of legal gambling in Atlantic City , which apparently has more reality for Eastern investors than places like Reno and Las Vegas . A couple of weeks ago , the Class A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rose twenty-three dollars a share in a single day 's trading , and the same com  --  pany 's Class B stock rose fifty-four dol  --  lars . For that entire week , the Class A stock rose more than forty-five dol  --  lars and the Class B about a hundred and ten dollars . ( The cute plot twist in the new act is that Resorts Internation  --  al stock went through a previous boom and bust less than a decade ago , when the company was considered a con  --  glomerate rather than a casino opera  --  tor , and had recently graduated from being called Mary Carter Paint Com  --  pany ; its stock , having peaked at al  --  most sixty-two in 1969 , fetched up in August , 1970 , at fess than five . ) Con  --  scientiously seeking to save investors from the predictable bust , the New York Stock Exchange , the American Stock Exchange , and the National As  --  sociation of Securities Dealers increased the percentage of cash in relation to credit required to buy the leading casino stocks , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dissuade their customers from buying those stocks just now . Any ticket-holder to the show knows that trying to protect plungers from their folly in such a mad moment is a task somewhat like Canute 's against the sea , but surely no one knows it bet  --  ter just now than the nation 's largest brokerage firm , Merrill Lynch , Pierce , Fenner &; Smith . According to the W all Street Journal , a Long Island bagel baker named Jerry Steurman walked into a Merrill Lynch office on a Thursday afternoon a few weeks ago , handed eight hundred dollars to a cashier , and told a broker to buy him various casino stocks . Merrill Lynch and Mr. Steurman differ about wheth  --  er Merrill Lynch failed to do so because Mr. Steurman wanted the stocks at prices that were not available or just because the firm thought Mr. Steur  --  man had better not have the stocks ; at any rate , the stocks were n't bought . The following Monday , Mr. Steurman turned up again . This time , he threw a wad of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ de  --  manded that the money be put into casino stocks forthwith , When Merrill Lynch did n't comply , Mr. Steurman handcuffed himself to the office door . " All I wanted was someone to talk with me , " he said later . " I opened the door and closed the door  --  I was like a doorman . " Some hours later , af  --  ter the police had been called and ne gotiations conducted , Mr. Steurman agreed to leave and not return , while Merrill Lynch subsequently agreed to give him back his stake plus an addi  --  tional twenty-four hundred dollars  --  that sum , a Merrill Lynch man ex  --  plained , representing approximately the profit Mr. Steurman would have made if Merrill Lynch had invested his mon  --  ey when and how he had wanted them to . All sorts of questions remain un  --  answered . Can anybody make a quick twenty-four hundred dollars as a vol  --  unteer doorman at Merrill Lynch ? If the casino stocks had gone down rath  --  er than UP , would Mr. Steurman still be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' - hat is clear is that in the current re  --  vival of the old show Mr. Steurman has won himself star billing . ? ? Tut Tickets MHOUSANDS of people stood in - I-  line . Tens of thousands , if you consider those who waited at Tick etron outlets all over the metropolitan area . People stood in line for thirty hours or more , in drizzle and haze and rain , equipped with sleeping bags , blankets , cushions , foam-rubber seats , sandwiches , canteens , umbrellas , books , magazines . All in order to get tickets to the " Treasures of Tutankhamun " exhibition , which will be on display at the Metropolitan Museum of Art from December 20th through April 15th . The exhibition has already drawn sell  --  out crowds at museums in five Ameri  --  can cities , and a mammoth ticket rush was expected here . We decided to go to the Met itself and see what life on the line was like . An improvised Tick  --  etron outlet was scheduled to open there at S A.M. on Monday of last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 10 A.m. , and at all the outlets tickets were being said not only for a certain day but for a certain half hour . We turned up at six Monday morn  --  ing . The sky was black . The air was damp . A great crowd had formed . People were friendly and orderly and patient . And they were talkative . " How many tickets are there alto  --  gether ? " " Somebody told me about nine hundred thousand . " " What if they run out of tickets ? " " Where are we on this fine ? " " I simply ca n't un  --  derstand why they 're giving out four tickets to each person . " " Do you see that man in the checked coat ? I swear he turns up on every line in town . " Just ahead of us was a British woman wearing a tan raincoat and sensible shoes . She gathered some of us around her , like a schoolteacher , and recount  --  ed the events that led up to the day when the party headed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  bert , the Fifth Earl of Carnarvon , dis  --  covered Tutankhamun 's tomb , in 1922 . " The tomb had already been plundered , but only a little , " she said . " I mean way back in the time of King Tut . Vandals . But they took only small things  --  things they could carry easily  --  and only from the outer rooms . No one entered the main burial chamber until Lord Carnarvon 's group , and they worked the site for six years before they found it . In the last year , Lord Carnarvon almost gave up  --  he had poured a great deal of his money into the expedition  --  but he and Carter were corn4nceri they had found the right place . Meanwhile , a similar ex  --  pedition from the Metropolitan Mu  --  seum was working an adjacent site . When the tomb was opened , the Met people just went right over and helped Lord Carnarvon 's people  --  everyone cooperated . Of course , Lord Car  --  narvon died the next year . He was so exhausted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a mosquito . But all that curse business is nonsense . " At eight , it began to rain . It was a great , drenching downpour , and umbrellas popped open . People without umbrellas were given shelter by people who had them . Ahead of us , starting at the southern end of the museum , at Eightieth Street , and stretching north  --  ward for a block , was a line of about six hundred people . A gray-suited mu  --  seum official was walking about brisk  --  ly , answering questions as he explained to us that the northward-extending line had been formed inadvertently , and that the line we were part of , a bunched-up line of some seven thou  --  sand people which ran all the way south to Seventy-second Street and curved into Central Park , was the " real " line . " We 're going to Iet the people in the inadvertent line go in first , " the official said . " Then we 'll open tip the real line , " At eight-thirty , the rain stopped abruptly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her office . Other peo  --  ple kept her place for her , and when she returned she said , " I 'm just no good at lying , so I told my supervisor that I 'd be late for work this morning because I had to attend to an urgent personal matter . And that 's the truth  --  this is an urgent personal matter . " At about nine-forty-five , our part of the line started to enter the museum 's south entrance , and just after ten we reached a Ticketron window . When we came nut again , it had turned into a hazily bright morning . Though the air was still damp , it felt refreshing , cool , and clean . Near the head of the real line , under a green-and-white canopy , a brass band had begun to play a Scott Joplin rag . A trumpet gleamed in the sun , and people were snapping their fingers . Moment in History MOSHE DAYAN , Israel 's Minister of Foreign Affairs , stopped in New York last week for a few hours on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held at Camp David , and we had the pleasure of meeting him at his midtown hotel for a talk about his camp experiences . We had seen the Foreign Affairg Minister briefly two - weeks earlier , when he was on his way to the summit , which was the culmination , for him , of a year of secret meetings , as well as announced conferences , in various parts of the world  --  including the one this past summer at Leeds Castle , in England  --  with other leaders , trying to work out agreements that would bring peace to the Middle East . Before the summit meeting , Mr. Dayan was , to put it mildly , solemn . " I 've been doing my homework for thirty years preparing for this meeting , " he told us . This time , he was buoyant , jovial , unguarded in his excitement about the outcome , and eager to share  --  as he graciously answered our questions  --  the adventures of his life in the woods with his fellow-campers : President Carter , President Sadat , Prime Minister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curity Affairs Assistant Brzezinski , and members of the diplomatic staffs of Israel , Egypt , and the United States . " Well , I feel now as though I had my exam and did well in it , " Mr. Dayan said as we settled down for our talk in a corner of a deserted cafe at his hotel . He had ordered Sanka and macaroons , and he downed a couple of the latter with zest while apologizing for wearing the same wrinkled , blue-gray tropical suit that we had last seen him in . " I could n't bear to unpack my suitcase one more time , " he said . " Most of the time at camp , I went around in old pants and an old shirt and an old gray cardigan sweater borrowed from a New York friend . Everybody else at the camp wore comfortable clothes , too . President Carter wore his bluej cans . " Mr. Dayan took a small bite of macaroon . " Your President , " he told us , is a wonderful man  --  intelligent , tenacious , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He gave a laugh . " The President 's wife , Rosalynn , said to me early in the conference , ' Jimmy will never let down or let go . He wants to win . ' And it was true . President Carter has the ability to receive , ab  --  sorb , digest , and return information , facts , statistics almost immediately . He is constantly learning . He was con  --  stantly taking notes . He was always writing out formulas and revising them . He was always asking you to please re  --  peat what you had just said , studying his notes and changing them . Your President is not a man you should cross unless you are certain of your facts and unless you are right . He will look straight into your eyes and say to you , You are not being sincere with me . You are not telling me the truth . ' And you had better be sure you are right , because he Will keep after you on any point until he is satisfied . The outcome of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to refuse to let it hog down . There were many moments when it was touch and go . Four hours before the conclusion of the conference , the whole thing almost ended over the question of the future of Jerusalem . But President Carter was not going to let anyone leave until success was achieved . His will not to fail is fan  --  tastic . Everyone treated him with great respect . I think everyone at Camp Da  --  vid recognized his quality . Everyone called him ' Mr. President . ' I did , too , of course , even though he called me Moshe . ' " Mr. Dayan helped himself to an  --  other macaroon and went on , " I had a meeting with President Carter alone about halfway through the conference . We met at 3 A.M. , on the patio of the President 's cabin , and finished two hours later . While we were talking , I noticed that President Carter was do  --  ing something with his hands , and it turned out that he was shelling peanuts and putting the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been prepared in a special way , according to a special Southern formula . ' Try them . You 'll like them , ' he said to me . I did , and I did . We had many little enve  --  lopes filled with peanut shells by the time we finished talking . " We told the Foreign Affairs Min  --  ister that we were very curious about the daily routine during the conference . He gave us an understanding nod . " At Camp David , day and night ran into each other , " he said . " Meetings lasted until four o'clock in the morn  --  ing , and often two or three men would stay on after that and talk until sun  --  rise . I worked all day every day , and almost all night every night . Sometimes I would meet alone with Secretary Vance , whom I have always liked very much . He is a very fair and objective man . Sometimes I would meet with Mohammed Ibrahim Kamel , Sadat 's Foreign Minister , or with my own staff , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ambassador to Israel . We all met with one another and then we met with someone else . Sometimes in the middle of a meeting with President Carter , he would say to Begin , ' Ex  --  cuse me , I have to discuss this point with Sadat , ' and he would leave for a few minutes and then return and continue the meeting . It was shuttle di  --  plomacy , of a sort . The distances be  --  tween the parties involved , however , were greatly reduced . Sometimes we would go to each other 's cabin and visit and talk . My cabin was called Red Oak . " Mr. Dayan grinned , as though relishing the name of his cabin . " The cabins were about twenty metres apart from each other , except for the cabins of Carter , Begin , and Sadat , which were a hit farther apart , but a cabin could hardly be seen from any other cabin , because of the hills and trees . Yet we were all very close to each oth  --  er . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did not care for all those hills and trees , " he said . " I prefer hav  --  ing vistas . Open spaces . Deserts . I like to he able to look out of the window and see long distances . This was a hit too closed in for me . " He laughed . " But the fresh air there was wonder  --  ful . So clean and clear . " " What was the Red Oak cabin like ? " we asked . " How many rooms ? " " Two bedrooms and a sitting room , with the television set in the sitting room , " he replied . " Of course , we were very short of space , so I had one bedroom ; Aharon Barak , who is short  --  ly to take his seat as a justice of the Supreme Court in Israel , had the other bedroom , sharing it with Meir Rosenne , legal adviser to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs ; and my aide , Eli Rubinstein , slept in the sitting room . I like to watch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so I had to come into the sitting room and disturb Eli , and when he wanted to use the bathroom he had to go through my room . Sometimes when I had to have a private meeting in the sitting room , I had to inconvenience Eli , and I always felt very bad about doing that . Finally , Eli gave up the sit  --  ting room and moved in with Barak and Rosenne . Barak is brilliant  --  very helpful , very valuable . He is planning to write a hook about the legal aspects of peacemaking , by the way , and Presi  --  dent Carter has offered to give him his own notes to use in the book . Barak was the tidiest one in our cabin . One day , I watched him tidying up and making things just so , and I said to him , ' I see you like things neat . ' And he said to me , ' Yes , and I do n't see anything wrong with that . ' " Mr. Da  --  yan laughed again . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked . " Any complaints ? " " No complaints , " Mr. Dayan said , reaching for another macaroon " We used a large , light , cheerful dining room in common . It was staffed by a number of Filipino men , who were very THE NEW YORKER accommodating . The food was too good . Marvellous pies and ice cream . Always a choice of meat or fish . And there were kosher meals for those who wanted them . It was all very informal . Egyptians or Americans would come and see an empty seat and ask , ' Do you mind if I join you ? ' And we did the same . President Sadat did not join the rest of us for meals . He usually ate in his cabin . But we ate with other Egyp  --  tians . Once , I had dinner alone with some of the Egyp  --  tian delegation . I had been meeting secretly with them for the past year . Now we were in the open , but when we met there was still something sur  --  reptitious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kosher food . ' Even if you 're Christian , kosher food is very good for you , ' he told them . On the first Friday of the conference , President and Mrs. Carter had dinner with the Israeli delegation . Every  --  body ate the kosher dinner , and afterward we sang He  --  brew folk songs . " We told Mr. Dayan that we had heard that some for  --  ty movies had been shown at Camp David during the course of the conference and asked him which ones he had seen . " None , " Mr. Dayan said , apologeti  --  cally . " Before we came to Camp Da  --  vid , the Americans asked us what lei  --  sure activities we wanted . Begin asked for movies . ' High Noon , ' in particular . Ezer Weizman , our Defense Minister , asked for billiards . Eli Rubinstein , a studious , single-minded , and Orthodox young man , who wears a yarmulke and eats only kosher food , learned to play billiards for the first time at the camp . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shown day and night , but I some  --  how could not get to see one . " In addition to the peace agreements , Mr. Dayan told us , he was bringing home a splendid navy-blue windbreak  --  er , with the Great Seal of the United States over the left breast and above it " Camp David " embossed in gold . " President Carter gave each of the principals at the conference such a jack  --  et , " Mr. Dayan said . " On the other hand , I gave each of the principals a copy of my new book , ' Living with the Bible . ' I started it as a book for children  --  for young people who had never smelled the rose of Sharon or climbed the paths of Mt . Carmel , so that they might know that these were the roses of the Bible and these were the hills of the shepherds  --  but it de  --  veloped into a book for adults . I wrote it because I felt a strong ongoing con  --  nection between my country , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my per  --  sonal life . Brzezinski was the only one at the camp , however , who had time to read my book . He told me that he had learned more about me from the book than he had learned about the Bible . " The waiter refilled Mr. Dayan 's cup with some fresh Sanka , and Mr. Dayan said thanks , gave him a boyish grin , and took a long sip from the cup . " You know , your President Carter was be  --  tween people all the time at Camp David , " he told us . " For example , at one point along the line I was going to have a meeting alone with President Sadat . So President Carter asked me to come to see him and advised me on how to get along with Sadat . He warned me not to talk about the agree  --  ments we were trying to work out , not to push . So I said , ' Fine . I will talk to him only about camels and deserts . ' Then , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sadat began to talk about the agreements . He also told me he knew of my great interest in archeology and antiquities . He knew that I had never been to Egypt except for the one time last year , right after Sadat came to Jerusalem , when I went to Ismailia . President Sadat said to me , I have some things at the Valley of the Kings in my country that you must see . But , Moshe , do n't pick anything and take it home with you . ' And I replied to him , ' That I can not promise . ' " He laughed again . Suddenly Mr. Dayan looked very serious and began to shake his head in wonder . " Altogether , it was the most important and impressive experience of my life , of all my sixty-three years , " lie said . " Here were three of the world leaders all together at one time , in one place , with one motivation . It was a high moment in history , with men , in  --  stead of using weapons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peace . "
