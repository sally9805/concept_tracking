While he was mulling over his options in Colorado last week , President Ford did not hesitate to use his veto power to knock down two energy-related bills passed by the outgoing 93rd Congress . Both bills , as Ford saw them , were at cross-purposes with the Administration 's goals for dealing with both the energy problem and inflation . <P> &gt; The most critical of Ford 's vetoes was his rejection of a strip-mining bill that the House and Senate had been struggling with for the past two years before coming to an agreement on a compromise version last month . Designed to protect Western states from strip mining , the bill required coal companies to restore mined land to its original contours and use , thereby limiting surface mining to areas where such reclamation was possible . Moreover , the bill would have extracted fees from the coal companies ( 35 per ton for surface mining , 25 per ton for underground mining ) to finance restoration of the more than 1 million acres torn up by strip miners . One probable effect of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of marginal surface mines in Appalachia . <P> Ford refused to sign the bill after arguing that it would have hampered domestic coal production " when the nation can ill afford significant losses from this critical energy source . " Though his veto was anticipated , it is sure to be unpopular . The strip-mining bill was supported by environmentalists , Ford 's own Interior Department , the AFL-CIO , the United Mine Workers , United Auto Workers and farm and ranch organizations . It was even backed by a few big coal companies that were anxious to have some law-any law-enacted to clear up the uncertainty that has clouded their future in strip mining . Congressional advocates of the bill , among them Washington Senator Henry Jackson , intend to try again . <P> &gt; Less widely disputed was the President 's pocket veto of the Energy Transportation Security Act . Backed by the politically powerful shipbuilders ' and seafarers ' unions , the bill provided that by 1977 , fully 30% of all oil imported into the U.S. would have to be carried on tankers built in American yards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imported in U.S.-registered tankers , which are considerably more costly to build and operate than most foreign-flag vessels . The bill would have increased federal subsidies to U.S. shipbuilders and operators , which now run to nearly $550 million annually , more than $800 million over the next five years .
