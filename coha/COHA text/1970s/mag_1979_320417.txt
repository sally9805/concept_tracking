Business as usual in Seoul <P> Once the initial shock of the assassination had passed and the period of national mourning was over , South Koreans made a surprising and pleasant discovery : the country was actually getting along quite well without the late President Park Chung Hee . " Why , it 's beautiful , " said a young schoolteacher , Kim Sung Ho . " Our country runs itself . " <P> Well , not quite . Still , Park had totally dominated the country for 18 years , and many citizens had feared his abrupt death would spell instant chaos . Yet there had been no panic , no runs on banks , no scrambles to hoard food . Instead , the prosperous capital city of Seoul ( pop . 8 million ) quickly pulsated back to normal life . The economy , despite 20% inflation , continued to chug along toward a record export target of $15.5 billion this year . <P> How to account for the country 's business-as-usual atmosphere ? Said the commander of U.S. forces in Korea , General John Wickham @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people . " A Korean business tycoon speculated : " With our TVs , refrigerators and all , so many of us now consider ourselves the middle class - the backbone of the country-that we knew we could n't afford to go to pieces over Mr. Park 's tragedy and possibly invite another North Korean invasion . " <P> Few were willing to express comparable confidence about the country 's political future . The question of succession was still unanswered . Acting President Choi Kyu Hah , 60 , plunged into interminable rounds of talks with military leaders and key ministers , reportedly in search of a succession formula . The two main contenders for the presidency , former Premiers Kim Jong Pil , 53 , and Chung II Kwon , 61 , were believed to be trying to drum up support , but thus far strictly behind the scenes . <P> At week 's end Choi announced that a presidential election would be held by next Jan. 26 , as provided by Park 's constitution . He added that the new President should then amend that constitution and call for fresh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sort of caretaker presidency , and some observers expected that he might choose to run . <P> The government 's numerous and conflicting stories about the assassination resembled a political drama concocted by the author of Rashomon . Last week martial law investigators issued what they called their " final " report . It concluded that Korean Central Intelligence Agency Director Kim Jae Kyu had killed Park because Kim had wild fantasies that he himself should be President . The report exonerated the military of any involvement in Kim 's coup attempt ; it also credited the martial law commander , Army Chief of Staff General Chung Seung Hwa , 53 , with foiling the plot by arresting Kim and the other murderers . The investigation was evidently continuing . The day after the report was issued , Kim was taken to the scene of the crime by his interrogators to reconstruct his actions .
