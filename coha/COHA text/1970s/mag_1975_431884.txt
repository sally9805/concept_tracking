 | The Shocking Thievery of MilitaryWeapon IN EARLY February 1973 , the Treasury Department 's Alcohol , ToJ. bacco and Firearms Unit ( ATF ) received a disturbing call from a soldier AWOL from Fort Hood , Texas . The GI said he was a member of a conspiracy plotting a series of terrorist murders with stolen Army machine guns . At the last moment , he had lost his nerve . Later , he led ATF agents to a cave in the Ozark Mountains of Arkansas , where they recovered a small arsenal of military weapons , including 30 M-16 automatic rifles . ? At 1:2o a.m. on February 9 , 1972 , Officer D. P. Bennett of the Washington , D.C. , police department challenged two suspiciouslooking men crossing a D.C. street . 92 A hail of shotgun and automaticrifle fire answered Bennett , who miraculously escaped injury . After a chase , police tracked the suspects to a hideout , where they arrested the pair and two others , and seized three M-14 automatic rifles and two shotguns , which were part of a number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Center 's arms vault . ? During the Fourth of July weekend last year , thieves using boltcutters and a high-speed drill broke into the arms vault of the National Guard armory in Compton , Calif. , and made off with enough arms to " equip an entire company of combat troops . " The haul : 96 M-16s , seven machine guns , eight gre- nade launchers ? plus thousands of rounds of ammunition and several cases of grenades . Police and FBI agents have not recovered the weapons and fear that they may be in the hands of extremists . These incidents ? and scores of similar episodes uncovered by The Reader 's Digest in a recent nationwide investigation ? typify a new and alarming criminal activity : the large-scale theft of weapons from U.S. military installations here and abroad by terrorists , gangs of professional thieves and unscrupulous arms merchants . For the most part , the Pentagon has kept secret from the public the scope of the menace and the types and numbers of weapons taken . In fact , because of loose record-keeping by the military @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost . Even when confronted with evidence , a Pentagon spokesman has said only , " We refuse to confirm or deny anything . " Privately , however , investigators of the Army 's Criminal Investigation Command ( CIDC ) concede that arms losses are enormous and have become a matter of the gravest concern . Indeed , last September , The Reader 's Digest obtained a confidential CIDC report which catalogued a staggering number of thefts that had occurred during just the past summer . So widespread has the traffic in looted weapons become ? one investigator estimates that there may be as many as 3000 M-16 rifles loose in America , 20,000 worldwide ? that FBI director Clarence Kelley reports that it is " of major concern to the FBI , to law enforcement in general and to the nation . " Kelley 's concern is echoed by police chiefs throughout the country . In Los Angeles , Chief Edward Davis has recommended to the city council that it petition Congress for a full-scale investigation . " Sophisticated military weapons , " said Chief Davis , " are appearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and paramilitary groups . " Minimum Security . What lies behind this epidemic of stolen arms ? Part of the problem is the sheer magnitude of the Pentagon 's arms logistics system . There are some 4300 state National Guard weapons sites in the United States alone . And the military services maintain 14 major weapons-supply centers and hundreds of bases and arms depots here and abroad . Even if it were possible to guard all of these all of the time , vast quantities of small arms and explosives are shipped without protection daily throughout the country in railway cars or trucks . Such laxity applies to far more sophisticated arms as well . For example , in late 1972 , five Redeye* surfaceto-air missiles were reported missing from the Army 's Red River Arsenal near Texarkana , Texas . FBI agents are even now investigating the frightening possibility that the rockets @#  | may have been stolen by terrorists . Moreover , the Army frequently awards weapons-hauling contracts to civilian longshoremen and truckers without even checking their reliability or record . No security background checks are made on such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ machine guns , grenades and automatic rifles do not fall within this category . Overseas , the situation is equally bad . Last August , the Army admitted the loss of 90 anti-tank rockets from an inadequately protected arms bunker in Miesau , Germany ? possibly to Middle East terrorists . Even earlier , the Army 's CIDC had been alarmed to discover that local bases had been hiring civilian employes ? including Syrian immigrants ? to perform guard duty at arms depots in Germany without adequate security screening . Significantly , when an International Telephone &; Telegraph Co. office in Nuremberg , Germany , was bombed by terrorists in November 1973 , it was discovered that the explosives were a plastique compound known as C-4 , which is used by U.S. Army demolition teams . Moreover , shreds of wrappings found at the scene enabled bomb experts to trace the C-4 to explosives shipped from a U.S. manufacturer to an Army depot in West Germany . Contraband Perils . In its secret report of last September , the Pentagon listed an astonishing number of weapons thefts and related incidents that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States . Here is a sampling : Item : Last August 31 , the National Guard armory at Salina , Kan. , was robbed of 20 M-16 automatic rifles . Item : On September 3 , approximately 420 pounds of military explosives were taken from a boxcar in a railroad yard in Leavittsburg , Ohio . Item : On September 14 , an enlisted man stationed at Fort Polk , La. , was approached by three men who offered him $25,000 to help them steal military weapons from the base arms vault . Fortunately , the soldier disclosed the scheme . The Pentagon report concluded with this unsettling note : " Forts Bliss , Benning and the Presidio , as well as National Guard armories in San Diego , Walnut Creek and Stockton , Calif. , have all been the targets of threats or overt acts possibly designed to test the security of these facilities . " Contributing to the problem is the fact that often the Army does n't even know that munitions are missing until they turn up in the hands of criminals . And then , in many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stolen weapons , fearing criticism or charges of lax security . For example , an M-60 machine gun stolen from the Oakland Army base seven years ago , and later recovered by police , rested unclaimed in the property vault of the Oakland police department , and was subsequently destroyed because the Army could not even find a record of its existence . Meanwhile , across the bay in 1975 THE SHOCKING THIEVERY OF MILITARY WEAPONS 95  | San Francisco , police are still attempting to find the party responsible for the theft of an anti-tank rocket which was used in 1971 by the terrorist Black Liberation Army in an attempt to destroy a police station . Investigators believe that the rocket was stolen from nearby Fort Ord , but Army officials there have continued to deny the missile 's loss . " Once a weapon leaves the manufacturer , " says a ranking U.S. Customs official in San Francisco , whose agency is investigating the rise in smuggled U.S. weapons , " it can not be traced past the military depot which received it . There is just no accountability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a partial accounting for the weapon , wide gaps in its history remain . Take , for example , the case of M-16 No. 129363 . On April 16 , 1974 , Berkeley and Oakland police raided a local Black Panther headquarters . Among the guns confiscated was an M-16 machine gun , serial No. 129363 . A trace of the weapon established that it had been manufactured in 1964 and sent to Eglin Air Force Base in Florida . Two years later , the weapon turned up in the illegal arsenal of a California gun collector . Typically , the Air Force had not reported the weapon missing . The recovered M-16 was then stored in an unprotected arms bunker at Fort Cronkite , near San Francisco . In 1969 , an audit revealed that M-16 No. 129363 was again missing ? and it was not found until the raid on the Panther headquarters . Police have no way of knowing how many ambushes or crimes the weapon figured in during that period . ATF investigators estimate that literally " tons of military explosives " have bee . stolen in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least a score of terrorist bombings have been carried out with pilfered C-4 plastique devices . Meanwhile , hand grenades have figured in an increasing number of terrorist attacks on police elsewhere in the United States . In fact , military grenades are so easily obtainable that they are selling on the street for as little as $40 apiece . Big-Money Bait . The availability of stolen U.S. arms has created a unique criminal market . American weapons smugglers are trading such munitions to foreign revolutionaries in return for cocaine or heroin . Agents of the Drug Enforcement Administration ( DEA ) disclose that in some areas along the U.S.-Mexico border it is now increasingly difficult to purchase drugs with cash . The payment instead : a stolen M-16 rifle or M-60 machine gun . So concerned is the Mexican government that , last March , its attorney general met with top U.S. officials to demand that immediate steps be taken to crack down on the traffickers . But the flow of weapons continues unabated . In July , for example , Mexican troopers closed in on revolutionaries near Guadalajara and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of U.S. military weapons , in- cluding mortars and machine guns . For illegal-arms smugglers and buyers alike , the profits can be enormous . While a stolen M-16 can be worth $500 on the American criminal market , it doubles in price when traded for dope below the border . And the dope in turn can bring the smuggler a 5000-percent profit when sold here . Meanwhile , a burgeoning nationwide market has developed in the sale of stolen spare parts for military weapons . They are sold openly at small gun shows around the country , even advertised in gun-trade periodicals . For example , last June one such publication , Shotgun News , advertised the availability of spare parts for M-16 automatic rifles . The Army rarely keeps track of such spare parts , many of which are sold unwittingly as scrap or pilfered from ordnance shops . Action Plan . What can be done to halt this traffic in stolen military hardware ? Here are suggestions : Increase security at armories . Fully a fifth of all arms vaults supervised by state National Guard units are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Guard spokesman said that the cost of providing armed sentries for armories on a 24-hour basis would be " devastating . " Nevertheless , last year , California Gov . Ronald Reagan , alarmed at the soaring arms thefts in his state , budgeted $874 , o ( 0 to beef up security . Other governors should follow suit . Improve procedures for weapons shipments . The Pentagon must examine the pedigrees of companies awarded contracts to haul its equipment . Moreover , special security measures should be taken on all weapons in transit , and careful background checks should be made on all civilians working at military arms-storage installations . Tighten accountability for ordnance . While the Department of Defense is currently instituting a computerized catalogue of weapons shipments by serial number , the sys tem is far from infallible . When arms are sent from manufacturers to depots and bases , it should be standard procedure to sight-inspect ? possibly by X ray ? all weapons containers to make sure that none of the contents listed are missing . MONTH after month , thefts from the military contribute to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kelley : " Such large amounts of looted weapons could serve as arsenals of destruction for both criminal bands and terrorists . We must take every precaution to ensure that such a potential tragedy is averted . " @#
