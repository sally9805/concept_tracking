As he snatches the deed to her home from the poor heroine , the movie villain always sneers that " it 's all perfectly legal . " In real life , eviction can be just as cruel . One spring day in 1972 when some prospective buyers stopped by , Lillian K. Ware , 58 , a black private nurse , learned for the first time that she no longer owned her $25,000 home in Evanston , Ill. ; the title had been taken over some months before by a local real estate speculator . Barring some legal miracle , Mrs. Ware 's subsequent two-year court battle against tough lawyers and a notably harsh Illinois tax-delinquency law will end this week , when she is forced to leave the home in which she has lived for 24 years . The reason : she neglected to pay a 1968 tax bill that came to all of $41.57 . <P> The villain in Mrs. Ware 's case is a tax law enacted by the Illinois legislature two decades ago . Drafted with the help of real estate operators , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bill-if the owner does not respond to a warning notice within three weeks . The buyer of the overdue bill can take full title to the property two years later-again , after giving notice - if the owner has paid no part of the taxes or the interest . Ostensibly , the law is meant to provide an incentive for private enforcement of property taxes . Indeed , the rate of Illinois property-tax delinquencies has dropped from 33% to 3% . But the law has also proved to be highly profitable for professional speculators , who buy up tax bills in the hope they will get at least a few properties for next to nothing . <P> One such speculator , Chicago Attorney David R. Gray , bought Mrs. Ware 's $41.57 bill-the last of ten annual installments on a special assessment for the paving of an alley behind her home . There is significant doubt about Mrs. Ware 's claim that she was never notified by Gray that she owed him the taxes . But her lawyers have pointed out that in 1968 , when she was hospitalized with a heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tax liabilities ; he found a $500 debt for general taxes , which was promptly paid , and he missed the paving-assessment installment . <P> When she learned the trouble she was in , Mrs. Ware offered to pay the tax - plus interest and penalties . Gray was not interested . The case has been up to both the Illinois and U.S. Supreme Courts , but almost every judge has seemed satisfied that a speculator can indeed get a $25,000 home for $41.57 in unpaid taxes , evict the owner and sell it for all he can . In Illinois , that is-as they say in the movies-perfectly legal .
