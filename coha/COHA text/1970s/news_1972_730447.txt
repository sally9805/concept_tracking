txt Congress has begun to probe alleged profiteering in the U.S.-Soviet grain deal , as prospects widen for vastly increased trade between the two world giants . Critics charge that the Nixon administration connived with big U.S. grain exporters to assure them a handsome profit on the sale of 400 million bushels of wheat to the Soviet Union , at the expense of wheat farmers and taxpayers . Secretary of Agriculture Earl L. Butz , who earlier had branded the charges a " political snipe hunt , " told Congress that the huge grain sale to the Soviets " is good for all citizens . " " It is a major contribution , " Mr. Butz told a House agriculture subcommittee , " to better commercial and political relations between two powerful nations . " Huge sales reported There have been reports that grain-exportIng  --  corporations ,  - -  with- advance - knowledge that the Soviet deal was pending , bought huge amounts of wheat at low prices from farmers in Texas , Oklahoma , and Kansas , who were unaware that Moscow was negotiating to buy . // *Grain probe trails @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high as 47 cents a bushel ? the difference between the low sale price guaranteed to Moscow and the domestic U.S. wheat price , which has soared since disclosure of the Soviet deal . Meanwhile , the White House announced that Henry A. Kissinger , Mr. Nixon 's peripatetic foreign-affairs adviser , had made " significant progress " on a number of issues involved in negotiating an overall U.S.-Soviet trade agreement . The announcement said that officials of the two countries would meet in Washington this month , for further discussion of Moscow 's outstanding lend-lease debt and other matters . Trade pact sought The aim would be to sign a trade agreement in the near future . Publicly , President Nixon has said he hopes for a trade pact with the Soviets by the end of this year . The White House also anticipated the " prompt " conclusion of a maritime agreement , assigning grain cargoes to Soviet , American , and third-country ships . The projected trade agreement , on which Commerce Secretary Peter G. Peterson and other U.S. officials have done spadework , would lay the foundation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Agriculture Department announced in Washington that about 15 million bushels of wheat have been sold to Communist China . The figure derived from export-subsidy applications received from U.S. grain exporters , who handled the transactions . Emerging from all this is clear evidence that the United States is broadening significantly its trade with the two Communist giants . This should help to reduce the overall U.S. trade deficit , which totaled $2 billion in the second quarter of 1972 . Explaining to do Equally clear , however , is that Mr. Butz has some explaining to do , to square his assertion of benefit to " all citizens " with the known fallout from the huge Soviet wheat deal . This is the scenario , as developed by critics including Sen. George McGovern , a number of congressmen , and groups representing American wheat farmers and consumers . On July 8 the White House announced the " largest agricultural transaction in history " ? the sale to the Soviet Union of $750 million worth of American wheat and feed grains over a three-year period . A line of credit , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was extended to the Soviets , who also were guaranteed delivery at a low world-market price , reportedly $1.63 a bushel . Several large U.S. grain-exporting companies , allegedly with advance knowledge of what was going on , already had bought up American winter wheat from farmers , who sold their crop at about $1.32 a bushel . When the White House announced the grain sales ? which later expanded even beyond the official announcement ? the domestic wheat price in the United States began to climb , reaching as high as $2.10 a bushel . The world price also edged upward to $1.69 . But the Agriculture Department said it would continue to pay a 47-cents-a-bushel subsidy  --  the difference between the Soviet-guaranteed price of $1.63 and the $2.10 domestic market price ? for a one-week period , from Aug. 25 until Sept. 1 . Administration critics charge that exporters during that week applied for 47-cent subsidies on 280 million bushels of wheat , amounting to $131.6 million . .
