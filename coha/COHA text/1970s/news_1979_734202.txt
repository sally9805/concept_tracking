txt Get off the elevator on the 39th floor of the Mellon Bank building here and you 'll see two suites of offices fronted by sliding glass doors  --  the kind that are controlled from the inside . The offices are those of Richard K. Mellon &; Sons , where the affairs of heirs of the late and very wealthy grandson of Thomas Mellon are managed . It 's a quiet place ; there are no jangling telephones , no secretaries rushing around carrying papers . The sound of what activity does go on is muffled by thick carpeting . The overall effect is that of a luxurious urban apartment , not a business office . Any " stranger " who enters is asked if he has an appointment . If he does n't , he is This is the third of a series of stories about the present-day members of some of America 's great families . turned away politely but firmly by a male receptionist . Chances are he wo n't be back . Appointments are difficult to get . " Why should we ( discuss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the suave , 71-year-old Virginia resident who is the richest individual member of the family . " We are n't running for office . " That 's the way it usually has been with the Mellons , whose immense fortune long has been one of the quietest in the U.S. as well as one of the largest . The Mellon money is based on such " smokestack " industnes as oil refining , aluminum refining and fabricating and the manufacture of industrial equipment , but the Mellons have always kept in the background and left it to others to keep those smokestacks going . Thomas Mellon , the dour Irish Protestant lawyer who started the family on its way to wealth , was an investor in real estate and , later , a banker . His sons greatly expanded what he left them by making loans to new enterprises in exchange for sizable but nonmanaging ownership interests . Among those were loans to concerns that were to become Gulf Oil Corp .. Aluminum Co. of America , and Koppers Co . The family philosophy was best enunciated by Richard King Mellon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did for a living he once replied : " I hire company presidents . " By all accounts , this can not be said of the present-day Mellons . There are more of them than there used to be  --  some 80 in all ? and they have n't had a recognized leader since R.K. died . The exercise of the rights that go with their corporate holdings has become even more indirect than previously , accomplished mostly by non-family representatives on the boards of companies in which they own stock . The Wealth-Preservation Business The family 's combined fortune is estimated at $5 billion , but that 's just a guess , it 's dispersed among a host of private holding companies , trusts and charitable foundations , and it 's likely that no one knows its true worth for sure . But what is perhaps most remarkable about the Mellon fortune is that it 's still formidable despite several scrapes with potentially large inheritance taxes . Today , the Mellons are mainly in the business of staying rich , and by most indications they have succeeded quite well . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the effects of the progressively stiffer inheritance taxes adopted by U.S. Congresses over the years can be eased by a variety of methods , many of which the Mellons have employed . That 's what the holding companies , trusts and foundations are all about . " There are still opportunities to take advantage of the tax laws , " says Michael Graetz , a professor at Harvard Law School . " There have been enough gaps over the years that the estate tax has n't inhibited anyone from passing on great amounts of wealth if they do sophisticated tax planning . " A Simple Document Take , for example , the will of R. K. Mellon . A simple document of less than 30 pages , it left half his estate to his wife , Constance , and the other half to the Richard King Mellon Foundation , a charitable institution with a variety of purposes . Neither bequest was subject to federal taxes ; a widow can inherit half her husband 's estate tax-free , and the same status is accorded grants to charitable institutions that meet government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tax laws , most of today 's big U.S. charitable foundations would n't exist . Bequests to a foundation usually entail a sell-off of stock or other assets , but if the institution is controlled by family members , as is the Mellon unit , the family still can decide how the money will be spent . " If you equate the control of wealth with power , then a bequest to a family charity leaves the family with a hell of a lot of power , " notes one tax attorney . The Richard K. Mellon firm appears to be another example of tax planning , accountants say . They explain that the real value of the shares of such a closely held concern may be very high , but their potential sale price , on which taxes are based , might be much lower because of the difficulty a minority-Interest buyer would have in exercising any control over his purchase . Finally , tax experts agree that Mr. Mellon 's estate probably did n't contain all or even most of his large but publicly unevaluated fortune . They say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in gifts to his four adopted children before his death . Pnor to the passage of the Tax Reform Act of 1976 , such gifts were taxed at a maximum rate of 57% compared with the maximum Inheritance-tax rate of 70% . Now , the 70% rate applies to both . To be sure , it is becoming increasingly difficult for rich people to protect their estates from taxes ; so far-reaching were the changes embodied in the 1976 law that Warren Shine , a tax expert with the New Yorkbased accounting firm of Ernst &; Ernst , believes the law " spells the death of the great family fortunes . " But that death will be a slow one , because Richard King Mellon and other oldergeneration members of the family  --  like other nch people  --  surely set up trusts before 1976 that will benefit their children and grandchildren for many years to come . And . of course , they can afford the best tax advice . Indeed , if heredity means anything , the Mellons ' millions probably will last longer than most . Thomas Mellon was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buying property in and around Pittsburgh from distressed estates . It made him wealthy enough to open his own bank , T. Mellon &; Sons , in 1870 , just in time to take advantage of the industrial boom spurred by Pittsburgh 's easy access to coal , iron ore and water transportation . It was at the bank that Thomas 's two youngest ( of four ) sons . Andrew W. and Richard B. , gained the experience that was to place them among the nation 's leading financiers . The brothers formed the basis of their fabulous fortune between 1889 and 1915 by lending money to risky but promising new ventures . Low Profile A $25.000 loan to an outfit called Pittsburgh Reduction Co. led to a substantial interest in what now is Alcoa . A grubstake to the J.M. Guffey Co .. a Texas oil wildcatter , earned the family a prominent position in the present , giant Gulf Oil Corp . A loan to finance the commercial production of silicon carbide , an abrasive used to shape steel , became an interest in Carborundum Co. , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Heinrich Koppers , a cokeoven manufacturer , resulted in a large piece of Koppers Co . During that same period , the Mellon brothers formed another bank , Union Trust , which later was merged into T. Mellon &; Sons to become the present Mellon Bank N.A. , the nation 's 17th-largest bank . It was also then that the family 's behindthe-scenes ownership style was established . Andrew W. Mellon , who became the most famous Mellon of all , served as Secretary of the Treasury between 1921 and 1932 , but when his name was first proposed for the post President Harding reportedly had never heard of him , even though Mr. Mellon sat on some 60 corporate boards . ( Once in public life , of course , Mr. Mellon could lie low no longer . Early in his term he was praised as " the greatest Secretary of the Treasury since Hamilton " for reducing the U.S. war debt . Later , when the economy turned sour , his policies were given much of the blame for the 1930s Depression . ) About 40 years ago , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large , amounting to 70% of Gulf Oil 's stock and 35% of Alcoa 's . Sell-offs for taxes and other reasons have diluted those proportions considerably over the years , but the Mellons still are represented in many of them and , of course , the concerns are much larger and more valuable than they once were . Pinpointing the family 's present stockholdings is difficult because of its size and the existence of so many indirect ownership forms . But as best as can be determined , it owns at least 16% of Gulf Oil common ; 15.3% of Mellon National Corp. , the holding company for the Mellon bank ; 5.6% of Koppers , and 2.5% of Alcoa . At current market prices , its common stock in those four concerns alone is worth more than SI billion and produced almost $70 million in dividends last year The family holds the preferred stock and bonds of some of its companies , and has good-sized additional ownership stakes in such other corporations as First Boston Corp .. a New York investment-banking concern ; Ampex Corp. , which makes audio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several mammoth and widely diversified portfolios of other stocks , and the ownership of a lot of land . Interlocking Directorships Executives of the companies in which the Mellons have sizable chunks say that close family involvement in their affairs has all but ended since R.K. 's death . Paul Mellon , the dominant family member today , decided early on that he was n't interested in business , he devotes himself to collecting art , minding his charities and raising racehorses on his Virginia farm . Yet evidence of Mellon influence still is seen in a number of ways . One is in the interlocking directorships that link the family 's " Big Four " companies of Mellon National , Gulf , Alcoa and Koppers . Nathan Pearson . Paul Mellon 's personal representative , sits on all four boards . Andrew W. Mathieson , who represents R.K. 's heirs , is on the boards of the bank , Gulf and Koppers Also on the Gulf board is family member James Mellon Walton and Mellon National Chairman James H Higgins . The Alcoa board includes E. D. Brockett , Gulf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the bank , and Paul L. Miller , senior adviser to First Boston Corp . Koppers ' directors include Mellon Bank President Curtis E. Jones . On the bank board is Fletcher L. Byrom , Koppers ' chairman ; Jerry , chairman of Gulf ; W. H. Krome George , chairman of Alcoa , and family member Seward Prosser Mellon . And so on . Another indication of Mellon influence is in the physical proximity of the headquarters of the " Big Four " companies in downtown Pittsburgh ; all are within a few blocks of one another . Gulf in particular probably would have moved to Texas or New York long ago if it were n't for the Mellons , people in Pittsburgh believe . And sometimes , when things get sticky , Mellon " clout " is exerted over particular policy issues at companies in which they have a stake . Such apparently was the case in 1976 , when Gulf Chairman Bob R. Dorsey and three other high-ranking executives were ousted after the disclosure that the company had channeled millions of dollars Into illegal contributions to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Directors According to accounts of the meeting at which the dismissals were decided , " Mellon directors " and their allies on the Gulf board formed a majority that resisted attempts of other directors to retain Mr. Dorsey . At the same time , however , observers of the company point out that family representatives did n't take the initiative in exposing Gulf 's political " slush fund " and acted only after the federal government filed a lawsuit attacking it . " If R.K. had been around ... there would have been new management ( at Gulf ) in 1973 or 1974 , " when the existence of the fund first came to light , one Gulf insider said . The Mellon rule today seems to be to sit tight and leave their companies alone as long as things are going smoothly , and to give most of their attention to the philanthropies their incomes support . Among the foremost of these is Carnegie-Mellon University in Pittsburgh and the National Gallery of Art in Washington , which was established by Andrew W. Mellon and to which Paul , his sister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last year at a cost of nearly $100 million . The Mellons who are interested in business prefer to skirt the huge , bureaucratized companies their ancestors ' money started and try their hand at smaller enterprises on which they can make their own mark . One of the most aggressive Is 46-year-old Richard M. Scaife , R.K. 's nephew . In 1969 , he bought the Greensburg ( Pa . ) Tribune-Review newspaper for $5 million , and has since started a city magazine called Pittsburgher and bought a chain of small California newspapers . He is said to be looking to take over larger publications as well . Paul Mellon 's son , Timothy , also is an entrepreneur . He set up his own computer consulting company several years ago and recently formed a concern that specializes in a new method of preserving wood for railroad ties , according to his father . Paul Mellon agrees that the family fortune his father and grandfather built probably is doomed to eventual extinction because of taxes , but he takes wry pleasure in his son 's new endeavor . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ railroads may make a great comeback and Timmy 's business will take off . "
