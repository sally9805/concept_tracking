This book can not now be published in our homeland except in Samizdat* because of objections by censors that are inconceivable to the normal human mind and also because it would be necessary to write the word God in lowercase . I can not bow down to such a humiliation . <P> So writes Nobel-prizewinning Novelist Alexander Solzhenitsyn in a postscript to his new novel , August 1914 , which was published last week in Russian by the small YMCA Press in Paris . It is the only one of his books , aside from One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich , that Solzhenitsyn has agreed to have published in the West . <P> Ever since he completed August 1914 in October 1970 , Solzhenitsyn has been trying to have it published in the Soviet Union . Despite the fact that all his major works except One Day have been banned in Russia , he felt that there was some hope for the new novel ; unlike the other books , it does not center on the crimes of Stalinism , which by implication embarrass Soviet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nonetheless , Soviet censors raised many objections . They even insisted , as Solzhenitsyn points out in the postscript , that the word God be printed in lowercase but that KGB ( the secret police ) be printed in capitals . <P> When Solzhenitsyn learned that a copy of the novel had made its way to the West , he got in touch with his Zurich lawyer , Fritz Heeb . He wanted to avoid what had happened to his other books : Western publishers scrambled to print competing editions , often in execrable translations . To establish copyright in Solzhenitsyn 's name in France , Heeb quietly authorized the small YMCA Press ( so named because it was founded by a member of the association , Dr. John Mott , in 1921 ) to publish August 1914 in Russian . <P> Veiled Criticism . The novel is the first part of a trilogy on a subject that has haunted Solzhenitsyn all his life : Russia 's role in the war against Germany in 1914 . The work is intended as a memorial to his father , an artillery officer in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tannenberg in East Prussia in August 1914 . As an artillery captain in World War II , Solzhenitsyn passed through Tannenberg , but he was not around to savor the eventual Russian victory . In February 1945 , Solzhenitsyn was arrested for writing barely veiled criticism of Stalin in letters to a friend , and sentenced to eight years ' imprisonment . During that time , he developed and overcame cancer . Solzhenitsyn 's greatest fear is that he will be prevented from finishing the trilogy-either by a recurrence of cancer or by the Soviet authorities . <P> Even as Solzhenitsyn 's latest book appeared in the West , another Russian writer , imprisoned for publishing articles and stories abroad ( On Socialist Realism , The Trial Begins ) , was released from a Soviet labor camp . In late 1966 , Andrei Sinyavsky , now 46 , was sentenced to seven years at hard labor for " anti-Soviet slander , " while Fellow Writer Yuli Daniel was given five years on the same charge . Daniel was released last year after serving his full sentence , but Sinyavsky was set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he was banned for two more years from returning to Moscow , <P> <P> *Literally , self-publishing-the clandestine retyping and circulation of forbidden literary documents .
