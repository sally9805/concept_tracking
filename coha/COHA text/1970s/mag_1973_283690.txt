It is an American trait-perhaps the American trait-to anticipate the future with optimism , but as 1973 drew to a close much of that confidence was ebbing , drained by a series of worries that seemed to stretch ahead indefinitely . <P> Worries about the two Big E 's : the economy and energy . Worries about the Middle East , about relations with the Japanese and the Europeans , to say nothing of maintaining the shaky detente with the Russians . Worry , in the light of Watergate , about the wonderfully delicate system of American government . Can something designed in the 18th century , the century of reason , cope with the large and complex problems of today ? <P> At a holiday party in Los Angeles , a self-styled expert was holding forth about how these problems will hang on for years . Listening to the lament , a woman in her 40s rolled her eyes to the ceiling and walked away . " One year at a time , " she said . " At this rate , one year at a time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each year is becoming a job to handle : 1974 is likely to be just as explosive as 1973 . The issues that have been raised this year will have to be grappled with during the next twelve months . The way that they are handled - or mishandled-will deeply affect American politics and pocketbooks . <P> Watergate will certainly not die down in 1974 . Starting in January , three grand juries , which are considering evidence presented by Special Prosecutor Leon Jaworski , are expected to issue indictments in the scandals of the milk producers ' contributions to the Nixon campaign , the handling of the ITT antitrust case and the work of the White House plumbers . Egil Krogh , boss of the plumbers , has promised to tell all that he knows after he is sentenced in January-and he knows plenty . Former Cabinet Members John Mitchell and Maurice Stans are scheduled to go on trial Jan. 9 on charges stemming from $200,000 in illegal campaign contributions by Robert Vesco , the accused swindler . And John Dean , the former White House counsel , is waiting to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ervin ( see story page 13 ) will resume his Watergate committee hearings next month , putting on display witnesses who will testify about the Administration 's role in the milk deal and the curious $100,000 campaign contribution from Howard Hughes that Bebe Rebozo kept in that safe-deposit box . <P> Most important , the House Judiciary Committee will start considering the historic question of whether or not to impeach the President . To Senate Minority Leader Hugh Scott , everything in 1974 will hinge on how the President finally emerges from the maelstrom of Watergate . What is at stake is his ability - and the ability of the entire Administration-to deal effectively with all the other major issues of the year . Unless Nixon is completely cleared and regains his former clout , or is succeeded by Vice President Gerald Ford , the presidency may turn into a form of regency . Several strong men will use highly independent power : Henry Kissinger in foreign affairs , George Shultz in the economy , William Simon in energy and James Schlesinger in defense .        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
