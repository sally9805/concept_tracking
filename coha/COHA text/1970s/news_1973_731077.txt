txt The Saxbe nomination is in surprising trouble . The difficulty has nothing to do with the caliber of the junior Senator from Ohio , William B. Saxbe It 's generally agreed he 's qualified to be the new attorney general , a post to which President Nixon has nominated him . He is able , principled , and independent in thought and action , say his colleagues in the Senate . And popular ? they 'd be inclined to vote to confirm his appointment . But perhaps they wo n't . The reason is a little-known provision of the Constitution . Some members of the Senate Judiciary Committee , now holding hearings on the Saxbe nomination , say this provision makes his nomination unconstitutional . Sens . Sam J. Ervin Jr . ( D ) of North Carolina and Robert C. Byrd ( D ) of West Virginia have said so publicly ; others have said it privately . That is the Saxbe difficulty , as four law- school professors testify at Monday 's opening of Judiciary Committee hearings on the nomination . Pay raise crucial The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Congress may accept another government position if , while he was a legislator , Congress raised the position 's salary . Since Mr. Saxbe has been a Senator , Congress raised from $35,000 to $42,000 the salary of the attorney general and other Cabinet members . The Nixon administration has introduced a bill to roll back this salary of the attorney general to $35,000 . It feels such actibn would comply with the spirit of the constitutional provision . // *Nominee Saxbe hits hurdle // But some in Congress do not agree . Sen. William Proxmire ( D ) of Wisconsin says constitutional authorities hold that Mr. Saxbe can not take office constitutionally ? " the Constitution'g clear on it . " Appearing on CBS 's " Face the Nation , " Senator Proxmire said " It 's a mechanical application of the Constitution , such as you have to be 35 years old to be president or 30 years old to be a Senator . " Stand spelled out Senator Proxmire said constitutional experts insist " it 's very clear that you can not hold that office if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and no subsequent action can eliminate that or wipe it out . " This is the position that constitutional authorities planned to take in testimony before the judiciary committee , he said . The constitutional provision at issue is Paragraph 2 of Section 6 , of the first Article of the Constitution . It reads : " No senator or representative shall , during the time for which he was elected , be appointed to any civil office under the authority of the United States , which shall have been created , or the emoluments whereof shall have been increased during such time . . . . " Warning of reversal If an attorney general is appointed unconstitutionally , some senators are warning , all his department 's subsequent anticrime action might be reversed by court appeal . The Senate Judiciary Committee now is holding hearings on the proposal to roll back the attorney general 's salary . The Saxbe nomination , announced two weeks ago by President Nixon , has not officially been submitted to the Senate for confirmation . The Nixon administration is waiting for passage first of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear the way for Senate approval of Mr. Saxbe . Now it appears that what once was considred likely to gain routine approval ? the rollback bill ? faces tough sledding in the committee . With that prospect , clouds begin to gather above the Saxbe nomination itself .
