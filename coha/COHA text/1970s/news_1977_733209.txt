txt Two middleaged Baltimore men , one a construction worker , the other a merchant seaman , hurt their backs in accidents a couple of years ago . Both had worked quite steadily all their adult lives but , because of their backs , they say that they can no longer hold jobs . The seaman now receives more than $200 a month in disability payments through the Social Security System . The construction worker applied for disability benefits and was turned down . Such apparent inequities are not uncommon . The Social Security disability program has become , in the view of its critics , the most arbitrary of the Government 's programs to help the needy , one in which poor people in similar circumstances often . receive vastly different treatment . It has also grown in the last 20 years from a modest effort to help Americans who had to quit work because of injury or illness into one of the Government 's biggest and least understood public assistance programs . Budget officials are disturbed because , unless the law is changed , the Social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , will run out of money late next year . The Government 's actuaries are confounded because over the years they vastly underestimated the growth in the program . They have little confidence that their current projections will prove to be any more reliable . Federal judges are concerned because the courts are becoming overburdened by disability cases . The number of suits filed against the Government over disability claims has more than doubled in the last four years and is expected to continue to grow at a rate of more than 25 percent a year . Social Security administrators are worried because , as often as not , the decisions of Government examiners in disability cases are overturned on appeal . And , perhaps the most sensitive point of all , millions of Americans are frustrated and many are impoverished because the Social Security Administration , following a procedure that often seems capricious , has rejected their requests for assistance . In theory , the Social Security disability program is not a welfare program but an insurance system . The vast majority of American workers , more than 100 million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their paychecks . A Separate Reserve Fund Most of the money goes into the familiar Social Security Retirement System . But $1.15 out of every $100 earned , divided equally between the employer and the employee , is put into a separate reserve fund to protect the worker if he or she should become disabled and unable to work before reaching age 65 . Those who receive disability payments are generally among the most underprivileged people in society . Typically . they are in their 50's. have worked in the lowest-paid , most insecure jobs , have never earned much more than a poverty wage and have but an eighth-grade or ninth-grade education . To be eligible , a person over 30 must have worked and paid Social Security taxes for at least five of the last 10 years before becoming disabled . Fewer years of coverage are required for younger workers . Benefits are based on a worker 's average earnings during his working years . Because of inflation . the average wage of a worker tends to be higher the younger he or she is , and that has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To illustrate this , one expert took the hypothetical case of a father , age 55 , and his son , 25 , both of whom had worked all their adult jives at the maximum in- , come for which Social Security taxes are paid  --  it has risen since 1951 from $3,600 to $16,500 . Both became disabled on the same day in February 1976 , The son , it was pointed out , would be eligible for $515 a month if he were single and $901 if he had a family to support . The father would be entitled to only $356 if he were single and $639 if he had a family . Definition of ' Disabled ' The definition of " disabled " has created , in the view of the program 's critics , even more serious inequities . To be declared disabled under the law , a person must be unable to engage in any " substantial gainful activity " because of a medically determinable physical or mental impairment that has lasted or is expected to last at least a year or result in death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A person IF either disabled or not , and Social Security official 's acknowledge that the rigid , yet imprecise wording of the law leads to highly subjective judgments . Take the case of the two Baltimore men . Howard Barnes , 44 years old , with a wife and six children , was a cement layer by trade , and when that kind of work was not available , he did other heavy labor . He earned $200 , sometimes $250. a week , and that was enough to support his family . One day twe years ago , working in a basement , he lifted a heavy concrete block , and his back went out . One doctor said that he had a slipped disk . Another thought he had a fracture . Still another said that he had a degenerative spinal disease . Mr. Barnes , who had done construction work since he left school in the eighth , grade , knows only that the pain is always there , and that he has been unable I to work since that day in the basement . For the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Social Security offices , trying to collect disability benefits . Over and over , he has been turned down . A Government vocational expert suggested that he become a " canteen attendant . " a " chauffeur-messenger " or an " office aide , " but Mr. Barnes has never done that kind of work , and he can not find a job . " I 've always had a strong back , " he says . " I 've always earned my living with my back , I do n't know how to do anything else . " Rejection Is Overruled The merchant seaman , who is 51 years old , hurt his back in a shipboard accident about the same time Mr. Barnes hurt his . The seaman , who asked that his name not be used for fear that that would lead to a review of his case , was also initially turned down for disability payments . His case was reconsidered , and he was rejected again . But when he took his case before an administrative law judge , the previous examiners were overruled . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in benefits . The injuries in the two cases appear to be similar . Both men are ambulatory . The former seaman manages to tend an acre-and-a-half flower garden . Both men complain of severe back pain that prevents them from doing heavy labor . One difference in the cases is that the seaman sought help from a Legal Aid lawyer early in the appeals process . Mr. Barnes did not engage a lawyer until he sued in Federal Court , where his case is now pending . Government statistics show that an applicant claiming disability is three times more likely to win an award if he has a lawyer than if he does not . Dennis M. Sweeney , chief attorney at the Legal Aid Bureau in Baltimore , who now represents both men , says that disability cases are " like playing Russian roulette . ' " I 'd hate to have anything I value depend on my ability to predict the outcome of a disability claim , " says Mr. Sweeney , who has handled 500 such cases in the last several years . Predictions Not Possible Robert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for nine years and how heads the office on M Street here in Washington , says that he has seen thousands of applications over the years and still can not tell which will be successful and which will not . State vocational agencies are employed by the Social Security Administration to review medical records and determine if applicants for disability insurance are really disabled . Studies show that the standards vary enormously from state to state . Last year , the General Accounting Office , which conducts investigations for Catgress , selected at random 221 claims that had been adjudicated by one state agency and submitted the claim files to agencies in 10 different states to see if they would have decided the cases the same way . ? There was complete agreement among the 11 states on only 48 of the cases . In only 119 of the cases did six or more states agree on one of the three possible Options : to accept the claim , reject it or ask for more data . Finally . in 95 of the 119 cases in which six " or more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rationale for the decision . The Accounting Office criticized the Social Security Administration for not providing clear criteria on which the stale agencies could base decisions , for failing to provide uniform training for adjudicators and for not carefully monitoring the entire procedure . James B. Cardwell . Commissioner of Social Security , conceded recently that " undoubtedly , some individuals in like circumstances are treated inconsistently under the present rules and under the present administrative techniques . " He said that " given the subjective nature of the process , this is probably unavoidable to some extent . " Within the Government , a solution to the system 's budgetary problems is viewed as the most urgent matter . The number of people receiving disability insurance payments has risen dramatically in the last decade , from 1.9 million people at the end of 1966 to 4.7 million people at the end of last year . In 1965 , IS persons were receiving benefits for every 1,000 covered workers , There are now 31.3 beneficiaries for every 1,000 workers . The cost of the program is nearly five times what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fund is being rapidly depleted . Last year . the fund collected $7.8 billion in taxes and paid out $9.2 billion in benefits . ' Without changes in the law , the fund will run dry late next year . President Carter , as part of his overall proposal to revise the financing of the Social Secu : its ' System , has recommended that funds be transferred from the retirement fund to the disability fund to make up the latter 's deficit . There is broad support for such legislation in Congress , and it is likely to be enacted . New Definition Sought However , the President proposed little to remedy the inequities in the disability system . Representative James A. Burke , Democrat of Massachusetts , who is the chairman of the House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Social Security , has offered legislation that would alter the definition of disability and change some of the procedures , - with a view to making the system more fair . In any event , it is not at all clear that a legislative solution to the problem of inequities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simple , " says Prof. Monroe Berkowitz , a Rutgers economist who specializes in Social Security matters . " I do n't know if there is anything Congress can do . " There is no conclusive answer to the question of why the disability program has expanded at such a rate , when there is no evidence that the proportion of workers who are disabled has increased . One factor seems to be that the sagging economy resulted in workers with borderline disabilities being laid off and applying for disability payments . Another is the fact that changes in the law in the last decade have made benefits more attractive . Many students of the subject believe that the main element may be what Mr. Caldwell. the Social Security Commissioner . calls " a change in public attitude generally about Government benefits . " Professor Berkowitz subscribes to that view . " To be disabled , " he says , " has become a socially acceptable role . "
