The common people of China are a strong , hardy race , patient , industrious and much given to traffic and all the arts of gain , cheerful and loquacious under the severest labor . <P> - Lord Macartney , 1794 <P> THAT shrewd comment by England 's first envoy to Imperial China remains accurate to this day . China has long been compared , invidiously , to a colony of human ants . The fact is that the devotion to hard labor noted by Macartney is still the nation 's most conspicuous characteristic . If the thoughts of Chairman Mao Tse-tung could ever be boiled down to two words , they might plausibly be " work harder . " <P> <P> The emphasis on the work ethic points up one of the key realities of life in the land of Mao . Despite the social upheaval created by the revolution , there still is much of the old Middle Kingdom in China today . Although Mandarin is established as the official language , the nation 's 50 major dialects and more than 1,000 variants persist in daily use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pleasure of the table ; most foreign visitors return home several pounds heavier , spouting memories of exquisite meals . Women have been officially liberated , and are equal before the law with men ; yet some marriages are still formally arranged . Young people as well as old visit burial places in rites of homage to their ancestors . <P> Westerners who remember the pre-1949 China , however , have been almost euphorically impressed by the transformation that Communism has achieved . The people , visitors note , appear happy , relaxed and well fed . Markets and department stores are well stocked , although the prices of luxury items are almost prohibitive : a good camera , for example , costs $80 . City streets are clean and orderly , and traffic jams are created by bicycles rather than cars . There is no litter , no beggars , no prostitution , no drug addiction , no alcoholism . Almost everyone wears drab , heavy-duty work clothes-children , however , are gaily and colorfully dressed-but there is no sense of utter poverty . Instead , workers and peasants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his works , and convey a sense of happy participation in their society . Prof. Victor Sidel , of the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York , was favorably impressed by the quality of Chinese medicine on his trip last September : " I 'm tempted to say , ' I 've seen the future and it works . ' " <P> However pleasing its surface appears , China 's " future " is one that most Americans would find intolerable . Party control of thought and intellectual life is total . Virtually everyone works an average ten hours a day , six days a week , and sometimes the seventh day is taken up with obligatory lectures and self-study sessions . Until last December , not a single new literary work of any kind other than a few poems or short stories eulogizing Mao had been published in China for nearly five years . Operas , films and drama are all propaganda pieces of socialist realism . Life in China may be stable and secure-but it is also , from a Western viewpoint , almost unbearably confined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
