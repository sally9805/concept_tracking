The time of the play is several presidential elections hence . The stage is bare , dimly and coldly lit . The sound of bombardment , near and distant . Sudden flashes of light in sync with bombardment . LIEUTENANT CUTLER and an aide charge across stage . A burst of machine-gun fire and the aide staggers and falls . LIEUTENANT CUTLER drops , and cautiously inches forward . COLONEL DAWN enters , crawling on his belly , and catches up to CUTLER . COLONEL DAWN What 's it look like , Lieutenant ? LIEUTENANT CUTLER Chico 's holed up in there pretty good , sir . COLONEL DAWN You use your 135s on ' im ? LIEUTENANT CUTLER Colonel Dawn , we 've hit ' im with 290s , 628s , 135s , you name it . COLONEL DAWN What seems to be the problem ? LIEUTENANT CUTLER Chico 's got good ordnance , sir . Damn good ordnance and high morale factor . COLONEL DAWN I want to see this area secured , Lieutenant Cutler . LIEUTENANT CUTLER Sir , we 've hit ' im with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fragmentation , seminukes . But hardware do n't impress Chico . These are fanatics , sir . Lives do n't count . p. 3 COLONEL DAWN General Pratt 's scheduled an appearance in this area . I need a good show for General Pratt . LIEUTENANT CUTLER My boys are damn good boys , Colonel Dawn , but Chico is hardnosed . COLONEL DAWN There 's no question we 'll have to pull back . LIEUTENANT CUTLER I do n't anticipate that , sir . But Chico is hardnosed . COLONEL DAWN General Pratt returns to Washington tomorrow . I do n't have to stress the importance his report to the President will have on our effort down here . Our effort down here in Brazil is not a popular effort . LIEUTENANT CUTLER No , sir . If we could only use our CB97s . COLONEL DAWN I was not informed CB97s were deployed . LIEUTENANT CUTLER Yes , sir . Deployed but inoperative . COLONEL DAWN I do n't have that information . LIEUTENANT CUTLER Yes , sir . If we could make our CB97s operative  --  COLONEL DAWN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CUTLER Excuse me , sir , but with Chico holed up where he is , my educated guess would rate the reliability factor upwards of eighty percent . p. 4 COLONEL DAWN It 's in violation of the Geneva Convention  --  LIEUTENANT CUTLER I 'm not a politician , sir . But if we want Chico for General Pratt , CB97 is all I know will do the job . COLONEL DAWN You say it 's deployed ? LIEUTENANT CUTLER Yes , sir . COLONEL DAWN It must have been deployed for a reason . ( Uneasy pause . ) It ca n't be activated without a KCR . LIEUTENANT CUTLER You have KCR authorization . COLONEL DAWN But if I issued a KCR , it would be based on your recommendation . LIEUTENANT CUTLER Mine is an unofficial recommendation , sir . I do n't have authority . COLONEL DAWN I need an official recommendation before I 'm authorized to authorize . Now , should I or should n't I ? Burst of machine-gun fire . Both crawl backward . GENERAL PRATT strides in , stares down at them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in front of a bunch of goddamned Brazilians ? LIEUTENANT CUTLER ( leaps to his feet and salutes ) Tain-hut ! A bullet cuts him down . PRATT drops . DAWN rolls CUTLER over . p. 5 COLONEL DAWN He 's bleeding badly , General Pratt . GENERAL PRATT What 's he mumbling ? LIEUTENANT CUTLER C  --  B  --  9  --  7  --  GENERAL PRATT C  --  B  --  what ? COLONEL DAWN Lieutenant Cutler recommends KCR authorization to activate our CB97s . GENERAL PRATT Does that recommendation meet with your approval , Colonel ? COLONEL DAWN I do n't have the total picture that you do , General Pratt . LIEUTENANT CUTLER C  --  B  --  9  --  7  --  GENERAL PRATT It 's going to be all right , son . ( To DAWN . ) I 'm afraid he 's going to have to lose that leg . This may be his last request , Colonel . COLONEL DAWN Then you say go ahead ? GENERAL PRATT If you say so . COLONEL DAWN I say so if you say so . GENERAL PRATT He said so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if he says so and you say so , I 'll go along . p. 6 COLONEL DAWN Am I to interpret that as a go-ahead on KCR authorization , sir ? GENERAL PRATT If you say so . LIEUTENANT CUTLER C  --  B  --  9  --  7 ! GENERAL PRATT Easy , lad . You 'll get all the CB97s you want ! LIEUTENANT CUTLER God bless you , sir ! DAWN exits running . GENERAL PRATT Wait a minute , Colonel Dawn ! ( Starts after him . ) Colonel Dawn , come back !

PROFESSOR SWEENEY This streak of anarchism in you , Evelyn  --  it sometimes so infuriates me I want to shake you . MRS . HALE Drop a bomb on me instead . Is n't that the traditional relief for frustration around here ? PROFESSOR SWEENEY How can I make you believe the number of bombs I keep from being dropped each day ? MRS . HALE Of what possible threat is Brazil to the United States ? PROFESSOR SWEENEY That 's a policy question . I 'm in research and development . MRS . HALE Is that why we 're in Brazil ? New wars in order to test your new research ? PROFESSOR SWEENEY I 'm as much committed to peace as you are !

( To STILES . ) You hear about her with the sit-ins at the Justice Department last week ? PROFESSOR SWEENEY ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yeah ? ATTORNEY GENERAL COLE Right outside my office . Told ' em their cause was right and they should keep on fighting . Had to threaten the entire press corps with conspiracy indictments to kill the story .

ATTORNEY GENERAL COLE I 'd like to prosecute you for your lousy mail service . POSTMASTER GENERAL STILES The Postmaster General 's job is to deliver the vote . The mail 's incidental . Which is what worries me about Sweeney 's mess in Brazil  --  PROFESSOR SWEENEY ( outraged ) My mess ? POSTMASTER GENERAL STILES Six weeks before the presidential election is not the time to test out poison gas . PROFESSOR SWEENEY That 's top secret information ! POSTMASTER GENERAL STILES I 'm national chairman of the party , Professor . You ca n't keep your little experiments from me . Next time you gas American troops , do it after the first Tuesday in November . PROFESSOR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ POSTMASTER GENERAL STILES The gooks know about the gas , the Postmaster General is n't supposed to . That 's America for you . ATTORNEY GENERAL COLE Chico 's , Tim .

POSTMASTER GENERAL STILES Sweeney 's hanging around the First Lady too much . ATTORNEY GENERAL COLE I wish the President would muzzle that woman . POSTMASTER GENERAL STILES We 're lucky she does n't talk him into muzzling us . ( He laughs . ) ATTORNEY GENERAL COLE ( angry ) It 's not a joke ! It dumfounds me how he can face up to the Russians and the Chinese and the Arabs and the Africans and the Brazilians  --  but wo n't face up to his own wife .

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE PARSON Seven hundred and fifty troops . All ours . POSTMASTER GENERAL STILES Whew ! PROFESSOR SWEENEY This is premature . CB97 does not always result in death . POSTMASTER GENERAL STILES What does it result in , if not death ? PROFESSOR SWEENEY We do n't know . Much depends on climatic conditions . SECRETARY OF DEFENSE PARSON It paralyzed another ninety . Including the Army Chief of Staff . POSTMASTER GENERAL STILES General Pratt ! That 's news to me . ATTORNEY GENERAL COLE Your intelligence is n't up to mine , Tim . I knew it by 9:30 last night .

ATTORNEY GENERAL COLE He made a damned fool of himself over the Brazilian intervention . POSTMASTER GENERAL STILES If he had any horse sense  --  PROFESSOR SWEENEY But he opposed the intervention . So did you , Stiles  --  and you too , Cole . SECRETARY OF DEFENSE PARSON Not after the President made his decision . PROFESSOR SWEENEY He 's the oldest member of the cabinet . Maybe four wars in six years finally got to him . POSTMASTER GENERAL STILES If you ca n't stand the heat , stay out of the kitchen . SECRETARY OF DEFENSE PARSON Who said that ? Harry Truman ? POSTMASTER GENERAL STILES It was n't Chairman Mao . SECRETARY OF DEFENSE PARSON The questions is  --  ( Stops himself . ) ATTORNEY GENERAL COLE What , Biff ? SECRETARY OF DEFENSE PARSON Forget it . PROFESSOR SWEENEY Can the President stand the heat ? Is n't that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DEFENSE PARSON You 're perceptive , Sweeney . I 'll say that for you . ATTORNEY GENERAL COLE You think the President has doubts about our Brazilian commitment ? I ca n't go along with you on that , Biff . SECRETARY OF DEFENSE PARSON He 's never been happy with it . ATTORNEY GENERAL COLE Who is ? POSTMASTER GENERAL STILES Not me . PROFESSOR SWEENEY Two years , and what do we have to show for it ? Twenty-five thousand dead . SECRETARY OF DEFENSE PARSON Those losses are acceptable . A drop in the bucket compared to the African war . We 're learning every day . POSTMASTER GENERAL STILES It could be a damned expensive education with elections six weeks away . ATTORNEY GENERAL COLE And peace conspirators everywhere . I indict a thousand today , a thousand more riot tomorrow . POSTMASTER GENERAL STILES Peace riots are water off a duck 's back to a man in politics as long as the President . SECRETARY OF DEFENSE PARSON I 'm not worried about the riots getting to him . It 's that woman getting to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's worth four divisions of enemy troops . p. 15 ATTORNEY GENERAL COLE I threatened her once with indictment . She laughed . POSTMASTER GENERAL STILES You guys take her too seriously . The country 's amused by her . PROFESSOR SWEENEY She 's a serious woman ! ATTORNEY GENERAL COLE She has no right to laugh at me . SECRETARY OF DEFENSE PARSON She does n't think logically . ATTORNEY GENERAL COLE She must be stopped . SECRETARY OF DEFENSE PARSON That woman  --  ATTORNEY GENERAL COLE That woman  --  PRESIDENT HALE ( enters from stage right ) Good morning , gentlemen . All rise.I 'm sorry I 'm delayed . ( Smiles . ) Mrs. Hale wanted to have several words with me . Please be seated . Secretary Parson , you are well this morning ? SECRETARY OF DEFENSE PARSON Well as can be expected , Mr. President .

I took a few practice strokes with your driver . I could n't resist . ATTORNEY GENERAL COLE My driver is your driver , Mr. President . PRESIDENT HALE You do n't play golf do you , Professor Sweeney ? PROFESSOR SWEENEY No , Mr. President . PRESIDENT HALE You might take it up . It 's a restful game . I wo n't ask you how you are this morning , Tim . You are always the same . POSTMASTER GENERAL STILES Terrible . PRESIDENT HALE I sympathize . My spies tell me you toured the mail room earlier this morning . No man should be forced to see such sights before breakfast . I sometimes wish we were able to slow all forms of communication as successfully as we slow the U.S. mails . POSTMASTER GENERAL STILES I think you enjoy my misery , Mr. President . PRESIDENT HALE Not at all . The Secretary of State will not be joining us this morning . He had some  --  um  --  paper work .

With a pointer ) This is Brazil . Lights fade on President 's office . p. 18 Act 1 , Scene 3 Act One : Scene Three Lights up on battlefield . An eerie green light .

LIEUTENANT CUTLER I must have passed out . The CB97  --  it blew back on us . CAPTAIN WEEMS I do n't know what that is . LIEUTENANT CUTLER Who are you ? CAPTAIN WEEMS Captain Weems , medical corps . LIEUTENANT CUTLER You saved my life . CAPTAIN WEEMS We 're not out of it yet . LIEUTENANT CUTLER Do n't tell me  --  I owe you my life . CAPTAIN WEEMS We 'd better get moving before the gas gets us . LIEUTENANT CUTLER This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is , but it 's not fog and it 's all green . What can it be but gas ? LIEUTENANT CUTLER Why are n't we choking ? p. 19 CAPTAIN WEEMS Could it be a different kind of gas ? LIEUTENANT CUTLER I do n't know anything about it . I always tried to do what I thought was right . I was trying to protect my men . That 's primary ! Maybe you 'd better leave me . CAPTAIN WEEMS We 'd better get back . LIEUTENANT CUTLER All I had in mind was the welfare of my men . You 're a doctor ? CAPTAIN WEEMS Yes . LIEUTENANT CUTLER You have to think of the welfare of your patients . That 's primary , right ? Is that or is n't that primary ? CAPTAIN WEEMS I do n't want to hang around here a minute longer than we have to . LIEUTENANT CUTLER How old are you , Captain Weems ? CAPTAIN WEEMS Twenty-seven . LIEUTENANT CUTLER I 'm twenty-eight . Where are you from ? CAPTAIN WEEMS Cleveland . LIEUTENANT CUTLER I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  LIEUTENANT CUTLER You 're a doctor , right ? Tell me : why does n't it ever turn out right ? p. 20 CAPTAIN WEEMS Best to get it off your chest . LIEUTENANT CUTLER What are you writing down ? CAPTAIN WEEMS Notes . LIEUTENANT CUTLER What 's your favorite number ? CAPTAIN WEEMS Twenty-seven . LIEUTENANT CUTLER Mine 's twenty-eight . What 's your favorite color ? CAPTAIN WEEMS White . LIEUTENANT CUTLER Mine 's white too . You married ? CAPTAIN WEEMS We 'd better get moving . LIEUTENANT CUTLER You married ? CAPTAIN WEEMS Yes . LIEUTENANT CUTLER Any kids ? CAPTAIN WEEMS Two kids . A boy and a girl . LIEUTENANT CUTLER How old ? CAPTAIN WEEMS The boy 's five , the girl 's three . LIEUTENANT CUTLER Five and three . That makes eight . You 're twenty-seven . Twenty-seven and eight make thirty-five . That 's okay . Oh , yeah  --  how old is your wife ? CAPTAIN WEEMS Twenty-one . LIEUTENANT CUTLER That spoils it . It 's not advisable to talk to many people . We 'd better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . LIEUTENANT CUTLER We 'd better get moving . My leg feels much better . CAPTAIN WEEMS What leg ? LIEUTENANT CUTLER My wounded leg . CAPTAIN WEEMS You mean the leg lying over there ? LIEUTENANT CUTLER My leg . ( Feels for it . ) I 've lost my leg . CAPTAIN WEEMS You were groaning . I was trying to find you . I stepped on it . It broke right off . LIEUTENANT CUTLER Serves me right . I do n't feel any pain . Do you mind helping me onto my feet  --  foot , Captain ? WEEMS helps him up . They stagger a few steps.Are you sure you 're a doctor ? CAPTAIN WEEMS I bandaged your head , did n't I ? Lights fade on battlefield. p. 22 Act 1 , Scene 4 Act One : Scene Four Lights up on President 's office . SECRETARY OF DEFENSE PARSON ( at chart ) This is the Mato Grosso where current fighting is in progress . The fighting is centered at five points . ( Indicates . ) In the north , northeast , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact , everywhere . SECRETARY OF DEFENSE PARSON These are tough little guys we 're fighting , Mr. President . PRESIDENT HALE Are we losing the Mato Grosso , Mr. Parson ? SECRETARY OF DEFENSE PARSON We 're taking heavier losses than projected but , no , sir , we are not losing . The Mato Grosso will be secured , no question . But there are setbacks , and Operation Total Win was one of them . ( Points to new chart . ) The aim of Operation Total Win was to defuse the threat of an enemy buildup in response to our last offensive . This called for air and artillery strikes followed by massive assaults along the entire south-east-west frontier . From points A to K. PRESIDENT HALE Under whose command was Operation Total Win ? SECRETARY OF DEFENSE PARSON The late Colonel Frank R. Dawn of the 299th . On the seventeenth of September  --  p. 23 PRESIDENT HALE Two days ago . SECRETARY OF DEFENSE PARSON Yes , sir . At 1600 hours , the combat zone was toured by Army Chief of Staff General Maurice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ counterattack necessitated a withdrawal along ( indicates on new map ) points A , B , C , D , E , F , and G to straighten out our lines . An immediate counterattack at 2100 hours was mounted by the 295th , 297th , and 299th , and we regained our positions here , point A , here , point C , here , point E , and here , G but became stalled here , point B , here , point D , and here , point F , where we underwent heavy artillery bombardment from enemy 9s and 10s mounted ( new map ) at here P , here Q , here R , and here S. All subsequent efforts , including twelve air strikes , failed to dislodge the enemy . At 2330 hours a CB97 Nerve Agent was released on enemy positions P , Q , R , and S. The CB97s were artillery-launched from positions A-1 , C-1 , E-1 , and here , G-1 . The anticipated results of the Nerve Agent were counterachieved by a sudden shift in wind , as indicated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CB97s are reported to have contaminated the following areas : A-1 , C-1 , E-1 , and , with high probability , G-1 . We are at a temporary contact lapse with G-1 , and the situation there is still to be confirmed . That summarizes the situation to date . p. 24 PRESIDENT HALE The CB97 , in effect , was fired on our own troops . SECRETARY OF DEFENSE PARSON It was fired against the enemy , sir , and would have worked  --  but for the meteorological variants . PRESIDENT HALE How many fatalities ? SECRETARY OF DEFENSE PARSON From the CB97 ? PRESIDENT HALE ( impatient ) Yes . Yes . SECRETARY OF DEFENSE PARSON Seven hundred and fifty . PRESIDENT HALE How many paralyzed ? SECRETARY OF DEFENSE PARSON The count is now up to ninety . There may be more . The area is still not decontaminated . PROFESSOR SWEENEY I would be cautious about those figures , Mr. President . CB97 has certain progressive side effects , the full value of which have yet to be verified . PRESIDENT HALE What is the condition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loss of sight which may or may not be permanent , paralysis of the left side of his body which may or may not be permanent , and permanent damage to the larynx . PRESIDENT HALE Is he present for this meeting ? p. 25 SECRETARY OF DEFENSE PARSON He is . PRESIDENT HALE Will we be able to communicate with him ? SECRETARY OF DEFENSE PARSON Yes , sir . His voice is miked . PRESIDENT HALE Ask him in here , please . PARSON exits stage right , re-enters escorting GENERAL PRATT . PRATT , in uniform , walks stiffly , wears dark glasses , carries a cane . His face is broken out with sores.How are you , General Pratt ? GENERAL PRATT ( speaks gutturally through throat mike ) Never better , sir . PRESIDENT HALE You get around very well . GENERAL PRATT I 'm an old night fighter , Mr. President . PRESIDENT HALE Allow me to express the hope of all of us in the executive branch for your rapid recovery and return to duty . GENERAL PRATT I 'm an old war horse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light can you bring  --  uh  --  what can you tell us about this ghastly affair ? GENERAL PRATT Colonel Dawn , the mission command officer for Operation Total Win received in my presence a recommendation from his intelligence officer , Lieutenant Cutler , to initiate the dispersal of the toxic chemical agent CB97 . Colonel Dawn concurred in this recommendation and immediately instituted KCR authorization . PRESIDENT : I was under the assumption that no one under the rank of general had KCR authorization. p. 26 GENERAL PRATT That is correct , sir . Colonel Dawn had . RCK authorization which , in the heat of battle , he understandably confused with KCR authorization . RCK , KCR . PRESIDENT HALE ( sighs ) You have KCR authorization , do you not , General Pratt ? GENERAL PRATT Yes , sir . When I became apprised of the significance of CB97 dispersal , I sought to countermand Colonel Dawn 's order . However , I was too late and Colonel Dawn and his staff had fallen by the time I reached Command Head-quarters . PRESIDENT HALE Why was the gas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Command Headquarters seven to ten minutes after dispersal . PROFESSOR SWEENEY General Pratt ? GENERAL PRATT Sir ? PROFESSOR SWEENEY On the basis of evidence in the field , can you draw any conclusions about the span of CB97 effectiveness ? GENERAL PRATT My own conclusion is that there is a declining scale of effectiveness after six minutes . For example , the gas operated at close to peak effectiveness on Colonel Dawn and his troops . But it was no more than fifty percent effective in terms of myself . I was blinded , paralyzed on my left side , suffered second degree facial burns , and received damage to my voice . p. 27 PROFESSOR SWEENEY I would rate that higher than fifty percent , General Pratt , in that the side effects you describe are every bit as helpful to us in terms of pacification  --  GENERAL PRATT I would agree completely . PROFESSOR SWEENEY I ca n't tell you how valuable your information is to us . One more question . Is it your opinion that if not for the sudden shift in wind , CB97 would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the integration of electronic wind control supports , I would not write off CB97 as an effective weapon in our peace arsenal . SECRETARY OF DEFENSE PARSON Then you do not fault Colonel Dawn for ordering CB97 dispersal ? GENERAL PRATT Other than the procedural oversight on authorization , it is my opinion Colonel Dawn made a correct decision at the time he made it . Five minutes later that decision was inappropriate . SECRETARY OF DEFENSE PARSON Then you are completely satisfied . GENERAL PRATT Yes , sir . According to aerial photographs and intelligence estimates , enemy losses are twenty-five times higher than our own . PROFESSOR SWEENEY I would very much like to see those estimates . p. 28 GENERAL PRATT They are classified cosmic . SECRETARY OF DEFENSE PARSON I 'll arrange to have them released to you . PROFESSOR SWEENEY Thank you . SECRETARY OF DEFENSE PARSON It 'll take a few days . GENERAL PRATT Ten days . PROFESSOR SWEENEY This ca n't wait ten days . GENERAL PRATT I 'm sorry , Professor Sweeney . Release from cosmic takes ten days . PRESIDENT HALE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ endless fascination , but I am not a scientist . I am the President of the United States six weeks before an election . Can anyone suggest what I say to the American people about the death of seven hundred and fifty American soldiers by an American-made gas ? SECRETARY OF DEFENSE PARSON I think you 'll find if you prorate these casualties , Mr. President  --  GENERAL PRATT These are feasible casualties  --  PRESIDENT HALE These are illegal casualties . Mr. Attorney General ? ATTORNEY GENERAL COLE Yes . The fact of the matter is that all chemical and biological weapons were outlawed by the last Geneva Convent  --  p. 29 PROFESSOR SWEENEY ( interrupts ) We did n't sign it  --  we did n't sign it ! ATTORNEY GENERAL COLE Nevertheless , we signaled general approve  --  PROFESSOR SWEENEY I 'm very sorry  --  we did n't sign it . PRESIDENT HALE Is it your view , Professor Sweeney , that these deaths are perfectly legal ? PROFESSOR SWEENEY Good heavens , of course they 're legal . It 's research and development . Why must we always tie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violate the letter of the law , but it violates the spirit of the law . PRESIDENT HALE We must n't appear casual about the law . SECRETARY OF DEFENSE PARSON International law ? Are n't we being a little legalistic ? POSTMASTER GENERAL STILES We do n't want to be charged with respect for law at home and contempt for it abroad . ATTORNEY GENERAL COLE No , not in these times . POSTMASTER GENERAL STILES It could put us in a bad light . PROFESSOR SWEENEY Only because the public is unaware of the tremendous peace-keeping potential  --  p. 30 POSTMASTER GENERAL STILES Of nerve gas ? ! GENERAL PRATT The American people will stand behind their command officers . PRESIDENT HALE I could n't agree more , General Pratt . Once they are informed on the issues . ATTORNEY GENERAL COLE And they have n't been informed . SECRETARY OF DEFENSE PARSON This is too complex an issue for public debate . PRESIDENT HALE I 'm inclined to agree with Secretary Parson . Well , there 's certain to be a leak . We will have to leak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be difficult since the public is under the impression we have discontinued production of poison gas . SECRETARY OF DEFENSE PARSON We have discontinued production , sir . PROFESSOR SWEENEY But not research . PRESIDENT HALE Research has continued ? PROFESSOR SWEENEY Research always continues . PRESIDENT HALE Then the deployment of the gas to Brazil was all in the line of research ? PROFESSOR SWEENEY That is correct . PRESIDENT HALE Who ordered the deployment ? No response . p. 31 PROFESSOR SWEENEY I did n't , sir . PRESIDENT HALE Secretary Parson ? SECRETARY OF DEFENSE PARSON An investigation within the department of defense is underway on that , sir . PRESIDENT HALE You do n't know who sent the gas to Brazil ? SECRETARY OF DEFENSE PARSON I know I did n't . GENERAL PRATT I did n't either . PRESIDENT HALE We must know the facts . We must be able to protect ourselves . General Pratt , do you have any idea who ordered this deployment ? ( Long pause . ) Any idea at all ? GENERAL PRATT I do not . PRESIDENT HALE ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ourselves ? ( Long pause as PRESIDENT turns to each of his advisors . ) SECRETARY OF DEFENSE PARSON In matters involving the national security  --  ATTORNEY GENERAL COLE We have the right to withhold certain information  --  PROFESSOR SWEENEY CB97 is a comparatively humane  --  POSTMASTER GENERAL STILES We could say they used the gas on us. p. 32 ATTORNEY GENERAL COLE The Brazilians ? We could n't make it stick . POSTMASTER GENERAL STILES Why not ? The Russians supplied them . COLE shakes his head.The Chinese ? PRESIDENT HALE One foreign crisis at a time , Tim , please . POSTMASTER GENERAL STILES The Russians will understand . They know American politics . ATTORNEY GENERAL COLE I do n't see any way out of conceding deployment . SECRETARY OF DEFENSE PARSON If we concede deployment , there goes your ball game . ATTORNEY GENERAL COLE Not if intelligence reports led us to suspect the Brazilians were in the process of being supplied with nerve gas . POSTMASTER GENERAL STILES Is n't that what I said ? ATTORNEY GENERAL COLE I 'm not finished . We could not risk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so strictly as a deterrent  --  to keep them from using their gas on us  --  deployment of CB97 was ordered . GENERAL PRATT This could very well be the case . SECRETARY OF DEFENSE PARSON I like that . Intelligence reports  --  p. 33 ATTORNEY GENERAL COLE And captured enemy documents . POSTMASTER GENERAL STILES But then what ? Do they use it and we responded , or what ? GENERAL PRATT Colonel Dawn ordered it . POSTMASTER GENERAL STILES He 's dead , is n't he ? We ca n't blame it on anybody dead . ATTORNEY GENERAL COLE I lean toward a mishap  --  an accident . SECRETARY OF DEFENSE PARSON Every time we report an accident the military is made to look like fools . ATTORNEY GENERAL COLE This wo n't be blamed on you . A gas leak . PROFESSOR SWEENEY Our gas does n't leak ! ATTORNEY GENERAL COLE Well , it 's got to be something like a gas leak . POSTMASTER GENERAL STILES An act of God . SECRETARY OF DEFENSE PARSON Maybe it was hit by lightning . GENERAL PRATT The rainy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maybe one of the storage tanks gets hit by an enemy shell . GENERAL PRATT That could happen . PROFESSOR SWEENEY What are CB97 storage tanks doing within the range of enemy shells ? p. 34 SECRETARY OF DEFENSE PARSON All right , say a stray enemy shell . GENERAL PRATT A guerrilla patrol could have gotten behind our lines . That does happen . ATTORNEY GENERAL COLE That 's very good , General Pratt . SECRETARY OF DEFENSE PARSON Excellent , General Pratt . A suicide patrol . We do n't know if they knew what those storage tanks contained and deliberately shelled them or  --  ATTORNEY GENERAL COLE It could have been an accident or deliberate . SECRETARY OF DEFENSE PARSON We 'll never know . No one will ever know . POSTMASTER GENERAL STILES That 's it ! By golly , that does it ! PROFESSOR SWEENEY It does seem the simplest way .

Whatever becomes of us , Captain , it 's classified information . I hope you 're aware of that . CAPTAIN WEEMS But we can talk about it just between the two of us . LIEUTENANT CUTLER Anyone around ? CAPTAIN WEEMS I ca n't turn my head . LIEUTENANT CUTLER I ca n't either . But where my leg is missing  --  it feels great . CAPTAIN WEEMS I never felt better . Let 's rest .

There 's only one way I know of to relieve great stress . Get it off your chest . LIEUTENANT CUTLER How do I know you are who you say you are ? CAPTAIN WEEMS What 's on your mind , Lieutenant ? LIEUTENANT CUTLER You could be trying to entrap me ! CAPTAIN WEEMS Why should I want to do that ? LIEUTENANT CUTLER Someone has to take the blame for the gas ! You could be CIA ! WEEMS chuckles.Sent out to bring me back for court-martial ! ( Takes out his 45 . ) I 'm not going back with you ! p. 37 CAPTAIN WEEMS I 'm not going to leave you here .

POSTMASTER GENERAL STILES Who can we give the story to ? SECRETARY OF DEFENSE PARSON Most of the press corps in Washington will play ball . POSTMASTER GENERAL STILES This story ca n't come out of Washington . ATTORNEY GENERAL COLE Right . It would be best to come from on the spot . I would think if we could take the accent off the gas and place it on the extremely hazardous nature of these enemy suicide patrols  --  SECRETARY OF DEFENSE PARSON Yes . And to illustrate  --  there was this recent incident with the gas  --  We 've worked a lot with these guys in the past ; I have no doubt most will be willing to see it our way . PRESIDENT HALE Make up a press list , Secretary Parson , and let me review it . SECRETARY OF DEFENSE PARSON Yes , sir . PRESIDENT HALE Say in fifteen minutes ? SECRETARY OF DEFENSE PARSON @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ follow this up by a story out of Washington . A backgrounder with someone we can trust . p. 40 POSTMASTER GENERAL STILES Do you want a list ? PRESIDENT HALE ( tired ) Yes . Everybody go inside and make up a list . PARSON , COLE , and STILES rise.In the meantime you , Professor Sweeney , can write down a simplified history of the CB97 : when it was developed , what it is , its humane properties , et cetera . SWEENEY nods.In fifteen minutes . PRESIDENT Sighs . SWEENEY rises.General Pratt  --  um  --  General Pratt , it seems to me there is still a trace of confusion in your story . I 'd like you to go over it again in your mind . See what you can come up with . All right ? GENERAL PRATT Yes , sir . PRESIDENT HALE ( indicates stage left ) You can use that office . Mr. Stiles will show you . STILES helps him , and returns.Well , what do we do with him ? POSTMASTER GENERAL STILES We ca n't let the press at him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hospital . PROFESSOR SWEENEY He can resign for reasons of ill health . POSTMASTER GENERAL STILES He ca n't resign . p. 41 SECRETARY OF DEFENSE PARSON It 'll look bad . ATTORNEY GENERAL COLE He has to be promoted . SECRETARY OF DEFENSE PARSON To clear the air . ATTORNEY GENERAL COLE Maybe a White House ceremony in his honor . POSTMASTER GENERAL STILES Good ! We give him a new medal . SECRETARY OF DEFENSE PARSON He has every medal . POSTMASTER GENERAL STILES We give him a presidential citation . ATTORNEY GENERAL COLE And a new job . SECRETARY OF DEFENSE PARSON You ca n't just kick him upstairs . POSTMASTER GENERAL STILES Where do we put him ? SECRETARY OF DEFENSE PARSON West Point ? ATTORNEY GENERAL COLE We do n't want him too far away . SECRETARY OF DEFENSE PARSON Draft director ?

Perhaps General Pratt should have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rises . Others rise.Gentlemen , I do not want to keep you from your lists . They exit stage right . PRESIDENT sits heavily . After a moment , a low murmur.Dear God . ( Switches on intercom . ) You can come in now , Evelyn . He sits back and waits . MRS . HALE enters through door behind President 's desk . She stands and waits.Evelyn , I 'm going to tell you the truth about what 's happened , but I want your promise of utmost secrecy . I do n't want this leaked to any of your pet peace groups . Do I have your promise ? p. 42 MRS . HALE You can leak , but I ca n't . PRESIDENT HALE I happen to be President . MRS . HALE Then do n't confide in me . PRESIDENT HALE If I did n't confide in you , you 'd be impossible to live with . Besides , you make an accurate barometer for a certain kind of public opinion . MRS . HALE What kind ? PRESIDENT HALE The nineteenth-century kind . Those who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are you so bitter toward me ? Is it because you know you 're wrong and I 'm right ? PRESIDENT HALE At , least that 's an explanation you can accept . I wish you had a little more understanding for the burdens of my office . MRS . HALE I ca n't listen to any more about the " Agony of Power . " I still remember how much more agony you were in when you were out of power . PRESIDENT HALE You always mock me . MRS . HALE You never listen to me ! PRESIDENT HALE Most of Washington thinks I listen too much to you . MRS . HALE Washington ! PRESIDENT HALE Why do you hate Washington ? Because I 'm its first citizen ? p. 43 MRS . HALE I hate it because it 's unreal . Stop feeling sorry for yourself . PRESIDENT HALE Am I unreal ? MRS . HALE You do n't exist . Nobody here exists . That 's what scares me most about Washington . All these absent people making war . PRESIDENT HALE You 're angry because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . HALE You treat me as a joke . PRESIDENT HALE I treat you  --  I treat you at arm 's length . It 's the closest I can come to you these days . MRS . HALE How can I shut up when I know you 're wrong ? PRESIDENT HALE ( sarcastic ) That 's more than I have a right to expect . But I do expect you to play by the rules of the game ! It 's in here that we thrash out our differences . Out there we present a united front . MRS . HALE What happened in Brazil ? PRESIDENT HALE You 'll play by the rules ? No response.Is that agreed ? MRS . HALE First tell me what happened in Brazil . PRESIDENT HALE ( suddenly businesslike ) Recent intelligence reports and captured enemy documents revealed to us that the Chinese were supplying or were about to supply the Brazilians with a quantity of deadly nerve gas . As a deterrent action , we warned the Brazilians that we were deploying the chemical Nerve Agent CB97 to our forces in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gas attack on the part of the enemy . The enemy knew this . They were warned . In a night patrol action of two nights ago enemy forces infiltrated the area where our CB97 was stockpiled . An enemy shell hit one of the storage tanks . The nerve gas was released . Seven hundred and fifty of our men were killed . Ninety were paralyzed . You and I both know in how many ways this story can be distorted , made to look very different from what it is  --  and the meeting , this morning 's meeting , was to decide whether , six weeks before an election , we dared release such news . p. 44 MRS . HALE And what did you decide ? PRESIDENT HALE By unanimous decision , it was agreed that the American people must be told the truth . MRS . HALE As you have told it to me . PRESIDENT HALE Yes . Channeled through reliable sources . There must be no leaks . Well ? MRS . HALE Well what ? PRESIDENT HALE What do you think ? MRS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HALE Christ ! Evelyn  --  behave . MRS . HALE You 've become as dishonest with me as you are with the rest of the country . I do n't have to swallow these lies ! I am your wife , not your constituent ! I want a divorce ! PRESIDENT HALE Do n't make me lose respect for you . MRS . HALE The arrogance ! You 're not going to get away with this ! Even the pollsters know we 're not winning this war ! Why should the Brazilians , in a war they 're winning , import , into their own country , poison gas ! PRESIDENT HALE No one said they were importing it . You 're too self-righteous to listen to anybody who is n't carrying a picket sign . What I said was unconfirmed intelligence reports  --  p. 45 MRS . HALE And captured enemy documents ! PRESIDENT HALE What 's wrong with captured enemy documents ? MRS . HALE They only get captured after we 've written them ! You 'll never be able to explain why we put the gas there unless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with ! Is that what really happened ? Your experiment backfired ? PRESIDENT HALE It was n't my experiment ! MRS . HALE Sweeney 's experiment ! PRESIDENT HALE Other husbands get support from their wives . Why ca n't I ? MRS . HALE I 've never stopped supporting your ideals . PRESIDENT HALE My ideals have n't changed . MRS . HALE Then why these lies ? PRESIDENT HALE We 're at war ! MRS . HALE I 'm not talking about lies to Brazilians  --  I 'm talking about lies to Americans ! This is the government of the United States you 're running , not an advertising agency ! PRESIDENT HALE You do n't have the vaguest understanding of the processes of change ! You make us sound like a gang of conspirators ! MRS . HALE Well , are n't you ? You talk only to each other , accept intelligence only from hired hands , debate the issues only with the insiders , call their guesses a consensus and bury their mistakes because no one but you and your henchmen have the " vaguest understanding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wo n't be a party to it . I wo n't be your coconspirator ! p. 46 PRESIDENT HALE You agreed to play by the rules . MRS . HALE One more lie ! PRESIDENT HALE Not five minutes ago you agreed . MRS . HALE You are unbelievable ! You believe anything you want to believe ! PRESIDENT HALE ( rises , very cold ) Evelyn , I have work to do . MRS . HALE ( reaches for phone ) And so do I ! PRESIDENT HALE Get off that phone . No response.Get off that phone ! No response.That is my phone ! MRS . HALE Get me The New York Times .

You take over ten , up to eighteen , nineteen  --  you 're looking real good . Anything you take over twenty and upwards says you 're all balls . Twenty and upwards . All balls .

Losing my leg is seven . CAPTAIN WEEMS I 'm sorry . LIEUTENANT CUTLER What ? CAPTAIN WEEMS Three fingers broke off . LIEUTENANT CUTLER You did your best . Losing my fingers is eight . CAPTAIN WEEMS It does n't hurt ? LIEUTENANT CUTLER Other things hurt . Not my fingers . CAPTAIN WEEMS Where does it hurt ? LIEUTENANT CUTLER It hurts knowing I 'm not going to go out all balls .

Well  --  I doubt if there 's an accusation you did n't make behind her back that I did n't make to her face . Well , we all underrated her . She was the best part of me . My moral center .

Gentlemen , an assassin has achieved access to the inner chamber of the President of the United States . If he has struck once , nothing prevents him from striking again . And again . None of us is safe until he has been apprehended . In order to avert national hysteria , we will delay an announcement of Mrs. Hale 's death until this crime is solved and an explanation decided upon for the American people . But there are bound to be leaks . That gives us only a few hours . Mr. Attorney General p. 53 ATTORNEY GENERAL COLE Yes , Mr. President . PRESIDENT HALE Please bring in the murder weapon .

PRESIDENT HALE What can you tell us about this sign , Mr. Cole ? ATTORNEY GENERAL COLE I 've had a fingerprint check made , Mr. President . We have found two very clear sets of prints .

CAPTAIN WEEMS Because I ca n't blink . Can you ? LIEUTENANT CUTLER I try not to blink . You miss things . Besides , you know you can blink if you want to , do n't you ? CAPTAIN WEEMS I guess I do . LIEUTENANT CUTLER Even if we do n't know , we still know . Inside we know . CAPTAIN WEEMS I always felt I could do anything if I wanted to . LIEUTENANT CUTLER That 's what makes us strong .

ATTORNEY GENERAL COLE No , sir . PRESIDENT HALE Neither do I. Let 's have a closer look . COLE hands PRESIDENT picket sign.I always assumed these supports were made of wood . This one is steel . PROFESSOR SWEENEY Steel ! PRESIDENT HALE What do you make of this , Secretary Parson ? ( Hands sign to PARSON . ) SECRETARY OF DEFENSE PARSON Ordinary cardboard placard . Steel support . Stapled . Sweeney ? ( Passes it to SWEENEY , who freezes . ) PROFESSOR SWEENEY I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it to STILES . POSTMASTER GENERAL STILES How could anyone smuggle anything this size into the White House ? PRESIDENT HALE Good question . STILES passes sign to PRATT . GENERAL PRATT Thank you . ( Feels rod . ) Ouch . This tip is jagged . As if it 's been broken off . p. 60 ATTORNEY GENERAL COLE ( crosses and takes sign from PRATT ) He 's right . Something else was on here and it 's been broken off . PRESIDENT HALE We have now examined the murder weapon and made some interesting findings . The support is not wood , but steel . The tip is jagged . Something has been broken off indicating that the original form of this instrument differs from its present form . And Mr. Stiles has brought up the interesting question of how so conspicuous an object was carried into the White House . Let 's see if we can do as well with the fingerprints . Mr. Cole ? ATTORNEY GENERAL COLE The fingerprints were found up here . Behind the placard . PROFESSOR SWEENEY Behind the placard ? ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and clearest set are identified as yours , Mr. President . Your right hand is below your left . Both hands grip the support tightly with both thumbs pointing inward and downward , thus . PRESIDENT HALE ( rises and demonstrates grip in air ) Is this correct ? ATTORNEY GENERAL COLE Your left thumb should overlap somewhat into the palm of your right hand . PRESIDENT HALE Like this ? p. 61 ATTORNEY GENERAL COLE That would be right . PRESIDENT HALE ( tries a downward stabbing motion ) An awkward method of impaling someone if you happen to be right-handed . And I am righthanded . Now , tell us about your fingerprints , Mr. Cole . ATTORNEY GENERAL COLE My prints are not as recent as yours . But they clasp or grip the support in an identical manner . PRESIDENT HALE And you are also right-handed . ATTORNEY GENERAL COLE Yes , sir . PRESIDENT HALE You are not ambidextrous ? ATTORNEY GENERAL COLE No , sir . You can check my files . In any case , your prints are the more recent ones . PROFESSOR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is impossible , Professor Sweeney ? PROFESSOR SWEENEY It 's impossible for anyone to grip the support behind the placard with the placard attached . COLE offers him the picket sign . He recoils.No  --  try it yourself . There just is n't enough space . ATTORNEY GENERAL COLE He 's right . PARSON takes picket sign from him and tries to grip it . p. 62 SECRETARY OF DEFENSE PARSON You ca n't get your fingers around . ( Hands sign to STILES . ) POSTMASTER GENERAL STILES ( refuses sign ) I trust you . So what does that prove ? PROFESSOR SWEENEY Both sets of fingerprints had to be on the support before the placard was stapled on . GENERAL PRATT Before the murder . PROFESSOR SWEENEY Exactly ! POSTMASTER GENERAL STILES Fingerprints can be planted . PRESIDENT HALE No , I do n't think these prints were planted . PROFESSOR SWEENEY But how did they get there ? PRESIDENT HALE Take a closer look at the support , wo n't you , Mr. Cole . Does it look familiar ? ATTORNEY GENERAL COLE No , sir . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it as a picket sign . Try to imagine some sort of appendage on the jagged tip . ATTORNEY GENERAL COLE No , I have never seen this before . PRESIDENT HALE Does anyone else see anything ? p. 63 SECRETARY OF DEFENSE PARSON ( slowly ) Yes . PRESIDENT HALE What ? PARSON shakes his head.Professor Sweeney ? PROFESSOR SWEENEY I have many ideas . I 'm sorting them out . PRESIDENT HALE Mr. Stiles ? STILES shakes his head.Mr . Cole , I believe you said this morning that those were your golf clubs in the anteroom . Would you go out there and bring back your driver ? ATTORNEY GENERAL COLE ( does n't move ) Are you suggesting that 's my driver ? ( Takes picket sign in his hands . ) It is my driver . ( Looks at PRESIDENT , stricken . ) Oh , my God ! It 's my driver ! ( Collapses in his chair . ) It 's my driver  --  it 's my driver  --  SECRETARY OF DEFENSE PARSON I had a hunch ! PROFESSOR SWEENEY Of course ! You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few practice swings with  --  with  --  PRESIDENT HALE Mr. Cole 's driver . PROFESSOR SWEENEY Was that it ? I do n't play golf . p. 64 PRESIDENT HALE Do you remember my saying that , Mr. Cole ? ATTORNEY GENERAL COLE Yes , sir . But my driver  --  PRESIDENT HALE Do you remember , Secretary Parson ? SECRETARY OF DEFENSE PARSON I do n't think I do , Mr. President . PRESIDENT HALE Mr. Stiles ? POSTMASTER GENERAL STILES You said it all right . I was sitting right here . PRESIDENT HALE You were not in the room at the time , General Pratt . GENERAL PRATT No , sir . SECRETARY OF DEFENSE PARSON I remember now ! I do remember . PRESIDENT HALE Well , we have come a long way in a short time . We now know that the murder weapon was no ordinary picket sign , but the shaft of a golf club with the head broken off . This explains the fingerprints . Now , what else have we learned ? We have learned that the murderer went to considerable trouble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found on the murder weapon . SECRETARY OF DEFENSE PARSON A frame-up ! PROFESSOR SWEENEY But how could he hope to get away with it ? p. 65 PRESIDENT HALE Obviously he could n't hope to get away with it . He hoped to interfere with  --  possibly even to halt this investigation . For those prints represent two things . They represent a confession . PROFESSOR SWEENEY A confession ? PRESIDENT HALE And they represent a warning . SWEENEY AND PARSON A warning ! PRESIDENT HALE A confession and a warning . The murderer is confessing that he knew my fingerprints were on that golf club and he is warning me that the only way he could know this was to be seated in one of these chairs when I mentioned to Mr. Cole that I had my hands on his driver this morning . ATTORNEY GENERAL COLE Mr. President ? PRESIDENT HALE Mr. Cole ? ATTORNEY GENERAL COLE Should we pursue this course ? Is it wise ? POSTMASTER GENERAL STILES There must be some other explanation . Others in short outbursts of agitated ad lib comments . PRESIDENT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm pursuing this for personal reasons ? Once a Pandora 's box of fear and doubt is left lying open in our midst , we will , every one of us , be sucked helplessly into its maw. p. 66 ATTORNEY GENERAL COLE If I may offer a dissenting view ? PRESIDENT HALE I am most anxious to hear it . ATTORNEY GENERAL COLE First of all , Mr. President , I want to say how remarkably I think you 've conducted this entire business . Others murmur assent . PRESIDENT nods in acceptance of compliment.Mrs . Hale 's death was an error . No doubt about it . Some one of us panicked . But whichever one of us he is , there can be no question that he had only his country 's interests at heart . His motive was misguided , possibly half-mad , but rooted in a love for this country that the First Lady did not share , rooted in a belief in the continuity of this administration , your administration , that the First Lady tried unceasingly to divide . I 'm not defending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know how dear she was to you . But the Pandora 's box of fear and doubt you so eloquently speak of can not be nailed shut by conducting a witch hunt among your advisors . And make no mistake . A witch hunt this investigation must inevitably become : replete with rumor , lie , half-truth , and innuendo . By this route , we will destroy ourselves more successfully than our worst enemies dream . PRESIDENT HALE You suggest we drop this investigation ? p. 67 ATTORNEY GENERAL COLE In the interests of national security , I do , sir . PRESIDENT HALE ( coldly ) We are speaking of my wife , Mr. Cole , not some Brazilian . We will proceed with our investigation . Mr. Cole , Mr. Parson , Mr. Stiles , Professor Sweeney , General Pratt : this morning , before , during , or after our meeting , did any of you see anything or hear anything on the part of anyone else in this room that in the light of later events demands clarification ? A stony response.Mr . Cole , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ATTORNEY GENERAL COLE You seriously want me to answer that question ? PRESIDENT HALE You are free to seek the advice of counsel . ATTORNEY GENERAL COLE ( coldly ) You know where I was . Where we all were . Out in the anteroom putting together a list of trustworthy newsmen to whom we could break the Brazilian suicide night patrol story . PRESIDENT HALE You were all there ? All nod.At no time did any of you leave ? All shake their heads.At no time did any of you see any of the others leave ? All shake their heads.That puts you in sort of a difficult position , does n't it , General Pratt ? You were n't with the others . p. 68 GENERAL PRATT No , sir . PRESIDENT HALE You were alone . GENERAL PRATT I 'm a blind , half-paralyzed man , Mr. President . PRESIDENT HALE An old night fighter , as you described yourself . GENERAL PRATT I was n't in the room when you talked about golf . PRESIDENT HALE That is true . GENERAL PRATT Besides , I was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't ? GENERAL PRATT Someone opened the door . PRESIDENT HALE Who opened the door ? GENERAL PRATT Someone opened it and must have seen the room was occupied . Anyhow , he closed it right away . PRESIDENT HALE Do you know who it was ? GENERAL PRATT He mumbled something like " Sorry . " I did n't quite get it . PRESIDENT HALE Would you recognize the voice if you heard it again ? GENERAL PRATT I have sharp ears . PRESIDENT HALE Mr. Cole , will you say " Sorry " for General Pratt . p. 69 ATTORNEY GENERAL COLE Sorry . GENERAL PRATT It was more of a mumble . ATTORNEY GENERAL COLE ( mumbles ) Sorry . GENERAL PRATT That could be it . ATTORNEY GENERAL COLE I was n't in there ! PRESIDENT HALE All in good time , Mr. Cole . Secretary Parson , will you mumble " Sorry " ? SECRETARY OF DEFENSE PARSON Sorry . GENERAL PRATT I did n't hear it . PRESIDENT HALE A louder mumble if you please , Secretary Parson . SECRETARY OF DEFENSE PARSON Sorry . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sweeney . Your turn . PROFESSOR SWEENEY Sorry . PRESIDENT HALE In your normal voice , Professor Sweeney . PROFESSOR SWEENEY That was my normal voice . PRESIDENT HALE No , it was n't . You used a bit of a falsetto . PROFESSOR SWEENEY I did n't realize , I 'm sorry . p. 70 GENERAL PRATT That 's the one ! That 's it ! PROFESSOR SWEENEY It was n't me ! I did n't go in there ! GENERAL PRATT That was your " Sorry " ! I 'd bet on it . PROFESSOR SWEENEY I never went into that room ! I went into another room ! PRESIDENT HALE You what ? PROFESSOR SWEENEY To use the telephone ! You wanted me to do an on-the-spot description of the CB97 . I had to call the office to get some information ! But I did n't open General Pratt 's door ! And I did n't say " Sorry " ! GENERAL PRATT That 's it ! PRESIDENT HALE But you did make a phone call ! ? PROFESSOR SWEENEY Only for a minute . PRESIDENT HALE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the room to make a telephone call ? SECRETARY OF DEFENSE PARSON I guess I did n't see him leave . I was on the phone . PRESIDENT HALE In the anteroom ? SECRETARY OF DEFENSE PARSON No , Stiles was on the anteroom phone , so I went down the hall and found an empty office . PRESIDENT HALE Mr. Stiles ? p. 71 POSTMASTER GENERAL STILES I swear I thought they were all there . You know me when I get on the phone . PRESIDENT HALE And where were you through all this , Mr. Cole ? Sitting there unnoticed ? Perhaps toying with your golf clubs ? ATTORNEY GENERAL COLE I was on the phone . PRESIDENT HALE Which phone ? ATTORNEY GENERAL COLE I had to go upstairs to the Lincoln Room . Stiles , Sweeney , and Parson had all the downstairs phones tied up . PRESIDENT HALE Did you check the office General Pratt was in to see if he was on the phone ? ATTORNEY GENERAL COLE No . And I did n't say " Sorry . " GENERAL PRATT That could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the opportunity to remove the driver from the golf bag  --  GENERAL PRATT I did n't know about it . PRESIDENT HALE Except General Pratt . PROFESSOR SWEENEY I do n't play golf . I would n't recognize a driver if it hit me . I mean  --  PRESIDENT HALE Except General Pratt and Professor Sweeney. p. 72 ATTORNEY GENERAL COLE If Sweeney 's telling the truth about not playing golf . PROFESSOR SWEENEY I 'm sure the Justice Department will have it in its files . ATTORNEY GENERAL COLE Do n't think I wo n't check . PRESIDENT HALE Careful , Mr. Cole . ATTORNEY GENERAL COLE I 'm sorry , Mr. President . But this is just the sort of mutual distrust I warned you against . PRESIDENT HALE Warned me ? Warned the President ! I want you to know something . All of you . How disappointed I am . How grievously disappointed . How my trust in all of you  --  all of you has been shaken by your refusal to cooperate . Your truculence  --  SECRETARY OF DEFENSE PARSON Mr. President . If I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , nods curtly.I 'm terribly worried the way this thing is going . I do n't think it has to go that way . It seems to me we can turn this tragedy into an opportunity . Too often in the past we 're the victims of events , and it looks like today we 're that all over again . We 're in a rough war . And morale is n't what it should be . It 's flagging . And one reason morale is flagging is because of lack of support back home . It 's a factor our enemies bank on . They know they ca n't beat us in the field , but they can beat us in our own backyards . That 's because our wars are n't real to the people . The people see them on TV , and it 's like just another show . I 've read some research on this , and it 's a fact . So what I say is this : if we could bring this war home to the people , strengthen homefront support , why , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So that 's the question : do we go on and let events push us around or do we use our initiative and take control of our destinies instead of vice versa ? p. 73 PRESIDENT HALE I 'm sorry but I do n't understand what you 're saying . SECRETARY OF DEFENSE PARSON My recommendation , Mr. President , is that the First Lady was assassinated by a suicide squad of Brazilian terrorists . Lights fade on President 's office . p. 74 Act 2 , Scene 4 Act Two : Scene Four Lights up on battlefield . An eerie yellow light . LIEUTENANT CUTLER You want to see a fantastic sight ? Can you raise up a little ? CAPTAIN WEEMS I think so . LIEUTENANT CUTLER Look at our two hands over there . CAPTAIN WEEMS How 'd they get over there ? LIEUTENANT CUTLER They must have rolled over . CAPTAIN WEEMS I do n't remember them breaking off , do you ? LIEUTENANT CUTLER That 's what 's so great about it . Like it 's perfectly normal . CAPTAIN WEEMS Like a new form of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinking . All the hands in the world becoming one hand . CAPTAIN WEEMS And ours are the first two . Look at them grip each other . LIEUTENANT CUTLER They do n't need us . CAPTAIN WEEMS They need each other . LIEUTENANT CUTLER To them , they 're us . CAPTAIN WEEMS Are we still us ? p. 75 LIEUTENANT CUTLER We 're part of us . We always will be . CAPTAIN WEEMS But the main part  --  LIEUTENANT CUTLER The main part . Who can say what the main part is ? CAPTAIN WEEMS I 've never felt so  --  I do n't know . LIEUTENANT CUTLER What ? CAPTAIN WEEMS It sounds funny to say it  --  so all together . My leg is coming loose . LIEUTENANT CUTLER Throw it over with my leg . CAPTAIN WEEMS I ca n't see your leg . I ca n't really see too well anymore . And I 'm having trouble talking . LIEUTENANT CUTLER I do n't have any trouble understanding . CAPTAIN WEEMS Does my voice sound funny to you ? LIEUTENANT CUTLER It sounds more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm getting down to roots . LIEUTENANT CUTLER That 's what I mean . CAPTAIN WEEMS Look what just came off . ( Holds object over his head . ) LIEUTENANT CUTLER I ca n't see too good either . What is it ? p. 76 CAPTAIN WEEMS My pecker . I was scratching it , and it came off . LIEUTENANT CUTLER You think there 's a secret ? CAPTAIN WEEMS Not anymore . p. 77 Act 2 , Scene 5 Act Two : Scene Five Lights up on President 's office . Exactly as before . ATTORNEY GENERAL COLE It wo n't work . POSTMASTER GENERAL STILES Maybe . But it 's in the right direction . Finally we 're beginning to get somewhere . SECRETARY OF DEFENSE PARSON Why wo n't it work ? ATTORNEY GENERAL COLE We ca n't blame everything that goes wrong on Brazilian suicide squads . SECRETARY OF DEFENSE PARSON So why not let them have this one and find somebody else for the CB97 ? ATTORNEY GENERAL COLE Because the CB97 is too far along . PROFESSOR SWEENEY The decision has been made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ switch . It 's got to be something like a Brazilian suicide squad if we want the American people to get behind this war . ATTORNEY GENERAL COLE Why ca n't we make it be Communists ? Or a peace group ? POSTMASTER GENERAL STILES I do n't care who we have do it . But one thing I 'm strong on . We ca n't have her killed in the White House . SECRETARY OF DEFENSE PARSON Why not ? p. 78 POSTMASTER GENERAL STILES Not six weeks before election . It makes us look ineffectual . ATTORNEY GENERAL COLE Stiles is right . She 's got to be killed somewhere else . PROFESSOR SWEENEY But where ? ATTORNEY GENERAL COLE Tim , where are we most in trouble ? POSTMASTER GENERAL STILES In the cities , according to Gallup . ATTORNEY GENERAL COLE So we 're not risking very much if we have her killed in New York ? POSTMASTER GENERAL STILES New York , Chicago , San Francisco . Does n't matter . ATTORNEY GENERAL COLE We may even pull a sympathy vote . POSTMASTER GENERAL STILES For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Better make it Chicago . SECRETARY OF DEFENSE PARSON There are lots of Communists in Chicago . Ca n't we do something with that ? POSTMASTER GENERAL STILES I 'd like to help you out on this morale business , Biff , but the more I look at it , the less likely it seems . ATTORNEY GENERAL COLE Let 's not forget the picket sign . PROFESSOR SWEENEY " Make Love Not War . " p. 79 ATTORNEY GENERAL COLE I favor a peace group . GENERAL PRATT Or students . SECRETARY OF DEFENSE PARSON Why not make it the blacks ? POSTMASTER GENERAL STILES Chicago 's full of them . PROFESSOR SWEENEY Why always look for left-wing villains ? Why not pick on the Birch Society ? SECRETARY OF DEFENSE PARSON Come off it , Sweeney . The Birch Society ? " Make Love Not War " ? PROFESSOR SWEENEY I just do n't see why everyone has to pick on the left . Anyhow , no one will believe they did it . She was antiwar , pro-Negro , and pro-student . POSTMASTER GENERAL STILES He 's right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PARSON I think they 'll believe it . GENERAL PRATT It could very easily be the Negroes . POSTMASTER GENERAL STILES You 're out of touch . It 's out of the question . ATTORNEY GENERAL COLE So who did it ? PROFESSOR SWEENEY Why does she have to have been murdered ? POSTMASTER GENERAL STILES That 's very good , Sweeney. p. 80 ATTORNEY GENERAL COLE An accident ? SECRETARY OF DEFENSE PARSON A plane crash ? PROFESSOR SWEENEY A car crash ? GENERAL PRATT A hunting accident ? SECRETARY OF DEFENSE PARSON A fatal illness . GENERAL PRATT Pneumonia ? ATTORNEY GENERAL COLE Takes too long . GENERAL PRATT Cancer ? POSTMASTER GENERAL STILES Bad image . ATTORNEY GENERAL COLE And it takes too long . SECRETARY OF DEFENSE PARSON A heart attack ! PROFESSOR SWEENEY I know ! Food poisoning ! ATTORNEY GENERAL COLE Food poisoning  --  SECRETARY OF DEFENSE PARSON Food poisoning  --  POSTMASTER GENERAL STILES I like it ! GENERAL PRATT Food poisoning in Chicago . It could have happened . PROFESSOR SWEENEY ( proudly ) What do you think , Mr. President ? PRESIDENT HALE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think you people are n't human . This is my wife you 're talking about . Will you listen to yourselves ? The First Lady ! Do you have the slightest notion of what you sound like ? A human being . She was a human being ! This sounds like a madhouse ! One of you has murdered a fleshand-blood woman and not a single one of you cares ! What have you done to your humanity ? Embarrassed pause . p. 81 ATTORNEY GENERAL COLE If you pardon me for saying so , Mr. President , I think you 're oversimplifying . I fully sympathize with your feelings  --  SECRETARY OF DEFENSE PARSON We all do . ATTORNEY GENERAL COLE And we stand in awe of the remarkable manner in which you 've conducted this investigation  --  thus far . GENERAL PRATT But we have to be realists . ATTORNEY GENERAL COLE We must be realists . That does n't mean we lack human feeling or a sense of compassion . GENERAL PRATT We do not lack human feeling . ATTORNEY GENERAL COLE But there is a difference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and how he may act in private life . PROFESSOR SWEENEY We in public life have the most difficult burden of all . SECRETARY OF DEFENSE PARSON It is our job to protect the national interest . PROFESSOR SWEENEY It is our job to get things done . ATTORNEY GENERAL COLE It is our job to do what 's best . GENERAL PRATT That does n't mean we 're not human . PROFESSOR SWEENEY Every action we recommend is on behalf of humanity . p. 82 SECRETARY OF DEFENSE PARSON Only the enemies of humanity will gain by our differences . PROFESSOR SWEENEY It 's very complicated . ATTORNEY GENERAL COLE We can not afford to oversimplify . GENERAL PRATT America would be destroyed . PRESIDENT HALE I 'd like to get this straight so that there is no chance later for confusion . It is your unanimous recommendation  --  am I correct ?  --  that the First Lady did not die in the White House  --  OTHERS Yes  --  yes  --  that is correct  --  PRESIDENT HALE That she was not murdered . OTHERS No  --  not murdered  --  impossible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someway  --  OTHERS Yes  --  Yes  --  Yes  --  PRESIDENT HALE An accident  --  OTHERS Very good !  --  Good !  --  Good !  --  PRESIDENT HALE I will take your recommendation under advisement . In the meantime , we have gone this far with our investigation . I would like to go a little further . p. 83 OTHERS ( not quite in chorus ) No ! PRESIDENT HALE Is it a risk to the national security to discuss these things among ourselves ? OTHERS ( not quite in chorus ) Yes ! PRESIDENT HALE There are so many risks . We will just have to be brave . We now come to a key point in our investigation . A point brought up earlier by Postmaster General Stiles . How was so conspicuous an object as a picket sign brought into the White House ? Now this is a very large placard indeed . No one could smuggle it in under his coat . How did one of you bring it in ? Mr. Cole ? You have contributed so much already . No response.Secretary Parson , you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you constantly astonish me with the creative use you find for your research . No response.Mr . Stiles , you are the most pragmatic man in this room full of pragmatic men . No response.General Pratt , is the nation 's military arm struck mute ? No response.Well then , I will have to work it out for myself . Let 's take a look at this placard . ( He rips it off the support . ) It is too large to fit into any of your briefcases . And it has not been folded . It might have been worn on the inside of a shirt , but that would make one of you move so stiffly it would surely have been noticed . Although , General Pratt , it would n't have been noticed on you . All stare at PRATT.However , I see how tightly your uniform fits . And this placard is not creased . You are cleared once again , General Pratt . It is a mystery . How do you bring an eighteen by twenty-four placard reading " Make Love Not War " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Parson , would you like to try again ? No response.You disappoint me , Secretary Parson . I hoped you would answer , " It would not be noticed if I brought it in hidden among my Brazilian war charts . " Others except for PARSON slowly rise to their feet . PARSON and PRESIDENT remain seated , exchanging grim stares . p. 84 Lights fade on President 's office . p. 85 Act 2 , Scene 6 Act Two : Scene Six Lights up on battlefield . An eerie red light . Cutler 's and Weems 's heads , arms , and bodies lie scattered about the battlefield . CAPTAIN WEEMS Can you see me , Buzz ? LIEUTENANT CUTLER Not anymore . CAPTAIN WEEMS I ca n't see anything . Did you see where my head rolled ? LIEUTENANT CUTLER No . CAPTAIN WEEMS I hope it rolled near my hand . I have an itch on my nose . LIEUTENANT CUTLER I ca n't feel anything . CAPTAIN WEEMS You think this is dying ? LIEUTENANT CUTLER I do n't know what it is , but it looks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front of my eyes , and I do n't recognize any of it . LIEUTENANT CUTLER Does it have the Boy Scouts in it ? CAPTAIN WEEMS Yes . LIEUTENANT CUTLER Does it have touch football ? CAPTAIN WEEMS Yes . LIEUTENANT CUTLER Does it have Sunday mornings in church  --  the family car  --  self-reliance  --  the old swimming hole  --  homemade cooking  --  beating up the school bully  --  the girl next door  --  overcoming disappointment ? p. 86 CAPTAIN WEEMS Yes . LIEUTENANT CUTLER I think you 've got my past . I must have yours . CAPTAIN WEEMS We 've traded our pasts . LIEUTENANT CUTLER We 've shared our pasts . CAPTAIN WEEMS Everybody has the same history . That 's the secret . LIEUTENANT CUTLER But nobody knows it . CAPTAIN WEEMS Nobody knows the secret . LIEUTENANT CUTLER And the ones who find out  --  they do n't talk about it . CAPTAIN WEEMS Or talk about anything . LIEUTENANT CUTLER Because they know . CAPTAIN WEEMS They know it all . LIEUTENANT CUTLER So there 's no reason  --  CAPTAIN WEEMS To talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make an impression . LIEUTENANT CUTLER Or anything . CAPTAIN WEEMS Because knowing is enough . LIEUTENANT CUTLER That 's why nobody else knows . p. 87 CAPTAIN WEEMS If we did talk about it , what do you think would happen ? LIEUTENANT CUTLER I think it 'd end all war . CAPTAIN WEEMS It would end violence . LIEUTENANT CUTLER It would end mental illness . CAPTAIN WEEMS All men would be brothers . LIEUTENANT CUTLER There 'd be universal love . CAPTAIN WEEMS And equality . LIEUTENANT CUTLER And generosity of feelings . CAPTAIN WEEMS If they just knew the secret . How does it look ? LIEUTENANT CUTLER What ? CAPTAIN WEEMS My past . LIEUTENANT CUTLER It looks real good , Rick . Warm . Human . CAPTAIN WEEMS Are you positive ? LIEUTENANT CUTLER A typical family : sharing hard times but loving your country ; rising early in the morning to work the land  --  your father already out on the field , you and your five brothers gotten out of bed by your mother , a work worn woman with laughing eyes  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LIEUTENANT CUTLER Is your mother 's name Consuela ? CAPTAIN WEEMS No . LIEUTENANT CUTLER Did you ever plant coffee as a kid ? CAPTAIN WEEMS You got some Chico 's past . LIEUTENANT CUTLER It looks good . CAPTAIN WEEMS Where could he be ? LIEUTENANT CUTLER Out there . Somewhere . You know what that means , Rick ? CAPTAIN WEEMS It means we 're all one . LIEUTENANT CUTLER It means I did n't gas only our own guys . I got me a Chico . I got me at least one Chico . CAPTAIN WEEMS You have his past . LIEUTENANT CUTLER I got one . Maybe more than one ! CAPTAIN WEEMS All of us lying here  --  exchanging secrets  --  LIEUTENANT CUTLER Who knows how many ? Maybe I got dozens . Maybe I got up to a hundred ! A hundred to take with me when I go ! CAPTAIN WEEMS That 's not the way to go . LIEUTENANT CUTLER You kidding ? All balls is n't the way to go ? How many Chicos you taking with you ? p. 89 CAPTAIN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LIEUTENANT CUTLER You 're jealous ! CAPTAIN WEEMS Chico , you , and me  --  we 're one ! LIEUTENANT CUTLER You 're one , you fucking flit ! Why are you trying to screw me out of my Chicos ? CAPTAIN WEEMS You 're losing the secret ! LIEUTENANT CUTLER I do n't lose any secrets . I keep all secrets . All secrets are classified cosmic ! Weems 's head moves toward Cutler 's head . CAPTAIN WEEMS We 're all together , Buzz . You 've got my hand ! LIEUTENANT CUTLER I do n't want your faggot hand ! You 're not a man . You 're not an American . You 're Chico ! CAPTAIN WEEMS I 'm Chico , you 're Chico  --  LIEUTENANT CUTLER Chico ! Cutler 's separated arm draws his gun . CAPTAIN WEEMS We 're all  --  Cutler 's arm fires at the various parts of WEEMS . Silence . LIEUTENANT CUTLER Looking good . Looking real good . All balls . Lights fade on battlefield. p. 90 Act 2 , Scene 7 Act Two : Scene Seven Lights up on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ STILES Mr. President . PRESIDENT HALE ( still staring at PARSON ) Mr. Stiles ? POSTMASTER GENERAL STILES I have an urgent matter I would like to take up with you . It must be in private . PRESIDENT HALE ( sarcastic ) We can all be trusted here , Mr. Stiles . POSTMASTER GENERAL STILES It must be in private . PRESIDENT HALE ( turns his stare onto STILES ) Does it have some bearing on this matter ? POSTMASTER GENERAL STILES I have never been frivolous with your time . PRESIDENT HALE Will you gentlemen please wait together in the anteroom . And this time , if you please , no phone calls . They exit . STILES sits . POSTMASTER GENERAL STILES I have known you ever since you entered politics . PRESIDENT HALE You brought me into politics . p. 91 POSTMASTER GENERAL STILES I wish I could forget it . You 're making a damn fool of yourself ! PRESIDENT HALE Be careful ! POSTMASTER GENERAL STILES Oh , for Christ 's sake , get off your high horse . Emerson , you 're in deep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you out . PRESIDENT HALE I do n't care about the election . All I care about is that Parson murdered Evelyn . POSTMASTER GENERAL STILES He did ? How did he ? PRESIDENT HALE You know how . POSTMASTER GENERAL STILES Do I ? How did he know she was in here ? She did n't come through the anteroom . I was in the anteroom with Parson and I did n't see her come through . PRESIDENT HALE She was waiting in my private study . That door . She always waited for me in there . POSTMASTER GENERAL STILES So how did Parson know she was in here ? PRESIDENT HALE He had to know ! POSTMASTER GENERAL STILES He could n't know . None of us could . Well , that 's not true . One of us could . PRESIDENT HALE Who ? ! POSTMASTER GENERAL STILES You could . p. 92 PRESIDENT HALE You 're beginning to waste my time . POSTMASTER GENERAL STILES Is that why you 're so eager to pin this on Parson ? PRESIDENT HALE Get out . POSTMASTER GENERAL STILES @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was my wife , I 'd have thought very seriously of killing her . PRESIDENT HALE I loved Evelyn ! POSTMASTER GENERAL STILES Ridiculing you in public . Making you a figure of contempt . PRESIDENT HALE It 's not true ! POSTMASTER GENERAL STILES She did n't make you a figure of contempt ? PRESIDENT HALE Oh , that part is true enough . But if that 's a motive for murder there 'd be a mass slaughter of wives throughout the country . POSTMASTER GENERAL STILES Who had a better opportunity to smuggle the placard into the White House than the President ? PRESIDENT HALE I wo n't listen to any more of this drivel . POSTMASTER GENERAL STILES It 's no more drivel than the claptrap you 've been feeding us ! PRESIDENT HALE How could I have gotten my hands on Cole 's driver while all of you were in the anteroom ? p. 93 POSTMASTER GENERAL STILES We left . You forced that out of us yourself . PRESIDENT HALE You did n't leave . You were on the phone . POSTMASTER GENERAL STILES That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HALE So I could n't have taken Cole 's driver . POSTMASTER GENERAL STILES No . PRESIDENT HALE And Parson did ! POSTMASTER GENERAL STILES How could I see you and miss Parson ? All right , say he did take the driver . What did he do next ? Go into your office , knock off the head of the driver , fish around in his charts for the placard , staple the placard onto the driver , and run your wife through while she 's sitting there watching this whole operation ? PRESIDENT HALE No , he could n't do it that way . POSTMASTER GENERAL STILES Forget Parson ! He did n't know she was in there . PRESIDENT HALE Then who knew ? POSTMASTER GENERAL STILES No one knew . PRESIDENT HALE No one ? POSTMASTER GENERAL STILES Not even the murderer . Mrs. Hale was not supposed to be the victim . p. 94 PRESIDENT HALE My God ! He was after me ! POSTMASTER GENERAL STILES Yes ! PRESIDENT HALE But how could anyone possibly confuse  --  POSTMASTER GENERAL STILES The lights had to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Parson turns off the lights , he gets the placard  --  POSTMASTER GENERAL STILES I told you to forget Parson ! How is he going to find the placard with the lights out ? PRESIDENT HALE Who , besides Parson , could have carried that placard into the White House ? POSTMASTER GENERAL STILES It did n't have to be carried in . It could have gotten in some other way . PRESIDENT HALE There is no other way ! POSTMASTER GENERAL STILES The U.S. mails . PRESIDENT HALE It was mailed ? POSTMASTER GENERAL STILES Why not ? The murderer mailed it  --  say a couple of days ago . He could have even included the stick  --  but having the President 's fingerprints on the murder weapon seemed like a better idea . So he mails the placard out in some sort of easily identifiable package , and it he knows anything at all about mail delivery in the White House , he knows it 'll be weeks before it 's unwrapped . So when he 's good and ready , he goes down to the mail room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knocks off the head with one of the tools down in the mail room , and uses the staple gun to affix it to the placard . p. 95 PRESIDENT HALE But why go to all this bother ? POSTMASTER GENERAL STILES Who does anything simple in Washington ? PRESIDENT HALE It 's impossible ! He was bound to be seen in the mail room . POSTMASTER GENERAL STILES Let 's say he does n't care if he 's seen . PRESIDENT HALE But he must care ! POSTMASTER GENERAL STILES Let 's say he does n't care because he takes it for granted that no one who saw him fooling around in the mail room will ever connect him with the White House murder because nobody but the five of us will ever know about the White House murder . I say five , not six , because you 're not supposed to know either . You 're supposed to be the victim . PRESIDENT HALE It could n't be covered up ! POSTMASTER GENERAL STILES The Vice-President is a loyal party member , a dedicated American , and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or ambitious a man than his predecessor . That 's you . He would not want to destroy his party , injure his country , and wipe out his chance to be president by placing on trial as an assassin the national chairman of the party . PRESIDENT HALE My God , Tim , what are you saying ? p. 96 POSTMASTER GENERAL STILES I killed your wife . PRESIDENT HALE I do n't believe it . POSTMASTER GENERAL STILES It was in the dark . She was at your desk , the damned buttinsky . How was I to know ? It was a mistake , but maybe it wo n't matter . PRESIDENT HALE My God , it was me you meant to kill ! But why ? We 're friends ! POSTMASTER GENERAL STILES You were going to lose an election . PRESIDENT HALE I was n't . I would have pulled it out ! POSTMASTER GENERAL STILES The country is tired of one crisis after another . Last Monday I saw the latest polls and it was crystal clear we were through unless we had a fresh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HALE So you planned to assassinate me in the White House . POSTMASTER GENERAL STILES Who killed you and where it took place is a technicality . As far as the public was to be concerned , you got it in some other place from a member of the opposition party , who is probably half-crazed and has strong radical sympathies . PRESIDENT HALE And that would produce a sympathy vote that would sweep the Vice-President into office . p. 97 POSTMASTER GENERAL STILES That 's the scenario . PRESIDENT HALE Was the Vice-President in on this plot ? POSTMASTER GENERAL STILES That dunderhead ? He would have panicked . PRESIDENT HALE So you plotted and executed this all by yourself . POSTMASTER GENERAL STILES That 's it . PRESIDENT HALE All for the good of the party . POSTMASTER GENERAL STILES What 's good for the party is good for the country . The party 's been my life for forty years . I 'm not going to sit by and watch amateurs destroy it . PRESIDENT HALE You are referring to me . POSTMASTER GENERAL STILES When I recruited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took your wife 's advice more seriously than you took mine . Look where it got you . PRESIDENT HALE This is startling  --  startling . I do n't know why , but I ca n't feel angry . Or vengeful . I must be in shock . You will have to be punished . POSTMASTER GENERAL STILES Are you going to have me arrested ? PRESIDENT HALE Arrested ? How can I ? POSTMASTER GENERAL STILES You seemed pretty eager to spread the truth a little while ago . p. 98 PRESIDENT HALE Among ourselves , yes . Of course ! We 're equipped to deal with it . But the public  --  it would n't do them any good to hear this sort of thing . It would shake their faith badly . We would n't be able to carry on . We 've made our share of mistakes , but good Lord , can you imagine those other fellows in power ? No , it 's vital that we carry on . POSTMASTER GENERAL STILES ( hands him confession ) I 've written out a complete confession . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so cross out your name and stick in your wife 's . PRESIDENT HALE I do n't want it . POSTMASTER GENERAL STILES I intend to release it to the press . PRESIDENT HALE What are you trying to do to me , Stiles ? POSTMASTER GENERAL STILES We will not go along as we have in the past . PRESIDENT HALE What is it you want ? POSTMASTER GENERAL STILES A hand in the making of the foreign policy of this government . PRESIDENT HALE You 're a politician , not a diplomat ! POSTMASTER GENERAL STILES It 's your diplomacy that 's destroying our politics . I 'm not going to risk future elections because of your mistakes ! p. 99 PRESIDENT HALE I 'll consult you as I have in the past . POSTMASTER GENERAL STILES No . PRESIDENT HALE You wo n't get any more out of me . POSTMASTER GENERAL STILES Then I 'll release this confession . PRESIDENT HALE You 'd destroy the party . POSTMASTER GENERAL STILES You have n't left much party for me to destroy . PRESIDENT HALE It 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) What do you want ? POSTMASTER GENERAL STILES Secretary of Defense . PRESIDENT HALE I ca n't do that to Parson . I 've already accused him of murder . I ca n't take his job away . POSTMASTER GENERAL STILES I want Secretary of Defense . PRESIDENT HALE I wo n't do it . Show some human understanding , for God 's sake ! You want some direction over foreign policy ? I 'll make you Ambassador to the UN . POSTMASTER GENERAL STILES I did n't kill your wife to become an errand boy . Do n't treat me with contempt . PRESIDENT HALE Ambassador to Brazil . STILES glowers.Presidential Troubleshooter !
