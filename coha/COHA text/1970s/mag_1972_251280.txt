Strange are the things a candidate will stomach to win a few votes . Consider the fortitude of Roman ( " Pooch " ) Pucinski , the Democratic Illinois Congressman who is waging an uphill battle to unseat first-term Republican Senator Charles Percy . <P> Arriving at Loyola University in Chicago for a " rap session , " the silver-haired Democrat found that his audience had been lured away by a campus goldfish-swallowing contest . " The student chairman was very apologetic , " says Pucinski , " and we went to the contest to announce that I was there . " Upon his appearance , the students began chanting , " Eat a fish ! Eat a fish ! " Never one to ignore an opening , Pooch downed one of the little wrigglers . " A goldfish is sort of like a martini , " said Pucinski later , swallowing hard . " After the first one , they 're not bad . Once I 'd swallowed it , I could n't feel it wriggle at all . "        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
