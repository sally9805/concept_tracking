THE HARDER THEY COME <P> Directed by PERRY HENZELL Screenplay by PERRY HENZELL and TREVOR D.RHONE <P> Fast , tough , sinuous , with a score of Jamaican reggae that jauntily accentuates its vigor , this saga of the career of a small-time pot pusher and pop star is a kind of Caribbean Threepenny Opera . It does not have the depth , but it does have some of the energy and a little of the fury , the same sort of lovingly savage feeling for the brash ethos of the underworld . <P> The hero , called Ivan , is stylishly played by Jimmy Cliff , a Jamaican musician who has an insinuating , almost feral appeal . Poor and aimless , Ivan wanders about Jamaica , hoping vaguely to be a singer . It is an ambition he fulfills the way he finds a girl friend , the way he starts pushing , and the way , finally , he gets killed : by falling into it . The movie even attempts a kind of Brechtian device : Ivan attends a film , one of those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowing that he is immune to all real danger until the last reel . When Ivan meets his own end , cut down by a crew of hapless cops in the last reel of The Harder They Come , Director Perry Henzell cuts in shots of Ivan laughing at and applauding the western . <P> It is an interesting and ambitious notion , but one that does not quite fit into the structure of the film ; it is almost a frill . What works better is the idea that Ivan is not only mesmerized by such mock-heroic displays , but much influenced and shaped by them . Throughout the film , he is ground down and exploited . His fantasy of breaking out of his grim world by becoming a celebrity is exploded when the music producer , who controls distribution of nearly all records on the island , offers him $20 for his song-take it or leave it . Too proud at first to accept , Ivan becomes desperate enough to pocket the money and wait around to become famous . When that does not happen , Ivan 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by accident , a desperado . This means of escape turns out to be a true means to an end . It kills him and it makes him famous , lets him live out his fantasies of movie heroism with childish pleasure and flamboyance until he dies , gun in hand , on a secluded beach . <P> The Harder They Come ( the title itself has a certain chiding irony ) benefits immeasurably from having been made in Jamaica . Indeed , it is the first full-fledged Jamaican feature , and it gives a view of the island-shabby houses , tense little nightclubs and baked-out countryside-that is not part of the standard paradise tour . For all its naive charm , the movie is not consistently successful . Its crudities of characterization and carelessness about certain matters of plot give it a kind of jerry-built look . But The Harder They Come is always exuberant , and sometimes strong , as casually surprising and effortlessly sinister as the blade sliding out of a gravity knife . - Jay Cocks            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
