With a judicious mixture of courage and caution , Secretary Caspar W. Weinberger 's Department of Health , Education , and Welfare last week stepped into the middle of the battle against sex discrimination . It published a set of proposals designed to exorcise the substance if not the spirit of sexism from almost every educational institution in the U.S. <P> In 80 pages of regulations , HEW spelled out antidiscrimination bans under the Education Act of 1972 . Carefully choosing its way through a minefield of custom , law and sensibilities in the sexual realm , HEW mapped the reforms that schools will have to make or else risk loss of federal funds and prosecution . The four main areas of change : <P> SEX SEGREGATION . Compulsory segregation by sex is to be banned in both classes and school-funded extracurricular activities . Gone will be such hoary educational standbys as all-girl home-economics classes and all-boy shop classes , along with all-boy and all-girl phys. - ed or hygiene courses . <P> ADMISSIONS . Sexual discrimination will be prohibited in the recruitment and admission of students to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. Also barred will be discrimination that takes the form of separate ranking of applicants by sex , sex-biased admission tests and consideration of whether or not an applicant is married , pregnant , or already a parent . Further , schools will be expected " to remedy the effects of past discrimination . " <P> EMPLOYMENT . The proposed rules come down hard on discrimination against women teachers and other women employees . Women who perform the same work as men will receive equal pay and equal benefits . Since current federal regulations already deal with these problems in higher education , the new guidelines will have the heaviest impact in elementary and secondary schools . <P> ATHLETICS . On the playing field and in the locker room ( TIME , March 11 ) , already the scenes of impassioned brouhahas , the new rules are not so stringent . Though a coed school " may not provide varsity sports opportunities exclusively for male students , " it is " not required to provide women access to men 's teams . " It can simply abide by the old , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to mean equal expenditures either . <P> Feminist Gloria Steinem was quick to take offense at what she called " Jock-ocracy . " She saw the failure to guarantee equal funds for women 's sports as a commitment to " equality if it does n't cost anything . " In Michigan , Jo Jacobs of the Committee to Study Sex Discrimination in Kalamazoo Public Schools also found the proposals wanting but was " not surprised . Most institutions , including HEW and the NCAA ( National Collegiate Athletic Association ) , are controlled by males . " Kay Hutchcraft , program coordinator of the Association for Intercollegiate Athletics for Women , offered a rare but cautious cheer for the new policy : it will mean " more participation for more women . "
