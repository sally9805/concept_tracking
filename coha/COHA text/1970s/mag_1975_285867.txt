Holly Hill , Orangeburg , Columbia , Clinton-the exits along 1-26 in South Carolina loom in the muggy night like guideposts to ghost towns as the 1958 General Motors coach grinds west . Its odometer creaks past 620,000 miles . The Spartanburg Phillies of the Western Carolinas League-25 eager minor league baseball players-are heading home after losing a night game to the Charleston Pirates . They have not eaten since they left Spartanburg nearly twelve hours ago for the outbound leg of the 420-mile , one-day road trip . Pitcher Jerry Houston and Infielder Raul Nieves are asleep , crammed into the overhead luggage racks . Centerfielder Lonnie Smith has his radio pressed against the window , searching through the static for rock music . Up front , Manager Lee Elia stares at the embers of a cigarette as he flicks it to the floor . It will be 2 a.m. before the day ends . Fourteen hours , more than seven of them on the road , for a 1-hr. 58-min. baseball game . <P> Proud Anachronism . The trip in a way is a journey backward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of life that most of America has left behind - doomed by the onset of jet travel , domed stadiums and exorbitant salaries . How much longer it lasts depends on the major league franchises , which still use farm teams to ripen talent . Victims of TV broadcasts from major league cities , which give fans painless access to top-quality play , the minors have lost too many fans to pay their way ; most clubs are now supported in red ink by big-league teams . Last year the Philadelphia Phillies alone poured $2 million into their farm system-including Spartanburg . Even so , the bush leagues continue to die off . From a peak of 59 leagues , 448 teams , and 42 million spectators in 1949 , the minors withered to 18 circuits , 145 teams and 11 million fans last summer . <P> In Spartanburg and other survival towns , the minors are a dusty , dilapidated but proud anachronism . Here a kid fresh out of high school can still dream of making the big leagues , and a fan can see the color of a player @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Park in Charleston , the mosquitoes outnumber the fans , the floodlights leave the centerfielder groping in the dark , and a park employee has to run out into rightfield every half-inning to update the Scoreboard . In Greenwood , Dave Fendrick , the young general manager of the Braves , has to collect tickets at the front gate , the dugouts are too small to shelter all the players , and in Spartanburg , Charlie ( " Doc " ) Royals wears four hats as the Phillies ' bus driver , clubhouse manager , laundry man and trainer .
