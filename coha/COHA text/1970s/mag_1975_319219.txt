Long regarded as an exacting and prestigious calling , the accounting profession has smarted in recent years under charges of sloppy or illegal practices that contributed to some of the biggest scandals in U.S. business history . As the world 's largest accounting firm ( annual revenues : $500 million ) , New York-based Peat , Marwick , Mitchell &; Co. took a heavy share of the blame . To help restore its image , Peat , Marwick about six months ago took the unprecedented step of hiring a competitor - Arthur Young &; Co. , one of the smaller among accounting 's Big Eight - to scrutinize its practices . For a $500,000 fee , more than 150 Young accountants put in 12,000 hours of labor , studying the way Peat , Marwick audits its clients ' books and interviewing 50 Peat , Marwick partners . <P> Dramatic Losses . Last week the results of the accounting profession 's first " peer review " were in , and , to no one 's surprise , they were generally complimentary . Young found some weaknesses in Peat , Marwick procedures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had not kept adequate records . But in general Young concluded that Peat , Marwick complied with accounting principles laid down by the Financial Accounting Standards Board . " We did not find perfection , " Young Managing Partner William S. Kanaga said in a letter to Peat , Marwick Senior Partner Walter E. Hanson . " But no professional auditor who is knowledgeable of the problems of auditing and reporting would expect to find perfection . " <P> Young 's findings came too late to save Peat , Marwick from being the target of a Government suit concerning its auditing several years ago of Penn Central , National Student Marketing , Talley Industries and Republic National Life Insurance-all of which have either gone bankrupt or suffered dramatic losses . The Government accused Peat , Marwick of such practices as counting sales before they were made or blithely taking management 's word for certain figures without independent verification . The suit was settled by a consent decree under which Peat , Marwick was forbidden with some exceptions to take on new clients for six months this year . The Securities and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marwick practices as part of the consent decree - but it applauds the idea of auditors studying each other as well . <P> The Young review could thus accelerate self-policing of the accounting profession . The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants has urged " peer review " on member firms , but it wanted the results kept confidential . <P> Peat , Marwick not only volunteered to subject itself to the first review but insisted that the findings be made public . Partner Hanson cautions that Young 's scrutiny of his firm technically was not an audit ; Young studied only how Peat , Marwick peruses its clients ' books , not how it keeps its own . Nonetheless , Hanson believes the study shows the profession is determined to regulate itself before the Government does so . Whatever happens , he says , Peat , Marwick intends to submit itself again to judgment by its peers every two or three years .
