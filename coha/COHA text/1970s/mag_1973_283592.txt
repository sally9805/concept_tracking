Six months ago , in a televised statement of aims and aspirations that took nearly three hours to deliver , President Anwar Sadat informed 35 million fellow Egyptians that " the stage of total confrontation " with Israel was soon to begin . To prepare for it , Sadat , 55 , reshuffled his government and named himself Premier and Military Governor General in addition to President and Commander in Chief of the armed forces . He visited front-line posts in uniform and was photographed peering through field glasses at Israeli fortifications . " We believe in our destiny , " said Sadat . " We do not shrink from any sacrifice . " <P> Far from being stirred by Sadat 's ringing oratory most Egyptians were unmoved . After all , in the three years since Sadat assumed the presidency following the sudden death of Gamal Abdel Nasser , he had constantly called for war to avenge the crushing defeat that Egypt suffered in the Six-Day War . Sadat said that 1971 would be " the year of decision , " but it ended indecisively . Last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the inevitable battle . " It did not come . <P> Among the sophisticated citizens of Cairo , this succession of calls to valor followed by a void led to a kind of black humor . One joke that circulated through the capital had Sadat ordering an attack and his commanders offering up an excuse for every day of the week . Saturday 's excuse , ironically : it was scarcely proper to launch an attack against Israel on the Jewish sabbath . <P> Sadat himself did little to close this credibility gap . As a result , friends and enemies alike long ago decided that his calls for confrontation were insincere . For one thing , Egypt seemed to be pathetically ill-prepared for any battle , militarily or economically . The troops mobilized along the Suez Canal seemed to be in uniform as much to keep many of them out of civilian unemployment statistics as to harass Israel . Largely because of faulty distribution facilities , there were shortages of everything from cooking oil to the tomatoes that Egyptians love . Corruption was rampant , protests increased , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to criticize their lack of job futures , they were hauled off to jail by tough riot police . <P> Sadat has been forced to shake a fist from time to time or seduce Egyptians with the heady vision of confrontation and victory because he lacks the personal magnetism with which his predecessor , Abdel Nasser , captured the Arab world . Sadat is basically an uncomplicated person who enjoys a sedate family life with wife Gehan and their children . He is a devout Moslem to the point that his forehead bears the mark caused by a lifetime of touching the head to floor to pray .
