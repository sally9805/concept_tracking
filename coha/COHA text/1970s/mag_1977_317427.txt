A tale of two suburbs : signs of failure and success <P> For many communities , racial integration is a worthy but difficult goal , a challenge to the foresightedness and ingenuity of their civic leaders . Rather than waiting for the courts to prescribe remedies for segregation , more predominantly white communities are trying to take the initiative and integrate themselves-with varying success . Two current and contrasting examples : Los Angeles ' San Fernando Valley , where an advertising campaign to promote voluntary integration shows all the signs of failure , and the Chicago suburb of Oak Park , where urban specialists gathered earlier this month to study a promising local program . <P> <P> The Valley : No Shortcuts <P> One of the few places in California 's San Fernando Valley that was open to blacks during the postwar real estate boom is an area near Pacoima , which real estate people mockingly referred to as the " Joe Louis Homes . " In the decades since , the population of the sprawling valley , which lies just over the Santa Monica mountains north of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - but only 2.3% are black . <P> Today the fortress mentality within the valley is beginning to ease , but for reasons having little to do with racial broadmindedness . First , rather than have their children bused under court order to schools in west Los Angeles , up to 45 minutes away , some white residents would prefer to have more blacks within the valley . Says Mrs. Bobbi Fiedler , who won election to the school board last spring on an antibusing platform : " Most of the people I know are more concerned about losing control of where their kids attend school than about who moves in . " <P> Federal affirmative-action programs in the valley have also increased white tolerance for black newcomers . The programs obligate large companies-Rockwell , Bendix and Lockheed , among others - to hire more minorities , a difficult task given the scarcity of black residents north of the mountains . <P> To capitalize on changing white attitudes , the San Fernando Valley Fair Housing Council decided last spring to invite blacks to shop for homes in the valley . Aided by grants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the council launched a $92,000 publicity campaign , distributing glossy brochures in the wealthier Los Angeles subdivisions where black professionals tend to cluster . The brochures showed blacks playing tennis on valley courts and partying on the sundecks of $60,000 ranch homes . Black radio stations broadcast a jingle urging Los Angeles listeners to " Move on in , move on into the valley . " <P> But the campaign failed . City blacks decided that the valley was a nice place to visit but they did n't want to live there : the council received barely 100 inquiries serious enough to pass on to real estate brokers , and of these only seven black families ended up buying in the valley . Said Allison Bedell , a black house hunter who decided against the valley : " Our friends told us that the valley is not a good environment for black teen-agers . " Says Kenneth C. Kelly , a black engineer and longtime council member : " We are finding the blacks are more uptight than the white neighbors are . "        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
