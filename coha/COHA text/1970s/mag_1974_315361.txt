Beset on all sides by worsening economic news-a deep dive in labor productivity , a continued spiral in interest rates , a lag in business spending for plant and equipment-the Nixon Administration clings fast to an optimistic scenario . It insists that the slumping economy will turn up and the nation 's frightening inflation rate will go down , helped by the Federal Reserve Board 's continuing efforts to hold down growth of the money supply . Last week , Federal Reserve Chairman Arthur Burns pledged in unusually strong terms to pursue that policy-even at the price of further hurting the sliding housing industry . Now , in opposition to the Administration line , a two-pronged Democratic counter-strategy is taking shape . Democratic legislators are moving to 1 ) continue ( or revive ) limited wage-price controls to check inflation , 2 ) cut taxes in the hope of heading off a recession . <P> Under present law , wage-price controls will die this week ; and until recently congressional Democrats , under pressure from big labor , appeared willing to let them expire without a fight . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Senate Democratic Caucus for a limited extension ; to his own surprise , his motion was adopted unanimously . A bill embodying his ideas has a good chance to pass the full Senate , though its fate in the House is uncertain . The bill would permit the Cost of Living Council to reimpose controls on companies that violate commitments they had made earlier to hold down price increases and on industries that show marked inflationary tendencies . <P> The move to cut taxes is steadily picking up powerful Democratic support ; Senate Majority Leader Mike Mansfield , among others , favors the idea . The leading plan has been advanced by Senators Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts and Walter Mondale of Minnesota . They would increase personal income tax exemptions from the present $750 to $825 ; alternatively , a taxpayer could forgo using the personal exemption and simply subtract $190 from his tax bill . Estimated total reduction : $5.9 billion a year . The legislation could be introduced in the Senate as early as this week , and is expected to get quick approval ; no Senator likes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the House , the bill 's fate probably will be determined by Ways and Means Committee Chairman Wilbur Mills . Last week he seemed cautiously receptive . The President has let it be known that he would veto any tax-cut bill . <P> Big Deficit . Whatever happens to the controls and tax bills , they are setting the stage for a first-class political fight that will likely continue through the fall elections . Most Administration officials want to get rid of controls once and for all , arguing that they only breed shortages of goods by holding prices down artificially . In opposing a tax reduction , the President and his aides argue that putting more spending money in consumers ' hands and intensifying demand would only fan inflation . Moreover , the White House estimates that the federal deficit in fiscal 1975 , even without a tax cut , will hit $10 billion , about twice what it was the year before .
