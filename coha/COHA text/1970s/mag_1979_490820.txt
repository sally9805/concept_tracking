THE TALK OF THE TOWN Notes and Comment F 1 IGHTH AVENUE in the Forties is a mean part of the city , and on a bitter , windy night it is extra sad ; even the drifters are in a hurry . As we walked down the avenue one evening last week , the bright lights of the peep shows and porno movies seemed medical : a man in an overcoat came rushing through an exit like a patient in a bathrobe , angry-looking ( malpractice ? exorbitant fees ? still uncured ? ) , and almost crashed into us . We stepped to the curb . Across the street , in a mostly darkened building , some movement in lighted windows caught our eye : it was a fourth-floor rehearsal studio . The windows were steamed up because of the cold , but pale silhouettes appeared and disappeared , thin figures making arabesques : Matisse cutouts . A graceful dancer moved toward the window , hand on hip , elbow out , and perhaps she leaned against the glass , because for a moment she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away , her arm describing a lovely , decisive arc as she joined the other dancers  --  light gray  --  turning in silent convolutions , working toward some kind of beauty . ? ? Now This FROM the balcony of the Grand Ballroom of the Waldorf , the International Radio and Television Society 's Newsmaker Luncheon looked mainly a dark maroon color  --  though there were yellow tablecloths , blue and brown suits , pink skin , the occasional red of a woman 's dress  --  and made dining noises . Then waiters in blue jackets moved among the seven hundred and fifty broadcasters and guests , removing the dessert dishes , and throughout the crowd matches twinkled as cigarettes and cigars and pipes were lit , and smoke rose up and hung over the crowd , and then Anthony D. Tho mnpnulns , Robert A. Daly , and Mike Wein blatt  --  presidents of the entertainment divisions of ABC , CBS , and NBC , respectively  --  seated on a spotlit dais with as many as seventeen other executives , from television and advertising , began to answer questions that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The first question , addressed to all three of the entertainment-division presidents : " Are you going to he more responsive in the future to producers ' requests for more lead time for their shows to relieve some of the pressure that results from scheduling so close to the opening of the new television season ? " The entertainment-division presidents answered that , although they used to schedule the coming season on Washington 's Birthday , they now did n't lock the schedule until mid-or late April , and they regretted that and were looking for something to give the producers relief . Now this : " It took Beethoven about four years to write that symphony . Some things ca n't be rushed . Good music and good wine ... Of course , Paul Masson wines taste so good because they 're made with such care . TV hat Paul Masson said nearly a century ago is still true today : ' We will sell no wine  --  before its time . ' " One of the questions put to Robert A. Daly , of CBS , was " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you explain such shows as ' The Dukes of Hazzard ' and ' American Girls ' ? " He answered that he thought both shows were good shows , and he remembered that when the very successful " Beverly Hillbillies " premiered on CBS it was also considered a blemish on the Tiffany network . A question for Anthony D. Thomopoulos , of ABC , was " ' Happy Days ' lost out in the ratings last Friday for possibly the first time in its history when it ran opposite NBC 's Diff'rent Strokes . ' How do you feel about that , and are you considering moving ' Happy Days ' from its usual Tuesday-night time slot ? " He answered that he was n't worried about the show , because he thought the " Diff'rent Strokes " number it lost to was a strong number , a good number , and a legitimate number , and he had no intention of changing the " Happy Days " time slot . A question for all the entertainment-division presidents : " Why are most television shows about teen-agers and young adults @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very large proportion of your viewing audience ? " The presidents answered that they were in a business of young adult people , that they programmed into something that they thought people wanted , and that if you looked at the totality of the services offered you 'd realize that the industry was offering a viable service to the American public . Have to do this . Be right back : " Want to know something weird ? Clairol Herbal Essence gives you a clean that 's so different from ordinary cleaning shampoos  --  you 're gon na swear/ ( I swear ) / you got more hair ! The difference is , Herbal Essence has a special **25;6107;TOOLONG conditioner . So instead of just clean  --  you get a clean without all those dry flyaways . Just smooth , shiny , thick , and full . Like you got more hair ! You 're gon na swear/ ( I swear ) / you got more hair/ ( I got more hair ) / with Clairol Herbal Essence . I swear ! " " Wednesday , it 's a two-hour winter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , when the Angels put their bodies between a Presidential aide and an assassin ! Starting at eight , seven Central and Mountain . Then on Vegas ' the Dragon Lady wants Dan iced and the hit man is Dan 's old high-school buddy ! On Vegas , Wednesday , after ' Charlie 's Angels , ' on ABC . " Another question for all the entertainment-division presidents : " Do n't you think the practice of loading up the schedules for the sweep months is a form of business insanity ? " The presidents answered that they thought competition was the best thing in the world for the medium . Robert A. Daly , of CBS , said that , although the pace was slower in the old days , before the success of the mini-series and the limited series , he thought that today we might be living in the golden age of television . Lorraine Marchi MRS . LORRAINE MARCHI has the air of a person whose powers are engaged without reservation . She wears bright , simple clothes . Sitting with resolute calm amid the energetic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upholsterer in a workaday neighborhood  --  a truck neighborhood as opposed to a taxi one , a neighborhood where lofts are still used for their original purpose , where the sidewalk is cracked and patched , and the atmosphere is loud and masculine  --  she looks like a tropical bird . This is partly because of the brightness of her clothes , but it is also because of her manifestly strong personality . There is nothing deflected or ambiguous about Mrs. Marchi , Nor is there about the course of her lifework . The object of that work , however , is everything that Mrs. Marchi is not . It is ambiguous , hidden , and slyly complex : it is the condition of people who have partial vision . The difference between Mrs. Marchi 's nature and that of the problem she has grappled with is the key to her effectiveness , for her direct , undissembling ways give no quarter to the disability 's most insidious ally  --  the tendency of its victims to pretend that it does n't exist . Lorraine Marchi got into all this through her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a pigment deficiency called albinism , has only peripheral vision . When Gene was in the first grade , in San Francisco in 1951 , his parents discovered that he was considered " legally blind . " On the recommendation of an expert , the Marchis sent Gene to a school for the blind , but after a month they realized that , since he was n't blind , this made no sense and could be disastrous psychologically . The alternative was something called a sight-saving class , but the condition it was intended to deal with was so little understood  --  except by the special teachers  --  that the school board did n't even supply hooks in large type . In the course of trying to find a satisfactory solution to Gene 's problem , Mrs. Marchi discovered that , although partial vision was far from rare , people had a strong tendency to hide it . In the case of children , the impulse to avoid acknowledging the facts and dealing with them frankly was the parents ' , not the victims ' . ? Vhether nut of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were to he openly acknowledged a child would he further handicapped by the additional burden of being officially handicapped , parents of children like Gene tended to be secretive about partial vision . A father and mother might go to enormous expense to help their child privately  --  by having a single edition of a book printed in large type , for example  --  but the last thing they wanted was to hear about , think about , or care about other children with partial vision , or to identify their child with them in any way , Here Mrs. Marchi diverged sharply from the ranks of such parents . Upon realizing that this furtive instinct was one of the primary reasons that partial vision was so little understood , she first vowed never to act for Gene alone . Next , she acted . She called a meeting of San Francisco health officials , ophthalmologists , members of civic organizations , and educators , to which about fifty people came . Out of the meeting a committee was formed to print hooks in large type and distribute them . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the largest number of children , and Mrs. Marchi herself printed the hooks , on a press that a local hospital let her use . Two and a half years later  --  pregnant with her fourth child and unable to spend as much time dashing over to the hospital  --  she persuaded a local organization to buy her a press , which she installed in the basement of her home . By then , she had attracted enough volunteers  --  mostly retired people  --  to expand the operation considerably , and thus what is today the National Association for Visually Handicapped was born . As her operation grew , Mrs. Marchi discovered another large group of people who could see a little bit , but not well , and who tended to be isolated and inadequately helped , partly because help was n't available but also because of the instinct to pretend  --  in this case , their own instinct . These were people who had lost full use of their eyes later in life . Either they , too , were ashamed or they feared rejection , and almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature of their disability . For example , although the major cause of partial blindness in older people is a condition that becomes arrested at a certain point , many people whose partial blindness resulted from this condition assumed that they would eventually be totally blind . Their doctors , apparently , either did n't bother to tell them that this was not so or did n't bother to make sure that the facts were clear to their understandably traumatized patients . As a result , such people lived in a completely unnecessary state of depression and despair . Many also labored under a belief in myths that Mrs. Marchi 's organization , through education , has dispelled  --  myths such as that active use of what sight one has only weakens the eyes further . The fact is that it does no such thing , but , rather , develops one 's ability to interpret what one can see . As in the case of the children , very little help was available for these people , because their condition had been largely overlooked in the efforts to alleviate the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ son Gene , some of them were legally blind " ? a classification that made them eligible for free aid , including special training , " talking books , " and so forth . But the great majority of them did not qualify . According to Mrs. Marchi , there are today 478,800 " legally blind " people in the United States , more than seventy-five per cent of whom have partial sight . But there are , in addition , five million nine hundred thousand people with partial vision . This means that there are over six million three hundred thousand people in need of help , the majority of whom are cut off from it by the limitations of the definition of " legal blindness , " not to mention ignorance ( their own and others ' ) about their condition  --  or , at least , this was so until Mrs. Marchi came along . " It is very difficult to imagine what it is like to have partial vision , and hence very difficult to interpret the partially seeing person 's needs , " she told us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , than it is to imagine blindness . " A letter she " I assure you , when I went to the Coliseum the last thing I expected to do was buy a boat . " ? received recently brings this home . The correspondent wrote , " Two years ago ... I was seeing such distorted images that I felt as if I were observing a science-fiction movie .... The minification symptom made objects and people appear shrunken , as if I were looking out of the opposite end of binoculars . In spite of the distortion and blindness a few feet away and across the room , I can still identify objects right in front of me and function well . Now , two years later , / still see a lot of minification , but much of it has been replaced by colored shadows and silhouettes . The partial blindness is much easier to take . One of the most frustrating problems with my vision is that others ca n't know what the environment and other people look Ike to me . People ca n't understand how I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see their faces across that table .... I had to learn to realize that people were not really distorted , but it was only the way my impaired vision was seeing them . Today I am finally able to see my little girl appear headless without cringing . " Sticking to her principle of always acting in the way that would help the largest number of people , Mrs. Marchi decided almost at the start that the dissemination of information was of critical importance , and she began putting out newsletters and pamphlets , some for the families of partially sighted people , others for the victims themselves , informing them about everything from the psychological problems , through the specific facts about different visual impairments , to where special aids could be obtained . A few years ago , when rising costs forced her to cut hack the organization 's activities , she chose to drop the printing of books rather than the information projects . " We still have books in stock , and if I can raise the money I will start printing hooks again , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as an information and referral agency . There are actually all sorts of ways people can get help  --  they only need to know how . Look at this , for example . " She leaped up to fetch a huge telephone from one of her shelves . " This was developed for people whose fingers are too big to use an ordinary touch-tone telephone , but the large , clearly marked buttons are perfect for our people , too . Being able to use the telephone can make a tremendous difference . So by letting people know about the existence of the device and where to write for it we can make a tremendous difference . " The National Association for Visually Handicapped , or N.A.V.H. , now has its headquarters in New York , and is recognized as the leading agency in the field . It still has its ups and downs , however . One can tell just by its office , at 40 East Nineteenth Street  --  which has the unmistakable look of a struggling , frail , but passionate enterprise , propelled by the furious activity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a crusade , with the odds against it . Government funds have not ordinarily been available to the association , for the same reason that they are not available to many partially sighted people : the preponderance of the people whom the organization helps are not " legally blind , " and the laws governing the use of funds to help people with vision problems have required that they he spent primarily on people in that category . " Private foundations are not restricted , but many of them tend to think in the same way , " Mrs. Marchi said . " They turn me down , saying that they have already given their allotment for the blind . It is very difficult to explain to them that our people have an altogether different sort of problem . " There have been great successes , too . Largely through Mrs. Marchi 's efforts , the medical establishment has become far more aware of this group of patients . She was instrumental in getting the Times to publish an edition in large type . And she persuaded some regular book publishers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't pay they stopped . " But they gave me their surplus stock , " said Mrs. Marchi , in her firm , positive way . She has no interest whatsoever in bemoaning the difficulties that beset her . As a person totally engaged in what she knows to be vitally necessary work , she does n't have time for that . Toward the end of our visit , we asked Mrs. Marchi what had become of Gene . For the first time , she sat hack in her chair  --  really leaned hack , with an air of coming to rest . " He is a licensed vo cational nurse , " she said . " He 's happily married , with two little girls . Aside from the fact that he ca n't drive , he is a fully functioning person . " To Market THE firefighters of Engine Company 14 , on East Eighteenth Street , hate to be caught away from the firehouse without their fire engine , so they take it with them wherever they go . Twice each day , they drive it to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ groceries . The men on the day shift shop for what they hope will he lunch ; the men on the night shift shop for dinner . Cornelius O'Rourke , the captain of Engine Company 14 , calls this procedure " taking the apparatus to the A. &; P. " On a recent evening , the men who were scheduled to work the night shift at Engine Company 14 arrived at the station shortly before six o'clock for a tour of duty that would last until nine the next morning . Usually , one of the first things they do is to don their firefighting gear  --  black helmets , black rubber boots , and black rubber coats  --  and take the apparatus to the A. &; P. Unpredictable events sometimes interrupt this routine  --  fires , for instance . If a radio alarm arrives while they are shopping at the A. &; P. , they stash their grocery cart in a corner , run from the store , board the apparatus , which has been double-parked outside the store , go fight the fire , and then return to finish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 9 has n't been a fire emergency at the store itself in memory , but the assistant manager , Joseph Babe , told us the other day that if there ever is one he hopes it erupts about an liar before lunch or dinner . On this particular evening , the fire engine was n't immediately available , because the men from the previous shift had driven it down to Fourth Street near Avenue B , where a tenement was burning . This meant that the trip to the A. &; P. would he delayed . A red-and-white hand-lettered sign hangs above the doorway of a room in the firehouse which functions as an eat-in kitchen . It says , " Dinner Served Till 8 P.M. " This is a firemen 's joke . The men who were arriving for work were Captain O'Rourke , the commanding officer and a by-the-hook sort of guy ; Nick Imperato , who drives the fire engine and , when he is on the night shift , usually cooks dinner ; Joe Brocker ; Mike Foy ; and John Vigliotti . Except for O'Rourke , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men call each other by their first names . Even if Vigliotti were not named John , the men would call him Johnny , because in the argot of firefighting the least senior member of a crew is called the " johnny . " " I 've only got five years on the job , " Vigliotti told us as we waited with him in the kitchen for the return of the apparatus . " It means I clean the tools on the apparatus , I polish the brass . And after a meal I scrub the pots and pans . I used to go to the supermarket , too  --  all alone . Since the fiscal crisis and the cutbacks , we 're working with a four-man crew plus an officer . It used to be a five-man crew , which left the johnny free to go shop for a meal . I 'd walk over to Third Avenue . There 's a good Sloan 's there . And there 's a store at Fourteenth Street and First Avenue where there 's a checleout lady named Martha who works on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no matter how much you 're buying , she always waves you over . Some very nice women shop at that Sixth Avenue A. &; P. One night , I met a girl there and invited her over to have chicken with us at the station . She said , ' No , thanks . I 'm a vegetarian . ' " A hell sounded eleven times in the firehouse garage . We asked whether that was a call to go fight a fire . " No , " said Brocker . " That 's just our system for checking the alarm . Right on time  --  six-thirty . " He glanced at Captain O'Rourke , who was seated at a table . " Whoops ! Excuse me  --  eightTHE NEW YORKER een hundred and thirty hours . " At nineteen hundred and forty-five hours , after the previous station crew had returned from the lower East Side , Captain O'Rourke asked , " What 're we eating ? " " Sausage and potatoes , " said Imperato . We boarded the fire engine , sliding into the cab next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today , on Forty-second Street near Ninth Avenue , " he said . " There 's a good pork store there , so I brought in some sausages . Sometimes , if I get here early , I 'll roast chickens with a sausage stuffing . Or , if I 'm really early , I 'll make lasagna . Do I cook at home ? Every now and then . My kids enjoy it when I do . Because I take chances . If I make chicken cacciatore , I add a little more wine , or spices . My wife 's conservative with the spices . " As Imperato pulled out of the garage onto Eighteenth Street , Captain O'Rourke called the Manhattan dispatcher , whose quarters are in Central Park , and announced a " ten-eight , " which means " in service and available for a run . " The fire engine drove down University Place and across Eleventh Street and up Sixth Avenue . Often , when the men from Engine Company 14 arrive at the A. &; P. , they find that their fire engine is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Engine Companies 18 , 3 , and 24 and Ladder Companies 3 , 9 , and 12 also regularly take their apparatuses to the Sixth Avenue A. &; P. O'Rourke volunteered to stay with the engine ; Mike Foy went into Famous Ray 's Pizza , on the corner of Eleventh Street , to get himself an appetizer ; and Brucker , Vigliotti , and Imperato entered the supermarket and fanned out . Occasionally , other shoppers notice the firemen and ask whether they plan to pay for the food . This question , along with arson and false alarms , really gets on the men 's nerves . No such question was asked on this evening , however . Imperato picked up some potatoes and onions and canned tomatoes , Vigliotti selected bread and butter , and Brocker got frozen hroccoli and grapefruit juice . When they had paid for everything , they asked for some fresh entry blanks and lucky numbers for a game called " A. &; P. $1,000 Cash Bonanza . " If the firemen ever win anything , the proceeds will he put in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the firehouse and is labelled " Arthur 's Soup Fund . " Arthur Schilling is a member of Engine Company 14 who makes excellent soup  --  lentil-prosciutto is his specialty  --  and who , with proper financing , will cook a pot that will feed three consecutive shifts . Now the men rehoarded their apparatus and rode back to the fire station . When they arrived , Captain O'Rourke signalled the dispatcher with a " ten-nine , " which means " hack in quarters , " and Imperato went to work preparing dinner . He sliced the potatoes and onions , put them in two greased baking dishes , spiced them , added whole sweet sausages , put the dishes in the oven , blocked the oven door , which has no springs , with a chair , and announced , in civilianese , that dinner would be ready at nine-thirty . At nine-twenty , an alarm sounded and a radio dispatcher reported a restaurant fire at Twenty-third and Lexington . Imperato removed the food and turned off the oven , and everyone quickly hoarded the fire engine and drove , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other fire companies arrived simultaneously , and where there were a couple of restaurants but no fire . Imperato radioed the Manhattan dispatcher for more information and was told to go to a Chinese restaurant at 161 East Twenty-third . At that address , there was a delicatessen called Bo Bo Foods but still no visible fire . " I do n't know whether it 's a Chinese restaurant , " Imperato said to O'Rourke , " but there 's Chinese people in there . " O'Rourke and the rest of the men  --  all except Imperato  --  left the apparatus in quest of a conflagration . The fire turned out to be a defective oil burner that was smoking but not burning . Five minutes later , everyone was aboard and headed back to Eighteenth Street . " How 's that meal coming ? " O'Rourke asked . " We 're getting there , Captain , " said Imperato as he steered around a corner . " We 're getting there . "                  @ @ @
