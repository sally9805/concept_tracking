In a rambling talk to 25 foreign journalists visiting his office last March , Alabama Governor George Wallace expressed some of his views on international affairs . Said he : " I think we were fighting the wrong people , maybe , in World War II , and I say that with all due regard to the Soviet , ah , person here . " <P> From Wallace , a World War II Army Air Forces flight engineer who had ten missions over Japan , that was quite a bombshell . He felt that if the U.S. had done more to cultivate the friendship of Germany and Japan after World War I instead of being antagonistic , " there would n't have been any Hitler . " The Japanese , he declared , were " provoked to a certain extent by people , by interests in this country that helped to bring about Pearl Harbor . " Without the war against the Axis powers , there would be today a " good buffer in the East against the Soviet and Chinese expansion plans . " <P> Last week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meeting , published some quotes , and Wallace rushed to amend the record , by coincidence on the 30th anniversary of V-E day . In World War II , he said , the U.S. was " fighting the right people , but our diplomacy led us to fight people who should have been our friends . " That revision made Wallace 's original statement sound more reasonable , but his remarks will add to the worry in the liberal and moderate wings of the Democratic Party , which are already alarmed by his steady rise in the presidential polls .
