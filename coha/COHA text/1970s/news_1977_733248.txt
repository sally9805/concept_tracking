txt The most far-ranging reconnaissance of the outer solar system thus far is set to begin with the planned launching Saturday of the first of two Voyager spacecraft , . unmanned vehicles outfitted with camera and scientific sensors to examine the planets Jupiter , Saturn and possibly Uranus . The two Voyagers , identical 1,820-pound craft , are expected to transmit pictures and data from as many as 15 worlds ? mighty Jupiter and five of its moons , the ringed Saturn ' nd seven of its moons , and the distant Uranus . Afterward , nearly a decade from now , the spacecraft should streak out into interstellar space . Lift-off of the first Voyager is scheduled for 10:25 A.M. Saturday at the Kennedy Space Center here . The second spacecraft is to be launched Sept. 1 . In an interview today , Dr. Bruce C. Murray , director of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory , said : " We are going to explore more objects , greater mass , more diversity and a larger portion of the solar system than has ever been explored before . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This enormously rich exploration should be the stimulus for planetary . science for many decades to come . " The Jet Propulsion Laboratory , operated for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration by the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena , Calif. , built the spacecraft and is directing the mission . Cost of the project is expected to exceed $400 million . In many ways the Voyager project is a scaled-down version of the planetary " grand tour " that was killed for budgetary re-sons : n .1971 . The plan was to disprtch two spacecraft to fly by all the cuter p : nets  --  Jupiter , Saturn , Uranus , Neptune and Pluto . This would have been possible , because , starting now , the outer planets are moving into an alignment that recurs or : ' y once . ery 180 years . Gravity-Assist Technique Such an alignment afforded the opportunity to visit all the planets over a period of 12 to 15 years , about half the time it would otherwise have taken , and to do it with present-day rocket power . The spacecraft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they passed . If carefully targeted , they would be pulled in by a planet 's gravity and then whipped out at a higher velocity , pointed in the direction of the next planet out . The Voyagers will employ the same gravity-assist technique to pick up speed and change course at Jupiter for the trip out to Saturn . The technique was proved // feasible when Mariner 10 , in 1974 , used the gravitational field of Venus to get to Mercury . Although the Voyager project was initiated to replace the canceled " grand tour " and has an option to visit Uranus and perhaps even Neptune , Dr. Murray emphasized that the mission 's primary objectives were Jupiter and Saturn , the two largest planets in the solar system . The spacecraft have a designed four-year lifetime . long enough to make it to Saturn . " In no way are we promising or obligated to reach Uranus , " Dr. Murray said . Heightened Uranus Interest Nonetheless , if all goes well , flight controllers are prepared to send one of the Voyagers pest Saturn in such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Uranus . the third largest planet , was heightened by the discovery in March of five faint rings circling it , much like the rings of Saturn . The plan is for Voyager 2. now on its launch pad . to be launched first , this Saturday . Though Voyager I will be launched second , it is to fly a faster traiectory and reach Jupiter in March 1979. four months ahead of Voyager 2 , and pass Saturn in November 1980 , nine months ahead of Voyager 2 . If Voyager I meets all its scientific objectives , Voyager 2 is to be shifted to make a more distant fly-by of Saturn and aim for Uranus . It could reach Uranus in January , 1986 . And if it continues to he in good operating condition , the spacecraft might be able to transmit the first close-up views of Neptune in September , 1939 . Earlier Charting Done Two . American spacecraft , Pioneers 10 end 11 , have already explored the environs of Jupiter . charting its strong magnetic fields and returning images of its mysterious , giant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telescopic cameras , one of which should return pictures with 40 times the resolution of those taken by the Pioneers . No spacecraft have yet explored the planets beyond Jupiter , thoueh Pioneer 11 is now on a trajectory that should take it through Saturn 's rings in 1979 . However , the quality of its imaging is expected to be poor , and the scientific data limited . The Voyager spacecraft are advanced versions of the Mariner planetary explorers that studied Mercury , Venus and Mars . They differ from their predecessors in many respects , primarily because of the environment into which they must venture and the great distances across which they must communicate with the Earth . For example , since the amount of sunlight reaching the outer planets is anly a small fraction of that reaching the Earth , the Voyagers can not depend on solar energy , as did the Mariners , but must use nuclear power . Uranns is 20 times farther from the sun than is Earth ; Saturn , 10 times , and Jupiter , more than five times . Another new feature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ largest communications antenna yet flown on planetary missions . Even so , communicating with the Voyagers will not be as easy as on previous flights . Because of the distances , it will take 45 minutes for , radio signals to travel from Earth to JuplA ter , an hour and a half to Saturn . For this reason , engineers designed the : spacecraft to be more automatic and dependent of earth-based control than the . Mariners . Their on-board computers weie built and programmed to take care of themselves and perform complex scientifw is work without continuous commanding ' from the ground . Each spacecraft has 10 scientific instruments , most of which are attached to an extensible boom . These include wideangle and narrow-angle ' television cameras , cosmic ray detectors , infrared spectrometers and radiometers , low-energy charged particle detectors , magnetometers , photopolarimeters , ultraviolet spectrometers and plasma sensors . With these instruments scientists hope to learn more about the atmospheric density and composition of the gaseous planets Jupiter and Saturn and some of their satellites , to observe their magnetic fields and radiation emissions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the rocky satellites and to study the particles of interplanetary space . According to mission plans , Voyager 1 is to fly within 174,000 miles of Jupiter and 80,000 miles of Ganymede , the largest of 13 Jovian satellites . It will then be aimed to come within 80,000 miles of Saturn 's southern hemisphere , safely outside the rings , and only 2,550 miles of Titan , the largest Saturnian moon . Voyager 2 is supposed to swing by Jupiter at a distance of 397,000 miles . Neither spacecraft wants to get too close to Jupiter because of the risk of damage from the planet 's intense radiation belts . But Voyager 2 is expected to get an even closer view of Ganymede ( 34,000 miles away ) before streaking out to an ' encounter with Saturn at a distance of 62,000 miles . One of the most fascinating targets of Voyager exploration is expected to be the Saturn moon of Titan . Much larger than the Earth 's moon , Titan has been observed through telescopes to have an atmosphere similar in density to that of Earth but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter , which could provide clues to the evolution of primitive life . " Titan should he far more interesting to us than Mars , " Dr. Murray said .
