txt President Nixon , in another regional conference designed to arouse support for his domestic programs , today called his proposal for revenue sharing " the only hope " for reducing local property taxes . He said that such taxes might in time be reduced as much as 30 per cent if Congress approved his plan to return some $5-billion in Federal revenue to state and local governments for " general " purposes this year , and more in years to come . Mr. Nixon 's suggestion that homeowners would receive a net tax break from his plan was not without considerable political appeal and represented a new wrinkle in his campaign to overcome the opposition of key Congressmen . Administration spokesmen had conceded that communities could use general revenue-sharing funds to reduce property tax burdens , but until now they had voiced the hope that localities would maintain their present tax efforts and use the new revenues to finance badly needed services . Today the President described property taxes as the most " unfair , " " unpopular " and fastest-rising of all taxes . He said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pay a higher portion of their income for housing than do people in the middle- and upper-income brackets . Mr. Nixon expressed confidence that , because of what he described as a " taxpayers ' revolt , " his revenue-sharing proposal " in some form " would be approved by Congress this year . He also predicted that his welfare reform proposal would be approved before the present Congress adjourns at the end of next year , as well as parts of another major element of his domestic program , the reorganization of the Federal Government . Mr. Nixon made his comments in an informal 40-minute summation of his hopes and aspirations , both at home and abroad , to 74 news executives from 13 Eastern and Northeastern states . The meeting , which included presentations by various White House aides and Cabinet members , was similar in format to gatherings of news executives earlier this year in Des Moines and Birmingham . After the meeting , Mr. Nixon spoke once more to a session of the New York State Citizens Committee for Revenue Sharing . One co-chairmen of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sharing and described Mr. Nixon as " the first President to reverse the flow from Washington back to the states  --  and in that he is going to start this nation back to the fundamentals that made it great . " Mr. Nixon did not refer directly in either meeting to the controversy over The New York Times 's publication of documents drawn from a Pentagon study of decisions that led to growing American involvement in the Indochina war . The documents have been seized upon by critics of the war as providing fresh ammunition for their appeal for faster American withdrawals , by the White House press secretary , Ronald L. Ziegler , told newsmen on the way from Washington to Rochester that Mr. Nixon would have no comment on the controversy . Near the end of his remarks to the news executives , how- , ever , Mr. Nixon went to some ! length to defend at least the spirit , if not the specific consequences , of the use of American power in international disputes . He insisted that the United , States had always used its I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " it ; he called for an end to " national defeatism " and for the restoration of national " spirit " , and he insisted that , despite current criticism and divisions in the nation , the United States would continue to play an important world role " in the next 25 years . " " The nation , " he said , " needs at times to be reassured . " Later , addressing Mr. Rockefeller 's group , he added , " Do n't let the young people lose confidence . ' However , his message apparently did not reach as tar as the steps of the city 's first National Bank , across the street , where young members of the Progressive Labor party gathered to brandish antiwar signs and chant , " One , two , three , four , we do n't like your fascist war . " Mr. Nixon saw other antiwar signs as his motorcade wound its way through downtown Rochester to the Flagship Hotel , but in general the crowds in this Republican-dominated city seemed large and friendly .    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
