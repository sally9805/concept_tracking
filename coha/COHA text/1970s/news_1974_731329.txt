txt INTERNAL Revenue Service agents in Springfield are conducting an investigation of 2 , - 000 persons hired as contract employes by the state but never put on state payrolls . The investigation , one of the biggest ever made by the IRS into Illinois state government , is aimed at former and present state contract workers who may have evaded payment of income taxes on their salaries . The investigation was confirmed yesterday by a spokesman for State Con tr oler George Lindberg and Auditor General David Thom a s . It began two months ago when IRS agents gave Lindberg the 2,000-name list , which included persons who received state funds as far back as 1969 . The agents asked for duplicate contracts detailing the work performed . AionE THAN 1,600 persons receive monthly checks from the state from what are known as Contractual Service Accounts . No state or federal income taxes or Social Security payments are deducted from the check , and it is up to the individual to make these payments . IRS agents reportedly made a spot check of income tax returns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either set the income below what they received or failed to declare it . This was particularly evident in the cases of lawyers , accountants , and other professional persons who supply a service to the st a t e . The contracts for these services can be let ' without competitive bidding . IT HAS NOT been uncommon in the past to give lucrative professional services contracts to persons with political connections . Often , the person hired is only required to work a small part of his time for the state . The IRS also is seeking to determine if the contract employes should actually have been put on state payrolls , which would make them subject to normal tax deductions . Thomas said the practice of putting a person on contract is also a means of evading the state personnel code . A spokesman for Lindberg said the practice was " also a gimmick for office holders to make it appear that they are cutting their payrolls , when actually they are just shifting employes to the contract jobs , " L IND B G 'S spokesman said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in almost all state agencies . The agencies most prominent , however , were the secretary of state 's office , the Department of General Services , the Department of Trans. porLation , the attorney general 's office , and the Department of Corrections . Thomas said audits of the Department of Corrections in 1971 and 1972 showed scores of persons listed as under contract to the state . One person , a consultant , received $1,000 a month from January , 1970 , to June , 1972 , and $600 a month thereafter . " Altho the need for proles ? sonal services for a relatively short time is apparent in any state government , we often find persons receiving this money for two and three years , and sometimes longer , " Thomas said . THE IRS INVESTIGATION has also touched off a study by the state controller , the director of the Bureau of the Budget , and the attorney general 's office to determine what is the difference between a contract employe and one whose name appears on a payroll . The current thinking on the subject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the state for his services , he is a state employe . However , if he has other employment or clients , such as doctors and lawyers , he would be considered a bona fide contract employe
