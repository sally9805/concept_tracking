txt Crime The Now York Tlmas/Neal Boom ! One of 24 policemen accused last week of collecting payoffs from gamblers in Brooklyn hides behind newspaper in police van . The annual take , it was said , came to a quarter of a million dollars . Corrupt Police : The Next Board Meeting May Be In Jail They met at least once a month . Sometimes the chairman prepared art agenda . They discussed business matters such as insurance , severance pay , the organization 's price structure and the possibility of enlarging the staff . A gathering of senior executives in the shiny glass corporate headquarters of IBM or General Motors ? Not so . This was a meeting , according to District Attorney Eugene Gold last week , of plainclothes policemen in northern Brooklyn as they pursued the collection of their monthly payoffs from gamblers : $10,000 a year per man tax free  --  a quarter of a million dollars for the whole group . It was neat profit for any business concern , especially one which operated with an annual $300,000 subsidy from the government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But this year the annual report will have bad news for the stockholders : 24 members of the firm have been indicted for bribery and suspended from the Police Department , one commanding officer has committed suicide and another 15 to 20 former members face departmental charges that could result in their dismissal from the department . The discussions about insurance , Mr. Gold said at a news conference , involved a system whereby an individual patrolman would continue to receive his share of the " pad " ? the payoffs  --  for a couple months if he was caught by investigators , the idea being that it would help him pay his legal expenses . Severance pay , the prosecutor said , was given each patrolman for two or three months upon leaving the 13th Public Morals Administrative Division for assignment in a new unit . This money made up for the first months of a policeman 's assignment to the division when payment from the " pad " was withheld pending discrete checks about his reliability . Last summer 's hearings on police corruption by the Knapp Commission , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is on " and , because of the increased peril to those on the take , mandated an increase in the bribes paid by the gamblers . Mr. Gold said the discussion about enlarging the staff turned on the question of whether the plainclothesmen should hire a civilian to make the monthly pickups from the gamblers . This finally was rejected because the policemen involved did not want to lose the $200 monthly bonus or " hat " for the dangerous job of making the pickups themselves . Outlandish ? No . This business-like method of collecting graft , in this case in the slums of Bedford StuyVesant and the Fort Greene section of Brooklyn , is far from new . Detective Frank Serpico told Mayoral assistant Jay Kriegel about almost precisely the same collection system in the southern Bronx . William R. Phillips , a patrolman forced into becoming an undercover agent for the Knapp Commission , described it in Harlem and said payoffs were being made in every division in the city . In the early 1950 's , a bookmaker named Harry Gross started talking and three policemen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The only essentially new aspect about the latest Brooklyn payoff ring is how it came to be exposed . For as long as there have been ' police , some of their best cases have been made with evidence collected by criminals who agreed to help the law enforcers in return for leniency on their own cases . Now , for the first time in the history of New York , law enforcement officials reported this ' ' turn around " technique had been adopted by the Police Department to nail police criminals . Two policemen now under 24-hour guard were caught taking bribes and were then persuaded to act as undercover agents for about a year . Will this new technique end the decades-old system of payoffs by gamblers to the police ? It is doubtful . But with the use of this new technique in conjunction with many administrative changes , such as increasing the number of supervisors and strictly applying a rule holdings bosses accountable for the actions of their men , there is some cause for optimism . Senior police officials , however , feel the cynical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a decade before it will be known whether the dark persistent current has been reversed . And they note that with the probable departure of Mayor Lindsay in December , 1973 , the chief architect of the reforms , Commissioner Patrick V. Murphy , also may depart .
