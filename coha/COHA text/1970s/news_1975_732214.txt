txt Letters to the Editor pg . 36 Letters to the Editor Of the Anti-Zionism Resolution and the Future of the U.N . To the Editor : In the first flush of outrage after the affirmative vote in the U.N . last night on the anti-Zionism resolution , one got the feeling that immediate reprisals against the U.N . are in order . True , this outrage against an " act of infamy " as voiced by the U.S. Ambassador to the U.N . was well taken , and those member countries who voted in favor of the resolution should be taken to task so the world should know how low the United Nations has sunk in its deliberations and actions . As already proclaimed by some members of the U.N . and the news media , the U.N . may have signed its death warrant by this action . That would be a pity for a world that is struggling so desperately for peace . Therefore , for the United States to withdraw now its support to the U.N . would deal the death blow to an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there fighting even harder than ever as our able Ambassador , Mr. Moynihan , has done and mincing no words in so doing . It is just as necessary to keep those nations already with us , fighting alongside of us , and to make every effort to bring around as many of the other nations as possible . To abdicate this position now will only deliver into the hands of those who think they have won the first round the entire battle for freedom for all . JOAN H. WEISI . New York , Nov. 11 , 1975 ? To the Editor : Is it not an anachronism that at a time when even Catholics begin to doubt the dogma of the infallibility of the Pope , the Zionists are imposing the dogma of the infallibility of Zionism and the state of Israel on the American people ? The anti-Zionist resolution of the U.N . should have been checked as to its facts , merits and veracity . Is Israel an apartheid state , racist by definition , because she has displaced an Arab majority , does not allow it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does not even recognize that Palestinians exist ? If so , the Zionists and Israel should be told to allow the Palestinians to return or to have their own state , possibly in confederation with Israel , or to make peace with the Palestinians in some other way . Instead of going into the merits of the U.N . resolution , your paper abounds with violent denunciations of it . The attempt by Abba Eban to rebut the charge of a Zionist apartheid state with the fact that the Arab minority in Israel has some representation in the Knesset is spurious . What counts Mr. Ford 's Mistakes To the Editor : I would n't mind having Gerry Ford as a friend . He 's a nice guy . But I am beginning to mind very much having Gerald R. Ford as my President . He makes too many mistakes . Because he is human , I can excuse some of his mistakes , like his unpardonable pardon , mishandling the Mayaguez incident , ill-treatment of Solzhenitsyn and cuddling up to Sadat . No one is perfect . But I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his promise to participate in all primaries instead of attending to his job . Exerting all the effort that such campaigning requires instead of concentrating on the nation 's welfare raises doubts about his dedication . The other is his absolutely unforgivable use of the veto . Mr. Ford does not really represent the will and voice of the people . He ought to realize that the unprecedented series of events which projected him into the Presidency makes him a mere custodian of the office pending an election . He does not have the moral right to make the most weighty decisions without the advice and even the instruction of Congress , the elected voice of the people . How can an individual elected by a single Congressional district ( not even a statewide electorate ) have the temerity to veto a majority decision of a Congress elected by fifty states ? How can he decide to let New York go down the drain without consulting Congress ? How can he inflict this injustice on the city , the state and the eight million Americans who happen to live in New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ structure of the country ? Would England let London go down the drain , France abandon Paris or Germany forsake Berlin ? But perhaps I am making an unforgivable mistake . Perhaps Mr. Ford will really become a big man and in these last moments see the light , admit his mistakes and come to the costless rescue of a once-proud city . I hope he may prove to he the kind of man I would like to have as my President . ROBERT GOLDFARB Rye , N. Y. , Nov. 12 , 1975 Pat Warner is that the displaced Palestinian majority has none . Is it too much to ask you to reconsider your policy on the U.N . resolution ? FREDERICK WALLACH Bayside , N.Y. , Nov. 10 , 1975 ? To the Editor : Your Nov. 11 editorial on the U.N . vote equating Zionism with racism misses the point . The U.N. , like its predecessor , the League of Nations , has become an organization which is counterproductive and , therefore , dangerous to world peace . The West was slumbering in the thirties in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Italy , the eventual perpetrators of World War Ii . The League of Nations was thought to be an instrumentality to guard against impending war . That war did not break out because Hitler invaded Danzig and Japan attacked Pearl Harbor . That war became inevitable when the West acquiesced in the conquest of Manchuria by Japan , the conquest of Ethiopia by Italy and the conquest of Austria , Czechoslovakia , etc. by Hitler Germany . May I submit to you that Pan-Slavism masquerading under the Communist ideology will not be assuaged by sacrificing little Israel , just as PanGermanism was not assuaged by Austria , then the Sudetenland , then all of Czechoslovakia . Are we condemned to suffer the holocaust of nuclear war because our leaders and our media refuse to heed the lessons of history ? Let 's call a spade a spade . The U.N . has become an instrumentality of Communist conquest . It has long since outlived its To the Editor : The Times of Nov. 10 reports that the Senate select committee investigating the C.I.A . has not been able to schedule @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facts . On Oct. 2 , pursuant to my requests via the committee staff , the chairman , Senator Church , invited me to testify . ( I was U. S. Ambassador to Chile from 1967 to 1971. ) 1 accepted by immediate return letter . On Oct. 20 , the committee informed me by letter that I should present myself for a public hearing at 10 A.M. , Nov. 4 ; it suggested in two and a half single-spaced pages the topics which I might discuss in an opening 15-minute statement . On Oct. 28 , by registered letter , I sent to Senator Church a lengthy statement for the public record ; I explained that my oral opening statement ( already drafted ) would be based on this written submission , which I requested be promptly distributed to the committee for careful , unpublicized consideration by the Senators prior to my appearance . On Oct. 30 , I verified , by telephone , receipt of my letter ; I asked the committee why only one public day on Chile in toto and only two witnesses , myself and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Church . On Oct. 31 , the committee telephoned to say there would be no public hearing City Without Justice To the Editor : Why does n't New York City disband the Police Department ? Just think of the money we 'd save : salaries of police who are wasting their time bringing in criminals ; salaries of judges who feel the guilty should he protected from the ' ' brutes " employed to enforce the law ; salaries of prosecuting attorneys ; salaries of court and jail employees , etc. , etc . We could even abolish the traffic departmenj. and let the motorists who are running red lights at every intersection fight it out among themselves . The President seems to feel every usefulness and should be abandoned by the U. S. forthwith . As it is , we are contributing a substantial share to a propaganda machine which is solely oriented toward the destruction of a way of life we hold dear . F. S. BLASER Kew Garden Hills , N.Y. , Nov. 11 , 1975 ? To the Editor : The resolution passed by the General Assembly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been treated with the contempt and disdain which it deserves . It is in this connection that one ought to point out that one of the active sponsors of the resolution was Egypt , which is a party to the recently concluded Sinai Agreement . One of the commitments given by Egypt was to tone down its antiIsrael campaign and to create a peaceful atmosphere to advance further progress toward Mideast peace . Egypt has now violated this commitment , and one is entitled to wonder if she can be trusted not to violate the parts of the Sinai Agreement . Those who are skeptical about Egypt 's sincerity will now have their views reinforced and are entitled to be pessimistic about the fate of this accord . RABBI FABIAN SCHONFELD Pres. , Rabbinical Council of America New York , Nov. 11 , 1975 ? To the Editor : I would suggest that New York City no longer has the obligation to house the United Nations . At a time when the crucial services and needs of the people of the city are being cut or completely eliminated , we can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without meaning . We can not afford it economically or morally . With all its faults and failures , the city at least makes the effort to eliminate racism . The United Nations , which is now a symbol ' of hate and discrimination , is a dangerous example of the victory of ignorance . With our tradition of hospitality to intellectual freedom , New York City was the natural and proper home for the United Nations . When the U.N . emerges as a place of greed and hate and potential terror , then , I say , let it go ? New York City ca n't afford it , the United States ca n't afford it , the Western world ca n't afford it . Let it go , let it find its own level of intelligence in a country more suitable to its beliefs . I would suggest Uganda . ANNE ZUCKER Brooklyn , Nov. 11 , 1975 Nov. 4 ; any public hearing was now In question , I was told . I protested . On Nov. 3 , a high State Department official called on behalf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ determined opposition to public hearings on this topic . That same day , William Colby wrote to reinforce this view and " to convey to you my judgment that the subject matter remains classified . " I told the State Department caller that I had insisted the committee hold public hearings and I would continue to . On Nov. 4 , I wrote the committee to reiterate this position and to ask why my predecessor for almost three years ( 1965-67 ) and my successor for two years ( 1971-73 ) had been called to testify in secret executive session while I , the witness to the specific 1970-71 events under Investigation , could not testify to the committee , either in public or in private , before Senator Church handed to the Senate the committee 's report on assassination . ( A junior committee staff representative had questioned me informally at my home last summer . ) Instead of timely and mature consideration of the facts and the issues , the public is again being manipulated . It should ask Senator Church why he , no less than the Administration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ KORRY Briarcliff Manor , N. Y. , Nov. 10 , 1975 New Yorker is responsible for the city 's financial position , so we all should be punished . Judges sanction the criminal to go thou and sin some more while threatening a police officer with contempt of court for shaking his head in consternation at the token punishment meted out . Is n't anybody on the side of the taxpaving , law-abiding citizen ? LEE F. UHLMANN New York , Nov. 11 , 1975 ? A Seat for the Elderly To the Editor : Please allow me , very much a senior citizen , to reply to the recent letter of Kate P. Durrell about the sign on the front seats of the city buses ? " Wo n't you please give this seat to the elderly or handicapped . " The " young people " ? healthy or not  --  who occupy these seats are perfectly able to read , not unable , as Miss Durrell suggests . The fault is not with them but with the placing of the request on the back of the seat , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its message , is meant to he seen , it should be placed higher up in large , hold type , on the windows , well above the scats . And Miss Durrell is very naive If she really believes that the Transit Authority cares about the welfare of those who ride its buses ? be they young or old , sick or healthy . HERBERT S. ROBINSON New York , Nov. 5 , 1975 Chile and the C.I.A. : Foiled Testimony
