txt Egypt has changed the character of its alliance with Russia , but not broken that alliance or reduced Russia 's military presence in the eastern Mediterranean . This is the preliminary assessment by intelligence and diplomatic communities here of the news from Cairo . The changes are welcome . They are regarded as definitely improving the conditions for real negotiations between Egypt and Israel . They expose and confirm an existing assumption in these communities here that Moscow is solidly against any effort by Egypt to regain its lost territories by force of arms . But , there is no reason yet known here to think that there will be fewer Russian warships in the Mediterranean or fewer Russian warplanes flying around the Middle East , or any less Russian influence on the sources of Mideast oil . Power use limited Another way of stating all this is that Russia continues to be a power in the Middle East but has itself limited the use of that power in a manner which just could be constructive . It is not allowing the Egyptians to use the Russian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Peninsula . If the Egyptians want any part of their lost territories back they are going to have to try for it through direct negotiations with Israel . Egypt has retaliated by telling the Russians to take a lot of their people out of Egypt . But this is not a total expulsion of all Russians as happened when the Chinese broke with Russia . It is an expulsion of those Russians who have been serving with Egyptian ground troops and rubbing shoulders on the streets of Cairo with Egyptian citizens . And it involves a reclaiming of Egyptian sovereignty over naval and air bases . The commanding officers at all bases are apparently to be Egyptians now , not Russians . It is about half of what France did to American military forces there . The French expelled all , but remained in the alliance . The Egyptians are expelling those who irritated Egyptians . But Russia continues to enjoy naval and air bases . ' Alliance ' continues In other words the new situation , as read here , is that Egypt ceases to be a satellite of Russia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Egypt will ( presumably ) get . regular flow of military supplies sufficient to maintain its present defensive posture against Israel . It could n't get these from any other source . And in return Russia can continue to base its military presence in the eastern Mediterranean in Egypt . Intelligence sources here say that this new condition has been building up from well - before President Nixon 's visit to Moscow . Incidents of friction between Russians and Egyptians have been reported frequently for over a year . Russia 's refusal to underwrite and supply an Egyptian offensive into the Sinai dates from that far back also . // *Russia 's new policy on Egypt welcomed by U.S. as ' helpful ' // Washington , naturally , would have preferred a total expulsion of all Russians from Egypt . But to expect that would have been unrealistic . Russia does have an established presence . It is one of the facts of modern life in the Middle East . The practical question is not how to get rid of it , but the role it will play . At the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of avoiding any confrontation with the United States . Also , present Russian policy seems to aim at avoiding alarms among the West Europeans . The implication to Israel , as read here , is that Russia has backed away from sponsoring any Egyptian military offensive against Israel . Egypt has plenty of defensive arms . ttut Moscow has called off its own " cold war " against Israel , Zionists , and Jews in general . All of which seems to mean that if President Sadat is ever to get back any of his lost territories he will have to deal directly with Israel .
