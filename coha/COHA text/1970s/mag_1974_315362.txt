For years , when the weather turned mild and trees sprouted buds , corporate recruiters would flock to the nation 's campuses , intent on signing up the best and the brightest of the graduating seniors . But in the past several years the interviewing often has been a polite and fruitless exercise on both sides : many students were not anxious to join companies-especially those making munitions or polluting the environment-and businesses were not eager to hire large numbers of new graduates amid alternating threats of recession and inflation . This spring the atmosphere has once again changed : the recruiters are back in record numbers , they mean business , and they are getting a warm reception . <P> As of the end of February , reports the nonprofit College Placement Council , job offers to seniors were up 26% over those made to the class of ' 73 . And by last week , when the recruiting season ended at many colleges , more companies had visited more campuses and conducted more interviews than at any time in the past four years . The business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worst of all combinations , an inflationary recession . But many companies are still flush with the profits of boom-year 1973 ; they are going ahead with expansion plans and looking for new employees . <P> For students the stigma of working for industry has largely gone . " People realize that business is starting to clean up , to become conscious of its responsibilities , " says Senior Ron Wolff of Carleton College in Northfield , Minn . Students once again seem more interested in careers than causes . " When I started college , I wanted to help peopie , " says Diane Gordon , a senior at Syracuse University . " Now I want to help myself . " <P> Most likely to help themselves are seniors with engineering degrees ; they are receiving 59% of all job offers . Average starting salaries now range from about $11,500 for a civil engineer to $12,900 for a petroleum engineer-the best since the heyday of the space age . The demand is a legacy of the energy crisis , says Mike Donohue , placement director at the Georgia Institute of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a shortage of oil or oil derivatives that they have to make more efficient use of materials . The problems are technical problems , and it will take engineers to solve them . " <P> There are not that many engineers to hire-enrollment in engineering schools has dropped 20% in the past three years-and companies are competing for the best as fervently as the colleges recruit top athletes . Gary Budd , a senior in industrial engineering at Georgia Tech , was invited to visit seven different companies ' plants . He traveled with his wife , wined , dined and lodged lavishly-all at the companies ' expense . Says Michigan State University Senior Keith Miller : " Even if you have only a 2-point average in chemical engineering the equivalent of a C , you are supposed to be able to get a job .
