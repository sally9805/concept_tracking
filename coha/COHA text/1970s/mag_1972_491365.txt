When I was about ten or eleven , growing up in a back-East big town , Uncle George invited me out to the farm for a couple of summer weeks . Guess he figured it was about time I started earning a living and pulling my own weight ( which at that time was a solid eighty-seven pounds of piano wire and gristle ) . He said he 'd pay me fifty cents a week plus keep , figuring I might make a good hand some day . I jumped at the chance . Old Aunt Mamie always did say that Uncle George was a gambler and a looker ahead . Uncle George was a mighty patient man , darn near as patient as or Beulah , the Holstein . She was the first cow ever to feel the clumsy caress of my ten thumbs . When I plumb missed the bucket , there was no harsh word or moo of reprimand . Both Uncle George and Beulah simply raised their eyes to the barn roof in silent prayer . I wo n't go into all the details @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is basically a fish story . One thing , though , even then I fancied myself as something of an artist and humorist . Finding a can of red barn paint , all my creative instincts came to the fore . The old outhouse , a two-holer , did n't have much class , and I could see the great possibilities . In my fanciest pseudo-Old English script , I lettered " His " and " Hers " atop the openings , then painted a wild-flower border around ' em for the finishing touch . They looked mighty pretty , with the morning sun streaming in . It never occurred to me that the paint was slow-drying , or that the privy would be semidark when Uncle George made his afternoon run ! For the next couple of days , Uncle George did n't say much to me . Or if he did , I did n't hear him ; I did my chores diligently and pretty much out of earshot , in the interest of self-preservation . By the third day , though , I guess Uncle George saw the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was smart enough to let well enough alone . In kind of an unspoken forgiveness , he said , " Eddard ( he always called me Eddard ) , go dig us some worms . We 're goin ' fishin ' . " I reckon the wind was right , ' cause we caught fish . Our gear was n't fancy  --  bamboo poles , hooks , lines , bobbers , sinkers , worms  --  but it got us a nice mess of perch and " sunnies . " I had n't realized what a philosopher or Unc was . Seems like fishing brings out the best in a man . He told me to be cold still and watch the bobber . It was real peace-ful and relaxing . Except for the birds twittering and insects buzzing , I never heard such silence . After we fished awhile and plopped a couple up on the bank , Uncle George seemed satisfied I 'd got-ten the hang of it . He took me into his confidence . " Eddard , " he stage-whispered , " do n't ever forget what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stage-whispered back , " OK , Uncle George , " sure that I was going to be let in on some deep , dark family secrets . Uncle George unsprawled himself from the shade on the bank . He drew up to his full height of five foot eight , removed his battered straw , raised his right hand with one finger held dramatically aloft , and began to recite : " When the wind is from the west , that 's the time the fish bite best . " I could n't help but think of pictures I 'd seen of Teddy Roosevelt , William Jennings Bryan , and all the great orators . Uncle George was their spittin ' image , ' cept for the flappin ' overhalls . Believe me , I was impressed and overawed . He then pointed the finger at me and commanded , " Repeat that . " I did , word for word , and he said , " Again . " And I did , and he seemed satisfied . He assumed the pose again and orated , " When the wind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fish 's mouth . Repeat ! " I did . The pose , and the Third Revelation ; " When the wind is from the east , there 's no fish for man or beast . " After that one was memorized , he went on to number four , the one about " When the wind is from the north . " But do you know , to this day I ca n't remember what the hell 's s'posed to happen when that north wind is blowing ? Uncle George , Lord bless ' im , is prob'Iy perched up there on his own private cloud , looking down on me in disgust . For several decades after Unc 's dramatic revelations , fishing was just a dream . There was school to finish , a war to fight , and a job to do . Then , one evening after a particularly hard day of head-knocking at the office , my wife and I decided we 'd had it . We 'd chuck the big-city frustrations and do our own thing . And where else but Wonderful Wyoming ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ties , and made the move . ( Would we do it again , you ask ? You betcha ! ) Among other great things , our Big Horn Country is noted for its trout fishing . As the travel folders say , " Clear , rushing mountain streams abound with hungry trout ... a veritable fisherman'sParadise ! " Naturally , the or taste buds started me drooling for those fresh-from-the-stream sizzlers . I charged down to the local Post Office-grocerylicense dispensary almost before we unpacked , my head filled with a vision of Uncle George pointing that finger and saying " Repeat ! " All his verses came back to me ( all , that is , except that bugger about the north ) . Imagine my complete shock and utter chagrin when Milt , the **31;3203;TOOLONG told me a feller had to live in Wyoming a full year before a $3 resident fishing license could be issued . ' Course , he could let me buy a nonresident license for twelve bucks . Or I could try fishing without a license and get socked with a $50 fine if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think it over , and left with a Wyoming Fishing Regulations folder ( free ) . Being part Scotch , part chicken , I could n't see paying the nonresident twelve bucks , and I sure could n't live with myself fishing illegally , even if I did n't get caught . After all , I 'd waited this long  --  another year would be a breeze . What to do ? Practice , man ! Got a whole year to become an expert with dry-run fishing  --  casting on the lawn , learning how to tie the knots the fishermen depend on , reading up on sure-fire ways to catch the wily trout , scouting the streams , all that good stuff . Our local library ( which , amazingly , contains the complete , original mid-1920s Tom Swift series ) supplied me with a couple of excellent books that I know increased my knowledge and confidence a hundredfold . The brand-new fly rod and reel that I 'd received as a Lord-knows-why gift some eight years back came out of the moth balls . Being endowed ( ahem ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no time to consistently hit the bullseye of a three-foot circle in the yard , from distances of thirty to forty feet . Just across the pasture lives our good neighbor and true friend , Harvey Jones . Harvey saw me practicing one day , and confided that he 'd never had much luck  --  could n't cast worth a damn . I handed him my rod and pointed to the target . " Let 's see your swing , Harvey , " I said , unaware for a moment that I sounded more like Jack Nicklaus than lzaak Walton . Harvey ca n't hear too good , so my slip went unnoticed . He took the lightly balanced rod , sighted the target , wound up like a one-armed batter , and let fly , neatly hooking a Ponderosa branch about thirty feet overhead . " Harvey , " I shouted , pro-like , " It 's all in the wrist , man , all in the wrist ! " Harvey looked aloft at the dangling fly rod and muttered , " By the Gods of War ! " which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expression . Throughout the fast-receding summer , we practiced . We went to a couple of ranch sales and picked up odds and ends of cast-off equipment : three rusty rods and reels , some threadbare old flies , and a tackle box and creel  --  all for a buck ! We salvaged parts and came up with a pretty fair spare rod and reel . I divulged Uncle George 's secret poems to Harvey , and rehearsed him till he had ' em letter perfect . ( All except , " When the wind is from the north . . " ? dammit ! ) By the time the aspen leaves had turned to gold , we were ready ! License day finally arrived . We loaded the old pickup and hollered , " Get the skillet hot , " to our wives . Harve 's wife , Dotty Nell , just laughed . She 'd been through this before . My bride , Karen , was n't quite sure . She said she 'd thaw some hamburger. just in case . With a confident wave , we took off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to buy my license . Frankly , 1 was disappointed . 1 expected just a little more fanfare as Milt filled out the forms . After all . it 's not every day that a feller becomes a legal and honest resident of a state . Milt just grinned and wished me luck as he took my three bucks . Harve had the pickup moving almost before I got the door shut . Talk about eager ! " Watch out , fish ! " he ejaculated ( 1 learned that word from the Tom Swift books . It was what old Ned did , instead of merely speaking ) . " Today you meet your masters ! " We reached the ranch where we were going to fish and stopped at the house to get the owner 's blessing . We took off across pasture to hit the stream " where trout abound " about a mile below . Figured we 'd have the back of the pickup filled with our record trout hi nothin ' flat . Why walk all the way back to the ranch house ? We unliberated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few knots that the book had n't mentioned . That ride across the pasture was wild ! Then suddenly I realized a vital fact . It was impossible to see the fine nylon leader , much less tie on a fly or bait a hook , with the naked eye . Luckily , I 'd thought to put my reading glasses in vest pocket " A " and polaroid glasses in pocket " B. " Pocket " C " carried a nail clipper and knife . The polaroids enable you to see the fish in their own natural habitat , right through the glare . The nail clipper is real handy for snipping loose ends or snarled leaders . To date , it 's been my most-used gadget . The knife is for opening up your first trout to see what he 's been feeding on . This last is hearsay . I have n't had to use it yet . Harve and I were finally ready to fish . We jumped a small irrigation ditch without mishap , climbed over a bobwire fence ( where the landing net I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and came out on the twelvefoot-high stream bank . Silhouetted against the sunny , midday sky , we scanned the stream . We noted the gentle breeze from the west . I put on the polaroids , and there they were ! Trout by the jillions , looking right back at us . " Jeez , Harve ! " I shouted , flipping the polaroids to him . " By the Gods of War ! " shouted Harvey . The fish immediately took off in a body . " Harve , " I said , regaining my composure , " we 're going to have to be real quiet and sneak up on them . " Harvey splashed across the stream about fifty feet up . I did n't have waders , and had to fish from the bank . I 'd tied on a lure that sure looked good to me  --  kinda green , with blue eyes . No fish in his right mind could possibly pass it up . I made my cast beautifully . One o'clock to eleven o'clock , then a slight forward flick . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Seems like , when I climbed the fence , my line had taken a couple of turns around the rod head . ( Remember that , Ed . ) I unwound and tried again , aiming for the big feller layin ' in shadow behind the rock in midstream . The lure landed perfectly , floating right to him . He smiled slightly , and I cast again , toying with him . I knew it 'd just be a matter of seconds before his resistance would shatter . Again , he ignored it . Dumb fish . Once more I cast . On the forward flick , I felt a momentary tug , then saw my leader line lazily wafting lureless in front of me . Do n't know if I 'd hooked on the bobwire or the small bush directly behind me , on account of I never did find that blasted irresistible lure , though I fine-toothed the area for twenty minutes . Went to pocket A , then to pocket C , repaired the leader line , and tried to unhook a fly from my vest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hurry . After ten minutes , I cut the vest to get the fly loose . ( Remember that , Ed . ) Finally got all set , and moved downstream , casting expertly on the way . No luck . Just below a fast riffle , I tried again . The line tightened , the rod bent . I played him just like the book said . He did n't really fight , but I could tell he was big and stubborn . By this time , I was off the bank , onto the rocks . One foot slipped into a sluggish pool almost over my boot top , but I ignored it . The struggle of man against fish was all-important . I had him now , reeling him in slowly , landing net ready . As his head broke water , he did n't look quite right . I dropped the landing net  --  I needed both hands to manipulate the threefoot-long , moss-covered willow branch up to where I could salvage the lure . The fly was n't in the best of shape , being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fish were n't perfectionists . Moving downstream , I kept casting . I hooked several nice overhanging branches , lots of moss , and got the rod tip and my hat hung up under some low-lying , thorny tree limbs when four beautiful pheasants spooked up under foot . Meantime , Harvey had worked his way past me and headed back . He noticed my dejected look , but he was too gentlemanly to ask how I 'd done . I could see that he was bursting with pride . He opened his creel . Huddled down in a dingy corner was one miserable little rainbow  --  must 've been all of five or six inches . " Bet he put up one helluva fight , Champ , " I said . " Whaeja catch him on ? " Harve grinned sheepishly and almost whispered , " A worm . " " By the Gods of War , Harvey , " I said . The tiny rainbow was still thriving , so Harve gently dropped him back into the stream . As he took off , laughing happily , we both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when we headed for the pickup . Long streaks of orange and purple were lacing the sky . Real beautiful . A bunch of mule deer had come down from the hills to graze . They hardly looked up as we drove off . " Harve , ol ' buddy , " I said , " we did n't catch a damn fish but we sure had a good day . I know a thousand city fellers who 'd give their eye teeth to be in ( Aar boots . " " You 're thinkin ' my way , Ed , " he said . Right then , he reminded me a little of Uncle George , only he did n't call me Eddard . On the way home , we counted forty-seven deer , mule and whitetail . Yep , we 're kinda " country " up here . Oh . Dotty Nell and Karen had our suppers all ready . Wonder how they knew ? Undaunted , determined and much wiser , Harvey and I thought we 'd try again in a few days . This time we figured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breakfast . We picked our wardrobes the night before . " Nothing bright . " Harvey cautioned . " You do n't want to scare ' em . " Karen and Dotty Nell just snickered when I finally chose my old army outfit . " You sure were anxious to get out of it back then ! " Karen said . " And that pot of yours still looks pretty anxious to get out of it , " guffawed Harvey . " Well , one thing . You sure did n't get it eating fish ! " put in Dotty Nell , real neighborly-like . We got up next morning in the dark and swore not to open our mouths till time to put fish in them . We parked the pickup one mile from the stream . We walked along , picking our feet up and putting them down like we was walking on eggs . Halfway , Harvey raised his hand like my WW II platoon leader used to do . We got down on all fours and crawled the rest of the way . My face was bleeding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scare our little speckled buddies . He halted me twenty feet from the bank . Then , on his belly , he wiggled up to the edge , looked back at me for luck , and let her go . I heard it zing through the air . I knew he 'd get something right off . What he got was shut of his rod . Right after the " zing " I heard the " splat " and I was up to the edge watching it fly downstream . You could almost hear the fish going " Yuk , yuk , " and if there 'd been much light we could 've seen ' em striking at his rod . We took turns on my rod but mainly it was n't the same . Mainly because we did n't snag nothing . Not even a coat hanger . We lasted till I could nearly button the top of the old olive drabs , then headed for the truck . I could have sworn it 'd been moved . Backwards . On the way back Harve told me about this living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traps and fishes for a living and never misses . Ties his own flies and all that pro stuff . Just then , we spotted Riff in his beat-up old Willys and flagged him down . In the middle of the road , Harve shouted introductions . Seems Riff ca n't hear too well either . It turned out he just happened to be headed for our stream , so we joined up . Harvey and I were confident that we 'd learn from the expert and come home with a creelful , if I could just keep my stomach from growling . We got to the stream and pointed out the spot to Riff where the jillion trout were waiting . " Hell , them ai n't trout , them 's suckers ! " Harve and I did n't say a word . We just followed the master . We started working his favorite holes along the stream . Just before dark , we quit . Score : Riff  --  four nice ones . Harvey  --  zero , minus two flies . Ed  --  zero , minus one fly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't right , the fish were n't biting , it was a generally bad fishing day , and he was just lucky to catchfour . He cleaned ' em on the bank and insisted that we take ' em home to the " women folk " and brag on our catch . Since he told us he never ate fish , we took ' em , but we did n't have the heart to lie to the gals about our prowess . Next afternoon , I thought I 'd try solo fishing in a little runoff stream just across the road from our house . Expecting nothing , I had exactly one worm and one fly with me . After the usual pocket A , pocket B bit , I tried the worm . Pow ! Rainbow ! A nice pan-size ten-incher . I was too excited to figure where the wind was from , but I think it was the north . Anyway , with worm demolished , I tied on the fly . Nothing fancy , just some little old brown thing that I would n't give a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time a nineincher . By now it was too dark to even get the hook out , so I proudly walked across the water with my catch . Karen was astounded . As I was cleaning my fish , I carefully checked their innards to see what they 'd been feeding on . They were plumb empty . Those fish had been starving ! No wonder they took my bait . Harvey 'd been in town all day . He called up after supper to say he 'd signed us up in a new conservation club called SOT . " What 's that stand for ? " I asked him . " Save Our Trout , " he said , laughing his silly head off . When he sobered up , I told him of my remarkable catch . After a minute of silence , he said , " By the Gods of War ! I do n't believe it ! " Told him I 'd prove it to him the next Sunday morning . Saturday night he called to say they were leaving on a trip and he could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my upcoming catch at supper some night . By 7 a.m . Sunday , I was out whipping the stream . I could see trout in every nook and cranny . I crept up on all fours so they would n't see me . Anyone watching would have called the fuzz . I tried the flies , dropping ' em silently and expertly in front of the noses of several nice-size fellers . Nothing . I tried worms , letting ' em drift slowly , naturally , down toward the open mouths . Nothing . As the morning progressed , I inadvertently cleaned out several small clusters of branches and natural debris from the streambed . And , ecologists , please note , I picked up four beer cans and a hub cap for deposit in the trash can . I thought sure the fish would appreciate all this and at least make a pass at my offerings . No soap . Shortly after noon , Karen brought over a corned beef sandwich . I gulped down all but a bit of the beef . No fish can resist corned beef @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the delicacy right smack in front of a couple swimming up-stream side by side , Figured at least one of ' em would have a taste for the good life . Uh , uh . Nary a nibble . Another hour passed , and I gave up . No doggone fish is gon na make a monkey out of me ! Something half buried in the sandy bottom caught my eye . I got my sleeve wet , but dug out an old Coke bottle . On the bottom of the bottle were the words , " Bottled in Lead , S. Dak . " Knowing full well that the Lead , S. Dak .. bottling plant has been out of business since about Uncle George 's time , I sold the bottle to a neighbor lady who collects that stuff . She gave me five bucks for it and was overjoyed at her bargain . I been back several times now . When I say " several , " well , you know what I mean . Karen complains I never spend any time with her anymore , and says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exotics as Wild-African-Congo Tsetse-spit flies and such , not to mention the case of dog food I threw in when I read that " ponds and slow streams , when properly fertilized , encourage certain species to remain in desirable areas . " Wherever the " desirable areas " are around here , I ai n't found ' ern . Well , soon as Harve gets back , we 'll give the trout a few more tries . If we do n't improve , we can always make a few bucks in the old bottle business . And not all those old bottles have to he empty , huh ? Harvey ? You listenin ' Uncle George ?
