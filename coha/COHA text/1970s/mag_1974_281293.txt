Medicare does a good job of taking care of the elderly once they are ill , but the seven-year-old program provides little in the way of regular preventive care . A 67-bed community hospital in Prosser ( pop . 3,000 ) , in southeastern Washington , has come up with a unique service to fill this gap . It provides those over 65 with monthly checkups at a bargain-basement price of only $6 per year . <P> The key to the Prosser plan lies in using the institution 's staff and facilities at off times . " Hospitals have peak periods when all of the personnel are at work , " explains Hospital Administrator Larry Mclntyre , who developed the plan with the institution 's chief of staff , Dr. Gustav Bansmer . " But there are other times when a lot of them are just standing around , so when we utilize that time there is no added cost . " To take advantage of these slack periods , the hospital requires patients to make appointments in advance . <P> The hospital further increases efficiency by scheduling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's exam consisted of chest X rays ; this month 's will involve blood tests and urinalysis . For women , the March checkup will include Pap smears , which help detect cervical cancer , and men will undergo prostate examinations . Leg and foot examinations are scheduled for April , while eye examinations are planned for May . The 12-month cycle will start again next January . <P> Social Occasion . If test results indicate that a patient needs treatment , he is immediately referred to his own physician . Bansmer believes that the monthly examinations will enable doctors to detect early signs of illness in patients who frequently do not get regular checkups . In addition , many members of Prosser 's eldercare program look forward to the monthly hospital outings as social occasions that give them a chance to see friends . <P> The Prosser plan has already enrolled 362 elderly people , many of whom are attracted by the low cost . " When you get older , you have to watch your pennies , " says Mrs. Helen Erickson , 69 . " You would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think of going for a checkup . " Other hospitals have expressed interest in copying the program . Prosser Memorial Hospital has had inquiries from health officials across the nation , and officials of two nearby hospitals are so impressed that they are thinking about setting up a Prosser plan in their own communities .
