txt The New York City Transit Authority last evening proposed a new package of cuts in subway and bus services , particulady in the early morning hours , to make up for what it said was an " anticipated budget shortfall of $30 million . " The agency said it intended to save that amount over an 18-month period , starting Jan. 1 , by dropping two shuttle services and some non-rush-hour express service , drastically shortening train lengths in slack periods , lengthening waiting times between buses in off hours , closing part-time token booths at various subway stations throughout the city and dismissing 181 former city and Housing Authority policemen the transit agency hired to work in those booths as clerks . The economies , the authority said , had been sent to the city for submission to the Emergency Financial Control Board , which has been overseeing the state 's mandate that the city and autonomous agencies live within their budgets in keeping with the stringent fiscal restrictionsimposed since mid-1975 . An earlier plan from the authority , which had been reducing its work force @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was rejected because it relied too heavily on what has been called " Beame-shuffle " borrowing . The " shuffle " involves the " temporary use " of Federal capital grants for operating purposes , and officials said the authority had counted on such funds without even having received permission to convert them to such use . Yesterday 's announcement continued the disagreement over the Transit Authority 's expected budget deficit . The Emergency Financial Control Board , in its most recent orders for the Transit Authority , had called for a $42 million savings plan , but the authority put the " shortfall " at only $30 million . ' Shuffle ' Proposed At the same time , the authority proposed a " shuffle " of $47 million in Federal construction funds to operations during fiscal 1977 to overcome its remaining cash-flow problems . It said $26 million of that amount would be guaranteed for repayment by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority from its Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority investment income . Repayment of the remaining $21 million remained somewhat unclear . The authority 's announcement said the sum was " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the city and the Board of Education in the curtailment of special-fare programs for the elderly and schoolchildren . Asked how that part of the " shuffle " . was . to be repaid , . an Authority spokesman said last night . that the money would " ultimately " have to come from the city . The . Mayor 's office withheld comment pending a study of the proposals , which were received only late yesterday . A similar " shuffle " involving $37 million was proposed by the Transit Authority for fiscal 1978 , with the state and The city expected to make good most of it in view of the " reductions in reimbursements for schoolchildren and senior citizens . " The agency 's revised program of service reductions comes on top of a fare raise from 35 to 50 cents in September 1975 , further declines in ridership since then and the elimination of a total of 855 daily train runs  --  to 6,337 ? in 1975 and last Aug. 30 . The cuts effective in January would eliminate altogether the Bowling GreenSouth Ferry shuttle of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brooklyn and the AA local service on the IND in Manhattan between Chambers Street and 168th Street-Broadway . To replace the AA trains , the A line would become a local service during non-rush hours , while B and CC trains would continue to provide local service on that run during rush periods . Other cutbacks would affect GG , N and B subway lines during the late night hours . The authority said it would stop GG trains between 10 P.M. and 5 A.M. at Queens Plaza instead of the present terminus at 71st Street/Continental Avenue in Forest Hills , although the line 's Brooklyn terminus would remain Smith/Ninth Streets . Service to Forest Hills would still be provided by F trains as at present . Between 1 A.M. and 5 A.M. , the authority said , N and B trains would run from . Coney Island to 36th Street in Brooklyn rather than to 57th Street in , Manhattan . This would mean that passengers on the N line would have to transfer at the Brooklyn station to RR trains to 57th Street and Seventh Avenue in Manhattan , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 36th Street or DeKalb Avenue in Brooklyn and , for stations along the Avenue of the Americas , transfer again at 34th Street in Manhattan to D or F trains . To save on the cost of power and maintenance , the authority further proposed to cut its present 10-car trains to eight , six or four cars during slack periods , with a train 's length depending on how many passengers were carried in such off hours . The longer waiting times for buses , also proposed only for non-rush-hour traffic , would affect passengers on most routes in all the five boroughs , the authority said . Headways between buses would be increased by five to 20 minutes . According to an authority spokesman , exact schedules had not been worked out yet , pending action on the plan by the Emergency Financial Control Board . But he indicated that the longest additional headways , stretching waiting times to as much as half an hour , would affect only buses that now carry as few as one or two passengers at a time in outlying areas during the early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
