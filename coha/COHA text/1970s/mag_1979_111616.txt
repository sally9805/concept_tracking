Pete Ashlock , boxing manager and promoter , pushes back his $300 cowboy hat and contemplates the glories of the Florida sun and the complexities of his personality . " I 'd say I am the most honest , generous , upright , benevolent person in the whole world , " he says . And how would he describe himself if he were telling the truth ? " I 'd say I 'm a sorry , no-good s.o.b. , but if I was better educated , I 'd do better . " // No one questions Ashlock 's savvy , but everyone agrees that in an earlier life he was probably a thorn . He operates out of Orlando . Among his detractors are the U.S. Government , which once filed a six-count tax-evasion indictment against him , and Orlando city fathers , who ca n't stand  --  or understand  --  Ashlock 's brand of Old West individualism and straight talk . He says the cornerstone of his philosophy is " Do n't ever say no until you hear the price . " // Veteran fight manager and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fair and his word is truly his bond . " That 's the scouting report on Ashlock . If he gives you his word , take it to the bank . His promises do n't take funny bounces . Ashlock is among the last of those who think that all things are possible as long as you do them yourself . " When I decide to have a board meeting , " says the self-made millionaire , " it takes about two seconds for everybody to get there and vote . And what you 've got to remember is there ai n't one Government employee who will ever help you do anything , but that every one of ' em will try to keep you from doing something . " // A perfect example of how Ashlock , a former Texas rodeo cowboy , flies in the face of conventional wisdom is his boxing club in Orlando , which is both a club for boxers and an arena in which club fighters appear . Whatever made Ashlock think that a fight club , which stages pro bouts every other Tuesday night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says Ashlock . " I never thought it would succeed . Orlando ai n't a sports town . " So why try ? " I like it . Besides , you got to build talent somewhere . Why not here ? " // Sure enough , boxing is n't succeeding in Orlando . Indeed , it 's an abject failure , financially . Townspeople stay away in droves from his Orlando Sports Stadium , which could seat 9,500 for boxing ; the biggest crowd ever was 3,858 , and 1,000-1,200 is closer to normal . But Ashlock perseveres , saying , " When a promoter quits dreaming about a full house , he 'd better get out of the business . A good promoter has always got to have a good excuse . That 's the most important thing . Like when we have a small crowd , I say , ' Well , the Winn-Dixie store stayed open too late . ' It does n't matter how good the excuse is , long as you got one . " // Still , Ashlock 's club  --  about 15 pros are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fighters are also members  --  is one of the busiest boxing facilities in the country . It is thus a blockbuster success , artistically . Dundee credits Ashlock with being one of the nation 's most active promoters . New York matchmaker Gil Clancy says , " Ashlock is n't impossible to deal with . All he wants is the best match and the most money . " There are only four boxing capitals in the U.S. : New York , Los Angeles , Las Vegas and Orlando . Chris Dundee , the Miami promoter , says of Ashlock , " He 's got to love boxing , because God knows how much money he has lost on it . " // Ashlock has lost money on every one of his boxing shows . Conversely , he makes money on every one of his weekly wrestling shows . This year he 'll stage 155 events in the Sports Stadium , including rodeos , horse shows , rock shows and boxing . The other night he took in $5,126 on a boxing card ; his expenses were $7,000 . " Do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a $1,900 ticket and I had a good time . " And in the post-midnight shadows of the barnlike stadium , he explains that " when you 're trying to sell the public something you like , you 're at their mercy . If we 'd had more people tonight , I 'd have lost less , and if we 'd had less people , I 'd have lost more . But boxing is an individual thing and I like that . And if I keep two or three kids off the street or out of jail , it 's worth it to me. " // But Ashlock really keeps going , he says , for one reason : " My hope is getting me a champion . " Ever since that day in 1969 when Dean Chance , the American League 's Cy Young Award winner in 1964 , walked into Ashlock 's office , said he owned a fighter and asked Ashlock to put on a card , Ashlock has been hooked . That only 1,200 fans showed up for the occasion is proof that Ashlock was easy to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like anyone else 's , but a New York friend and promoter , Frank Curry , says , " The thing that 's different about Pete is that he 's willing to take a chance and to back up his conviction with cash . " // Indeed , when the ABA was in business , league officials encouraged Ashlock to buy a basketball floor and hinted at the possibility of a franchise . Says Ashlock , " I spent $33,000 for a floor , got three ABA games , lost $7,500 on each one  --  and did n't meet a gentleman in the whole mess . " He sold his floor for $12,500 . When Ashlock got the closed-circuit television rights for Orlando for the 1974 Ali-Foreman fight , he spent $18,000 to advertise it on the side of city buses for a month . Seven days before the month was up , the fight was postponed . The delay guaranteed another money-losing event for Ashlock , but he did it all over again . " The only way you can kill a damn cowboy , " he says , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . " // Curry also says that anything Ashlock sets out to do eventually gets done . So if the phrase " ... wearing red trunks , the world champion from Orlando , Florida ... " does n't sound very plausible , who 's to say it might not someday ? But even Dominick Polo , who trains Ashlock 's boxers , is candid when asked to name the best fighter ever to come out of Orlando : " None . " // The star , if fading , of the Ashlock stable is Edgar ( Mad Dog ) Ross , a 154-pounder who once held the North American junior welterweight crown . But Mad Dog Ross has never won the titles of the organizations that count , the World Boxing Council ( which once ranked him as the No. 3 junior welterweight ) or the World Boxing Association . Ashlock remembers when Ross drifted into the Orlando gym three years ago . " You talk about a wild , rank bum , " he says . " He did n't give a damn for nothing . He was just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fights were hard to come by , says Polo , because his record was too good . // Edgar ( " That does n't sound like a fighter , does it ? Sounds like a poet " ) got his nickname back home in Tuscaloosa after a furious sparring session with a heavyweight . " Man , " said the bigger man , shaking his head , " you fight like a mad dog . " " Every town has its Top 10 toughest guys , " says Ross . " I wanted to be in the Top 10 in Tuscaloosa. " // Ross staged his fights ( " I was a pretty good promoter , too , just like Mr. Ashlock " ) either in the parking lot of the McDonald 's across from the high school or in Bowers Park . He recalls that folks would show up with knives , guns and tire tools . " I 'd fight and the war would be on , " says Ross . " Several people would always be carried off to the hospital . Worst of all , sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you fight like hell . Once a guy raised his pistol at me and fired it point-blank . I knew he could n't miss me , and when the gun went off I figured I was so excited that I just did n't feel it . " The shot somehow missed . Ross later served in the Navy , firing guns on a destroyer off Vietnam . He spent his service years fighting and carousing , and by 1970 he was back in Tuscaloosa , looking for trouble and doing pills . He 'd buy them by the gross at a truck stop . " I could n't see where I was going , but that was only because I was n't going anywhere , " he says . Then he fell in with Ashlock . Mad Dog has now become a solid citizen , even to the point of attending college . He rents a small house with orange trees in the backyard . He barbecues chicken for neighbor kids ( in turn , they rake his yard ) , plays Scrabble and lives with his two dogs . // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went to Kansas City recently for a $17,000 payday against Tony Chiaverini , the WBC 's seventh-ranked middleweight . Ross ' biggest previous purse had been $1,600 . " He 's not going to throw anything I have n't seen before , " Ross was saying before the fight . And , indeed , Chiaverini did n't . Just a lot more and a lot harder . In the ninth round , Ross was knocked down . In the 10th , the embattled Mad Dog suffered a technical knockout . He later allowed that it was as bad a whipping as he 'd ever taken , even counting Tuscaloosa . And the future is n't too bright . Ross is 31 years old , and while he denies he 's over the hill , that 's probably just where he is. // Ross remains a local hero , however , and every time he fights he ups the gate by $3,000 to $5,000 . " When I get another star , " says Ashlock , " every jerk in town will come out to get his autograph and pass on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or lucky . " // One of Ashlock 's putative stars was Scott Clark , who got a title fight in Los Angeles in January against WBA welterweight champion Jose Pepino Cuevas . Clark was knocked out in the second round . At 20 , he has more time to come back , if he wants to . " I 'm not going to worry myself about losing a boxing match , " he says . " Depression is a bad thing . Look , if I have some talent , it 'll show up . And if I do n't , it 'll show up . " Clark still considers himself a good fighter , which is one reason why he feels he can get away with wearing a gold velvet robe and trunks . Was it fighting so far from home that hurt him against Cuevas ? " Oh , no . I 've been booed in Orlando , " he says . " But I have a great future . Why should n't I ? I 'm young and white and I can talk . " // Ashlock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human beings like Clark . " He 's a splendid young man who stands to make a lot of money , " Ashlock says . " But all I can do is plant the potato crop , then pray for rain and sunshine  --  and that it do n't get too cold . " Ashlock gets a third of his boxers ' purses ( with Ross , they 're split 50-50 ) when they start fighting main events . // Another of Ashlock 's hopefuls was Termite Watkins , the WBC 's seventh-ranked lightweight , who fights out of Orlando and Houston . But Termite went to New York , ran into one Teo Osuna , and the fight ended in a draw . Sitting glumly in Madison Square Garden , Ashlock grumped after the decision , " Heck , that other kid could n't hit Termite in the backside with a handful of rice . " But , in truth , Osuna almost surely deserved a win . Upon reflection , Ashlock agreed . // The Orlando fighter considered to have the best chance of winning a title is lightweight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and now a matchmaker in Las Vegas , calls Noel a " good ring machine . " Says Ashlock , " He can put you to sleep with either hand . " // When Ashlock blew into Orlando after his professional cowboy days were done , with the intention of promoting a rodeo , the city gave him so much grief about using its auditorium that he went out and put up his own building for $740,000 . How did he plan to make money by having one rodeo a year in the place ? " That was n't the point , " he says . " I like rodeo . " His architects presented him with a plan that called for 468 tons of steel  --  " Which I could n't afford , " Ashlock says . So he redesigned the structure , used 168 tons of steel , and now people come around to study how it was done . // When the county would n't pave the dirt road that led to Ashlock 's Orlando Sports Stadium , he bought the materials himself . The county grudgingly contributed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the city 's regular ticket outlets would n't do business with him , he utilized the Clock Tavern and the Point After Lounge . Because Orlando did n't have a suitable boxing gym , Ashlock built one himself at the back of the stadium , out by the swamp with the alligators. // As boxing gyms go , the gym itself is positively elegant . Obviously , the warm weather and sunshine seeping in help enormously . Polo , a onetime heavyweight , who envisions himself as a mixture of Napoleon and Caesar , runs a taut ship . Signs advise spectators not to go beyond the ropes , talk to the fighters , smoke , drink ( beer or booze ) or talk loudly . Boxers are told not to spit , do karate , lean on the ropes or put their hands and/or feet on the wall . Polo , who reminds listeners  --  even if nobody asks  --  " My record is 263-plus wins and only 19 losses , " is a bug on neatness . He is also a bug on erasing the traditional image of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have a club to develop fighters and I have club fighters , " Polo says . " A club fighter sounds like a loser who fights in a basement once every five months . My fighters are n't that . They polish their shoes and make sure their robes are n't wrinkled . At least they can look good . " // From the viewpoint of Angelo Dundee , Ashlock looks awfully good . " As a promoter , you 've got to be able to suck it up , " he says . " Pete does . If he does n't have ulcers , he should have . " Ashlock pays around $125 for a four-round fighter , up to $400 for an eight-rounder and between $600 and $5,000 for a main-event boxer . Plus expenses . And he knows that his interest in his fighters will sometimes go unrequited . James Salerno , a promising light heavyweight , recently left him . Harsh words are frequent in the fight game because , Ashlock explains , " Very few of these guys save their money . Then when they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking for an excuse . Sometimes I 'm it . " However , Ashlock does n't squirm when payoff time is at hand . Bruce Trampier , who used to work for Ashlock , says , " I 've seen a lot of times when everyone went out of the stadium with money  --  except Pete . " // Ashlock dropped out of school back in Texas ... well , he thinks , along about the ninth grade . " I had to ride horseback 14 miles to get there , " he says . " Do you have any idea how many side roads there are in 14 miles ? " // When he quit rodeoing in 1951 , he split for Orlando . " My financial success is purely accidental , " he says . " All I did was recognize Florida as a frontier and drop a few bucks into it . " He bought a bulldozer and cleared land . Watching others erect buildings on land he cleared , he decided he might as well put up buildings , too . He also did paving . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bases in Oklahoma and Texas . But the prime contractor went broke just before Ashlock was to be paid and left owing him $600,000 . Cigar clenched in teeth , Ashlock says coldly , " To collect from dear old Uncle Sam took me nine years , 11 months , 17 days . " // Ashlock then got to thinking about cranes , having had to rent a number of them for his building projects . He decided to buy the cranes himself and do the renting . He got into the Cape Kennedy building boom , then Walt Disney World . " Whenever I heard of work , " he says , " I 'd spend anywhere from $30,000 to $180,000 on another crane . " In August of 1973 , his 27 cranes were making him $66,000 a month ; in September , business fell off and his cranes were making him $6,000 a month . Says Ashlock , " Funny thing , but I never wanted more than a couple of cranes anyway . " // Although the Government failed to convict Ashlock on any of the tax-evasion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was flying in witnesses from all over the world against me . " But he does n't think they 'll come after him again , because " I stand peaceful with them  --  if they stand peaceful with me. " // But peace is rarely Ashlock 's portion . Eight years ago the Orlando Sentinel ran a headline that said ONE DEAD , DOZENS HURT IN ROCK RIOT AT STADIUM . In fact , two young women were killed after their car was rammed by a sheriff 's car en route to the stadium , about 3.2 miles away . Ashlock sued the Sentinel Star Company , which publishes both the Sentinel and the Orlando Evening Star , for $10 million . The suit was dismissed and appeals denied . // Thus , because Ashlock is demonstrably a fighter , liking fighters makes sense . He promises that each of his top boxers will get a title fight before 1981 . All he expects from them is effort . An example of effort , he says , is a friend of his " who can still run 15 miles , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't like what you 're doing . " // Most of all , while others scratch their heads and say ca n't and do n't , Ashlock says yes and does . When his daughter was born while the Ashlocks were visiting in Dallas , he bought an airplane for $38,000 and flew the family to Orlando . " I wanted to get home , " Ashlock says . His wife , Mary , says , " There is n't another like him . " In a restaurant , Pete asks for onion slices and twice is brought pitiful little slices . He promptly gets up , walks across the street , buys an onion , comes back , slices it in huge pieces and eats it . // " I 've never met my equal , " he says . " And if I die tomorrow , there 's not a damn thing I missed . "
