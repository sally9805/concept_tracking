" It 's good to I. ) e ' back in : the world 's greatest city , " he said beaming , shortly after his plane from Bermuda touched down at Kennedy International Airport at 4:10 P.M. Although the 52-year-old former Mayor lauded the virtues of being a private citizen and was notably vague about his immediate plans , his comments left little doubt that he is , at some point , prepared to con. : sider running again for elective office . Ticking off the options by squeezing the fingers of one hand , he said : " I 'm more politician than I am actor . I 'm more politician than I am writer . I 'm more politician than I am lawyer . " Accompanied by his wife , Mary , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ features deeply tanned from skiing in the Alps , sailing through the Greek isles and touring Ireland  --  appeared surprised and a little pleased by the throng of Mr. Lindsay said he was prepared to lend his support , including possibly speaking engagements , on behalf of Howard J. Samuels , who is contesting the Democratic gubernatorial nomination against Representative Hugh L. Carey . Mr. Lindsay endorsed Mr. Samuels in a letter written from Paris last month . The former Mayor added , when asked , that he would support whoever won the primary , over Governor Wilson . He said he was not prepared at this time to make endorsements of other candidates , such as those running for the United States Senate . " I 've been away so long I have to get my feet on the ground , " he said . " I got my first exposure to The New York Times three days ago , and that was a culture shock I 'm still recovering from . " Mr. Lindsay did say that he was considering " reconnecting " with his old law firm , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at 1 Rockefeller Plaza . Mr. Lindsay worked there as a lawyer from 1948 to ' 1959 , when he went to Washington as a young Congressman from the Upper East Side .

America , " which is scheduled to begin Jan. 6 , 1975 , Mr. Lindsay would not disclose his salary . Mr. Lindsay 's endorsement of Mr. Samuels cost him a job as an analyst and commentator for WCBS-TV during the Sept. 10 primary and the Nov. 5 general election .

" I 'm glad that it 's finished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start again . " It 's a much healthier atmosphere now . It 's been a very bad time for politics and politicians , and it will take many , ' many years to rebuild the faith in government . " He added that President serving together in Congress for seven years , had made a " good start . " " I have terribly high hopes for him , " he said . During his vacation , the former Mayor mostly relaxed by skiing , cruising and touring . He also managed to find time , he said , to write " some articles and essays " and to stop over in Paris for several days and put in a cameo appearance in a film called " Rosebud , " directed by his old friend , Otto Preminger . The Lindsays , who will live in a cooperative apartment in the Hotel Des Artistes , at 1 West 67th Street , returned somewhat ahead of schedule . The reason , Mrs. Lindsay said , was that their son has a date with a dentist . " The dentist changed his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she observed in awry tone . ' " Still , I 'm glad we 're back , " she said . " You begin to miss your friends . " Then , after chatting a bit more , the three stepped into a black limousine sent by Mayor Beame that carried them to their new home . cameramen and newsmen that greeted him and turned a corridor on the lower tier of the Pan American terminal into the scene of an impromptu news conference . Is he thinking of running for the Senate seat of James L. Buckley in 1976 ? " I 'm really not ready to think in those terms , " he said , frowning , " I 'm not sure I 'm ready to go through the whole business Ford , whom he knew from again . " Ten minutes later , he was asked roughly the same question . " Who knows , " he replied , now ' smiling . " You have to put yoiir feet in the water . " Five minutes later , the question came again . " Maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
