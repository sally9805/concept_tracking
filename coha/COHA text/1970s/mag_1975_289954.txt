Anatoly Marchenko , a well-known dissident Soviet author , was sentenced in Kaluga last week to four years of banishment , probably to Siberia . The story of that case has not yet appeared in the West , but it will break this week in the latest issue of A Chronicle of Human Rights in the USSR , a bimonthly magazine published in Manhattan . Since its founding two years ago last month , the little Chronicle , which is edited by Valery Chalidze and Pavel Litvinov , a pair of liberal Soviet exiles now living in the U.S. , has become one of the most carefully read and respected Russian journals anywhere . <P> The publication is a cousin to the Moscow Chronicle of Current Events , a samizdat ( publish it yourself ) typewritten journal put out irregularly since April 1968 inside Russia and circulated hand to hand among Soviet dissidents . The New York Chronicle 's 600 English-language and 300 Russian-language copies reach some of those dissidents as well as Soviet exiles in the West . There are also some impressive above-ground names on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Peking , Britain 's Parliament and Western universities and libraries . <P> Latest News . Between its plain blue covers , the New York Chronicle packs as many as 128 pages with the latest on arrests , imprisonments and other official Soviet harassment , the texts of government decrees squeezing civil liberties in the U.S.S.R. , copies of correspondence between Soviet dissidents and their supporters in the West , as well as manifestoes , open letters and appeals for amnesty from persecuted Soviet dissenters . <P> Considered highly reliable , the Chronicle recently printed a list of all the items lifted by the KGB in a search of Physicist Andrei Tverdokhlebov 's Moscow apartment ( including a copy of Alexander Solzhenitsyn 's The Gulag Archipelago and three issues of the Chronicle ) . In addition to news of Marchenko 's fate , the Chronicle has a chilling , 70-page report written in Solzhenitsynian detail on the conditions endured by Russia 's current political prisoners . Says Chalidze : " We do n't use something unless we 're absolutely sure it is real . " <P> Much of the Chronicle 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ return addresses mailed from the U.S.S.R. Fast-breaking news sometimes gets through by long-distance telephone . Last week Litvinov succeeded in reaching Anatoly Marchenko 's wife Larissa on the phone after Soviet operators had earlier cut them off in mid-conversation . " Larissa told me that Tolya short for Anatoly was brought before the judge in heavy handcuffs , " Litvinov reports . " He looked weak and sick , almost fainted twice during the sentencing . He has been on a hunger strike for 35 days , and will continue until he is completely free . His life is in great danger . "
