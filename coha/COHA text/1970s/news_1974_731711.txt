txt In a hitherto secret report on the DC-10 crash near Paris last March , the Federal Aviation Administration has . been charged by its own inquiry board with " questionable " actions in ' certifying the plane and with being " ineffective " in enforcing corrective steps after a neardisaster in 1972 . The high-level report , made in inid-April , came to light as pressure mounted on the F.A.A. to order nevu , safety measures for the more than 160 DC-10 's already in service . A key point in the 41-page document was that changes already made in the rear cargo door , the loss of which caused both DC-10 accidents , might fall short of what was desirable . The passage in the report dealing with this matter struck some observers as somewhat contradictory . But it was generally interpreted as meaning that the investigators felt more improvements could be made in the interests of safety . The passage reads as follows : " While there is no longer any doubt that it the door is safe , it is an inelegant design worthy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prohibition against such design , prudent design practice would suggest reconsideration of this arrangement . " The Douglas Corporation , builder of the plane , said in reply to a query this week that no change in the fundamental design of the door system was being planned . The Paris crash , in which 346 persons died , was the worst air tragedy in history . The New York Times has also learned that the chairman of a House committee looking into the jumbo jet 's problems recently wrote the F.A.A. saying that it seemed advisable that all ** receive another extensive design improvement now slated only for planes coming off the production line starting next fall . The change is entirely separate from the door system . It will provide an elaborate system of vents to allow relief of air pressure in either upper or lower compartments of a plane if a hole is suddenly opened in the fuselage because of a door loss , a bomb blast or other mishap . In the Paris case , the abrupt loss of pressure in the cargo hold caused the floor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jamming the vital control cables running from the pilot 's control column to the tail surfaces . It turned gut that Douglas had failed to incorporate on the plane a key desigr improvement devised after the near-crash in 1972 . The latest improvement plan , for planes that start being delivered late next year , calls not onV for sizable relief vents but also for strengthening the passenger - cabin floor . However , Representative Harley 0 . Staggers , head of the Special Subcommittee on Investigations , limited himself to urging installation of the venting system . " I 'm not taking the position , " said the West Virginia Democrat , " that any time a manufacturer improves his aircraft , the presumption is raised that the earlier version was unsafe . It appears , however , in light of previous aircraft experience , safety board recommendations and views within the F.A.A. itself , that fleetwide venting should be accomplished at the earliest opportunity . " The National Transportation Safety Board , to which Mr. Staggers referred , also prodded the F.A.A. earlier this month on what it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sudden decompression , whatever the cause . It was the safety board that first urged the Federal Aviation Administration to order venting of ** This was in July , 1972 , soon after a cargo door blew off a DC-10 over Windsor , Ont . The pilot was able to land the crippled plane safely , possibly because the light load ( only 67 persons on board ) meant the floor collapsed with much less force than in the Paris disaster . With pressures building for an F.A.A. rule making venting mandatory , several airlines here and abroad were known to have approached Douglas about having their current DC-10 's overhauled to include at least the new venting system . Will Discuss Fitting The company has long taken the position that , with the cargo door improvements already made , the DC-10 is as safe as any airliner in service . But it is willing to discuss voluntary " retrofitting " of planes already flying . The corollary argument of the manufacturer , an argument that predates the Paris crash , is that the issue of protecting planes from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jumbo jets  --  the Boeing 747 , Lockheed L1011 and the European A-300B as well as the DC-10 . Aviation experts , while agreeing that the problem may be industry-wide , stress that the DC-10 , on the record , seems , nost vulnerable . It is the only jumbo that has had anything close to an accident because of decompression . An extra motivation for the Douglas stance , the experts suggest , is the fact that it is the defendant in tens of millions of dollars ' worth of lawsuits growing out of the P. aris crash . Other defendants include the F.A.A. , Turkish Airlines , which operated the plane , and the General Dynamics Corporation , builder of the cargo door . Tight Lid on Report The lawsuits may also explain why the F.A.A. has kept tight security on the report of the inquiry board it set up after the Paris disaster . The 10-man team was headed by Oscar Bakke , associate administrator for aviation safety . He has since retired from the F.A.A. , primarily because the Department of Transportation vetoed plans of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bakke in charge of all safety programs of the agency . The F.A.A. is a part of the Transportation Department . The internal F.A.A. report , which Mr. Staggers 's committee was reported aware of , charged that the ** initial compliance with the agency 's rules " now appears questionable in the light of the two accidents involving rapid decompression . " The rules inelude criteria by which the F.A.A. must certify that a plane is safe and airworthy before it is allowed in airline service . The report said , for one thing , that " the possibilities of improper door operation " evidently were " not given adequate consideration " by the F.A.A. officials in charge of certification . Found Analyses Lacking It said , too , that , in view of the " catastrophic consequences " of a door failure , detailed safety analyses should have been made before the system was certified as complying with a rule stating that chances of such failure must be only one in a billion . " No such analyses were submitted to the certificating office , " the document added @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ response to the near-crash over Canada , saving the agency was " not effective in attaining adequate fleetwide corrective action on a timely basis . " The in-house investigators ended their report with eight recommendations . At least two of the priority items are known to have been adopted . One called on the F.A.A. chief to make use of mandatory " airworthiness directives " in all future cases when design changes are needed to " correct an unsafe condition . " The changes devised by the manufacturer after the incident over Canada were handled on a voluntary basis after a " gentleman 's agreement " with the F.A.A. Another proposal the F.A.A. has acted on called for a thorough review of " airworthiness standards " for aircraft to see if changes were needed to cope with sudden decompression . It could not be determined if the aviation agency had adopted another proposal singling out the DC-10 for an " immediate in-depth technical reassessment " to see if more could be done about the decompression hazard . It Seemed likely that this had been accepted . However , when asked what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ F.A.A. spokesman said there could be no comment because the in-house document had not been made public .
