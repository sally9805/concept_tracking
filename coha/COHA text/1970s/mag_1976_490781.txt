THE MOODS OF A STONE THE general trend of art in this century has been somewhat discouraging for collectors , many of whom still harbor a fugitive belief that works of art ought to serve some decorative purpose . Collectors find it sad and rather perverse that so few contemporary artists paint nice , framable pictures that look good over the living-room sofa , preferring instead to produce giant canvases too unwieldy for anything but a museum wall , or jagged sculptural constructions that imperil one 's living space , if not one 's very safety , or , worse yet , deliberately ephemeral works  --  Australian coastlines wrapped in polypropylene , mile-long furrows in thi desert  --  which can he preserved only by means of photographs . Just as it was beginning to seem as though collectors might be phased out of the contemporary art scene entirely , however , a surprising thing happened : A number of leading American artists became interested in making lithographic prints . The old-fashioned , painstaking process of fine-art lithography , which had more or less died out here in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during the last two decades , and in the living rooms of more than a few collectors lithographs have begun to hang prominently on the walls  --  even , in some cases , over the sofa . What is sometimes referred to as a " renaissance " in American lithography is not , strictly speaking , a renaissance at all , simply because there was never a real tradition of fine-art lithography here . Winslow Homer , George Bellows , Arthur B. Davies , Thomas Hart Benton , and others made prints , to be sure , but their lithographic work was not particularly distinguished , and it formed only a minor part of their total oeuvre ; until recently , in fact , the only American-born artist who did significant work in lithography and whose lithographs can be said to compare in quality and inventiveness with those of his European contemporaries was James Abbott McNeill Whistler , an expatriate living in England . The reason for this is simple . Lithography , the most complex of the print techniques , requires for its use as an art form the closest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself a master of this difficult craft . The tradition of master lithographic printers has survived for well over a century in France , and most of the major French artists , from Toulouse-Lautrec and Manet to Picasso and Matisse , have made lithographs that stand as important works of art . In the United States , however , the commercial applications of the medium have always predominated , and the number of lithographic printers able and willing to collaborate with artists has been extremely limited . All print techniques , of course , were developed originally for commercial purposes . The woodblock , which had been used in Europe since early Christian times to stamp patterns on textiles , proved to be a cheap and efficient method of illustrating the hooks that proliferated in the fifteenth century as a result of Gutenberg 's invention of movable type . The intaglio techniques of etching and engraving , which date from the mid-fifteenth century and the beginning of the sixteenth , respectively , were from the beginning devoted primarily to reproductive rather than creative ends ; for every Diirer or Rembrandt , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundreds of nameless engravers and etchers who made their living copying pictures by other artists . Lithography is believed to have been perfected about 1798 , by Alois Senefelder , a Bavarian printer , who thought of his invention as a cheap way to print literary and music manuscripts . Senefelder 's method was vastly more efficient than any of the others ; it soon proved , in addition , to have enormous appeal for artists . Lithography is based on the mutual antipathy of oil and water . In the classic technique , the lithographer draws with a greasy substance on a smoothly ground block of limestone ; the stone is moistened with water , which the greasy markings reject ; then printer 's ink is applied to it , adhering to the greasy , drawn portions and being rejected by the moist , blank portions ; a sheet of paper pressed down on the surface absorbs the ink , and the result is a reversed impression of the original drawing on the stone . With subsequent ink= ings , the process can be repeated through many impressions before the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offers a great many advantages . No complicated tools or technologies must be mastered : he draws directly on the stone ( the word " lithography " comes from the Greek " lithos , " or " stone , " and " grathein , " " to write or draw " ) , using either a special lithographic crayon or an oily compound called tusche , which he appl'es with a brush . In fact , if he chooses , he can even make his drawing on lithographic transfer paper , which is then pressed down on the stone , leaving a reversed image  --  one that is re-reversed to its original state when the stone is printed . ( Whistler often used this method . ) Lithography enables the artist to achieve tones from the densest black to the most delicate shades of gray , and by using more than one stone he can employ a wide and subtle range of color . For this reason , lithography is considered the most painterly of the print techniques . The technical manipulation of the process  --  the " cookery " involved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the artist ; the etching of the artist 's design with a weak acid solution , so that it will last through multiple impressions ; the inking of the stone and the actual job of putting it through the press ; and the adjustment and alteration of the various steps until a proof has been pulled that satisfies the artist is all done by a professional printer who is a specialist . The printer has spent several years learning his trade and can often help the artist to achieve precisely the effect he is seeking . It has been so in France , at any rate , but until about 1960 it was certainly not so in this country . Lithography caught on in the United States about 1818 , mainly as a means of mass-producing book illustrations , posters , and popular decorative prints such as those turned out in great quantity by Currier &; Ives . The standing rule at Corner &; Ives was that the artist who painted the original was not allowed to touch the lithographic stone ; his work was redrawn on it by professional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the stone , and could do so in the approved , highly standardized manner . When photolithography appeared , during the eighteen-nineties , the corn me rola presses all converted as rapidly as possible to the new technique . Lithographic limestones were replaced by zinc plates and then by aluminum plates . The number of printers who could hand-pull an impression from a stone declined steadily , until by 1950 an American artist who wanted to make lithographs was obliged to print them himself , with inadequate equipment , or else go to France , where the ateliers of Mourlot , Desjobert , and other artisans maintained the tradition of fine-art lithography . IT is true that a great many non-lithographic prints were being made and sold throughout the United States during the nineteen-forties . The arrival in New York in 1940 of the English printmaker Stanley William Hayter , whose Atelier 17 , in Paris , had attracted the interest of many European artists , led Jackson Pollock , Jacques Lipchitz , Alexander Calder , and others to experiment with the intaglio techniques of etching and engraving . Leonard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ artists had rediscovered the woodcut , and a number of young artists were investigating the possibilities of silkscreen printing -- -a technique that involves the transfer of an image to a stretched square of silk , through whose fine mesh ink is forced in order to make the print . Since the image has ordinarily been transferred to the silk by a photomechanical process , silk-screen prints do not usually qualify as " original " prints  --  a classification that has been much in dispute lately but usually implies that the artist has created the master image directly on the printing surface . ( When the artist draws directly on the silk screen , the resulting print is called a serigraph . ) In any event , most of the other printmaking in America was also being done by professional printmakers rather than by major artists . Aside from brief experiments with etching made by Pollock in 1946 , none of the Abstract Expressionists had shown any interest in making prints , and not a single artist of stature in this country was making lithographs . The remarkable flowering of lithography during the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of two women , one on the East Coast and one on the West . On the West Coast , activities got started in 1958 , after June Wayne , a California artist and printmaker , stopped off in New York and had what seemed to her at the time a casual conversation with V. McNeil Lowry , the director of the Ford Foundation 's newly formed Program in the Humanities and the Arts . Miss Wayne told Lowry that she was going to Paris to make an edition of lithographs , because there was not a single printer in America who could handle the job , and she suggested that the Ford Foundation might sensibly spend some of its millions to revive the dying art . Lowry was interested . Soon after their conversation , he wrote to Miss Wayne asking whether she had any specific ideas on the subject . She did , and the result was the Tamarind Lithography Workshop , established in Los Angeles in 1960 with a grant from the foundation . A brilliantly organized teaching studio , Tamarind has exerted its influence mainly by training @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ established fine lithography studios of their own . The East Coast venture had begun in 1957 , without subsidy or plan of organization , in a modest frame house in West Islip , Long Island , occupied by Tatyana Grosman and her husband Maurice , a painter . ( Mat:rice Gros-man , who died this winter , took no active part in the lithographic operations ; he painted , rnade sculptures , played excellent chess , and took a quiet pride in his wife 's achievements . ) The workshop has expanded only slightly since then , and the number of artists who have printed there has been limited so far to seventeen . Both technically and aesthetically , however , the prints published by Tatyana Grosman 's Universal Limited Art Editions are generally acknowledged to be equal or superior to anything being done in Europe or anywhere else , and a good many of them have been recognized as works of art of a very high order . " It 's amazing how few had prints Tanya has put out , " William S. Lieberman , the director of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said the other day . " Maybe one out of twenty-five of her prints a does n't stand up as a work of art , and I do n't know of another workshop in the world of which that could be said . " Lieberman 's museum gets the first number of every edition printed by Universal Limited Art Editions  --  an arrangement that has been made possible in recent years by the help of Armand and Celeste Banos , who are themselves ardent print collectors . The museum is grateful for it , because ULAE prints have become exceedingly difficult to acquire , and when the prints of some of Mrs. Grosman 's artists change hands after the initial sale , they go for many times the original price . Mrs. Grosman does not concern herself with this form of escalation . Although her own prices have risen over the last decade  --  a print that might have cost seventy-five to a hundred dollars in 1959 now costs anywhere from four hundred to three thousand dollars she has never made much money from her operations . " Tanya is completely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Lieberman has said . " The commercial side of the operation if , indeed , there is one  --  is in-cidental . " ULAE editions are limited to the number of impressions that the printer can pull from one stone in a day 's work , and sometimes by other considerations as well . Jasper johns , one of the artists who work with Mrs. Grosman , maintains that if there were only five sheets of a particularly beautiful paper in the world , she would make an edition using just those five sheets , no matter how much money she lost on it . When one of her editions appears in a quantity that seems eccentric ? seventeen , for example , or twenty-three  --  the reason is usually that the prints issued were the only ones that met Mrs. Grosman 's exacting specifications , and she had the rest destroyed . TATYANA GROSMAN , as her first name suggests , is Russian by birth , and after more than thirty years in this country her English is still so freighted with unfamiliar ac-cents and inflections that most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seventy-one , she is a tiny , soft-spoken woman with a manner so exquisitely polite and considerate that one is tempted to apply to her the antique term " gentlewoman . " She is also , in her quiet way , implacably persistent . Mrs. Grosman spends a good deal of time on the telephone . She will often excuse herself From a lunch table or from a gathering of people in order to telephone someone in a remote part of the country or the world , and , as the late John McKendry , the curator of prints and photographs at the Metro-politan Museum , pointed out a few years ago , there is always a very spe-cific point to her call . " Whenever Tanya calls me , " McKendry said , " with all that incredible charm of hers , I know there 's a reason , and that something good will come of it , and that I 'll have several hours ' or days ' work to do as a result . " Once , McKendry and Henry Geld-zahler , the Metropolitan 's curator of twentieth-century @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house for lunch , but both of them had had colds and would have preferred not to make the train trip to West Islip . After dis-cussing the matter , though , they de-cided that it would he easier to go than to explain why they were not going . " She can be embarrassingly generous , " according to McKendry . " She has this great maternal thing  --  she takes care of her artists , makes sure they eat a lot , gives them lavish gifts , insists on paying the check in restaurants . But at the same time she expects a great deal from you  --  and you always find yourself working twice as hard for her as you would for anyone else . She 's so gentle and yet so strong  --  strong enough to be flexible where it matters . " The flexible side of Mrs. Grosman 's nature has enabled her to work more or less harmoniously with some exceptionally strong-willed artists , nearly all of whom made their first lithographs as a result of her persistent urging . The first of these was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Grosman in 1957 and has continued to make lithographs at her studio ever since . Then came  --  in chronological order  --  Fritz Glarner , Sam Francis , Grace Hartigan , Jasper Johns , Helen Frankenthaler , Robert Motherwell , Robert Rauschenberg , Jim Dine , Lee Bontecou , Barnett Newman , Marisol , James Rosenquist , Cy Twombly , Edwin Schlossberg , Claes Oldenburg , and R. Buckminster Fuller . Several other well-known artists would like very much to work with Mrs. Grosman , but she has no wish to enlarge her " family " of artists , and she has been quite firm in stipulating that her workshop is not a printing facility . The family , by and large , includes several of the most innovative and influential artists now at work in America , and this fact is often cited as a primary reason for Mrs. Grosman 's extraordinary achievement . With the exception of the work of an occasional genius like Piranesi or Callot , the great prints and the major developments in printmaking have all been the work of major artists of a period @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the artists she admires . The results , which have been extraordinary by any standards , are even more remarkable when one considers that Mrs Grosman herself , by her own frequent admission , knows surprisingly little about the craft of lithography . " Even today , I do n't know anything about lithographic techniques , " she noted quietly one recent afternoon , while sitting with a friend at the long dining table in her sunny kitchen . " The way we work is very simple  --  the artist makes his drawing on the stone , the printer makes a proof , and then the artist decides what be likes or does n't like , and makes changes , and maybe I make some suggestions , and we select the paper , and that 's how it is . " Although she does know that the process is a good deal more complicated than her explanation of it , Mrs. Grosman prefers to leave the technical details to others and to concentrate her own attention on the rather mysterious , intangible qualities of the medium . " I think what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ production , " she said . " Barnett Newman said a wonderful thing : he said that printing is like music  --  the artist is the composer , and the printer is the interpreter . And the interpretation is so important ! Here the intention has always been that whatever the printer can do in one day , that becomes the size of the edition . If he prints twenty , thirty , forty , then that 's it , and I do n't want him to continue the next day and do more , because his touch will be different , everything will change . The printer must be with the work . He is not imitating a machine , because a machine can do much better as far as speed is concerned . The printer must be with it , like music ; he knows that here is a crescendo , here a diminuendo  --  he feels it ! " Mrs. Grosman paused reflectively . " I do n't know how these things happen , really , " she continued after a moment . " You see , my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life together it was his work that interested me  --  that was my life . And then , in 1955 , when we were living in Manhattan , Maurice had a had heart attack , and I brought him out here to get well  --  we had been spending summers in this little house since 1944 -- and then the doctor told me that Maurice would never be so strong again , and I knew that I would have to do something , right away . What was I to do ? My great interest , my real passion , had always been books , books with visual images . I had just read a lovely hook that inspired me very much , a book by Monroe Wheeler called ' Modern Painters and Sculptors as Illustrators , ' in which he spoke about artists doing graphic work to illustrate books of poetry  --  Picasso and Matisse and others did that in France  --  and he said that the idea ! thing would be for an artist and a poet to work together on a hook . The idea seemed very beautiful to inc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admired  --  on silk-screen prints . Then , by pure luck , I found two fine lithographic stones in the front yard of our house  --  real 13a riarl lithographic stones , which had been discarded years and years before and were being used as part of a path . And somehow I got the idea that I could use these stones to make a book of the kind Mr. Wheeler had described . I went to see Mr. Rosset  --  Barney Rosset , of the Grove Press  --  to ask if he could perhaps suggest a poet for such a book , and he suggested Frank O'Hara . Well , I read some of O'Hara 's poems , but I did n't really understand them very well , they were so abstract . But then a few days later Maurice and I drove out to Larry Rivers ' studio , in Southampton . Larry had also been a friend for some time . I talked to Larry about this idea of a book that would be a real fusion of poetry and art  --  a real collaboration , not just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then he called out , ' Hey , Frank ! ' And down the stairs came a young man in bluejeans . It was Frank O'Hara . And that is how things have happened to me in my life . They have just worked out , somehow . " ALTHOUGH Mrs. Grosman rarely thinks about the past these days , she does retain a few vivid memories of her childhood . She was born in Ekaterinburg ( today it is called Sverdlovsk ) , in the Urals  --  the city where Czar Nicholas II and his family were imprisoned and then executed by the Bolsheviks in 1918 . Tatyana was fourteen at the time . She remembers her father , Semion Michailovitch Aguschewitsch , who was the owner and publisher of Lira Life , the leading paper in that area , bringing home a proof of the next day 's front page , with its headline on the execution . While the family were at dinner , the doorbell rang , and the maid announced that two officials of the Ekaterinburg Soviet wanted to see Mr. Aguschewitsch . He received them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about fifteen minutes later . After telling his wife and children to say nothing about the royal family 's deaths , he went back to his office and remade the paper , which had not yet been distributed , substituting an edition that made no mention of the shootings . They were only reported in the paper two weeks later . Up until 1918 , not much had happened to disturb the comfort of this well-to-do family . Tatyana 's father had come out to Ekaterinburg around 1900 to found the paper , and its success and his were a reflection of the city 's growth as an important mining and industrial center in the early years of the century . Ural Life was read in Moscow and St. Petersburg and throughout Siberia ; like the newly completed Trans-Siberian Railroad , it served as a link between western , European Russia and the vast eastern region that stretched from the Urals to China and the Pacific . The paper had a regular literary page , with occasional contributions by political exiles in Siberia , writing under pseudonyms . Aguschewitsch himself was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and astute businessman , who invested his money in real estate . As a result , Tatyana and a younger brother grew up in an atmosphere of modest wealth and liberal culture . Nearly every summer , the family went to visit grandparents in Munich . Tatyana rather enjoyed the trip , which used to take thirteen days by train  --  later it was reduced to six  --  but she would have preferred to spend her summers in some Russian village with friends . Mrs. Aguschewitsch 's family had emigrated from Russia to Bavaria in the nineteenth century , and , according to Tatyana , her mother , who had grown up in Germany , never really became used to living in the Urals . " My mother was somewhat eccentric , " she recalls . " She was full of energy and was very gifted . She spoke several languages with ease , played the piano , and was always travelling , always doing things . I admired her , but I felt that I could never he such a person as she was . When I think about it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very inward child  --  that I had nowhere to grow but inside . I was reading very much , always . The theory in our house was that a child must read only good literature , whether or not he understood it , and in Russia even the children 's hooks were mostly excerpts from the major authors  --  Turgenev and Dostoevski and Nekrassov and , of course , Pushkin . The visits to Western Europe every summer were a torture for me , but still those days on the train were a time when I could be alone with my hooks and the passing landscape . The theatre also played a great part in my imagination . I think my exact , precise first memory was of going to the theatre , to see a play by Gaga My father loved the theatre , and he had two permanent seats , for every performance . There was one theatre in the town , and it presented opera half the year and drama the other half . The most important companies from Moscow and St. Petersburg came . Ekaterinburg was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and was growing rapidly , I remember Father was always building extensions to his printing plant . " The Aguschewitsch children and their mother spent the summer of 1914 in Berchtesgad.en . When the war broke out , that August , they went first to Switzerland , where the Russian consulate arranged for them and a group of other displaced Russians to travel by ship across the Black Sea to Odessa . Back home in Ekaterinburg , a thousand miles from the fighting fronts , they were scarcely aware of the devastation going on in western Russia and in Europe . They spent the summer of 1916 in the Siberian village of Krutikha , on the edge of the taiga . The following summer , while Alexander Kerenski 's provisional government sought ineffectually to cope with the revolutionary chaos following Nicholas II 's abdication and Russia 's withdrawal from the war , the family took a leisurely boat trip down the Volga from Kazan to the Caucasus and the spas of Kislovodsk and Essentuki , " I was enchanted , " Tatyana recalls . " Everything reminded me of Lermontov @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I read Tolstoy 's ' War and Peace ' for the first time  --  an encounter that has stayed with me to this day . Actually , the Revolution was relatively peaceful for us until 191 8 . " After the October Revolution brought the Bolsheviks to power , in the fall of 1917 , local groups of Bolshevik workers and soldiers seized control of most of the leading towns and cities , including Ekaterinburg. but Aguschewitsch continued to put out his paper , the children continued to go to school , and life was much as it had been . Then , in the summer of 1918 , the counter-revolutionary White Army of Admiral Alexander Vasilievich Kolchak joined forces with several regiments of Czechoslovak troops who had deserted to Russia early in the war , had been sent to Siberia , and were now trying to fight their way home again , and they drove close enough to threaten Ekaterinburg . It was at this time that the Ekaterinburg Soviet , Fearing that the advancing Whites would liberate the Czar , sentenced him and his family to death . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , the tide of battle turned and the Red Army advanced on the city . Aguschewitsch and his family , though they had survived thus far without serious hardship , now decided to leave Ekaterinburg temporarily . Accompanied by several trunks full of belongings and by one of their maids , they took the Trans-Siberian Railroad east to Vladivostok , which was still in White Russian hands . After a stay of several months , they went on to Japan , where they lived in the European section of Yokohama for about ten months . " We did not feel that we were emigrating , " Tatyana recalls . " We were just going to wait until things had settled down at home , and Japan was the nearest country . My parents engaged a Russian tutor for me , so that I would not get behind in school , and I also attended the Sacred Heart Convent school in Tokyo . But eventually my parents realized that they had to make a. decision . Russia was not settling down , it seemed . We could not go back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first idea was to go to Switzerland , where the children would have good schools . But for Switzerland , and also for America , there was too long a wait for visas . Somehow , we were able to get a transit visa to Italy , and so we sailed for Venice  --  the whole family and Maria , the maid . I remember that the ship visited many ports for long stays and we went sightseeing . The trip took fifty-eight days . " FROM Venice the Aguschewitsch family went to visit Mrs. Aguschewitsch 's relatives inNiunich , and shortly thereafter they moved to Dresden . They still hoped to go eventually to Switzerland , but Mr. Aguschewitsch managed to find a comfortable house in Dresden and soon began investing in other properties , so they settled there instead . Tatyana spent the next eight years in Dresden , and they were lonely ones for her . Although she spoke fluent German , she felt like an outsider at her school , a German lyceum . " Germany at that time , after the First World War , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well in his work , " Tatyana recalls . " The family always went to the mountains at Christmastime , and in the spring my mother and I went to the Czechoslovakian spas or to Prague , Vienna , or Paris . The summers we spent at North Sea resorts or in Italy . As you can see , I was a very devoted daughter , and I accompanied my mother everywhere , doing everything a young lady is supposed to do . But there were very few people I could relate to , and I spent a great deal of time reading . " For a period after her graduation from the lyceum , she did nothing , but then , more to secure her independence than for any other reason , she enrolled in the Dresden Academy of Applied Arts , and through friends there she met Maurice Grosman , a young student from the nearby Academy of Fine Arts . Grosman had been born in Poland , but he had lived most of his life in Germany . He was a free spirit , attractive , and poor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ although he had started to make a name for himself and already had pictures hanging in several museums , Tatyana 's parents did not approve of the friendship . When the inevitable crisis occurred , Tatyana went off by herself to the Alpine skiing village of Lech , where she decided , after much thought , that she would have to break with her family . It was a painful decision . Soon after making it , she be , came seriously ill , and had to spend two months in the hospital . When she recovered , early in 1931 , she and Grosman were married . They went to Paris , settling first in the lit-tle suburban town of Herblay , on the Seine , where a daugh-ter , Larissa , was born in 1933 . Even-tually , they moved to a tiny apartment in Montparnasse . Their friends were foreign artists and writers -- men like Jacques Lipchitz , Chaim Soutine , and Ossip ladkine  --  who had been drawn to Paris for the usual reasons . Gen-erally speaking , the Grosmans had little contact with the White Russian exile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kind of passionate nostalgia that afflicts so many exiles from prerevolutionary Russia . Today , she rarely thinks about the country of her birth , and her memories of it tend to come mainly from the books that she read as a child . ) They lived on Maurice 's meagre earnings as an artist , supplemented by a small allowance from Tatyana 's father . Although Maurice was receiving some recogni-tion , and had been given a one-man show at the Vignon Gallery , life be-came increasingly difficult for them . Often , there was barely enough money For food . Mrs. Grosman can still hardly bring herself to speak of the tragedy that engulfed them at this time . " Larissa was a beautiful child , " she once confided to a friend . " She gave me the greatest moments of happiness in my life . One day , she became suddenly and inexplicably ill . We took her to the hospital , and she died there the following day . She was sixteen months old . " TN the Siberia of her childhood , Mrs. Grosman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often had occasion to recall these stories during the years between 1940 and 1943 , when she and her husband lived in daily fear of being apprehended , because they were Jewish . Two days before Paris fell , they left the city with the exodus . They were invited by their concierge to join her and some of her women friends and their eleven children in an ancient truck driven by a young boy . After three weeks on the road , with frequent bombing and strafing attacks by German planes , they reached the tiny village of Ceret , in the Pyrenees , where the Grosmans lived for the next year . Ceret , which had been something of an artists ' colony before the war , and where they had spent several summers , for a while seemed a fairly secure refuge . As time passed and the Nazi policy toward yews became clearer , however , unoccupied France began to seem less and less safe . In the hope of getting a visa to the United States , the Gros-mans moved in 194-1 down to Marseilles . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrested several thousand Jews . Maurice was among them . Instead of being shipped to one of the dreaded camps , Grosman had the good fortune to be sent to a residence assigmie  --  a sort of limited detention  --  in the village of Alzon , above Nimes . Tatyana joined him there . The following spring , a letter came from the American consulate in Marseilles saying that their visa had been approved and that they should present themselves for immigration . In order to leave Alzon , Grosman had to have a permit signed by officials in all the towns between Alzon and Marseilles . Obviously , it would take weeks to get the necessary signatures by mail , so Tatyana took the permit to each official in person , got all the necessary signatures , and brought it back within a few days . The permit was valid for fourteen days . Maurice and Tatyana hoped that on receiving the visa they could leave aboard the ship Nyassa , which was then anchored in Marseilles Har bor . But the American consulate now informed them that another document @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had ever been convicted of a crime . Frantic letters to Paris elicited a police statement clearing Maurice , but a similar clearance for Tatyana was delayed . When it finally did arrive , the Nyassa had sailed and Maurice 's fourteen-day permit had expired . A friendly policeman told them that the only way to get the permit extended was for Maurice to be hospitalized , and so , in desperation , they went around to all the hospitals they could find , trying to have him admitted . A private sanitarium for the insane , near Marseilles , finally took him in , for the logical reason that he appeared to he " nervous . " Tatyana returned to their lodgings , a small room in a cheap Marseilles hotel , and they waited . One night , the police came to the hotel and knocked at the entrance . She went to the roof and hid behind the chimney of an adjacent building while they searched the premises . Hearing them leave , she crept back inside , but as she started to get dressed she heard another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clung to the roof , then jumped to a balcony of the next house , and hid in the bedroom of a terrified teen-age girl until morning . The next day , Tatyana learned of an announcement that had come over British radio the night before : All Jews in France were to be arrested . She left her belongings in her room upstairs , asked the hotel 's owner to tell the police that she would be back , and went to Maurice 's sanitarium , where she spent the next few weeks hiding under his bedclothes every night and slipping out to be the " first visitor " every morning . A woman patient was deeply impressed by her devotion . " ilh , quelle femme ! " she would sigh every time she saw the Grosmans together . Then , one morning , a Sirrete official came to the sanitarium to arrest Maurice . The doctor in charge succeeded in stalling him off , and the Grosmans fled . After several weeks of hiding nut in the dwellings of various friends , they managed to procure false identity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ official  --  a man they had known in Ceret before the war  --  they made their way to a small town in the Pyrenees , not far from Ceret , called Le Boulou , where they arrived in November of 1942 . Le Boulou was very close to the Spanish border . A local resident gave them rough directions for crossing the mountains . They set out at noon the following day , on the theory that the border guards would he having their lunch at that hour . To make their intentions appear innocent , Maurice carried his easel and paintbox , and Tatyana wore her fur coat . They had no other possessions with them . They climbed into the mountains , crossed the border before nightfall , and spent the night in a Spanish farmer 's cottage . Before starting out the next morning , Tatyana insisted on hiding all their false identification papers in the beams of the barn ; the only document they did not destroy was a copyist 's permit that had been issued and stamped by the French Ministry of Fine Arts four years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Louvre while they lived in Paris . Then they started walking toward Barcelona . The trip took three weeks , and along the way Mrs. Grosman was reminded vividly , over and over , of stories she had heard as a child . The forests of Catalonia seemed as familiar to her as the cedar forests of Siberia , bringing all the old Russian tales of escape and miraculous survival freshly to her mind . Only once were they stopped  --  by a Guardia Civil officer , who asked to look at their papers . Maurice , who had seen him approaching in time to get out his sketch pad and begin drawing a tree , held up his copyist 's permit , and the ministerial seal satisfied the officer 's curiosity . " All during that walk through Spain , I was absolutely so ha/1y , " Tatyana recalls . " I was never afraid , and I felt free . Somehow , we just discovered what we needed ; we found food to eat and places to sleep . Later , in Barcelona , when we were finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society ( HIAS ) helped them to get visas and transportation to Lisbon and from there to the United States , which they reached in the summer of 1943 , Landing at Philadelphia and going directly to New York . The HIAS authorities here told them that Maurice would have to work in a factory , but Tatyana scolded them so severely  --  artists were in too short supply and their training too valuable to be thus ignored , she said  --  that they said he could do as he pleased . With the help of Ossip Zadkine , who had preceded them to New York , the Grosmans found a small studio apartment on Eighth Street . They had 110 money at all . Maurice supplemented the income he got from selling his paintings by giving private lessons in drawing and painting at the studio . He also taught himself the technique of silk-screen printing , and used it to make copies of modern paintings , which were sold by the Marhoro Book Shops . They lived quietly and inexpensively , on the fringes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the vital center of new energies and a new style in art . People who knew the Grosmans during the nineteen-forties and the early fifties remember Tatyana as being very much in the background . Maurice was the center of the household ; his work and his ebullient personality were the predominant elements . All this changed abruptly after Maurice 's heart attack in 1955 , although in retrospect it could be seen that the strength and resilience that Tatyana then showed had been there all along . Her first step was to get rid of the Eighth Street studio and move Maurice out to the clearer air of West Islip . The house they lived in there was one they had rented for a number of summers and then , in 1949 , had scraped up enough money to buy . Now the problem was how to develop enough income to stay there . It was at this point that Tatyana decided to go into business as an independent publisher of silk-screen reproductions . Her editions would be small and of the highest quality , and , most important , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actively with Maurice in the reproduction process  --  to supervise the matching of colors , the choice of paper , and all other details . The first artist she approached was Mary Callery , the sculptor , whom she had met once at the Curt Valentin Gallery , and who happened to live in nearby Huntington . Maly Cutlery readily agreed to the idea . She made a drawing for Maurice to reproduce on a screen , and she came over regularly to West Islip to discuss and correct the work . Tatyana was so grateful that she decided the edition must be printed on a special paper , handmade for the purpose , and her search for someone qualified to do the job led her to Douglass Howell , in Westbury . Howell , who specializes in handmade papers , produced a beautiful run of paper in which each sheet was slightly darker than the last , so that the series started white and ended brown . Mary Callery was delighted with the final edition , of twenty-eight prints  --  a minuscule production , by most commercial standards . Mrs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the prints to New York and showed them to Wil liam Lieberman . Lieberman asked whether Mary Callery had actually done the drawing on the silk screen , and when Mrs. Grosman said she had not , he said , " Why did you tell me Now I ca n't buy it  --  it 's not an original . " Only slightly daunted , Mrs. Gros-man managed to sell most of the prints in this initial venture to friends or commercial establishments . Another silk screen done by Maurice from a drawing by Mary Callery turned out equally well , and it was followed by reproductions of works by Max Weber and by the Grosmans ' old friend Jacques Lipchirz . Mrs. Gros-man next paid a call on Carl Zigrosser , the greatly respected curator of prints at the Philadelphia Museum of Art . Zigrosser was impressed by the quality of the work , and said so . He also suggested that Maurice himself sign the prints , since they were in effect his original work after Callery , Weber , and Lipchitz . Maurice , who did not believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refused . Tatyana was nevertheless so buoyed by Zigrossees encouragement that she returned to West Islip determined to put the venture on a fully professional basis , under the somewhat grandiloquent title  --  chosen some time previously  --  of Universal Limited Art Editions , JUST about this time , in the spring of 1957 , Mrs. Grosman discovered that she had two lithographic limestones in her front yard . Limestone with the strength and surface texture suitable for fine lithographic work is extremely rare . In fact , all of it comes from the Bavarian quarries where Senefelder got his original stones . Commercial lithographers in this country sometimes experimented with Texas , Indiana , and Vermont limestones , but for subtlety and precision of tone nothing has ever been found to compare with the Bavarian stones , whose smooth , soft texture gives an artist the feeling that his crayon or brush is gliding on a film of air . Since the quarries in which the Bavarian stones were found are now exhausted , artist-lithographers in recent years have had to reclaim hundreds of old stones that were discarded by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Each stone can be used over and over  --  the grinding process that effaces the previous image removes only a very thin layer  --  but eventually the stone does wear out , and unless some new source of lithographic limestone is . found , future lithographers will have to make their drawings on zinc or aluminum plates , or some other substitute . The two stones that Mrs. Grosman found in her front yard were small but excellent examples  --  about fourteen inches square by four inches thick . " William Lieberman and Carl ' Li-grosser had made me realize the difference between work made without the artist 's collaboration and original prints , in which the artist himself participates , " Mrs. Grosman said . " After that , I knew I wanted to make originals , and the fact was I did n't much like silk screens did n't like the smell or some-thing . What I really wanted was for the artist to work with his hand on a surface , and , by some miracle , here were the two stones . " By another coincidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ask the Grosmans to sign a petition having to do with bathing rights at the local beach . The four got to talking , and it turned out that the neighbors were commercial silk-screen printers , ton , and that they had an old flatbed lithography press that they were not using . The Grosmans signed the petition ; they also bought the press , for fifteen dollars . A few days later , Tatyana Grosman took her two stones out to Larry Rivers ' studio in Southampton , and her real work began . " Stones , " the work consisting of lithographs and poems that Larry Rivers and Frank O'Hara started to work on in 1957 , was not published until 1959 . Rivers and O'Hara had completed their work on the stones long before that , but Mrs. Grosman wanted to have a special paper made for the edition , and the paper she chose was so difficult to make that Douglass Howell could turn out only a few sheets a day ? " if it did n't rain . " The choice of paper has always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father 's going to Finland to buy good-quality paper stock , and who now buys papers from special sources in France , Switzerland , Italy , and Japan . She tends to think of the paper for an edition in much the same way that a sculptor thinks of stone or wood  --  as the material for the creation of works of art . And from the outset of her printing operations Mrs. Grosman has wanted to print nothing but works of art . " Stones " itself , which started out to he a book , became in the end a portfolio of twelve loose prints , the first number of which was purchased by the Museum of Modern Art . Twenty-five portfolios were printed , and they came , as Mrs. Grosman 's editions usually do , in an elaborate and costly folder . The paper for " Stones " was made from linen rag cuttings and the paper for the folder was made from blue denim . " The first time I saw Frank , he was in bluejeans , " Mrs. Grosman explained . " Most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uniform  --  and so I asked Mr. Howell could he do something with bluejeans , and he tried , and did it . " While Rivers was waiting for O'Hara to work with him on " Stones , " he executed several more lithographs , which appeared as individual editions . " He was eager to experiment , and his impatience really got me started in single editions , " Mrs. Grosman says . " Until then , I had been thinking only of hooks . " Although he chafed at the extremely slow pace of hand printing , Rivers found that he liked the medium , and he greatly enjoyed trying to shock " this Siberian lady Tanya , " who , as he later wrote in an essay on the experience , " had dedicated herself with a gentle fury to the production of lithographs . " These first Rivers prints were put through the fifteen-dollar flatbed press by Robert Blackburn , a lithographer who had his own commercial studio in New York , and whom Mrs. Grosman , with her usual persuasiveness , had induced to come nut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the printing was done in the living room there ; later , they bought a somewhat larger secondhand press and moved their operation into the garage . N.Vhen a print came up to everyone 's expectations , Mrs. Grosman showed it to a few carefully selected people  --  Lie berrnan ; Zigrosse r ; Una Johnson , at the Brooklyn Museum ; Adelyn Breeskin , at the Baltimore Museum ; Jacob Kainen , at the Smithsonian . " These people have been my teachers , " she says . " Also John B. Myers , at the Tibor de Nagy Gallery , and , later , Leo Castelli have been unfailingly helpful . " Eventually , for reasons of her own , she sometimes decided to launch a new edition in Boston or Philadelphia , or even in Detroit . She had no trouble at all placing her prints or finding buyers for them ; her primary concern , always , was to place them where they would be properly understood and appreciated . In 1958 , Mrs. Grosman invited a second artist , Fritz Glarner , to make an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Callery 's , and Mrs. Grosman liked his abstract , Mondrian-influenced paintings . " I thought it might be an interesting counterbalance to Larry to invite an artist who was very pure and very calm , " she said . " Glarner happened to live near Mary Callery , in Huntington , so I took him some stones . Mr. Blackburn had told me where to buy more lithographic stones , so I had several by this time . It 's funny --  -- when Max Weber heard that we were doing lithographs , he told me , ' You must invite young artists , so they can carry those heavy stones . ' " Even the smallest stone weighed about forty pounds ; Mrs. Grosman always had to recruit a strong assistant to transport them . Following her own instinct and choosing artists whose work appealed to her , she took stones the following year to Sam Francis , a peripatetic abstract artist ( he went to Japan before finishing his work on the stones , and Mrs. Grosman kept them inviolate until he returned , nine years later , and finished ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the second generation of Abstract Expressionists . Since 1958 , Mrs. Grosman had been following with great interest the work of Jasper Johns and Robert Rauschenberg , two young painters whose use of objects and images from everyday life was to be of such crucial importance for the new , post-Abstract Expressionist generation . " I really wanted to invite Rauschenberg first , " she recalls , " but I was a little afraid that I might not he strong enough , that he would he too disruptive . And then I saw Jasper Johns ' target painting at the Museum of Modern Art , and I wrote to him a letter , and he answered  --  a card  --  saying that he was in South Carolina but that he would come out when he returned . And one day he did . He came with his little animal  --  I must not call it a monkey  --  which he put in the catalpa tree in the yard . " ( The animal was a kinkajou . ) Johns and Rauschenberg then had studios in the same loft building , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ district . When Mrs. Grosman took three large stones there for Johns to work on , Johns got Rauschenberg to help carry them upstairs ; the stones were so heavy that they had to enlist the additional aid of a passing derelict , who provided it for wine money . Rauschenberg was fascinated by the archaism of the whole idea  --  that in the middle of the twentieth century anyone should he " drawing on rocks . " The backbreaking labor of getting the stones upstairs made Johns decide that he would never again work on them in his own studio , and from then on he , like Mrs. Grosman 's other artists , went out to West Islip to make his prints . AGOOD many people today consider Johns the most important printmaker of our time . His graphic work is in great demand  --  both the Philadelphia Museum of Art and the Museum of Modern Art devoted one-man shows to it in 1970 ? and the prices now paid for his prints are well beyond the reach of most collectors . Johns , a highly enigmatic artist , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing about the process , he wanted to see how much he could complicate it . His first lithographic project , started in 1960 but not completed until 1963 ( it took Mrs. Gros-man three years to find the right paper ) , was a series of thirty lithographs portraying the Arabic numerals zero through nine . Each print in this series is , in a sense , a portrait of one of the numerals , all ten of which appear in a double line at the top of the print . The series is repeated three times  --  in black ink on off-white paper , in gray ink on unbleached paper , and in colors on white paper , making thirty different prints in all  --  and Johns was able to complicate it very successfully by deciding that the entire series be printed from one stone . Taking the zero first , he saw it through its three separate printings , then altered the image and redrew , on the same surface , the figure one ; in that print and thereafter , however , Johns took care not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ numeral bears traces of the one preceding . The table of small numhersabove the main image also underwent constant transformations throughout the series . As a result of Johns ' incredibly skillful drawing and the transparency of the lithographic inks , the series is not only a bravura demonstration of the possibilities of the medium but a subtle essay on change , seen in the visual symbols of change . By the time Mrs. Grosman had ordered the right paper to print " 0-9 , " Johns had made several other individual prints , and ULAE had acquired a new printer  --  a young man named Zigmunds Priede , who succeeded Robert Blackburn . Priede , Blackburn 's former assistant , proved to be a wonderfully sensitive and resourceful printer , and as much of a perfectionist as Tatyana Grosman . Working very closely with Johns , who came out from New York to stay at the Grosmans ' house , he was able to solve the difficult tech-. - nical problems of " 0-9 " and to pull impressions whose delicacy of tone revealed every nuance of Johns ' drawing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ First , the zero , very classic , in black ink on off-white paper , and then printed in gray on the unbleached paper  --  very mysterious and moody  --  and then once again , very luminously printed in yellow on pure white , like sunshine ? And after that came the metamorphosis to the number one , but you could still see the zero through the one , What a discovery  --  that the same stone could have so many moods ! And that is what fascinates me to work with Jasper . His subjects are so familiar  --  flags , targets , numbers , alphabets . Everything is so known . But it is so unexpected each time . In lithography , on stone , or in etching  --  in etching with aquatint  --  or on the band-fed offset press , he is really playing each medium as an instrument , and the subjects become different personalities . Zigmunds Priede said about working with Jasper that he had the overwhelming feeling of being present while great art was being created . " Johns has made more than a hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out that he is going to make a new print , Mrs. Gros-man is besieged with orders for it , most of which can not be filled , because the ULAE editions remain quite small ; there were ten impressions of each of the " 0-9 " series . Johns ' 1964 " Ale Cans , " a lithograph whose glossy , lustrous blacks , subtle gold and green tones , and uncanny three-dimensionality have made it probably the most coveted of modern prints , came out in an edition of thirty-one , which Mrs. Grosman sold originally for a hundred and seventy-five dollars apiece . The fact that a print of " Ale Cans " was resold recently for ten thousand dollars came as no particular surprise to Mrs. Grosman ; she herself has always referred privately to this print as " Peter and Paul , " because from the moment she saw it the image ( of two rather meticulously rendered cans of Ballantine 's Ale ) struck her as a miraculous modern icon . According . to Johns , Mrs. Grosman decided very early in her printing career @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible , and nothing has happened since to change her mind . This insistence on preEminent quality creates certain problems . " Everything that happens out there happens awfully slowly , " Johns has said . " When something does n't come out just right , for example , Tanya gets upset and has to figure out why . It may be that if the same process is repeated it will come out fine the second time , but she ca n't accept that  --  she has to know . Sometimes , when there are two ways of doing something , I will ask her which one costs more . Tanya wo n't tell me  --  she 'll say that that 's for her to worry about . Usually , I do n't care which way we do it , and knowing about the cost would help me to decide , but she wo n't have that . Also , she 's terrifically secretive . One day when I was working out there , she took a bunch of prints in to New York to show to Bill Lieberman at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the afternoon , I asked how it had gone , and she said that Lieberman had been called into a meeting just before she arrived , and so she had turned around and brought the portfolio back home . She would n't dream of leaving her prints with somebody 's secretary ! There are times out there when it takes weeks before you can see the results of some decision you 've made , and by then you may have decided otherwise . All Tanya 's prints show the effects of this kind of slowness , this deliberation . They 're more dense , maybe . Somehow , everything that conies out of there gets stamped with her personality . " By 1962 , Mrs. Grosman felt strong enough to invite Robert Rauschenberg to her studio . " Tanya called me so often that I figured the only way I could stop her was to go out there , " Rauschenberg has explained . He immediately fell in love with the lithographic process . " It 's such a paradox , " he said recently . " The stone is so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same time it 's the most flexible , responsive surface there is . And every stone is different . Some stones will be much better for me than others  --  easier to work with . It 's like you 're drawing on the skin of the stone . " Where Johns had been interested in complicating the process , Rauschenberg had taken a wholly experimental approach to it . In all his work , Rauschenberg likes to feel that he is " collaborating " with materials rather than using them to carry out some preconceived notion of his own . The collaborative aspects of lithography , the interdependence of artist and printer , appealed to him very much , but he also wanted to explore the medium , and try all kinds of methods and materials that had not been used by anyone else . He tried pressing leaves from trees , magazine pages , and various other objects down on the stone to see whether they contained enough natural oil to leave an imprint that would hold ink ; some did and some did not . He went to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of old news photographs , which he then dipped in the greasy lithographic tusche and used to create images on the stone . By such means , he was able to adapt his collage technique in painting to lithography , and to make prints that were direct visual reports on the contemporary world . While one of these early Rauschenberg stones was being put through the press for its first proofing , it cracked in half  --  a fairly rare but not unprecedented occurrence in hand printing . Rauschenberg re-created the images on another stone , which also cracked ( it turned out that a small piece of cardboard lodged under the roller was causing uneven pressure on the stone ) , whereupon Rauschenberg told Robert Blackburn , who was still doing the printing then , to go ahead and print the edition anyway , using the cracked stone . Blackburn was incredulous  --  such a thing had never been done . Taking some of the chips of stone that had fallen from the break , Rauschenberg dipped them in tusche and applied them around the edges of the crack . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' , to print from the broken stone , The result was one of the roust striking prints ULAE has published a collage of images that seem somehow to be unified , rather than separated , by the jagged fissure running down the middle . Twenty-nine impressions were made of this lithograph , which Rauschenberg , logically , decided to call " Accident , " and everybody who owns one considers himself extremely fortunate . Rauschenberg points out that Mrs. Grosman , in spite of her dedication to the classic methods of lithography , has been willing to go along with all his experiments , and has given him and her other artists complete freedom to satisfy their curiosity about the medium . For her part , Mrs. Grosman is enormously fond of Rauschenberg , whom she treats like an especially gifted son . " Bob is always bringing something new , some new discovery , " she has said . " Like the ' book ' he did , called ' Shades , ' which is a series of lithographs on Plexiglas . Nobody had ever heard of printing on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we did , and it worked . And those photosensitive stones that he and Zigmunds Priede and Bill Goldston , Zigmunds ' apprentice , did in 1969 . Together , they worked out the chemistry , the technique of somehow coating the stone with photographic emulsion and using night as a darkroom  --  I do n't know how it was done . Afterward , Goldston said , ' You know , Bob , it worked , but we do n't know why it worked , or why sometimes it does n't work . ' With Rauschenberg , there is always a conquest , a subduing of something , the conquering of something unprecedented and unexpected  --  and he utilizes it all . " THE instinct for complexity and experimentation led both johns and Rauschenberg to make prints at the Gemini G.E.L . workshop in Los Angeles , a much bigger and better-equipped establishment than that of tuaik.E . Founded in 1965 by Kenneth Tyler , a former technical director of Tune Wayne 's Tamarind workshop , Gemini has chosen to concentrate , as . Mrs. Grosman has , on graphic work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his way to accommodate these artists ' technical needs , installing presses capable of handling very large stones , for example , and developing the means to produce three-dimensional objects in multiple " editions . " The revival of interest in printmaking has taken a highly technological turn in the last few years , and many artists are now experimenting with aluminum , mylar , polyurethane , vinyl , and other plastics to produce what , for want of a more precise term , are still being referred to as prints . The results , for the most part , tend to be more novel than aesthetic , At Gemini , however , Johns , Rauschenberg , Frank Stella , Oars Oldenburg , and others have made prints of exceptional quality ; and , because the Gemini editions until recently were large ( seventy-five was a common printing there ) , and because the international market for contemporary artist prints continues to grow , some artists have profited rather handsomely . Tyler himself left Gemini two years ago , came East , and established another workshop , Tyler Graphics Ltd. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fine-art printing workshops keeps multiplying , meanwhile , and a few artists , including Rauschenberg , have even set up printing facilities in their own studios . In view of Tatyana Grosman 's personal and somewhat possessive feelings toward the artists in her family , it is hardly surprising that she has mixed emotions about their work at Gemini and elsewhere . " It was a kind of sadness on both sides , " she said not long ago . " For the artists and for me . But it is like a mother with children  --  the time comes when she has to send them nut . And when they come back they are different  --  their vocabulary is different , and they have had different experiences . And I learn from their experiences . " Whatever Mrs. Grosman may have learned in this manner has not induced her to change her methods or her approach . In 1966 , she received a fifteen-thousand-dollar grant from the National Endowment for the Arts , which she used to buy an etching press and to build an addition to the garage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ printer Donn Steward , several artists , among them Johns , Marisol , Helen Frankenthaler , Lee Bontecou , and Robert Motherwell , have achieved etchings comparable in quality to their lithographic work . Motherwell 's " A La Pintura , " a loose-leaf portfolio of twenty-two aquatints together with passages from Rafael Alberti 's poem in homage to the art of painting , became the first contemporary book to be exhibited at the Metropolitan Museum of Art , in 1972 . The project took four years to complete , and John McKendry has said that if all Motherwell 's paintings and other works were destroyed , this ! lyre de luxe alone would secure his reputation . In 1970 , ULAE acquired a lithographic offset press of a type used commercially for proofing color separations . The idea was that this would be used to print unlimited editions of work done at ULAE , in such forms as replicas , reproductions , books , and postcards  --  always with the advice of the artists concerned , so that the spirit of the original would he maintained . A new imprint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offset press . In six years , however , Telamon has produced Eve posters by artists ( the first was Rauschenberg 's " Centennial Certificate , " done on the occasion of the Metropolitan Museum 's one-hundredth birthday , in 1970 ) , and not much else . Bill Goldston , who is now the studio manager at L'LAE , and James Smith , Telamon 's offset lithographer , have spent a great deal of time during this period experimenting with the new press and evolving methods by which it can be made to re-create , step by step , the laborious process of stone printing . Jasper Johns wanted to try running a hand-drawn plate through the offset press , which is designed to take photographic plates . The printer said that it had never been done , but he would try ; the result was " Decoy I " and " Decoy II , " two of Johns ' most complex and beautiful prints . Other ULAE artists have since used the offset press to make limited editions , the most spectacular of which so far is James Rosenquist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that measures three and a half feet by six and a half feet , and required twenty-nine separate plates . In effect , Goldston and Smith have converted a mechanical technique into an extremely sensitive hand process . More and more , though , Mrs. Grosman 's thoughts have returned to what John McKendry once called her " unrelenting and unreasonable love of illustrated books . " " Always , from the beginning , my idea was books , " she says . " I let the artists do single editions , because that was what they wanted , but for me the book was always the primary goal . " Telamon Editions may bring this goal within reach . Several book projects are under way there , the first of which is a recreation of all Jasper Johns ' work at LAE , in three volumes . Johns is supervising every step in the production  --  determining the size of each print , correcting color and tone  --  and in many cases is spending more time on the photo-offset process than he did on the original print . Telamon is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Larry Rivers and Frank O'Hara on " Stones , " and it will eventually print offset editions of other hooks now in progress at ULAEnotably a collaboration of lithographs by Rauschenberg and writings by the French novelist Alain Robbe-Grillet , and a hook of lithographs , not yet titled , that was recently undertaken by the century 's protean , all-purpose genius R. Buckminster Fuller . " The Donkey and the Darling , " a fairy tale by Terry Southern with visual images by Larry Rivers , is about to be released . Mrs. Grosman works on , with her adopted family , which has changed very little in recent years . Bill Goldston oversees operations both at ULAE and at Telamon , The present printer is John Lund . An art student named Glenn Lee is entrusted with keeping the prints in pristine condition . Tony Towle , a young New York poet who has developed a thorough aesthetic and statistical knowledge of every print produced by E7LAE , shares the administrative burden with Mrs. Grosman . Since 1968 , only two new artists have been invited to the West @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't really know the younger ones , " Mrs. Grosman explains . " And I also feel a certain obligation to continue working with those we know so well . I 'll tell you something : I think artists are great people . I had a slight little disappointment once with an artist  --  a very slight disappointment  --  hut that 's all . For me , the pleasure is in being able to help an artist achieve something unique . Take , for example , Jasper , working on some very complex print , such as ' False Start II , ' each print requiring fourteen different impressions , from eleven stones , and all in varying shades of gray  --  play ing with the image , seeing it change , building it up layer by layer  --  only Jasper can do that . Or Larry Rivers , entirely the opposite , touching many interesting things without developing them , very emotional . Or Rauschen be rg , al ways bringing something new , some discovery . " For me , graphics is neither a means of supplying art to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hut , rather , the creative expression of an artist through lithographic stones or plates . I do have great love for the lithographic stone itself , for the majesty of the natural element . No two stones are alike , you see ; each one has its own size , shape , color , and texture . But the technical aspect of printing is not really important to me , and ' technique ' should never be the predominant feeling in a print . What matters is that the print be alive , with the heartbeat of the artist in it . And always between the idea and the execution of a print there is ? something , I do n't know what . Maybe I ask a question , and the artist thinks about the question , and it leads to other thinking . Sometimes , you see , the artist himself does not realize that between putting a mark on paper and printing is a difference . Putting on paper is like writing a letter to a friend . But if you publish a print , an edition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world , to he distributed so many different ways , that is something else . It must not he rushed . Sometimes it is good just to let an edition sit for a while , and maybe you will later add something or take something away . I think it is my responsibility that the artist should not ever have reason to regret what he has done . "
