When Financial Impresario O. Roy Chalk purchased the D.C. Transit System in 1956 , streetcars still rumbled through the nation 's capital , passengers sweltered or froze in antiquated buses and the books were in chaos . Chalk promised a new deal , then set about proving that he was as adept at running an essential public service into the ground as the man he bought it from , Wheeler-Dealer Louis Wolfson . Things did get better for a time before they got worse , but today Washington 's transit system is a shambles , threatened with financial crisis , a crippling drivers ' strike and Government takeover . <P> Chalk 's problems stem from what Senator George Murphy terms " some new type of financial legerdemain , " but what might more accurately be attributed to , as Senator John J. Williams puts it , " a case of having milked the company dry of its assets . " Chalk started out well enough . He replaced old streetcars with spiffy new air-conditioned buses , and demanded prompt , courteous service from his drivers . Longstanding union @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point that they were the fourth best in the country for city transport workers . Within two years , however , Chalk began paying dividends to stockholders , including himself : he and his wife own a third of the stock in the holding company . <P> In 1963 , nearly half of the record-high profit of $1.3 million went into dividends ; two years later the company paid $500,000 in dividends despite losses of $124,000 . By 1967 , when the dividends stopped because of the increasing financial difficulties , Chalk had paid out $4,390,000 to stockholders . <P> Thus shorn of its capital , D.C. Transit began to fall apart . The once-new buses deteriorated into rattletraps : often their air conditioning failed , windows jammed shut , and ripped seats were unrepaired . The drivers threw away their timetables and bunched their runs so that they could travel empty . <P> This month the crisis came to a head . <P> An aroused Senate two weeks ago passed a bill calling for Government takeover and operation of the transit system . Last week drivers threatened to strike over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ averted when Chalk obtained a federal court injunction . Through it all , Chalk , who as president , general counsel and chairman of the board is salaried at $65,000 , hotly denied any mismanagement or payment of too much in dividends . But last year 's losses were $397,500 , and outstanding debts reached $27 million , a 24-1 debt-equity ratio compared to the 4-1 that existed when Chalk took charge . <P> If the House goes along with the Senate in voting a Government seizure , Chalk will probably reap one final windfall . He owns real estate that he pulled away from B.C. Transit and incorporated separately . The price for the company , excluding the real estate , he has set somewhere between $40 million and $50 million . " That , " noted Senator Williams , " is absurd " ; but the Government will nonetheless have to pay a good price to rescue B.C. Transit from its present owners .
