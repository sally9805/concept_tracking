THE GANG THAT COULD N'T SHOOT STRAIGHT <P> Directed by JAMES GOLDSTONE <P> Screenplay by WALDO SALT <P> You do n't have to be Italian to hate The Gang That Could n't Shoot Straight , although that gives you a distinct edge . The movie 's febrile witlessness easily transcends all ethnic boundaries and comes guaranteed to outrage virtually everybody . <P> Italians , however , might-perhaps ought-to take special offense . Jimmy Breslin 's comic novel recorded the exploits of a sad-sack mob of Brooklyn hoods with good-humored scorn . Waldo Salt 's chaotic script turns Breslin 's characters , which were already caricatures , into vicious racial stereotypes . Everyone is either venal , murderous , retarded or deformed ; and since they are almost all Italians , one might be tempted to conclude that everyone whose ancestors were born between Sicily and Milan is a feeble-minded racketeer . <P> The actors , who were apparently given their heads , perform in an assortment of styles that range from self-parody to self-abuse . Jerry Orbach makes the most soporific leading man since Sonny Tufts , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Big Momma would be hard to equal . However , Robert De Niro , as a kleptomaniacal bicycle racer , and Leigh Taylor-Young as his perennially startled paramour , somehow manage to bring a small degree of charm and reality to the lamentable goings on . <P> ?
