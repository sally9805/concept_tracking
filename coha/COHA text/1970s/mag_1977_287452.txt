A California restaurant owner complained of a 40% drop in business . At a Harlem tavern in New York City , patrons insisted that the jukebox be turned off while they discussed the TV program they had just watched ; in Los Angeles , the owner of one discotheque closed down operations altogether . The reason : last week 's twelve-hour dramatization of Alex Haley 's book Roots . <P> Aired over eight consecutive nights , Roots came up roses for ABC . Haley 's story , recounting his ancestors ' brutal passage from life in Africa through slavery in America , attracted nearly 80 million viewers on its third night , making that episode the third most popular TV presentation in history . With almost seven out of every ten sets in use tuned to the drama , the only shows that have had a bigger audience were NBC 's screenings of Gone With the Wind . <P> Rivals Humbled . ABC , which had risked $6 million on the production starring LeVar Burton as Kunta Kinte , Lou Gossett as his slave tutor , and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a week-long domination of the Nielsen ratings . Had ABC gambled even more by delaying the show until the start of the so-called sweep week on Jan. 31 , the triumph would have been even sweeter . During those periods , ratings services measure the audiences of local stations , and the networks often air their strongest shows then to boost affiliate ad rates . <P> To many critics , Roots was an Uncle Tom 's Cabin for television . The short series included a number of unusually graphic scenes : the tribal rite of circumcision , the torturous voyage from Africa aboard a slaver , whippings , rapes and even the hatcheting of Kunta Kinte 's foot . For many black viewers , Roots succeeded in putting flesh on the bones of their Afro-American heritage . " We all knew what slavery was , by hearsay and by family tradition , " noted Boston Journalist Robert Jordan . " But this put all those feelings in living color where you 've got to believe them . " Said Little Rock Teacher Charles Pruitt : " The black kids resent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do it to me like that , ' but the white kids say , ' But look , I 'm not like that now . ' " <P> Roots profoundly disturbed white viewers as well . Said Karen Bernard , 26 , an unemployed Brooklyn teacher , " I cried all the way through one show . I have a child , and the fact that black women lived in fear of losing their children was devastating . " Added Beverly Stallworth of Manchester , N.H. : " I feel some shame that I never cared enough to learn what it was like . " <P> Though few could argue with Roots ' impact , some scholars did find fault with its accuracy . " The manhood rite of the Mandinkan tribe took three or four years , not a couple of days , " noted Dr. Andrew Billingsley , president of Morgan State University . " The series overdoes the black participation in the slave business , while it ignores the main slave traders-Europeans who came into African communities and rounded up people at gunpoint . The passage took longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usually on an island off the African coast , and breeding camps at the end . "
