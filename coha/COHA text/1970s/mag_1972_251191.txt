Like California in the past , Colorado is being promoted as the new haven for Americans who , weary of the dreary densities of urban life , are eager for skiing , hiking and clean air . " Own a piece of Colorado ! " cry the real estate men . The spiel works . Throughout the state , reports the Rocky Mountain Center on Environment , bulldozers are preparing at least 1,000,000 acres for subdivisions . <P> The result is the fast trading easy money of a land boom . Ranchers near Denver or Boulder can sell their holdings of sage and scrub for as much as $3,000 an acre . Colorado is now one of the nation 's fastest-growing states ( seventh after Nevada , Florida , Arizona , Alaska , California and Maryland ) . But there is a mounting fear that the developers ' busy bulldozers threaten the very qualities of their state that Coloradans cherish most . Worried , the Colorado Institute on Population Problems has taken to statewide TV to urge : " Think small . " <P> Should Colorado try to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Love . His feeling is that the state is not as prosperous as it could be and therefore must attract more industry . Since more industry necessarily means more people , the real problem is how to accommodate them . For this reason Love believes that the state desperately needs at least minimal control over its land . <P> To many , it might seem a strange concern for a state whose vast prairies roll wide and empty to the horizon , whose lonely mountains range back toward the cloud-capped Continental Divide . But these spaces and slopes are more vulnerable than the site seeker might think . Take so-called " view locations " - sites high on the slopes of the Rockies , which real estate men have been selling off by thousands from Fort Collins to Colorado Springs . Unpolluted air . Privacy . Dazzling vistas . House tastefully set amidst thick stands of ponderosa or lodgepole pines . No insults to the visiting eye . <P> But there is an environmental catch . Because the slopes are steep , they hold little water , and homes seemingly far apart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also foul each other 's water , since septic tanks do not work well in less than four feet of topsoil , and the slopes have much less . As a result , virtually raw sewage seeps downhill to contaminate wells , ponds or streams . <P> Nor do the problems end there . Developments on steep slopes often are served by a single access road that by itself alters the natural flow of moisture . Moreover , with only one road for access , any subdivision can become a dangerous firetrap . " Many developers seem not to realize that fire runs uphill faster than on the flat , " says Oscar Schmunk , deputy forester . Even now , the slopes are occasionally marked by the lonely stone chimneys of burned-out homes . The fire fighters call them " tombstones . " They predict that within five years , if the present rush to live on the slopes continues , Colorado will have disastrous slope fires like California's.
