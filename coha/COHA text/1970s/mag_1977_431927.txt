But they give better results in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closer look at both types . Pigmented stains These are the most popular type around . One reason for this : If you go into a paint store , better than nine out of 10 cans of stain on the shelves will be pigmented stains ; there 's little else to choose . But there 's another reason . Pigmented stains ? or pigmented wiping stains ? are very easy to use . That 's why they were developed . You can slop them on any old way , let them set a while , then wipe them off . The result is even coverage . But you get this even coverage at a price : The thin film of pigment left behind does more than color the Continued @# @#  | wood . It also masks it to a degree . Like a light haze , it hides the detail in the grain , dulls the fire in the wood , and reduces its depth . Admittedly this dulling effect is subtle . But it is real enough to deter you from using a pigment stain on anything made of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the beauty in a fine piece of curly maple or striped mahogany just to get ease of application . use the same wood you will use for a finished piece . Here are progress . diluted water stains . Another problem with pigment stains : The pigments tend to co. most in blemishes and poorly sanded. areas . This puts a premium on care ' preparation of the wood . Poor prep aration will result in a splotchy of with smoother areas lighter than t rougher areas , and blemishes staining out against a lighter background But pigmented wiping stains d good job on softwoods such as pine . And their tendency to collect in blem-@# @#  | ishes makes them ideal for distressed-look furniture . So you might want to use one on a piece of Early American pine furniture , to give it an aged and use-worn look . Pigmented stains are ideal in large-area applications , as well ? on floors or pine paneling , for example . Here ease of application is vital . The pigmented stains will go without a lap mark . And since floors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , any slight masking of the wood 's beauty will go unnoticed . How do you tell the difference between a pigmented stain and a dye stain ? First of all , if the stain comes in a can , and it is readily available at a paint store , it probably contains pigment . To be sure , check the ingredients on the label . Study the largest can size available : Often you 'll find more information on the large cans than on the half pints . If you find an ingredients list , look for the word " pigment . " If it 's there , you have a pigmented stain . Other tip-off words are silica and silicates ? opaque solids , in other words . Pay no attention to the vehicle listed in the ingredients . Whether a pigment stain is a latex , an oil , or any other type makes little difference . All pigmented stains give fairly much the same results , no matter how they are thinned . No ingredients list ? Do the instructions tell you to stir the stain thoroughly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solid pigments in that can . If all else fails , pop the can open and look inside . Does the mixture look cloudy or opaque ? More like mud than tea or coffee ? Then it is pigmented . Note : Some stains ? Minwax , for example ? contain both dyes and pigments . If you want a stain with clarity and brilliance , do n't stir the solids up . But if you want the solids ? to accentuate distress marks , or to get a slightly darker tone ? go ahead and stir . Dye stains These come in a variety of types . Basically they are soluble dyes , and are usually sold in powder form . One type dissolves in water , another in oil and lacquer solvents , a third in alcohol . A fourth type , sold already mixed in a special solvent , is called non-grain-raising , or NGR . By far , the most useful of all of these is the type you get in powder form and dissolve in water . These water stains have a lot of advantages . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inexpensive . A pack of powder for about 70 cents will make a quart of stock solution . In use , you may dilute this solution , so in effect you can get a gallon or more for less than a buck . ? It penetrates deep into the wood , locks into the fibers , and wo n't fade . ? It is compatible with any finish you put over it . ? It is crystal-clear , so it colors without obscuring . ? It is easy to custom-mix . Dilute it with water to get just the right shade . Or blend two or more colors to get just the right hue . ? It is easy to clean off your brush by just rinsing in water . If this stuff is so good , why is it so hard to find in stores ? Probably because it takes a little more work to apply it . Whenever you wet freshly sanded wood with water , tiny whiskers of wood will stand up , leaving a fuzzy surface . The same thing happens when you brush on a coat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raise the grain on purpose before staining , then lightly sand the whiskers away . The usual procedure is to sponge the carefully sanded wood with warm water to raise the grain . Let the wood dry , then sand very lightly with 220 paper ? only enough to remove the fuzz . Now you can use the water stain with no problem ; the fibers will not rise again . Applying water stain is easy enough . The idea is to flood the surface of your work with a good wet coat of stain . Use a fairly stiff nylon brush as large as is practical for the size of your work ? so you can force the stain into the pores of the wood . Keep the brush wet at all times , avoiding the temptation to stretch the stain out , but be careful not to splash stain ahead of yourself . That 's about it . It 's not very common for the cheapest to be the best , but in this case it 's true . There is , however , one weakness in water stains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are very careful about removing the old finish , some of it will remain behind in the wood . There , it will interfere with the penetration of the water stain . So for refinishing , use one of the other dye stains , either NGR or oil type . NGR stains Like water stains , NGR 's are clear dyes , but they are dissolved in a special solvent that wo n't raise the grain . Though they are not as cheap as water stains , they have most of the other advantages . But you 'll find them a little trickier to apply . The additional step of raising the grain is eliminated , but now you have a new problem : These stains dry faster , so you have to work quickly and smoothly to avoid lap marks and unevenness . That 's why you should use water stains whenever possible , saving the NGR 's for refinishing . The NGR 's are ideal for this kind of work because they penetrate so vigorously . A bit of the old finish left in the wood wo n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are the same as for water . Work as rapidly as possible ? a big brush helps ? and keep the brush wet . If you apply the stain too thin , it will dry too fast , and drying too fast leaves lap marks . Start each fresh brushful a few inches away from where the last one left off . Use long strokes , and do n't go back to fuss over areas already stained ? you 'll make them darker . Most NGR stains are very dark when used full-strength , so buy some thinner when you buy the stain . Figure on at least a quart of thinner per quart of stain . Even more thinner wo n't hurt , but you can thin most NGR stains with alcohol in a pinch . Alcohol stains Stay away from these : They dry too fast to be evenly applied with a brush . Even the pros use spray guns when they work with alcohol stains . With water and NGR stains in your shop , you do n't need alcohol types . Oil-type dye stains Also a powdered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or ? ideally ? benzol . Some will also dissolve in lacquer thinner . While you might use some of these powders dissolved in varnish for special shading or toning application , I do n't see much use for them in the home shop . They offer no advantages over water or NGR stains , and they have a number of shortcomings : They dry slowly , often forcing you to wait 24 hours before you can resume finishing . Some of them present compatibility problems with Continued on page 196 OCTOBER 1977 135  | paste-wood fillers , varnishes , and lacquers . Specialty stains In addition to the two big classes of stains mentioned so far , there are also a number of specialty products . Here 's a quick listing : ? Varnish stains . These are , at their best , colored dyes dissolved in varnish . The idea is to stain and varnish stains in to darken and seal very well . The problem is brushmarks : Slight variations in the thickness of the varnish film create large variations in the shade of the stain . Brushmarks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use for varnish stains is to darken and seal inconspicuous parts of your work , such as insides of drawers or backs of cabinets . Another application for varnish stains is toning and shading . You can apply the stuff with a cheap hobby air brush to blend in light pieces of wood on furniture glued up from stock that lacks uniformity of color . I also used it to put a beautiful shaded finish on a guitar . ? Spray stains . In aerosol cans , these may be varnish stains or stains built around a lacquer base ; they are most useful for blending . ? Blending stains . These are powders used for touching up and repairing over existing finishes . You apply them by rubbing them in with a rag dampened with a padding lacquer . They can also be used to finish bare wood , again by rubbing , but this is a technique that requires more skill than any other staining method . ? Bleaches . These are not actually stains , but they are used for the same purpose ; changing the color of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ especially for wood , which are usually based on hydrogen peroxide and oxalic acid . ? Chemical stains . Certain chemicals when applied to wood will change its color . For example , a dilute solution of potassium permanganate does a good job of ageing pine . The stuff is purple , but when brushed on , it reacts with the wood to form a nice amber . Lye and washing soda will both turn wood a light brown . And steel wool dissolved overnight in vinegar will turn new pine a beautiful weathered driftwood gray . You handle all these chemical stains like water stains : An ounce of soda , lye , or potassium permanganate in a quart of water produces a g working solution . Neutralize the with a vinegar soak after the solution dries . When to use stains Most amateurs break out the s when they want to make one k ' of wood look like another . This okay as long as you work wit reason . Remember , staining cha es only the color of the wood , its grain pattern and pore structu @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least start with a w with similar grain and texture . Birch plywood , for example , w stain to look quite a bit like a nu ber of other hardwoods . Fir plyw will not . It has a wild flamelike grai that will give it away no matt what color you stain it . Another reason for staining is t make new wood look older . Turnin a piece of fresh white pine into an instant antique is easy with stain , . It will give good results far more often than staining to duplicate another species . The most common reason for staining the fine hardwoods is to give them the color we have grown to expect from them . Most of the hardwoods I see today lack character . Maybe it 's because they are force-dried and rushed through the lumbermaking process before the . have a chance to age . But stains can perk them all up . Q @#
