The bigger its scale , the more " important " the picture : so a common American reflex goes . Indian art never shared it . The proof is India 's most developed form of painting : the miniature . Commissioned by rajahs , Moguls and well-off merchants , bound in albums and luxuriously scrutinized , these tiny images were as important in the East - from the 16th century onward-as panel painting in the West . The spring exhibition at Manhattan 's Asia House is " A Flower from Every Meadow , " a selection of 86 Indian paintings ranging in date from about 1520 to 1900 . Chosen and elegantly catalogued by Art Historian Stuart Carey Welch , the 86 miniatures from American collections constitute one of the year 's more delectable shows . The word Mogul has come , for us , to signify gross , unvarnished power : the beefy hand on the limousine telephone . But the Mughal emperors , the Muslim despots who left their dynastic name to the English tongue , lived within a structure of taste so exquisite that there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ art , whether Muslim or Hindu , was permeated by a meticulously apportioned lavishness . Adjectives tend to buckle under its splendors . One chubby royal playboy , Jagat Singh II of Mewar , spent 250,000 - at a time when a field peasant might hope to earn seven shillings a year - building and embellishing pavilions on the islands of his private lake , be fore he died at the tender age of 18 in 1752 .

An 18th century rajah , ensconced on a swing , conducts an orchestra of stiffly profiled girls against the beautifully austere background of his black and white marble palace ( see color page ) ; a Mughal potentate presides over the fertility celebration of Holi , while the white-robed members of his court play at a mock battle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Though the historical divisions of Indian miniature painting are bewildering to most viewers , a medley of schools and styles , the pictures themselves are not . Their message is hedonism , raised to the nth power . <P> Saris . It was an art with no dark corners . The most extreme emotion that miniaturists normally allowed their figures was the decorative loneliness of palace ladies waiting for their lovers , as in the late 16th century Deccan painting of Girls in a Wood . Pattern is all : gold-spangled meadow and oddly scal loped red rocks ; the delicate twist of tree trunks echoing the borders of the girls ' saris . Indeed one of the pleasures of Indian miniatures lies in how nature is formalized while losing none of its vitality . In that flattened space , each shape presses up to the eye as firmly as in any Matisse . But the energy remains . The rolling , sinuous line of one great Deccan miniature , Subduing an Enraged Elephant , becomes a short hand for movement ; every detail , from the trampling caparisoned beast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) to the Persian curves and rhythms of poppy stems and rocks behind it , writhes with force .
