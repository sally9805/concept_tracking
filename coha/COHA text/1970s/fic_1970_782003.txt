 | president of the Sloan , looked up from her desk with her usual calm . " Mr. Thatcher circularized the memo that he was going to be away from the office for three weeks , Mr. Trinkam , " she said . " I 'm sure you were on the list . " Since Charlie Trinkam was currently acting director of the Trust Department precisely because Mr. Thatcher was away , he glared at her . His retort , however , was forestalled . Everett Gabler , the oldest , and certainly the most meticulous member of Thatcher 's staff , ripped off his glasses , gave them a heated swipe , and carefully avoided glancing at Trinkam . At all times , Charlie 's expansive bonhomie and slapdash life style pained him ; when Trinkam was his nominal superior , pain yielded to pugnacity . " Of course , we know that John is taking a holiday , Miss Corsa , " he said . " What we want to learn from you is how to reach him . After all , he left you his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so much a question as an accusation . When important Wall Street bankers leave the financial district , they do not go to ground . Their secretaries know where they are , or at least where they can be reached during most of the relevant hours of the day . There lies the rub . Those same secretaries have strict orders not to divulge telephone numbers except in cases of emergency . And not everybody agrees on what is a real emergency . At the moment , for example , both Trinkam and Gabler were divided over the Sloan 's response to some ominous queries from the State Banking Commission . They were , however , united in suspecting Miss Corsa of savoring this moment of power . But Miss Corsa , an extremely competent young woman , was above pettiness . " Yes , I know where Mr. Thatcher is , " she explained precisely . " But I do n't know how you can get in touch with him . " Charlie fairly gnashed his teeth , but Gabler raised a pacifying hand . " Why not ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produced a typed card from which she  | read aloud : " From September fourth through September fifteenth , important mail for Mr. Thatcher may be forwarded to the Long Trail Lodge , Sherburne Pass , North Sherburne , Vermont , marked : Hold for Appalachian Trail Hiker . " There was a pause . Then , sadly , Charlie said , " Not again ? " Miss Corsa was in some sympathy with the sentiment . " I 'm afraid so , " she said . Even Everett Gabler was moved to recall common hardship long shared . " Do you remember the year we tried to send Ingersoll to get in touch with him ? " he reminded his audience . " That was the time we needed his signature on the revised Bannister contract . " " How could I ever forget ? " Charlie replied rhetorically . " That was somewhere down in the Smokies . You remember what Ingersoll said when he finally got back ? " They all did . Charlie rose and studied Miss Corsa 's card . " Hold for Appalachian Trail Hiker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's meat . . . Now listen , Everett , this puts the lid on it . We do n't have time to play games . We have to work out some sort of compromise between ourselves . If you want to bring Lancer into it . . . " " What do you mean by compromise ? " Gabler replied stubbornly . They were again deep in dispute when they left Miss Corsa to the solitary possession of John Thatcher 's corner suite on the Sloan 's sixth floor . She returned to her sorting of the mail . She was not surprised by this conflict between Trinkam and Gabler . If past performance meant anything , it was the first of many . Furthermore , she confidently expected Mr. Bowman , from Research , to try wheedling some extra meetings of the Investment Committee . All because Mr. Thatcher had this strange predilection for long walks .  | Things were always difficult when Mr. Thatcher was away . Not that difficulty troubled Miss Corsa . She was fortified by explicit instructions covering most foreseeable contingencies . As well as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Sloan when she was away . Still , in the privacy of her own thoughts , Miss Corsa agreed with Charlie Trinkam . She accepted most of her employer 's foibles even if she did not understand them . But , incurious as she was , Queens-bred Miss Corsa did wonder why an important man like Mr. Thatcher should be so attached to marching through the countryside between Maine and Georgia . A stroll around Kissena Park was one thing The telephone put an end to these thoughts . " No , " she said . " Mr. Thatcher is not available . No , I 'm afraid not . . . . " John Putnam Thatcher , methodically placing one foot before the other , three hundred miles north of Wall Street , was removed in fact and in spirit from New York State 's menace to its banks . He was trudging along America 's longest foot trail . It unrolled endlessly before him over each successive horizon . The Appalachian Trail , extending from Maine to Georgia , is over two thousand miles long . A crest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another , the White Mountains , the Green Mountains , the Blue Ridge and the Great Smokies . On federally owned lands , a mile-wide swath on either side is preserved as natural wilderness . On state owned lands , the swath diminishes to a half mile on either side . Happily , over half the trail passes through public lands . On private property , hikers are urged to keep to their right of way , in order to avoid charges of trespassing . Scattered along the Trail , a day 's easy march from each other , are sleeping shelters . Thatcher had not seen the Trail for a year . He was reminded of how much he forgot between each annual retreat to the perfect antidote for Wall Street . There were the white blazes systematically marking the way . And , here in New England ,  | of course , there was the surprisingly sporadic nature of the views . To the uninitiated it might appear that a crest trail would provide one vista after another . And so it did , in the northernmost reaches of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But Thatcher and his companion , Henry Morland , were cutting southward across New Hampshire into Vermont . So they were below the timberline and inevitably hemmed in by forest on either side . Only an occasional clearing or a fold in the hillside revealed the valleys and lakes scattered far below . In its own way , this was more satisfying than a continuing panorama . It provided more than beauty : it provided anticipation and suspense . " We 'll get there in good time , " Henry Morland spoke over his pack frame . " Good , " said Thatcher . " How do your boots feel ? " " Fine . " Moving forward with the easy , slow pace of the experienced walker , Thatcher contemplated his boots with approval . Then , since he was not one of those who take to the hills to leave the world behind , he considered also a commercial establishment , L. L. Bean , of Freeport , Maine . The boots currently performing so satisfactorily had come from L. L. Bean  --  in parts , to be sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; earlier they had had tongues removed , uppers restitched , bindings replaced . Each transaction , whether by mail or by personal visit , had convinced Thatcher that these boots remained as technically interesting to L. L. Bean as they did to him . On this , the second day of a prolonged trek , he had reason to be grateful . L. L. Bean , he recalled , was open twenty-four hours a day , 365 days a year , ready to serve hunters bound for the Maine woods , climbers setting forth to scale Mount Washington , and backyard barbecuers renting places in Boothbay Harbor , with any conceivable gear they ' night desire . Thatcher reminded himself , stepping meantime over a fallen branch , to talk to Henry about this . For Henry , a small spare figure topped by a nut-brown pate ,  | was the owner of The Pepper Mill , a mail-order business in Pepperton , New Hampshire . In that guise , Henry dispatched maple syrup , sconces , early American TV carts and deacon 's benches from Pepperton to most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warehouse . But , with an eye to tourists , Henry had appended a picturesque country store , complete with apothecary jars filled with penny candies . Anyone who made as good a living as Henry did exporting Yankee handicrafts ( frequently imported from Hong Kong ) must know how businesses were run in northern New England . This was another noteworthy aspect of modern America , Thatcher thought , registering at the same time that the trail had begun climbing again . He himself had been born and reared in Sunapee , New Hampshire . But he had left small-town New England for Harvard many years ago , and after that for Wall Street . Consequently , for specialized insights into modern ways to play the Down East game , he would have to consult Henry Morland . Henry , born in Cedar Rapids , Iowa , had carved a respectable business career in New York before deciding , years ago , to strike out with his own firm in rural New Hampshire . They plodded on in companionable silence . September was a good time to be on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but here on the heights there were already brilliant crimson touches . The long light of the westering sun painted the valley below , sometimes visible through clearings , with dramatic shadows . Filtered by greenery , a golden warmth mellowed the austere New England light . " Good God ! " Henry had halted abruptly . A step brought Thatcher to his side . Henry was peering into the distance , down the trail . " Do you see what I see ? " he demanded . Thatcher , whose vision was excellent , replied that he did . A turn on the trail had brought them to a long , straight alley . At its end , perhaps thirty yards ahead , two young people sat slumped against a huge boulder .  | " What are they doing here ? " Henry asked . " Well , after all , Henry , " Thatcher pointed out reasonably , " the Appalachian Trail is open to the public . Think of how many people you would have met up here before Labor Day . " Henry shook this observation aside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's not what I mean at all , John . Just look at those getups , will you ? " Thatcher did , and conceded that Henry had a point . The young woman was wearing a complex garment of bold blackand-white stripes which flowed from neck to ankle . Her escort , a young man , sported a striped French sailor 's shirt over saffron yellow slacks . Anything less appropriate for movement anywhere in rural New England , let alone the Appalachian Trail , would have been hard to find . " I tell you ? " muttered Henry , setting forward on the trot . But Thatcher was not the hard-core purist that Henry was . The world , he knew , abounds with people who want to climb Mount McKinley in opera pumps , to cross the Atlantic in a canoe , to bicycle through Afghanistan . Possibly Henry had retreated from the big city too early to appreciate this . However , any comments Thatcher might have been contemplating along these lines were not destined to be uttered . For , as they approached , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only singularly ill equipped for a September evening 3,000 feet above sea level on the Appalachian Trail . They already knew it . The young woman was a picture of misery . Long black hair hung in disarray around a small , dejected face . The young man clambered painfully to his feet as Henry fetched up before him smartly . Thatcher brought up the rear at a more leisurely pace . " Hello , " said the young man . Henry , who enjoyed throwing himself into roles , immediately became a kindly but stern schoolmaster , of the old school . " What 's the trouble ? "  | The young man , who had rather long black hair himself , was past taking offense . " We 're lost , " he confessed unhappily . He looked back at his companion . " Do n't worry , Sukey . They 'll help us . " Henry , like most enthusiasts , could be obtuse in some ways . " Lost ? " he said with high good humor . " Now , you ca n't get lost up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you folks want to be ? " He was now doing the Yankee handyman to perfection . The young couple , however , did not recognize dramatic performances . " We left our car on Route 27 , " they reported . " North or south ? " Henry asked artlessly . Two blank stares were his only response . " Well , where were you coming from ? " This evoked a spate of tumbled explanations which Henry finally quelled with an upraised palm . " Now , let 's get this straight . You 'd been to some construction site and you were heading back south to the White Mountains Motel . About three miles short of the motel , you decided to take a walk ? " " And we got lost so that there was nothing but trees , trees , trees , until we found this place , " they chanted in unison . " Then we stopped ? " But Henry was interested in geography , not suffering . " Then as near as I can make out , " he broke in firmly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your car . You go back north along the trail until you get to the place that 's got a white blaze and a blue blaze , then you head off the trail , going due southeast , until you hit the riverbed , and follow that east by southeast to Route 27 . Then , head south for your car . Should be about three miles , all told . " The young man stared at Henry with a hopelessness that Thatcher had rarely seen equaled . " Three miles ? " he repeated dully , following Henry 's gesture toward the tree-lined trail . " Three miles ? " Then , as Thatcher had feared she would , Sukey burst into tears .  | APPALLED , HENRY MORLAND stared at the results of his cheerful directions . As the sobbing continued , his bewilderment became tinged with resentment . " What 's she crying about ? " he muttered to Thatcher . The young man had moved behind the girl and placed his hands on her shoulders . Now he straightened and glared across her bowed head . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " What 's she got to be upset about ? " Henry demanded . " All I did was tell you how to get back to the road . " Thatcher thought he saw light . " Maybe they did n't understand your explanation , " he suggested . It was useless , of course , to expect Henry to realize his instructions might just as well have been phrased in Mongolian . " Oh , is that all ? Well , I 'll show you on the map . Get it out for me , will you , John ? " Obligingly Thatcher unstrapped the outer pocket of Henry 's pack and extracted the mapcase . While Henry found the proper U.S. Geological Survey section , the young man relayed the good news . " Sukey ! Did you hear ? They 've got a map . Everything 's all right . " He accompanied these tidings with several hearty thumps on her back . Under this bracing treatment , Sukey revived . She lowered her hands and smiled at him . " Oh , Alan , go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place ! " 15  | Alan beamed happily . " By the way , " he said , advancing to Henry 's side , " we 're Sukey and Alan Davidson . " The jubilation was short-lived . While Thatcher completed the self-introductions , Alan bent forward to look at the survey section . The next instant , he gave an involuntary yelp of protest . " But it is n't a real map , " he stammered . " It does n't have any roads on it . " " It 's a topographic map , " Henry explained . " See , this is where we are now , on the Appalachian Trail . It 's a crest trail , so it 's at the highest point on the map . " Steadily , Henry droned on . The shortest route to the road where they had left their car was south by southeast . Unfortunately that route involved the steepest grandient . Perhaps it would be wiser , on the whole , if they went southeast until they hit the road and then turned south . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on which to take bearings . All they had to do was . . . Henry 's voice , eliciting no response , was steadily growing less confident . Even Sukey became anxious . " What is it ? " she asked . " Is something wrong , Alan ? " " No , no , " her husband lied gallantly . " Everything 's fine , Sukey . But I think maybe I 'd better look at this a little longer . " A hideous suspicion began to dawn on Henry . " You do have a compass , do n't you ? " " Well , actually , we do n't . " Alan lowered his head studiously . To keep Henry from comment , Thatcher intervened . " Tell me , " he asked kindly , " what exactly are you doing on the Appalachian Trail ? " As an exercise in drawing fire , this was not successful since Sukey unguardedly exclaimed , " Oh , is that where we are ? " " Control yourself , Henry , " Thatcher murmured . The Davidsons proceeded to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weekending in New Hampshire , with a view to buying a vacation home . They had inspected a large construction site . They had studied model summer cottages and  | ski chalets . They had , Alan Davidson said , decided to go for a walk . " I mean , " he said , " the one thing we had n't seen much of was New Hampshire . " Well , that was another question answered . Not only did the Davidsons not have a compass . They had probably never seen a compass . Wordlessly , Thatcher caught Henry 's eye . Their duty was clear . Simple humanity demanded that these innocents be personally escorted to the nearest road . " We 'll go with you , " he announced . Alan and Sukey overflowed with gratitude . " It 's terribly nice of you , " Sukey said warmly . " We 're sorry to take you out of your way . I mean , I suppose you 're going somewhere . " She ended with a dubious glance at their surroundings and at the older men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form of madness . Thatcher made no attempt to enlighten her . " That 's all right , " he said . " It 's not far . It wo n't take us more than fortyfive minutes . " At first he did not realize his error . Alan and Sukey were so relieved to acquire an escort that they set off in Henry 's wake with an initial burst of energy . Thatcher brought up the rear , content with his mild act of charity . But , with the best will in the world , they could not achieve a smooth rate of progress . As they stopped for the fifteenth time in ten minutes to untangle Sukey from the embrace of a tendril of briars , Thatcher permitted himself a comment . " These slacks of yours , " he said , sucking a thumb , " are n't very practical . " Sukey looked down . " But they 're my country clothes . I do n't see why I have so much more trouble than the rest of you . " Henry had followed her gaze @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but , somewhere around the knees , they blossomed out into an abundance of material and became miniature Zouave skirts .  | " What kind of country did you have in mind ? " he asked , genuinely interested . Sukey flushed . " I 've been wearing them all summer without any trouble . Everywhere . All over Europe . " " We were on our honeymoon , " Alan amplified . " Spain and the South of France and Greece . " " Oh , " said Henry without enthusiasm . " Beaches . " Sukey shifted from defense to offense , " I 'll tell you what . The country in Europe is n't like this at all . There are always people around and there is n't all this stuff growing everywhere . " She scowled resentfully at the trees and the underbrush . Henry Morland was nothing if not a gentleman . He was n't going to hit Sukey when she was down , even though his gorge rose at this comparison between resort plages and the Appalachians . " I can see how it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ready now ? " But Thatcher and Morland had failed to appreciate just how far down Sukey was . The rejuvenating effect of companionship had worn off now . Henry , loping effortlessly ahead and sliding neatly through branches that became stinging whips when the Davidsons approached , knew only that Thatcher called to him three times to slacken the pace . Thatcher , who had fallen back to protect himself against the effects of the Davidsons ' tumultuous passage , could see only that Sukey was limping . Finally they came to a grove of tall pines , where the mulch of pine needles had kept the underbrush at bay . Thatcher pulled abreast , took one look , and called a halt . Sukey 's face was white , her lower lip was gripped tightly under her teeth and she swayed as she stood . Thatcher frowned , recalling what the Davidson boy had said . If the girl had only been in the woods for an hour , or an hour and a half , she could n't possibly be as exhausted as she looked . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their side . Thatcher shook his head irately . He was silently conning a list of alarming possibilities . Convalescence , pregnancy , debilitating disease . . .  | Sukey released her lip and spoke tremulously . " It 's my feet , " she gasped . Then she hitched up her slacks and the mystery was clarified . Simultaneously Henry and Thatcher breathed sighs of relief . Sukey was not suffering from exhaustion and shock . Sukey was in pain . The voluminous folds breaking over her instep had concealed the fact that she was shod in sandals secured by a thong passing between her toes . Thatcher directed a look at his old friend . Now was no time for Henry to ask why Sukey went mountain climbing in sandals . " They have very thick soles , " said Sukey , answering the unspoken accusation . Thatcher went down on one knee . " I do n't think that 's the problem . Here , let me take a look . " As he had expected , grit and fine splinters had lodged under the toes . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wherever it passed . " You 're going to have a fine crop of blisters , " he remarked , restoring her foot to ground . " The less walking you do , the better . " Henry was already deep in his map . " It 's simple enough . There 's an old logging trail near here . We 'll get Sukey that far , and I 'll go ahead to send a car for you . " " You could get our car , " Alan suggested . " I 've got the keys here . " Henry repressed his impatience . " I will if I have to . But this construction site you mentioned must be nearer . And we probably ought to have a jeep or something for that trail . Do you know when they stop work at the site ? " Neither Davidson had the slightest idea . " It 's five-thirty now , " Henry pointed out . " What about a phone ? Is there one there ? " Again Alan began to shake his head , but Sukey stopped him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mr. Quinlan used it while we were there . " Thatcher and Henry made their plans as they moved at a cripple 's pace to the logging trail , Alan supporting Sukey be-  | hind them . Henry would go ahead to the site and phone the motel for a vehicle . Thatcher would remain with the Davidsons until succor arrived . With luck this good deed would be completed within the hour ; they could still regain the trail and reach the shelter where they proposed to spend the night . With a last cheerful grin , Henry bounded athletically into the brush . A short exploration led Thatcher to a bubbling brook not thirty yards from their rendezvous point . Carefully stacking the two packs so they were visible to an approaching car , he shifted the Davidsons to brookside and directed Sukey to soak her feet . " It will be cold , " he warned , " but it will save you a good deal of discomfort tomorrow . " Sukey obeyed and , after a - period of acclimation , agreed that it was heavenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's the first time I 've felt comfortable this whole weekend . " " But I thought you said you were staying in a motel , " Thatcher remarked . " That you 'd come up here to inspect a summer place . " " That 's what we thought , " Alan said bitterly . " They said it would be a weekend when you could see New England at its best . But it has n't turned out that way at all . It 's been a rat race from beginning to end . " " They think just because it 's free , we have to do everything they say . You 'd think we 'd sold them our souls or something ! " Sukey 's spirits were recovering something of their natural fire . Alan became very grave . " Of course , we realize that we live in a materialistic society where everything is directed to a profit goal , but we 'd never seen anything like this ! " Even on vacation , a banker is interested in profit goals . And Thatcher thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you mean that you were offered a free weekend here by one of these development colonies so they could try to sell you a lot ? " he asked . Alan and Sukey flowered under this interest . They had re-  | ceived a brochure in the mail , they explained . It was all about a colony of vacation homes to be built in New Hampshire , called Fiord Haven . " Fiord ? " Thatcher exclaimed in spite of himself . " But this is nowhere near the sea . " " They have a lake . And there 's going to be a ski tow and tennis courts and a golf course . And once you buy the lot , you can use that as a down payment against a house . " " But the main thing is the private tow . " Alan 's eyes sparkled with enthusiasm . " Then you would n't have to wait in line for hours the way you do at Cannon Ball and Black Mountain . And they are going to have really good ski trails . " " Naturally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of property now . We believe in human values , not property rights . " Sukey seemed to feel that Alan was not as alert as he might be to this aspect of the situation . " But they offered us a free weekend at this motel to come up and inspect the development . And we 'd never been to New Hampshire , so we thought  --  why not ? We thought it would be fun . " Alan barked a short laugh . " Fun ! Were we ever taken ! The minute we got here , the hard sell started . That was last night . And it has n't let up since . " Almost apologetically , Thatcher said , " I suppose that 's why they offered you the weekend . So that they could deliver a hard sell . " Alan realized he was being accused of naivete . " Naturally we expected something like that . We know big companies do n't do things out of charity . " He expanded this theme , assisted by Sukey . The Davidsons had no illusions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had been surprised , very surprised . " We expected to give them an hour or two of our time . That would n't have been too bad . As a matter of fact , we were interested to hear how these places are arranged . " Alan was again showing signs of apostasy . Gently Thatcher explained that realty companies could get  | an hour or two of prospective clients ' time without any extraordinary efforts . The reason they transported a whole batch of potential purchasers to deserted country spots was in order to force them to listen for much longer periods than they would ordinarily agree to . " But you do n't understand what it 's been like . It 's just unbelievable . " Sukey was in full swing . The tide of woe broke over Thatcher 's head . They had been awakened at seven . They had listened to a two-hour lecture . Then they had been taken on a two-hour tour . After lunch , they had been split into small groups , each the object of attack by a single salesman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see individual sites . Tonight there would be slides and another lecture . Tomorrow would be a repeat performance . " And that salesman , Burt O'Neil , he tried to tell us that we were n't supposed to take tomorrow morning off to visit some friends . How do you like that ? " " That 's really why we went for a walk in the woods , " Alan intervened . " We knew if we went back to the motel , someone would be waiting to grab us with another sales pitch . " " That 's a pretty stupid way to run a business . " Sukey swept back a curtain of dark hair scornfully . " All they do is make people mad . " Thatcher forebore to point out that , however unpleasant the process , it seemed to have succeeded in waking some spark in Alan . It would be unkind and , in any event , he had other things to think about . He looked at his watch again . Henry had been gone for nearly an hour . It should not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the development site . What had happened ? As Alan and Sukey continued their antiphonal lament , Thatcher reviewed the possibilities . He was not personally worried about Henry . That is , he did not fear a fall , a sprained ankle , a wrong direction . What he did fear was Henry 's excessive zeal . Suppose the phone at the site had been locked up ? What would Henry do ? Probably break in . Suppose it had been  | disconnected ? Henry was not above overcoming that difficulty too . Heedless of the chatter raining down on him , Thatcher frowned . That was the trouble . Henry was efficient and Henry was determined . However misguided his actions , they usually achieved their goal . Even if he had been forced to strew disgruntled realtors and phone companies behind , Henry should have returned by now . Or a car should have arrived . Thatcher squinted at the lengthening shadows . Soon he would have to decide . He could wait for Henry or he could move Sukey down the logging trail while there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than on open country . He would give Henry exactly one half hour . The shadow of the tall oak which he was using as his measuring stick was just creeping toward the large boulder in the stream when he heard voices calling . Good , Henry had arrived with reinforcements . He arose from his log and let his own voice ring out . " Henry ! We 're coming ! " Letting the Davidsons follow slowly , he strode rapidly back to the packsacks . At first , he could not see clearly because of the gloom after the glare of sunset on water . He could dimly make out the shape of a car and several men . Then his eyes adjusted . Oh , my God , he thought to himself , what has Henry done now ? Because Henry , looking much smaller , was flanked by two enormous state policemen . " John , " he said , sounding almost embarrassed , " I 'm terribly sorry , but there 's been a murder ! "  | WHATEVER JOHN THATCHER had expected , it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the troopers intervened . " Now just a minute , " he said . " Let 's get a few things straight , right away . Mr. Morland said there were supposed to be three of you . Is that the other two I hear ? " Crashing thuds indicated that the Davidsons were making their usual progress through cover . A moment more , and they emerged from the trees to join the group . They seemed indifferent to Henry 's official companions . Sukey had eyes only for the vehicle which now blocked the logging trail . " A car ! " she said rapturously . " How lovely ! " The trooper , after a swift inspection of her attire , nodded to himself . " We 'll drive you back in a little while , " he offered . " If you 'll just be patient , I have a few questions to ask first . " He turned to Thatcher . " Would you mind telling us what you 're doing in these parts ? " Thatcher restrained his impatience . Clearly the police @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to substantiating Henry 's alibi , Thatcher explained that they had left the Morland home yesterday morning after breakfast with Henry 's wife . They had done eighteen miles in easy stages , arriving to spend the night at the Upper Brook Shelter . After an early start , they had proceeded southward an additional twenty miles to their encounter with the Davidsons.  | " Anybody else at the shelter last night ? " Captain Frewen asked . Yes , there had been two members of the Dartmouth Outing Club on their way north . Thatcher concluded with a careful account of the Davidsons ' tribulations , culminating in Henry 's decision to seek a telephone . " That checks out , " the captain said . " Now , Mr. Morland tells us he owns The Pepper Mill up in Pepperton . You from up there too ? " Thatcher shook his head . " No , I 'm from New York . I 'm on vacation . " " Address ? " Thatcher produced his business card . The captain inspected it and carefully inserted it in his notebook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ banker on a three-week hiking trip . The Appalachian Trail , he knew , attracted all sorts . " Fine , " he said calmly . " Now , if you two do n't mind waiting here , there are a few questions I want to ask the young people . But we might as well get Mrs. Davidson sitting down in the car while we 're at it . " Either the Davidsons were a remarkably incurious young couple , Thatcher decided , or they had given up expecting to understand anything that happened to them in New Hampshire . Maybe they thought State Police and alibis were the natural consequence of becoming lost in the woods . Certainly they seemed to regard the activity of the police as less eccentric than that of others . As they trailed off to the car , Alan 's voice came floating back . " Thirty-eight miles , Sukey ! They must be crazy . " Thatcher gave the entire party time to get out of earshot . Then he wheeled toward Henry . " Well ? " he demanded . " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that much to tell . " But obediently he unfolded his tale . After leaving the logging trail , Henry had set himself a smart  | pace through the woods . His only thought was to hang the albatross of the Davidsons around someone else 's neck as rapidly as possible . He had experienced no real difficulty in locating the construction site of Fiord Haven . " Although I would have gotten there ten minutes earlier if that boy could tell the difference between north and north by northeast , " he grumbled . " He never pretended he was much of a navigator . Go on . " At the site , Henry had first located the telephone line coming into the clearing , then followed it to a builder 's hut . There he encountered his first problem . The hut had been windowless , its crude batten door firmly padlocked . " So you decided to break in , " Thatcher said sadly . Henry was inclined to cavil . " I do n't know that you could call it breaking in . I was just going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then close it again . " " Leaving everything tidy . " " Well , naturally , " said Henry , rather affronted . To accomplish his end , Henry had examined the obstacles . The door was powerful , the padlock was huge , but the hasp and staple were affixed to the building with ordinary nails . Like Archimedes , all he wanted was a lever . Henry set off to examine the site , confident that wherever there was construction there would be at least one tool someone had neglected to stow away . At first he had been unsuccessful . To the right of the hut , individual homes were being laid out . But the work consisted chiefly of bulldozing cellar holes and pouring foundations , neither activity encouraging the use of hand tools . Then he had retraced his steps and had been more fortunate . To the left of the hut , at some distance from the rest of the compound , there was a building clearly intended as a main lodge . It was large and , more to the point , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spot it at first because it was so low , " he explained . " No gables or anything . Can you imagine a flat roof on a ski lodge ? "  | " That 's modern architecture , Henry . " Thatcher dismissed esthetics firmly . " I suppose you went in ? " Henry had . Once inside , he had been pleased to observe that even the interior framing had been erected . This raised the possibility of stray chisels and crowbars but , at the same time , made search more difficult . " It was getting dark in there , and I had to go slow . I did n't want to miss anything on the floor . And that 's where it was . The fourth room I went into , I looked down at the floor and there , in the shadow , was a body . And , right by its side , was this hammer covered with blood . " Henry gulped . " I tell you I almost panicked . " " Was it very messy ? " Thatcher asked delicately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Henry did not seem aware that his answer was surprising . " You see , I could n't tell whether he was dead or alive . Oh , there was blood all over his head , and I was pretty sure he had a fractured skull . The chances were nine out of ten that he was dead . But what if he was n't ? I did n't dare move him . Finally I decided the only thing to do was to get help as fast as possible . " " You were absolutely right . " " Then I thought I was going to have to use that hammer to get into the phone . I did n't want to touch it . I knew the police would n't like me messing around with it , but what the hell ! The important thing was to get an ambulance right away . But I was lucky . There was a big screwdriver in there , too . I pried off the staple and phoned the police . Waiting for them was pure , undiluted hell . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 's not even nighttime yet . " Henry broke off to look at the twilight in mild surprise . " But they told me over the phone to make sure his nose was free , so I had to go back to the lodge . Then it did n't seem right to leave him alone , so I just stayed there , wondering if there was anything I should be doing . But it was all right . I mean about my not doing anything . When the ambulance came , the doctor said he 'd been dead for over an hour , maybe longer . "  | Thatcher was glad that Henry was absolved in his own mind of all responsibility , but he could see shoals looming ahead . " Tell me , Henry . You said you knew the police would be annoyed if you touched the hammer . There was n't any question , then , that it was murder ? " Henry snorted . " He was lying on his stomach , he 'd been hit on the back of the head , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " That seems conclusive . What did the police make of all this ? " " They asked me what I was doing there , naturally . I told them my story . Then I said that the three of you ought to be gotten out of the woods before nightfall . " Henry gave a sudden weak grin . " I did n't think you 'd enjoy hefting two packs on top of shepherding those two flower children down to the road . As a matter of fact , I did n't have to be very persuasive . The police sounded damned interested in the Davidsons . " Thatcher considered this and nodded . " I suppose that 's logical . They have a man killed over an hour ago . Then we tell them we met two people connected with that construction site running around in a frenzy about an hour and a half ago . There could be a connection . " " Oh , come on , John . If Alan tried to hit someone with a hammer , he 'd brain himself . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really is n't our business . We 've got to decide what we 're going to do when the police are through with us . You do n't think they have any doubts about you ? " Henry had recovered his composure . " Why should they ? I do n't have anything to do with this site . And , while it may seem small potatoes to big bankers like you , The Pepper Mill is a well-known and respected local enterprise . They know I 'm not the sort to run around bashing people just for the fun of it . " " Then , I repeat , what do we do next ? It 's too dark to beat our way back to the Trail . "  | As usual , Henry showed that he had not studied his maps in vain . The surrounding countryside was now dark , but its main features were indelibly recorded for Henry to scan in his own mind . " Look , the Trail crosses Route I 13 about one mile south of the shelter . If Frewen would give us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our way back as soon as the moon rises . The sky is clear as a bell . " Accordingly , when Captain Frewen signaled that his interrogation of the Davidsons was complete , they put their plan to him . He was inclined to cooperate . " Sure . Stick your packs in the trunk , and we 'll crowd in . We 'll have to figure out some way to keep in touch . I suppose you realize that you 'll probably have to come back here ? " They agreed that they would hold themselves at his service . Before they entered the car , Frewen told them that the news of the murder had been broken to Alan and Sukey . Under the circumstances , Thatcher was not surprised to find his companions less vocal during the bouncing ride down the logging trail back to the county road . Here another police car was parked at the side of the road , its roof blinker slowly revolving . " They 'll have the latest news for me , " Frewen said . " I 'll be back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figure leaning into the other car and heard snatches of conversation . " They 've got an ID for you , Cap . " " All right . Let me get at the radio . " Muffled voices continued for several minutes . When the captain returned , he was carrying his open notebook . He took his place by the driver before speaking . As if by accident , he had left his door open so that the ceiling dome light shone down on the faces of his passengers . His voice was almost casual as he turned to examine the Davidsons . " We 've got an identification on the dead man , " he said baldly .  | " Oh ? " Alan muttered when the silence threatened to become oppressive . " Yes . I wonder if it means anything to you . His name was Stephen J. Lester . " But Frewen was looking in the wrong direction . Before the Davidsons , their faces white and strained , could evince any reaction , there was an astonished gasp from Henry Morland . " Lester ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was Steve Lester back there ? " Everybody stared at Henry . Thatcher , who was sharing the front seat with the police , could feel Frewen go rigid . He himself stiffened , first in surprise , then in dismay . " They found a driver 's license on the body , " the captain reported . " It said Stephen J. Lester of Weston , Massachusetts . Friend of yours , Mr. Morland ? " Henry had had time for second thoughts . " Well , I would n't say that . " " An enemy , maybe ? " Frewen persisted . " No , no ! " At last , the Davidsons spoke up . " He was at the motel , " Alan said . " Mr. Lester was thinking of buying a lot at Fiord Haven , " Sukey explained more precisely . Frewen did n't even look at them . " I thought you said you did n't have anything to do with Fiord Haven , Mr. Morland ? " " I did n't . I do n't . I never even heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could say the same for the corpse . " But you knew Mr. Lester ? " " Look , you 'd better let me explain . I belong to the Appalachian Mountain Club . That 's down in Boston . " " I know all about the club . " Frewen 's voice was now a controlled growl . " Well , Lester belonged to the club , too . We were both on a committee together . I 've never seen him except in Boston . " " How long have the two of you been on this committee ? " " About a year or so , I 'd say . "  | " And you stood by his body for half an hour and did n't recognize him ? " Frewen did not attempt to disguise his incredulity . " That 's right . " Henry 's natural pugnacity was asserting itself . Thatcher could not believe that this was the ideal time for it to surface . " Our committee meets every three months . Sometimes I do n't get down to Boston for a meeting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that 's face to face . I 've seen his name on papers twenty or thirty times . Today I spent half an hour with a body lying on its stomach , its head covered with blood . It never occurred to me it was Steve Lester . Make what you want out of that . " What Frewen made out of it became speedily apparent . " All right , Mr. Morland , that 's your story and you 're sticking with it . But I 'd give up this idea of yours about going back to the Trail tonight . I want you where I can keep an eye on you . "  | AND WHERE Captain Frewen could most conveniently keep an eye on Henry was at the White Mountains Motel , the locale for Fiord Haven 's ill-omened weekend . First to feel the chill was the owner of the motel . He disliked having the police in his office . Even more , he disliked being asked to house their suspects . Frewen , having sent the Davidsons to their room with strict injunctions to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You 've got some empty units . " It was not a question . " Fiord Haven has taken the whole motel for the weekend , " said the owner . " They 're building only four or five miles up the road . " " Then get the Fiord Haven people in here , " Frewen ordered . Glowering , the manager reached for the phone . " Mr. Valenti ? I wonder if you and Mr. Quinlan could step into my office ? " During the interval , Henry smouldered in Frewen 's direction , Frewen tapped stubby fingers on the counter , and the motel manager projected outrage . Thatcher wondered where the bar was . Finally , two men entered to break the trance . They were , it developed , the Fiord Haven people . Bluntly , Captain Frewen told them what had happened to Stephen Lester .  | " My God ! " said Ralph Valenti , a big man who somehow looked soft . " My God ! " He sounded distraught . His partner , Eddie Quinlan , had the politician @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tragedy ! " " Now , " said Frewen , " I want Mr. Morland and Mr. Thatcher here for the night . Then I 'm going to have some questions for you people ? " Henry started to mount another protest but Quinlan was too quick for him . " Sure , sure , " he agreed instantly . " Anything we can do . " " Okay , " said Frewen . " I think Mr. Morland and Mr. Thatcher can leave now . " He had reckoned without the motel owner . " If you do n't mind , " he said , thrusting registration forms toward his unwanted guests . As he was filling in the form , Thatcher was given a preview of what lay in store . " My God , " Valenti said again . " And Lester 's wife ! Who 's going to tell her ? " Frewen refused to be excited . Almost heavily , he said : " Do n't worry about that . I 'll tell Mrs. Lester what happened . I 'm going to want to talk to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hands in his pockets , roused himself . " Listen , captain , " he said huskily . " Do we have to break this news to everybody we got up here for the weekend ? We have an evening planned . If we could . . . At this point , the motel manager opened the door , and prepared to usher Thatcher and Morland to their rooms . " You 'll find , " he said , trying to do his duty , " a program of the evening 's activities on the bureau . " Accordingly , ten minutes later , Thatcher and Henry were attending a cocktail party . For the time being , at least , Fiord Haven 's Fun Weekend was continuing . Thatcher looked around . A pianist was playing soft , intricate variations on familiar themes . The bar dispensed cheer with prudent open-handedness . The crowd of perhaps thirty ,  | gathered in the Pine Cone Lounge of the White Mountains Motel , was elegantly clad ; the ladies wore colorful cocktail dresses , the gentlemen sported those antic ensembles advertised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ informed Thatcher , an hour of sociability before dinner . It was to be followed by a luxurious buffet with roast beef , lobster and other delicacies . This in turn would give place to a talk by Mr. Quinlan on the second home as an investment in the future . Mr. Quinlan would be succeeded by James Joel Finley , AIA , the world-famous architect who will discuss the elements of design at Fiord Haven . But all of this , Thatcher knew , was not destined to be . And although no more selfish than the next man , he was relieved . Things were bad enough , without the elements of design . Even the hour of sociability was not , to the disinterested eye , a great triumph . Conspicuously absent was the rising buzz-buzz that is the hallmark of the successful cocktail party . . . on top of that , you can cover almost all the costs of your second home by renting when you 're not using it yourself . Fiord Haven will have a rental agency taking full-page ads in the Boston and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summer holidays . . . " Thatcher sighed and sipped his Scotch and water . This torrent of words , earnestly uttered by a bearded young man ? " Call me Burt " ? was not directed at him but at a silent couple whom Burt had cornered. " . . . and so you see , Oscar  --  you do n't mind if I call you Oscar , do you ? ? Fiord Haven is going to be a friendly community , as well as a real great place to get away from the rat race . . . " Thatcher edged away , leaving Oscar to his fate . He looked very much as if the fight had been knocked out of him . Mrs. Oscar was dazed . Burt was reaching for a contract form and suggestively brandishing a pen . " . . . variety of plans , " another persuasive voice inundated a cowed foursome . " You 've seen the James Joel Finley-de-  | signed lodge . That proves it . Fiord Haven will consist of show places . . . " Under the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form of social intercourse . He had however learned to cope with them with only minor vexation of spirit . Unfortunately , the lessons learned over many years were singularly inapplicable here in the Pine Cone Lounge . It was , for example , a practice of his to discharge his obligations by speaking briefly to the guest of honor or the host , then to blend into the background and let the ebb and now of guests camouflage discreet withdrawal . Furthermore , that withdrawal was as early as possible . At Fiord Haven 's party , his hosts were either closeted with the police or , alternatively , bent on selling him a half-acre lot . In addition , there was damned little ebb and flow ; most of the guests had been nailed down by voluble salesmen . And finally , he could not delude himself that he and Henry were susceptible to camouflage . Boots , whipcord pants , flannel shirts ? and in Henry 's case an ancient sweater of vaguely Oyster Bay provenance  --  all suggested that the management had hired them to provide local @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ police had been quite firm about that . So , instead of contentedly settling down in the Spartan surroundings of the Dunster Shelter to a meal made by adding water to a freeze-dried concentrate , he and Henry were doomed to the untimely comfort of two units at the White Mountains Motel , with inner spring mattresses , showers and other amenities . With roast beef and lobster to come . It was all highly unsatisfactory . " Strange setup , is n't it ? " Henry said . He was still indignant at both fate and the police but , being Henry , he was incapable of remaining uninterested in his surroundings . Psychologically speaking , Henry often reminded Thatcher of a beaver . He did not have a chance to ask if Henry was referring to Fiord Haven 's sales methods , or to the discovery of Steve  | Lester 's dead body at the main lodge which was being described as " the heart of Fiord Haven , where Havenites will enjoy an Olympic-size indoor swimming pool , a magnificent library , and a fun room for year-round @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man brightly . " Fm Gerry Wahl . You gentlemen just get here ? " " We are not part of your group , Mr. Wahl , " said Thatcher stoutly . But anything that lived and breathed was a potential sale to Gerry Wahl and Fiord Haven . Ignoring a lackluster response , as well as costumes that did not suggest year-round socializing in fun rooms , he rattled on : " . . . nine hundred and seventy-two of the most beautiful acres in New Hampshire , with one of the best ski areas ever developed . And a private bathing beach . . . " " But Mr. Thatcher is n't interested in buying a lot , are you , Mr. Thatcher ? " a youthful voice interrupted . " Mr. Thatcher is only here because ? " " Sukey ! " warned Alan Davidson . He then assumed an expression of extreme solemnity . Both the Davidsons had not only recovered from their misadventures , they had blossomed under them . " Oh yes , " said Sukey very guiltily . Smiling determinedly , Gerry Wahl ignored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bet you 're about ready to sign up , eh , Mr. Davidson ? " " Well now , " said Mr. Davidson , metaphorically drawing on a pipe . " Besides , " said Sukey , " we have n't seen this Fiord Lake . " " That 's because the access roads to the lake are n't in yet , Mrs. Davidson . Here , let me show you the photographs of the lake in our brochure . " He had hooked them neatly and just as neatly drew them away . Thatcher was amused . " That 's really quite a sales routine , " he observed to Henry . " Let-me-call-you-Oscar to the elderly , and Mr.-and-Mrs. to the very young . Nice touch . "  | Henry , too , had certain professional responses . " Wonder how they assembled this bunch . " " I understand they 're all from the Boston area . " That was not enough for a specialist in mailing lists . And now that Thatcher came to think of it , potential Havenites showed an unexpected range ; there were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , many more young parents all too obviously offspring-oriented , together with some newlyweds . " Home owners in the wealthier suburbs ? " he suggested . " I do n't think so , " Henry said . " Lester lived somewhere out in Weston , did n't he ? And the Davidsons seem to have an apartment in Cambridge . It 's probably one of those special lists ? you know , like subscribers to Life magazine , or owners of common stock . There 's Valenti . I 'll ask him . " " Looks as if he has other things on his mind , " Thatcher said watching Ralph Valenti smilingly circulate through the lounge with a non-stop flow of comment . " Hi there , Phil ! . . . sure is a beautiful building , is n't it ? . . . well , we want nothing but the best up here at Fiord Haven , and James Joel Finley is the best you can get . . . . evening , Mrs. Falks . . . did you and your husband like that site Burt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let him talk your ear off . . . . We want you to ask any questions you have . . . This practiced patter was delivered in a warm friendly voice that seemed to deprecate the insistence of Gerry , Burt , Barry , Walter and other young men . They , in turn , grinned dutifully , then resumed their pitch the minute Valenti had passed by . It was a good performance in itself , the more so since Thatcher guessed that Valenti 's partner , Eddie Quinlan , was still trying desperately to convince the police that murder should not be allowed to disrupt the Fiord Haven Fun Weekend . Valenti had a round hopeful face and a vague air of benevolence . He dropped very easily into a confidential tone of voice with Thatcher and Henry . " Terrible thing , " he said . " They 've told Mrs. Lester . Got hys-  | terical , poor woman . Eddie 's trying to calm her down . . . " He sounded more worried than sympathetic , and Thatcher could understand why . Stephen Lester @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good . But officially Fiord Haven , in the forms of Valenti and Quinlan , was doggedly optimistic . " The police will have this wrapped up within hours , " Valenti assured them . " Probably some psycho who got loose . . . " Thatcher kept a firm eye on Henry Morland . There was very little to be gained by pointing out that New Hampshire woodlands do not act as natural magnets for unbalanced personalities driven by irrational lusts to kill . If this was the line Valenti and Quinlan had decided to take , the New Hampshire State Police could be relied upon to provide a severe test of their salesmanship . " You 've got a remarkable merchandising operation here , " said Thatcher , to keep Henry from pursuing the topic . Valenti took this ambiguous observation as a compliment and brightened . " That 's just what I 'm saying tonight in my talk after dinner . It is a remarkable merchandising operation . That 's because Fiord Haven really is a remarkable place . " Here was a born salesman . Every time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not even John Thatcher , could doubt his sincerity . " We 're not peddling anything cheap or shoddy . Eddie and I decided that we 'd settle for nothing but the best . We could have gotten a lot of architects for less than James Joel Finley ? but no cutting corners for us . " " Quality always pays off , " Henry offered cunningly . " That 's right , " Valenti said , hailing a new truth . Thatcher would have preferred more facts and fewer homilies , but just then Eddie Quinlan joined them to sink wearily into a chair . " Whew ! I do n't want to go through that again , " he declared . " Amanda ? " Valenti asked .  | Quinlan nodded . It was a moment before he replied to his partner . " Of course , you ca n't help feeling sorry for the kid . She 's having hysterics . She does n't really know what she 's saying . " Valenti looked worried . " Who is she saying it to ? " " Who do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ police are getting an earful . " Valenti 's confidence needed reinforcement . " Eddie , " he shook his head , " I do n't like the sound of that at all . It could mean real trouble . " Quinlan shrugged . " There 's nothing much we can ? " He broke off , looking across the crowded room . " Oh , oh ! Maybe there is something we can do , Ralph . Look ! There 's another one of our problems . " There was an exchange of glances and the two men were making their apologies . As they moved away , Valenti called to a trim blond woman in her thirties : " Oh , Mrs. Lester . Do you have a minute ? " This was too much for Henry . " Did he say Mrs. Lester ? " he asked . " He did , " Thatcher replied cautiously . Henry was thinking , and that was always dangerous . " I thought he said Mrs. Lester was having hysterics in the office . " " She 's not only recovered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replied . " Tell me , Henry , how would you rate the likelihood of selling any of these people a lot here once they learn about the murder ? " Henry responded to the spirit of this rhetorical question . " Quinlan and Valenti are just keeping the machinery in working order . And Valenti may be right . If this gets cleared up fast ? well , people do have short memories . " Suddenly he narrowed his eyes at a tall man who had entered the lounge . " Who 's he ? And why 's he wearing those things ? " Henry did not regard hiking gear as a sartorial solecism . Jabots and velvet smoking jackets , however , were something else again .  | " That , " said Thatcher , " can only be James Joel Finley , the eminent architect . " If James Joel Finley was not an eminent architect , he was very much a great man . He accepted admiration from the ladies who crowded around him with a regal condescension . Lean , hawk-like , white-maned , he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had also a resonant voice . " . . . values . No , my dear Mrs. of nature . . . He had casually raised his voice so that he was addressing the entire room . " . . . fundamentals of honest design . In this kind of situation , the first thing we have to preserve is the organic unity . " They were going to get that lecture after all , Thatcher thought irately . He was wrong . James Joel Finley was in full flight when he suddenly realized that he had lost the rapt attention of much of his audience . With stately displeasure , he turned to the entrance behind him . There stood Captain Frewen . Beside him were two uniformed officers . Joining them was Eddie Quinlan . Without apology , he interrupted James Joel Finley and said , " Ladies and gentlemen . I 'm afraid that I have some bad news . . . " " Well , " said Henry in an undertone . " If this does nothing else , it will put an end to this selling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fiord Haven . " Temporarily , Henry . Temporarily . "  | IT WAS some hours before John Thatcher or anybody else saw that luxurious buffet with roast beef , lobster and other delicacies . Like the hour of sociability , it was not a howling success . The delay interjected by the news of Stephen Lester 's murder and the first round of police questioning had disheartened the chef : the roast beef was dry , the broiled lobsters were cold and the other delicacies were variously limp , sodden or scorched . Then , too , the human components showed signs of distress . Stephen Lester 's death may not have taken away all the appetites whetted by crisp New Hampshire air , but there was , Thatcher saw , a general feeling that hearty feeding would be in poor taste . Even those relentless automata , Fiord Haven 's salesmen , had been instructed to suspend operations for the time being . They were gathered into a group apart , far from the groaning board . At Fiord Haven , Thatcher would guess , every rib of beef @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was expected to produce sales results . The guests saw social awkwardness ; the staff saw waste . " Try one of the watermelon pickles , " Henry advised . " Not bad . " Thatcher took one . He and Henry , by virtue of their attire , were exempted from the prevailing atmosphere of genteel abstinence ; they were hearty outdoorsmen and , hence , trencher-41  | men . Insofar as he could , Thatcher proposed taking advantage of this . He joined Henry at their table and looked around the dining room . Most of those lining up for food looked sheepish . Those already seated pecked unhappily at their plates . He and Henry were certainly the only persons at ease in the dining room . Thatcher was not misled into confusing this mass discomfort with guilt . For , in the preceding hour , it had become fairly apparent that none of these unfortunates knew much about Stephen Lester , or his death . Or , he amended , if they did , they were successfully concealing the fact . " I 'm beginning to feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having none of that . " Frewen ! " he exclaimed , eviscerating a lobster ferociously . " Of all the stubborn , stiff-necked ? " Thatcher was used to Henry 's view of the universe . " Oh come on , Henry . You ca n't blame him for wanting to keep you here , at least until he checks you out . After all , you did discover the body . And you did know Lester . At the moment , that appears to be almost all the information poor Frewen 's got . " Henry downed knife and fork and looked balefully at his old friend . " In the first place , " he said , " it is technically impossible for me to have murdered Lester ? " " Of course . And as soon as Frewen confirms it with a medical report , he will allow us to move on , " Thatcher replied . " Unless , Henry , you are hiding a powerful motive for wanting Lester dead . " Henry ignored this . " Why focus upon the fact that I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man ? Why does Frewen detain us when endless possibilities leap to mind immediately ? " This elevated strain , Thatcher knew , was Henry telling the Supreme Court that The Pepper Mill might be small , but there were those who loved her . He tried to divert the Dan'l Webster across the table .  | " I wonder how soon he will let this whole Fiord Haven crowd go . " Henry was single-minded . " Of course , we do n't know what he learned from the wife  --  or that other woman . " " Mind if I join you ? " said a new voice . Eddie Quinlan stood before them , plate in hand . Thatcher and Henry invited him to sit down . Quinlan 's streak of self mockery was to the fore . " You 're the only two people in the room who do n't have anything to do with Fiord Haven , " he said frankly . " Right now , I can use that . " " Just the man I want to talk to , " Henry said alertly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Lester ? " Quinlan frowned . " Oh , there was some sort of foul-up in our mailing list . Too many of Lester 's women showed up . It 's the kind of mistake that should n't happen . " He did not sound very interested and Thatcher , if not Henry , could understand why . Quinlan was only marginally concerned with Stephen Lester . His energies were monopolized by Fiord Haven . And at the moment , Fiord Haven was in trouble . " . . . couple of sales , " Quinlan was saying . " Now they are n't sure they want to buy . Of course , I 've told everybody who signed a contract before this happened that we wo n't hold anybody against his will . But my God , does Frewen know how much damage he can do to us ? And what 's he got to show for it ? Not a damned thing ! I could have told him that . " Eddie Quinlan might want to sit with people who had nothing to do with Fiord Haven , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I told him it must have been a tramp , something like that . . . " " Frewen said there was no sign of robbery , " Henry pointed out . " Lester 's wallet had a couple of hundred dollars in it . And he was wearing an expensive watch . " Quinlan might have been seeing Henry for the first time . " You probably scared the murderer away , " he said . Again he was not much interested . Thatcher watched a white-hatted chef back through the  | swing doors from the kitchen with a tub of tossed salad . It was Quinlan who could not remain silent . " Whatever happened , " he said impatiently , " I wish we could convince Frewen that it does n't have anything to do with Fiord Haven . Otherwise , he 's going to cost us a fortune . It 's bad enough that we 've already lost one sale ? " Henry pounced . " Was Lester going to buy ? " he asked . " Yeah , " said Quinlan with that crooked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that  --  not when the guy got himself killed . But , God knows how many other sales it 's going to cost us if Frewen drags this thing out . . . " He looked around the dining room , gulped his coffee and jumped to his feet , saying something about talking to Valenti . It was more fundamental than that , Thatcher thought ; Eddie Quinlan was finding it hard to sit still . They watched him thread his way through the close-set tables , stopping here for a brief conversation , there for a word or two . " He may be right , " said Henry grudgingly . Obviously , anything as simple as a homicidal tramp held no appeal for him . " Give him the benefit of the doubt , " Thatcher urged . " For the moment at least . " Certainly it did not appear that Frewen and the police had unearthed any hard information in their questioning of Fiord Haven 's guests and personnel . Mr. and Mrs. Stephen Lester had arrived at the White Mountains Motel Friday evening . Lester @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He lived in a comfortable suburb outside Boston . Had anybody noticed anything unusual about him ? Captain Frewen had asked the room at large . Nobody had . Had anybody talked to him ? A lawyer from Haverhill cleared his throat . " I exchanged a few words with him this morning , " he said , flushing as he became the focus of many eyes .  | " What about ? " Frewen asked . The lawyer shrugged . " Oh , about how this was a pretty nice spot . And how the whole setup sounded pretty good . You know , just passing a few minutes until my wife got dressed . Oh , and maybe they should lay off the hard sell a little . . . " This ingenuous disclosure broke the ice of reticence ; it did not loose torrents of relevant information . Between Friday night and Saturday evening , when the body was discovered , Lester had exchanged desultory comments with many people . To a man , they agreed that there had been nothing significant about them . " Except @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when it turned out that Eunice Lester ? " She broke off delicately . Thatcher should have been warned by the gleam of interest in Henry 's eyes . This , it subsequently developed , was the point of no return . " We know all about that , " Frewen said curtly . " What we want from you , now , is a picture of how Lester spent his time . and how you did too . " In other words , the most interesting police interrogation was taking place elsewhere . And the account of that particular twenty-four hours , pieced together by nearly forty-five persons , was as garbled as might be expected . According to Burt , the salesman , Stephen Lester had attended the morning talk about land values at Fiord Haven aimed at the husbands . " He was real interested , " said Burt . " He saw the possibilities all right . . . " Burt continued in this vein for several minutes , momentarily forgetting that this was no occasion for a sales effort . Then Lester , with the rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not only available lots but the skeleton of James Joel Finley 's lodge . Frewen looked inquiringly at the architect . James Joel Finley did not object to being the focus of any number of eyes . Drawing dramatic brows together , he thought deeply .  | " No , " he said finally . " I 'm afraid that 1 ca n't place Mr. Lester particularly . Possibly I did speak to him . I did talk to several people about my design for the lodge which is a radical departure from conventional forms . But no , I do not particularly recall Lester . " Like Burt , James Joel Finley found it difficult to suspend operations . Lunch at the White Mountains Motel had brought together the Lesters and the Davidsons who had shared the table with them . " . . . yes . . . what did we talk about ? . . . Well , that 's hard to say . Mr. Lester was telling us all about New Hampshire . He knew a lot , did n't he , Sukey ? Then he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stand up to the New Hampshire winter . . . " After lunch , Lester had dropped by Eddie Quinlan 's office . Then , he set forth on a long , solitary walk , successfully evading an intensive session with Burt O'Neil . He returned to his motel unit , told his wife he was skipping the second tour , then set off alone again . And no one knew where he had gone . " Frewen will have his work cut out for him trying to check all that out , " Thatcher summarized . " After the second tour , people were either sitting in their motel rooms , or drifting aimlessly around  --  like the Davidsons . Most of the Fiord Haven staff , including Quinlan and Valenti were doublechecking plans for the evening program . The only hard-core alibis are for guests trapped by salesmen . " Henry was up and away . " Two women , " he said significantly . " Eunice and Amanda . " " Henry , " said Thatcher firmly . " No doubt the police are concentrating on any possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It 's the one strong lead there is . " " Leave it to them . " " What ? Oh , of course , of course , " said Henry . With cause , Thatcher was filled with deep foreboding .  | WHEN THATCHER emerged from his room the next morning the lawn was deserted except for the motel owner , hovering around the sprinkler system . He surveyed Thatcher without enthusiasm . " Your friend 's around someplace , " he said bitterly . " Stirring things up . " Thatcher was taken aback . Coolness he could understand . But why naked hostility ? The owner was now addressing a whirling jet of water . " They tell us tourism is the state 's biggest industry . But how do they expect us to attract tourists if people wo n't keep their mouths shut . Nobody wants to come someplace where they have murders . Hell , that 's what they 're trying to get away from . " " Nonsense , " said Thatcher crisply . " This is not a local secret . Since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hampshire must be talking about it . " Brute facts do not sway motel owners . This one said that , here at the White Mountains Motel  --  where they normally attracted a good class of customer  --  everyone just wanted to forget about it . He would have said a good deal more , but Thatcher resolutely marched off to the dining room . At the door he encountered the Davidsons , on their way out . " Hello , Mr. Thatcher . Mr. Morland 's already had breakfast , " Sukey greeted him . " He stopped by our table . He said he does n't see any 47  | reason why the police should suspect us , " Alan repeated faithfully . " Not now , when they know there are a lot of people here who had a real reason to kill Mr. Lester . " Henry must have been making himself popular in the dining room , Thatcher thought as he exchanged reassuring words with the young couple and passed inside . No doubt everyone within earshot had visualized Henry compiling a list of suspects . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to accommodate parties of five . At each table were two couples  --  and a salesman . Incredibly the murder seemed to have made no difference . Blueprints , brochures and sales contracts were again in evidence everywhere . Thatcher had no intention of exposing himself to yet another spiel about Fiord Haven . As he was edging toward a deserted table in the far corner , he was hailed . " Mr. Thatcher ! " boomed a mellifluous voice . " Wo n't you join us ? " James Joel Finley had risen to his feet and was indicating a chair . Resignedly Thatcher strode forward and acknowledged an introduction to Burt O'Neil . Finley beckoned a waitress with lordly assurance . Yesterday evening the distinguished architect had had no time for two strangers in dusty boots and flannel shirts . Since then his intelligence system had been at work . James Joel Finley was not the man to dissimulate . " Mr. Morland was telling us that you are a senior vice president at the Sloan Guaranty Trust . Now I find that truly interesting . " Thatcher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ architect flowed smoothly on . " Many people might be surprised to find you in these surroundings , but not I. It is a very good example of what I was explaining to our guests only the other night . As a man rises to the pinnacle of his profession , as his responsibilities and his material rewards increase , he feels a need to return to fundamentals . Can it be that our modern urban environment cuts him off from a life-sustain-  | ing force ? I refer , of course , to the nourishment derived from the organic union of man , habitat , and nature . This , I shall always maintain , must be the prime goal of modern architecture . " " Just so , " Thatcher murmured , watching his melon rind disappear , to be replaced by a steaming platter of ham and eggs . " Ah ! You understand . I understand . But how many do not understand ? " Finley grieved . " Too often , far too often , those who do not understand  --  one might even say those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frustrate the dreams of those who do . " Burt O'Neil was puzzled . John Thatcher was not . He was familiar with Finley 's attempts to obtain financial backing for a revolutionary housing development in California . The whole colony , green belts and all , was to have been suspended on pilings over the Pacific Ocean . The reaction of the building in- IV spector to this vision climaxed the favorite after-dinner story of many West Coast bankers . No one denied that the view would have been incomparable . " Indeed , " Thatcher said sedately , pouring himself more coffee . " And that is why it is doubly satisfactory to meet a man in your position , who obviously values the integration of man and situs . " Thatcher was tempted and fell . " Of course , such integration does not present much of a problem in a shelter on the Appalachian Trail . " Belatedly Finley realized that the union of man and nature could be pressed too far  --  to the point where residential housing was dispensed with entirely . While he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the conversation . " There are the police . " He gestured toward the driveway beyond the window . " They 're bringing back Mrs. Lester . " James Joel Finley became avuncular . " Poor , poor child . "  | He shook his white mane sadly . " So young for so much sorrow . Who would have thought , seeing her full of high spirits yesterday , that fate had this blow in store for her ? " Curious , Thatcher turned to look out the window . A state trooper was helping a woman alight from the car . As she stepped into full sunlight , she was revealed as little more than a girl , tall , slim and auburn-haired . Meanwhile , Burt took issue with Finley . " You 're thinking of Friday , when she came , Mr. Finley . That was before she found out about Eunice . Yesterday , Amanda was mad as hell . " Thatcher did not normally pursue leads like this . But after all , he thought , by now Henry certainly knew about Lester 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too . " Is that Mrs. Lester ? That girl ? " he asked . " Then who was the Mrs. Lester having cocktails last night ? " " It is difficult , extremely difficult , " ? Finley 's displeasure was Augustan ? " to counsel a recreation colony whose sales force does not display elementary competence . " O'Neil was more responsive . " Amanda is the one who 's married to Lester now . Or , anyway , she was until yesterday . The blond woman , that 's Eunice , is his ex-wife . Did n't Mr. Morland tell you ? He could n't talk about anything else at breakfast . " All was clear now . No wonder the Davidsons had mentioned other suspects . Whom else had Henry been chatting with ? " I have n't seen Morland this morning , " Thatcher remarked . " It was a big surprise to him . Hell , it was a big surprise to us , too , " O'Neil replied with conviction . " Nobody knew anything about it until dinner , Friday night . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the fat was in the fire . " Finley folded his napkin with mathematical precision . " I should have thought that anyone compiling the list for this weekend would have noticed the presence of two Mrs. Stephen Lesters . " " I do n't know about lists , " said O'Neil heatedly , " but I do  | know it put me in a helluva spot . The minute they cottoned on , Eunice said she would n't buy if the Lesters did , and Amanda said they would n't buy if Eunice did . And management expects me to sell prospects like that ! " Thatcher reached for his final piece of toast . " Your problem seems to have solved itself , " he pointed out . " With Stephen Lester dead , there is only one candidate left in the field . " Burt O'Neil was not sidetracked . High-pressure salesmen seldom are . Instead he produced further evidence that Henry was spreading sunshine with fine impartiality . " That 's what Mr. Morland said . He thought the police might even consider it a motive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't have one candidate left . I 've got none ! " " How does that follow ? " Thatcher asked . He did not suppose that O'Neil considered the murder of an ex-husband enough to diminish the attraction of a choice lot . O'Neil lowered his voice before continuing . " Well , last night when the cops pulled up , you know they wanted to keep things quiet at first . They got Amanda out to the office and broke the news to her . Then they asked if anybody else was connected with Lester . So Mr. Quinlan told them about Eunice . She was in here having cocktails with the rest of us , so the troopers went over to her room . You know what they found ? " James Joel Finley was not above human curiosity . " What ? " he breathed softly . " Her things were all packed up . She 'd been planning to hightail it out of here without anyone knowing . You can see how that looks . " Under the circumstances Thatcher was not surprised to find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conversation by the deserted swimming pool . One was the blond woman of yesterday evening . The other , naturally , was Henry Morland . " John , come on over . " Henry 's face lighted with innocent pleasure . " We 're talking about the murder . Eunice , this is John Thatcher , who 's hiking with me . John , this is Mrs. . . . "  | For once , sheer gusto was not enough to take Henry over the top of social difficulty . Eunice Lester smiled ruefully . " I 'm the first Mrs. Lester , Mr. Thatcher , " she said , shaking hands . " Not the Number-One widow . " " How do you do ? " Thatcher seated himself on a redwood chair . Eunice shook a cigarette out of a small gold case and accepted a light . " Henry and I have been talking about Steve . " This was exactly what Thatcher had feared . Did Eunice realize that Henry was busy compiling a list of murder suspects ? Or did n't she care ? Perhaps she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regret . " I told Eunice that I 'd met Steve at the club , " Henry explained , " and that took her back . " He at least was at ease in his double role as confidant and detective . " Way back , " Eunice said , meditatively watching cigarette smoke . " When Steve and I were married , he was a student and he was always going off to the Trail with the Outing Club . But that was over ten years ago . And now look " ? she gestured hopelessly ? " Steve is dead and I 'm a murder suspect . " " For that matter , so am I , " said Henry . " But you 'll see , things will straighten themselves out . You 've already explained that business about being packed up and ready to leave . " Eunice shook her head . " There 's no point being foolishly optimistic . I 've explained to them that , as soon as I found out Steve had bought a lot , I was through . It was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told him that the minute Steve bought , I was going back to Boston . " " That sounds reasonable , " Thatcher said . Eunice Lester smiled humorlessly . " Sure  --  until Amanda claimed I was lying . She did her best to make me look suspicious by saying that Steve had n't bought a lot . She claims I made up an excuse on the spur of the moment . " Henry 's good cheer diminished . " I did n't realize she was denying it . Then it 's just your word against hers ? " Eunice laughed bitterly . " Oh no . For once luck was on my  | side . The police talked to Eddie Quinlan before Amanda was through with her hysterics . He told them Steve had agreed to buy lot seventy-three yesterday afternoon  --  which is exactly what I told them . So all Amanda 's little game accomplished was to make the police think twice about believing a word that little bitch says . " " Now , now . " Henry was pained by this reference to the youthful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night . Either she did n't know what she was saying , or Steve had n't told her about the sale yet . There 's no need to think she was deliberately trying to get you into trouble . " " You can afford to be charitable . I ca n't . " Eunice 's jaw hardened . " When the police check back , they 'll find out that you had nothing to do with Steve , no reason to , murder him . When they check back on me , they 'll find plenty . And most of it is Amanda 's fault . " Thatcher was torn between courtesy and curiosity . Happily Henry was always more alive to the second . " Eunice and Steve were having a custody dispute , " he explained tactfully . " About their son . " " My son , " Eunice corrected him shortly . " Steve 's connection with Tommy was a biological accident . " Thatcher reviewed the various altercations which could arise between ex-spouses . In his experience nothing approached the viciousness of a savagely-contested custody battle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ physical abuse paled in comparison . " Is the suit in progress now ? " he asked . " It started last winter . And do you know why ? " Eunice was deriving satisfaction from her recital . " Because Amanda ca n't have children , that 's why ! Steve has been playing the gay manabout-town since he walked out on me . Having himself a ball in San Francisco , while I brought up Tommy . Then , a couple of years ago , he decided it was time to settle down . So he married Amanda and they had a great time being a swinging young couple . Finally they decided to come back East and start  | family life . They built themselves a house in a fancy suburb , and Steve got to be in charge of the New England territory for his company . Everything was going along as if they were color advertisements in a magazine . Then the blow fell . No children . So what does Steve do ? After ten years , he suddenly remembers he has a son and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little Amanda thinks that 's a wonderful idea . " The outburst came to a sudden halt . Eunice was breathing hard and her face had gone white . She looked years older . Henry was quick with his sympathy . " That must have been a terrible shock for you . And I can understand why you do n't see much good in Amanda . But , after all , could Steve have gotten away with it ? No court would give him custody , not after you 'd had to bring up the boy alone . " A bleak smile of gratitude appeared on Eunice 's face . Impulsively she leaned forward and squeezed Henry 's hand . " You 're a nice man , Henry . Too nice to realize the tricks that a Steve Lester could get up to . " Like most men , Henry did not welcome the view that he was too wholesome to comprehend the depravities which were an open book to his female companion . " I admit that I did n't know Steve well . I did n't know anything about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he did n't strike me as up to anything special . I do n't mean his morals . I mean his intelligence . " Eunice took him up instantly . " It did n't take intelligence . Just a single-minded idea of what he wanted and no compunctions about how he got it . He found out I am getting married this fall . So , he hired detectives to dig into my past . I 've been divorced for over ten years . He did n't have to be a genius to figure out that there would be something he could use . In his own simple way Steve thought if he threatened a really nasty fight over my morals , I 'd be scared out of court . " After a brief tribute to the depth of Eunice 's feelings , Henry ventured : " He had you in a bind , did n't he ? "  | Eunice 's eyes flamed at emotions recalled . " Not the way he thought he did . I did n't work and sweat to raise Tommy to lose him to that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the start . I was n't giving Tommy up , no matter what . I decided something else , too . I 'd already let Steve Lester ruin too many years of my life . I was n't giving up my marriage to Peter either . " She looked at them challengingly . " The police will find all this out . They 'll say that this murder was how I managed to keep Tommy . They 're wrong . I do n't know who killed Steve or why . But I know one thing . " " Now there 's no reason to think they 'll say that , " Henry began half-heartedly . Eunice rode right over him . " Dead or alive , Steve is n't standing in my way any more . I 'm going to have Tommy and Peter both . And nothing is stopping me ! " Her voice rang clearly through the still air . But even before its throbbing became an echo , Thatcher heard something beyond defiance . He heard fear .  | THE TORTURED complexities of the human spirit are , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk endlessly about themselves . With very little encouragement , they will talk just as much about their friends . They will even pay good money to plumb the depths of the human condition in total strangers  --  as witness , the Living Theater , the cinema verite , and the nonfiction novel . Such explorations are variously regarded as : palliative , recreational , liberating , or compulsory . Whatever the rationale , many people relish the process of peeling layer after layer to come to essence . Human essence being what it is , John Putnam Thatcher was not among their number . Normally he thoroughly enjoyed his vacations from Wall Street , but this one was proving the exception . Fiord Haven 's sales mill he could take in stride , for short periods at least . But he could not enjoy witnessing Eunice Lester 's unhappiness . And worse was sure to come . Never had the Sloan Guaranty Trust looked so inviting . Not that the trust department was unnaturally harmonious . There was . for example , the unceasing guerrilla warfare between Everett Gabler and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learn that , from the rugged north , he had been instrumental in effecting an armed truce between these ancient adversaries . " What did they want to know ? " Everett Gabler sputtered . An ad hoc committee was in session around Miss Corsa 's  | desk , composed of Charlie Trinkam , Walter Bowman from Research , and Everett , himself . Miss Corsa was on the firing line . " They only wanted to know how long Mr. Thatcher has worked for the bank , and when he left for his vacation , " she replied . " And when he is expected back . " " Good God ! " said Walter . " But Rose , " Charlie expostulated , " did n't you even ask why they wanted to know ? " He broke off , defeated by her look . If , that look said , Miss Corsa were going to go around asking questions , she could start closer to home . It was all very unfortunate . Through some sort of administrative lapse , the New York Police Department , cooperating with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dispatched two uniformed officers to the Sloan and to Thatcher 's secretary . The officers had put their questions briefly , received precise replies , and departed . Both they and Miss Corsa had been able to remain unexcited . Not so the rest of the trust department . Mounted Cossacks charging down the corridor could scarcely have roused greater response . Thatcher , whether physically on the premises or not , was a presence much felt in the trust department , and indeed throughout the Sloan . As a result , everybody felt proprietary interest in his comings and goings . A reference to him in The Wall Street Journal was comment-worthy from Brooklyn Heights to Westport . A quote in Time magazine kept the staff buzzing for days . A policeman left Thatcher 's subordinates burning with curiosity . Except Miss Corsa , that is . " You do n't think John is in any difficulties , do you ? " Charlie asked the world at large . " No , I do not , " Miss Corsa replied coldly . There were times when Mr. Thatcher did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to put up with this sort of thing . " How could he get into difficulties on the Appalachian Trail ? " Walter Bowman asked . " Unless he fell off , of course . "  | " You 're thinking of Mount Everest , Walter , " said Charlie absently . " John has n't been hurt , has he , Rose ? " " No , " she said . Clearly more was needed . " There has been some sort of accident . Mr. Thatcher and Mr. Morland were witnesses , that is all . The police just wanted ? " " An alibi ! " Walter Bowman exploded . His great bulk precluded much familiarity with mountaineering , rock scrambles or cross-country hikes , but he knew all about police routine . " Certainly not , " said Miss Corsa , again affronted . But Everett Gabler , as usual , had been thinking critically along more specific lines . He came to a sharp-witted conclusion before Charlie and Walter did . " So , John is n't on the trail now . That means that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Corsa admitted this was true . " Aha ! " It was triumph . The confrontation triggered by the State Banking Commission had not abated one whit . But Trinkam realized that prying further information out of Miss Corsa would be no small task . Misguidedly , he appealed to her softer side . " I do n't like the sound of this police business , Rose . Walter 's right . John may need us . Perhaps we should ring him up to see if we can help . . . He had gone too far . " If Mr. Thatcher is in any need of us , " Miss Corsa announced , " he will no doubt call us . Now , I am afraid I must finish this report . " Even this dismissal did not terminate the entente . " That , " said Everett , giving credit where credit was due , " was a good effort , Charlie . " Charlie recognized generosity . " Thanks , Ev , " he replied sincerely . To the north , no such meeting of minds obtained . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Henry in a peppy voice . " Are n't you interested in all of this ? "  | Henry was ominously full of frisk . Thatcher admitted mild interest in Stephen Lester 's murder . This was not enough for Henry , who glared out the window of the car taking them to the State Police barracks and formal statements that would signal  --  Thatcher hoped  --  the end of their involvement with Stephen Lester and Fiord Haven . If he could keep the lid on Henry . " Put it this way , " said Henry finally . " I 'm a suspect , you know . Ca n't blame the police for suspecting me , but you ca n't blame me for wanting to know who did Lester in ? " " Henry , " said Thatcher wearily , " you are not a suspect , as you yourself were insisting last night . I understand you feel sorry for Eunice Lester ? " But Henry did not accept easy outs . " Of course I 'm a suspect , " he said proudly . " I knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time to knock him over the head . . . " How , Thatcher wondered , had that admirable woman , Ruth Morland , managed to endure her husband these many years ? More to the point , what was their police driver making of this ? " Here we are , " said Henry , all anticipation . The barracks of the New Hampshire State Police was a small , utilitarian crackerbox on Route 12 . It was not set up for the rapid processing of large numbers of people . For that matter , the staff of Barracks Four , even augmented by additional personnel , was not able to handle the number of witnesses involved . Top-level efforts were being reserved for the two Mrs. Lesters . Routine interviews with thirty assorted potential Havenites were continuing at the White Mountains Motel . Furthermore , since Stephen Lester 's body had come to light at the site of James Joel Finley 's lodge , it was necessary to talk to an entire construction crew . So when Morland and Thatcher entered the barracks , they found that they would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the waiting room , were a baker 's dozen of construction workers . After a brief lull , the conversation resumed .  | " One damned delay after another , " said a middle-aged man with small eyes and sinewy arms . " Now this . " There was a murmur of agreement . " You figure this killing will hold things up more , Alec ? " Alec was clearly the man in charge . He shrugged . " This guy Finley 's planning big changes after the foundation 's already in . What can make for more delay than that ? Even if this guy , Lester , was n't killed down at the job , we 've still got six or seven days of sitting on our hands . Big brain , our architect . I 'll hand him that . " Alec , Thatcher saw , was not included among James Joel Finley 's admirers . But if Thatcher was the man to settle back and listen , Henry was not . " Alec Prohack , " he said , bounding up to shake hands vigorously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It developed that Alec Prohack had bossed the crew that built Henry 's new warehouse some years ago . " Mr. Morland , " he said enthusiastically . Not to Thatcher 's surprise , Henry Morland was absolutely at home with Alec and the rest of the boys . A vague gesture toward Thatcher was introduction enough . Predictably , Henry felt free to ask questions . " Did n't know you were working over at Fiord Haven , " he said . There was a low , meaningful silence , the sort that leads all city people to expatiate on the subject of taciturn Yankees . Thatcher knew better . Alec and the gnarled , brown , tough men with him were sharing a joke . A monkey-faced oldster put it into words : " We 're following orders , " he said slyly . Somebody guffawed . " That 's right , " said Alec Prohack gravely . " We follow orders . They got big plans up there , those fellows do . " " Smart , those fellows , " said Monkey Face , no doubt the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joke . The most youthful member of Alec Prohack 's crew played straight man . " Big businessmen , " he said in mock admiration . " Come here from Boston . They do things different , in Boston . " " Yup , " said an elderly man . Now , tourists from Brooklyn may take these yups at face value . But Alec Prohack and his men were indulging themselves . Whatever this signified , Thatcher did not think it was deep respect for Fiord Haven . There was , of course , the usual small-town attitude toward outsiders . There might be something else . The door from the inner office opened . Eddie Quinlan was ushered out by a trooper . The trooper , too , was a local man . " Alec , you and the boys do n't mind if Lieutenant Barteau takes Mr. Morland and Mr. Thatcher first , do you ? " " Go on , " said Alec largely . " Besides , we 've got all the time in the world . " As Henry disappeared behind closed doors to deliver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yet even Ruth Morland had often conceded that no one could really protect Henry from himself . Fortunately , Thatcher 's attention was reclaimed . Quinlan showed no disposition to hurry back to the White Mountains Motel . " I 'm sorry you 've gotten tied up by all this , Mr. Thatcher . I still maintain that some nut must have done it . The police will probably catch up with him down in Nashua . . . " " Maybe Boston , even , " said Monkey Face . Eddie Quinlan nodded , missing the irony . " Yeah , he could be almost anywhere , " he said . Thatcher returned a noncommittal reply , meanwhile registering that Quinlan , amidst his other preoccupations , had learned who John Putnam Thatcher was . Today there was a slight deference in his manner that was directed to the Wall Street banker , not the Appalachian Trail hiker.  | Quinlan belatedly recognized Prohack and his crew . " They interviewing you too , Alec ? " he asked with a friendly grin . Alec said that they were . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " They 're being damned thorough , I 'll give them that . They 're interviewing every single one of the guests , too . I suppose they 're checking you guys out because Lester 's body was found up at the site . You never even met him . " Quinlan 's husky Boston voice was encouraging . But , Thatcher sensed , Alec and his friends did not need encouragement . There was n't an ounce of tension in the whole crew . Prohack , meanwhile , took his time . " Well now , " he finally drawled , " what makes you think that ? " Quinlan was surprised . " But Alec , we break our necks to keep the customers from getting under your feet . You 're the one who insisted on it . " Prohack nodded . " Sure . But this Lester must have wandered off the beaten track . One or two of them always do . The rest of you were at the buildings when he turned up at our trailer , just when we were quitting for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But , Alec , that could be important ! My God , that was only an hour or so before he got killed . How did he act ? What did he say ? " Alec shrugged . " He acted like everybody else who 's bought a lot . All steamed up about when everything would be ready . Roads , the ski trails , the tows . How were we going to develop the beach ? Hell , the longer he looked at the plans , the more questions he asked . You know , once they 've bought themselves a lot , most of your buyers forget that they 've still got a house to build . " What a shame , Thatcher thought , that Henry was not here for this confirmation of Eunice Lester 's story .  | Quinlan , however , had been reminded of another problem . " How long is this going to put us back ? " he asked , not masking his worry . Alec crossed brawny arms . " Depends on what changes Finley 's got in mind , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleek hair . Alec and the crew watched stolidly . " Well , " Quinlan said , " I guess we 'll just have to take things the way they come . " Not a bad philosophy , Thatcher decided , when five minutes later a crestfallen Henry reappeared .  | HENRY 'S DEJECTION was explained when Thatcher succeeded him in Lieutenant Barteau 's office . Together with the other luckless guests of Fiord Haven , they were requested to remain at the White Mountains Motel for at least a short time . " My impression , Henry , was that you found this whole mess more interesting than hiking , " said Thatcher , to dam a flow of complaint . This provoked Henry into an impassioned declamation . He was unalterably devoted to the Appalachian Trail , but he retained the normal man 's interest in the passing parade , particularly if it incorporated an unsolved murder . Henry was not as contradictory as he sounded , Thatcher reflected during this spate of eloquence . His slight person camouflaged a gargantuan zest for living ; a burning commitment to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stephen Lester and his affairs . Henry had switched from volubility to portentousness . He narrowed his eyes . " Boston , " he said heavily . Oh God , thought Thatcher . Henry had another idea . The New Hampshire State Police had had the same idea earlier . Already reports were pouring in from Boston , from Weston , Massachusetts , and for that matter from California . Not that they were particularly informative . A preliminary survey showed that everyone was what he claimed to be . There were no criminal convictions , there were no undesirable associates , there were no official bankruptcies.  | Stephen Lester , aged thirty-five , was a resident of Weston , and the owner of a home and two cars . He was employed as sales manager by North American Chemical Company . His wife , Amanda Trainor Lester , was aged twenty-six . There were no children . James Joel Finley , aged fifty , member of the American Institute of Architects , was a partner of Finley &; Ching , in Carmel , California . Finley &; Ching were the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Lawrence Library of Taos Community College , Taos , New Mexico , and the Pineapple Pavilion in Honolulu . Finley was currently separated from his fourth wife . Particulars would follow as available . Arlington , Massachusetts , reported that Eunice Lester , aged thirty-four , was a divorcee with one son , employed as a personnel manager in a Boston department store . " It 's a sure thing that anything interesting about the wives is n't coming up on a police wire , " said Frewen , tossing papers aside . " What 's Boston got to offer ? " " Quinlan and Valenti , " Barteau replied . But Boston was not much more helpful . Edward J. Quinlan , the teletype informed New Hampshire , was a Boston lawyer aged thirty-five , who had been active in real estate for ten years . Ralph G. Valenti , aged thirty-eight , had joined him four years ago . Together they had developed River Estates , a garden apartment complex in the Jamaicaway , before launching Fiord Haven . Both men were married . Each had two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everybody else associated with Fiord Haven were just as useless . Gerry Wahl , Burt O'Neil , the young Davidsons , all added up , as Frewen said , " To one big fat zero . " He slammed his hand on the desk . " No reason , on the face of it , for any of them to kill Lester . " " You do n't buy the wives , either ? " Barteau asked . " Right now they 're the best bet , " Frewen replied . " Especially the ex . " He broke off . Eunice Lester 's life , home and activities were due for more stringent examination . Her fiance  | would be investigated as well . Currently , Frewen was withholding judgment . " But I still ca n't figure out why the wives would come up here to kill Lester . Hell , it 's a lot safer down there . " This libel on the Commonwealth of Massachusetts roused no objection from Barteau . " So , it all boils down to nothing , " Frewen continued . " Lester @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , afterwards , he hangs around for a little while , closes his deal with Quinlan , runs into the ex-wife and tells her about it . Then he goes for a walk , promising his wife he 'll be back in time to tour the site with her . He does come back but now he tells her he 's skipping the tour . And after that , the only people who see him are the construction crew , just before they quit work . From what Prohack says , Lester was avoiding the whole Fiord Haven crowd . " " And what does the wife say ? " Barteau asked . Frewen stubbed out his cigar , recalling the hysterics , the doctor , and the sedatives that had stood between him and Amanda Lester . But that was forty-eight hours ago . " Let 's go and find out , " he said . . . sure , sure , use our office , " said Ralph Valenti , appropriately solemn . Behind him , Mrs. Lester had tucked herself into the corner of the leather sofa . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her shoulders as if an act of will could dissipate her bewilderment . Her ordeal had left her pale and drawn but , for the first time , Frewen realized that Amanda Lester was a little beauty , graceful as a doe with the same fine bones and enormous eyes . " Yes , of course I want to help you , " she said in a voice that was low but perfectly steady . " I 'd rather have Mr. Valenti and Mr. Quinlan stay with me , though . My parents have n't gotten in from California yet . They 're coming tonight . " Captain Frewen was not an imaginative man but the contrast  | between Stephen Lester 's two wives was striking enough to capture him . Eunice Lester fought her own battles . Amanda Lester had gone from being somebody 's daughter to some-body 's wife ; her husband 's death had left her alone but she did not know it . Instinctively , she expected supporters . It had not occurred to her that she might need defenders . The same examination being trained on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extended to Mrs. Amanda Lester , housewife . Eunice , Frewen suspected , knew this . Amanda did not . Quinlan cocked an inquiring eye at the policeman . " Sure , we 'll stay if it makes you feel better , Mrs. Lester , " he said . " That is , if it 's all right with you , Captain ? " " Sure , " said Frewen , grimly amused . Amanda did not think of herself as a suspect ; neither did she think of Eddie Quinlan or Ralph Valenti as suspects . Frewen knew why . The hysteria of Saturday night was gone ; the accusation remained . " Has Eunice confessed ? " Amanda asked in a matter-of-fact voice , before the men were seated . Quinlan and Valenti froze , but she paid no attention . Frewen cleared his throat . " No , she has n't confessed , Mrs. Lester . And we do n't have any evidence ? " " For God 's sake , what have you been doing ? " Amanda exclaimed . " Everybody knows she did it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ muttered protest . " We all know what happened . She hated Steve . She had a fight with him . Then ? " Amanda was still seeing things in black and white . Eunice Lester hated Steve . Steve was dead . Therefore . . . While Frewen concentrated on framing his first question , Eddie and Ralph avoided Amanda 's eyes . She swept on : " You ca n't deny that they met each other after lunch . Eunice admits it herself . Then she trumped up this story about Steve buying a lot . " Almost apologetically , Quinlan hitched himself forward . " Now , Mrs. Lester , I think that there 's some sort of confusion  | here . When I spoke to your husband after lunch , he did make up his mind to buy . I was going to have a sales contract ready Sunday . Probably he bumped into Eunice and was just being polite ? " Indignation brought color to Amanda 's cheeks . " Polite ? Does that sound likely ? For heaven 's sake , Eunice could n't see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Saturday morning . Imagine what it would have been like if I had n't been there . " If life was a stage for Amanda Lester , she was the star in every scene . Other people had witnessed the Lesters ' meeting on Saturday . Everyone agreed that it had been unpleasant . Not everyone , however , cast Amanda as the peacemaker . " Okay , Mrs. Lester , " Frewen said soothingly . " Have it your way . Your husband fought with his ex-wife before he set out on his walk . But what did he do after that ? He was gone the whole afternoon . He must have said something to you when he stopped back in your motel room . " Amanda Lester did not like being humored . Stiffly she said , " He simply said he was not coming on the tour . " " Did he say why ? " " No , he did n't . " " Did n't you ask ? " " No , I did not . " Almost imperceptibly , the atmosphere in the room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Quinlan , and Frewen were all married men . Not one of them believed her . " All right , " said Frewen . " He skipped out on you for the first half of the afternoon . He skipped out on you for the second half . You did n't ask him where he was going . Did you ask when he was coming back ? " " No , " she cried out . But three skeptical faces made her falter for the first time . " Well , if you must know , he was . . . he was preoccupied . " Inwardly , Frewen relaxed . So Steve Lester had had something on his mind other than one of Fiord Haven 's vacation homes .  | " What was he preoccupied about ? " he demanded . " He did n't tell me , " Amanda replied almost desperately . " He would n't explain anything . He just snapped at me , then he stamped out . " " Now Mrs. Lester , do n't get upset , " Valenti murmured uselessly . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm mad . Why are you wasting time this way ! Why are you hounding me when you know that Eunice had a fight with Steve ? She 's the one you should be going after ? " Captain Frewen 's long temper had limits . " Look , Mrs. Lester . Eunice may have had a fight with your husband at two o'clock . You sure as hell had one at four . And by six , he was dead ! " First she gasped at him , then she leaped to her feet , her hands clenched . " You ca n't talk to me that way and I 'm not staying to hear any more ! You do n't see me again until I 've got my father on one side and a lawyer on the other . " Head high , she marched out of the office . Frewen made no move to stop her . Quinlan turned his crooked grin on Frewen . " Listen , Captain , I 've got a complaint , too . Why the hell did you let us in for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of mournful reproach . " Do you both good , " Frewen said robustly . " And as long as I 've got you here , I 've got a couple of questions for you . " " We 'll make a deal , " Quinlan said easily . " We answer your questions and you call off the cops . Let these people we 've got on our hands go home . We 're running up a helluva motel bill . " " That does n't bother me , " said Frewen . " The owner 's my nephew . Now listen , what do either of you know about this scene when the Lesters ran into Eunice for the first time ' ? " Quinlan shrugged as Valenti replied , " Neither of us were there , thank God . Ask James Joel Finley for a blow-by-blow account . He told me all about it . "  | " Most of the salesmen can do the same , Ralph , " Quinlan reminded him . " Frankly I got the impression that it was the women who made most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lester was more embarrassed than anything else . " That figured , everybody agreed . " Another thing , " Frewen said , rising to leave . " I know how you ride herd on the prospects you get up here . Why were n't you keeping tabs on Lester ? If you 'd been doing your job , mine would be a lot easier . Did n't anybody notice how he was ducking most of these sales pitches of yours ? " Neither Quinlan nor Valenti was affronted . Valenti in fact took the question seriously . " I 'm the one who goofed on that . Somebody told me that Lester was missing around three o'clock . That 's it , Burt O'Neil told me he had cut the talk session ? " Quinlan broke in as he , too , rose . He was more lighthearted . " I guess you and Burt did n't know that we 'd already sold Lester , Ralph . " He turned to Frewen . " Captain , once they 've signed up , they can go visit their grandmothers if they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " In that case , it 's a shame Lester decided to buy , " Frewen mused . " The real shame , " Valenti said bitterly , " was that he ever got on our list . " Frewen was speaking more to himself than to the others . " I guess there is n't much more to do here . " Quinlan picked him up . " You mean we can let everybody goT ? That was exactly what Captain Frewen meant . " It is n't as if we have much chance to make any sales now , " Valenti remarked as he retailed the scene to Thatcher and Henry . They were sitting in the lobby of the White Mountains Motel . Around them was a purposive bustle , as Fiord Haven 's prospects got out while the going was good . The packsacks under Thatcher 's chair contrasted strongly to the matched sets p 71 of luggage piled everywhere . Their message however was comparable ; everybody was packed and eager to escape . Henry had not been listening . " I 've never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , returning from a reconnaissance of the driveway . " Everybody here seems to drive one . " He lost Thatcher but not Valenti . " That 's right , " Valenti said . " Eddie 's got a nephew in the Registry of Motor Vehicles . We got a list of Porsche owners in the Greater Boston area . That gives you a pretty good list of prospects , do n't you think ? Real smart idea  --  until all this popped up . Eddie 's got a million ideas like that . " The explosion of departing exhausts momentarily deflected him . But only momentarily : " Next weekend , we 've got thirty medical doctors coming up . That 's even better than Porsches . If we do n't sell twenty to thirty lots  --  well , I 'll be surprised . " Thatcher felt his way . " Your sales program is . . . er . continuing ? " Valenti was disingenuous . " Why not ? This will blow over . " Neither Thatcher nor Henry found any suitable reply . Their silence spurred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked around the crowded lobby . " But I 'll tell you one thing , " he said in a savage undertone . " I wish I 'd been the one to find Lester 's body . " " I do , too , " said Henry , who seemed to have taken a dislike to Valenti . Thatcher waited . " Because if I had , I 'd have rolled it down a mountainside , that 's what I 'd have done . Then everybody would have thought Lester had some sort of accident . And that would have been that . " " Except for a murderer on the loose , " Thatcher objected . Unheeding , Valenti continued : " It was just more lousy luck . Any other Saturday , I 'd probably have been up at the site . This time I had to see about getting some blueprints changed . "  | A horn from the driveway brought an end to these revelations . " Well , good luck , " said Henry , smartly hoisting his pack . It was an abrupt withdrawal from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good wishes , then followed Henry from the motel . As they left , Ralph G. Valenti was still thinking hard .  | JOHN THATCHER had not expected to be back at the Morland home in Pepperton , New Hampshire within four days of leaving it . Nevertheless , he viewed his surroundings with approval . He had always been an admirer of this kitchen . Like most women swapping New York City for Northern New England , Ruth Morland had demanded a modern kitchen . She had resisted the temptation to encase the electric range in a stoveblack exterior , to surround the freezer with knotty pine paneling and to cover the vinyl floor with braided rugs . On the contrary , the only reminder of the original kitchen  --  a wood and oil range prudently preserved as insurance against electric failure  --  was concealed in a niche behind folding doors . As a result , Ruth had a genuine farmhouse kitchen . Only city people live in a sea of cranberry scoops and scorn formica and stainless steel . The breakfast nook , in a similar move toward comfort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the morning sun was now pouring . Thatcher eased his shoulders in a shaft of warmth and contemplated his hostess . Henry , busy as a beaver , had already bustled off to his warehouse . This was a golden opportunity for a few words of warning . Happily , Ruth had few illusions about her husband . " I 'm surprised you were able to get him back here , John , " she said , putting her own interpretation on their arrival the night before . " It was n't easy . " Thatcher had decided to be blunt . " And the problem now is to keep him here . " 73  | " Henry does get enthusiastic about things , " Ruth said fondly . " It 's one of his charms . " " Look here , Ruth . It may be one of his charms for you , but I doubt if the police see it that way . " Unperturbed , Ruth poured coffee and extended the sugar bowl . She was a pleasantly plump woman with gray hair that sprang vigorously from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ police were suspicious of him at first . But after they checked with the Appalachian Mountain Club and found out how casual his acquaintance with Steve Lester was , he said they were inclined to forget about him . " " True enough , " Thatcher conceded . " But now Henry 's started being an amateur detective . He 's been closeted with Eunice Lester , and I know he wanted to cross-examine everybody at Fiord Haven , if not everybody in New Hampshire . " Ruth tut-tutted . " I suppose you tried to explain how the police might misinterpret all this interest of his . " " Repeatedly . " " And he did n't understand , " Ruth concluded comfortably . " That 's my Henry for you . " " Seriously , Ruth , I think it would be a worthy project for you to dampen this enthusiasm . Surely there 's some other hobby he can take up . " " I gave up trying to dampen him thirty years ago . It 's impossible . " She smiled reassuringly across the table . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suppose the important thing is to keep him away from Fiord Haven . " Thatcher admired her confidence . " Certainly that 's the first step . " " Let 's see , maybe I could promote a crisis at The Pepper Mill . No , I do n't think that would do much good . He 's not likely to be very interested . Or , I could tell him that he does n't know enough about Steve Lester 's background . That , at least , would take him in another direction . What a good thing it is , " she ended in a burst of parochialism , " that those wives were there for the police to suspect . "  | " If there had n't been any wives , there might not have been any murder , " Thatcher said , trying to introduce a semblance of logic into the conversation . Ruth rose above logic . " See ? That 's exactly what I mean . I suppose it 's the first wife who 's the prime suspect . " Thatcher 's agreement was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there 's no doubt about that . But otherwise , I 'm not so sure . There 's no indication that she left her motel room during the critical period . And no one noticed any abnormal behavior on her part . She was n't seen sobbing hysterically or trembling with rage that afternoon . Nor does there seem to have been a sudden deterioration in her relations with Lester , just a steady hostility that had been going on for months . " " What about when they met each other without warning on Saturday morning ? Henry said there was some sort of excitement then . " " Both Lester and Eunice were upset at the sudden confrontation . All the spectators are agreed on that . They came face to face without warning at the morning lecture . But some people say that the one who did the raging was Amanda Lester . " " The second wife , " Ruth mused . " I suppose the police are n't overlooking her . " " By no means . The great strength of Eunice 's position is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surface and , insofar as it can be checked , is truthful . She was disturbed to find her ex-husband in the weekend party and was determined not to buy a lot at Fiord Haven if he did . The minute he told her he was going to buy , she decided to leave . " Ruth pounced . " But she did n't leave . She was still there hours later . " " She explains that , too . She had made plans to be away for the weekend . Her son was with friends , her refrigerator was bare , and she had been swept up into the treadmill of Fiord Haven activities . Lester announced his decision that after-  | noon . She decided to stay for cocktails and dinner , then drive home . " " That sounds reasonable , " Ruth nodded dubiously . " But Amanda does n't go along with that , does she ? " Thatcher was warming to his story . " That is where the complications begin . I do n't suppose the police are ever prepared to exonerate a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems to have been an unpremeditated emotional outburst . And , when the spouse starts lying , they become very interested , indeed . " " Unpremeditated ? " Ruth seemed to be testing this new concept . " Yes , I 'll go along with that . You said he was hit on the head with a hammer , did n't you ? Then , the police are right . No woman would plan to kill her husband that way . " Thatcher was amused at her air of expert judgment . " Oh ? And how would you go about murdering Henry ? " he inquired . " Strangling , " she said cheerfully . " Sometimes when he goes burbling on for hours , I plan it out in great detail . " Behind the curtain of fifteen years as a widower , Thatcher 's memories of the marital state stirred into life . " Well , never mind about that , " he said hastily , " the important thing is that Amanda denied Lester had decided to buy a lot . But the police had already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he corroborated Eunice 's story . " " I do n't think that 's so suspicious . This all happened on the day of the murder . Maybe Lester did n't have a chance to tell his wife . " " No , that wo n't hold up . The police have gone into Lester 's movements that day very thoroughly . If everybody is telling the truth , this is what happened . Directly after lunch , Quinlan made an impromptu sales effort which was successful . Lester agreed to buy lot number seventy-three , and Quinlan was to have the contract ready for him the next day . Lester then left for his walk and met Eunice in the parking lot . Their encounter was seen but not overheard . He told Eunice he had bought a lot and went on into the woods . Eunice remained in  | the parking lot in full view until she was joined by the rest of her group . Two hours later Amanda and Lester were together for fifteen minutes during which time , so Amanda claims , Lester said nothing about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motel room , returned to the site and was murdered . " Ruth was thoughtful . " If he stormed out , they were probably quarreling . Maybe that 's why he forgot to tell her . " " It 's more likely they were quarreling just because he did tell her . " Thatcher paused to organize his arguments . " After all , the whole question of a vacation house had become entwined with the custody fight . If the Lesters won custody of Eunice 's son , then the worst thing in the world that could happen would be to find themselves cheek by jowl with Eunice and her new husband in a private housing colony . " Ruth 's maternal instincts were roused . " It would n't be so much fun for the little boy , either . He 'd turn into a football . " " Precisely . Under the circumstances it seems incredible that Lester would have forgotten to mention the purchase to Amanda . " " And what does she say to all this ' ? " " I gather she does n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ account . " She simply insists that Lester never would have chatted casually with Eunice . Hence , Eunice is simply trying to conceal the real reason for their encounter in the parking lot . " " And what does Eunice say ? " Thatcher sighed . " What do you expect ? Eunice says Amanda seized what looked like a glorious opportunity to be spiteful and throw suspicion . " For a moment Ruth was silent , pouring more coffee and wordlessly offering a plate of hot rolls . At last , she spoke . " You know what strikes me as odd ? " she asked . " It 's Eunice . Oh , I do n't mean her story of what happened on the day of the murder . I mean her general attitude . For instance , why is she so hostile to Amanda ? Why does she assume that t  | Amanda is being spiteful ? After all , when Amanda first told her story , she must have been in shock and she 's only a young thing . " Thatcher stared across the table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why is she hostile ? You 've seen plenty of divorces , Ruth . It 's not uncommon for the first wife to be antagonistic to the second . " Ruth shook her head gently . " But there 's usually a reason . Very often the second wife is the woman who stole my husband . ' That does n't apply here . Or , there 's just plain jealousy . If the first wife is reduced to loneliness , she 's likely to see red at the sight of the second wife enjoying the comforts of marriage . But Henry said that the Lesters first approached Eunice when she was already engaged . Now that 's usually a time when a woman is feeling very pleased with herself . She 's not likely to be jealous of an ex-husband . If she has grounds for detesting him , she 's far more likely to pity his second wife . You know , the **26;755;TOOLONG attitude . " " I may have been overhasty , " Thatcher acknowledged . " I simply accepted Eunice 's dislike as natural . Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lesters , after all , were threatening Eunice 's coming marriage and trying to steal her child . That 's enough to promote dislike . " " Perhaps . But I bet Eunice blamed most of that on Steve . Amanda would n't be much more than his follower in all this . But there 's another thing that bothers me about Eunice . That 's this marriage of hers . " " What 's wrong with it ? " Thatcher demanded impatiently . " Well , they 're not exactly rushing to the altar , are they ? " Ruth asked reasonably . " Eighteen months ago Eunice was getting engaged . It 's not as if they were youngsters waiting to finish college . Not that they do , these days , " she reflected . Thatcher tried to remember what Henry had told him . " There 's no question of divorce , " he reflected aloud . " The man 's a widower with grown-up children . The wedding is planned for next month , I believe . This vacation house is to be a wedding present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Ruth said significantly . " What makes you think that ? " Thatcher was confused . " It was Eunice 's fiance who was originally on the list for Fiord Haven 's weekend . Because of his car . " Ruth suddenly metamorphized into a shrewd retailer . " That 's not a bad way of narrowing down a field for a mailing list . People with money and sports car instincts . " Henry had been busy to some purpose , Thatcher thought grimly . How many police suspicions had he stirred while getting this information ? " I suppose you 're trying to tell me that the man in Eunice 's life has money , " he remarked . " Well , he 's a catch for a divorcee working to support a child . And she seems to be having trouble landing him . " Not for the first time Thatcher had cause to reflect on the ruthless realism of women . How much of this quality did Amanda 's candy-box fragility conceal ? His ruminations were interrupted by Henry 's return . The man of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into his news without preliminaries . " I was talking to Calvin . Our local state trooper , " he explained for Thatcher 's benefit . " He does n't seem to know much that we do n't . The police have crossed off all the prospects at the motel except the wives . It seems that everybody was in their room dressing or showering and they cancel each other out . The only ones who were alone , besides the Fiord Haven management running around setting things up , were the wives . The salesmen were in a huddle . So that narrows it down to Eunice , Amanda , Quinlan , Valenti , and that architect . That 's if you forget the Davidsons . " " And if you forget passersby like Thatcher and Morland , " his guest contributed . Henry regally waved this aside . " Why should I rush up to somebody I barely know and bash his head in ? " Absently , Thatcher reached for a turnover . " Is that just one of your flights of fancy ? Or do the police @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who the murderer ? "  | " That 's the official version , " Henry replied , quaffing his coffee with gusto . " I 'm not so sure I go along with that theory myself . I may have to look into it more . " For once Thatcher disregarded the need to suppress Henry . " I think they 're right . That would explain the location of the body , which has always puzzled me . " " What 's wrong with the location of the body ? A nice secluded spot , no workmen due until Monday , ease of egress . If I had n't happened to stumble across Lester when I did , the police probably could n't even have pinpointed the time of death . A first-class choice , if you ask me , " Henry concluded . " You could do better , " Thatcher said . " What about Valenti 's idea ? " Henry disliked having his expertise questioned . " That bag of wind ? " he said . Here was something Ruth had not heard about . " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told her . " Valenti thought suspicion of murder could have been avoided entirely . Why not tumble the body down a hillside ? With a little stage management , say a rock in the right place , Lester would just be another unfortunate mountain fatality . " Henry did his best to spot flaws . " It would have to be a clever stage set to fool a real investigation . " " And what chance would there have been of a serious investigation ? Lester would n't have appeared for dinner . People would remember he had gone off on his own , but it would already be too dark to mount a search . The next morning he would be found in a natural setting . I doubt if the police would have cordoned off the area , searched it rigorously , demanded a postmortem . No , the murderer just was n't thinking . There was probably an argument , a sudden fight , and then a panicstricken flight . The murderer is probably having second thoughts just about now . " Thatcher could see the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ professorial by the minute . " But remember , the group only had one free hour between  | tour and cocktail party . Maybe the murderer had to rush back to the motel to be on time . " " Are n't you boys forgetting something ? " Rush asked blandly . " I doubt it , " said her husband . " The murderer may not have been strong enough to cart bodies around the countryside . " Ruth leaned back , an engimatic smile on her lips . She did n't have to say anything else and she knew it , Thatcher realized . All three of them were suddenly visualizing Stephen Lester 's wives . J  | HENRY was not the man to sit enthralled by someone else 's imaginings . Pushing aside his cup and saucer , he announced that he could n't sit here wasting the day . He had things to do . " By the way , Ruth , " he said , elaborately casual , " if you 've got a list , I could do the marketing for you . I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife did not point out that the shopping center was ten miles from the lumberyard . Instead she produced her list and eyed her husband thoughtfully . " With that schedule , I do n't suppose you and John will be home for lunch , " she offered . Henry was much struck with this observation . " Now that you mention it , I guess we wo n't . But , then , you were n't expecting us to be here today so , really , it 's a help to you . " All wives are familiar with husbands hell-bent on doing what they want and , at the same time , determined to be regarded as benefactors . Sensible women do not fight nature . " That will be a great help , " said Ruth kindly . She did not speak again until the two men were in the car , ready to leave . " Oh , Henry ! " she called from the back door . " If I were you , I 'd start at the bank . That 's where the real gossip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ John Thatcher realized what she meant . They had driven into Gridleigh , the county seat . On the sidewalk in front of the bank , they had met the State Conservation Agent . Henry 's opening question was forestalled . p 83 " I hear you got mixed up with that bunch of developers at Fiord Haven , Henry . Finding bodies for them , or something , " the agent said disapprovingly . " What are they like ? " " I was going to ask you , " Henry replied promptly . " We did n't see much of them . Have n't they been around your of-fice ? " " Like hell ! Big operators like them do n't use local talent . They brought up some experts of their own to test that lake of theirs . Probably cost them a fortune . " Henry and the conservation agent grinned pleasantly at each other . The same tests would have been performed free of charge by the State of New Hampshire . The agent then admitted he was looking forward to Fiord Haven 's approach to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hunting and fishing being available . How do you think they 'll find out what streams are stocked with trout ? They could get a list just by calling my office . So I suppose they 'll hire a big shot who 'll spend days checking every drop of water for miles . " Henry , with every evidence of satisfaction , agreed that this was likely . The agent , who seemed to be keeping abreast of each action and each publication by Fiord Haven in his jurisdiction , then took his leave , saying he was sorry that he could n't help Henry . " But you might try Guy Villars . They might have contacted him and I just saw him in the bank . " Within seconds , John Thatcher was towed indoors and Henry was bearing down on a rumpled , middle-aged man stuffing bills into his wallet . " Guy ! " called Henry , who opened his interrogations with an artless lack of pretense . " Do you know anything about this Fiord Haven crowd ? " Except for differences in wording , Guy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The management of Fiord Haven had not condescended to utilize the services of a local lawyer . Nonetheless , the local lawyer was surprisingly abreast of their movements .  | " This Quinlan is a lawyer , himself . Guess he and Valenti figure if they 're sharp enough to take on the opposition in Boston , they can take care of themselves up here . " Villars permitted himself an earthy chuckle . " You think it ever occurs to these sharpies that New Hampshire has had to make a living out of them for the past eighty years ? " The conservation agent , Thatcher had noticed , was indistinguishable from any young man on Wall Street . Guy Villars , on the other hand , flaunted a slow drawl , rural colloquialisms , and laborious frowns . Thatcher was willing to bet that he had been to Harvard . Henry said briskly that sharpies had to learn from experience , just like everybody else , and had Quinlan done all the preliminary legal work himself ? " Yup , " Villars nodded . " Not that there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plans for the new highway were finished , then he just scouted around for a big parcel of land that would be convenient for Boston commuting . Did n't need much except a pond and some hills for skiing . God knows , if there 's anything New Hampshire 's got , it 's ponds and hills . Then he bought a couple of farms and got down to work . Did all the paperwork from his city office . He and that Valenti set up a corporation . " Villars paused to smile blandly . " And good luck to ' em , I say . We could use some big spenders around here . " " It might change the character of the place , " Henry warned . " Not as long as they 're not registered voters , it wo n't . " Villars gave a valedictory grin and moved off . " One of your politicians ? " Thatcher asked curiously . " He 's our state legislator now , " Henry confirmed . " But he 's got his eye on the Congressional seat . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if we can get hold of Don Cavers for lunch . " Don Cavers turned out to be the president of the Gridleigh National Bank . While Henry was rooting him out of his office , Thatcher had leisure to examine his surroundings . It was a long time since he had seen a bank like this . There was dark  | oak wainscoting halfway up the walls , the single plate-glass window bore the bank 's title in gold script , and behind the elaborately carved grilles , an ancient and gigantic safe stood in the tellers ' quarters . The man in charge of this period piece was all of thirty years old . " Glad to meet you , " he said warmly . " 1 guess this does n't seem in the same league as the Sloan . " Thatcher agreed that there were surface differences . " But we 're doing well , very well , " said Cavers , leading the way across the street . " Of course , all this second-home building helps . And the ski resort business is booming . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last five years . We 'll be putting in an electronic data processing system this winter . High time we modernized our systems ! " Thatcher seated himself in the tavern booth and applauded these signs of prosperity . " I suppose you 'll be modernizing your premises at the same time ? " Cavers hooted . " Not on your life ! You ca n't believe what an attraction that turn-of-the-century look is . When people come in to see about a mortgage to buy a vacation place , the bank 's appearance does half the selling job . They think they 're really getting away from it all . Back to small-town America and old-time virtues . " Thatcher readjusted his ideas . " That safe I saw in a corner ? " he probed experimentally . " Great , is n't it ? " Cavers beamed . " I picked it up last year . Of course , we 've got steel-lined vaults in the basement . But the summer people do n't know that . " Henry felt he had allowed decent time for shop talk . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their murder , " he said . " Interesting bunch , I 'd say . " " Really ? " Cavers did n't look as if he believed it . " They did n't do any of their financing through us , you know . " Fiord Haven , it seemed , had not tapped the local conservation agent , the local lawyer , or the local banker .  | " Did they get stung ? " Thatcher asked frankly . Cavers considered the question . " About average , I 'd say , " he concluded . " Of course , in the long run , they 'll do all right . Any developer up here does , if he can sell off his lots . I do n't know about their financial position , but they bought four farms , all abandoned , or semi-abandoned , including Miller 's Pond . And they 've done their good deed for every other farm in the area . Land that had been a drug on the market started to skyrocket the minute the first bulldozer rolled in . I hear Courtney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lots for A-frames . " Henry said there were no flies on Courtney Blair . " In the long run , you 'll do well out of it , too , " Thatcher observed . " And how ! " Cavers agreed enthusiastically . " Sooner or later , Fiord Haven 's customers will be coming to us for mortgage money to build . I can wait . I 'd just as soon some outfit in Boston took the high risks on the land development and the communal building . Not that Alec Prohack has had any complaints about slow payments . I 'll stick with the individual mortgages . Do you know that we have n't had more than ten foreclosures during the last fifteen years in the whole state ? Funny thing , people seem to hang on to country places even harder than to their regular homes . " A discussion of this point carried them through beer and knockwurst . It was agreed that people might overextend themselves financially for a first home because they had to have one . But a vacation place was genuinely optional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot of luxuries like second cars and boats that can be sacrificed if the pressure goes on . There 's some slack in their financial position , " Cavers argued cogently . " And they 're the kind we need in New Hampshire . God bless them all . " When Thatcher and Henry left him , he was audibly planning the introduction of a Franklin stove into the main area of the bank .  | " A bright young man , " Thatcher observed . " I wonder when he 'll get to wooden Indians . " " Don ? I do all my business with him . He did his training at some New York bank , then came back here to take over from his father . Old Cavers is the one who financed The Pepper Mill . " Henry sighed nostalgically . " Those were the days . " Long experience had taught Thatcher that everybody looked back longingly on the days when payments to the bank constituted a monthly crisis . Nothing could convince Henry he had everything now that he did then , except @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked shamefaced . " Now , I suppose , we 've got to go to that damned shopping center . " At the supermarket Henry seized a shopping cart with one hand , clutched Ruth 's list in the other , and cantered down the aisles . A rain of staples flowed into his basket , from onions to canned soup . This orderly program collapsed at the delicatessen counter . Here he abandoned lists and took the bit between his teeth . As Thatcher watched smoked salmon , fried rice and Greek olives succeed each other , he found himself wondering what kind of menu Henry had in mind . It was , he saw , providential that weight restrictions on the Appalachian Trail confined them to unimaginative freeze-dried foods . Henry noticed his companion 's look . " Women , " he said largely , " do n't understand delicatessen food . " " Do n't you think you have enough ? " asked Thatcher . Henry had just ordered some cheesecake as a last-minute inspiration . " That 's right . We still have to get to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day . At the checkout counter they took up their positions behind a familiar plaid shirt . " Alec ! " said Henry happily . Alec Prohack , chief of the construction crew at Fiord Haven , turned to greet them over a basket filled with six-packs of beer and pretzels.  | " Having a few of the boys over to watch the game , " he explained with a wave of the hand . " Not working at the site ? " Henry inquired . " The cops are n't letting us start until tomorrow . " " Too bad , " Thatcher sympathized . " Does n't make any difference , " Prohack said heavily . " You ca n't get on with the job unless the guys you 're building for make up their minds what they want . " " Do n't they know what they want ? " Thatcher was surprised . Indecision had not seemed characteristic of Fiord Haven . " It 's not them . It 's the professor . You know , with the long hair and the lapels . I told Finley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Now he agrees . But he 's in a huddle with the cops . And , with Quinlan screaming about the extra cost and Valenti worried about the time schedule , nobody 's willing to give us the go-ahead . " Henry brushed aside irrelevancies . " What 's Finley doing with the cops ? " " They found out about some argument between him and that guy , Lester . Naturally if you have a bust-up with a guy who 's murdered , you have to explain to the cops . " Prohack shrugged . " Hell , the cops just want to be able to file it away . No one thinks Finley hammered Lester . " " Why not ? " Henry asked baldly . " Never picked up a hammer in his life , " Prohack said simply . Protests from the rear of the line and beckonings from the cash register broke up the conference . Prohack passed through the check-out and into the parking lot . But he left Henry 's ever-fertile mind busily whirring . " I do n't think that stands up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back in the car , and Thatcher had not kept pace with his companion 's internal monologue . " What does n't ? " " This business of Finley not being the type . After all , he 's as much the type as Amanda or Eunice . The police theory is that somebody lost his head and acted out of type . "  | " But Amanda and Eunice might conceivably have a motive for losing their heads , " Thatcher objected . " How do we know about Finley 's motives ? " Henry demanded unanswerably . " That 's what we 've got to find out . Why , we do n't even know how much he 's got riding on Fiord Haven . Or  --  wait a minute ! " " Yes ? " said Thatcher fearing the worst . " He 's from California , is n't he ? Maybe Lester and Finley knew each other a lot better than we 've assumed . I can see there 's a lot of work to be done here . " Thatcher reminded himself that someone else had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worse . " The first thing to do , " he said firmly , " is to tell Ruth about it and see what she says . " Ruth , looking firmly into space , said that she thought it was all very interesting . She personally agreed that the master key must lie elsewhere . In California . Or in Boston . In fact , anywhere  --  far , far away from Captain Frewen . " That 's right , " Henry seethed . " What we should do ? " " What you should do , " said Ruth inexorably , " is go down to Boston . " For a moment , Thatcher had feared it would be San Francisco . " And see what we can find out , " Henry finished happily . " Yes , " said Ruth , giving Thatcher a long look . Like Miss Corsa , Ruth was a virtuoso of wordless communication . " Boston it is , " said Thatcher . And if that was not performance above and beyond the call of duty , he did n't know what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the family car and speed across this vast continent via six-lane tollways , the Appalachian Trail is pretty small potatoes . True , it extends a respectable two thousand miles from Maine to Georgia , but it boasts no gas stations , no hot dog stands , no Holiday Inns . In the land of Henry Ford , the Appalachian Trail is , after all , only a footpath . It is not even an historic footpath . Once upon a time , a considerable stretch of today 's trail was paralleled by the Great Indian Warpath , stretching from the Creek territory in Alabama northward into Pennsylvania . But the Creeks were no fools ; they traversed valleys and lowlands , not crests . And today , the Red Man has given way to traffic jams , garbage dumps , and the other amenities of civilization . Indeed , contrary to widespread belief , the Appalachian Trail is not a relic of America 's hardier past . It is a mammoth creation of modern man that has generated comparable housekeeping chores . After every winter , after every summer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carefully blazed so that no feckless city folk can wander into danger . Apartment dwellers , lulled by air conditioning , have lost their forebears ' healthy respect for nature . The Appalachian Trail has to be kept very safe indeed to allow Americans access to a great wilderness , without overloading rescue squads from Mount Katandin to Springer Mountain . These onerous responsibilities rest on the combined backs  | of many thousands of men and women who themselves value the exhilaration of the trail and who exert themselves to keep it available to others . Naturally , these enthusiasts have formed clubs : the Green Mountains Club , the Susquehanna Club , the Eastern Branch of the Sierra Club , among others . They hold meetings , they enroll members , they offer programs , they dicker with other clubs . But , above all , they maintain the trail . In a very real sense , spiritual and temporal leadership emanates from the Appalachian Mountain Club , on Joy Street , in Boston . The Appalachian Mountain Club is ninety-three years old , the oldest mountaineering group in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the trail and has nearly twelve thousand members . It is a matter of deep pride , to the Appalachian Mountain Club , that it has preserved many scenic attractions . So , too , is its extensive mountaineering library , open to the public . " What do you hope to learn at the Club  --  besides the fact that Lester was a reliable trip leader and a serious biker ? " asked Thatcher as the taxi from Logan Airport finally emerged from the tunnel to a distressing view of the New Boston . " Do n't you worry , " Henry assured him . " They wo n't foist off that Scout 's honor stuff on me ! " Henry , Thatcher knew , had an ambivalent approach to the Appalachian Mountain Club . He was , of course , a stalwart in good standing , as he had been these many years . Indeed , Thatcher recalled that Henry was chairman ( emeritus ) of the Committee on Appalachian Mountain Leadership and Safety , and had guided that body through a hotly fought revision of guidelines . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ax in hand , had been one of the pioneers in the field , venturing into uncharted and uncleared territories . But in the last decade , a change had taken place . Henry accepted , and discharged with brilliant success , responsibility for the maintenance and marking of 3.6 miles of the Appalachian Trail ( from Pepperton Gap to Lumley Crossing ) . This suzerainty had altered his values . His interest in the Appala-  | chian Mountain Club had not abated , far from it . But his view of self had shifted . From loyal club member , Henry had become a potentate in his own right . The AMC , with II , 500 members , maintained three hundred and sixty miles of the trail . Henry Morland maintained 3.6 miles . All things considered , he was inclined to feel that this left them just about even . Oh well , thought Thatcher , they knew Henry pretty well at Joy Street . " New Government Center over there , " said the taxi driver , morosely breaking the silence in the immobilized cab . Whatever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were not abandoning a street grid resembling a plate of spaghetti . Without much interest , Thatcher and Henry leaned forward to inspect a nightmare of concrete stretching , as Henry put it , in too many directions . " Tables , " said the driver bitterly . Henry was , inevitably , curious . " They got new tables in there , " explained the driver , starting up Beacon Street with a crash of gears . " Cost seven hundred bucks each . " The Appalachian Mountain Club , although occupying an ancient building across from the gold dome of Charles Bulfinch 's great State House , promised moral , physical and spiritual distance from the New Boston . Thatcher did not look forward to what was coming . Henry never hared off unprepared . On the contrary , if he had a fault along those lines , he overplanned . The trip from New Hampshire to Logan had been spent , from Thatcher 's point of view , learning what Henry hoped to accomplish . Henry wanted to learn more about the late Stephen Lester . To this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Philips who had done Mount Mansfield with Lester last summer and then with one Harold Downes . At lunch Bradford Ogburn , noted geographer , conservationist and AMC eminent , would be pumped . " Then , " Thatcher had commented caustically , " I suppose you propose talking to Lester 's secretary and his dentist . "  | He was alarmed by the effect of these words and reminded himself to curb his tongue . His role on this expedition was to brake Henry , not add fuel to the flames . " . . . real reliable , " young Philips was earnestly explaining ten minutes later . " In fact ? " " Yes , " said Henry alertly . Philips looked around helplessly . " Well , for my money , he went by the book a little too much . " " A perfectionist ? " asked Henry , himself a perfectionist . George Philips was abashed and Thatcher took pity on him . " I take it you mean that Lester was overly rigid . " Philips was better with rocks than with words . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you understand . But if things did n't go just the way he thought they should  --  well , he 'd let you know about it . He was always laying down the law about one thing or another . " By now George Philips was profoundly unhappy . At a guess , Thatcher would say that he was a young man who liked to think well of people . Pressing him for unsavory details about a man now dead , was an unkindness . It was not one from which Henry shrank . " Made a lot of enemies , I suppose , " he said . " Strange how I never noticed this assertiveness when I was on the committee with him . " Philips grinned at Henry . " You did n't give him a chance to sound off , " he pointed out . " Anyway , I do n't say Lester made a lot of enemies . But he was the kind of guy who thought he was the only one who never made mistakes . " " If that does n't make enemies , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does . " Philips was ingenuous . " People just shrug it off , " he said . " Nobody bothers . " Somebody , Henry pointed out , had bothered . But they had exhausted George Philips ' meager supply of perceptive insights long before the phone told them that Harold Downes was waiting for them in the library .  | " Now we 'll really get some information , " Henry said confidently as he bustled forward . " This is the man who sponsored Lester for membership . Said he 'd known him for twelve years in the application . " But Harold Downes , while admitting the friendship , dashed Henry 's hopes . First , he insisted on asking them questions . " It was a shock , reading about the murder in the papers , " he said , earnestly wagging his head . " I could n't believe it was Steve they were talking about . You must know all about it , since you were there . " Decency required that they provide an abbreviated account of the murder of Stephen Lester . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Downes said he would never understand it , not if he lived to be a hundred . This was not as impressive a confession as it might have been . Downes 's kindly , bewildered face made it clear that life presented him with unfathomable mysteries almost daily . " I 'd like to know about the funeral , " he said soberly . " Alison and I want to attend , as a mark of respect . " Thatcher suggested that he call the Lester home in Weston for details . This was enough of an opening for Henry . " That 's the second Mrs. Lester out in Weston , " he said pointedly . " But I guess you know all about that , having been a friend of Lester 's for so many years . " Downes blinked uncertainly . " Well , I do n't know that I 'd say that , " he said cautiously . " You see , I knew Steve when we were both students in Cambridge , graduate students , that is . We were in the Outing Club together . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But , of course , when he went out to the Coast , we lost touch . I had n't heard from him in years when he called up one day and said he 'd moved back East and wanted to join the Appalachian Club . I was glad to sponsor him . He 'd been active in the Sierra Club in California , and worked on their conservation committee . And , of course , I remembered what a good rock climber he was ? "  | Henry moved to forestall yet another dissertation on Stephen Lester 's excellence as a mountaineer . " But then you must have known Lester during his first marriage , " he said accusingly . Downes was certainly anxious to oblige . He frowned harder than ever . " You know , when I was reading the story in the paper about the two wives , I was trying to remember about her . I think , in fact I 'm almost sure , that I did meet her at one of the Club 's Christmas parties . " " You mean you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Downes looked up in mild surprise . " That 's right . She never came on any of our trips , or anything . I think she had a job and could n't get away . Besides , Steve was n't the type , you know . " Before Henry frightened his fish , Thatcher decided to take a hand . " I 'm afraid we do n't know , Mr. Downes . We never met Mr. Lester alive . What type was n't he ? " Downes responded to gentler methods by displaying a surprising aptitude for social commentary . " With married students , one of two things happens . You understand , I 'm talking about someone who gets married but moves in a crowd that 's mostly unmarried . Either the guy goes domestic and his house becomes the natural clubhouse for gatherings  --  there 's always a refrigerator full of food and drink and a comfortable living room and a wife who 'll get out cheese and crackers  --  or else he keeps his marriage completely apart and comes out for a beer just like anyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think any of us were ever invited up to his place . " Henry obviously disapproved of this mode of life , but whether because it was hard on the wife at the time or because it was hard on the detective years later , Thatcher could not say . " And you all accepted this ? " Henry said sternly . Downes was not one of nature 's warriors . " What would you have expected us to do ? " Then he shrugged . " But , hell , sure we accepted it . We did n't know anything about marriage .  | I do n't think I 've ever thought about it until now . And , now , I 'm a different person . I 've been married for eight years . I 've got three kids . " " So now it does seem odd . You do n't think that 's the way you 'd treat your own wife . " Suddenly Downes grinned broadly . " I 'd like to see me trying . You do n't know Alison . " En route to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did it in one sentence . " Nobody liked Lester . " " I do n't think it 's that straightforward , Henry . Nobody liked him , but nobody seems to have realized it . " " These outdoor types , " said Henry with fine contempt . " You ca n't expect them to analyze their feelings . " Thatcher opted for diplomacy . " Certainly you have a point there . But I wonder if Lester may not have had some chameleon quality of his own . He seems to have had a talent for being accepted as the conventional norm in any group he moved into . " " It 's simpler than that , John . " Henry gave a short bark of laughter . " Lester just told everybody he was a man of high standards and they believed him . " But they were about to meet one man who had not . Dr. Bradford Ogburn , who frequently lectured on Our Ascent of Everest or Twenty Days on Manga Pan , was more critical . " No , I know you did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good committee man . Oh yes , he did his homework but he was stubborn as sin . To be frank , he did n't know how to get along with people . " This cool assessment was made over lunch in the Men 's Bar of Locke-Ober 's . Ogburn had listened to the details of Lester 's dramatic death without particular distress . " Like him ? " he replied to a broadside from Henry . " No , I  | did n't particularly like him . That does n't mean I hit him over the head , Henry . Believe me . " Henry may have believed him . At any rate he plunged into thought leaving Thatcher to make light conversation with Ogburn . It was heavy going . Ogburn was a professional charmer , with one amusing anecdote after another . He was , Henry had revealed , unsurpassed at fund raising for many excellent causes , from conservation to scientific expeditions . Oddly enough , be had many similarities to James Joel Finley . After lunch , Ogburn excused himself as they set off down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explained musically . It was yet another lecture , this time to the Radcliffe Alumnae Club of Brookline . Henry was not , after all , immune to human atmosphere . " Going downhill around here , " he said , apparently observing in the tawdriness of Tremont Street portents of the decline and fall of the Appalachian Mountain Club . " But I liked young Philips . " Thatcher agreed . " f have never liked the thespian 's approach to outdoor activities ? " He had lost his companion 's erratic interest . Henry was checking his watch . " Now what , Henry ? " he asked resigned , he thought , for the worst . Once again Henry surprised him .  | HALF-DEFIANT , half-complacent , Henry proceeded to announce that he had seized an idle moment at Locke Ober 's to phone Eunice Lester . " She asked me to keep in touch . Wants to know how things are going , up in Fiord Haven , " he ran on glibly . " It seemed like the right thing to do . Remember , John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wished he could duplicate the noise with which Ruth Morland greeted such statements of high-mindedness . Henry took a deep breath . " Anyway , I promised her we 'd run right out to Arlington . Let 's find ourselves a taxi . " " Henry ! " Thatcher exploded . " Angling for information at the Appalachian Club is one thing . But this goes beyond the bounds of decency . You ca n't force yourself on Eunice Lester now . She 's got enough problems . " " No , no ! " Henry protested . " You 've got it all wrong , John . Eunice answered the phone as if I were the cavalry coming to the rescue . She really wants us to come . " Thatcher examined him suspiciously . There was no doubt about Henry 's sincerity . But how much of Henry 's judgment was due to wishful thinking ? Unfortunately , there was only one way to find out . The drive to Arlington was enlivened by Henry 's lurid conjectures about the cause of Eunice 's current distress . Imminent arrest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be with her right now , " he said , contemplating  | the possibility with pleasurable anticipation . " Though in that case , it 's hard to see what she expects us to do . " Thatcher grunted skeptically . Eunice Lester had not impressed him as mentally deficient . And that 's what it would take to introduce Henry into such a situation . " Well , maybe not , " said Henry , answering the spirit of the grunt . " But then there 's always Amanda . Maybe the two of them are having a knock-down , drag-out fight . " " Then , it 's even harder to see what she expects us to do . " Thatcher 's asperity was no longer veiled . " Unless we 're supposed to pitch in on Eunice 's side . In which case , I 'll hold your coat . " Unabashed , Henry progressed to further flights of fancy , but Thatcher was no longer listening . According to the driver , they were now in the immediate vicinity of Eunice Lester 's home . The problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The houses seemed to date from the turn of the century . Most of them were straggling two-story frame structures with complicated roofs and wide porches . Their owners seemed too poor to hire badly needed painters and masons . But they were not too poor to be respectable . The yards were neatly raked and the trash cans disciplined . Care and attention had been lavished on shrubberies and flower borders . Eunice Lester 's house , finally located , was a model in this respect . Dark shingle walls formed a background for gleaming windows and bright marigolds . On the porch they found two bells , the upper marked : Mrs. Eunice Lester . Henry 's heroic ring produced an immediate answering click which unlocked the front door . As they entered the front hall , their hostess was bending over the banister . " Come right up ! " she called . " I was hoping that was you. , , One look was enough to prove that Henry had not been fantasying . Eunice was indeed glad to see them . She ushered them into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the last man that Thatcher expected to see . " Mr. Quinlan is just leaving , " Eunice said firmly , preventing any round of greetings .  | Eddie Quinlan shrugged good-naturedly . He even seemed amused . " Sure , Mrs. Lester . I do n't want to intrude while you have Mr. Morland and Mr. Thatcher here . But you 'll remember what I said ? " " Absolutely , " Eunice replied , handing him his hat . For an apostle of the hard sell , Quinlan proved surprisingly easy to evict . Within minutes Eunice had shown him out . " Thank God you came , " she said , returning . " I never would have gotten rid of him otherwise . And I do n't know what he 's up to . I do n't know what any of them are up to . It 's as if everybody is part of some scheme except ? " She stopped , aghast at the sound of her own voice rising out of control . There could be no denying that , with Eunice , Henry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he slowly looked at his surroundings , then turned to say , " You 've got a nice place here . I like the way you 've fixed it up . " Eunice was momentarily startled . Then her face softened into a smile . She , too , looked around , as if drawing support from the home she had made . " I 'm glad you like it , Henry . I did most of it myself . " Henry 's observation had some merit , aside from the strictly therapeutic . The room had dormer windows and sloping ceilings in the corners . But there was no sense of constraint . White wallpaper with an airy green trellis design had been used everywhere ; there were crisp white curtains , and the nondescript furniture had been slipcovered in a green and white print . Everything was spanking clean . The room radiated gaiety and good cheer . " Oh , Henry , " Eunice cried impulsively , " I 'm so glad you 're here . I 'll go mad if I do n't talk to somebody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cast him . If anybody was entitled to take bows at the moment , it was Henry . Eunice , suddenly remembering her duties , made offers of hospitality . Hastily declining for the two of them , Henry masterfully thrust Eunice into a chair .  | " What did Quinlan want ? " he asked baldly . A sudden thought occurred to Thatcher . " Good God , the man 's not trying to sell you a lot now , is he ? " Eunice shook her head . " No , he 's not doing that . He never so much as mentioned Fiord Haven . That was one of the peculiar things about him . " This unsatisfactory speech raised more questions than it answered . But Henry controlled himself and waited for Eunice to continue . " All I can tell you is what he said , " she began hesitantly . " According to him , he was helping Amanda when she was getting ready to leave Fiord Haven . They were having some kind of discussion about moving the body . Does that make sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reasonable that Stephen Lester should be buried somewhere other than New Hampshire . " All right , " Eunice went on . " That part seemed all right to me , too . But then Amanda said something about Steve having died without a will . So she would be executor or administrator or whatever it is , because she was his sole heir . Then according to Mr. Quinlan , he told her that could n't be right . She could n't be Steve 's only heir because Steve left a child . " " Ah ha ! " said Henry happily . " Who benefits ? " Eunice seemed capable of taking Henry 's aberrant enthusiasms in stride . " Now that sounds perfectly crazy to me . " Thatcher was genuinely startled . That was no way for the mother of a ten-year-old son to talk . " It makes perfectly good sense , " he objected . " Even if there were a will , the existence of a minor child ? " " No , " Eunice interrupted unceremoniously , " that 's not what I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she paused to smile ruefully at them , " I thought of it right off . But it did n't seem like a healthy subject to mention to the New Hampshire police . " Thatcher 's original impression was confirmed . Eunice Lester was no fool . " Then what is crazy ? " he persisted .  | " The way Quinlan is behaving , " Eunice answered roundly . " He swears this little piece of information just slipped out . Then , when he saw the effect it had on Amanda , he thought it his duty to race around to me and offer his apologies and support . " " Support ? " " For a minute I thought he was just touting for legal business . He is a lawyer , after all . Now I wonder if he is n't trying to stir things up . " " You have a point , " Thatcher agreed . " But of course , Amanda would have found out in time , anyway . " Eunice nodded energetically . " Oh , I know she would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her attention . But in a natural sequence , if you know what I mean . I would have gotten a lawyer . Amanda would have , too . Then the lawyers would have gotten together . Nothing would have happened for weeks or months . Instead Quinlan is throwing himself into things . Do you think he could be trying to get back at Amanda ? " " Why does he want to get back at her ? " Henry demanded . " What 's she done to him ? " " I do n't think he was very happy about the way she denied Steve bought a lot . Of course she backed down , when she heard Quinlan 's story . He probably did n't realize she was just being spiteful to me . He may have thought she was a chronic troublemaker , and he could n't resist the temptation to toss a little trouble her way . " Eunice sighed unhappily . " Oh , how I wish he had n't interfered . Whatever he had in mind , he 's just going to end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Eunice 's reaction , but he wanted to clear up an earlier statement . " Let 's go back a minute , " he suggested . " You say Amanda lied simply in a malicious attempt to throw suspicion on you . You do n't think she might have more substantial reasons for diverting police attention ? " Eunice 's eyes widened . " You mean because she murdered Steve herself ? "  | " Well , somebody did , " Thatcher reminded her . Eunice was not the crisp businesswoman she had been at Fiord Haven . Partly it was because her severe suit had been replaced by slacks and a shirt , partly it was because she was confused and permitting herself to show it . At the moment , she might have been as young as Amanda . " It just does n't make sense , " she said at last , frowning in concentration . " I still ca n't believe Steve has actually been murdered . It 's so unreasonable . But I 'll tell you the police are right about one thing . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Henry arched his eyebrows in silent protest . Eunice defended her statement . " Oh , I know that sounds impossible . But exasperation was the kind of emotion Steve aroused . To the nth degree . " " And the logical person to be exasperated by someone is his wife , " Thatcher said . " Is n't that so ? " " Not Amanda . " Eunice sounded regretful but sure . " In fact , that 's one of the reasons Amanda gets to me the way she does . I was having trouble with Steve within six weeks of our wedding . I could n't take that habit of his of making high and mighty moral judgments about everyone else  --  while he did exactly what he pleased . He was driving me up a wall long before he walked out on me . Then I saw him doing exactly the same sort of thing to Amanda , and it did n't ruffle her a bit . She 's destroyed an illusion of mine . I liked to think that no woman could live in peace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulling off the trick without batting an eyelash . " Thatcher , while reminding himself to relay this information to Ruth to help broaden her view of the first-wife  --  second-wife relationship , was moved to protest . " Come now , there 's some difference in your positions , is n't there ? " Eunice thought she understood . " You mean , there 's nothing like money for sweetening the temper ? I admit that Steve got under my skin most of all when I came home from work after  | stopping at the market . While I was making dinner , he 'd lean back and tell me how worried he was about the atom bomb . Or , how he was having a crisis of conscience about being in a university with defense contracts . He never had a crisis of conscience about letting me do the dishes . Okay , when he married Amanda , he was a self-supporting adult with a good salary . I think you 're suggesting I have a petty mind , and I wo n't admit it . " " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thatcher corrected her . " I meant that Amanda was n't committed to anything except her husband yet . She had n't undertaken any of the adult major responsibilities , primarily children , where she might have found herself in conflict with him . She could afford to be good-natured and tolerant . " Henry shifted restlessly . " I do n't like the way this conversation is going , " he confessed . " If you cross Amanda off , who 's left ? Eunice , that 's who . Just because of those big , adult responsibilities , like children . " " I did n't kill Steve . The only time I was ever likely to was when I was living with him . That 's when people really exasperate you . " " Not when they try to take your child away ? " Henry asked with what Thatcher regarded as foolhardy courage . But Eunice did not go up in flames . " That did n't exasperate me . That made me mad as hell . Mad enough to do something about it . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best interests of the child , coupled with a total avoidance of his son until he had some use for him . " Thatcher hoped that Eunice 's indulgence did n't operate exclusively for Henry . " What could you do ? I gather that your husband had acquired some damning information about you . You , yourself , said he was single-minded , regardless of cost , when he wanted something . " Eunice lost her look of youth . " You were n't listening very carefully . Steve was regardless of the cost to others . He was always mindful of any cost to Stephen Lester . He attacked me  | by playing the odds . He knew it was unlikely I would remain absolutely virtuous for ten years . Well , I played the odds , too . " Henry shook his head dubiously . " You mean Steve was unmarried for seven years ? But courts do n't pay much attention to that , do they ? " Eunice 's answer came as a surprise . " I did n't waste any time on Steve . Amanda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ met Steve they were both part of a swinging crowd . Two months ago I hired detectives to investigate Amanda . And I told them exactly what I wanted . Any record on any police blotter anywhere , particularly with reference to smoking pot . " Henry was a little shocked and did not trouble to conceal it . Thatcher , on the other hand , was moved to admiration . " Yes , indeed , " he said . " You were playing the odds . Did you get anything ? " " She was at a party that was raided for smoking marijuana . It would have been enough . For a corporate executive , that is . Steve 's public image did n't include a drug addict for a wife . " Henry 's voice was stern . " That girl ? She 's no more a drug addict than I am ! " " Of course not ! " Eunice snapped impatiently . " She probably smoked one joint in her life . But , then , I 'm not a streetwalker either . I was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afford one . But I knew my Steve . If there were likely to be any casualties on his side , he would n't be interested in fighting . He 'd forget about Tommy and start thinking about adopting . " Thatcher could not help feeling that Amanda would have been out of her depth in any confrontation between Eunice and Stephen Lester . Although , he suddenly remembered , not one of the many witnesses to their encounter at Fiord Haven had described Amanda as outclassed . He awoke to discover a plot in the making . " You could find out , could n't you , Henry ? If you went to see Amanda yourself ? " Eunice was definitely up to something . There was a roguish gleam in her eye .  | Thatcher , seeing Henry sit forward alertly , quickly intervened , " Why should we go see Amanda ? " Now Eunice was openly cajoling . " Because you understand about wills and estates . Oh , I know I 'll have to put my lawyer on to this eventually . But it would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about this . You could give her your advice , could n't you ? " Henry burst into speech . Publicly , Thatcher would later claim that he had yielded to the two-pronged blitzkreig launched by Eunice and Henry . But , as Miss Corsa could have predicted , it was his own curiosity that hooked him . He had , he discovered , one small question of his own for Amanda Lester .  | IT is a long way from Arlington , Massachusetts , to Weston , in more ways than one . " About twenty miles , " the driver had told Thatcher and Henry . The streetcar suburbs fell behind . The car sped out the Massachusetts Turnpike in the direction of one-acre zoning . And it became clear that twenty miles was delivering them to another world . Five minutes off the turnpike and they were on a tree-lined lane , winding through a carefully contrived rural scene past very large homes . Most of them were postwar colonial , flaunting costly appendages to the austere architectural form once hallowed by plain living and high thinking . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black wrought iron . A gas light guarded the long driveway . " Well , " said Thatcher when they had debouched onto a flagstone walk , " now we know the reason for that ruthless determination to get custody of a child only Eunice seems to have wanted before . " " Yes ? " said Henry . Thatcher indicated their surroundings . " The photographic effect , Henry . You remember , Eunice said the same thing . This setting calls for a large dog and children , as well as a station wagon and a GE kitchen . " " Do n't forget the Porsche , too , " said Henry grumpily . He followed Thatcher 's gaze . " It 's sure a far cry from that dump in Arlington . " 107  | Thatcher reminded himself of Henry 's fatal tendency to wax fiercely partisan in any controversy . It was not going to make this visit any easier . An overweight golden retriever , lying on the porch , blinked incuriously at them . The owner of The Pepper Mill studied the brass doorknocker before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he muttered . " I 'll bet they paid plenty for it . " Thatcher wished that he , himself , were as incurious as the dog . But he was beginning to follow the bad example being set by Henry . There was , in the first place , the question of how Amanda was reacting to the suggestion that ten-year-old Tommy Lester had certain rights . Amanda , no doubt , had always thought that the Lester worldly goods were provided by Providence for her comfort . Whether her husband was dead or alive . Then too , Thatcher was wondering about Henry 's immediate tactics . The jaunt to Arlington had been camouflaged in a socially acceptable way  --  by sympathy for Eunice who shared Henry 's status as police suspect and who had other claims on his compassion . But Henry was now going to be hoist by his own petard . He had been much moved by Eunice Lester 's lot in life . Just how would a partisan  --  and transparent  --  Henry behave here in Weston ? But when the door was opened by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not destined to see Henry 's response to this challenge . The play had already begun . He and Henry were , for the time being , only latecomers in the audience . For audience there was . Eunice Lester might be alone in the world . Amanda was surrounded by supporters . In the round of introductions , Thatcher identified Amanda 's father , who had opened the door for them , and Amanda 's mother , who was a slightly blurred version of her daughter . Two other men sat on the sofa near the fieldstone fireplace . They looked like official mourners : Thatcher deduced they were  | lawyers . Reasons for the dourness were not slow to emerge . Amanda was having trouble with her retinue . " . . . but of course I understand what you said about Steve not leaving a will , " she assured the sofa emphatically . " What difference does that make ? Steve did n't want her to have his money . He meant for me to have it . " This reasonableness touched something obscure in Amanda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she said lovingly . " When I think of how happy you both were when you were building this beautiful house together . . . " Amanda kept her guns trained elsewhere . " So , you 'll have to do something about it . " The sofa dwellers , a Mr. Clive and a Mr. Plassey it developed , listened to these commands with admirable self-control . There was , Thatcher reflected , something about the Boston legal profession lacking in New York . That cod-like look of frozen suffering was not something you saw everywhere . Mr. Clive , carefully ignoring Mr. Plassey , leaned forward . " As we explained to you earlier , Mrs. Lester ? " Mrs. Lester tossed her head . " Explanations ? You explained why you were n't going to do anything . Even after I told you what Steve really wanted . All you say is that you ca n't do anything . Do n't they , Daddy ? There must be something to do . This is n't fair . " Daddy , otherwise Mr. Trainor , was torn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he had to deprecate such feminine illogic . On the other hand , he , too , did not think it was fair . He cleared his throat and , in a grave baritone , said : " Now Mandy , honey , do n't get yourself upset  --  not on top of everything else . " Amanda set her jaw . Her father turned to the lawyers . " But , Clive , I admit I do n't see why we do n't have a strong case . After all , Amanda is the widow . Steve had n't seen these other people for years . " " Oh dear , it 's all so terrible . " Amanda 's mother lapsed into gentle sniffing and dabbed at her eyes . It was not emotional  | abandon but it was too much for Amanda . She jumped to her feet to get a cigarette from the small china cup on the mantle . If she had said it aloud , it could not have been more emphatic : " Oh , Mother ! " " There , there , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoulder . The lawyers surveyed the whole Trainor family with impartial hostility . Mr. Plassey , it seemed , had a shorter fuse than Mr. Clive . He eschewed the As I have explained before road . " It is certainly very unfortunate , " he said , closing his briefcase with a snap that made Thatcher wonder how long this consultation had been going on , " that Mr. Lester neglected to take the precaution of making a will . " " Better than vaudeville , " whispered Henry . For Mr. and Mrs. Trainor , as well as Amanda , took immediate exception to Plassey 's words . " I certainly do not think this is the time to be criticizing , " said Mrs. Trainor . " How could Steve imagine that that woman was going to go crazy ? " Amanda blazed out . " In the prime of life , " said Mr. Trainor meaninglessly but firmly . Both lawyers were human enough to glance involuntarily toward Thatcher and Henry . Then , glassy-eyed with control , they launched into a duet clearly performed at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attorneys on Monday morning ... " Possible compromise settlement . " " I will not compromise with that woman , " said Amanda awfully . " Look at their expressions , " said Henry softly . Thatcher had to do so quickly . Clive and Passey rose as one , delivered another round of instant counsel , then , with more haste than is usual , withdrew .  | They were probably not yet out of earshot , when Amanda spoke . " Daddy , I 'm going to get new lawyers . " " Now , baby , " he said , looking over his shoulder to be sure that the door had shut . Fortunately , at this juncture , Mrs. Trainor relapsed into her decorative sorrow . Mr. Trainor , the picture of masculine protectiveness , bowed his head over hers , then indicated to Amanda that he would take charge . He led his wife solicitously from the room . Was it base , Thatcher wondered , to suspect that the Trainors , like others , found Amanda rather overpowering ? Among those others , he decided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no real doubts . " It is all so unfair , " Amanda said , virtually ignoring her family 's retreat . " That woman ? " " You mean Mrs. Eunice Lester ? " Henry interjected . The lovely young face hardened . " Yes , I mean that bitch Eunice ! " In a world of four letter words , it is no novelty to hear young women use language that would have called forth apologies from their grandfathers . Thatcher was quite certain that Henry , who after all dealt with the public at large , regularly heard far worse . Nevertheless , he was not surprised to see Henry immediately become an eminent divine . " Now Mrs. Lester , " he said , more in sorrow than in anger . But Henry miscalculated . Amanda Lester never played audience to anybody else . Ignoring the Vicar of Wakefield , she said , " And  --  I just realized ! That explains it . " Suddenly her eyes shone with excitement . " When the police find out about this . . . " Caught between Henry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt bound to intervene . " The police probably already know about your husband 's estate , " he said . " Are you sure ? "  | There was a hungry note in Amanda 's voice that caused Henry to mutter something under his breath . Hurriedly , Thatcher tried to lead her away from this topic . " I should think so , Mrs. Lester . Now , we do n't wish to keep you from . . . er . . . your own concerns . We have intruded at this time simply to ask you about one small point . Your husband had an exchange of words with James Joel Finley . It 's a minor thing  --  but we were wondering if you knew anything about it . " " That 's right , " said Henry , who had forgotten all about Alec Prohack in the light of later developments . Amanda , too , had forgotten . " James Joel Finley ? " she repeated , not recognizing the name . Understandably enough , thought Thatcher . James Joel Finley , Fiord Haven , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , could now seem very remote . Except for the fact that Amanda Lester was not visibly numbed by her loss . If she was in the grip of any emotion , Thatcher was not convinced that it was grief . " Oh , you mean that architect up there , " she said after a moment or two . " I do n't really know . Steve did say something about the roof up at that lodge . I was n't really paying much attention ? " Henry momentarily put aside his colors as champion of Eunice and became Yankee sleuth , pure and simple . " You see , " he said earnestly , " witnesses have informed the police that Finley and your husband had a quarrel of some sort . Naturally , you can understand why we  --  they  --  want to track it down if we can ? " Amanda had put her money elsewhere . Bluntly , and quite honestly , Thatcher thought , she said , " But why on earth would anybody quarrel over a roof ? That 's just silly . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact , to the point of incapacity . With a quick signal , Thatcher kept Henry from continuing and indicated the desirability of departure .  | Amanda saw them to the door in some private fog , that did not altogether blanket her automatic responses to Henry 's courtesies . But even allowing for great emotional strain , thought Thatcher as they strode back to the car , it was striking how indifferent Amanda Lester seemed to everything concerning her husband 's death . Everything , that is , except Eunice . " All right , all right , " said Henry forthrightly when they were once again car-borne . " I apologize . It was a waste of time . I admit it . And damned unpleasant , to boot . " " Oh I do n't know , " said Thatcher slowly . Henry turned to glare at him . " Good God , John ! That selfish , cold-hearted  --  when I think of a woman like that trying to take Eunice 's boy  --  well , words fail me . " " I agree that it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that words would ever fail Henry . " I meant that it may not have been a waste of time . " There was silence while Henry digested this . Finally , finishing his review of the preceding hour , he said : " Exactly what do you mean by that ? " There are times when it is politic to dissimulate . So Thatcher was not being evasive when he tailored his reply . " Among other things , Henry , this roof business . If Lester argued with Finley about a roof  --  well , I , for one , think it might bear looking into . " Henry was projecting hopefulness . Thatcher continued . " As long as we 're down here , it might not do any harm to see Fiord Haven 's Boston operation . I think it might be useful to talk with Quinlan about James Joel Finley  --  among other things . " " That 's the spirit ! " Henry applauded . As Thatcher had feared , Henry thought he had recruited an ally .  | IF ANYBODY stood in need of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took charge of the sixth floor of the Sloan Guaranty Trust during Thatcher 's absences , was currently beleaguered . The State Banking Commission had forwarded a second communication to the Sloan ; the stock market was seesawing up and down wildly ; the air conditioning of the Sloan 's magnificent new temple on Exchange Place had developed a kink during one of New York 's brutal autumn heat waves . Even Charlie , a congenital optimist , had to concede that the situation was deteriorating . While inadequate fans blew documents off desks , the trust officers were showing the strain . Their combativeness was no less exacerbating for remaining perfectly polite . " . now Chet , the way I read the situation , there 's a possibility of a sixty percent drop in GGB . . .

" Walter Bowman , enormous in shirt sleeves , resembled an outraged Kodiak bear . " Way off ? Let me tell you ?

" . . . said it once , and I shall say it again . " " What was that , Ev ? " asked Charlie , insincerely responsive . Everett was at his bleakest . " The State Banking Commission , " he said icily . " You have seen the latest questionnaire , I trust ? " Charlie groaned to himself . " Sure , I 've seen it , Ev . I ca n't waste time on routine . I 've been pretty busy trying to figure out what 's up with the market . You know , according to the random-walk boys ? " Everett Gabler was not interested in the random-walk boys . " I do n't believe I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I feel strongly that we should discuss the entire matter . " " Sure , sure , " said Charlie , swallowing other retorts . The next forty-five minutes were not made easier for him by Everett 's open contempt for the fans and iced drinks showing how Charlie had knuckled under to the environment . When Charlie entered John Thatcher 's office a little later , he felt entitled to relax . " Whew ! " he said , settling himself in a chair . " I feel like a lion tamer . " Miss Corsa waited for something more specific . " Still , we may get through the day without anybody actually taking a punch at anybody else , " said Charlie brightening as he always did . " I defy John to do better . Rose , do we have any idea when they 're going to get that air conditioning working ? " Miss Corsa , ignoring allusions to Mr. Thatcher and to fisticuffs at the Sloan , was cooperative about the common enemy . The Sloan 's maintenance engineer reported that a flaw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by morning . Then , since she was only human , she added that the U.S. Weather Bureau predicted that the heat wave would break some eight hours earlier . " Naturally , " said Charlie . " Just pray that the market does n't break , too . You said that John called ? Where is he ? I thought he was far , far away  --  on some mountain or other . "  | Miss Corsa had no information on Mr. Thatcher 's whereabouts . " But , " she went on , " he told me to ask you and Mr. Bowman for some details . " Meticulously she consulted her dictation book , and Charlie listened to a hodgepodge of items that Mr. Thatcher would like the staff to check : there were inquiries for banks in California ; there were the names of New York specialists in second-home building ; there were legal opinions concerning the custody laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts . " I 'll start rounding things up , " said Charlie good-naturedly . " But what do you think he wants them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guess , but she did not feel it her place to do so . Charlie continued : " Of course there was that trouble up in New Hampshire , was n't there ? " " Yes , " said Miss Corsa . News of Stephen Lester 's murder had filtered down to the Sloan , but not enough to give it much prominence . " I thought John and this Henry Morland only stuck around long enough to call the police , " Charlie muttered , studying his notes . " Oh well , maybe John just got interested . After all , what else can you do when you 're tramping through the woods ? He probably just wants something to pass the time . I 'll see what I can dig up , Rose . . . " Charlie left behind him a deeply suspicious Miss Corsa . Like everybody else at the Sloan , Miss Corsa respected Mr. Thatcher 's passion for factual minutia and had interpreted his telephone message in that spirit . But the picture Mr. Trinkam painted brought her to her senses . Experience had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be tramping away from anything that interested him . Mr. Thatcher , of course , was not tramping through the woods . He was alighting from a cab in Kenmore Square , Boston .  | While Henry engaged in complex severance pay negotiations with the cabby , Thatcher inspected his surroundings . Kenmore Square , like most of downtown Boston , had been affected by two great forces . Affluence was evidenced by new fagades on old buildings , by a large glass and concrete motor-hotel , by boutiques and coffeehouses . Yesterday 's baby boom , however , had produced the streams of college students now surging in and out of the vast Bauhaus compounds of Boston University . " Highway robbery , " reported Henry cheerfully , as the taxi pulled away . " Literally or figuratively ? " Thatcher inquired , but Henry , hot on the trail , did not dissipate energy . " There it is , " he said , hurling himself across waves of miniskirts , blue jeans , long hair , and sandals . Obediently , Thatcher followed . NORTHERN LAND DEVELOPMENT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , six steps down . Its immediate neighbors were a liquor store and something called Uhuru , Inc. , which seemed to specialize in objects made of wicker , leather or polystyrene  --  or some combination of the three . FIORD HAVEN said a magenta and saffron poster . A NEW CONCEPT IN COUNTRY LIVING . Next to it was a large-scale model Of YOUR VACATION DREAM HOME , cross-sectioned so that one could study the cathedralceilinged living room , the fur rugs , the freestanding fireplace . It was furnished down to a ski rack in the hallway complete with skis . Finally , there was an enormous photographic mural with four panels : MAGIC SEASONS AT FIORD HAVEN . But Henry was not the man to linger over imaginative renderings Of SUMMER FUN ON FIORD LAKE , Or WINTRY WONDER AT FIORD MOUNTAIN . He trotted down the stairs , and Thatcher followed him into an office which consisted of six desks , each deep in brochures and folders . The occupants of each desk were either scanning lists , typing furiously or hunching over a telephone .  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up inquiringly . " Is Mr. Quinlan available ? " Henry began . He discovered that informality reigned at Northern Land Development as insistently as at Fiord Haven . " Phil ! " the young woman called to a neighbor . " Is Eddie back from the Sheraton yet ? " Phil cupped a hand over the phone . " Yeah , " he said . " Got back while you were getting coffee . Yes indeed , Mrs. Bell . No , of course there is absolutely no obligation . We just want you and Mr. Bell to see . . . " The young woman pointed to the rear of the room . " That 's Eddie 's door , " she informed them before returning to her work . Fortunately , before Thatcher and Henry could debate the propriety of marching in unannounced and possibly unwelcome , the door opened . Eddie Quinlan himself appeared . " Say , Frank , has anybody double-checked with the hotel about honoring the parking tickets ? We do n't want to have anybody charged for parking tonight the way they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Eddie , " said a voice from behind Thatcher and Henry . Ralph Valenti had entered on their heels . He pumped hands , then led the way . " Be with you in a minute , " said Quinlan who was bending over the desk and studying a much penciled chart . " Better arrange to have another table available if we should need it , Max . " Valenti hung his coat on a rack and gestured his guests into the inner office . It was a spartan affair of table-desks , a sofa , a large round conference table , and colorful FIORD HAVEN posters on the walls . A wastebasket near them bristled with rolls of blueprints . " Eddie , " Valenti said as Quinlan joined them , " before I forget . The Davidsons are coming tonight . "  | Quinlan grinned . " We 're going to end up feeding those kids forever . Maybe she has n't learned how to cook yet . " Valenti , settling himself across from their guests , was serious . " Remember , we did decide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Center . Of course , only if they 're really good prospects for Fiord Haven . " Okay , okay , " said Quinlan . By now , both Henry and Thatcher realized that their descent had coincided with one of Fiord Haven 's non-stop promotional efforts . A question from Henry gave them the dimensions ; two hundred prospects  --  this time invited on the basis of safe-deposit boxes in selected Boston banks , Eddie having a nephew in the commissioner 's office  --  were to be Fiord Haven 's guests at dinner tonight , in the Sheraton Hotel at the Prudential Center . " . . . and after dinner , " Valenti finished , " we 're showing a new film we 've just got . Eddie , did you get Sid to run it for you ? " Eddie nodded . " Great , " he said . Valenti agreed . " Sid 's got a lot of talent . " Neither Quinlan nor Valenti was curious about their visitors , and Thatcher knew why . This whirlwind of details to be checked , of arrangements to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be contacted , was no last-minute push . It was the way business was regularly done at Northern Land Development . Tomorrow would see no letdown ; the phones would still be ringing , as the one on Quinlan 's desk was ringing now . The young men outside would be going over other lists , making other calls . What with dinners and films , with weekends and ads , time cost more at Fiord Haven than at most places . This was a pace John Thatcher had seen in other operations . He was not hidebound enough to think that the Sloan 's was the only way to do business . So , he did not conclude , as many of his Wall Street colleagues would have , that this was commercially suspect . Hard sells and strong pitches have earned a bad name , but Thatcher could list many respectable and pro-  | fitable firms  --  from encyclopedia publishers to mutual funds ? that relied on them . It was , however , a way of doing business that left Quinlan and Valenti with no time and no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves on this assembly line . They had too many other claims on their attention . " Feldman , " Quinlan reported as he left the phone . " The Rentners have just signed . " " Good ! " cried Valenti . Thatcher would have liked to have known how many of Fiord Haven 's lots were sold . But , he thought , he was more likely to get a realistic answer from one of Charlie Trinkam 's contacts than from either of these frenetic promoters . Henry felt no qualms . " Did you sell any lots to the crowd at Fiord Haven the weekend they found Lester 's body ? " " Not so far , " said Quinlan with that sardonic smile . " There were a lot of second thoughts . " Valenti did not enjoy gallows humor . " The Davidson couple , " he said , almost vehement , " they 're really interested . " The partners were strongly contrasted , Thatcher thought , as Henry finally launched into an intricate explanation of their interest in James Joel Finley . Quinlan was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a taut air that was not , Thatcher would guess , the result of business pressures . Fiord Haven kept him busy , on the phone , planning , scheming , persuading  --  but Thatcher 's impression was that he would be doing just that anyway . Valenti was something else again . Unlike Quinlan , he did not evince nervous exhilaration . He was tired and , when tired , he became depressed behind his mask of easy cheer . It cost him an effort to keep his attention concentrated on the task of selling Fiord Haven . He did it because success would make him rich . And , Thatcher suspected , he might become one of the many rich men who discover they have sacrificed too much for wealth .  | " . . . discussion between Lester and Finley , " Henry was saying with elaborate nonchalance . " Something about the roof . . . " A troubled look between Quinlan and Valenti indicated that he had touched a sensitive spot . Speaking with clipped care , Quinlan said , " I 'm not sure that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Morland . " Henry dismissed this . " The police told me all about it , " he said , conveniently forgetting it had been Alec Prohack , not the police . But , since it was Prohack who had probably informed the police , it no doubt all came to the same thing in Henry 's mind . And Thatcher was not sure that he was far wrong at that . Quinlan was still frowning in thought . Valenti , however , was not a man to keep his own counsel . He made an indeterminate , unhappy sound . Thatcher thought that a nudge would do it . " Tell me , have they resumed work on your lodge yet ? " he asked . Valenti looked even unhappier and , for once , there was no smile on Quinlan 's face as he replied , " You know just as much as we do . " Having let down his guard , he continued , " I do n't know what the hell it means . First , Finley 's suddenly got to make some changes , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this story about Lester chewing him out because of the roof . " " What is the matter with the roof ? " Henry interrupted to ask . " Finley wanted to make some design changes , " Valenti answered vaguely . Eddie Quinlan was not vague . " Nothing 's the matter with it , " he said with a snap . " We sent a construction engineer up to Fiord Haven this morning to make sure . " A nasty implication , Thatcher thought . Ralph Valenti still intended to defend Fiord Haven and everyone associated with it . " The police are crazy , " he said . " James Joel Finley is a world-famous architect . He could n't ? " Eddie Quinlan 's defensive instincts were more finely-honed.  | " James Joel Finley is n't Fiord Haven . And Fiord Haven is guaranteeing that everything built up there is first-class . " Unspoken was his corollary : If James Joel Finley had anything to do with Stephen Lester 's murder , that was his problem , not Fiord Haven 's . Henry did not leave things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Finley is implicated ? " This bluntness made poor Valenti choke . Quinlan only smiled and said , " It would hurt . We 've featured James Joel Finley in all our promotion . And hell  --  this has got to be some mix-up . To show you what we think  --  well , Finley 's coming to the dinner tonight . But , in the last analysis , if worst comes to worst  --  well , Fiord Haven is n't selling because of any architect . " This cool optimism depressed Valenti still further . He struggled to remain as detached as Quinlan . " Do you know if the police seriously suspect Finley ? " he asked Henry . Henry was not quick enough off the mark . Once again , Quinlan 's guard slipped . " Ralph , " he said , " forget about what the police are doing . They can take care of their business , and we should concentrate on ours  --  which is Fiord Haven . " " I know , I know , " Valenti said , troubled . " But I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's not easy , " Quinlan said . " Hell , I 'm just as bad as you are . This afternoon , when we 've got a million things to do , I went out of my way to try to help Mrs. Lester . " He glanced at Thatcher and Morland , including them in his comment . " And it was a mistake . A waste of time . So I 've learned my lesson . None of this is our business . The police will take care of it  --  and we 'll go on selling Fiord Haven . " Before they could see if Valenti had been convinced , the phone rang again . A young woman opened the door and demanded an instant decision about radio spots on WHDH . " You see what I mean ? " Quinlan said . The selling effort of Fiord Haven had a momentum of its own . Thatcher and Henry withdrew .  | Kenmore Square was a riot of snarled traffic and bad-tempered jaywalkers . Henry ignored both . " Do you believe that ? " he asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to help Eunice ? " He was disappointed when Thatcher replied temperately that he did not know . " And as for forgetting about the murder . " Henry continued with scorn . " If Quinlan and Valenti can forget about the murder , " Thatcher agreed , " then they will be the only ones who can . "  | THATCHER AND Henry set off on foot for the Ritz where they had reserved rooms for the night . Henry , engaged in internal struggle , remained silent . Thatcher was not surprised . Henry had come gallivanting down from New Hampshire with high hopes of unmasking Lester 's murderer . By now those hopes had been dashed . " I suppose , " said Henry suddenly , " that we should take Quinlan 's advice ourselves . " Thatcher abandoned the scenery on Commonwealth Avenue for his companion . " I mean , " said Henry doggedly , " we should probably forget about the murder . Get back up to the Trail . " " This does n't sound like you , Henry , " said Thatcher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power , " said Henry with dignity . " I shall put the matter entirely from my mind . " And , for the rest of the afternoon , he did . James Joel Finley was not so fortunate . He would have given his eye teeth to forget Stephen Lester and Fiord Haven . But it was not possible . Even while Henry and Thatcher were strolling back to the Ritz , Finley was descending on the premises of Northern Land Development . His initial reception was flattering . James Joel Finley was the nearest thing to distinction ever to have visited that office  | and he commanded the devotion of the entire clerical staff . Like acolytes , young girls swarmed around him ready to anticipate his wishes , run his errands and provide for his comfort . Normally , Finley relished this round-eyed homage . Today , it interfered with his plans . " I told Mr. Valenti 's secretary that you had to speak with him , " a messenger reported . " But she said he 's in conference with Mr. Quinlan about our radio promotion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out for you , Mr. Finley , " the girl volunteered . Finley was gracious . " That wo n't be necessary , my dear . " " I 'd tell him it was important , " she persisted . " No ! I do n't want to make an issue of it . " Finley heard the snap in his voice and recovered control . His smile was strained . " I can very profitably use the time myself . I have some telephoning to do . " This evasion merely produced another assistant . " Oh , Mr. Finley , I 'll put through your calls for you , " said a small pert redhead . " I 'm going on at the switchboard now . " Finley , with that old-world courtesy that had won him his admirers , took an elbow in either hand and ushered both girls to the door . " No , no , " he said , indulgently firm , " these are private calls . " Amanda Lester , whatever her faults , was nobody 's acolyte . " No , Daddy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to handle this myself . " Her father stared in astonishment . In twenty-six years Amanda had never done anything for herself . To the best of his knowledge she had never even contemplated doing so . If there was one thing he and Rosemary prided themselves on , it was bringing up a simple , old-fashioned girl . " Now , honey , " he began uneasily , " do you think Steve would have liked to see you acting this way ? "  | Amanda 's reply was withering . " Steve is n't here to see how I 'm acting . He 's dead , remember ? " David Trainor 's face went blank . He thinks I 'm being brutal , she thought suddenly . He does n't realize I 'm just being realistic . The trouble , she knew , was that her father could n't believe she was a widow . He saw her as a child . By stretching , he could make it a young bride . But that was as far as he could go . Probably nobody considered a woman adult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's fault , " she said obscurely . " You know it is . " " Well , we ca n't be certain about that , can we ? " her father temporized . His voice assumed a specious authority . " The police will find out who murdered Steve , Mandy . Let them do it their own way . " " Their own way ! You saw that letter from California . Somebody 's been digging up that old marijuana party . You know it was Eunice . She 's probably giving the police an earful . And you expect me to take that lying down ? " She glared . Mr. Trainor was helpless . Amanda was making him remember that terrible time with the call from the police station at three o'clock in the morning . They had Mandy  --  his Mandy ? in a cell . All his instincts were to forget that night as completely as possible . Meanwhile , Amanda was acting . She dialed a number scribbled on a pad . As she waited for the connection , she turned to her father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threateningly , " do n't tell Mother . " Then the receiver squeaked and her voice held nothing but hard impatience . " This is Mrs. Amanda Lester . Please put me through to Mr. Quinlan , at once . "  | Eddie Quinlan hung up the receiver and stared at it incredulously . Then he shook his head and blinked once before speaking . " Either she 's going crazy , or I am . " Ralph Valenti looked more worried than ever . " That was Amanda Lester , was n't it ? " " She 's coming to the Pru , " Eddie said baldly . " My God ! " Valenti exploded . " Who was fool enough to ask her ? " Quinlan shrugged . " No one as far as 1 know . " " Her husband was just murdered the other day . " Valenti 's ideas of decorum were shaken . " That girl does n't know how to behave . This is no time for a widow to be coming to parties . " Quinlan leaned back in his chair and stared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not out for pleasure . She says she has to speak to us urgently . So that we can straighten out our stories to the police . " " Another one ! " The shadows were back on Valenti 's face . " That 's all I need . " " Ralph , we 've got to handle her carefully . She may have come up with something new . She sounds as if she 's nerving herself for something . " " I say we should n't have anything to do with her , " Valenti said stubbornly . " She 's a troublemaker . " Quinlan looked up swiftly . He heard a new note in Valenti 's voice . " Everything 's up to you , Ralph . I 'll let you call the shots . " " If it were n't for Fiord Haven ? " Valenti was fervent . " Fiord Haven means a lot to you , does n't it , Ralph ? " Quinlan asked seriously . " It means everything . " Eunice Lester was staring hopelessly across the table at Peter Vernon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I do n't understand you , Eunice , " he was saying . " I really do n't . Of course , the whole thing is unpleasant , there 's no de-  | nying it . But your problems are over . It would be silly not to recognize that . In the long run , this makes things easier for you . " " Easier ? " Eunice gasped , hysteria nearly displacing the sarcasm she intended . Vernon 's slow , grave explanation did not falter . " Yes . This means an end to that custody suit . I never did like the idea of going into court . " " I told you I was taking care of that , " Eunice said abruptly . " Of course . But this solves everything . " " Does it occur to you , Peter darling , " Eunice asked with dangerous sweetness , " that the police are arguing along exactly the same lines ? In their eyes , it gives me a motive for murdering Steve . " " That 's nonsense , " Peter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves . " Oh , thought Eunice , if only she knew what Peter was really thinking ! Was he being tactful ? Was he being sincere ? Was there new reserve in his attitude toward her ? It did not help that his avowed opinion was that she was a creature of unbridled passion . Until two weeks ago , this assessment had been flattering . But now ? This was no time to resemble a tigress lashing her tail . Consciously she tried to create an atmosphere of cool , common sense . " I 'd like them to see it as soon as possible , " she said calmly . Peter was reassured . " Then the thing to do is cooperate when they ask for cooperation . Otherwise , have nothing to do with the whole affair . Forget about it as much as possible . It 's not as if you were involved . " Eunice flinched . There was a shade of reserve in his last statement . She played her trump card . " Not involved ! Do you realize that it was Tommy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tommy is old enough to read newspapers ? That he knows his mother is a murder suspect ? " Now she did not attempt to control the trembling in her voice .  | Her attack put Vernon on the defensive . He was a widower who had been married for twenty years . He knew about feminine nerves ; furthermore he respected all displays of maternal anxiety . For the next ten minutes Peter Vernon was unstinting with both apologies and reassurances . When he had gone , Eunice cleared away the glasses and decided she was a fool . Why were all the men in her life totally without protective instincts ? For that matter , what was the deep similarity which made them all demand their eggs scrambled hard ? And , most unanswerable of all , why was life a vacuum unless there was a man to cook scrambled eggs for ? What she needed was a man who ate in restaurants and was occasionally of some help to her . Someone she could turn to when she needed . . . Suddenly she stopped emptying an ashtray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name came to mind . " Of course , " she whispered to herself . Eunice was not the only one having trouble with her man . " I tell you , Alan , " Sukey declared , " it could be important ! " " I did n't say it was n't important , " Alan replied bearishly . " I said we should n't get mixed up with the police . " " You make it sound as if we were going to live with them . I just think they ought to know . I could stop by the station house tomorrow morning . For heaven 's sake , Alan , if you like it better , I could write to the police up in New Hampshire . " " The fuzz are the fuzz anywhere , " Alan declaimed , " and you know how we feel about them . " Sukey did indeed know . Had they not both belonged to SDS at Brandeis ? " That 's different , Alan . We do n't believe in allowing police on campus ; we do n't believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because they 're acting beyond their jurisdiction . But the New Hampshire police have a right to investigate a murder in New Hampshire , do n't they ? "  | The voice of sweet reason was making Alan sullen . He had a grudge against the New Hampshire State Police . Never had he recoiled from flying wedges of police , from nightsticks , from riot cars . But he had been disoriented that day on the Appalachian Trail , spiritually as well as geographically . He had greeted the police as deliverers . He had meekly answered all their questions . He had not once reminded them that he was too socially responsible to allow them to jackboot their way across his civil rights . They had tarnished his image of Alan Davidson , and he was n't going to forgive that easily . He shifted ground . " What difference would it make if they knew ? " he demanded . " It does n't change anything . " " Oh , yes , it does , " Sukey said roundly . " Mr. Valenti was n't scheduled to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ murdered . But somehow he changed the schedule around . You can see why he did it . He did n't expect the murder to be discovered so soon , and he wanted an alibi for that night . " " You 're just imagining all that . Anyway , if the police are so bright , they 'll find out themselves . We are n't the only ones who know , and I do n't like the idea of being a patsy for the fuzz . " Sukey sat up straight . " And I do n't like being a patsy for a murderer ! If you want to know , I liked Captain Frewen ! " Alan sucked in his breath sharply . He did not realize he was witnessing a development foreseen by someone else a long time ago . Sukey as campus radical had appalled her father , dismayed her faculty adviser , and terrorized her roommate . Sukey 's mother , however , had  --  in her husband 's opinion  --  remained preternaturally placid . She had made one visit to SDS headquarters and noted the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's sincerity for a moment , she had decided that nature , as usual , had found the shortest distance between two points . The path was tiresome , of course . But a good deal less tiresome than young couples throbbing sympathetically to Maeterlinck 's Blue Bird , which had been the path obligatory for nineteenth-century romantics .  | " Sukey will grow out of it , " she had assured her fulminating husband . She might have added that the growing-out process would furnish Alan with the education he had missed in college . Alan 's reaction to this opportunity was momentarily deferred . Just as he was about to castigate Sukey as a cop lover , an establishment hireling and an apostate , the phone rang . He knew something was up when he heard her young-matron tone . " Yes , this is Mrs. Davidson . . . why , Mr. Finley ! Of course I 'll help . " Henry Morland continued his demonstration of the power of mind over matter during the walk to the Ritz . He raised , discussed , and dropped many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lester or murder . By the time he had said what little there is to be said about the space program , water pollution and the urban crisis , Thatcher was regretting the old , unregenerate Henry . He was relieved , therefore , when a telephone call removed Henry from the Ritz 's cocktail lounge , and even more relieved when Henry returned to announce : " Sorry to run out on you , John , but I felt that I might as well make up for wasted time . " " Yes ? " Thatcher inquired . " We 'll get back on the Trail tomorrow , " said Henry , in what seemed to be a non sequitur . " Fine , " said Thatcher . " So tonight , I thought I 'd get a little business done , if you 'll excuse me . " Henry had made an appointment for dinner and a business talk with an artisan in Roxbury who had developed an interesting new technique for producing wormholes in wood . " Fake antiques , Henry ? " " Certainly not , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are modern pieces and price them accordingly . What people tell their neighbors when they get them home  --  that 's up to them . " With Henry off on this new wrinkle in duplicity , Thatcher  | consulted his conscience . A rapid review of many professional and personal contacts in Boston and Cambridge produced only one obligation so overriding that he was helpless before it . Supported by a first-rate meal , Thatcher took to his feet again , this time to Beacon Hill . Beacon Hill is no longer the home of the Brahmans , but it remains a good address in a more eclectic sense than it once did . Many of the homes built for an Otis or a Bancroft are now devoted to good works , like the American Girl Scouts , the Red Cross , and , up on Joy Street , the Appalachian Mountain Club . But here and there are some vestiges of a golden past . One of them , a house on Cedar Street , was Thatcher 's immediate goal . He was paying an evening call on Mr. and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Thatcher now , and for many years past , had nothing in common . And yet , he reflected as he plodded across the Public Gardens , the years had provided their cement . Mrs. Thorndike had been godmother to Thatcher 's late wife . So , she and her husband had sent a very handsome wedding present . Silver , Thatcher seemed to remember . Laura , his daughter , must have it now . They had sent equally handsome presents for the birthdays and weddings of each of the Thatcher children . They had often dined with the Thatchers before one of their regular voyages to Europe . And they had , although quite elderly by then , attended the funeral . It was nothing in common , Thatcher realized , or alternatively a lifetime in common . The melancholy tenor of his thoughts was sharply terminated by the Forbes Thorndikes themselves . In earlier years , they had seemed simply indeterminate . Now in their nineties , they were reverting to type with a certain astringency . They were also unaffectedly and unsentimentally pleased to welcome Thatcher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its kitchen garden , and its authentic violet windows . Quite contrary to his expectations , John Putnam Thatcher  | spent a thoroughly entertaining evening . Although advanced in years , Forbes and Abigail Thorndike retained full possession of their faculties . Furthermore , a far-sighted nineteenth-century Thorndike was still contributing to their comfort . Not only was there a staff to keep the sideboards dusted and the flower vases filled , there was a housekeeper with a nursing degree . " Quinlan ? Quinlan ? " asked Forbes Thorndike , pouring brandy with a hand as steady of a youth 's . " Edward J. Quinlan , " said Thatcher who had described his visit to Boston in anecdotal , but accurate , terms . " And a Ralph Valenti ? " Forbes Thorndike snorted . " Sounds like an election ticket . Get an Italian from the North End and somebody green ? " Abigail Thorndike could give her husband a year or two , but she ventured farther from Cedar Street these days than he did . " There is a Quinlan who was head of the Port @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " If it was n't a Quinlan , " Forbes said , " it was a Flynn . Have I ever told you , John , about that lunch I had with Mayor Curley ? " He had , but Thatcher listened again . Or half listened . There was something timeless about the Thorndikes , frail as they now were . He was glad to have lived in at least part of their era . Once they were gone , their like would not be seen again . Their own children , Thatcher knew , did not resemble them in the least . One was a lawyer on State Street whose entire professional career consisted of lending the luster of his name and connections to firms where the real work was done by others  --  others frequently named Quinlan or Flynn . The Thorndike girl , although she must be a grandmother by now , had married somebody named Swenson and made a life for herself in Minneapolis . But with the Thorndikes senior , in their house on Cedar Street that was not much changed since the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the triviality , even the  | ephemerality , of the most painful hornet 's nest of the moment . Henry notwithstanding . Thatcher , matching Forbes brandy for brandy , found himself mellowly reflecting that by tomorrow afternoon , or the day after at the latest , he would be back on the Appalachian Trail . Stephen Lester would be one more ripple in the placid ocean of time . . . Strong drink is a deceiver . At just about the time Forbes Thorndike was rounding out his story ( " . . . beautiful voice . . . would you believe it , I had tears in my eyes when he sang My Wild Irish Rose ' " ) , life in the New Boston was proceeding apace . In the special function room of the Sheraton Hotel at the Prudential Center , the lights went up . Sukey Davidson loosed a scream that bounced off the walls like a fusillade . " Look , " she gurgled before collapsing into Alan 's arms . For , after the movie , Fiord Haven  --  Your All-Season Home , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sukey put an end to the blinking . All eyes swerved to the man she was pointing at . He lay slumped forward like a drunk , hands aimlessly dangling . But he was not drunk . From his back projected one of the Sheraton 's long , sharp carving knives .  | IGNORANCE IS bliss . The dramatic events occurring at one hotel in Boston did not disturb John Putnam Thatcher 's slumbers at another . Protected by his dislike of pre-breakfast television , he sallied forth the next morning in search of nourishment . The dining room of the Ritz in Boston is on the second floor . Its spacious elegance includes a wall of windows overlooking the Public Gardens and Boston Common . On a clear , sunny morning in late September it seems suspended among the treetops , the multi-colored leaves affording glimpses of gliding swan boats and frolicking children . Idyllic , thought John Thatcher approvingly , as he laid down his morning papers and prepared to join Henry Morland , who was already at a corner table . Thatcher himself was flushed with the sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a night of refreshing repose . He gave his order to a hovering waiter , picked up The New York Times and , as befitted his calling in life , turned to the financial page . Here he remained engrossed by Dow-Jones averages until his orange juice arrived . Casually he glanced up . Instantly he realized that something was wrong . Henry , like many men of small , wiry build , had a ferocious appetite . Normally he approached the breakfast table like a powerful vacuum cleaner , absorbing every crumb of toast , scrap of marmalade , or pat of butter within reach . But not 135  | today . He was still broodily pecking at the same egg which had been occupying him five minutes earlier . " John , " he asked plaintively , " are n't you ever going to turn to the news ? " Deferring useless questions , Thatcher unfurled the front page . It held no surprises for him . The peace talks were bogged down , salvos has been exchanged across the Suez Canal , and the trade unions in England @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Britain 's flagging economy . Henry used his knife as a pointer . " The other one , " he directed . The Boston Globe had apparently abandoned the international situation . A two-column spread , in tones not far removed from hysteria , described a local event : MURDER AT THE PRU BUSINESSMAN STABBED TO DEATH Fiord Haven 's Second Killing BOSTON , September 12-Yesterday evening at the Sheraton Hotel in the Prudential Center , Ralph G. Valenti , a prominent Boston realtor , was stabbed to death . The murder occurred during a hospitality evening sponsored by Fiord Haven , a resort community in New Hampshire of which Valenti was a promotor . Last Saturday , Stephen Lester , a business executive from Weston , Mass. , was murdered at Fiord Haven during a weekend organized for prospective residents . Over a hundred people were present last night at the dinner and subsequent film showing which culminated in the discovery of Valenti 's body . Valenti was stabbed in the back with a carving knife while the lights were out in the special function room . At the conclusion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alan Davidson of  | Cambridge who was sitting next to Valenti . " It was just awful , " Mrs. Alan Davidson told our reporter . " The lights went on and I heard Alan kind of choke , so I turned around and I saw him . " But the Boston Globe was not prepared to waste time on Sukey Davidson-or , indeed , on any of the participants . Its passions had been roused by the desecration of the Prudential Center . The financial history of the complex was recalled . Its dimensions were retailed with pride . The urban renewal unleashed by its erection was painstakingly reviewed . At the bottom of the page , Thatcher was not much wiser than at the end of the second paragraph . He looked at Henry inquiringly . " Turn to page nine , " said the martyr 's voice . On page nine , it all came out . Among those present , Thatcher learned , were Mrs. Amanda Lester , widow of Stephen Lester , Mrs. Eunice Lester , ex-wife of Stephen Lester , James Joel Finley , prominent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mill in Pepperton , New Hampshire . " So that was your business appointment last night , " said Thatcher , unable to mount much surprise . Somehow it was inevitable that , if the personnel of Fiord Haven were to be assassinated , Henry would manage to be on the spot . " I went with Eunice , " Henry confessed . " Who cares what your excuse was ? Have you told Ruth ? " " I called her this morning . " " And ? " " Women , " Henry complained evasively , " get so excited . " Sternly Thatcher tried to suppress the memory of Ruth 's placidity in the face of Henry 's vagrant enthusiasms . Henry was continuing gloomily , " but she says Duncan is bound to find out . " Duncan was the eldest of the Morland children . He was thirty-five and putting on weight . Of late , he had begun to feel it was his duty to give his parents the benefit of his mature counsel .  | Thatcher cast around for comfort . " He 's not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offered . All three of Henry 's children were married , respectable and well-settled . Nonetheless they represented bitter failure . Henry had justified his move to New England many years ago on the grounds that the children could be raised close to nature . Accordingly , the three young Morlands had spent their high school and college vacations humping supplies up mountainsides , clearing trails , and instructing novices in the arts of the woodsman . Upon achieving emancipation , the three fled to large cities and established residence in skyscrapers . From these aeries , they were in the habit of extending warm invitations to their parents . Not one of them , so far as was known , had seen a blade of grass in years . " That wo n't stop Duncan from coming to Boston , " Henry pointed out . " Then leave Boston , " Thatcher said sharply . " I ca n't , " Henry groaned . " Not yet anyway . I have to turn up at some police station at eleven . " Thatcher had been hoping that Henry and Eunice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ providing each other with an alibi . He should have known better . " Perhaps , Henry , " he suggested , " you had better tell me about it . " With a coherence indicating he had already told the tale several times , Henry obliged . Thatcher gave him a lead . " Start by explaining why Eunice went . I thought she was through with Fiord Haven . " " It was a last-minute decision , " Henry replied . " She found out that Amanda was going . That made her nervous as hell . She figured something was up . After all , Amanda had a lot more reason to remain in seclusion than she did . So she decided Amanda was going to pull something , and she 'd better see what it was . " " Did Amanda pull anything ? " " Not unless she murdered Valenti . " Henry was dispirited.  | " Go on , " Thatcher directed . It developed that dinner had been served at an immense , U-shaped table . Old Fiord Haven prospects and new prospects had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They did not even spot Amanda until dinner was almost over . " And she was sitting with a bunch of strangers , too . Then , we were all herded into the next room to see movies . I was pretty disappointed . It looked as if we were going to sit through a couple of hours of sales pitch in the total dark , and that would be that . " Thatcher could imagine the frustration . Henry , of course , had sneaked off to this function in order to continue his detective activities among the participants of the murder weekend . Instead he had been forced to eat a bad dinner with strangers , then sit in silence for the remainder of the evening . " But things turned out not to be so bad . " Henry brightened at the memory . " I guess they figured that program would be too stiff to put people in the mood to buy . So they had a series of movies . Then , while the operator was changing reels , they brought in a trolley of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Thatcher nodded . He could see what was coming . " The first one they showed was a real shortie . Could n't have been more than a couple of minutes . It was about opening and closing one of their houses and how little there is to it . That time I went to the trolley and got drinks for us and came back to Eunice . She was talking to some couple from Newton . The second film was a ski movie . You know , filled with dramatic shots of some athlete pivoting in a spray of snow . That was n't too long , either , and the photography was interesting , " Henry said , giving credit where credit was due . " That time Eunice did n't want anything . So I went to get some soda water and I started to talk to one of those salesmen . Burt  --  you remember him . The lights went down while I was still talking to him , so I just took the first empty chair I could find . In the third film  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Year ' Round Fun in New Hampshire . It went on and on with a sound track . The pictures , naturally , had to be of some place else . I think they used a development that 's already open . But the track was . all about Fiord Haven . They told us how they had to choose between putting the houses close to the ski tow or close to the lake and how clever they 'd been to decide on the tow . That way people would n't have to get their cars started in the winter . They 'd be right there , close to the base of the runs . But what would be even better would be the summer . The lake was on the other side of the mountain and the kids would be using it all day with speed boats and water-skiing and lifeguards . It sounded like the prelude to hell , if you ask me , " Henry said , suddenly diverted . " They must think so , too , " Thatcher replied , " if they 're bragging about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to run a bus , right after breakfast . That way they figure to keep the kids out of everyone 's hair all day  --  or anyway until dinnertime . Meanwhile the parents get a heated pool with a clubhouse bar and no noise . Not a bad idea , " Henry said handsomely . " Keep to the point , " Thatcher growled , uninterested in Henry 's reaction . " What about Valenti 's murder ? " " After this thing had run on for what seemed like hours , the lights went up , people started to mill around and Sukey Davidson screamed . " Thatcher drew a deep breath at this dramatic termination of Henry 's recital . " I suppose the police have been concentrating on where people went between the films , " he said slowly . " Have they ever ! " Henry said feelingly . " Of course , at first , they were concentrating on Valenti 's movements , but that did n't help them much . You see , Valenti had been at the trolley with everyone else at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take a seat . He went and sat down next to the Davidsons long before they blacked out for the third movie . That was in the next-to-last row of chairs . Plenty of people had time to see i  | where he was and plenty of them did n't go back to their seats for more punishment until the lights went out . So almost anyone could have slipped into the last row , stabbed Valenti and then shuffled off to a seat on the other side of the room . " " Just what do you mean by that almost anyone , Henry ? Do you really mean the whole room of a hundred people was surging around ? " " Hell , no ! I suppose quite a few of them never got up at all . But you do n't have to be a mind reader to see how the cops are thinking . It 's only natural . The first thing they did was ask about the repeaters from the murder weekend . When they could n't produce anyone who held their hand throughout the entire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Henry spread his arms helplessly . " That boils down to Eunice , Amanda , me , Quinlan , that Finley , and a couple of the salesmen . A short , choice list ! " Thatcher abandoned his role as comforter in search of information . " What about the other people at Fiord Haven for the weekend ? " he demanded . " One of them could have been a long-lost enemy of Lester 's . And their alibis were all provided by spouses who were changing for dinner with them . You ca n't tell me the police have entirely lost interest in them . " " If they had n't before , they have now . " Henry was the picture of gloom . " None of them were at the Pru last night . " " Are you sure ? " Thatcher demanded . " After all , Valenti said they were letting in repeaters . Who made up last night 's list , anyway ? " " There seems , " said Henry temperately , " to be some question as to how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three hours later , that question was still not being answered . " I do n't care , " Amanda snapped defiantly . " I was n't going to attend . But when Sukey told me that woman was going , nothing could have stopped me . " It became apparent that her father , her mother , and her  | lawyers had certainly not been equal to the task . They had all tried ; they had all failed . When she left , Amanda was still breathing fire . The next witness had the same story . " I 've told you once . I 'll tell you again , " Eunice declared with iron control . " I had n't even heard about it until Mrs. Davidson told me that Mr. Finley had persuaded Amanda to go . Then I decided I 'd have to look after my interests . " Eunice had , at last , decided to produce support more effective than Henry 's had proven . She was accompanied by a lanternjawed attorney . But not by Peter Vernon . " But why are you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I just did what Mr. Finley asked . " Sukey was fighting on two fronts . In the intervals of fending off the police , she was trying to cope with reproaches from Alan . Why , he wanted to know , had n't she told James Joel Finley to run his own errands ? With burning indignation , she reminded her husband that he had been enormously pleased and flattered to learn that one of our well-known modern architects was looking to the Davidsons for assistance . Eddie Quinlan seemed past fighting . White with shock , he asked more questions than he answered . " You do n't have to tell me something 's been going on at Fiord Haven . I figured that out myself . But what the hell is it ? First this guy Lester  --  and now Ralph . . . " He listened to the police ask about the invitation list almost blankly . " I do n't know how those women got on the list . They were n't on it yesterday morning , I know that much . But anybody could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . Hell , maybe Ralph did . But one thing is sure  --  they did n't do it to help sell Fiord Haven . Who wants a bunch of widows around ? " Least temperate of all was Finley himself . " Well , Mr. Finley ? " the police asked with limitless patience . " They 're lying , " Finley said flatly . " I never talked to the Davidson girl . Why should I want Lester 's wives to come ? I do n't know what they 're up to , but they 're all lying . "  | The police produced Sukey Davidson 's statement . James Joel Finley had called her up and asked her to invite Eunice and Amanda Lester to Fiord Haven 's party . He had even told her how to bait the hook . " I know who I called and who I did n't . " Finley sounded more stubborn than ever . " It 's her word against mine . And besides , her story does n't make sense ! " Unemotionally , the police recorded his words . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the program for last night , Mr. Finley ? Do you deny you selected it ? " " Of course not , " he snapped . " What selecting there was , was done by me . We have a stable of fifteen or sixteen films . We always show a selection of three . I chose the three . " " So you knew there would be a lot of milling around ? " " I would have known that anyway . " Finley was snarling his defiance . " There always is . You ca n't keep people chained up for three films . " " And during that last film , Mr. Finley ? You did n't leave the drinks trolley until the lights went out ? " " The whole point of having a bar is to enable the Fiord Haven staff to socialize with the clients . We all exchange a few words with as many people as possible . " " So it would be very hard for anyone to say where you had been at any moment ? " Finley was beginning to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my actions look mysterious , when they were n't . Everything I did was predicated on an evening whose purpose was to bring together our guests and tell them about Fiord Haven . That was everyone 's reason for being there . " The policeman looked up . " Not this time , Mr. Finley . Someone had a very different reason this time . "  | IT IS one thing to be holed up in New Hampshire , as Thatcher informed Henry . Boston was something else again . " In fact , " he said , reaching for the phone , " unless you want me to go to the police station with you , I think I 'm going to let you stew in your own juice for a while . " Henry 's essential bounce had reasserted itself . No , he saw no need for Thatcher . But where , he asked , was John planning to spend the interval ? " New York , " said Thatcher , adding to himself that he could always fly back instantly if Henry got in over his depth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Henry , Thatcher decided on the shuttle flight to LaGuardia , was that he was such an unpredictable combination of the antic and the shrewd . It would have been satisfying to leave him in the dark . Unfortunately , Henry not only fathomed Thatcher 's intentions ; he approved of them . Thatcher had a strong presentiment that Ruth would not . Because Thatcher had decided to opt for some hard information . True to his instincts , he was sure that hard information would not come to light in Weston , in Arlington , in Boston or in New Hampshire . Hard information was to be found on Wall Street . It had not occurred to him that his arrival at the Sloan Guaranty Trust would require justification . " No , Miss Corsa , " he remarked casually . " I 'm just down for the day . Can you ask Bowman to drop by ? "  | " Certainly , Mr. Thatcher , " said Miss Corsa , somehow suggesting that she deplored his presence . Thatcher was mildly taken aback . Then , when Walter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bustled in , he was confronted with another trying response . " No , I 'm still on vacation , Walter , " Thatcher explained . " There were just one or two things . . . " But Bowman was still frowning . He was never happy until he had unraveled any small problem in his immediate vicinity and , for some reason , Thatcher 's appearance seemed to constitute such a problem . " Why did n't you call ? " he inquired , seeking enlightenment . John Putnam Thatcher prided himself on a firmly reined temper , but limitless patience had never been his forte . " Now listen , Walter , " he began . Bowman raised a pudgy hand . " I was just wondering , " he explained disarmingly . Thatcher , who had reason to value Walter 's disinterested passion for any and all information , was willing to accept this . " Fine , " he said crisply . " Now , what I want to know is this . . . " During the flight down , Thatcher had catalogued the areas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there were enough heated emotions and ambiguous personal relationships to keep Henry , and possibly the police , occupied for weeks . But to a banker , certain other questions leaped to mind quite automatically . In all honesty , Thatcher could not see that the answers would identify the double murderer . But given Henry , he knew he was going to be asked to think further about the murders of Stephen Lester and Ralph Valenti . He had decided to equip himself with some meaningful data . Unfortunately , assembling this data brought him into contact with more members of the Sloan family than Walter Bowman and Miss Corsa ; each of them , so it seemed to Thatcher , mildly questioned his appearance on the premises .  | " But I thought you could n't be reached , " exclaimed Everett Gabler . " Really , John , if I 'd known that you were coming in , I would never have allowed Charlie to send that memorandum to the State Banking Commission . I thought at the time , and I still feel , that it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . Charlie took the larger view . " You mean , after all this , you 're going back up north tomorrow ? You 're still going on with that hike ? Boy , John  --  okay , okay . But before you go , it would be a big help if you tried talking to Everett about this Banking Commission testimony . . . Bradford Withers , the eminent world traveler and president of the Sloan , simply looked hard at his senior vice president . " Thought you were away , " he said . Or accused . It was a lesson learned , Thatcher concluded ruefully several hours later . Either he was at the helm of the Sloan or he was not . Clearly , his subordinates and colleagues  --  and Miss Corsa , who was in a category apart  --  were not happy with a John Putnam Thatcher present at the Sloan but not setting the course . Although he was soberly attired , he might just as well have come clumping into the Trust Department in hiking boots and backpack . Henry Morland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liked their firmaments well charted . So , since Thatcher was both thoughtful of the comfort of others and interested in the efficiency of the Sloan , he removed himself as rapidly as possible to the privacy of his apartment in the Devonshire . There could be no doubt , he realized as he left Miss Corsa straightening the chaos he had introduced onto his desk , that his departure was a great relief to all concerned . " About the schedule of where you can be reached . . . ? " Miss Corsa said half-heartedly as Thatcher reached the door . He braked . " I do n't know , Miss Corsa . We 'll probably have to cut short some of the trip . I 'll call in  --  at intervals . " It was a pleasure to get back at least some of his own , he reflected , as the elevator bore him streetward.  | At his apartment , he dismissed this petty triumph and concentrated on what the Sloan and other sources had brought to light . At first glance , it did not amount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trinkam and Walter Bowman had been helpful . " Boy , is that a wide open field , " said Charlie . " You know , these second homes are selling like hotcakes . And the latest thing is this development bit . Hundreds of them . We own Buller Corp. , out in Washington , and Orlando Homes in Flor-ida ? " " But you 've got to pick the company carefully , " Walter interrupted . " There are all kinds . You know  --  developments aimed at older people . Or second homes for skiers  --  or swimmers . There are private clubs and public resorts . There are lots of different gimmicks . But you have to be careful . " Walter Bowman realized that his companions knew this much and more . He was simply warming to his subject . Charlie interrupted to ask about soft spots . " Hell , yes , " said Walter darkly . " A couple of the biggest developments have run into trouble . Bad planning . Not selling . Not enough capital  --  you remember that place near Washington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thatcher decided that he wanted less theory and more detail . He asked about Northern Land Development and Fiord Haven . Saddened , Walter shook his head . " Never heard of it . " Neither had Charlie . But , of course , he knew someone who would have . Even more predictably , that someone was a Miss Hazen and she was free for lunch . " I can break my appointment with Berman and join you , " Charlie said . Was this the offer of an official escort ? Thatcher could not be sure . In any event , he said , " I think I can handle Miss Hazen on my own , Charlie . Thank you , anyway . " In a matter of minutes , he was discovering that he had done Charlie a serious injustice . Miss Hazen was waiting for him at the bar of the Pierre . She was smoking a slim black cigar .  | Thigh-high boots reached thigh-low pearls ; green-rimmed sweep-around sunglasses echoed a brief emerald shift . On the stool beside her , she had deposited a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thatcher , another new experience . " Miss Hazen ? " he inquired blandly . It was . Miss Hazen , associated with Fontana , Goldsmith &; Hazen , did not waste time on preliminary niceties . Thatcher was barely seated before she was proving that she had done her homework . In brisk , staccato phrases , interrupted only by four martinis , she gave a real estate specialist 's view of Fiord Haven . And once they reached their table , she plunged on . " Now , what is it you want to know ? " In spite of conspicuous appurtenances of femininity , Miss Hazen favored a distinctly man-to-man approach . Thatcher tried to prove worthy of it . " About some of the financial details ? " he began . " Right ! " said Miss Hazen , thrusting the menu at a waiter like a rapier . " You know that Quinlan and Valenti incorporated , do n't you ? " " Yes ? " " But that 's a technicality , " Miss Hazen went on , rummaging through a large purse for another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the public , so we do n't have the real dirt on them ? " Although he was in danger of being mesmerized , Thatcher knew she meant that Fontana , Goldsmith &; Hazen did not have the information about capital and earnings they automatically filed on any corporation selling stock to the public . Miss Hazen was disposing of an oyster . Thatcher seized his opportunity . " How did they raise the money for Fiord Haven ? " he asked . It was an investment that must have run to several hundred thousand dollars . And Fiord Haven 's many promotions were not cheap . Eddie Quinlan and Ralph had not seemed like rich men  --  and Thatcher 's eye for this was acute .  | Miss Hazen 's back-up glasses were hexagonal and studded with small pieces of reflecting metal . They were , if anything , more opaque than the first pair . " Passed the hat , " she said . " Friends and relatives  --  that sort of thing . Valenti 's father-in-law is a dentist  --  and you know what that means . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not altogether sure he accepted Miss Hazen 's certainty on the point . " Anyway , they parlayed it with those apartments in Boston . Then they sank everything into the New Hampshire deal . " " And they have enough capital ? " Thatcher asked . Miss Hazen was offhand . " None of these vacation-home babies ever have enough capital . Everything they do eats up money . So it all boils down to the big question  --  are they selling lots ? If they are  --  they 're in gravy . If not , they 're in big , big trouble . Feast or famine  --  that 's about it . " " And since Fiord Haven is not a publicly held corporation , we have no information about their sales ? " Thatcher suggested . Sylvia Hazen weighed his comment . " Right . You 've got it in one . But there is something we 've heard in their favor . When they bought the property , they took an option on another four hundred acres  --  in case they want to expand . That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from hitting the wall the way a lot of the other boys have . " " You know , " Thatcher said , " the frenzy of their selling efforts suggested to me that they might be in difficulties . " Only after the words were out of his mouth did he realize that he might have been tactless . Miss Hazen , and by extension , Fontana , Goldsmith &; Hazen , obviously were not above forceful techniques . But in this instance , the lady identified with tradition . She abandoned the prosciutto . " That 's how it grabs a lot of people , " she told him kindly . " But they all operate as if there was no tomorrow . I just came back from an operation in Puerto Rico that charters jet planes from Cleveland and Chicago , and takes hundreds of pros-  | pects out to this thing called Paradise Island . And Ed and Larry Fish out in Nevada offer you a weekend in Las Vegas , complete with stake . They 've got about five thousand acres of desert to peddle . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another cigar . Thatcher was thanking her for her cooperation when she suddenly dropped her businesslike manner . She removed her glasses to reveal wide-spaced green eyes . " Yes , yes , I 'll keep an eye peeled for whatever turns up about Fiord Haven , " she said . " Of course , this murder business wo n't help . . . " Thatcher 's look of inquiry drew forth information . " The Daily News , " said Miss Hazen . " In this business , you 've got to watch them like hawks . Well , anything that passes my desk , I 'll shoot over . " " Thank you , " said Thatcher . " And Mr. Thatcher , " Miss Hazen added when they were ready to part at her Vespa . " Tell Charlie I 'll keep in touch , wo n't you ? " Thatcher denied himself this pleasure . Who was he to chaff Charlie on unorthodox methods ? Instead , he consulted another member of the Sloan . Answell Briggs , of the real estate department , had no Sylvia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said boyishly , " I thought you were on vacation . " With asperity , Thatcher explained his pro-tern status to the phone . He then repeated his request for information . " Oh sure , " said Briggs . " James Joel Finley . He 's one of the big names in architecture these days , you know . " " It 's not a field I keep up with , " Thatcher admitted . " Lucky devil , " said Briggs . " Finley 's had a lot of publicity about some library he built in Hawaii  --  a big play in Time . You know the sort of thing . But he has n't designed any buildings here in New York . " " So at the moment , he 's more famous than rich ? " " Put it this way , " Briggs explained . " He can make it big ,  | but he has n't so far . Is that the sort of thing you want to know ? " " In part , " said Thatcher . He went on to explain James @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comment . " We-ell , " said Briggs , " it could be almost anything . They could be giving him a straight fee for designing this lodge , and maybe one or two model homes . " " What are the other possibilities ? " Thatcher asked . Briggs thought for a moment . " He could be profit sharing , John . But to tell you the truth , 1 'd bet that they 've worked out some deal where Finley lets them use his name and farms out the work to somebody else . That way he gets the publicity he wants , and it does n't cost them so much . " Here was another line of inquiry to hand Henry , if he needed one , thought Thatcher . Aloud he said : " Tell me , Answell , just how good an architect is James Joel Finley ? " " Good ? " the phone repeated . " John , I can see you do n't keep up with the field . If , by good , you mean inventive or even proficient , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in architecture are comparable  --  oh , say , to dress designers . It 's all a matter of line and looks . You make a name by designing an all glass house , or a house that 's built under a highway . Or a house that revolves He had , Thatcher saw , struck a vein . " Yes , yes , " he said . " But tell me , Answell , what makes it safe for us to go into the buildings these distinguished architects design ? " " In many cases , " said Briggs firmly , " it is not safe . But if it is , it 's because of some engineer  --  possibly an engineer employed by the Sloan . Or by the labor unions . . . " This alliance lost Thatcher . " Nobody else may give a damn , " Answell explained , " but the people who put up the money  --  like us . And the construction gangs are interested , too . When they see something  | that 's likely to collapse on them  --  well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two of us , we introduce some elementary safety . " There is such a thing , thought Thatcher , as too cold a critical eye . Answell , he knew , had been involved in financing some of the more extraordinary edifices now disfiguring Manhattan . Perhaps he was constantly frustrated by the triumph of profit motives over loftier values . But suddenly Thatcher was reminded of James Joel Finley  --  and Alec Prohack . What is true in Manhattan may well hold true elsewhere . Another point to keep Henry busy . Or , as Henry put it , more loose ends . As if there were not enough already . Thatcher being as much of a perfectionist in his way as Henry Morland , he persevered . His last query required only one brief telephone call . An hour later Miss Corsa , who had taken down the telephoned reply , deposited the findings on Thatcher 's desk . " Thank you , Miss Corsa , " he murmured . " Not at all , Mr. Thatcher , " said Miss Corsa , eyes averted . He understood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Thatcher was still away . Amused , Thatcher stuffed the report into his briefcase , to be studied in other surroundings . But not before he absorbed its gist . The credit rating of almost everybody connected with Fiord Haven and the two murders was excellent , from Stephen Lester to Eunice , from Eunice 's fiance , Peter Vernon , to Eddie Quinlan and Ralph Valenti . Even Alan and Sukey Davidson were no threat to a potential extender of credit . There was only one man whose personal financial position was precarious enough to merit warnings to the world at large . That was the distinguished architect , James Joel Finley.  | WHEN THATCHER returned to Boston late that evening , it was to discover a downcast Henry awaiting him . " The police were n't really interested in what I had to say , " he announced self-pityingly . " For your sake , Henry , I wish you were on death row , " Thatcher replied . " It 's only because of Ruth that I ca n't really sympathize . " Henry was impervious to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , nobody 's making any progress at all . " The pile of newspapers at his feet bore him out . Thatcher glanced idly over them . The police were withholding comment . The principals were in seclusion . Inquiries were proceeding . " Although why you expected to learn anything from the Christian Science Monitor eludes me , " Thatcher commented . Absently , Henry replied that he had just ordered all available papers . Mary Baker Eddy , complete with a Polish editorial , had been scooped up in the newsie 's net . Thatcher was relieved to discover that the strain had not caused Henry to forget everything he ever knew . " I tell you , John , " he said , waking from a brown study , " I do n't have a lot of confidence in the Boston police . I do n't think they 'll ever find out who killed Valenti . " Thatcher resisted the temptation to point out that New Hampshire was not making stunning progress in the matter of Stephen Lester . He realized that these words really meant that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 153  | implausible hypotheses . And on balance , he preferred not to contemplate what they might have been . " Tell me , " he said instead . " Did anything ever come to light about that invitation list ? " " What ? Oh , you mean getting Eunice and Amanda Lester to the Pru ? No . Everybody 's sticking to their story . Including Finley , who denies everything . " " How do you know , Henry ? " asked Thatcher , beginning to see light at the end of the tunnel . Henry was restrained . " After I finished with the police ? and let me tell you John , I could put my opinion of them in much stronger terms  --  I naturally made a few calls . " " Oh naturally , " said Thatcher , to whom all was now clear . Henry had gone haring out of the police station full of frisk and eager to pursue his own investigation . He had been surprised , and possibly hurt , to discover that not everybody shared his innocent taste for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was intruding . " I think , John , " said Henry , confirming this reading in every wounded syllable , " I think now is the time for us to go home . " Home was not what it had been . " Well , so here you are . Fresh from another murder , " said Ruth Morland with a noticeable lack of enthusiasm . Thatcher was fond of his hostess , but not fond enough to let this pass . " You recall , Ruth , " he replied coldly , " whose idea this trip to Boston was . I think we all agree it was not an unqualified success . " " Oh , I do n't know about that , " Henry intervened . " After all , we did find out there 's nothing sinister in Lester 's background . He was just another one of those loudmouths , full of his own moral superiority . " Henry 's jauntiness had revived the minute he set foot over  | his own threshold , where he was monarch of all he surveyed , including 3.6 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " There have been quite a few phone calls this morning , " she went on implacably . " The State Police want to see both of you again . And a Miss Corsa called , from the Sloan . " Thatcher felt a momentary qualm . Was this what had ruffled the usually placid Ruth ? " What did she want ? " he asked cautiously . " She was just making sure she could keep in contact with you . She seems to be a very sensible young woman , " said Ruth , like Queen Victoria bestowing tempered praise on a sister sovereign . Henry had no difficulty hacking his way to the nub of the problem . " I suppose Duncan has been on your neck . " Ruth 's voice was hollow . " He wants to come up for the weekend . Bringing a lawyer with him . " " All right , " Henry barked , suddenly going on the offensive . " Tell him , it 'll be a great help having him here for a couple of days . Say the Trail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been able to get round to it . That 'll fix his wagon , " he chucked at high glee . " And when do the police want to see us ? " " At one-thirty . Oh , dear , " she sighed in uncharacteristic despair , " I suppose you have to go . " Henry stared at her . " Of course , we 've got to go . Anyway , why should n't we ? " " Because , " his wife said with returning tartness , " on the basis of past performance , the minute you step inside the station the desk sergeant will slump forward , riddled with machine-gun bullets . " The desk sergeant did no such thing . The personnel of the station remained in robust good health throughout their visit . What 's more , the general air of camaraderie and the casual treatment of their formal affidavits suggested that  | Henry 's status had dwindled to that of a potential prosecution witness . A very minor witness . " The Boston police seem to think they 'll be ready for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the genial parting . " Guess they want to show us hicks how you do things . " Henry 's excitement bubbled over as they returned to their car . " They must be planning an arrest on the basis of Lester 's murder , " he speculated , prepared to revise his opinion of Boston officials . " Yes . " Thatcher , too , had noticed that their affidavits covered the discovery of Lester 's body and only one other point . " All they wanted from me was testimony to the effect that Finley was prominent in the cocktail lounge the evening of the murder . " " It 's easy enough to see what they 're heading for . Finley killed Lester , then Finley rushed back to give himself an alibi . You and Ralph Valenti both talked about something like that when we could n't figure out why the murderer did n't simply tip Lester 's corpse off a cliff somewhere . " Thatcher nodded slowly as he recalled earlier conversations . " The official theory must be that Finley intended to go back after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discovery of the body . " " Fine . But what difference does it make what Finley intended to do and then did n't ? " Henry bounced impatiently in his seat as they waited out the town 's only red light . " What I want to know , is why he did it . Why bash Lester in the first place ? " " For that matter , " said Thatcher , falling prey to a habit of orderly thought , " why then go on to stab Valenti ? The police are n't thinking in terms of two different murderers . " Henry 's eyes were gleaming . " I 'll tell you what . We could stop by at Fiord Haven . Ruth said Alec Prohack has finally got his crew back on the job . They 'll know all the dirt . " Thatcher agreed at once . Experience had taught him that it was useless to deny Henry his excitements . One should remain  | by his side , eyewitness to his non-homicidal conduct , and let the bodies fall where they might . Meanwhile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that fight between Lester and Finley about a roof is our motive , then Alec is bound to be one of the prosecution 's star witnesses . A lot would depend on how he saw things . That kind of fight , whatever it was about , can cover anything from a mild difference of opinion to a murderous rage . " Whether Henry 's reading of the situation was right or wrong , it became apparent , as soon as they pulled into the construction lot , that it was shared by at least one other person . The police had already had their innings with Alec Prohack . Now James Joel Finley was having his . The architect and the builder were standing apart from the activity swirling around the unfinished lodge . Neither of them acknowledged the arrival of the Morland car . " I 've got to tell it the way it happened , Mr. Finley , " Prohack was saying . " You know that . " Finley no longer looked like the great man of modern architecture . When he had been riding high , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immense assurance had made him seem an exceptionally vigorious sixty . Curiously enough , his troubles had taken years off his apparent age , but not for the better . Now he looked a bewildered and ineffective fifty . His clothes hung limply from his shoulders as if they were a size too large . He was having difficulty with his voice . " I 'm not asking you to do anything else , Prohack . I just want to make sure you keep things in proportion . " Prohack 's eyes focused on some distant horizon . " I would n't know about that . They asked me if you had a fight with Lester . You did , and I told them so . " " I 've already admitted I had words with him . " Finley ground the sentence out . " That does n't make it a fight , not in their sense . Every architect has trouble with clients at some stage of the game . " " I guess that 's right . So there 's nothing to worry about . " Pro-  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men had swarmed onto the roof . " If that 's all , I could go check ? " " No , it is n't ! " Finley tried for a more placatory tone . " For God 's sake , man , you 're a contractor . You 've been around building sites all your life . How many times have you known an architect to murder someone who did n't approve of what he was building ? " " Well , if you put it like that  --  never , " Prohack conceded . " But that is n't what the cops are asking me . " " You know what cops are like . They 'll make a mountain out of any molehill . " Finley brandished the roll of drawings he was clutching . " After all , what is there to say ? Lester and I had a difference of professional opinion , that 's all . Anyway , I was being professional . God knows what he thought he was being . " " Look , Mr. Finley . I 'm not out to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too . You know that is n't good enough for the cops . They want to know everything that happened , everything that was said . And that 's what they 're getting . What else can I do ? " Finley 's hand crushed the drawings into an hourglass . " You can make it plain to them that Lester was simply another nut ! " " You ca n't very well expect me to do that . " The builder looked at the architect with open dislike . " I told you that roof was n't safe long before Lester did . You know we were right . That 's why you 're changing it . " Finley slid away from the subject of the roof . " All right , so you told me . You 're still alive , are n't you ? " " Maybe , " Prohack suggested softly , " that 's because I did n't threaten to make it public . I did n't say I was going to write to the Architectural Society . I did n't threaten to make a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could have gotten to first base , " Finley blustered . " That was n't the way you reacted then , " Prohack reminded him sharply . " Sure , you were high and mighty with him at  | first . Just like you were with me . But you changed your tune damned fast when you saw what you were tangled with . " Finley made a last despairing effort to salvage the situation . " I 've admitted I was annoyed with him . " " Who do you think you 're kidding ? You were seeing red ! " " My God ! " Finley howled . " The man was out to destroy me . For no reason at all ! " " So tell that to the cops and see how they like it ! " But James Joel Finley , white-faced and shaken , refused the challenge . " You ca n't tell them that , " he protested . " I do n't have to . You 're telling the whole world . " For the first time , Finley became aware of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its passengers . Then , without another word , he shambled off . Henry 's whistle was the first sound to break the silence . It occurred to Thatcher that the sight of Henry , chin on hand and agog with curiosity , must have been the final blow for Finley . " Well , now , " Henry chirped , " that sounded interesting . " " That smug bastard has had it coming to him for a long time , " Alec Prohack stated roundly . Henry showed no disposition to quarrel with this assessment . " What was wrong with the roof ? " Prohack was relieving his feelings by savagely jabbing tobacco into a stumpy pipe . " It was one of those flat roofs that are the big thing in California . You know , Finley has done most of his work out on the Coast . I did n't like it when they handed out the specifications , and I told him so . I kept telling him so after I got the job , too . " " Why ? " asked Thatcher , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Your only responsibility is to build according to the specifications , is n't it ? If they 're wrong , that 's not your fault . " Prohack replied that it did n't do a builder any good to become identified with roofs that fell in , accompanied by extensive property damage and personal injury .  | " Yes , yes , I can see that , " Thatcher agreed . " But was Finley 's roof that bad ? " " Hell , I do n't know . I have n't had a lot of experience with these flat roofs . He was using steel beams , and he said that would be good enough . I still was n't crazy about the idea . Of course , his big pitch was that the money for the lodge had been allocated . So Quinlan and Valenti were n't going to be sweet about spending more than they 'd bargained for . " Prohack puffed vigorously to induce a kindle before continuing in an aside , " If you ask me , they were n't in any shape to ante up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room in their budgets for last-minute changes . " " You 're dreaming of another world , Alec , " Henry replied to this piece of Yankee conservatism . " Everybody builds before they 've got enough money these days . " Thatcher regarded his companions without favor . They were both making substantial livings out of modern America 's haste to acquire possessions . How much would either of them relish a world in which young couples did not buy a home until they had the entire cost in their savings account ? Or , for that matter , a world where you did not open The Pepper Mill until you were above the need to finance ? " Let 's agree that nobody is financially prudent these days , " he said sternly , " and get back to this roof . Did Lester know any more than you did ? Or was he making idle accusa-tions ? " " That 's the whole point . " Prohack removed his pipe to underline the seriousness of his observations . " You know they had a big winter two years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buildings in the new shopping centers could n't stand up . When this guy Lester went to build himself a house last year , he wanted a flat roof like he had in California . He made such a pest of himself , his architect gave him a short course in roof framing . Explained to him why those flat roofs had collapsed under the snow load , even with steel beams . And finally , of course , made him see reason . The beams would have to be centered so much closer than in California that it would  | push the price way up . So , Lester had all the facts at his fingertips . He knew that Finley was planning exactly the same kind of framing that had n't stood up two years ago . " " Finley must have loved that , " Henry remarked ironically . Surprisingly , Prohack dissented . Possibly he was now sorry he had goaded Finley . " You may have gotten the wrong idea about Finley , seeing him go to pieces just now . He was n't bad with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the great man stunt . That 's his style . But he was listening , I 'll say that for him . In fact , I was kind of pleased . I thought maybe Lester was going to manage what I had n't . But then Lester pulled that business about making the whole thing public . " Henry was the keen-eyed detective . " You mean they struck sparks off each other ? Natural incompatibles ? " " No , " Prohack insisted , " that is n't what I mean . This Lester was n't mad . He just said it was a matter of duty . The public had a right to be informed about incompetence that was creating safety hazards . He made a little speech , sort of congratulating himself . You know what I mean . He said the main trouble with our society was the let-George-do-it attitude . If more people acted like him , then we 'd have a better society . No incompetence , no indifference , no crime in the streets . Does n't seem to have worked out that way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own particular street . " It 's astonishing Lester survived as long as he did , " Thatcher observed . " You remember what Eunice said about him , " Henry said darkly . " I do n't know about this Eunice , but Finley was ready to split a gut . You ca n't really blame the old geezer either . One minute he 's condescending to some stranger . Hell , Lester had n't even bought a lot . The next thing Finley knows , he 's going to be flayed alive in public . " " How did this exchange end ? " Thatcher inquired . " We heard you say Finley saw red . " " If you ask me , he was looking for a way to back down . He  | was sure-as-hell willing to go over Lester 's numbers . But Lester just strolled away , as if he could n't wait to get to a typewriter and start telling the world . That 's when Finley exploded . I do n't know what happened next . I was the nearest target and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to himself , as if only his sagacity had saved his life . " But when did this happen ? " Thatcher asked sharply . " You said Lester had n't bought a lot yet . So it was n't Saturday afternoon . " " That 's right . All this happened during the morning tour . The rest of the crowd was over on the hillside looking at where the ski tow is going to be . " Alec Prohack brightened into his first display of enthusiasm . " Over there . The trails are supposed to start right at the crest . And , of course , the lake is on the other side . Makes a tidy amount of work for us . " Henry refused to be diverted into construction details . " But Alec , " he said , disappointed , " then Lester was n't murdered for seven or eight hours . " Prohack did his best . " The police are thinking that maybe Lester and Finley met at the site before dinner and Finley made an effort to get Lester to see reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Finley 's picking up a hammer and letting fly out of sheer . . . sheer . . . " Exasperation , " Henry supplied . " Eunice really had a point , did n't she ? " Thatcher was not so swift to draw obvious conclusions . " Whether she did , depends on what Finley was doing before he showed up for cocktails at the motel . Does anybody know ? Or does he simply say he was alone somewhere ? " A grim smile appeared on Alec Prohack 's roughhewn features . " It 's neater than that . The police asked him just that question on Wednesday afternoon . He told them he was with Ralph Valenti . Then , when the police were through with him , he went down to Boston to have a talk with the developers and attend that big dinner of theirs . That night somebody takes a knife and shuts Valenti 's mouth for good . "  | OTHERS MIGHT marvel at the tragic vulnerability of a renowned architect and the macabre annihilation of his alibi . But not John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but destroyed Thatcher 's capacity for surpise . This , he knew , tended to set him apart from his fellowmen . On Wall Street , for instance , he was surrounded by colleagues who were stunned and shocked with monotonous regularity by a sag in IBM , by a rise in the interest rate , by a presidential address , or even by antitrust suits launched with elephantine secrecy by the Department of Justice . In many ways , the telephone in his office on the sixth floor of the Sloan Guaranty Trust was a conduit for pained yelps : " My God , John ! Have you seen the latest ? " " You wo n't believe it , but ? " " I tell you , I thought I was seeing things ! " Wall Street is , at bottom , a collection of endearingly childlike innocents , always expecting the good , the beautiful , the true , and the profitable . The shrewd eyes , manly handshakes , and expensive tailoring that deluded the public ( and a goodly portion of the financial press ) did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the few men on the Street not constantly surprised by the turn of events  --  any turn of events . This immunity was the by-product of other rarities : an observing eye and a long memory . Thatcher was not the oldest financier in New York but , he was willing to bet , he was one 163  | of the few who remembered some of the more lunatic moments of the Great Crash . Of course , he did not expect a mass defenestration of fund managers . Far from it . But , if it came , he would not be rendered speechless with shock and wonder . Similarly , he had seen great firms go bankrupt and large banks collapse . He had seen excellent lawyers become alcoholics , Secretaries of State , and worse . He had known dowagers who had eloped with youthful chauffeurs . So , while he was frequently interested and curious , he rarely found himself overwhelmingly surprised . Yet that was exactly his state of mind in Pepperton , New Hampshire on the morning after Alec Prohack 's disclosures . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They were sitting in the kitchen over an ample breakfast . And , indisputably , Ruth was angry . Not resigned . Not amused . Not even humorously indignant . No , Ruth was mad as hell . Considering , Thatcher thought , what he had seen Ruth endure  --  and this included backpacking in the Rockies with three small children , two summers during which Henry experimented with wild nuts and berries as a source of food , and one winter , many years ago , when Henry had been smitten by the charms of the coach of the U.S. Ladies ' Field Hockey Team  --  the cause seemed , to a mere man , disproportionate to the effect . Nevertheless , the effect was enough to make him wish himself elsewhere . " You said what ? " said Ruth , coffeepot ominously suspended in midair . Henry , Thatcher regretted to see , did not recognize storm signals when they were flapping in a high wind . " I said to come on up . We could put them up for a few days . " Henry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for more toast . " Seems there 's some fuss about that Porsche of Steve Lester 's . So Eunice has to clear it up . And I 'm glad to say that this Willy of hers ? " " Peter , " Thatcher supplied , a wary eye on Ruth . " Peter Vernon . "  | " That 's right , " Henry rattled on . " Well , Peter Vernon 's finally decided to lend a hand ? " " Henry Morland ! " said Ruth . She was quiet . But she got through . " Do you mean to tell me that you 've invited two house guests , at a time like this ? " God knew , Henry had never been a pourer of oil on troubled waters . But Thatcher had not realized that he was fool enough to try answering such a question . " What do you mean by a time like this , Ruth ? After all , everything 's just about wrapped up . I expect the police will be arresting that nut , James Joel Finley , any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say . No , Ruth , all that trouble is just about over now . And , of course , Eunice does n't care to stay at the White Mountains Motel . You can understand that , after what happened . So , I said we 'd be delighted to put them up . Probably it will just be overnight . " Ruth looked steadily at her husband . Then , without a word , she put down the coffeepot and walked out of the kitchen . Despite a brilliantly clear autumn afternoon , the atmosphere was not happy . " I do n't understand it , " said Henry crossly when the two men were preparing scratch lunches some hours later . " Ruth 's taken the car and gone someplace . Now , why on earth . . . ? " Thatcher had no desire to intervene in marital discord . He did , however , suggest that the lady of the house might feel she had a right to warning , if not veto power , over forthcoming houseguests . Particularly when the link with those houseguests remained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , recalling his descent with six stranded members of the Dartmouth Outing Club and his unannounced arrival with a visiting delegation of Englishmen . He described Ruth 's splendid and unstinting acceptance of these challenges . " Ruth , " said Henry with simple assurance , " loves company . " Thatcher had once known a man , a staid investment banker , who felt a periodic need to seek out some deserted location , throw back his head and scream as loudly as possible . He  | would then wend his way back to civilization and function as impeccably as usual . Nor did this need for catharsis in any way disable him ; it grew no more pressing with age or tension . Simply , and to the end , Brooks Sargent had to scream aloud every two or three months . Life with Henry , Thatcher reflected , might induce similar needs . It was not a train of thought he proposed to discuss with Henry . " Exactly why is Eunice Lester coming up , did you say ? " he asked as Henry peered helplessly into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I guess . What ? Oh , it seems that the police hauled off that Porsche of Lester 's . And , now that this question of Lester 's estate has come up , Eunice decided that it would be wise to get up here and attach it . Her Boston lawyer got in touch with Guy Villars . " Thatcher wondered if this attention to relatively minor detail was in fact the result of Boston legal advice . Possibly it was the fiance , until now conspicuous by his absence , who had remembered the expensive car still in New Hampshire . Henry was now a man cast adrift by the woman who had vowed to love , cherish and feed him . " I ca n't find any pickles , " he said plaintively . Thatcher silently removed three jars of pickles . " Henry , has it occurred to you that this Vernon fellow is something of a dark horse ? You know , he may explain some of Eunice Lester 's tension . Granted , she has been in a difficult position . . . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But not as difficult as . . . say , Finley , " Thatcher continued . Henry , who had succeeded in laying as unappetizing a luncheon as possible in Ruth 's kitchen , protested , " But Eunice did n't murder anybody ! "  | Thatcher let that pass , noting however that Henry had weighed the evidence against Finley , and found it sufficient . And was it ? Henry was still waiting . " I agree , " Thatcher said slowly , " but since Mrs. Lester did not murder anybody , she seems to have been unnecessarily . . . er . . . apprehensive . " " She was a suspect , " Henry corrected him . " I wish Ruth would remember to stock rye bread . " The afternoon seemed interminable . Henry dithered around but showed no inclination for forays to Gridleigh , to Fiord Haven , to Boston , or even to his own office not two miles away . Amused , Thatcher understood . Henry was a gadfly who needed a secure base of operations . And with Ruth gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . How many miles on the Appalachian Trail had been traversed only because Ruth was securely placed in the Pepperton kitchen ? She reappeared at four-thirty , serene as usual . She also had several large paper bags . " Well , Henry , " she replied to a fusillade of questions , " if we 're having houseguests , we have to feed them , do n't we ? " " Oh , good , " said Henry , inspecting the contents of one of the bags he had transported from the car . " I 'm glad they had pumpkin ice cream . " Did Henry ever suspect that occasional need to scream ? Thatcher doubted it . By the time a large Cadillac was nosing into the Morland driveway , peace and harmony reigned within . Already , appetizing aromas were beginning to fill the kitchen ; upstairs , flowers had been placed in the bedrooms , the bathrooms held full complements of fluffy towels . Henry , spruce in a sports jacket and respectable slacks , was readying an extensive array of bottles . Eunice Lester , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and charmingly apologetic to Ruth Morland .  | " I do realize that we 're imposing on you , " she began . But Ruth , looking trim in a skirt and blouse , did not let her finish . " Not a bit of it , " she said with warmth . " We 're delighted . " And , Thatcher saw , Ruth meant it . If there were any surprises left in life , it was a sure thing that women would provide them . Men , or at least , Peter Vernon , most assuredly would not . He proved to be a solid , middle-aged man without much to say . Or so it first seemed . Over cocktails , or the fearsome concoctions Henry regarded as cocktails , he responded readily enough to questions and even joined the general conversation . But he was reserved , almost self-conscious . This was not altogether surprising , thought Thatcher . Within minutes , Henry , Ruth and Eunice might have been lifelong friends , so unconstrainedly were they exchanging views on current events . Not everybody has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the houseguest of total strangers is not conducive to ease and relaxation in most adults . Furthermore . only very young men can carry off the role of fiance with any real aplomb . " Wholesale liquor importer , " Vernon replied to one of Henry 's direct questions . " You should drop in on us when you 're in Boston . We have one of the finest cellars on the East Coast . " " I can hardly believe it . " Eunice was saying as Henry lavishly poured refills . " Although I know that Steven could make himself obnoxious about almost anything , including architects ' plans . Still . . . " Peter Vernon cleared his throat . " I do n't know much about the details , " he announced , unnecessarily to Thatcher 's way of thinking , " but a mistake like that is important . is n't it ? A defective roof . That 's dangerous . An architect might kill anybody who found out . " Ruth Morland , reappearing from the kitchen with a second tray of cheese savories from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Finley would be grateful . Surely it would be worse  | for his reputation if the mistake were n't found . Then the lodge might have collapsed and killed people . This way , he had the error corrected before the building was up . That could n't hurt his reputation . After all , how many people would learn about it ? " It was Henry who responded . " More people know about it than you might think , Ruth , " he said . " All the local people , like Alec . Actually , I expect half of Gridleigh knows all about the mistake the great architect made . Then , too , there were Quinlan and Valenti . And they were paying Finley . . . " Ruth looked unconvinced and Ruth was a woman of admirable common sense . How important would this have been to James Joel Finley , who was building a national , not a New Hampshire reputation ? Thatcher wondered . Again Vernon , almost hesitatingly , commented . " That 's true , of course . But then you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best of both worlds . Without . . . er . . . without Lester around , he could quietly alter his plans . Then no one would ever know he had even made an error in his plans  --  let alone that he designed a building that was dangerous . This might be enough to cause him to commit murder . " The fireplace was casting flickering shadows through the living room . Outside , the suddenly quickening dusk promised that summer was passing and the long New England winter was just around the corner . " That suggests a pathological ego , " Ruth remarked . " To commit murder for such a reason , and then a second murder to cover it . " " God knows the man was an egotist , " said Henry . But James Joel Finley 's vanity , it had seemed to Thatcher , was far from pathological . It seemed soundly based in dollars and cents . All his affectations were calculated to pay off . " Of course , I did n't know Finley , " Vernon remarked almost apologetically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what  | had happened at Fiord Haven , these withdrawals from small points carefully made , added up to the portrait of a cautious man . Perhaps too cautious . Suddenly , after a long silence , Eunice burst forth : " Oh , that does n't make any sense  --  not about James Joel Finley , at any rate . That was n't why it happened . I know it was n't . What happened was that Steve was so offensive , he was so goddam superior . . . " " Eunice , " said Peter . She ignored him . " This poor fish lost his head and swatted Steve . And I understand it . Oh , God , how I understand it . " " Eunice , " said Vernon once again . Ruth was more effective . " I think , " she said rising , " dinner should be about ready . Just bring your drinks to the table . " By general consent , the subject of murder was dropped for the rest of the evening . Naturally , this involved deflecting Henry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constraint to display insatiable curiosity about the Appalachian Trail . How had it been established ? What about the right of way ? Who used it ? He had so many questions that Henry could barely keep up . On the whole , dinner featured Peter Vernon , talking steadily . Was this because he felt that Eunice Lester 's feelings about her late husband were too intense for prudence ? Whether or not someone else had murdered him ? Possibly . It was possible , Thatcher decided , that Peter Vernon was simply conventional to an unnatural degree . At any rate the evening passed pleasantly if unexcitingly . The ladies retired early leaving the gentlemen to nightcaps at an hour suggesting that no one had a burning desire to prolong the occasion . " Vernon , " said Thatcher , suppressing a yawn , " do you know anything about Eddie Quinlan or Ralph Valenti ? " Vernon was , after all , a Boston businessman . " I wish I had never heard of them , " he replied with the first hint of real feeling Thatcher had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this ? " he broke off . When he continued , it was more temperately . " When Eunice and I decided we might be wanting a vacation place , I thought of building one of our own . But I do n't know if you know about the labor situation here in New Hampshire . . . " For five minutes , he gave them a description . It was accurate , detailed and dull . Henry put another log on the fire with unnecessary violence . " . . . so , " Vernon continued . " I looked into the better developments . Some of them are pretty cheap operations , you know . " " Yes , " said Thatcher , recalling Miss Hazen 's lecture back in New York . " Quinlan and Valenti are newcomers , " Vernon said . " But they did build those garden apartments on the Jamaicaway , and I happen to know they 've been a success . I asked around , and people who should know assured me they were bright , young and ambitious  --  but they did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I know their advertising made them sound like some of these fly-by-night deals , but people who dealt with them in Boston , and that includes their general contractor , told me that they really did hold out for the best . " Something stirred in Thatcher 's mind , something beyond the sudden realization that there was more to Peter Vernon than met the eye . Eddie Quinlan , and the late Ralph Valenti , prided themselves on their imaginative selection of prospects . They thought they had enticed Peter Vernon . Instead , coolly and after some effort , Peter Vernon had singled them out . As , perhaps , Stephen Lester had ? " Well , " Vernon wound up . " It was n't one of my brighter ideas . Not that I could have foreseen exactly how bad it would turn out to be . I hope to God that , when this business gets cleared up , Eunice and I never have to see New Hampshire again . Hell , if we need a vacation house , we can get one in Vermont . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "  | It was a measure of Henry 's apathy that he uttered no protest . The next morning , it appeared that the opportunity to leave New Hampshire forever might be at hand . " That was Mr. Villars , " Eunice announced returning from the phone . She looked radiantly happy . " He says I have to go down to the state police with him and sign some papers . Then we can leave " Oh , ca n't you stay for another day or two ? " Ruth protested . Eunice smiled affectionately at her . " We 'd love to , Ruth . You and Henry have been just wonderful . But  --  you understand . " Ruth understood . Thatcher understood . Peter Vernon understood . Everybody understood . Everybody , that is , except Henry . Henry had fallen deep into thought . And Thatcher knew why . The warhorse , dormant for fully twenty-four hours , had just heard the bugle . And Thatcher knew exactly what had sounded the alarm : the words State Police . Ruth did too . " Before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an eloquent look , " let me get you all another cup of coffee . " " Fine , " said Henry alertly . " And do n't worry , Ruth , I 'll be back soon . "  | " So THIS is where you like to spend all your time , " Ruth Morland observed , her disenchanted gaze inspecting the State Police Barracks . Curiously enough , it was not Henry 's burning desire to play detective or Eunice Lester 's need for additional support which had propelled the entire house party thirty miles down the road . Ruth Morland and John Thatcher had fallen afoul of Peter Vernon 's determination to repay hospitality with hospitality . " Look , you said you had errands in Gridleigh this morning anyway , " he had urged . " And Guy Villars says it will only take a minute to sign the papers . Then we could all have lunch together before Eunice and I head back to Boston . " The result was inevitable . Thatcher and the Morlands were cooling their heels in the reception room , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the State Police garage . The desk sergeant greeted Henry like a long lost friend while Ruth looked on ironically . Unabashed , Henry exploited the intimacy . " At the gas station they were saying you 'd pulled in Finley , " he prompted eagerly . " Talk about tom-toms ! They 've got nothing on the grapevine around here . All you 've got to do is sneeze in one county , and everybody in the next county is ready to lend you a handkerchief , " the sergeant said . " That 's right . We picked him up last night . "  | " Then you 're building your case on the basis of Lester 's murder , not Valenti 's ? " Henry pursued . The sergeant became heavily sarcastic . " Oh , there 's no talk about a murder charge . Finley was booked as a material witness . Not that we can get away with that for long . The big shot from Fiord Haven is already down here  --  you know , the one who 's a lawyer in Boston  --  so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ VIPs decide to go ahead with a murder charge . " Henry sighed happily . This was life ! " And will they ? " he asked , agog with curiosity . The sergeant shrugged fatalistically . " Who can tell what the brass will ever do ? " Henry was willing to speculate , but Thatcher nudged him sharply as the back door opened to admit Eddie Quinlan with a young couple . The girl recognized them instantly . " Oh , Mr. Thatcher ! And Mr. Morland , too . Do n't you remember me ? Sukey Davidson . " Sukey seemed to be the only member of her party capable of rising to conventional cordiality . Her companions nodded somberly in the background . It was , Thatcher realized , not difficult to assign a cause to Quinlan 's moroseness . The promoter rapidly confirmed this diagnosis . " I suppose you 've heard that they arrested Finley , " he said gloomily . " God knows what this will do to Fiord Haven . " Mentally Thatcher reviewed the blows raining down on that potential Garden of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ murdered . And now the architect arrested . Offhand , he would have said that was more than enough to dissipate the fun-filled image which Eddie Quinlan had spent so much money to fabricate . But he was the first to admit that he did not understand the attraction of Fiord Haven . He decided to eschew the commercial for the personal approach . " How is Finley taking this ? I suppose you 've seen him . " " Oh , sure , I 've seen him . He 's scared as hell . Who can blame him ? " A tight , nervous smile glinted briefly . " I 've got a  | lawyer coming out from Concord . We 'll see how long this charge holds up . Not that it is n't going to do us a lot of damage , no matter what happens . " So much for the personal note . Eddie Quinlan was prepared to discuss lawyers , calculate courtroom probabilities and invite sympathy for his own predicament . But , Thatcher noted , he was not saying one word about James Joel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear Henry galloping into the fray . " I understand what Eddie Quinlan 's doing here , " he was saying brazenly to Alan Davidson . " But what about you two ? I thought you lived in Cambridge ? " " We came up here to have another look at Fiord Haven , " Alan said grudgingly . " There 's a building lot that Alan is interested in , " Sukey said , disassociating herself from her husband . There was a long pause . Alan broke first . " And then Sukey insisted on coming here to the barracks with this damn silly story of hers , " he burst out . Everyone understood there had been a divergence of opinion between the young couple . It 's nature was not so apparent . Sukey had denounced Alan 's objections to cooperation with the establishment . They came poorly , she insisted , from someone infected by a bourgeois propensity for property accumulation . The accusation still rankled . " Silly or not , " she said firmly , " the police have a right to know . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't know this , but on the night of Mr. Lester 's murder , Mr. Valenti changed the entertainment program around . He was n't supposed to speak to us that night . He was n't on the program at all . But at the last minute he announced a change . " " What difference does that make ? " her husband complained . " We did n't even have the program that night . Not after Captain Frewen told everybody about the murder . " Sukey 's lips set in a stubborn line . " Mr. Valenti did n't know the body was going to be discovered . He wanted a lot of wit-  | nesses to what he was doing that night . He probably came to cocktails with blood on his hands ! " " Crap ! " Alan snapped . " That just shows how much you know . First of all , there was n't any blood . Second of all , he would n't have had the time . I 'll prove it to you . Just before we cut out from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their three-bedroom chalet could be cut down to one bedroom . When we went into cocktails he showed me some plans that had been all worked over . The plumbing lines were changed and everything . He would n't have bothered with something like that if he 'd been murdering someone in the meantime . " " And third of all , " Eddie Quinlan cut in , his voice suddenly rasping , " you might remember that Ralph was murdered himself . This is n't just fun and games , you know . I 've spent the last two days with Ralph 's wife . And I 'll tell you this . I 've got my shirt riding on Fiord Haven but , if that Finley bastard stuck a knife into Ralph , I 'll let it all go down the drain  --  to see he gets what 's coming to him ! " There was a painful pause . The Davidsons both flushed darkly . How they would have responded to this outburst remained doubtful , because at that moment the main feature began . The back door once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turning to address a remark to Peter Vernon over her shoulder . Simultaneously Amanda Lester strode in through the front door . She gave one brief look at the gathering , then carefully elevated her chin and advanced on the desk . She was , Thatcher noted apprehensively , swinging a chain of car keys from her finger . " I am Mrs. Stephen Lester , " she announced distinctly . " You told my lawyer you were through with my car . I 've come to pick it up . " The desk sergeant , who could see trouble looming , abandoned the larger philosophical pose and became an anonymous official . " Well , Miss , " he said vaguely , " I 'm afraid there 's going to be some trouble about that . "  | " Mrs. " Amanda was arctic . " What trouble ? " " This Mrs. Lester , " he gestured toward Eunice , " has just attached the car . We ca n't give it to anybody . " Amanda did not let her eyes follow the gesture . As far as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do n't be silly . It 's my car . " The desk sergeant was too cunning to try to argue . " I expect the best thing would be to see your lawyer . It 's a shame you came up here today . You must have just missed the notice . " The facts were slowly sinking in . " Do you mean to tell me that you 're giving my car to her ? " " Maybe you 'd like to talk to Captain Frewen , " the sergeant suggested cravenly . Amanda decided to notice Eunice with a vengeance . " You can tell this bitch that it 's my car . And I mean to have it . " " You 've got it wrong , Amanda . " Eunice was opting for a steely sweetness that brought sweat to the brow of every man in the room . " That car belonged to Steve . Now it belongs to Steve 's estate . " " And that belongs to me . You 've got delusions of grandeur if you think Steve left anything to some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a full octave . " He does n't seem to have done much about leaving things to his tramp of a present wife . " Amanda 's eyes widened . " Who the hell do you think you are ? I 've had just about enough from you . Every time I turn around , there you are trying to get to me . Do n't think I do n't know about your slimy investigators crawling around California . " " And what about your slimy investigators crawling around Boston ? Did you think you were on a one-way street ? Is there something sacred about your dirty little past that nobody 's supposed to ask any questions about it ? " Eunice 's breath was beginning to come quickly . " While you run wild destroying everybody else 's life ? " " Oh , so that bugged you , did it ? " Amanda jeered . " I suppose you 're trying to pass yourself off as some sort of lily maid  | to him . " She waved derisively toward Peter Vernon . " Let me tell you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of woman was bringing up his son . " " And I had every right to find out what he was planning to substitute . " This stung Amanda . " You would n't understand . You 're not capable of it . Steve and I wanted to have a child . We wanted one of our own . When that did n't work out , it was only natural for Steve to want his son . " Eunice laughed bitterly . " What did you and Steve know about wanting a son ? Did you want to change his diapers and nurse him through mumps ? Did you want to toilet train him and teach him how to walk ? You just saw a pretty picture . You wanted a son the way you 'd want a collie dog . " " That 's not true , " Amanda fired up . " You talk as if he 's your exclusive property . He was just as much Steve 's son as he was yours . " " Remember that when he takes his share of Steve 's estate . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He 's not Steve 's son , but he 's Steve 's heir ! " Eunice 's eyes narrowed into slits . " You 're so contemptible , you 're not worth talking to . You and your Steve wanted a son . He did n't want one when it would have done Tommy some good to have a father . He did n't want one so long as it would cost him a cent . He did n't get the urge until he was in the market to buy luxuries . Sure , Tommy 's his heir . It 'll make up for the ten years that went before . " " Tell us about those ten years you spent as a devoted mother , " Amanda gritted through clenched teeth . " The ten years you spent bringing men back to the house . I 'll bet Tommy knows all about substitute fathers . Or did you make the big sacrifice and wait till he was asleep before you pulled down your hot pants ? It must have gotten inconvenient when he was big enough to notice what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his mother is. "  | " Well , three cheers ! Now we get Amanda , the protector of the young . You 'll have to give us a minute to adjust . Up till now , all we 've gotten has been Amanda the swinger , Amanda the girl who 's too with it to give up smoking pot . And who 's being the lily maid now ? Tell us about how you and Steve courted . Holding hands on the porch while you drank lemonade , was that how it was ? " Amanda for some reason had gone a brilliant crimson . " That 's none of your filthy business ! " she bellowed with surprising depth for so slight a girl . " Do you think that you had some kind of lifetime license on Steve ? Or have you forgotten how normal people act ? " As Amanda grew less controlled , Eunice became more so .
