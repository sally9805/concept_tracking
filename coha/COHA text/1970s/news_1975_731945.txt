txt As refugees beginning our evacuation journey to Thailand , we left the French Embassy in Phnom Penh April 30 M virtually the same chaos in which we had entered it 13 days earlier . In the predawn darkness there was milling and confusion in the Embassy yard as more than 500 of us clambered into 26 Soviet , Chinese , and American military trucks for the 250-mile journey . There were supposed to be 20 persons per truck , but darkness and confusion cover a multitude of things and some stowaways managed to sneak aboard . There were five  --  three Asian wives of Westerners whose papers were incomplete but who were fiercely determined to get out ; a child of one of them ; and a German television correspondent . ALL OF THEM , for reasons that can not be fully told here , got onto my truck , which contained , among other passengers , some Americans , Swedes , Bulgarians , and sevenausslans from their Embassy , with a mammoth load of luggage and food . The German newsman sat upright , buCthe other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ towels , bush hats , and other oddments . Somehow the officials who were checking the convoy never noticed them . At 0 a. m. , with the sun just coming up , the convoy moved out . As it did , we saw a fresh battalion of troops marching single file into the city from the north ? a mirror image of the battalion that marched in on the evening of April 17 when we entered the French Embassy . THEN THE scene changed and we met new images . The street lights burned , casting their artificial rays along the boulevards of a deserted city . Abandoned cars and assorted trash marked the trail of the missing population . In the courtyard of the Hotel Lc Phnom soldiers stood in morning formation . Another batallion formation was lined up down the street in front of the railway station ; similar formations were visible on adjoining streets . The soldiers stood with heads bowed , their weapons at their feet , as if in prayer . An anthem was being played ; it appeared to be some kind of morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open and looted . Not a single civilian was visible , Only soldieni camping in the shops and on the sidewalks . There were large numbers of them . , We suddenly turned right  --  that is , west  --  down the road to the airport , and this was puzzling because we were supposed to be heading north and northwest toward the Thai frontier . Our journey gave us a brief but revealing glimpse into the , covert spy system and communally organized countryside of Communists  --  a glimpse that , as far as is known , no westerners had ever gotten before . We traveled on some of the well-defended dirt roads they had built by hand and used as clandestine supply routes during the five years of the war that ended with their seizure of Phnom Penh . NONE OF these roads show on maps of . Cambodia , yet some were only half a mile or so from the main highways . We saw reservoirs , dikes , bridges-411 built with hand tools . No machines or earth-moving equipment were visible . We also saw boy militia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As we passed many of the villagers and soldiers , stared at us wonderingly as if they had never seen a white man before which is possible . FROM WHAT we could determine it seemed that these areas had been developed and organized over a long period and that they had remained untouched sanctuaries thruout the war . There were no signs that either American planes or planes of the old Phnom Penh government had bombed here , nor were there any signs that troops of the old government had tried to mount a ground assault against those areas . The trees bore no marks of bullet holes , as they always do when there has been ground fighting The over-all impression was striking . Some of th ehandhewn reservoirs , for example , had a terraced system that channeled water into an agricultural irrigation system . THE SUPPLY network that we got the best look at snaked thru thick forest and swampy ponds along a line that ran generally parallel to and west of Route 5 . It covered approximately 90 miles , running from near the town of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got the feeling as we traveled along these dirt roads , which were occasionally wide but often so narrow that tree branches along the sides thwacked against our trucks , that the village and countryside organization was much stronger than anyone on the other side had imagined . YET WHILE this organizational system was impressive , when we traveled on other roads we saw some depressing sights . Refugees forced out of Phnom Penh and other places were still plodding along , pushing carts and carrying heavy sacks of belongings over their , shoulders as they headed for the interior areas , where the Communists say they must now become peasants and grow rice . ? Abandoned and stripped cars littered some highways ; apparently city people bad start ed out in them and jetisoned when they ran out of fuel . There were other detritus too ? steel helmets and other militray equipment and weapons discarded on the run by the routed troops . Here and there were bodies , but it was difficult to tell if they were people who had succumbed to the hardships of the march or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
