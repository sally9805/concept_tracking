The First Church of God in tiny ( pop . 6,800 ) Benton , Ill. , has a new patron saint of sorts : Elvis Presley . The fundamentalist church 's affiliation with the late rock star began last February when the Rev. Lloyd Tomer was faced with a $1 million debt from the building of his new chapel . The 500 parishioners were praying daily for the Lord to show them some way to pay their debt when , according to Tomer , God answered in the person of one Robert Philpot , a Dallas oilman . In search of a promotion gimmick to introduce his new engine additive , called Add-A-Tune , Philpot offered to buy one of Presley 's planes ( for $2 million ) and take it on a fund-raising tour for the church . Next week , the Convair 880 , named Lisa Marie for Presley 's daughter , will take off on two wings and a prayer for the Dallas Cowboys Texas Stadium and the start of a three-month , 50-state tour . For $300 , visitors not only will get to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visited with friends , " but will receive 15 sets of color photos of the plane 's interior and twelve kits of Add-A-Tune engine booster . <P> " At times God says to me , ' Go get ' em , Tiger , ' and I go get ' em , " says Tomer . As a fund raiser , " this sure beats chili suppers . "
