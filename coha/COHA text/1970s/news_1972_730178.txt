txt A proposal to close the . city 's $540-million budget gap without imposing substantial new taxes ? and possibly avoiding new taxes altogether ? was made jointly yesterday by the , Controller , the Council President and the five Borough Presidents . " We 're trying to avoid all taxes , if possible , " said Controller Abraham D. Beame , the architect of the plan . The proposal is consistent with Mr. Beanie 's earlier contention that when Mayor Lindsay warned of layoffs and cutbacks in services , he had exaggerated the scope of the budget gap . The city officials ' plan calls for budget reductions of $146.5-million , without reductions in services , in such areas as collective bargaining and welfare eligibility plus $131.7-million in the use of " available funds , " from such sources as Federal funds for child-care services . Effect of Prop:kid When added to $200 ? million that Mr. Beame has already , proposed that the city borrow against the expectation of Federal revenue , in addition to the $200-million in increased borrowing power authorized by the Legislature , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gap could be substantially reduced , if not eliminated , by an upward revision of the estimate of general fund revenues for the new fiscal year , which begins July 1 . " The question of the moment is the extensive general-fund revenues , " Mr , Beame said . These revenues are estimated by the Mayor , and his'estimates are binding on the Board of Estimate . The Council , mean . while , is standing in the wings with $141-million worth of so . called " nuisance taxes " authorized by the Legislature but not enacted . The proposal was made yesterday by the entire Board of Estimate except for Mayor Lindsay despite his request at a Gracie Mansion meeting on Wednesday night that he be included and that the entire board work together " coopera-tively , " " The Mayor wanted every . body to jump in bed together , " said Donald R. Manes , Queens Borough President . " He wanted a joint meeting with joint input and joint proposals , but we did n't want to , ' Mr. Manes said . Meaning of Reticence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Lindsay pointed ; up not only the fact that Mr. Beanie is an undeclared candidate for Mayor , but also the fact that some board members wished to disassociate themselves from the Lindsay administration . The attitude of the board was underscored , when  --  at a recent Fifth Avenue parade on Solidarity Day , protesting the So viet oppression of the Jews ? a large group of Councilmen , Board of Estimate members and Congressmen marched 100 yards ahead of Mr. Lindsay , who walked alone . " Six years ago , everybody would . have crowded around him , wanting to be photographed with him , " one borough president commented . The proposal yesterday called for $43-million less for collective bargaining , $28-million in additional savings through accruals and $29-million in welfare " eligibility recheck , administrative tightening ' and improved economy . " Accruals , a standard city budget tactic , refers to the practice of requiring a city agency to get along with fewer employes than it . is authorized . One way of effecting accruals is by not promptly replacing employes who leave city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Health and Hospitals Corporation and a cutback in ' executive management jobs , $4-million less in overtime and saving $3-million by eliminating physicians and ext ecutive management personnel in superagencies and executive agencies . The ' sources of the increased available funds are $33-million in the city 's interest reserve in the teacher pension system , $88.7-million in Federal aid due for child-care services and $10 ? million in real property funds to finance repair appropria ? tions . Some of these revenue estimates were presumably available to the Mayor 's budget experts , who sometimes decline to make some figures public while appealing for a great deal of money from the , Legislature . Mayors normally squirrel away such funds for a rainy day , while Controllers often , seek to bring them to light . Welfare Problem Mayor Lindsay said in a statement released by his press office ; - " We are in the process now of working out a revised budget with the City Council . The Council leadership and I will meet with the Borough Presidents , Mr. Garelik and Mr , Beame thereafter . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Human Resources Administrator , told the City Council Finance Committee of the costly delay in cutting off aid to a welfare client who works . If a caseworker finds a client at work , and even sees the client working on a job tor which he is obviously being paid , Mr. Sugarman said , it takes two to five months to cut off public assistance and to start the process of recovering payments fraudulently obtained . The reason , he said , is that Federal law says that the aid can not be discontinued without a hearing , and that the , state ; which conducts ' the ? hearings , takes two to five months to get a case .. Councilman Robert I. Postel , a Manhattan Democrat , called it " moral and economic insanity " to prohibit the Commissioner from canceling aid to a welfare client who has no right to it . He asked why Mr. Sugarman had not sought to change the law . Mr. Sugarman said that while the state and city were very vigorous in dealing with the problems of fraud , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to keep the procedures under the Federal control .
