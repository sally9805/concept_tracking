No one was particularly suspicious when Movie Actor Mitsuyasu Maeno appeared at Tokyo 's Chofu Airport last week in a World War II kamikaze pilot 's uniform , complete with white scarf and with risingsun flags emblazoned on his right sleeve and on his warrior 's headband . As he rented a single-engine Piper Cherokee from a local flying club , he explained that he was merely doing a publicity turn for a new film on the 1944-45 suicide pilots . <P> So it seemed for a while after Maeno , 29 , took off , accompanied by a photo plane . But after half an hour of picture taking , Maeno radioed to his wingman that he had " something to do in Setagaya " -a Tokyo area that is home to Yoshio Kodama , the millionaire ultra-nationalist who had been Lockheed 's principal go-between in its efforts to use bribes to help sell its planes in Japan . <P> Minutes later , Maeno cut the Piper 's engine and shouted into his microphone the traditional kamikaze pilot 's farewell : Tenno Heika Banzai ! - Long Live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's house , where it slammed into a second-floor balcony and exploded in flames . Maeno died instantly . But neither Kodama , resting in another room , nor any of his family or staff was hurt . <P> <P> Maeno 's background included some porn film credits ( most recent : Tokyo Emmanuelle ) , two broken marriages and a previous suicide attempt . An ardent admirer of the ancient Japanese samurai code , he also esteemed Yukio Mishima , the flamboyant novelist who committed hara-kiri in 1970 to protest Japan 's loss of traditional values . Many members of Japan 's restive right wing have felt that Kodama damaged their cause by acting as a conduit for American bribes-an error that Maeno evidently was seeking to avenge . <P> The kamikaze ( divine wind ) attack was yet another tremor in the continuing Lockheed shokku . Prime Minister Takeo Miki has been under heavy fire in the Diet , where his Liberal Democrats hold a steadily shrinking majority , for striking a deal with the U.S. Government that seemed aimed at containing further revelations about the scandal . Opposition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Information resulting from U.S. investigations of the Lockheed affair will henceforth be passed confidentially to Japanese law agencies , and no names will be revealed publicly unless sufficient evidence is found for indictments . <P> Midnight Visits . The investigation by Japanese police , tax and customs agents has already yielded enough evidence to indict Kodama for falsifying his 1972 income tax returns . But Kodama , 65 , has been confined to his home for much of the time since a stroke in late 1975 , and whether he will ever face trial is doubtful . His doctor says that Kodama has been talking of receiving midnight visits from the ghost of an old friend , Vice Admiral Takijiro Onishi . The admiral , by chilling coincidence , planned the first kamikaze missions in the waning days of World War II . The day before the war ended Onishi committed hara-kiri-with a sword that had been given to him by Kodama.
