The idea sounded beguiling . In a letter to President Carter , California 's Representative John Burton wondered whether his drought-stricken state could import snow or runoff water-perhaps by pipeline or railroad-from inundated Eastern areas like Buffalo . But empty pipelines are not available , and state officials , after some reckoning on their calculators , found that 182 million railroad carloads of water or snow would be required to make up for California 's water shortage alone . Estimated cost of such an operation : $437 billion . <P> Other well-meaning if farfetched schemes have been suggested as instant solutions to the Great Western Drought . California 's Governor Jerry Brown received one proposal from a correspondent urging a statewide " psychic day , " during which California 's entire populace would join in a spiritual summons for rain . Another suggested a state give-away of disposable diapers , presumably to cut down on use of washing machines . Still another writer , offering to come to California and display his rainmaking skills , insisted : " The only thing I require is air fare and faith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common sense . One woman asked for a moratorium on watering cemeteries : " When the needs of the living are in danger , let the souls of the dead rest in peace a little dryer . " Other writers suggested bans on selling and filling water beds , using Jacuzzi baths and sprinkling golfing greens and tennis courts . One advocated cutting back on water-guzzling yard plants like camellias and azaleas ; cacti and other desert flora could be planted instead . <P> Some people were clearly thinking bigger . House Republican Leader John Rhodes of Arizona revived a ten-year-old proposal to divert some of Alaska 's Yukon River before it spills into the Bering Sea . The waters would be channeled instead to the Lower 48 . The cost of such a big ditch would be at least $200 billion , but some of that cost could perhaps be recovered by the generation of hydroelectric power as the water descended through the Canadian Rockies . <P> Perhaps the most intriguing scheme came from an imaginative scientist at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography . After an earlier drought in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Antarctica ( those from the Arctic would not be big enough ) to the California coast ; as they melted , fresh water could be siphoned out of the lakes that would form on top of them . The idea has impressed at least one country : petroleum-rich , water-poor Saudi Arabia . A French engineering firm hired by the Saudis is studying whether or not the plan is practical . Towed by six tugs , the French believe , an iceberg could make the 5,000-mile journey from the bottom of the world to the Red Sea port of Jidda in six months to a year . If the mountain of ice was large enough-say 85 million tons-and wrapped in insulating plastic , it would shrink by no more than 20% along the way , providing enough water to the desert kingdom to make the venture economically feasible .
