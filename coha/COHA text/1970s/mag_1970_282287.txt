IN the execution of U.S. foreign policy , the distance between William Rogers ' State Department suite and Henry Kissinger 's White House corner sometimes seems great enough to require its own hot line . One recent example of their divergent tactics , in fact , ended in a cable the Secretary of State received while he was still on a Far Eastern tour . Uncharacteristically apologetic , the President 's National Security Affairs Adviser recalled his remark to the effect that the U.S. ought to " expel " Russian troops from the Middle East . That remark , cabled Kissinger , had been unfortunate . <P> Last week it was Rogers who had to take a step back , this time over Indochina . Early last week , in an interview , he warned that the Cambodian invasion had brought the Indochina action no closer to a negotiated end . His view clashed with that of the President , who told a television audience that while " only time will tell , " he believed that the invasion would speed productive talks . <P> On Wednesday , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nixon line . In a press conference , he declared : " I think that probably the prospects for the next couple of months are not too bright . I do think that the prospects in the long run are still good . " He also said that the invasion , by speeding Vietnamization of the war , " does increase the probabilities that the enemy , somewhere along the line , will negotiate . " <P> The Administration 's apparent schizophrenia over Indochinese strategy followed a similar display over Middle East tactics . It was while Rogers ' fresh call for a settlement was still being considered by Egypt 's Nasser and his Soviet patrons that Kissinger made his reference to a possible need to " expel " Russian troops . And the President on TV deliberately brought up the Middle East to castigate " aggressive " Arab nations who " want to drive Israel into the sea . " <P> Rogers is known to feel that such bellicose public posturing lessens rather than enhances chances for successful talks ; as a lawyer and highly skilled negotiator , he knows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not made to feel weak by being shoved against the wall . He believes that , because the Egyptians now feel more confident , they might conceivably be more disposed to negotiate . He also believes that the Russians harbor the same suspicions against the U.S. that the U.S. harbors against them-but that the Russians really want some kind of Middle East settlement . Even if the President can not proceed on that assumption , Rogers feels that there is no need to talk publicly of the steps the U.S. is taking-and that occasionally there has been too much talk at San Clemente . Despite last week 's partial recantation , Rogers does not buy the theory that Hanoi will be willing to talk because the tide is turning against it .
