txt The city 's ailing taxi industry is studying proposals for group riding , the use of credit cards and assignment of special theater district dispatchers as part of a plan to recoup losses and win new riders . Still smarting from the public 's angry reaction to the 148 per cent fare increase three months ago , the cab owners land drivers are looking into a Ilnumber of new ways to im'prove their services . " We need an additional 28,000 rides a day just to break even , " said Arthur Gore , chief spokesman for the Metropolitan Taxi Board of Trade . Mr. Gore said patronage was still 17 per cent below the figure prior to the increase , adding that a 16 per cent decrease was the line between profit and loss . The industry 's proposals have been planned in conjunction with the new city Taxi Commission , Mr. Gore said . The commission , created as part of the legislative package that increased the fares , must approve any changes in service by licensed taxicabs . Taxi Commissioner Michael J. Lazar said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , probably on Aug. 1 . Each passenger will pay a percentage of what Mr. Lazar described as a " premium fare . " He said that that fare had not yet been determined . " We should be able to expand the program to other parts of the city within 30 days , " Mr. Lazar said . Mr. Lazar 's choice of La Guardia came as a surprise to leaders of the taxi industry . " We had an experiment there in 1968 , " one of them said . " It was the wrong airport to try it out because the fare is less than Kennedy and fewer people have baggage . " Mr. Gore said discussions were being held with a major credit card company about extending their service to taxis as a convenience for riders . He said , too , that the industry hoped to issue scrip books , which would be paid for in advance , to businessmen and other frequent riders . The scrip , good only in taxis , and credit cards , would make expense deductions easier to itemize and would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He noted , too , that negotiations were under way with several airlines to have discount coupons distributed to tourists and businessmen about to fly to New York . The coupons would entitle the holder to discounts on taxi rides between the airports and Manhattan . Aid to Theatergoers Commissioner Lazar said he was working with the taxi owners to set up special dispatchers in the theater district to organize queues and otherwise speed up service . " We 've been talking with the League of New York Theaters , " he said . " We think that by getting people home quickly and safely , we will encourage more of them to go out at night . " The dispatchers probably would be stationed on 45th and 46th Streets just before most of the shows ended each night . Eventually , Mr. Lazar said , he hopes to have a " flying squad " , of taxi dispatchers available for all major sports and cultural events in the city . The dispatcher system currently is used at Kennedy International Airport . Before the fare increase , taxi fleet owners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every day. , The increase was ' supposed to gross an additional $41-million a year and raise the pay of fleet drivers from $150 ' to $170 or $180 a week . Mr. Gore said the industry now hoped to gross about $26-million additional in the first year at the new rates . But out on the streets , some drivers were less sanguine . " Working five days before the increase , I made about $150 , " said Lester Trebony , a young driver with shoulderlength hair and blue jeans . " Now I 've got it back up to about $130 . " The Common Complaint Mr. Trebony lounged in his cab near the International Arrivals Terminal at Kennedy Airport . " The first two weeks after the fare hike , I did n't work at all , " he said . " My brother-in-law did . Some days he made $8 . " One common driver 's complaint was fewer fares and ' smaller tips . " We used to get a fare here every five minutes , " said a driver in the taxi line at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " At the Port Authority 's bus terminal in midafternoon , a double line of cabs reached from 41st Street back to 37th Street , and at La Guardia Airport , more than 100 cabs were waiting just at the Eastern Airlines Shuttle Terminal . Only the owner-drivers , who account for 4,963 of the city 's 11,799 city-licensed cabs , are reasonably happy about the new rates ? as they were when the increase went into effect March 2 . " If you 're working for yourself , you 've got to do better , " said Lazio Koltcher , an owner-driver working in midtown Manhattan . Under the new fare schedule , fleet drivers take home from 42 to 50 per cent of the daily bookings , depending on how long they have been driving . Owner-drivers keep everything but must pay for cab maintenance and operation , and usually are carrying a bank loan covering the cost of the city medallion , purchased from the previous owner and currently valued at about $24,000 . Members of Taxi Drivers Union Local 3036 also must pay 10 cents of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contract , which first outlined the new fair structure late last year , has yet to be ratified by the members , many of whom dislike the pension provision . Previously , the fleet owners picked up pension costs . Commissioner Lazar said that the Taxi Commission will have taken over most of the functions and all 40 civilian employes of the Police Department Hack Bureau by mid-July . He said policemen assigned to the bureau would be assigned to ether duties during the next three months .
