BEFORE THE DELUGE : A PORTRAIT OF BERLIN IN THE 1920 'S by OTTO FRIEDRICH 418 pages . Harper &; Row . $10 . <P> The Weimar Republic sort of happened about lunchtime , Nov. 9 , 1918 . <P> Philipp Scheidemann , the Social Democratic Party 's deputy leader , was having a bowl of potato soup in the Reichstag dining room when he was told that the Kaiser had abdicated and that Karl Liebknecht , the left-wing firebrand , was about to proclaim Germany a Soviet republic . To head him off , Scheidemann hurried to a balcony and shouted to the crowd below : " Workers and soldiers . The cursed war is at an end . The Emperor has abdicated . . . Long live the German Republic ! " That night , over a secret line from GHQ in Belgium , came a message for the Socialist leaders from the chief of staff : " The officer corps expects the government will fight against Bolshevism and places itself at the disposal of the government . " <P> So the revolution of 1918 was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the government and created the Weimar Republic . The real power , however , remained with the conservative army and the career bureaucrats in Berlin . It was later handed over to the political right and to Adolf Hitler . But before that happened , Berliners lived through one of history 's extraordinary decades . Rid of its tasteless Hohenzollern constraints , and at the same time having avoided the constricting new dogmas of Marxist revolution , Germany blossomed intellectually . In the liberal , democratic ' 20s , Berlin was feverish with new ideas in atonal music , Einsteinian physics , Freudian psychoanalysis , expressionist art , Bauhaus architecture , Brechtian theater , not to mention kinky sex and despairing occultism , all pursued against a counterpoint of political riot and assassination . <P> Vivid Portrait . The city and the decade provide a nostalgic paradox that has fascinated novelists , scholars and citizens from Christopher Isherwood and Hannah Arendt to the long lines currently waiting to see Liza Minnelli in Cabaret . Otto Friedrich has combined history and cultural journalism to produce the most vivid portrait of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and place between Marlene Dietrich and Joseph Goebbels , between Berlin and Hollywood , between 1920 memoirs and 1971 interviews , the author , who is a former managing editor of the Saturday Evening Post and now a TIME senior editor , has recreated Berlin , and his city moves .
