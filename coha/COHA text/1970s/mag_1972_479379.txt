IT TAKES AN Aw run LOT to embar-rass me , " he once said . That was in July 1962 , before he had been defeated for governor of California and was thought to have blown his cool in his concession speech . It was before his success as a Wall Street lawyer . something denied him when he went there for a job after Duke University Law School , before he became a rich man who could at last feel the equal of rich men , before his election to the Presidency , which had been stolen from him eight years earlier , if one is to believe the anger in the eyes of his wife whenever 1960 is mentioned . If it took a lot to embarrass him in 1962 , it would take prohibitively more in 1972 . He . was hard to embarrass then because he was willing to accept , even to court , personal humiliations that could be calculated to further his public ambitions ; and it is now nearly impossible to embarrass him personally because he has encapsulated himself in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abundantly clear that he considers himself indistinguishable from the Office he has earned , and that if he is forced to acknowledge embarrassment , the price may , in every sense of the word , prove exorbitant . The intensification of bombing in Vietnam ? featuring what are called " smart " bombs ? was explained with frightening insistence as necessary if respect for the Presidency was to be maintained , just as the earlier invasion of Cambodia was explained , in words even his advisers wanted to delete , as necessary if America was not to appear " a pitiful , helpless giant . " And when he says that he would rather be a one-term President than allow America to become a second-class power , he is not engaging in verbal play . He means that his position as first officer of the land will be maintained at whatever cost . Of course , any President is supposed to treat his Office as an extension of himself , to preserve its historical dignity with his'own . What is distressing about Nixon , however , is that personal dignity is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a consequence , his concern for the respect due his Office and the respect due the United States sounds less like a call to grandeur than a claim for psychic disability pay . It has a pathos familiar in the success stories of the American self-made man ; the position attained is made to substitute for personal attributes sacrificed in order to attain it . His conduct in the Office is continuous with the conduct that brought him there . From the outset he has acted in obedience to a narrowly conceived and contrived system of rewards and punishments , and he is at last himself in charge of the system . It is understandable that Nixon could never fully understand the altogether different success of Eisenhower , his regard for whom was always compounded of awe and resentment , and that Eisenhower , almost from the beginning of their political association , was . cool , patronizing , and impatient . He wanted Nixon off the ticket in 1952 , having put him there at the behest of Dewey , until the Checkers speech made it impossible to remove him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 1956 with his suggestion that Nixon should : chart his own course , " perhaps toward a Cabinet post ; and he had . badly damaged Nixon 's Presidential campaign in 1960 by the supposedly offhand remark , when asked what decisions Nixon had been responsible for in the previous eight years , that " If you give me a week , I might think of one . I do n't remember . " With a Richard Poirier 's Inns. , recent beaks are The Perfuming Self and Mailer ( a critical study ) . blend of effeminate retaliation and conciliatory fear characteristic of his dealings with Eisenhower even in print , Nixon later wrote in Six Crises that he was " far more complex and devious than most people realized , and in the best sense of those words " and that " despite his great capacity for friendliness , he also had a quality of reserve which , at least subconsciously , tended to make a visitor feel like a junior officer . " Eisenhower 's relation to Nixon was that of a lord of nature to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had so little shame that sometimes he prevailed did not contribute to the lord 's esteem . During his occupancy of the White House , Eisenhower never once asked the Nixons into the family quarters , as they pathetically admitted to the Johnsons in 1967 while being shown what was to be their new home . Eisenhower is a particularly instructive contrast to Nixon , as Garry Wills ' Nixon Agonistes eloquently demonstrates , because their close political affiliation only exaggerates the sharp differences between them . The Presidency sought Eisenhower as much as he sought it ; and he served with a kind of aristocratic carelessness , as if the Office was more enhanced thereby than he was . He had spent most of his life conforming to the disciplines and outdistancing the intrigues of the peacetime Army , but there was no evidence of any injury to the autonomy of his personality or the openness of his charm ; and though he was never able to settle anywhere with his wife and son and was often abroad , he emerged like an illustration for the state of Kansas . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acts like some anxious conniver up the ranks , the barracks politico , a rootless and regimented loan . Even though , for me , there are no other recent Presidents to be nostalgic about , 1 would n't want to assist the growing nostalgia for Eisenhower that is a legacy of the Kennedy , Johnson , and Nixon Administrations . His impenetrable self-satisfactions helped produce a national apathy that is being dispelled only by the disasters it invisibly helped produce . For all that , it can at least be said of him that no one 's imagination was perplexed by the fact that he became the thirty-fourth President of the United States . Even admirers of Nixon wonder how he became the thirty-seventh . There is a gap between his finicky , almost prudish expenditures of personality and the grandeur of his Office , between the pettiness of his moral imagination with respect to such matters as Kent State or Lieutenant Calley or the nomination of G. Harrold Carswell to the Supreme Court and the enormous consequences of even his minor decisions ? a gap so yawning as to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and directions of power in this country . When it comes to personal stature , no man or woman under the glaring exposure of the media may ever again satisfy our literary images of what a President should be like ; maybe Jefferson would n't . Allowing for that , Nixon still provokes an interest unique to him . He does not seem so much a predictable product of contemporary circumstances in America as the harbinger and sponsor of them . In the often poignant testimony of a former aide and admirer , Catch the Falling Flag by Richard J. Whalen , Nixon emerges as a man who neither offers nor provokes a positive belief in anything , who is more interested in political gimmickry than in government . The indictment is the more effective for coming from an avowed conservative . One might want to argue with this assessment by proposing . as has Rev. Charles Henderson , Jr. , in the New York Times of July 3 , 1972 , that Nixon represents " a manifestation of the Protestant ethic so long a part of the American political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as in his objection to welfare reform that does not include a work requirement , his rejection of a federal system of day-care centers on the ground that it would weaken the American family and what he imagines to be its support of " moral and religious principles , " his arguments against legalized abortion and the removal of criminal penalties for the private use of marijuana , and his contemptuous dismissal of the report of the Commission on Obscenity and Pornography . What is important in all this , however , is not the workings of a so-called Protestant ethic but the evidence that in Nixon it works only negatively , in a way , as Reverend Henderson himself observes , that is " particularly anachronistic and divisive . " Whatever principles he has usually express themselves in a veto . Veto power is a perfectly apt metaphor for Nixon . He seems to exist in the absence of those who might be there if it were not for death or deprivation . He exists in negation . and one reason for a general lack of relish for his personality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stigma of all we have lost . He is the heir of our maladroitness and our disasters ? the assassination of John Kennedy ; the debacle of Goldwater ; the demise of Johnson , who might have been a good President ; the killing of Robert Kennedy ; the doomed nomination of Humphrey ; the self-defeat of Vietnam with its roots in a debasing Communist-conspiracy theory . Even before all this he thrived , as it were , on misfortune : the Red scare that let him defeat Voorhis and Helen Douglas by lies and innuendos , the prominence he earned in the Hiss case , the obscenity of the Checkers speech , the heart attacks of Eisenhower that left him an aging and arrogant sybarite even less willing than before to take stands that might disturb his glory and the unaccustomed luxuries that went with it . Our diminishment came down to the measure of Nixon 's own self-miniaturization , and he and the Presidency could be one at last . N IXON IS A HOLE IN SPACE with the gravitational pull of a star . He is therefore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the imagination is supposedly most free in its explorations ? like fiction , drama , and film . Some measure of the difficulties of imagining Richard Nixon , and some clue as to how these difficulties might be met. are to be found in four recent efforts . There is Mill-house , a documentary film by Emile de Antonio shown first in September 1971 and to be released again before the election : Our Gang ( Starring Tricky and His Friends ) , a fictional satire on the Nixon style by Philip Roth ; An Evening with . Richard Nixon , a play , or spectacle . by Gore Vidal , the title of which I to suggest that it was also an evening with the American people ) was extended with an " And ... " for its lamentably brief New York run in April : and , most recently , the film Richard , done by Lorees Yerby and produced by her husband Bertrand Castelli . the executive producer of Hair . While none of these entertainments is favorable to Nixon , the two that are least smugly dogmatic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also turn out , for all their frailties , to be the best . Yerby and Vidal do not isolate Nixon from the rest of America or its historical lapses , though in the case of Richard the history is mostly cinematic . They proceed on an assumption that is both politically and theatrically rewarding : that Nixon is an expression , though a deformed one , of certain practices and inclinations that are recognizably American . and that his success raises the possibility that these practices and inclinations might , at this point in our development , be deforming the rest of us . Their stance is much like Garry Wills ' in Nixon Agonisfe.s , though they are working in forms that do n't allow them to argue with Wills ' immense subtlety . Wills postulates a detailed interchangeability between Nixon 's career and the nation 's , so that the speeches of Woodrow Wilson , for example , who is Nixon 's favorite President , are seen as " a solid bridge across our recent history , a bridge that leads from Horatio Alger straight to Richard Nixon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constricted , so careful to keep things remote from him , " is matched to the unease and discontent of a country become defensively assertive about its lost certitudes . While . like Wills , Vidal and Yerby try to make us aware of some degree of complicity with Nixon , De Antonio and Roth allow us to feel politically hygienic . The aesthetic distance and disdain from which they choose to view Nixon are equivalent to the social snobbery of a period when the President of the United States was not always thought socially acceptable . De Antonio 's reliance on familiar outtakes from newsreels arid TV tapes , selected and juxtaposed to " embarrass " Nixon . has finally the same effect as Roth 's reliance on mimickHORATIO ALGER IN THE WHITE HOUSE ing his equally familiar mannerisms of speech . The implication is that the man is his style . Although this adage might have meant something in the eighteenth century , it means next to nothing in so extensively programmed and stylistically eclectic an age as our own . The effort to locate a contributory relationship between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ film a kind of carnival energy , sometimes even a repetitious insistence on the fusions of fact and fiction , history and myth , theater and documentary . Along with flashing film shots in the background , hellzapoppin sound effects , and a whole panoply of masked notables , including a chorus of the American public , Vidal invents a heavenly grouping of Washington , Eisenhower , and John Kennedy as commentators , judges , and finally themselves defendants , so that each of Nixon 's banalities is made an echo of some national hero or some fragment of the national past . Nixon is thus placed in a gravitational field rather than in a shooting gallery where he is the only target , and it matters less that we agree with each of the correspondences made between him and others than that we are made , in every sense of the word , to entertain them . Nixon 's very drabness , for example , partakes of the American idea that practicality and studiousness are prerequisites for rewards on a scale conunensurate with " this great country of ours . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while in the Navy made his own Poor Richard 's Almanac , as we learn from Edwin P. Hoyt 's . The Nixons : An American Family . He compiled lists of rules for success as given by , among others , Ben Hecht and Bernard Baruch , from whom he copied the maxim , " A speculator is one who observes the future and acts before it occurs . " T SHOULD N'T BE surprising that in I his own sedated way a man so interested in programming himself for predicted ends should also have been interested in the theater . He is known to have courted only two women in his life : Ola-Florence Welch , whom he met in a Whittier High School play where each had a lead in Aeneas and Dido and who went out with him for six years ; and the woman he was to marry , Pat Ryan , whom he met at a tryout for a Little Theater play in Whittier . He was the director and male lead in the play , The Trystirrg Place , he helped write for his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came in handy when he wept on the shoulder of Senator Knowland at the reunion with Ike after the Checkers speech ? by the drama director at Whittier for a play called Bird in the Hand . It is characteristic of Nixon that evidence of his predilections often exists in his denial of them , and this is noticeably true in his taste for the theater . In this , his treatment of himself is very much like his treatment of others . After all , part of his standard repertory when he wants to establish the validity of a charge is to deny that he is making it . It was already a familiar enough trick when he got round to saying that " I and Agnew will question the policies but not the loyalty of the Democratic candidates . " Before that there had " never been any doubt in my mind about Mr. Truman 's complete loyalty " and " no question in my mind as to the loyalty of Mr. Stevenson " and " no doubt whatever about Senator Kennedy 's loyalty to his country . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his own self-characterization , so that when he speaks , in disparaging terms , of acting , as he often does in Six Crises and elsewhere , he in fact gives us the best evidence not of his own sincerity but of his act of sincerity . Thus , in his account of the Hiss-Chambers confrontation , he tells us that Hiss " overacted , " that he had " put on a show , " while in accounting for a break in Chambers ' voice during his testimony , he says that " this one incident was to have considerable bearing upon my attitude toward him because I did not feel it was an act . " In Nixon : A Political Portrait , Mazo and Hess report that his disgust at the McCarthy-Army hearings prompted the remark that prefer professionals to amateur actors , " and that he opposed televising committee hearings because " there is inevitably too much of a tendency for both the witnesses and the committee members to play to the cameras rather than the facts . " A pretension to honesty , a disavowal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to factuality is his way of playing to the cameras , as in the Cambodia speech where , with a map and a pointer , he justified the invasion as an attack on the " headquarters forthe entire Communist military operations in South Vietnam " though he must have known no such headquarters existed . His speeches are structured , their contents largely predetermined by those canned assertions of veracity of which Roth makes so much in his book : " I could have done the popular thing , " " I want to make one thing perfectly clear , " " now these are facts , " " to be perfectly candid . " The act of candor seems to have been his speciality from the outset . When his late mother , apparently a genuinely saintly woman , was asked in 1960 if there was a " new Nixon , " she confirmed what his record indicates : " No . He has always been exactly the same . I never knew a person to change so little ... he was very mature even when he was five or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeming openness , even if this involves humiliating himself , is carefully contrived for eventual political profit is perhaps most evident in the Checkers speech . What is quite frighteningly impressive in the whole performance , as Wills ' masterly analysis shows , is that the claim to an unmatched honesty with the American people ( " Now what I am going to do ? and incidentally this is unprecedented in the history of American politics ? I am going to give ... a complete financial history " ) was coolly directed not to the people at all but to Eisenhower , who would have been forced , had he not reluctantly accepted Nixon 's factual explanations , to make his own financial report to the nation . Nixon knew , as did some others , about the tax write-off allowed by Truman especially for Ike 's benefit to cover royalties from his best-selling Crusade in Europe . Such premeditated candor , such calculated self-exposure , such a tough willingness to be demeaned in the interests of an eventual reward ? all this was in evidence , however , even before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pat Ryan at the Little Theater . He proposed to her on the spot . " I thought he was nuts or something , " she said some time later , according to Mazo and Hess . " I guess I just looked at him . I could n't imagine anyone saying anything like that so suddenly . Now that I know Dick much better I ca n't imagine that he would ever say that , because he is very much the opposite , he 's more reserved . " He knew what he wanted , nd if one act did n't work , its opposite light . But nothing " embarrassed im " personally . He courted her for NO years and she married him , even lough he sometimes had had to drive er into Los Angeles and wait to drive er back while she dated other fellows . Iroughout every aspect of his career Tixon has been at once the actor and re director of a play in which the self as been made up . fashioned for the ttainment of a goal . ' T IS THEREFORE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as le film Richard does , within a cluster f associated cinematic images heaving to the Nixon years and to irround him with stock theatrical gures of the same period . Because the three characters in Richard who Nixon going in politics are meant remind us of some early comedy . arras like the Ritz Brothers , the Three tooges , or the Marx Brothers , they 7e also a stage Irishman , a stage I taln , and a stage Southern Cracker . here are many such who have arned how to act out their lives , and ars too , from the movies , and the ifluence , however indirect , of lit ? ary convention . Gangster films are about the only nd of which Richard does n't offer incorporated sample , though the terview between the Nixon figure id the three comedy-team politicos imics a gangland recruitment scene ' en to a plan to send Nixon off for face change . Before that change ixon is played by the kind of young an they seldom make anymore : - es bright with visions approved by god Housekeeping , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right thing for himself , id that kind of haircut that probity can only be gotten nowadays in e basements of a few refined and . piring hotels . For the operation at will make him a " new Nixon , " e young man travels to a cliff-side ansion on the sea . It is. of course , a my night lit by flashes of lightning , scene somehow so familiar as to be assignable to whatever old mystery al the footage is from . At this int the motif of a " new Nixon " is sed with the Frankenstein legend , mplete with the surgeon among his eletons , a lip smacking , hand-rubag John Carradine who prepares 3 patient and later , in a moment it has featured Bogart and others . removes the wrapped bandages with aghast surprise at the results . And there revealed is the " new Nixon , " as he looked in some unflattering newsreel shots of the Forties , glum-faced , twitching a smile in response to proddings and to assurances from his troika that after a while the swelling in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TV outtakes of Nixon , most of them unused footage never publicly shown , are not merely interspersed with fictional materials . By very adroit editing , the two are so fully coordinated that the real Nixon is made to answer the dialogue and even take orders from fictional characters . The point is that the real Nixon is as much a product of film fiction as of the film documentary . There arc in fact three Nixons in Richard : the young man played by Dan Resin ; the older politician played by Richard Dixon , who closely resembles the President ; and Nixon himself . So adept is the pattern by which one of these is constantly being exchanged for the other that all fuse into the man who becomes President . The young man is first introduced in a log-cabin scene , from countless early movies about the beginnings of great men and from hillbilly classics one associates with the young Henry Fonda . Sitting with Ma and Pa on either side , he dutifully mashes potatoes , an in joke to those who know a bit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the best potato masher one could wish for . Even in these days when I am visiting Richard and Pat in Washington , or when they visit me , he will take over the potato mashing . My feeling is that he actually enjoys it . " This same young man is then shown at Whittier in some old footage from rah-rah college flicks , along with some scenes , unflatteringly close to the truth , in which his role on the football team is a combination of tackling dummy and bench-warming booster . The fictional freedom exercised in the film is considerable , with direct allusions to , among others , here Comes Mr. Jordan , The Devil and Daniel Webster , and especially the treatment scenes in the B. F. Skinner clinic of A Clockwork Orange . The political implications are no less far ranging . though one wonders how often they are actually intended . There are too many stray moments that are n't apparently meant to be funny or cloying at all , and yet these and similar hits take place in a film that has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ satiric implications . The young Nixon figure is put in the infantry , rather than in the Navy , and involved in a fire action , which Nixon never was , made up of war films from the Forties and newsreels showing General MacArthur in his famous wading scene ? just before he changed into dry pants . ( The Nixon figure mistakes the wading party for the arrival of reinforcements . So blatantly commonplace is the film material that is being used that these cinematic distortions of the actual war constitute a comic mythologizing of Nixon . And like any good mythologizing , the kinds found in Richard are as close to approximating reality as are the so-called facts , especially when Nixon manipulates them as he does in the Checkers speech : " I went to the Pacific . I guess I 'm entitled to a couple of battle stars . I got a couple of letters of commendation , but I was there when the bombs were falling . " The pretend humility when there were ample grounds for real humility , the indifference to deserved honors ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pro forma , and the outrageous vagueness of " when the bombs were falling " ? this is the sort of thing Vidal delights in exposing to the prodding , choral inquiries of Generals Washington and Eisenhower . Nixon 's deception about his war record deserves to be beaten at its own game by the kind of outrageous fictionalizing to which the Yerby film exposes it . Developing a fiction to a limit beyond Nixon 's own is perhaps the only way of encouraging some restoration of the truth . N OW AND THEN , De Antonio 's Mill-house makes use , in an elementary way , of similar mixtures of film fact and film fantasy , as when it shows Nixon , in his acceptance speech of 1968 , calling out to the Convention , " Let 's win this one for Ike , " a line he could afford , having won , to delete when the speech was reprinted in the new edition of Six Crises . Immediately after this moment in the film clip , De Antonio cuts to a locker-room scene in Knute Rockne , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the Gipper , " and then to the hospital room of the Gipper himself , played by the present governor of California . Garry Wills uses literary analogies in a similar way in Nixon , Agonistes . Indeed his title is the only unfortunate thing about the book in not sufficiently indicating that it is much more about America , and specifically the wreckage of the liberal tradition , than about its President . Nixon 's attitudes and styles are seen as extensions , however pale , of Horatio Alger in his fixation on merit and the self-made man , Uriah Heep and his unctuous " ' umbleness , " even Emerson with his cult of self-improvement and starting anew . Wills ' emphasis is primarily historical and political , however , and there are important literary analogies he chooses not to make : to Cooper 's Deerslayer , for example , with his ennobling Christian endeavor , about which he is tiresomely voluble even while exercising a taciturn , technical proficiency in the mastery of nature ; or to Gatsby , who , like most American heroes , has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visions of the future . I It should also be noted that just as Gatsby claimed to have gone to Oxford , so , as Nixon told Jules Witcover in 1968 , ? If I had my druthers I 'd like to go to one of the fine schools ? Oxford , for instance ? just teach , read , and write . " ) And in his notorious efforts at control , personal and political , Nixon is an extension of the rationalistic , pragmatic tradition that Faulkner brilliantly characterized in the Sutpen of Absalom , Absalom ! Sutpen , too , had a " design " on history and moved in obedience to a behavioristic creed in which " the ingredients of morality were like the ingredients of pie or cake and once you had measured them and balanced them and mixed them and put them into the oven it was all finished and nothing but pie or cake could conic out . " To put so ashen a figure as Nixon in this company will not seem inappropriate if it is noted that , as personalities , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ color we associate with them belongs to the aura of their position , to the myths they are made to represent . The Emersonian man . Deerslayer , Gatsby , Sutpen. not to mention Horatio Alger and Uriah Heep , are in fact rather odd , rather quiet , rather glum , rather inward . " He 's like a polite but distant hermit , " Stewart Alsop quotes a White House aide as saying of Nixon . " He emerg every once in a while from his cat blinks in the light , and then goes ha again . " The flamboyance of style in t books where such types appear is clue less to their nature than to the effect ; it accounts not for their d.a . habits , which are for the most In like Nixon 's ? so simple and methoi cal , so . full of raw persistence ai distrust ? hut for the public con : consequences of those habits . And t analogy holds for public behavior le When they speak or act it is not free or gregariously , as if their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ designs , " but rather the other w around , as if they were compelled them . Acutely uncomfortable in In human interchange , their language stilted : their human enthusiasms. li Nixon 's for sports , ring false , and the tension of personal encounti that ca n't be managed by the rem ( control of prepared rhetoric , they c appear awkward to the point-of lu crousness . One such instance , wh Nixon talked to some soldiers in Vi narn , is taken verbatim by Vidal fn a report in Newsweek : " Nixon : ' A where are you from ? ' /Soldil ' Texas . ' / Nixon : ' Texas ! I'l l darned . Think the Cowboys can b. the Packers this year ? ' / Soldier : hope so , sir . ' / Nixon : ' They 've I their quarterback you know . A where are you from ? ' / Soldier : C cago. ' / Nixon : ' Chicago ! Have y seen the Cubs this year ? They mil take it all . Are von a Cub or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm a Yanl fan , sir . ' / ( Nixon stares unhappily the black soldier . Neither can thi of anything to say . ) Nixon : ' Do ) ever get any black-eyed peas or lard greens out here ? ' / Black sold ( stunned ) ) : ' I 'm from Boston . ' " HERE IS , OF COURSE , a differeu 1 between Nixon and compara or contributory fictional figures . r difference is in the medium in wh they find themselves . The fictio characters are in a medium , I novels , that can protect them fr ridicule . The media in which Ni : finds himself ? that of his great Off of television , of cameras recording movements even when he doe know it , of interviews and the gra of friends , foes , and family ? is a gether less available to control . He his efforts at self-control become e more anxiously resolute than his driving ambition alone would make them . This intensification of effort is then the further subject of exposure , of very often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would appear to be at a great disadvantage in the media he must Cope with . He has managed not to be disadvantaged thanks to the same techniques by which his best acts consist in the denial of acting , his worst smears in the denial of smearing . What he has done , faced with unflattering and inescapable public exposures , is to become the agent of his own exposure . This simple but effective expedient is wittily dealt with in Richard , which ends with the three Nixon Stooges sitting in a movie house , the lights up , admiring their handiwork ? namely , the film we have just seen as something that will guarantee the reelection of their boy to a second term . Nixon 's adaptation to the new media of exposure is at once demeaning and profitable . It reveals how little he cares about the literary values of personal " dignity " that constrain the rest of us and most other political leaders . Since exposure is inevitable , do it yourself , beat the media at their own game , disarm them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is one additional reason why it is important to recognize the fantastic degree of collaboration between Nixon and all aspects of the theater , including the so-called documentary ones . The kinds of exposure to which public figures have to submit , and that they and the networks arrange ? the settings usually simple , the interviews unrehearsed , the formats relatively open ? can of course sometimes be damaging , as in Nixon 's televised conversations last January with the admirably tough Dan Bather . It might be wondered , then ; why Nixon allows such interviews when he does n't have to or when he could pick someone who would go easier on him . The reason probably is that the consequences of any predictable damage are negligible when compared to the predictable rewards . By which I mean that we are lulled into thinking ourselves witness to revelations when all we are seeing , as against the realities of power and politics , is a pretense to revelation . Candid camera was invented by Richard Nixon . He sweats , his eyes onk permanently dulled , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he can only chop the air ; he makes tiresome formulations , and he has a repetitious style . He knows all this ; he ca n't help it . Indeed , he makes such a point of revealing it so fully that we should long ago have wondered what in the process is not being revealed . Perhaps the true and terrible answer is that there is n't much more , much more of him , that is . The secret may be his vacuity pressured into a semblance of being by the concentrated impingement of various social and political forces around an emptiness we call Nixon . And we become so fascinated with anything that promises to fill that emptiness that we ignore the realities that hold it in place . W hat Roth and , to a lesser extent , De Antonio contribute to , what Vidal tries to avoid and the Yerby film at its best manages to transcend , is one of the insidious tendencies now at work in this country : the persistent habit , abetted by electronic media , of reading too much into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the way a man handles a handkerchief , of analyzing his taste for banalities and his resort to trickery as if these , and not some inveterate tendencies of our national life , were responsible for his having gotten away with the Checkers speech t because it was soap opera ) and squeaked through with the Cambodia speech t because it was Mission Impossible 1 . We arc all encouraged to care more for his manners than for the structure of his behavior , as it mirrors some of the larger operating structures of the society and its predilections . ' FRYING TO " EMBARRASS " Richard 1 Nixon has become the opiate of the in people , hooked all the more by his seductive advice that it takes an awful lot to do la . However infrequent his press conferences have become , he has made us bother too much with his every verbal and bodily tic , his every excess ? like his love of seclusion . his lack of relish for food and drink ( " 1 eat proteins , " he told reporters in Portland , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheese , cottage cheese .

" . ) ? his financial position , his /04 being constantly on the alert for humiliation and anything that will make him , the Presidency , the nation , seem impotent . What 's more , the revelations come in large part directly from liim ? and from close associates and members of his family , none of whom seems aware that what they say may prove " embarrassing . " " He 's really easygoing , " said his son-in-law David , grandson of Ike . " A lot of fun , and has a good sense of humor ? the perfect father for a teenage serial . " Obviously David does n't mean this as a ' rundown . That 's just the way things happen to come out , somehow , whenever the Eisenhowers talk about Dick . The reason it takes such an awful lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it comes to the difference between literary and political values , and both tenacious and shrewd in exploiting the literary ones without ever succumbing to their blandishments . Like the true Skinnerian man ? which is why Richard allows him to cast off the redundancy of treatments designed to make him one ? Nixon is indifferent to such literary values as " freedom and dignity . " They concern him not as a person but only as they belong to the rewards he has earned as President ; nor was he ever , in pursuit of the Presidency , deterred by any violations of his own " freedom and dignity . " As Gatsby might say , such considerations are " merely personal . " Indeed , even the dignity of his Office is treated not as an end but as a resource in the continual urgency , the world over , for a degree of rational conformity and systematization equivalent to what he has imposed on his own minority impulses , however much they may sometimes assert themselves by the accidents of speech or gesture . These accidents can make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some degree of mechanization , of systematization of movement that suddenly gets broken , of speech that gets unexpectedly upset or made inappropriate by some change of context , as when Nixon moved to California and announced that " I am running for Governor of the United States .. I mean of California . " The entertainments about him take full advantage of all this indeed , such comedy is inherent not only in the way Nixon acts but , with alarming frequency , in the way we act as a people . It is a national characthristic as well as a Nixonian one to treat what does not conform at first with amusement , then with toleration , and then ? if the nonconformity does not give way to some accommodation we consider " reasonable " with retaliation . It never seems to occur to the Nixonian kind of American that the accidents and misfortunes that befall them should be blamed not on efforts to disrupt systems but on the very nature of the systems they have imposed upon thernselvesohat what appear to be minority or dissident voices may in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those invented for the advancement of careers or of empires . It is therefore genuinely difficult for Nixon to understand the resistance of the Vietnamese to proposals or working arrangements that seem to him eminently reasonable , even generous . Their continued struggle for independence of our hegemony is to him a willful resistance to the natural order of things . They are " one small country , " as Henry Kissinger put it . There is a Nixonian testiness in that phrase , an impatience with assertions of human " freedom and dignity " that threaten such systematic efforts at the mechanization of life as Nixon proposes to extend from himself to the nation and , by a Great Power accommodation , to the world . With peculiar mixtures of generosity and intimidation , Nixon 's method for controlling the unmanageable aspects of life has evident dangers . So great is his faith in the logic of conformity , in the studied correction of mistakes . so convinced does he make himself that he has done all any rea. sonable man can be expected to do under the circumstances ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any persistence thereafter of devi , ation is taken as an intolerable affront to America and to reason . That is the particular danger , it would seem , it Nixon 's domestic political promotion of his meetings in Moscow and Pe . king . The soap opera of easy accom modation can , for him and for man ) Americans , turn under stress rather quickly into the melodrama of be trayal . To encompass the reality o : Richard Nixon in America and o America in Richard Nixon require the wildest and yet most subtle hal ante of comedy and melodrama , soai opera and satire , documentation am parody , reason and madness . We an still healthy enough to understant such a spectacle should anyone be irn aginative enough to contrive it .
