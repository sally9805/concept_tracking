The inscription on the framed photograph of Milwaukee Bucks Center Kareem Abdul-Jabbar reads : " For a true friend in all seasons . " The legend on the picture of Bruce Walton ( Bill 's brother ) says : " Maybe it 's corny , but I love you . " The object of such unabashed affection is a millionaire Los Angeles building contractor , Sam Gilbert . His own three children are grown , and for Gilbert , 61 , U.C.L.A. athletes-past and present-are now his family . Gilbert is their confidant , business adviser and surrogate father . Hence the nickname : <P> " Papa Sam . " <P> A U.C.L.A. alumnus , Gilbert attends most home games and occasionally travels with the team . Gilbert 's luxurious Pacific Palisades house , with 50-ft. swimming pool and well-stocked refrigerator , serves as a second home for the athletes . " The kids are hungry for a bit of home life , " explains Gilbert 's wife Rose , who teaches English at Pacific Palisades High School . " They love having this hangout . " Bill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a basketball team tradition at the Gilberts ' that ranks next to Sunday bagels-and-lox brunch , Walton ( on a dare ) gleefully wolfed down an entire pumpkin pie smothered with a quart of ice cream . When Bill came down with a severe strep throat last season , he went to the Gilberts ' to recuperate . Says Walton of Sam : " He 's just a great dude . " <P> Gilbert 's study , filled with photographs and trophies that Walton has won ( " Bill 's not much for trophy collecting " ) , also serves as a counseling office for troubled players . The problems ? <P> " You name it , " Gilbert says .

The wedding was in conservative Orange County , and Gilbert suggested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perform the ceremony . " We all loved the idea of blowing some minds in Orange County by having a black clergyman officiate at the marriage of a white couple , " says Gilbert . <P> - Papa Sam began his relationship with U.C.L.A. basketball in the mid-1960s , when former All-America Willie Naulls brought two disgruntled sophomores , Lew Alcindor ( now Jabbar ) and Lucius Allen , to him for some counseling . Alcindor and Allen in turn brought their teammates , and Sam eventually negotiated the professional contracts of Alcindor , Allen and other Bruin stars , such as Sidney Wicks , Henry Bibby and Nater . Like all his other services , Gilbert 's agentry comes free . " I do it because I 'm a friend and also a savvy businessman who knows most of the tricks and clauses that the kids have no knowledge about . " <P> When-and if-Bill Walton decides to negotiate a professional contract , Gilbert will call the financial shots . The San Diego Conquistadors , hoping to capitalize on the father-son relationship , recently approached Gilbert about buying the club . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bill 's friend , not his owner , " he said .
