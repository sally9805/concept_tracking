THE NEW OXFORD BOOK OF ENGLISH LIGHT VERSE Edited by Kingsley Amis ; Oxford ; 347pages ; $13.95 <P> " Never apologize/ For what you anthologize . " So , if anyone had thought of it , might run the motto for this entertaining and occasionally exasperating selection of poetic japes and fripperies . Novelist Kingsley Amis is not just a wickedly funny writer ( read Lucky Jim several times ) ; he is also a critic known for his strong and aggressively idiosyncratic opinions . With the venerable Oxford imprimatur on his side , Amis ' poetastering now becomes what the next several generations of readers will have to swallow . <P> That will not be hard to do . Amis ' anthology is almost totally unlike the first Oxford Book of Light Verse , compiled by W.H. Auden and published 40 years ago . For all its literary ground breaking and the recognition it brought to nonserious poetry , Auden 's collection displayed crippling drawbacks : much of it was of the hey-nonny-nonny variety , and too much of it was not funny . This lapse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ verse ; far more important , he claimed , was the quality of common speech that all classes of society could understand . Milton wrote for the educated elite ; the light-versifier hummed to a simpler , more general rhythm and turned his hand to things like this : <P> My lady is a prety on , A prety , prety , prety on , My lady is a prety on As ever I saw . <P> Egalitarian principles aside , a little bit of this ( and Auden printed a lot ) goes a long , weary way . <P> Amis , on the other hand , does not give a rap about poetry for the masses . His aim , he writes , was to put together " a reactionary anthology , " and he has succeeded . Defining light verse is like breaking the idea of a butterfly on the wheel , and Amis wisely avoids stating last words on the subject . But his general categories are small enough to exclude Chaucer , Skelton , Dryden , Pope , Burns and most of Edward Lear ( " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of discomfort " ) . Amis wants poems that raise " a good-natured smile . " He argues that " light verse need not be funny , but what no verse can afford to be is unfunny . " He stresses the technical hurdles that the light poet must erect and then clear ; since he is up to something trivial , the artist must do it perfectly . " A concert pianist , " Amis writes , " is allowed a wrong note here and there ; a juggler is not allowed to drop a plate . " <P> As Amis ' introduction piles condition upon condition , the fear arises that his book will consist of blank pages . Instead , the anthology presents nearly 300 separate entries , the work of more than 120 poets . The only major writer to receive substantial space is Byron . Though it is preferable to read Don Juan whole , Amis ' excerpts do underscore this long poem 's consistent , sparkling hilarity . Byron on government bureaucrats is , unfortunately , still timely . Ask a neighbor , he advised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bar To freedom , he applied ( a grief and a bore ) , If he found not in this spawn of tax born riches , Like lap dogs , the least civil sons of bitches .
