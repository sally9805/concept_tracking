 | The : Mafia Tightens Its Grip on the Teamsters @# ON Sunday , June 11 , 1972 , Lloyd Hicks announced that he would run for president of Teamster Local 390 , Miami . On Tuesday , gunmen killed him . " They ca n't kill all of us , " Travis Dumas , Hicks ' best friend and fellow business agent , announced . " I 'm running in Lloyd 's place . " Dumas hired a guard and set out to win control of the local 's 2700 members , many of whom had been terrorized . Dumas won , but word soon came to him through the union grapevine that there was a contract out on his life . So , for the last 20 months , Dumas has lived the life of the hunted . He has a shotgun at hand at all times and has told his wife not to let their three children out of sight . How did he get into this fix ? By being a man who stands in the way of organized crime 's efforts to extend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dumas has refused bribes to corral union members into shady insurance schemes and , more dramatically , has been a roadblock in the path of a New York City gangster invasion of the Miami International Airport . Through control of Teamster Local 295 , the New York Mafia already oversees the handling of freight at John F. Kennedy International Airport . This has enabled it to tap two huge rivers of tribute . One , according to Congressional testimony , is through a gangster-dominated trucking association which truckers must join in order to do business at the airport ? and which employs mobster " labor consultants "  | to assure labor peace . The other consists of organized pillage of air cargoes which , according to New York Waterfront Commission estimates , has reached the awesome total of $10 million annually . For the last several months , Dumas has been fighting Mafia raids from New York aimed at capturing members of his union ? and , with them , control of all trucks bringing air freight in and out of the Miami airport . Two Bosses . Dumas ' struggle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a larger struggle at the top ? between former president James R. Hoffa and his successor , Frank E. Fitzsimmons . Many Teamster locals are honestly run by dedicated union leaders . But because of the struggle above , the underworld 's parasitic hold on the Teamsters is as pervasive today as it was when Senate investigators and the press exposed it 15 years ago . To understand why , it is necessary to recognize a basic fact of political life in the Teamsters . Its president must satisfy two constituencies : union members and the organized-crime bosses of our big cities . This obligation was created by Hoffa when he enlisted underworld support in his drive for delegates to the 1956 Teamster convention . Elected president , Hoffa found himself with two masters . He worked 18-hour days for his union members , settling grievances , building Teamster membership over the two million mark , and negotiating ever-higher pay increases and fringe benefits . He did well for his underworld constituency , too , paying off in other people 's money and misery . He permitted gangsters to turn Kennedy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sluiced Teamster welfare-fund insurance patronage to a criminal family linked to the old Capone mob . All over the country , Hoffa paid debts to organized-crime figures with Teamster pension-fund loans that often went unpaid . Today , the underworld holds the power balance that may determine who will be elected Teamster president in 1976 : Hoffa ( providing he wins his legal battle against restraints that bar him from union activity ) or the incumbent Fitzsimmons . " Without support from the boys , ' " a Teamster vice president told me , " Fitz could n't remain president for one minute . " So Fitzsimmons , as Hoffa before him , must also please " the boys " as well as the members . Best Girl . When Hoffa went to jail in 1967 for fraudulent use of the Teamsters ' biggest pension fund , and for jury tampering , he assigned Fitzsimmons to act on his behalf . 1974 THE MAFIA TIGHTENS ITS GRIP ON THE TEAMSTERS ror  | control of the entire membership at the 1976 Teamster convention . Blocking Action . At Hoffa 's elegant condominium @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found himself in the classic posture of the man . to whom a best friend has entrusted a best girl . He fell in love with the girl ? the Teamster presidency ? and moved aggressively to keep her . For Fitzsimmons , a phlegmatic , pumpkin-faced 66-year-old with a heavy belly , the girl had many attractions . First , there was the handsome dowry , a $125,000 yearly salary . Then there were three homes to live in ? one in California , one in Florida and another in Washington ? and a $3.5 million jet plane that would carry him anywhere in the world , all expenses paid . To this , finally , was added the courtship of the President of the United States . Seeking labor support , President Nixon met with Fitzsimmons ' executive board in the summer of 1971 , rubbed elbows with mobconnected officials , and let it be known that the White House door was always open to Fitzsimmons . As the time approached for Hoffa to leave prison , Fitzsimmons decided that his own ruddy face ? basking in the favor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than Hoffa 's prison pallor . But if Hoffa , freed , were to resume union activity , his first move would be a run for the presidency of his old Local 299 in Detroit . With that as a power base , he might well regain Bolch the pardon form he signed in prison . It contained stipulations such as , " the parolee will not drink to excess " ? but no stipulation that Hoffa refrain from union activity . Hoffa said he was astounded to learn on emerging from prison that another pardon document , signed by President Nixon , barred him from union activity until March 6 , 1980 ? four years beyond the next Teamster presidential election . Who was responsible ? " Fitzsimmons , " says Hoffa ? with assists from inside the White House . " Colson Charles W. Colson , exPresidential counsel , who has pleaded guilty to obstruction of justice in the Ellsberg case was the mastermind , " Hoffa added , and part of the payoff was Teamster legal business for Colson 's law firm ? at a reported $100,000-a-year fee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the Justice Department , aimed at removing his union-activity restrictions . Meanwhile , Fitzsimmons is using his power and patronage to woo his two constituencies : the union and the big-city hoodlums . As Hoffa spelled it out to us , Fitzsimmons builds support within the union by returning to the regional Teamster barons the power Hoffa had taken from them . Teamster organizing money , some $7 million yearly , is going to Fitzsimmons men only . And he is banishing Hoffa loyalists to areas where they ca n't influence delegates to the 1976 Teamster convention . Recently , Fitzsimmons  | abolished the $46,000-a-year union job filled by Hoffa 's wife . As for the underworld : Teamster business patronage has lately had a curious way of turning up in unclean hands . For example , when Fitzsimmons approved a $1.3 million public-relations program last year to burnish the Teamster image , part of this cash flowed to two " image improvers " with criminal records , one of whom had served 20 years on a murder charge . And Fitzsimmons became attentive to underworld get-rich-quick schemes at Teamster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York underworld figure and pushed by Fitzsimmons ' son , Don . Fitzsimmons and Son . The underworld figure was Louis C. Ostrer , who had pleaded guilty in 1969 to swindling a Canadian insurance company of $338,000 , and received a five-year suspended sentence . While on probation , Ostrer was convicted on a federal stock-swindling charge in company with the notorious " Johnny Dio " Dioguardi ? thus linking him to the New York Mafia ; a New York County indictment further linked him to Mafia loan sharks and charged he had discussed the prospective killing of a delinquent borrower . Ostrer conceived a union-insurance scheme whose rich potential as a ripoff was dramatized by the form it took in one union Ostrer sold it to : New York Teamster Local 295 , dominated by labor racketeer Harry Davidoff . Under the Ostrer plan , trucking employers paid $40 a week per employe to buy individual insurance policies for union members and to build a severance-pay fund . Employers had to go along with the scheme or suffer Davidoff reprisals . As the New York State Insurance Department has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by excessive commissions and administration fees ; for example , insurance which cost the severance fund $1,238,274 could have cost but $52,546 . Thus the fund was depleted by $1,185,000 . Since the money was paid by employers in lieu of wage increases , it was actually coming out of employes ' pockets . Ostrer initially sold his scheme to some dozen Teamster locals in New York City and New Jersey . Then he extended his operation to Detroit , where , in 1972 , he hired young Don Fitzsimmons as " consultant and public-relations man . " Since Don Fitzsimmons had no insurance experience ( he had been selling vending machines for a hoodlum-owned company ) , I asked Ostrer why . " I hired him as a conduit , " Ostrer said , " in order to meet certain people . " One of the " certain people " Ostrer met was the " conduit 's " father , Frank Fitzsimmons . " Frank quickly saw the value of my plan , " Ostrer recalled , " and told me I could go out and sell it to Teamster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the story . " I was looking for some- thing lucrative , " he told us . So , with Ostrer 's plan in hand , young Fitzsimmons said , he solicited unions in Michigan , California , Nevada , Massachusetts , New Jersey and Illinois . He estimated that some 6o to 7o locals in those states and Florida eventually adopted Ostrer 's plan . Two things , however , crimped Ostrer 's operation . In New York , the State Department of Insurance put a five-percent commission ceiling on insurance sold in bulk to employes , and threatened to force trustees to make restitution of drained funds . Elsewhere , local union leaders decided that Ostrer 's scheme was too good a thing to share with the originator . Detroit Local 299 , for example , booted him out and turned over the fund to the local 's lawyer , who subsequently fired young Fitzsimmons . So Ostrer 's scheme goes marching on ? in other hands . Meanwhile , it is persistently reported inside the Teamsters that Frank Fitzsimmons will seek approval of a severancefringe-benefit plan at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay , of course , is a legitimate union bargaining demand , and some unions have been operating severance funds honestly for years , usually under the administration of an insurance company or actuarial consultant firm . But since many Teamster locals administer welfare funds themselves , one can imagine the opportunities for crooked leaders and the mobs if severance funds become general for all Teamster trucking employes . Rivers of Cash . As these short , selected examples of underworld enterprise show , brains within organized crime are forever buzzing with schemes to tap the vast rivers of cash that employers pour out yearly to provide benefits for Teamster members . The biggest river of all is the $200 million that employers of some 430,000 Teamsters channel each year into the Central States , Southeast and Southwest Area Pension Fund . This has created a $tbillion reservoir of lending and investing money ? putting it , as a lending institution , among the country 's too biggest banks . As a Teamster vice president told me , the big-city mobs ' chief interest in the Teamsters lies in loans from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recent attempted assassination of the man who dictated loans at the time , the Chicago gang 's ambassador to the Teamsters , Allen Dorfman . Inside the Teamsters , the word was that the Eastern mob was angry at not getting its share of the action . What does all this say about the underworld 's " interest in the Teamsters " ? How has it fared during the Fitzsimmons reign ? Very well , thank you . In fact , Mafia raids on union gold have become more brazen than ever . @#
