THE THREE SISTERS by ANTON CHEKHOV <P> Chekhov is the poet laureate of the commonplace . He once wrote that " on the stage everything should be as complex and as simple as in life . People are having dinner , and while they 're having it , their future happiness may be decided or their lives may be shattered . " In presenting vivid , selective glimpses of ordinary life , Chekhov simultaneously plumbs the nature of existence with its brevity , hope , joy and sorrow . He is an impressionist rather than a photographer . In his plays we know that virtually nothing has happened , but we feel that much has been said . <P> Certainly nothing much happens in the Russian provincial military outpost where the three sisters are exiled psychologically as well as physically from their dear beloved Moscow . Boredom , drunkenness , mean gossip and despair are the town 's leading resources , and the sisters drown in anguish . <P> They try to exorcise loneliness by seeking some point or purpose in their lives .

Miserable in her marriage to a pedantic schoolmaster ( Rex Robbins ) , Masha ( Ellen Burstyn ) stumbles into a hopeless , heart-wrenching affair with the garrison 's Lieut . Colonel Vershinin ( Denholm Elliott ) . The youngest sister , Irina ( Tovah Feldshuh ) , seeks to be ennobled by the " dignity of work " in the local telegraph office . <P> Olga and Masha urge Irina to accept a proposal of marriage from an oddly self-mocking anti-hero named Baron Tusenbach ( Austin Pendleton ) . Though Irina does not love him , she does deeply respect him and reluctantly agrees . But Irina is besieged by another suitor , a man as menacing as a bayonet thrust , Staff Captain Solyony ( Rene Au-berjonois ) , who is romantically desperate for her love . Solyony challenges the baron to a duel , and all dreams end with a pistol shot . <P> Following this exemplary production , the Brooklyn Academy of Music Theater Company ought to be held to gether as a permanent repertory troupe .

Tovah Feldshuh is a steel butterfly , a young actress of electrifying presence and promise . As Masha , Ellen Burstyn lacks some consuming sensual hunger , but her parting embrace with Vershinin is a silent , agonized howl of lost love . <P> The astonishingly versatile English director Frank Dunlop has maintained an admirably sane balance between the ironic lightness of Chekhov 's comedy and the Stygian strain of his pathos . For the subtlest of comic relief , Dunlop could not have wished for anything better than that provided by Barnard Hughes as a compassionate , sodden and cheerily nihilistic regimental doctor . In serving Chekhov with unswerving fidelity , BAM adds another medal of honor to its growing collection . <P> T.E . Kalem
