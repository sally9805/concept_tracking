txt Senator Birch Bayh said today that President Nixon was wrong in charging that Senate opponents of G. Harrold Carswell 's nomination to the Supreme Court were overstepping their wooer constitutional role . The Indiana Democrat said that Mr. Nixon was " wrong as a matter of constitutional law , wrong as a matter of history and wrong as a matter of public policy . " He supported his argument in a floor speech analyzing the Senate 's historical role in the appointment of Supreme Court justices . Mr. Nixon 's view of the Senate 's powers also drew criticism from the Senate majority leader , Mike Mansfield of Montana ; Senator George S. , South Dakota Democrat , and even from one member of President Nixon 's own party ? Jacob K. Javits of New York . The attacks dominated the day 's speeches , while off the Senate floor sentiment appeared to be hardening against the motion to recommit the nomination to the Judiciary Committee . A survey today by The New York Times showed that 44 Senators were expected to vote to recommit the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Four of the Senate 's 100 members are expected to be absent , so 96 are expected to vote . This would mean that 49 votes would be needed to send the nomination back . Thus Judge Carswell 's opponents apparently must win the votes of five of the seven uncommitted Senators to recommit the nomination . Mr. Nixon asserted in a letter made public yesterday that the traditional powers of the Presidency might be jeopardized if the Senate " attempts to substitute its judgment " for his . He also suggested that the opposition to his nominees was denying him the same free choice that other Presidents had enjoyed . The letter was sent to Senator William B. Saxbe , Republican of Ohio . Votes Seen Unchanged A few of the uncommitted Senators grumbled privately about the President 's position , but there was no indication that the letter had swayed any Senator 's vote . Mr. Bayh focused his criticism on Mr. Nixon 's contention that " it is the duty of the President to appoint and of the Senate to advise and consent . " At three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authority as the power to " appoint . " The Senator quoted Article II , Section 2 of the Constitution , which provides that the President " shall nominate , and by and with the consent of the Senate shall appoint " Supreme Court members . He contended that the Constitution provides for the appointive ' power to be shared between the President and the Senate . Mr. Bayh also disputed Mr. Nixon 's assertion that other Presidents had been given more freedom of choice by the Senate . One out of four high court nominees failed in the 19th century , the Senator said . He added that of President Johnson 's four nominations , two failed ? including the one for the vacancy that Mr. Nixon is seeking to fill . Senator Bavh concluded that the Senate has a constitutional ' duty to conduct " a full-scale review of the qualifications " of each nominee . On this basis , he said , Judge Carswell should be rejected as lacking in legal competence and judicial competence . The Decision-Makers Today 's survey indicated that to carry the recommittal motion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Senators : Quentin N. Burdick of North Dakota , Albert Gore of Tennessee , Ernest F. Hollings of South Carolina and Ralph W. Yarbrough of Texas , all Democrats ; and J. Caleb Boggs of Delaware , Len B. Jordan of Idaho and Margaret Chase ' Smith of Maine , Republicans . This count could be changed slightly if one of the two Senators who are expected to miss the vote on Monday because of illness are able to " pair " with someone who would otherwise vote on the opposite side of the question . When votes are " paired " both Senators abstain . Senator Clinton P. Anderson , Democrat of New Mexico , and Senator Karl E. Mundt , South Dakota Republican , are expected to miss the vote because of illness , according to aides . Senator Anderson is considered opposed to Judge Carswell and Senator Mundt is thought to be a supporter of the nomination . Two Senators on opposite sides of the issue will be away at a conference in the Far East and thus will cancel out each other 's position . They are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ F. Bennett . Republican of Utah .
