Barker , a Miami real estate operator , later turned out to have possessed ? funds that were traced as contributions to the re-election committee . Another of the five , James W. McCord Jr. , was a security coordinator for the committee . Specifically , the General Accounting Office report listed these apparent violations : ( ) The committee 's failure to keep detailed and exact account of a $25,000 contribution made to the Republicans by a Minnesota businessman , Dwayne 0 . Andreas , through Kenneth H. Dahlberg , chairman of the Minnesota re-election committee . The report said that the Republicans said the contribution was made prior to April 7 , the effective date of the campaign act making disclosure of contributions mandatory .

More ' Possible Violations ' In addition to these " apparent-violations , " . Phillip A.

Some reports have also alleged that the men ? were also in the process of removing bugging devices already installed when they were apprehended shortly after midnight on June .17 .

Those bills were traced to a Miami bank and it was subsequently learned that Mr. Barker had deposited in the bank the $25,000 " Dahlberg check " and the four " Mexican " checks worth $89,000 . The General Accounting Office report said that because the campaign act did not give it the right to subpoena witnesses or , records , and because of the grand jury investigation in progress , it was " impossible to close certain gaps in the information we have been able to obtain . " " Our auditors have been able to obtain very little information on transactions prior to April 7 , 1972 , the effective date of the , act , " it said . " Also , some individuals who may have knowledge of ' the matter involved have not been available to discuss the subject with us . Others ? were not available to uz. - until late in the audit : for instance , Hugh W. Sloan Jr. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aug. 23 . " Representative Wright Patman , Democrat of Texas , whose Committee on Banking and Currency is also looking into the issues involved , said this afternoon that the report " can be considered as nothing more than chapter one of what must be a top-to-bottom investigation of all the allegations involved in the Watergate incident and the closely related areas ' of political fund raising . " Mr. Patman , who had earlier complained abolit , the delay ? in the release of the report , indicated his unhappiness with the Justice Department 's being brought into the case by the G.A , O. " We are now faced with another dilemma , " he said . " We are asking Richard Kleindienst , a strongly partisan Attorney General , to prosecute wrong . doings of the political party , which boosted him to such a high place . in government . " He suggested the appointment by the courts of a appointment prosecuting team . " On another matter , . Mr. Patman said he was : " deeply ; disturbed " by press reports this morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dahlberg , was one of a group of Minneapolis investors who were granted a Federal bank charter oil Wednesday in a Minneapolis suburb , He said he had asked the Controller of the Currency for information on the ' cage . O'Brien Unhappy Lawrence F. O'Brien , Mr. 's national campaign chairman , also expressed displeasure at the Justice Department 's being asked to play a role in the investigation . He said : " I continue to be pessimistic about the likelihood of . a fair , thorough and speedy investigation of the G.A.O . allegations , for on Attorney General Kleindienst 's calendar , it appeared that nothing will - be permitted to happen before Election Day . " The G.A.O . report was divided into three basic headings under the section " findings and conclusions . " The following are summaries of those sections : ' THE $25,000 DAHLBERG CHECK ' Mr. Dahlberg told the G.A.O . ' that he got a phone call on April 5 from a man who wanted to remain anonymous ? later identified as Mr. Andreas ? who said he wanted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ campaign . He said that Mr. Andreas specifically stated that he wanted to remain anonymous and that was why he was making the gift on April 5 ? two days before the campaign act went into effect , requiring disclosure . Maurice H. Stans , chairman of the finance committee , was told about this on April 5 , Mr. Dahlberg said . Mr. Dahlberg agreed to pick up ' the cash that weekend in the Miami area . He told the G.A.O . that Mr. Andreas had said he was placing the money in the custody of a third party in a Miami area hotel . William Norman , an employe of Mr. Dahlberg 's company and treasurer of the Minnesota committee , confirmed Mr. Dahlberg 's story . Mr. Dahlberg told the accounting office that after arriving in Miami he picked up the money on April 9 and , for security , had a cashier 's check made out to himself on April 10 at the First Bank and Trust Company of Boca Raton . On April 11 Mr. Dahlberg flew to Washington , endorsed the check and personally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promptly gave it to Mr. Sloan , ' the committee 's treasurer . Mr. Sloan said that either the same day or the following day he conferred with G. Gordon Liddy , then counsel - for the committee , who advised that the check was a pre-April ' 7 contribution and suggested that it be turned back into cash . Mr. Sloan said he gave the check to Mr. Liddy to do this . Mr. Stans 's affidavit says that he was told this several weeks later by Mr. Sloan . The G.A.O . said that it had no ' proof of this , but . bank records show that it was credited on April 20 to " Barker Associates , Inc. , Trust Account " in the Republic National Bank of Miami . Mr. Sloan said that Mr. Liddy did return currency to him but not until the middle of May and not in the exact amount . Mr. Liddy has refused to talk to , the G.A.O . investigators , the report said . In a later interview , Mr. Dahlberg told the agency that the donor , was Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 9 on a golf course in the Miami area . There was no explanation for the ? inconsistency in Mr. Dahlberg 's story . ' The G.A.O . said the Republicans , in a memorandum dated yesterday , said the contribution was completed on April 5 when the cash was placed in the hotel safe deposit box . . " Based on the facts stated above , " the G.A.O . said , " we have concluded that the donor retained control over the cbntribution until . April 9 , 1972 , when he delivered ' the .. cash to Mr. Dahlberg as agent for the committee . Therefore the $25 , - 000 contribution was pot completed until after the effective date of the act . " ' FOUR CHECKS TOTALING $89,000 ' The , accounting office said that four bank checks : drawn on the Banco Internacional of Mexico City to the order ' of Manuel Ogarrio , in the amounts of $15,000 , $18,000 , $24,000 and $32,000 , were deposited in the Barker Associates bank account on the same day as the Dahlberg check . " Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were pre-April 7 contributions from donors in Texas ' who wished to remain anonymous , and therefore would not reveal their name 's , " the report said . Mr. Sloan told the office that the four checks were delivered ' to him by an agent for the donors on April 5 , and because he was unsure of their negotiability he gave them to Mr. Liddy and that Mr. Liddy said he : would cash them . Mr. Sloan I said that Mr. Liddy did not deliver the cash to him Until the middle of May . Further ; Mr. Sloan- said that the total given him by Mr. Liddy was significantly less ' than the combined total . of $11.4,000 ? made up of the $25,000 and $89,000 amounts . Reconverting Checks - " Mr. Sloan was unable to recall the amount of the difference although he thought it was ' about $2,500 , " the G.A.O . said . Mr. Sloan said that Mr. Liddy ' said the shortage was related to " reconverting the checks to cash . " Republican officials have said that Mr. Liddy was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for refusing to speak Ito agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation about the case . ' THE $350,000 BANK ' DEPOSIT OF MAY 25 ' ? The G.A.O . said that the cash proceeds - of the $25,000 check and those from-the $89,000 total were included in a bank deposit of $350,000 in. cash made on May 25 to ' the Media Committee to Re-elect ' the President . Mr. Sloan ? said : ' he ' and Mr. Liddy made the deposit , and the G.A.O . confirmed this with a duplicate deposit slip that had this notation : . . " Cash on hand prior to , 1/7/72. from 1968. campaign per Hugh Sloan . " ? Paul t-Barrick , then controller and now - treasurer of the committee , told the G.A.O . that he made the notation when Mr. ? Sloan gave him the deposit slip . Mr. Barrick added that he had not previously . been aware of the $350,000 ' fund , the report ' said .. Mr. Sloan resigned recently from the committee for " personal reasons " unconnected with the affair . Mr. Sloan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $350,000 was kept in a safe in Mr. Stans 's secretary 's office and that only lie and Mr. Stans had access to it . Under the act , any person ' who violates any provision of Title III may be fined not more than $1,000 or imprisoned for not - more ? than one year or both .
