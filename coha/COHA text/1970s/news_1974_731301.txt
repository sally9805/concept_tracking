txt Shea stadium . Two hours before the Yankees ' game with the Cleveland Indians . In their locker room , the Yankees wait . A few calmly play cards . The rookies nervously get dressed . The door opens and suddenly everybody smiles . " Hey , look who 's here ! Sy Berger ! Where 's the gum , Sy ? " " NO MORE GUM ! ' Cause guys like you screwed it up for everybody ? " " Whaddaya mean I screwed it up ? I chewed it . " " NO MORE GUM ! We spent $10,000 giving the clubs free gum last year . Now sign this five times . The kids want to see your autograph . " Everybody has a minute ' for Sy Berger , but Sy Berger has more than a minute for them . He has air conditioners . He has stereos . He has money . These are the annual payments and royalties every major league player receives for appearing on the product Sy represents  --  baseball cards . " IF WE 'RE MAKING money , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chewing Gum , Inc. , for which Sy works as sports director , is making lots and lots of money . Last year the company sold 250 Card Nu . 70 in the Topps " lineup  --  he 's one of Sy Berger 's friends . million baseball cards in packs of eight for a dime , or of 42 for 39 cents . Most sales are in the United States , but Topps also sells the cards in Canada , Puerto Rico , and Central America . For each player the cut is generally $400 annually , a $250 yearly payment plus royalties . Some , like Gaylord Perry of the Cleveland Indians , let the money accumulate and then ask Sy to send them some expensive item from the Topps catalog . For Perry it was a TV-tape-stereo complex . Detroit Tiger Al . Kaline used his money to buy a lawn tractor . For Topps , whose officials do n't give financial breakdowns , the cards mean millions in sales , a far cry front 1951 , when Berger , then a baseball fan involved in company promotion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BASEBALL CARDS were new for the chewing gum company , they were not new to America , dating back to the 1800s , when they were included in cigaret packages . In fact , the most valuable card of all time is the Honus Wagner card of 1909 . Wagner was a nonsmoking Pittsburgh Pirate shortstop who discovered that a cigaret company had included his card in its pack . He protested . Those cards which could be withdrawn were , and those that could n't are today worth $1,500 , a record which Hank Aaron probably wo n't beat . Berger says that card value is determined by rarity , and Topps has six Aaron cards in this year 's lineup . It was Berger who thought of including baseball statistics on baseball cards , and to increase them to their present size . Berger also hired professional scout " Turk " Karam to get minor league players to sign options with Topps for cards if they made the majors . Berger has many friends on the teams . " Here I am with Dick Allen , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is located in the Bush Terminal section of I Brooklyn , a waterfront area of foghorns , cobblestone streets , and whitewashed warehouses . " I know I have a picture of Ron Santo ' around here , " he mumbled , rummaging thru his desk . " Where is it ? They just fixed up the office and everything is off the walls . He 's like a son to me . This is very disappointing . Here I am with Stan Musial . Where 's Ronnie ? This is breaking my heart . " " FOR SOMEONE OUTSIDE the world of baseball , he 's probably as good friends with us as anybody , " says Yankee pitcher Mel Stottlemyre . " I felt great the first time I saw my picture on a baseball card , " says Jack Brohamer , Cleveland Indian second baseman . When Topps began baseball card sales , Sy compiled the statistics and wrote the blurbs for each player , as well as doing the baseball quizzes . " SUPPOSE YOU HAD a situation where someone is n't doing so well in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supposed to say , the guy stinks ? No . You figure if a guy got into the majors , he had to do something good . Write about that . " Today Topps has its own sportswriter , three full time photographers , and four persons to sign up players and make sure everybody 's happy . But despite careful preparations , mistakes still occur . There was the time Milwaukee Brave pitcher Warren Spahn convinced fellow pitcher and right hander Lou Burdett to pose as a southpaw . " We did n't catch it , " says Sy . " As soon as it hit the market we started getting calls and letters . ' YOU MADE A MISTAKE ! YOU MADE A MISTAKE ! ' The kids are pretty sharp . " Topps officials , who say they are in " the children 's entertainment business , " have not confined their products to baseball cards . Their biggest success is Bazooka bubble gum , the pink stuff you stepped on yesterday outside your home . Other successes include Elvis Presley cards , Beatle cards , and President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a science fiction card series entitled " Mars Attacks . " But the most phenomenal recent success at Topps , Wacky Packs , has resulted in the sacking of candy store counters around the country by 6-to 12-year-olds . In parts of New York , sore owners have separate cash registers just to handle Wacky Package sales . The Topps plant in Duryea , Penn. , has been unable to handle the millions of Wacky orders . THE WACKY PACKS CONsist of three Wacky stickers and a piece of gum for a nickel . The illustrations are of products familiar to the kids , but the words on the products are new . For instance : Sailem Cigarettes " Better to Sail ' em then to smoke ' em " ; Rice A Phoni " Last forever . . . It can be used over and over againl ; Neverready Assaulted Battery , and Ditch Masters Cigars . To Sy Berger , however , there is no comparison between Wacky . Packs and baseball cards . " Baseball cards are a stable item , " he says . " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increase this year . " OUTSIDE , THE BIG SHEA Stadium organ is grinding out a warmup tune . Most of the Yankees are out on the field , jogging or throwing balls . The Cleveland Indians are running out of their dugout . And back inside the locker room Sy Berger shoves a piece of paper in front of a late player . " Sign this five times , " he says . " The kids want your autograph . " A cassette tape recorder is playing jazz , and Sy Berger , feeling fine , is bouncing up and down . Everything looks great .
