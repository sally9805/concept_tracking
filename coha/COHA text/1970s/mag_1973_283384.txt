In his annual state of the environment report , President Nixon last week was almost rhapsodic : " I can report that we are well on our way to winning the war against environmental degradation , well on the way to making our peace with nature . " While some progress has been made , the nation 's battle for ecological health has hardly been won , as the multitude of proposals put forth by Nixon himself proved . <P> All told , Nixon cited 27 proposals , including 19 bills left unpassed by Congress last year , which he said needed to be enacted . They would affect almost every area of the nation 's environment . His highest priority , said Nixon , was to promote " more effective and sensible use of our land . " The President therefore exhorted Congress to heed a bill that would make states take an inventory of their most ecologically valuable land ( coastal zones , estuaries , flood plains ) and identify areas that might be harmed by building power plants , highways or airports . The penalty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ federal funds for highway and airport projects until the states act . <P> Other Nixon bills would : <P> &gt; Use the Highway Trust Fund , which now finances only highway construction , to provide money for new mass transit systems . <P> &gt; Protect coastal wetlands , which are the nursery of most ( 80% ) marine life . <P> &gt; Set national standards to ensure the purity of drinking water . <P> &gt; Prevent disposal of " extremely hazardous wastes " on land . <P> &gt; Provide $20 million to expand the nation 's system of wild and scenic rivers . <P> &gt; Tax industries according to the amounts of sulfur dioxides they discharge into the air . <P> &gt; Create more wilderness areas in the Eastern U.S. so that the " majority of our people are to have the full benefit of our natural glories . " <P> There is little in Nixon 's message to arouse heated opposition . As in the past , the real question is whether the Administration 's performance will match its rhetoric . Critics maintain that the White House has often failed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bills . Whatever the fate of his legislative package , Nixon made it clear that he is determined to tackle two key issues . " The costs of pollution , " he stated , " should be met more fully in the free marketplace , not in the federal budget " - meaning that cleanup costs will be reflected in higher prices for goods and services . As to the dilemma involving the exploitation and use of energy resources , which are needed in today 's society but account for most of the nation 's environmental problems , the President vowed to treat the subject fully in a later special message to Congress .
