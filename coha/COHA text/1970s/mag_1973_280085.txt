AT first , it seemed like a worthy and public-spirited idea . The Fredericksburg , Va. , realty office of Shannon &; Luchs set aside $2,200 and offered to pay 10 for each can found littering the local roadsides . Alas , the firm had underestimated the fervor of the environmental movement . Last week a parking lot adjacent to the realty office was buried under a mountain of cans , all put into plastic bags . Ten ft. high and 190 ft. in diameter , the pile contained 585,156 cans brought in before the offer expired and another 100,000 or so that came in after the deadline . <P> That left Shannon &; Luchs with two problems : 1 ) honoring the $3,651.56 worth of lOUs that were given out when the original $2,200 was exhausted , and 2 ) disposing of the cans . The realty company sought the help of local businessmen and collected $700 . The townspeople hope to meet the remaining deficit of nearly $3,000 by holding a big benefit dance or carnival later this month . To the disappointment of ardent environmentalists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ landfill ; earlier plans to recycle the aluminum containers had to be abandoned . Reason : insufficient manpower to separate them from the rest of Fredericksburg 's immense mountain of cans .
