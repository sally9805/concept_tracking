txt The worker looks like any other busy employe as he strides swiftly through the shadowy parking lot of a massive warehouse on this city 's West Side . Except for one thing : The bright violet hem of a woman 's dress hanging below his jacket . The worker is a thief . He steals from his employer , and he and his kind are giving American business a $4 billion headache . Employe theft has always been a problem for companies , but executives say that in recent years it has worsened . It is especially acute in consumer goods distribution and retailing , where large amounts of merchandise and sometimes cash pass through the hands of many workers . The thieves are most often those directly involved with the flow of goods  --  sales clerks , stockroom employes , drivers of delivery trucks , warehousemen , cashiers . But in a surprising number of cases such workers are in collusion with their own supervisors or higher executives . Few company officials like to talk about stealing by employes , but sources who know say it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " inventory shrinkage " ? an accounting euphemism for missing goods . Among many department stores and clothing retailers , such shortages have nearly doubled in recent years to 3% and sometimes 4% of sales . Who Devastates ' Whom ? " Maybe 90% of your employes have integrity , but the other 10% can devastate you , " says Sanford Edelman , vice president in charge of thwarting employe theft at E. J. Korvette , a New York-based discount chain . Just whom the thief devastates is open to question , however . Most companies write off " inventory shrinkage " as an operating expense and slap the cost onto the consumer in the form of higher prices . Thus , a store that finds its employes are stealing goods valued at 3% of annual sales may simply raise its prices 3% ? plus whatever more is necessary to cover the cost of attempts at theft prevention . Surprisingly , the rising theft on the part of employes is n't accompanied by a rising sophistication in the techniques of stealing . Most workers resort to tactics no more deft than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coat and sneaks them out to his car . " I 'd have to stop to think of anything really foxy , " says Korvette 's Mr. Edelman . " Most ( theft ) is pretty simple . " At a major Manhattan department store , sales clerks in the necktie department use several methods for stealing ties , according to a former employe . For women clerks , the simplest tactic is to stuff their purses with ties . Men stroll into restrooms , put the stolen tie on and wear it out of the store . Also , tie clerks may simply write each other " even-exchange " slips on ties they want to steal and then flash the slips at security guards when they leave the building openly carrying the stolen goods ; such slips are supposed to indicate a previous purchase has been returned and exchanged for a different item of the same price . Easy to Spot But if the thiefs lack cunning , so do some security men assigned to catch them . Bloomingdale 's , a big New York-area department store , uses its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Supposedly , clerks ca n't spot the store detectives . " But you get to know who they are , " says one ex-employe . " They dress like shoppers , but some of them are friends of the clerks and they 'll come up , lean on the counter and chat . Once , a man who looked like a customer went behind my counter and picked up the phone . When I tried to stop him , he said : ' Shhh  --  I 'm with protection . ' " Although some inside thieves are replenishing their own wardrobes or decorating their homes , many sell their loot . Helen C. , a price marker at a New York department store , recently confided to a fellow worker that she had stolen a $140 camera from the stockroom and offered to sell it to him for $50 . The employe paid her a deposit and agreed to meet her at a nearby bar to close the deal . Unfortunately for Helen , the buyer turned out to be an undercover investigator , and as she made her " sale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and told Helen she was fired . During the whole incident Helen remained unaware that the supposed " buyer " was a company investigator . So later that evening the man phoned her at home and asked for his money back . Not one to miss an opportunity , Helen invited him to her apartment , where she displayed five other cameras she had stolen from the store . Preserving his cover , the man declined to buy a camera , departed and later reported his findings to the store . The firm got the five cameras back , but It estimated that Helen had stolen and resold over $1,000 worth of merchandise before she was nabbed . Avoiding Publicity Most thieves steal in the assurance that if caught they will merely be fired , not prosecuted . Taking an employe to court for stealing creates what most companies consider bad publicity , and hauling one culprit after another before the bench and into the spotlight could do permanent damage , firms fear . " They 're afraid the average customer will take his business elsewhere if he finds out that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three cents is added to every dollar of price to pay for it , " says one management consultant . The warehouseman who steals dresses , for example , is being watched by his company , which wants to find out if he 's acting alone or in collusion with others ; as soon as that 's determined , he 'll be apprehended and fired . But company officials doubt they 'll prosecute . If an employe does n't want to risk dealing with a fellow worker to dispose of stolen goods , middlemen willing to buy his loot abound . Saul D. Astor , president of Management Safeguards Inc. , a private investigation firm , claims some bartenders in the central and shopping district of Manhattan specialize in purchasing stolen goods . The bartenders often sell the merchandise to small retailers . Investigators say uncovering employe theft is a relatively simple task . The real trick is to keep it under control once it 's discovered . Consider the large baking company whose 39 route drivers for years routinely slipped up to 4,000 loaves of bread a day to supermarket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problem existed  --  records of the drivers ' loads seldom matched up with store receipts  --  but it chose to look the other way and write off the shortages as an operating expense . But early this year things came to a head . Because prices were already rising , it became more difficult to tack the cost of the thievery on to the retail price of the bread . Just as distressing was the company 's inability to expand its routes ; drivers were too busy servicing their under-the-counter accounts to take on new legitimate customers . So the company began charging the drivers the full wholesale price , an average of 29 cents per loaf , for bread unaccounted for . The firm said it made the move to " remove indifference among the drivers and create a sense of responsibility . " What it created was a sense of ingenuity . Drivers countered by continuing their illicit sales and replacing bread so disposed of  --  with day-old bread purchased for 10 cents a loaf from the company 's own day-old bread store . The company was initially exuberant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than 20% in three months . Then it caught on , and began coding the bread wrappers , making substitution of day-old bread for missing loaves impossible . The toughest theft rings to crack are those involving supervisors or executives , investigators say . " I 'm not afraid Fred ( a boss ) will report me for stealing ; I 've seen him stealing many times , " a sales clerk at one New York store recently told an undercover detective . In a different department of the same store , two stockroom supervisors were found to be actually recruiting and paying underlings to steal for them . Norman Jaspan , head of a New York investigation firm , says of the $75 million in fraud uncovered by his men last year , well over half was perpetrated by supervisors and higher company officials . Store owners have found insurance policies against employe theft offer little comfort . Losses have soared so much in recent years that most firms can afford only high-deductible coverage . Underwriters say deductibles of $50,000 to $100,000 per theft are n't uncommon . Since few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Most recover less than 15% of their theft losses from insurance . When asked why employes steal so often and so much , most company officials echo the opinion of Sol W. Cantor , chairman of Interstate Department Stores , who blames " declining morality in American society . " Maybe so , investigators - say , but dishonesty is mostly a product of being offered the chance to be dishonest . Most companies , they contend , are robbed by employes because of sloppy supervision and a failure to enforce rules already laid down . Few firms , for example , give new employes the thorough screening that official policy usually calls for , say the consultants who are called in once employe theft begins to reach unmanageable proportions . Out of 14 employes who were recently fired from one discount store for thievery , eight strolled across the parking lot and got jobs in a supermarket in the same shopping center , says an executive of the discounter . To stop just that sort of thing , department stores in many cities have formed " mutual protective associations " in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bounced for theft and watch for these names when screening job applicants . Korvette 's parent corporation , Spartans Industries , has adopted this idea on a broader scale by forming a new subsidiary , Stores PreVent Inc . The operation keeps a computer " bank " of names , birth dates , Social Security numbers and other data on all former Spartans employes dismissed for stealing . The company offers the service to other firms nationwide and as ! . s them to submit similar information for tact computer on their own bad apples .
