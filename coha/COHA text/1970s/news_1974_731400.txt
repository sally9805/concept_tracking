txt THE REFERENDUM that approved the Regional Transportation Authority was held unconstitutional yesterday by a Circuit Court judge in Waukegan . Judge Henry Caldwell ruled that the words on the RTA ballot " were not sufficiently informativelo let voters know what they were voting on . " His ruling has the effect of preventing the RTA from spending any money or taking other official action unless the decision is overturned in the high court , Judge Caldwell said . He made the ruling in a suit brought by Jack Hoogasian , state 's attorney f or Lake County . ATTORNEYS FOR the RTA said they would appeal Judge Cakiwell 's decision directly to the Illinois Supreme Court . The March 19 referendum ballot asked voters to decide , " Should a Regional Transportation Authority be created for Cook , Du Page , Kane , Lake , , and Will Counties , Illinois ? " Voters in the six counties said yes to the proposition by a 12,979-vote margin . Attorneys for the RTA had argued that the Regional Transportation Authority Act specified the wording to be used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ required , according to James Munson , one of the attorneys . JUDGE CALDWELL said yesterday that he believed " the average voter did n't know what the RTA was . In my opinion the ballot was vague . " He said a recent Illinois Supreme Court opinion said that a proposal on a ballot must be a " fair portrayal of the chief features of the proposition in words of plain meaning . " Because it was too vague , Judge Caldwell said , the ballot violated the Illinois and United States Constitutions . BOTH SIDES of the lawsuit had earlier agreed that no money would be spent to implement the RTA Act until Judge Caldwell decided the constitutionality of the ballot . The RTA is scheduled to go into operation July 1 . Its board has met and elected Joseph Tecson temporary chairman . Officials at the Chicago Transit Authority , a big beneficiary of the RTA 's financing abilities , had no immediate comment . MEANWHILE , IN Spring . field , the House approved 123 to 10 a measure to provide non-RTA mass transit districts with $26 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ companion measure , 122 to 7 , to allocate $25 million to purchase transportation bonds to pay for mass transit equipment and facilities in areas outside the RTA.
