But it takes pleading and pressure-with more trouble ahead <P> Up rose the Senate 's silver-haired Majority Leader Robert Byrd , ready to address the crowded chamber . After three months ' tireless , tenacious work on behalf of the Panama Canal treaties , he was in a mood for Shakespearean rhetoric . " There is a tide in the affairs of men , which , taken at the flood , leads on to fortune , " he declared . " The Rubicon of decision on the treaties is now to be crossed . " <P> That crossing was successfully made last Thursday afternoon . With the Senate galleries packed with spectators and all 100 Senators in their seats , the clerk began calling out the names . In just ten minutes of voting , the first of the two treaties was narrowly approved , 68 to 32-one more vote than the required two-thirds . The treaty gives the U.S. the right to defend the canal 's neutrality after it is ceded to Panama by the year 2000 . The second treaty , to be voted on next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provide another jarring Senate battle . But in the moment of victory last week , a great noise welled up from the Senate floor as supporters of the treaty converged on their leaders to congratulate them on a job well done . <P> At Hamilton Jordan 's corner office in the White House , the mood was equally jubilant . As soon as they learned the outcome on TV , Jordan , National Security Adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski and Defense Secretary Harold Brown went to President Carter 's private study to share the good news . Later , Treaty Co-Negotiator Sol Linowitz arrived . Carter , who had been watching his own TV , was beaming more broadly than anyone could remember for a long time . The President got on the phone to praise his often criticized Capitol Hill man , Frank Moore , who was proclaimed the " real hero of this thing . " <P> Once the private celebration was over , Carter went to the White House press room to deliver a statement . " The people of the United States , " he said , " owe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Senate for their courageous action today in voting for the Panama Canal neutrality treaty . I am confident that the Senate will show the same courage and foresight when it considers the second treaty . This is a promising step toward a new era in our relationships with Panama and with all of Latin America . " He singled out Byrd , Senate Minority Leader Howard Baker , Gerald Ford and John Sparkman , chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations <P> Committee , for special praise . As he was leaving the press room , a reporter called out : " How does it feel to win one ? " Replied the President , smiling , " It feels good , I think . " <P> That was quite an understatement .
