When it comes to breaking new legal ground , the California Supreme Court is frequently a spadeful or two ahead of all others , including the U.S. Supreme Court . California 's ruling last August that local property taxes are an unfair method of financing public schools ( Serrano v. Priest ) has already been echoed by courts in Minnesota and Texas . Last week , in a 6-1 decision , the California court once again established an important precedent by extending the Miranda rule , which bars the use of confessions made by suspects who have been denied access to legal counsel . Police , said the court , must also stop questioning a minor once the youth asks to consult with a parent . <P> On Dec. 19 , 1968 , police found the bodies of an elderly couple , Joseph and Isabelle Diosdado , in the back room of their feed store in Compton , Calif . Each had been shot twice , and the cash register was empty . Eight weeks later , following up an informant 's tip , police officers arrested Bozzie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to talk to his father , an auto-plant inspector who was already at the station in search of his son , but the police refused . They did advise him , however , of his right to remain silent and to consult an attorney . In the course of the interrogation the boy admitted that he had killed the Diosdados . He was subsequently convicted and sentenced to a life term in prison . <P> Call for Help . In overturning the conviction , the state court ruled that denial of the youth 's request to see his father constituted a violation of his Fifth Amendment right to avoid incriminating himself . Writing for the court , Justice Raymond Sullivan said that it would be " fatuous " to expect an arrested minor to call an attorney . " It is unrealistic , " he added , " to attribute no significance to his call for help from the only person to whom he normally looks -a parent or guardian . " <P> The California decision , which reinforces the rights of suspected criminals , comes just when many observers have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . President Nixon 's four appointees to the Supreme Court are all expected to lean toward a tightening of criminal-law procedures . But the Los Angeles County district attorney 's office does not plan to seek review of the case by the " Nixon Court . " It promises to try Bozzie Bryant Burton III for murder again - without using his confession . And it is confident of a conviction . Which suggests that the California Supreme Court is not coddling criminals , but is simply requiring proper practices by the police .
