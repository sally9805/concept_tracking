For the ninth time since he acquired his California seashore spread , Richard Nixon last week was ensconced in his Western White House in San Clemente . For the President , San Clemente is more a change of scene than a change of pace . He still starts his office appointments at 8:30 a.m. , and it is often 6 p.m. before he can get away in his golf cart to the nearby villa . Cabinet ministers , aides , politicians and Republican candidates churn in and out of the small city ( pop . 17,000 ) as the business of state continues . Nixon 's changes of scene , of course , inevitably alter San Clemente 's own scene for both good and ill . To assess the changes , TIME Correspondents Simmons Fentress and Timothy Tyler collaborated on this report : <P> BEFORE Nixon 's arrival in 1969 , San Clemente was just another sleepy oasis on the luxuriant Southern California coast , a little-known haven for retired naval officers , wealthy businessmen and occasional refugees from smog-bound Los Angeles . Its most well-known citizen was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Red Rider " for his prodigious feats with the summons pad . Until his retirement three years ago , Patrolman Crego handed out more than 5,000 speeding tickets a year to motorists passing through town on El Camino Real highway , which links Los Angeles with San Diego . <P> Only Twice . Now , when Nixon is in town , San Clemente hums with the business of the most powerful nation on earth-and of the camp followers . Camera-laden tourists by the hundreds cruise the once-quiet , mimosa-lined boulevards in the hope of spotting the President . The San Clemente Inn provides maps of the quarter-mile route to the gates of the Western White House , but all the tourist gets is the gates ; a grove of palms hides Nixon 's offices and home . <P> " I doubt that there are 200 people in San Clemente who 've actually seen him , " says Mayor Walter Evans . " We never know he 's in town unless we 've been reading the papers , " adds W.E . Buckmaster , a longtime resident . Indeed , Nixon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when he and Bebe Rebozo were driving in the President 's white Continental , they stopped off at Taylor 's Pharmacy on Del Mar Avenue so that the Chief could buy a box of Russell Stover candy for Pat . Another time , the two dropped into the Bay Cities Ace Hardware Store , where Nixon bought three beach balls . <P> Awake Nights . San Clemente is doing its best to take a resident President in stride . " I personally think it 's kind of small-town hinky-dink , " says Mayor Evans of the big welcome banners that used to greet Nixon on arrival . Still . Nixon watching is a full-time occupation for many . Mrs. Doris Dennis , a San Clemente housewife , last year waited for two hours at Nixon 's helicopter pad in hopes of taking his picture , and was doubly rewarded when he shook her hand . " After that , I wrote Mr. and Mrs. Nixon , and I told them that they liven up the town , " Mrs. Dennis says . " Then they sent us an official picture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "
