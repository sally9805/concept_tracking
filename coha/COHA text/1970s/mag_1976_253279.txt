THE DUCHESS AND THE DIRTWATER FOX <P> Directed by MELVIN FRANK Screenplay by MELVIN FRANK , BARRY SANDLER and JACK ROSE <P> This winded frontier comedy concerns one of those fun couples who , sadly , amuse only each other . The Duchess ( Goldie Hawn ) is a Barbary Coast hooker trying to get off her back and onto her feet by turning a dishonest dollar . The Dirtwater Fox ( George Segal ) is a sharpie whose smart schemes always collapse in chaos . These two hook up to defraud a lubricious Mormon-a bit of bunko that helps keep the Dirtwater Fox a few steps ahead of some bad guys who are giving him heated chase . It seems that he made off with their loot from a bank job , only the Duchess swiped it from him , mixing it in by mistake with the baggage of her Mormon mark , who ... oh , well . Let it go at that . <P> If the plot is enervating to recount , it is excruciating to sit through . The script is replete with rough-and-tumble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ characters talk like unemployed gag writers trying to top each other over a delicatessen breakfast . Segal and Hawn , who are usually actors of charm and humor , here look as if they would like to be on the first stage out of town-or maybe even under it .
