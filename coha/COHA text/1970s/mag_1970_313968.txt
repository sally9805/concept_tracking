I do n't really have any interest in having any publicity in a national magazine . It 's not going to help me . It 's not going to help black people . It 's certainly not going to help Black World . I 've been alive a long time . Sure , things change and things have the appearance of change . But I do n't expect things to change from the white side , so I 'm working to change things from the black side . If you were n't black , I would n't talk with you . <P> The interviewer was TIME Correspondent Jacob Simms ; the speaker was Hoyt Fuller , managing editor of Black World magazine ; the subject was the black journalist 's distrust of a white world . " The black revolt , " Fuller says , " is as palpable in letters as it is in the streets . " Several small magazines ( among them Liberator , Freedomways ) are struggling to provide an outlet for the resulting explosions of prose and poetry . Fuller 's Black World @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circulation : more than 69,000 ) . <P> White Identity . Perhaps because of its pocket-magazine size , Black World conveys a sense of compressed passion . Its articles , fiction and poetry seethe with resentment , with desire for identity , with rejection of the subhumanity of the ghetto . A short story in the August issue gives a chilling description of a group of neighborhood children watching and wisecracking as the mother of one of them makes it with her lover of the moment . There are occasional " how to " articles-how to establish a distinctively black system of education , how to develop a " black aesthetic " - but mainly the tone is exhortatory , an urging that blacks throw off white shackles of the mind . <P> Black World 's villains are white-but not the predictable woolhats and rednecks . The real enemies are white liberals , whose good intentions tend to dull the edge of black rebellion , and members of the black middle class . Says Fuller : " My experience with middle-class blacks has been that all their efforts have been directed toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not helping the black community to survive . " <P> The theme is one that Fuller can not get out of his mind and his life . His small office overlooking Chicago 's South Michigan Avenue is cluttered with books and manuscripts by blacks . He appears to belie his radical mission . His sense of humor is close to the surface ; he smiles and manages to needle outsiders without offending them . <P> In turning on the black middle class , Fuller , now 42 , is turning on himself . Brought up in a middle-class black neighborhood in Detroit , he seemed well on his way to predictable success . He studied literature at Wayne State University ( B.A. ) and at the University of Florence . But , as he traveled through Europe and Africa , he began to believe that his middle-class values " support the system under which blacks are degraded and oppressed . " He worked briefly in New York for Collier 's Encyclopedia , then took an editorial job with Ebony magazine .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
