From the rubble of a violent semester came themes for commencement speakers across the U.S. Most dwelt on factionalized America and the need for reconciliation between young and old , black and white , left and right . New York City Mayor John V. Lindsay echoed the predominant plea by calling for a " new center " in the country 's politics . Speaking at Williams College in Massachusetts , he rejected rigid " attachment to the simple and the absolute . " Lindsay espoused " not a compromise between the uncompromising extremes , not a compromise with our conscience , but a commitment to rational change by rational means . " He added : " The revolutionary defiles the flag and the reactionary deifies it . Both offend reason and common sense . " <P> The Big Lie . In the eyes of Harvard President Nathan M. Pusey , however , the revolutionary is the bigger offender . In a moving baccalaureate address , which evoked his personal agony in coping with Harvard 's turmoils , he blamed campus disruption on faculty and student extremists " who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maligned and even shut down . " In Pusey 's angry view , such agitators-specifically , the S.D.S.-use techniques akin to those of the late Senator Joseph McCarthy , for whom Pusey served as a favorite target . He cited the Hitlerian tactic of " the big lie " - in this case , the radicals ' claim " that the university is a hopelessly bigoted , reactionary force in our society which serves the interest of a hideous military-industrial complex . " <P> Among the results , Pusey said , were the S.D.S.-inspired furor over the presence on campus of a Dow Chemical recruiter in 1967 and this year 's insinuations that Harvard 's Center for International Affairs is engaged in " complicity with our nefarious Government . " It is clear , he said , that " the old McCarthy technique is at work again , but this time-it is a sorrow to have to acknowledge it-by our own , and in our midst . " Pusey urged his graduates to " refuse to succumb to cynicism or hopelessness . It is a long way around , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only way for those who have come truly to understand the role of humane learning . " <P> " I may put it this way , " Pusey concluded . " There is a world of reason , modesty , charity and trust in the midst of , and opposed to , the oppressive and contentious world of deceit , anger , vilification and self-righteousness now made so manifest all about us again , as 20 years ago , by would-be exploiters . This former world is created and precariously maintained in all generations by civilized men , a world for which in the depths of our hearts I am sure we all yearn . What I have wanted to say to you today is simply that , in my view , as Harvard men you are called to serve that world . "
