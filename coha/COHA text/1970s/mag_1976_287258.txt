The top five theological libraries in the U.S. have for decades been within a day 's journey of one another-at Harvard , Yale , Princeton , Manhattan 's Union Theological Seminary and Connecticut 's Hartford Seminary Foundation . More recently Berkeley 's Graduate Theological Union and the Chicago Divinity School have been correcting the imbalance in the West , but there has been no collection below the Mason-Dixon line to match the luster of those in the Northeast . Now that has changed . Last week the final shipment of some 220,000 volumes-nearly 4% shelf miles of books-from Hartford 's superb collection went South , bound for the library of Candler School of Theology , part of Emory University in Atlanta . Added to Candler 's own library of some 117,000 books of more recent vintage , the Hartford collection makes Candler 's one of the nation 's best . <P> Emory University paid $1,750,000 for the collection , which Hartford decided to let go after it ceased training candidates for the ministry in 1972 . The library was a stunning bargain ; included are 1,239 individual writings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ centuries , a considerable collection of Puritan writings from colonial New England , scores of rare hymnals , and a broad collection of Asian and African materials-though not Hartford 's prestigious Islamic collection , which it is keeping . Average cost per book : $8.
