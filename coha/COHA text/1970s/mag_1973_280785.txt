" Peronazo ! " ( Peronist blockbuster ) crowed the Buenos Aires daily Cronica . Actually , Juan Pern 's sweeping victory in Argentina 's presidential election last week was more Like the fizzle of a damp firecracker . Nobody seriously thought the old caudillo would lose , least of all Pern himself . <P> He made only a handful of appearances , none outside the capital , and left most of the campaigning to his vice-presidential running mate , his wife Isabelita ( see box ) . In fact , the only unknown in the singularly boring election was the margin of victory . It turned out to be a whopping 61.9% . Pern 's closest rival , the centrist Radical Party 's perennial loser Ricardo Balbin , received only 24.3% of the vote , virtually repeating the dismal showing he recorded against Pern more than two decades ago . <P> Thus , after an enforced 18-year hiatus , Pern was back in office . It was a remarkable comeback for a man whose second presidential term had resulted in his ouster and exile by the military @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's legions of supporters jammed Buenos Aires ' streets to celebrate the victory even before the election returns were in . The short-lived party , however , was spoiled by an ugly act of violence that threatened to set off yet another round of crises in Argentina . <P> Terrorist Acts . The trouble started on the day after the election . Interim President Raul Lastiri , in one of his last official acts , announced that he was outlawing the Trotskyite People 's Revolutionary Army , or E.R.P. Lastiri 's action was certainly justified . E.R.P. kidnapings had continued up to Election Day , and there had been terrorist acts by a variety of other extremist groups ( a British executive was seized in Buenos Aires last week ) , although none of the top Peronists had been hit . The truce ended with Lastiri 's announcement . <P> Within 24 hours , a band of suspected E.R.P. assassins ambushed Labor Leader Jose Rucci at one of the hideouts he used in central Buenos Aires ; his body was riddled with 26 bullets . Rucci , 48 , who was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Bolshies " within the unions , was head of the 3.1 million-member General Confederation of Labor , which made him one of the most powerful men in Argentina . <P> The C.G.T . instantly called a 30-hour strike , which brought the country to a standstill . In Buenos Aires , food stores and even the airports were shut down . A commuter train was burned , apparently by enraged riders . <P> The strike faced Pern with a dilemma . He could not demand that it be called off for fear of angering the right wing of his party , which admired Rucci . On the other hand , he could not try to appease the E.R.P. by backing away from the tough antiterrorist position he undoubtedly had dictated to his surrogate President without losing face . At week 's end Pern had issued no statement on the assassinations.
