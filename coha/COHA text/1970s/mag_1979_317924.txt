The willpower of the Americans astonished me ... the determination that has transformed a handful of emigrants into a powerful nation ; the industry which has made it great and wealthy ; and the wisdom which is leading it onward to a glorious and assured future . <P> - Count Vay de Vaya , a Hungarian traveler in America , 1908 <P> No power on earth can prevent the increasing equality of conditions ... from leading every member of the community to be wrapped up in himself ... And no one can foretell into what disgrace and wretchedness they would plunge themselves lest they should have to sacrifice something of their own well-being to the prosperity of their fellow creatures . <P> - Alexis de Tocqueville , Democracy in America , 1835 <P> Toward dusk , their small boats go whumping across lakes and bays , rooster-tailing on fierce twin-100 outboards . Caravans of **25;3640;TOOLONG RVs start homing off the interstates , their occupants damply chilled in the air conditioning , bathed in Dolly Parton from the tape deck . In shopping malls , supermarkets the size of National Guard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pedal pushers go Brrrr as they load their carts with food encased in a wealth of nonreturnable glass , metal and paper . They shake their heads as they pay what the check-out computer demands of them , and pile the groceries into broad-beamed station wagons . At home , the automatic icemaker sighs and clatters in the kitchen ; the automatic washer discos through the spin cycle . The microwave starts dinner . <P> Meantime , in winding ropes of bright capillaries , the slow and overpowered commuting cars poof home . From above , at night , American cities look like garishly jumbled jewelry strewn up and down the landscape ; in the centers , empty high-rises of piled diamonds glow , great sparklers kept alight for the cleaning women , for the admiration of passing planes . <P> For years foreigners have regarded America ( enviously , contemptuously ) as a shocking wastrel , besotted with its own resources , lighting its cigars with $1,000 bills . In winter , visitors remark , the U.S. is always too warm indoors , and in summer always too cold ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to turn up the White House air conditioning full blast and then start a cozy blaze in the fireplace . <P> Since the early ' 70s , Americans have been flirting reluctantly with a complicated and grudging awareness about themselves and their orgies of fossil burning . But they are still in the quibbling stage , in what psychologists call a period of " defensive avoidance . " The gas lines that started in California and have begun to spread across the country like a rumor are still open to confusing interpretations : Are they a temporary inconvenience or ominous intimations of the future ? The last gas crisis , in 1973-74 , subsided soon enough . Perhaps this one will as well ? According to the Gallup poll , more than three-quarters of Americans still believe that current gasoline shortages are a Big Oil contrivance . If decontrol begins , the assumption goes , prices will rise well above $1 a gallon and <P> Americans will all be presently awash in gas again .                 @ @ @ @
