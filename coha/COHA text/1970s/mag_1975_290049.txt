&gt; Advocates of euthanasia insist that a terminally ill person should be allowed to choose between prolonging his life and ending it . Pollster Mervin Field reports that a good many Californians , at least , appear to agree . In a recent Field poll of 504 Californians carefully selected to provide a good cross section of the state 's population , 87% agreed that incurably ill patients should have the right to refuse medication that might prolong their lives . A significant number of those polled were willing to go even further . When asked if incurably ill patients should have the right to ask for and receive medication that would painlessly end their lives , 63% ( including 41% of those over 70 ) said yes . <P> &gt; Doctors are constantly searching for new ways of diagnosing cancers early , before the tumors spread so that effective treatment is difficult . Dr. Richard Sternheimer , 74 , a pathologist at Chicago 's Michael Reese Medical Center , has now developed a staining technique that screens cells in the urine . Because urine is formed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ urethra and , in males , the prostate gland before it is excreted , it contains cells sloughed off from all of these organs . To determine if any of those cells are cancerous , Sternheimer stains them with two dyes : a blue coloring that attaches itself to the nucleus of diseased cells and a red coloring that combines with all cell components . The malignant cells are not only differentiated by color but by the rate at which they take up the dye ; they become stained before healthy cells do . Sternheimer 's test must still be tried on a large number of patients and evaluated before its effectiveness can be established . But it has already shown its potential for detecting cancers early . When a patient at Michael Reese for treatment of an eye ailment recently underwent a battery of lab tests , Sternheimer 's test suggested that he had cancer of the bladder . Surgery confirmed the cancer , and it was removed before it had spread to other organs .               @ @ @ @ @ @
