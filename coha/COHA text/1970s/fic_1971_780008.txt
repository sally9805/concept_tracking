 | Krip paused , his hand still on my webbing , while I clung with my great claws to the bunk so I would not float away , unable to govern my going . Then he responded to orders , pushing me back , making Inc secure again before he returned to his own place . " We can not have reached I'tali ! " I was still shaken from that sudden awakening . " No  --  but the ship llc ( lid not need to eontinnc . F , veu I , who was no real star voyager , could feel the diffcrcncr . ' I'licic was a catch in the rhythm of the engines .

And when lie read iiiv discovery his alarm was near fear . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such , I used the wand . I could beam-read . I have wrought the ( muster of bodies under the three rings of Sotrath . By the grace of Molaster I have done much with my talent . But this that I now touched upon was new , alien , dark , and destrnctivc beyond all my reckoning . For there flowed from that priest as he lay a current of pure power . And I could slip along it , as I did , drawing Krip 's thought with me , through the I , ydis , down to something that lay below those engines which were her life ? something in the cargo hold . And that mind power released the force of what lay in  | hiding , which had been cunningly attuned to the thought of one man alone . So that there now emanated from that hidden packet a more powerful force than any thought , and a deadly one , acting upon the heart of the Lydis to slow the beat of her engines , make them sluggish . And in time it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compelling force flowing from the mind of the priest . But it was as if the current of energy were encased in the Rock of Tormora . It could be neither cut nor swayed from its purpose . Yet I sensed that if it might be halted , then the packet would fail in turn . Learning that , Krip sent his own message : " The man then , if not his thought  --  get to the man ! " Straightway I saw he was right . Now I ceased my fight against that current and joined with Krip to seek out Lidj , who should be nearest to the stranger . And so we warned the cargomaster , urging physical action on his part . It came ! That current of feeding energy pulsed , lessened , surged again  --  then sparked weakly and was gone . The vibration in the ship steadied for perhaps four heartbeats . Then it , too , flickered off . I could feel through the Lydis the surge of will of those in her , their fear and need to hold that engine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were in orbit  --  but where and My glassia body was not fashioned to take such strains . Though I fought frantically to retain consciousness , I failed . There was a flat-sweet taste in my mouth ; moisture trickled from my muzzle . That part of me which was Vors remembered blood . I ached painfully . When I forced open  | my eyes I could see only through a mist . But the roof of the cabin was steadily up and I was pulled to the bunk by a gravity greater than that of Thoth . We had set down . Were we back on rl'hoth ? I doubted it . Hooking my claws against the sides of the bunk , I was able in spite of the webbing to wriggle closer to the edge , look down to see how it had fared with my cabinmate . As he pushed himself up his eyes met mine . There was a sudden look of concern " Maelen ! " he said aloud . " You are hurt ! " I turned attention to my body . There were bruises @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and month to bedaub my fur . Yet all hurts were small , and I reported it so . Thus we planeted , not on Thoth , nor on Ptah , which had been our goal , but on Sekhmet . Strange names , all these . Krip had long since told me that the early space explorers of his race were wont to give to suits and their attendant worlds the names of gods and goddesses known to the more primitive peoples of their own historic past . And where those worlds had no native inhabitants to use a rival name , those of the Terran explorers were accepted . These of the system of Amen-Re were so named from legend . And Krip had shown me the symbols on the map edge to identify each . They had come from the very far past . Set , too fiery to support life , had the picture of a saurian creature ; Thoth , that of a long beaked bird . Ptah was human enough , but Sekhmet was represented in that company by the furred head of a creature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and which he called a " cat . " These cats had taken to space voyaging easily and had  | been common on ships in the early days  --  though now they were few . Only a small number were carefully nurtured in the asteroid bases of the Traders . A cat 's head had Sekhmet , but the body of a woman . What powers the goddess had represented , Krip did not know . Such lore was forgotten . But this world she had given her name to was not of good repute . It had heavier gravity than Thoth or Ptah , and was so forbidding that , though there had been attempts to colonize it , those had been given up . A few prospectors came now and then , but they had discovered nothing which was not present also on Ptah and much more easily obtained there . Somewhere on its land mass was a Patrol beacon for the relaying of messages . But for the rest it was left to its scouring winds , its lowering skies , and what strange life was native to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bleak world  --  which act was a feat of skill on the parts of our pilot and engineer ? but we were in a manner now prisoners here . For that energy which had played upon our engines had done such damage as could not be repaired without supplies and tools which the Lydis did not carry . As for the priest , we had no ' answers out of him , for he was dead . Lidj , aroused by our warning , had struck quickly . His blow , meant to knock the Thothian unconscious , had not done the harm ; rather it was as if the sudden cessation of the act of sabotage had recoiled , burning life out of him . So we did not know the reason for the attack , save that it must have been aimed at keeping us from Ptah . What was left to us now was to make secure our own safety . Somewhere hidden among these roughly splintered  | hills ( for this land was all sharp peaks and valleys so deep and narrow that they might have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ giant ) there was a Patrol beacon . To reach that and broadcast for help was our only hope . Within the shell of the Lydis was a small two-man flitter , meant to be used for exploration . This was brought out , assembled for service . Over the broken terrain such a trip in search of a beacon which might lie half the world away was a chancy undertaking . And though all the crew were ready to volunteer , it was decided that they should draw lots for the search party . This they did , each man drawing from a bowl into which they had dropped small cubes bearing their rank symbols . And chance so marked down our astrogator Manus Ilunold and second engineer Griss Sharvan . They took from the stores , making packs of emergency rations and other needs . And the flitter was checked and rechecked , taken up on two trial flights , before Captain Foss was assured it would do . I had said that this was a planet of evil omen . Though I found nothing by mind-seek to indicate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the surface and the darkness of the landscape . Dark that landscape was . There are many barren stretches of waste on Yiktor . The high hill country , which is the closest thing to home territory the Thassa now hold , is largely what the lowland men term desert waste . Yet there is always a feeling of light , of freedom , therein . But here the overpowering atmosphere was one of darkness . The rocky walls of the towering escarpments were of a black or very dark-gray stone . What scanty vegetation  | there was had a ghostly wanness , being of a pallid gray hue . Or else it nearly matched the rocks in whose crevices it grew , dusky nodules so unpleasant to look upon that to touch them would require a great effort of will . Even the sand which rose in dunes across this open space where Captain Foss had brought us in for a masterly landing was more like the ashes of long-dead fires  --  so powdery and fine ( save where our deter rockets had fused it ) that it held no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the cold winds  --  winds which wailed and cried as they cut through the tortured rock of the heights . It was a land which was an enemy to our kind and which made plain that hostility as the hours passed . It was those winds which were the greatest source of concern for the flitter . If such gusts grew stronger , the light craft could not battle a passage over dangerously rough country . Some rewiring and careful work on the corn of the Lydis had brought a very weak suggestion of a signal . So our corntech Sanson Korde was certain that there was a beacon somewhere on the land where we had set down . A very small piece of doubtful good fortune . For me there was little enough to do . My paws were not designed to work on the flitter . So I set myself another task , prowling around among those grim rocks , listening with every talent I had  --  of body and mind  --  for aught which might live here and mean us ill . Sekhmet was not devoid of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which hid in the breaks between stones . But none of them thought , as we measure mind power . Of larger creatures I discovered not a trace . Which  | did not mean that such could not exist somewhere , just that if they did they were beyond the range of my present search . Though I picked up no spark of intelligent life , there was something else here which I could not explain  --  a sensation of a hovering just beyond my range of conscious search . It was a feeling I had never known before save in one place , and there I had good reason to expect such . In the highest lands of Yiktor the ' I'hassa have their own places . Once , legend tells us , we were a settled people even as the lowlanders arc today . We knew the confinement of cities , the rise of permanent walls ever about us . Then there cane a time when we made , i choice which would change not only those alive to make it then , but the generations born to follow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to other powers , invisible , immeasurable . And it was the choice of those faced by such a splitting of the life road to take that which favored mind over body . So gradually it was less and less needful for us to be rooted in one place . Possessions had little meaning . I f a man or woman had more than he needed he shared with the less fortunate . We became rovers , more at home imm the lands of the wilds than those which had held our forefathers rooted . But still there were certain sacred sites which were very old , so old that their original use had long since vanished even from the ancient tales . And these we resorted to on occasions when there was a need that we gather for a centering of the power  --  for the raising up of an Old One , or a like happening . These sites have an atmosphere , an aura , which is theirs  | alone . So that they come alive while we abide there , welcoming us with a warmth of spirit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man who has long thirsted . And this feeling  --  of vast antiquity and purpose  --  was something I well knew . But here ? Why did I have something of the same sensation  --  of an old , old thing with a kernel of meaning , a meaning I did not understand ? It was as if I had been presented with a record roll which must be learned , yet the symbols on it were so alien they sparked no meaning in my mind . And this feeling haunted me whenever I made the rounds of our improvised landing field . Yet never could I center it in any one direction so that I might explore further and discover the reason of its troubling . I felt it only as if it were part of the dry , grit-laden air , the bitter wind wailing in the rocks . I was not the only troubled one , but that which occupied the minds of my companions was a different matter . That the priest had triggered the device which had brought about our disaster they knew . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place . For a careful search had led them to the Throne of Qur . First they thought that what they sought would be within the crate which covered that . But that was not so . They fully exposed the Throne and discovered nothing . Then they began a careful search , inch by inch , of the piece itself , using their best detector . Thus Lidj had uncovered a cavity in the towering back . Pressure upon two of the gems there had released a spring . Within was a box of dull metal . The radiation reading was such that he put on protective gloves before he forced it out of its tight setting , transferring  | it into a shielded holder which was then taken out of the ship to be put among the rocks where whatever energy it broadcast could do no harm . These Traders had traveled far and had a wide knowledge of many worlds ; yet the workmanship of that box and the nature of the energy it employed were unknown to them . Save that they agreed on one thing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was manifest that the technology there was too primitive to produce such a device . " Unless , " Captain Foss commented , " these priests in their eternal treasure-seeking have uncovered secrets they are not as quick to display as the other things they have found . It is apparent that that hollow in the Throne was not lately added , but must have been a part of it since its first fashioning . Was this also left over from that time ? We have a dead man , a secret which is dangerous . We have a weapon used at just the right point in our voyage to force us to Sekhmet . And this adds up to a sum I dislike . " " But why ? We could have been left derelict in space ? " Shallard , the engineer , burst out . " It was only by the favor of fortune we were able to make a good landing here . " Foss stared across the rocks and the shifting dunes of powdery sand . " I wonder  --  on that I wonder , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two who had drawn the lots for the beacon search . " I am beginning to believe that the sooner we contact authority the better . Prepare to take off in the next lull of the wind . "  | So did they wing off in the flitter . In that was a device which kept them in contact with the Lydis , though they did not report more than passing above the same landscape as we saw . However , Foss kept in contact with them by the corn unit of the ship , and his unease was as clear as if he shouted his thoughts aloud . That we had been sabotaged it was unnecessary to question . But the reason remained unclear . Had we been delayed before take-off on Thoth , that would have been simple . Either the rebel forces or that fanatical priest could have done so . Only this stroke had come in mid-flight . Had we been meant to land on Sekhmet ? The captain was dubious about that  --  such depended too much on chance . He was more certain the attack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And the rest of the crew agreed with him . At least on-planet one had more of a fighting chance ; we might not have been given even that small advantage . In either case the threat was grave , so that even before he gave his orders to Korde , the corn-tech had opened panels , was studying the maze of wiring behind  | them . There was a chance that these elements could be converted to a super-corn , something with which to signal for help if the voyage of the flitter failed . The Traders were well used to improvising when the need arose . Night was coming  --  though the day on Sekhmet had been hardly more than pallid dusk , the cloud cover lying so thickly across the riven hills . And with that flow of shadows the cold was greater . So I bushed my fur , not consciously , but by instinct . Krip summoned me back to the ship , for they planned to seal themselves within , using that as a fort , even as it had been outside Kartum . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Nothing which I could point to and say , " This is danger . " Yet As the hatch closed behind me , the warmth and light of the Lydis giving a sense of security , still I was troubled by that other feeling  --  that we were ringed about by ? What ? I used my claws to climb the ladder which led to the living quarters . But I was opposite the hatch of the hold wherein sat the Throne when I paused , clinging to the rungs . My head swung to that closed door as if drawn by an overwhelming force . So great was the pull that I hunched from the ladder itself to the space by the door , my shoulder brushing its surface . That box which had wrought our disaster was now safely gone ; I had watched its outside disposal . But from this room flowed a sense of ? " life " is the closest I could come to describing it . I might now be in the field of some invisible communication . There was not only the mental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My fur was rippling as it might under the touch of a strong wind . I must have  | given forth a mind-call , for Krip 's answer came quickly : " Maelen ! What is it ? " I tried to reply , but there was so little of which I could make a definite message . Yet what I offered was enough to summon them to me with speed  --  Krip , the captain , and Lidj . " But the box is gone , " Captain Foss said . He stepped to one side as Lidj crowded past to reopen the sealed hatch . " Or ? Can there be another ? " Krip 's hand was on my head , smoothing that oddly ruffled fur . His face expressed his concern , not only for what danger might lurk here , but in a measure for me also . For he knew that I could not tell what lay behind the door , and my very ignorance was an additional source of danger . I was shaken now as I had never been in the past . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , light flashed within . There sat the Throne , facing us squarely . They had not recrated it as yet . Only the cavity in the back was closed again . The captain turned to me . " Well , what is it ? " But in turn I looked to Krip . " Do you feel it ? " He faced the Throne , his face now blank of expression , his dark Thassa eyes fixed . I saw his tongue pass over his lower lip . " I feel  --  something ? " But his puzzlement was strong . Both the other Traders looked from one of us to the other . It was plain they did not share what we felt . Krip took a step forward  --  put his hand to the seat of the Throne . I cried aloud my protest as a glassia growl . But too late . His finger tips touched the red metal . A visible shudder  | shook his body ; he reeled back as if he had thrust his hand into open fire  --  reeled and fell against Lidj @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep him from sliding to the floor . The captain rounded on me . " What is it ? " he demanded . " Force ? " I aimed mind-speech at him . " Strong force . I have never met its like before . " He jerked away from the Throne . Lidj , still supporting Krip , did the same . " But why do n't we also feel it ? " the Captain asked , now eyeing the Throne as if he expected it to discharge raw energy into his very face . " I do not know  --  perhaps because the Massa are more attuned to what it exudes . But it is broadcasting force , and out there " ? I swung my head to indicate the wall of the ship ? " there is something which draws such a broadcast . " The captain studied the artifact warily . ' I'hcn he came to the only decision a man conditioned as a Free Trader could make . The safety of the Lydis was above all else . " We unload  --  not just the Throne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what 's behind it all . " I heard Lidj suck in his breath sharply . " ' l'o break contract ? " lie began , citing another part of the ' I'raders ' creed . " No contract holds that a cargo of danger must be transported , the more so when that danger was not made plain at the acceptance of the bargain . ' l'he I , ydi , s has already been planetcd through the agency of this this treasure ! We are only lucky that we are not now in a drifting derelict because of it . This must go out  --  speedily ! " So , despite the dark , floodlights were strung , and once more the robos were put to work . This time they trundled  | to the hatches all those crates , boxes , and bales which had been so carefully stowed there on Thoth . Several of the robos were swung to the ground and there set to plowing through the dunes , piling the cargo within such shelter as a ridge of rock afforded . And there last of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beauty uncovered , since they did not wait to crate it again . " Suppose " ? Lidj stood checking off the pieces as the robos brought them along ? " this is just what someone wants  --  that we dump it where it can be easily picked up ? " " We have alarms rigged . Nothing can approach without triggering those . And then we can defend it . " The captain spoke to me . " You can guard ? " It was very seldom during the months since I had joined the ship that he had asked any direct service of me , though he acknowledged I had talents which his men did not possess . What I had I gave willingly , before it was asked . It would seem now that he hesitated a little , as if this was a thing for which I ought to be allowed to volunteer . I answered that I could and would  --  though I did not want to come too close to that pile of cargo , especially the glittering Throne . So they rigged their alarms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Krip came down the ramp . His adventure in the hold had so affected him that he had had to withdraw for a space to his cabin . Now he wore the thermo garments made for cold worlds , the hood pulled over his head , the mittens on his hands . And he carried a weapon I had seldom seen him use  --  a blaster . " Where do you think you 're ? " the captain began when Krip interrupted . " I stay with Maelen . Perhaps I do not have her power ,  | but still I am closer to her than the rest of you are . I stay . " At first the captain looked ready to protest , then he nodded . " Well enough . " When they had gone and the ramp was back in the ship , Krip waded through the drifting sand to look at the Throne ? though the kept well away from it , I was glad to note . " What  --  and why ? " " What and why , indeed , " I made answer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have claws to unsheathe . Perhaps the captain is wrong and we were indeed meant to land here , even to unload the cargo . Only that dead priest could answer us truly what and why . " I sat up on my haunches , balancing awkwardly as one must do in a body fashioned to go on four feet when one would be as erect as one ready to march on two . The wind curled about my ribs and back in a cold lash , yet my fur kept me warm . Ilowever , the sand-ash arose ill great choking swirls , shifting over the Throne of Our . Now I squinted against that blowing grit , my gaze fixed upon the chair . Did  --  did I sec for an instant divorced from true time what my eyes reported ? Or did I imagine it only ? Did the dust fashion , even as if it clung to an invisible but solid core , the likeness of a body enthroned as might be a judge to give voice upon our affairs ? It was only for an instant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The wind ( frivol ( lust collapsed into a film on the red metal . And I do not t 11ink Krip saw it at all . " There was nothing more in the night . Our lights continued to shine on the air-spun dust , which built small hillocks around the boxes . My most alert senses could not pick up any echo among the rocks or in the near hills . We might  | have dreamed it all , save that we knew we had not . A fancy that it had been done to force the cargo out into the open settled so deep in my mind that I almost believed it the truth . But if we had been so worked upon to render the treasure vulnerable , no one now made any move to collect it . Sekhmet had no moon to ride her cloudy sky . Beyond the circle of lights the darkness was complete . Shortly after the ship was sealed again , the wind died , the sand and dust ceased to drift . It was very quiet , almost too much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stronger . Yet there came no attack  --  if any menace did lurk . Flowever , in the early morning something occurred , in its way a greater blow at the Lydis , at our small party , than any attack of a formless evil . For this was concrete , a matter of evidence . The flitter 's broadcast suddenly failed . All efforts to re-establish contact proved futile . Somewhere out in the waste of hills , mountains , knife-sharp valleys , the craft and her crew of two must be in trouble . Since the Lydis carried only one flitter , there was no hope of manning a rescue flyer . Any such trip must be done overland . And the terrain was such as to render that wellnigh impossible . We could depend now only on the improvised corn in the ship . To gather volume enough to signal off-world , Korde must tap our engines . Also , for any such broadcast there would be a frustrating time lag . As was customary among the Traders , the remaining members of the crew assembled to discuss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to what must be done . Because Free Traders are bound to their ships , owning no home world of earth and stone , water and air , they are more  | closely knit together than many clans . That they could abandon two of their number lost in the unknown was unthinkable . Yet to search on foot for them was a task defeated before begun . Thus caught between two needs , they were men entrapped . Shallard agreed that the Lydis might just be able to rise from her present site . But that she could again make a safe landing he doubted . All his delving into the engines did not make plain just what had hit her power , but important circuits were burned out . Again , as was the custom , each man offered what suggestions he could . Though in the end there was only one which could be followed  --  that the off-world corn must be put into operation . It was then that I , idj voiced a warning of his own . " It can not be overlooked , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulled into a trap . Oh , I know that it is just on the edge of possibility that we were meant t o fin clown here on Sekhmet . On the other hand , how many cases of actual looting of ships in space are known ? Such tales are more readily found on the fiction tapes , where the authors are not bound by the technical difficulties of such a maneuver . I think we can assume that the cargo is what led to sabotage . All right  --  who wants it ? The rebels , that fanatic of a priest ? Or some unknown party , who hopes to gather in loot worth more stellars than we could coma in a year  --  if they could lift it from us and transport it out ? " Once away from this system , it would be a matter of possession being nine-tenths of the law . Only here are the claims of the priesthood recognized as legal . You have heard of the Abna expedition , and the one that I larre Iargo managed ten years back ? They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . The priests yelled themselves near black in the face over both , but the finds were legitimate , made by the men who ran the stuff out  --  they were not stolen . " Then there are the laws of salvage . Think about those carefully . Suppose the Lydis had crashed here . That would cancel our own contract . Such an accident would open up a neat loophole which would be easy to use . Anyone finding a wrecked ship on an unsettled world ? " " That would only apply , " cut in Captain Foss , " if all the crew were dead . " He did not have to underline that for us . A moment later he added : " I think we can be sure this is sabotage . And certainly this idea of a third party is logical . It could explain what happened to the flitter . " As he said , it all fitted together neatly . Yet , perhaps because my way of thinking was Thassa and not Trader , because I depended not upon machines and their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There was something in what I had felt by the Throne of Qur , in that lowering feeling of being watched , which did not spring from any ordinary experience . No , in an indefinable way it was oddly akin to the Thassa . And I was sure that this affair was of a different nature from those of the Traders . But because I had no proof , nothing but this feeling , I did not offer my suggestion . Those on the Lydis believed now that they were under siege , must wait for the unknown enemy to show his hand in some manner . And they voted to turn all their efforts to the broadcast for aid . However , only two of them could provide the knowledgeable assistance Korde needed . For the others , Captain Foss had another task . That cargo now piled in open sight was ,  | he decided , to be hidden as quickly as possible . Once more he disembarked the working robos , while Krip and I went out from the immediate vicinity of the ship in search @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possibilities in this very rough country . But we wanted one which would fulfill the captain 's needs best  --  that being a site which could be sealed once the treasure was stowed . So we examined any narrow crevice , surveyed carefully any promising hole which might give entrance to a cave or other opening . I was no longer aware of any current flowing between the Throne and some place beyond the valley . In the morning 's early light that artifact , now shrouded in dust which clouded its brilliance , was only an inanimate object . One might well believe that imagination had supplied the happenings of the night before , except that it had not . Had that emanation been a kind of beacon , informing others of our position ? If so , once they were sure , they could well have turned off that which made a magnet of the cargo . So , as we went , I mind-searched as well as I could , even though to beamread properly and at a goodly distance I did not have what I needed most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for complete concentration  --  shutting all else out of my mind . We came at last to a ridge taller than those immediately around our landing site . And the light was brighter , the sullen clouds less heavy . Along the wall Some trick of the light , together with a filmy deposit of sand which clung in curve and cut and hollow ? I rose to my haunches , straining back my short neck , longing for a better range of vision .  | Because the dust and the light made clear something of those lines on the stone . I saw there a design , far too regular in pattern for me to believe that it had been formed by erosion alone , the scouring of the wind-driven sand . " Krip ! " At my summons he turned back from where he had gone farther down that cut . " The wall ? " I drew his attention to what seemed clearer and clearer the longer I studied it  --  that pattern so worn by the years that at first it could hardly be distinguished at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at it . But there was only open puzzlement on his face . " The pattern there . " By now it was so plain to me I could not understand why he also did not see it . " Look ? " I became impatient as I pointed as best I could with a forepaw , unsheathing claws as if I could reach up and trace the lines themselves . " Thus  --  and thus  --  and thus ? " I followed the lines so , in and out . There were gaps , of course , but the over-all spread was firm enough not to need all the parts long weathered away . He squinted , his eyes obediently following my gestures . Then I saw the dawn of excitement on his face . " Yes ! " His own mittened hand swung up as he , too , traced the design . " It is too regular to be natural . But ? " Now I sensed a whisper of alarm in his mind  --  as if something in the design was wrong . It was when I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but moving back even farther to catch the whole of it , that I saw it was not the abstract design my eyes had first reported . What was really pictured on the cliff side was a face  | ? or rather a mask . And that was of something neither human nor of any creature I knew . But into Krip 's mind flashed one word ? " cAT ! " Once he had so identified it I could indeed trace a resemblance between it and the small symbol on the old map of the Amen-Re system . Yet it was also different . That head had been more rounded , far closer to a picture one could associate with a living animal . This was a distinctly triangular presentation with the narrowest angle pointing to the foot of the cliff . In the area at the wider top there were two deep gashes set aslant to form eyes . Deep and very dark , giving one the disturbing impression that they pitted a skull . There was an indication of a muzzle with a lower opening , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a series of lines made upstanding ears . There was nothing normal about the mask . Yet once it was called to nay at tention , I could see that it had evolved from a cat 's head . I had felt nothing but interest when I had seen the cat on the chart , a desire to see one of these animals for myself . But this thing  --  it was not of the same type at all . The hollow which was the mouth held my interest now . And I went to explore it . Though the opening was so narrow that anyone of human bulk must crouch low to enter , I could do it with ease . In I padded , needing to know the why and wherefore , for so much effort had been expended in making the carving that I was sure it had a purpose . The space was shallow  --  hardly more than half again the length of my glassia body . I raised one of my paws and felt before me , for it was too dark here to sec . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yet my seeking claws caught and ran along grooves , which I traced until I was sure that those marked divisions of blocks which had been carefully fitted into place . When I reported this to Krip I was already sure of what we might have discovered by chance . While Sekhmet had never been known to house any treasure ( perhaps it had never been well searched ) , we could have discovered such a hiding place . Though we had little time to prove or disprove it . I tried to work my claw tips between the stones , to see if they could be so loosened . But it was impossible . When I scrambled out , Krip had his wrist corn uncovered , was reporting our find . Though the captain showed some interest , he urged us now to carry out our original task and locate a place where the cargo could be cached . " Not around here . " Krip 's decision matched mine . " If they  --  whoever they may be  --  do come looking , we need not direct them in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's head . Thus we turned directly away from that , heading to the northwest . So we came upon a crevice which the light of Krip 's torch told us deepened into a cave . And since we had found nothing so good closer to our landing site , we selected that . So rough was the terrain that the passage of each laden robo had to be carefully supervised . Foss wanted no cutting or smoothing of the way to the hiding place . It took us most of the remaining daylight hours to see all into the crevice . Once the cargo was stowed , rocks were built into  | a stopper , well under the overhang of the outer part of the crevice , where they might be overlooked unless someone was searching with extra care . Then a small flamer , such as is used for ship repairs , was brought in and the rocks fused into a cork which would take a great deal of time and trouble to loosen . Lidj made a last inspection . " Best we can do . Now  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We led them to the cliff face . It was difficult now , though they shone working lights on it , to see the lines which had been more distinct in the early morning . I thought perhaps the dust had largely blown away . Lidj at first professed to distinguish nothing . And it was only when he hunched well down and centered a torch into the mouth , located that inner wall of blocks , that he was convinced the find was not some far flight of imagination . " Well enough , " he admitted then . " What this may lead to " ? he held the torch closer to the wall ? " can be anyone 's guess . Certainly nothing we can explore now . But who knows about later ? " However , I knew that beneath his outer calm he was excited . This was such a find as might return to the Lydis all the lost profit from this voyage  --  perhaps even more .  | " Men who go looking for trouble never have far to walk . " Lidj leaned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ middle . He was not gazing at me , but rather at the wall over my head . In another man his tone might have been one of resignation . But Juhel Lidj was not one to be resigned or lacking in enterprise in any situation , or so it had been so far during our association . " And we have been looking for trouble ? " I dared to prod when he did not add to that statement . " Perhaps we have , Krip , perhaps we have . " Still he watched the wall as if somewhere on it were scrawled or taped the answer to our puzzle . " I do n't believe in curses ? not unless they are my own . But neither do I know that that priest back on Thoth did not know exactly what he was doing . And , to my belief , he was playing some hand of his own . When the news comes that we are missing , then his credit will go up . The efficiency of his communication with their god will be proven . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ followed him . " Then you believe that that is at the bottom of it , that we do n't have to be worried about being jumped while here ? " Now he did glance at me . " Do n't put words in my mouth , Krip Vorlund . Perhaps my suggestion is just another logical deduction . I 'm not a thcurgist of Manical , to draw lines on my palm with a sacred crayon , pour a spot of purple wine in the middle , and then read the fate of the ship pictured therein . To my mind there is the smell of temple intrigue in this , that is all . The question which is most important is , how do we get out of their trap ? " That brought back what was uppermost in our minds , the disappearance , if not from the sky of Sekhmet , at least from our visa-screen , of the flitter . This was , judging by the terrain immediately about us , a harsh world , and forced down on such , Hunold and Sharvan would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Would they struggle on , trying to reach the beacon , or were they already attempting to fight their way back to the Lydis ? Perhaps it all depended upon how far they judged themselves to be from either goal . The Traders stand by their own . Such is bred in us , as much as the need for space , the impatience and uneasiness which grips us when we have been too long planetside . It was only the knowledge that without any guides , we ourselves might wander fruitlessly and to no useful purpose , which kept us chained to the Lydis and not out searching for our lost shipmates . " Korde can do it , if it can be done . There is a Patrol asteroid station between here and Thoth . If he can beam  | a signal strong enough to reach either that or some cruise ship of theirs , then we 're set . " Patrol ? Well , the Patrol is necessary . There must be some law and order even in space . And their men are always under orders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it grated on our Free Trader pride to have to call for such help . We were far too used to our independence . I spun the case of a report tape between thumb and forefinger , guessing just how much this galled our captain . " One thing on the credit side , " Lidj continued . " That find which your furred friend turned up out there . If there is a treasure cache here , the priests can not claim it . But we can . He was once more staring at the wall . I did not have to mind-probe to know what occupied his thoughts . Such a find would not only render the Lydis famous , but perhaps lift us all to the status of contract men , with enough credits behind us to think of our own ships . Even more so since the find was made on a planet where exploration was not restricted , where more than one such could be turned up . I had been thinking ever since Maelen had drawn my attention to those cliff-wall carvings . And I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A Free Trader 's success depends on many things , luck being well to the fore among those . So luck had been with us here , good as well as bad . But the firm base of any Trader 's efficiency is knowledge , not specialized as a tech must have , but wide  --  ranging from the legends of desert rovers on one planet to the habits of ocean plants on another . We listened , we kept records , we went with open  | minds and very open ears wherever we planeted , or when we exchanged news with others of our kind . " When Korde is through with this corn hookup , do you suppose he could rig something else ? " I knew what I wanted , but the technical know-how to make it was beyond my skill . " Just what , and for what purpose ? " " A periscope drill . " The term might not be the right one , but that was the closest I could come to describing what I had read about in the tapes . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Sattra II where the Zacathans were prospecting for the Ganqus tombs . With something like that we might be able to get an idea of what is back in the cliff . It saves the labor of digging in where there may be nothing worth hunting . As on Jason , where the tombs of the Three-eyes had already been looted ? " " You have information on this ? " " Just what it does , not the mechanics of it . " I shook my head . " You 'd have to have a tech work it out . " " Maybe we can  --  if we have the time . Bring me that note tape . " When I returned to my cabin to get that , Maelen raised her head from the cushion of her forepaws , her gold eyes agleam . Though I saw a glassia , yet when her thoughts met mine it was no animal sharing my small quarters . In my mind she was as I first saw her , slender in her gray-and-red garments , the soft fur of her jacket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set between the winging lift of her fair silver brows , her hair piled formally high with ruby-headed pins to hold it . And that picture I held closer because somehow , though she had never brought it  | into words between us , she found comfort in the knowledge that I saw her as the Thassa Moon Singer who saved my life when I was hunted through the hills of Yiktor . " There is news ? " " Not yet . " I pulled down one of the seats which snapped up to the wall when not in use . " You can not contact them ? " But I need not have asked that . Had she been able , we would have known it . Her gifts , so much the less compared to what they had once been , were always at our service . " No . Perhaps they have gone too far  --  or perhaps I am too limited now . But it is not altogether concern for those of our company missing which lies in your mind now . " I clicked one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the notation I wanted . " Maelen , is there any way to thought-see through the cliff  --  behind the cat mask ? " She did not answer me at once . She must have been considering carefully before she did . " Mind-send must have a definite goal . If I knew of some spark of life there I could focus upon it . As it is  --  no . But ? you have thought of some way ? " She had been quick to pick that up from me . " Something I heard of  --  a periscope drill . It might just work here , so we could learn if we have found a treasure cache or not . Yes , here it is . " I snapped the tape into my reader , ran it along impatiently , seeking the pertinent section . She shared my absorption in that rather vague report which a fellow Trader , who had been chartered to supply the Zacathan expedition , had furnished me.  | " It seems a complicated machine , " she commented , not entirely with favor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ machines and any need to depend upon them . But if it works , then I can see it in use here . Also , I believe you are correct in your guess that if this is a treasure cache it will not be the only one to be found on Sckhmet . " Krip , do you remember how once , long ago it now seems , we spoke of treasure and you said that it could be many things on many worlds , but that each man had his own idea of what it was ? Then you added that what would be precious to you was a ship of your own , that that was what your people considered true treasure . Suppose this cache , or another , were to yield enough to give you that . What would you do with such a ship  --  voyage , as does the Lydis , seeking profit wherever chance and trade call you ? " She was right in that a ship was the Trader standard of treasure . Though it would take a sum beyond perhaps even the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for each member of the Lydis 's crew . And all finds would be shared . But a ship of my own Dreams can be dreamed , but to bring them alive calls for logic and planning . I was in training as a cargomaster and , as I well knew and admitted , a long way from being ready to take full responsibility for top rating even in that berth . I was no pilot , engineer , astrogator . What would I truly do if I had credits in my belt tomorrow which would buy me the ship of my daydreaming ? Again she followed niy thoughts . " Do you remember , Krip Vorlund , how you spoke when  | I told you my fancy  --  of taking my little people in a ship to the stars ? Could such a treasure buy that ship ? " So she still held to her dream ? Though perhaps it had now even less chance of realization than mine . " It would have to be a treasure past all reckoning , " I told her soberly . " Agreed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a closed mind . The Thassa know Yiktor in width and length , but they know not space . I have learned that there are limits of which I was unaware when I claimed to be a Moon Singer of power . We are but a small people among many , many races and species . Yet to recognize that is a good beginning . With your delving machine do you go hunting , Krip  --  if the time is given you . " " Lidj thinks ? " I told her what the cargomaster had said . But before I had finished , her furred head moved from side to side . " Such a conclusion is logical . But there is this . Since I first took sentry duty here , I know we have been watched . " " What ! By whom  --  from where ? " " It is because I can not answer just such questions that I have not given a warning . Whatever it is which forces my unease , it lurks beyond the edge of my probe . I can no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power when they reft from me my wand . There only remains enough to warn . What is here only watches ; it has yet made no move . But  --  tell me . Krip  --  why is it that a cat face is upon the cliff wall ? " Her sudden change of subject startled me . And I could not give her an answer .  | " This is what I mean . " Her thought-send was impatient . " The cat is an ancient symbol of Sekhmet , for whom this planet is named . That you told me . But  --  were not this sun and its attendant worlds given their names originally by some Scout of your people who landed here in exploration ? Therefore the cat is an off-world symbol . " Yet here we find it  --  or a pattern enough like it so that you say cat ' at once when you trace it  --  marking something not left by settlers of your kind . Why did these unknown and forgotten earlier ones use the cat mask ? " I had not really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left by the first settlers . Perhaps they tried to colonize Sekhmet before the other planets . " " I think riot . I think this is far too old . How many years has this system been settled ? Do you have such a record ? " " I do n't know . If they were of the first wave , perhaps a thousand years , a little less . " " Yet I would judge that carving to be twice , maybe thrice that age . To erode stone so deeply takes a long time . At our places on Yiktor that is so . And the rest of the treasures are not of settler making ; they were found by the first men to land . Still we have here a cat mask ! Who , and how old , were the gods for whom this system was named  --  this catheaded Sekhmet ? " " They were Terran and very old even on that world . And Terra took to space a thousand years ago . " I shook my head . " Much history has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ halfway across the galaxy from here . When such gods and goddesses were worshiped , her people had no space travel . " " Perhaps your species did not then go forth from their  | parent world . But did any visit them there ? The races of the Forerunners  --  how many such civilizations rose and fell ? " " No one knows , not even the Zacathans , who make the study of history their greatest science and art . And nowadays even Terra is half legend . I have never met a spacefarer who has actually been there , or one who can claim clear descent from its people . " " Fable , legend  --  in the core of such there exists a small kernel of truth . Maybe here ? " The corn over my head crackled and Foss sounded a general message . " Broadcast now possible . We are sending off-world . " Though whether that effort would avail us , who could tell ? I took my tape and went back to Lidj , playing the pertinent portion for him and then again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he and Korde could produce any such instrument , but went off again at last to consult his own records . Waiting can be very wearying . We set up a watch which did not involve either Korde , always on corn duty , or Shallard . Maelen and I shared a term . We made only the rounds of the valley in which the Lydis had finned down , not venturing beyond its rim , however much we would have liked to explore near the cat mask or prospect about that for other indications that long-ago men , or other intelligent beings , had been there . We saw no one , heard nothing ; nor was Maelen able to pick up any thought waves to suggest that this was more than a deserted stretch of inhospitable land . However , she continued to affirm that there was an influence of some  | kind hanging about which puzzled and , I think ( though this she did not admit ) , alarmed her . Maelen had always been much of an enigma to me . At first her alienness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been strengthened when she had used her power to save my life by the only method possible  --  making man into beast . Or rather moving that which was truly Krip Vorlund from one body to another . That the man body had died through mischance had not been her fault , hard as my loss had seemed to me at the time . She had given me the use of a barsk 's body . And she had brought me to the one I now wore in turn . Thassa I walked , though Thassa I did not now live . And perhaps that outer shell of Thassa moved me closer in spirit than I had been before to the Moon Singer , Mistress of Little Ones , that I had known . Sometimes I found myself deliberately trying to tap whatever residue of Thassa might linger in my body , so that I could better understand Maelen . Three guises I had worn in less than one planetary year ? man , beast , Thassa . And the thought ever lurked in the depths of my mind that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body finally became mine , was long dead . As a Thassa undergoing instruction he had taken on beast form , and in that form he had been killed by an ignorant hunter from the lowlands , poaching on forbidden territory . In his humanoid form the beast spirit had gone mad after a space , unable to adjust  --  so that what remained was a living husk . I had displaced no one when I took that husk . But the body which had been Maelen 's  --  that had died . And only because Vors , one of her Little Ones , had offered  | her spirit a dwelling place had she survived . The Old Ones had condemned her to live as Vors for a time they reckoned by a reading of the stars which hung in Yiktor 's skies . But when that time had passed  --  where would she find a new body ? That question troubled me from time to time , though I strove to hide it from her , having a strange feeling that such speculation would be forbidden , or was wrong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But she never had . I wanted to know more of the Thassa , but there was a barrier still raised around certain parts of their lives , and that I dared not breach . Now we stood together in the early morning , having climbed to the cliff top which was part of the valley rim . Maelen faced out , her head pointing in the direction the flitter had taken as it bore off into the unknown . The wind ruffled her fur just as it also curled about my thermo jacket . " Out there  --  it abides , " came her thought . " What does ? " " I do not know , save that it lies there waiting , watching ? ever . Or  --  does it dream ? " " Dream ? " Her choice of word surprised me . Though I strove with all the esper talent I had to catch that emanation which appeared so clear to Maelen , I had never yet touched it . " Dream , yes . There are true dreams which can be foreseeing . Surely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I dreamed  --  that I know . Yet the manner of my dream I can not recall  --  save in small snatches of light , color , or feeling . " " Feeling ? " I sought to lead her on .  | " Waiting ! That is the feeling ! " There was triumph as she solved a problem . " I was waiting for something near me , something of such importance my life depended upon it . Waiting ! " She held to the last word as if it were part of an important formula . " But the rest ? " " A place strange and yet not strange  --  I knew it and yet knew it not . Krip " ? her head swung around ? " when you ran as Jorth the barsk , did you not fear that in some ways the beast was becoming greater than the man ? " So did I at last learn her fear , as if she had described a vision of terror . I went to one knee and put my arms about that furred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that this fear would be hers , knowing that body change was a part of Thassa life . But perhaps she was no longer guarded by the safe checks they used on Yiktor . " You think this may be true for you ? " She was very close to me , passive in my hold , yet still her mind held aloof . Perhaps she already regretted even that small reaching for reassurance . " I do not know , no longer am I sure . " Her admission was painful . " I try  --  how I try  --  to be Maelen . But if I become all Vors ? " " Then shall I remember Maelen for us both ! " What I could offer her I did . And it was the truth ! Let her slip back into the animal , yet I would make myself continue to sec not fur but firm pale flesh , silver hair , dark eyes in a humanoid face , the grace , the pride , and the beauty of the Moon Singer . " And neither shall I let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forget ! "  | " Yet I think of a failing memory ? " If thought could come as a whisper , so did hers sink so low . My wrist corn buzzed , and I stripped back my mitten to listen to the click of code . Fortune was favoring us . Our off-world signal had raised an answer far sooner than our most optimistic hopes had dared suggest . There was a Patrol Scout coming in and we were now recalled to the Lydis . The Scout set down in the night , braking rockets flaring in a valley near our own . Her crew would not try to reach us until morning , but in the meantime we beamed through to them a full report of all that had happened since our lift-off from Thoth . All except one matter  --  our find of the cat mask on the cliff . In return the Scout had news of import for us . The rebellion on Thoth had flared high in Kartum , fed by a split within the loyalist party arising from the cursing of our ship . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ruling caste so broken , the rebels had found it easy to infiltrate and conquer . Those with whom we had had a contract were now dead . The rebels were demanding the return of the treasure . And there was talk that we had meant all the time to space with it as our spoil . We listened to this and then Foss spoke : " It seems we now have another problem . Perhaps we ( lid better than we knew when we cached the cargo here . Until we can sort out just who takes lawful custody now , let it remain where it is . " " It is contracted still for Ptah , " Lidj pointed out . " We only cached it for fear of its possible influence . "  | " Our contract was given by men now dead . I want to know the situation on Ptah before we go in there  --  if the rebels have a foothold there too . Dead men do n't own anything , unless you count their tombs . If the government is changed , what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caught on another planet with a cargo of uncertain origin can put a Trader out of business  --  perhaps permanently . Until we are sure of the present owners , we want to take no chances of being accused , as it seems we already are , of jacking it all ourselves . I am depositing second-copy contract tapes with the Patrol at once . That will cover us for a while . But we 'll leave the cache as it is until we hear from the temple on Ptah . " " What about payment ? " Lidj asked . " According to contract we were to take our pick after we set down on Ptah . We ca n't collect before delivery . And a dry run , with repairs unpaid for , is a setback we are not able to take now . We dumped cargo at Kartum to take this on . " " Interference claim  --  at least to cover repairs ? " I ventured . " We can prove it was that box and the priest that brought us here . That ought to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lidj agreed . But get to the fine points of stellar law and this can he argued out for years . If we pick up our pay at the end it will be too late to help us . We could he bankrupt or dead by the time the space lawyers got tired of clicking their jaws over it . We need that carriage fee . In fact , we have to have it if we are going to continue lifting ship ! " On the other hand , we dare not be accused of looting either . The best we can do at present is make a formal Claim of Interference , post our tapes , and ask for an investi-  | gation on Ptah  --  to be made by the Patrol . If they reply that everything is as usual there , are you willing to chance delivery ? " We agreed . I wondered a little at Foss 's seeming reluctance to proceed without a solemn , signed crew agreement . Traders are always cautious , to a point . But Free Traders , especially on a Class @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to many second thoughts . We are of an exploring fraternity , willing to run risks in order to work among our own kind . Did Foss suspect something which was not clear to the rest of us ? The fact that he even suggested that the ship not resume her voyage to Ptah after the necessary repairs was suspicious . Yet after we were alone , making a recorder copy of all matters pertaining to the contract , Lidj did not comment . And since he did not , I was silent also . By early morning we had our tape ready as the Patrol flitter came gliding over the barrier of the valley wall and stirred up ashy sand in landing beside the Lydis . The two men who climbed out of the small flyer appeared to be in no great hurry to join Foss , who stood at the foot of our downed ramp . Instead one knelt in the sand , setting up an instrument . And the other watched him closely . They could have been conducting an exploring survey .  | There is something about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ citizen with a clear conscience on the defensive . So it was when we fronted the representatives of the Patrol . As law-abiding and inoffensive space traders , making regular contributions to planetary landing taxes , all papers in order , we had every right to call upon their help . It was just that they eyed us with an impassivity which suggested that to them , everything had to be proved twice over . However , we had the box taken from the Throne of Qur carefully disinterred after they admitted that their own instruments registered emanations of a heretofore unknown radiation . It was surrendered gladly to their custody , along with the body of the priest , which had been in freeze . And we each entered testimony on the truth tape , which could not be tampered with . With relief we knew they had not asked all the questions they might have . Our find at the cat cliff was still our secret  | ? though we did tell of the cargo cache . Lidj , armed with all the precedents of space law , explained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our voyage and deliver the treasure to the temple on Ptah  --  providing we were sure that the priests to whom it was officially consigned were still in power . " We have no news from Ptah . " The pilot of the Scout displayed so little interest in Foss 's inquiries it was plain our present dilemma was of no concern to him . " Your repairs , yes . Our engineer has checked with your man . We want visa-tapes of the damage for our report . We can lift you and your engineer off to our space base , where you can indite under League contract for what you need . " Indite under League contract was a suggestion to worry one , though here we had no alternative . Once we had so indited we would be answerable not to the Patrol , but to our own people . Not to pay up within the stated time meant having the Lydis put under bond . There was so great a demand for ships ( men waited for frustrating years for some stroke . of luck which would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spacing ) that bonds weighed heavily on those who had to accept them . They could mean the loss of a ship . So we had no way of recouping , save that of delivering our cargo to Ptah , hoping to collect . That  --  or the wild chance that the cat cliff hid something worth the labor of breaking in . We had no time now to build a probe , nor could we do that without giving away the reason . In the end it was decided that Foss and Shallard would lift with the Scout . But an armed party of Patrol , plus their flitter , would remain on Sekhmet , their first order being to search for our missing men .  | Since the Patrol flitter was a heavy-duty craft , armed and protected by every device known , it might have a better chance in a search . It carried a pilot , two gunners to man its shockers , and room for two more passengers . There was no drawing of lots this time . Before he took off for the Scout Foss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go . With her powers to search and yours to interpret ? " Of course he was right , though the Patrolman regarded his choice of what appeared to be an animal with open disbelief . However , though I gave no history of Maelen 's past , I laid it out clearly that she was telepathic and would be our guide . Since no man may know all there is to be learned about alien creatures , they accepted my assurance of her worth . For a full day after the Scout lifted with Captain Foss and Shallard , there was a storm lapping at the Lydis , raising the fine dust of the valley into an impenetrable fog , keeping us pent within the ship , the Patrolmen with us . There was no setting out in this murk , since we could not fly on any set beam but would be questing freely over an unknown area . But on the second morning the wind failed . And though the ash-sand had drifted high about the fins of the ship and half buried the flitter , which was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we could take off . As we swung out over the knife-ridged country , the massed clouds overhead broke a little now and then , though the sunlight- which came through was pale and seemed devoid of heat . Its radiance accentuated the general gloom of the landscape beneath us rather than dispersing it .  | The pilot kept to the lowest speed , watching his instruments for any sign of radiation which might be promising . Maelen crouched beside me in the cramped cabin of the craft . It was seldom I was truly aware of her present form , but with the Patrolmen glancing at her as if she were a very outre piece of equipment , I was more conscious of her fur , her four feet , the glassia guise . And because I had heard her plaint of fear , that she might in time slide back too far into the animal to be sure of her identity as a Thassa , her unease was plainer to me . I myself had known moments when beast eclipsed man . What if my identity had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had been to overpower the flesh envelope she wore , since she knew well all its dangers . But if her steady confidence was beginning to fade She stirred , muscles moving with liquid grace under her soft fur . Her head pointed away in a quick turn . " Something ? " I asked . " Not what I seek now . But  --  but there is that down there which is not of rock and sand . " I craned to look through the vision port . Nothing showed to my sight , but rocks twisted and eroded into such wild shapes could hide anything . " Within ? " she informed me . " But we are already past . I think perhaps another cache ? " I tried to memorize landmarks , though such seen from the air and from the ground were two different matters . But if Maelen was right , and her certainty of report suggested that she could be depended upon to be that , perhaps we had indeed come upon that which would redeem all  | debts we might incur through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prove as rich a treasure field as Thoth ? perhaps more so ? However , Maelen reported nothing else as we flew in a zigzag pattern , cruising back and forth over the broken land . The country was bad for visual sighting . There were too many of those deep , narrow valleys which might have swallowed up a grounded or crashed flitter , hiding it even from air survey . And we knew only the general direction . Back and forth , as all the rocks took on the same look ? though we did pass over several wider valleys where there were stands of withered vegetation . One held a cup of water in the form of a small , dark lake rimmed with a wide border of yellow-white which may have been a noxious chemical deposit . Maelen stirred again , pressing more tightly against me , as she stretched her head toward the vision port . " What now ? " " Life ? " she signaled . At the same time our pilot leaned forward to regard more closely one of the many dials before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reported . Though we were already at a low altitude , he dropped us more , at the same time cutting speed nearly to hover so we could search with care through the vision port . We were heading over one of the valleys , which was roughly halfmoon-shaped . At the upper point of that were the first trees ( if trees one might term them ) I had yet seen on Sekhmet . At least they were growths of very dark foliage which stood well above bush level . But the rest of the ground was covered only with the gray tough grass .  | " There ! " There was no need for anyone to point it out  --  for it was as visible as if painted scarlet . A flitter stood in grass as high as its hatch . But there were no signs of life about it . The pilot had been calling on his com , trying to raise an answer . As yet he made no move to set down . I did not wonder at his caution . There was something about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ machine so plainly in sight , which chilled me . " Do you pick them up ? " I asked Maelen . " There is no one right here . " By that she seemed to contradict her earlier report . " But you said ? " " It is not them . Something else ? " Her thought-send faltered , almost as if she were now confused , unable to sense clearly . And my uneasiness , which had been triggered by the sight of the parked flitter , was fed by a suspicion that perhaps this was what Maelen had obliquely warned me of earlier , that she could no longer be sure of her powers . " Snooper picks up nothing , " the pilot reported . " I do n't get any ident reading . By all tests there 's no one aboard . " " Only one way to make sure , " commented the Patrolman at the port-side defense . " Set down and look . " " I do n't like it . Looks almost as if it were put out for someone to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had not yet gone to the controls . " Bait ? " That was a possibility one could readily accept . Though who would be using such bait ? With the Patrol insignia plain on our own craft , it would be top risk for anyone to spring a trap . Perhaps my faith in the force of the Patrol  | was right , for we did come down . Though both gunners stayed at their posts as we flattened the high grass not too far from the parked flitter . The grass was not only close to chest-high , but tough and sharp-edged , cutting any hand put out to beat it down . Yet it also gave us a clue as to what might have happened to the two we sought . For the flitter was empty of any passengers . Not only that , but their supply packs were still stowed within , as if Sharvan and Hunold had never expected to leave the flyer for long . Out from the trampled and crushed section of grass immediately around the hatch a trail led straight for the stand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though it might have been made by the transportation of heavy cargo . Yet here and there along it tougher patches of stem and leaf were lifting again . I searched the flitter carefully , triggering its report tape . But that repeated nothing more in its last recording than a description of what we ourselves had seen during our morning 's passage over the broken lands . Then it stopped in mid-word , the rest of the tape as bare as if it had been erased . For this I had no explanation at all . Whatever had brought them to land here remained a mystery . Still , all the instruments were in working order . I was able to apply full power and raise to a good height in testing before I set down again . There had been no failure of the craft to force a landing . As I made my examination one of the Patrol gunners and the pilot , Ilarkon , went for some distance down the trail leading to the trees . Maclen remained behind , hunkered  | down at the edge of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hatch I had one question for her . " How long ? " She sniffed the ground in the trampled space , using glassia gifts now . " More than a day . Perhaps as long as they have been missing . I can not be too sure . Krip  --  there is a strange scent here  --  human . Come ? " A swing of her head beckoned me to one side and there she used the unsheathed claws of one forepaw to pull aside the tall grass . The tuft did not come easily and I put out my mittened hands to help . Then I found the vegetation had been woven into a blind , forming a screen about a space where the ground had been grubbed clear . Upon the patch of soil was the impression of a square which might have been left by a heavy box . I had knelt to examine this depression as the Patrolmen returned . Harkon joined me . He held a small detect and I heard a revealing chatter from that . " Small residue of radiation . Could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he commented . Then he studied the woven grass curtain . " Well hidden  --  this could not have been spotted from above at all . They could even have produced engine failure and at the same time blotted out a distress signal ? " " But why ? " " You people have already claimed sabotage . Well , if your men had reached the beacon they could have spoiled any game to be played here . It was only by chance we picked up your space call , one chance in five hundred ,  | really . Whoever is in hiding here could not have foreseen that . Or even that your corn-tech had the knowledge and equipment to try it . If they have a reason to keep you pinned here , the first step would be to cut you off from the beacon . And they must believe that by taking your flitter , they have done that effectively . And as to who they ' are ? " He shrugged . " You ought to have some guess . " " Outside of jacks with inside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sharvan and Hunold ? " I meant that question as much for Maelen as Harkon , and I thought she might have the more reliable answer . " They were alive when they left here , " she replied . " No attempt made to conceal the trail . I do n't think they believed anyone would be after them in a hurry , " Harkon replied when I passed along Maelen 's report . " You have this much reassurance , " he added . " The Free Traders ' loyalty to their own is a known fact . They might keep your men alive to bargain with . " " Exchange . " I nodded . " But we have had no offers ? nothing . No one we could detect has been near the Lydis . " " Which is not to say that they wo n't show up with a ransom deal sooner or later . " I arose , brushing the dead grass wisps from my thermo suit . " Maybe not now . Not if they saw your ship land . " Yet jacks are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take as the Lydis 's cargo to consider . The Patrol ship was a Scout , and it had gone off-world again . Three Patrolmen in an armed flitter , and the reduced crew of the Lydis ? This might be the very time the enemy would select to make such a move , if they did have us under observation . I said as much .  | " We 'll follow the trail to the woods anyway , " Harkon answered . " If there 's nothing beyond " ? he shrugged again ? " nothing to do then but wait for reinforcements . We ca n't stand up to a jack gang with only three men . " I noted that he apparently did not class the Free Traders as part of his fighting force . But perhaps to the Patrol any outside their own close company was not to be so considered . Just another of the things which made them less than popular . We left one gunner on guard and tramped along the grass track once more , Maelen with me now , Harkon ahead , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near that wood I saw that the growths could indeed be termed trees , but they lacked any attraction , their limbs being twisted and coiled as if they had once been supple tentacles flung out in a wild attempt to embrace something and had solidified in such ungainly positions . The leaves were very dark and thick-fleshed , and there were not many to a limb . But they were still able to form a heavy canopy which shut out that pallid sunlight and made the way ahead a tunnel of deep dusk . But the path we followed did not enter there . Instead it turned left to run along the edge of the stand . Here there was little grass , but the gray soil showed scrapes and scuffs , being too soft to retain sharp prints . Having skirted the woods , the way came to the very point of the valley . Maelen , who had paced by my side , drew away to the sharp rise of the cliff . She sat up on her haunches , her head swaying a little ; she might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wall , so intently did she regard it . I took a  | couple of strides to join her , but I could see nothing , though I searched , believing that she must have come upon something such as the cat mask . " What is it now ? " I ventured to break her concentration . For the first time she made no answer . Her mind was closed as tight as any defense gate barred to the enemy . Still she stared , her head turning a fraction right , left , right again . But I could detect nothing to keep her so scanning stone . " What is it ? " Harkon echoed my question . " I do n't know . Maelen does not answer . " I touched the raised crest on her head . She drew back from even that small physical contact . Nor did she open her mind or show that she was aware of me . Never before had this happened . " Maelen ! " I made of her name a challenge , a demand for attention . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That fear she had implanted in me , the suggestion that she might surrender to her beast body , was sharp . ' Then that swinging of the head , the unblinking stare , broke . I saw her red tongue flick out , lick her muzzle . Both her forepaws scraped upward along the sides of her head in a gesture which aped the human . She might have been trying to close her ears to some sound she could no longer stand , which was racking her with pain . " Maelen ! " I went to my knees . Our eyes were now nearly level . Putting out my hand , I caught those paws holding her head , urged her face a little around to meet my gaze . She blinked and blinked again  --  almost as one rousing from sleep . " Maelen , what is the matter ? "  | There was no longer that solid barrier . Rather I was answered by a flood of confused impressions which I could not easily sort out . Then she steadied her chain of thought . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here ! " " Danger ? " " Yes  --  at least to me . But not from those we seek . There is something else . It has prowled at the edge of my thoughts since first we set foot on this dark world . Krip , if I do not take care there is that here which can claim me ! I am Thassa  --  I am mistress ? " I felt she did not say that to me , but repeated the words to herself to steady her control . " I am Thassa ! " " You are Thassa ! " Straightway I hastened to say that , as if merely repeating my conviction would be a life line thrown to one struggling against dire danger . She dropped her forepaws to earth . Now her whole body was shaken by great shudders , such as might result from violent weeping . I dared to touch her again , and when , this time , she did not repulse me , I drew her close for such companionship as that hold might give her . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought firm . " As you will ever be ! Nothing else can claim you here . It can not ! " " What is the matter ? " Harkon 's hand was on my shoulder , giving me a small shake as if to summon my attention . " I do not know . " I told him the truth . " There is something here that threatens esper powers . " " Harkon ! " The other Patrolman , who had gone along the cliff , now stepped away from it . " Set-down marks here . A flitter  --  big one by the looks of them . "  | Harkon went to see ; I remained with Maelen . She had turned her head , was nuzzling against my jacket in an intimacy she had never before displayed . " Good  --  good to have you here , " her thought came . " Keep so , Krip , keep so with me . I must not be less nor other than I am  --  I must not ! But it is calling  --  it is calling me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is like something which wishes help that only I can offer . Yet I also know that if I do go to it ? then I am no longer me . And I will not be not-Maelen ! Never while I live will I be not-Maelen ! " The force of that was like a shout of defiance . " No one but Maelen . Tell me how I can aid . I am here ? " I gave her quickly what I had to offer . " Remember Maelen , Krip , remember Maelen ! " I guessed what she wanted and built in my mind the picture I liked to remember best of all  --  of Maelen as I had first seen her at the Great Fair in Yrjar , serene , sure , mistress of herself , untroubled , proud of her little furred people as they performed before the awed townsfolk . That was Maelen as she would always be for mc . " Did you indeed see me so , Krip ? I think you draw a picture larger and more comely , more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have given me that to hold to . Keep it ever for me , Krip . When I need it  --  have it safe ! " Harkon was back . " Nothing more to do here . " His tone was impatient . " We had better head back . They lifted in a flitter , all right , which means they can be anywhere on this continent . Can you pilot your own flyer ? "  | I nodded , but looked to Maelen . Was she ready , able , to return ? She wriggled in my hold and I loosed her . Perhaps she was well pleased to be on the move again . She scrambled into the flitter , curled up in the second seat as I settled in front of the controls . The Patrol flitter headed straight back toward the Lydis and I matched its speed . Maelen , curled still , seemed to sleep . At least she made no attempt at mind-touch . However , we were not to be long without a new problem . My corn clicked and I snapped it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was Harkon 's terse demand . I had been so absorbed with Maelen I had not thought of sending any report to the Lydis . Now I pressed the broadcast button . There was a hum  --  the beam was open . But when I punched out our code call I got no answer . Surprised , I tried again . The beam was open ; reception should have been easy . Surely with us out on search the ship 's receiver would have been constantly manned . Still no reply . I reported my failure to Harkon , to be answered with a stark " Same here . " We had set out in early morning , eating our midday meal of concentrates as we flew . Now began a fading of the pallid sunlight , a thickening and indrawing of the clouds . Also the winds were rising . For safety 's sake we both rose well above the rocky hills . There was no way we could be lost  --  the guide beam would pull us to the Lydis  --  but strong winds might make a blind landing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to be blind . They would be expecting us , have floodlights out to guide us down . Or  | would they ? They did not answer  --  would they even know we were coming ? Why did I get no answer ? I continued to click out the code call , pausing now and then to count to ten or twenty , praying for an answer which would end my rising suspicion that something was very wrong .  | It was hard to fight this thing which had come upon me in the valley where we found the flitter . Never had I been so shaken , so unsure of myself , of what I was  --  of who I was . Yet I could not even remember clearly now that which had flowed in upon my mind , possessing my thoughts , struggling to eject my identity . I know shape-changing , who better ? But this was no ordered way of Thassa doing . This had been a concentrated attempt to force me to action which was not of my own planning . As I crouched low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was still trying to draw about me , as one might draw a ragged cloak against the stabbing air of winter , my confidence and belief in my own powers . What I had met there I could not trace to its source and did not know  --  save that I wanted no more of it ! I was thus so intent upon my own misery and fear that I was not wholly aware of Krip 's actions . Until his thought came piercing my self-absorption in a quick , clean thrust .  | " Maelen ! They do not reply from the Lydis . What can you read ? " Read ? For a moment even his mind-send seemed to be in a different language , one beyond my comprehension . Then I drew heavily on my control , forced my thought away from that dire contact in the valley . Lydis  --  the Lydis did not answer ! But at least now I had a concrete focus for my search . I was not battling the unknown . Though the ship itself , being inanimate , would not act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be best for that . I pictured in my mind the cargomaster , loosed my tendril of seek What I encountered was a blank . No  --  below the surface of nothingness there pulsed something , a very muted sense of identity . I have mind-sought when those I so wished to touch were asleep , even in deep unconsciousness produced by illness . This present state was like unto the last , save that it was even deeper , farther below the conscious level . Lidj was not to be reached by any seek of mine . I transferred then to Korde  --  with the same result . " They are unconscious  --  Lidj and Korde  --  deeply so , " I reported . " Asleep ! " " Not true sleep . I have reported it as it is . They are not conscious , nor do they dream , nor are their minds open to under-thought as they are in true sleep . This is something else . " I tried to probe deeper , to awaken some response , enough to win information . But even as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if I had been pushing toward a goal when about me rose a trapping net . This net had the same feel  | as that which had entranced me for a space in the valley . Save that this time it was stronger , held me more rigidly in its bonds , as if another personality , stronger , more compelling , had joined with the first to bind and draw me . I could see Krip and the flitter . I could look down at my own furred body , at my forepaws , from which the striking claws were now protruding as if I were preparing to do battle . But between me and that sane outer world there was building a wall of haze . Maelen  --  I was Maelen ! " Krip , think me Maelen as you did in the valley ! Make me see myself as I truly am , have been all my life , no matter what body I now wear . I am Maelen ! " However , my plea must not have reached him . I was dimly aware of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noise but no meaning . Maelen  --  with all my strength of mind and will I held to my need of identity , besieged by rising waves of force , each beating upon me stronger than the last . Dimly I thought this a worse peril because I was one who had been able to change the outward coverings of my spirit  --  something which made me the more susceptible to whatever abode here . But  --  I was Maelen  --  not Vors , no one else  --  only Maelen of the Thassa . Now my world had narrowed to that single piece of knowledge , which was my shield , or my weapon . Maelen as Krip had seen me in his memory . Though , as I had told him , I had never been so fair , so strong as that . Maelen All beyond me was gone now . I closed my outer eyes lest I be disturbed from my defense . For how long I continued  | then to hold Maelen intact I do not know , as time was no longer broken down into any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I feared weakening more than any bodily death . That assault grew in strength , reached such a height that I knew if it advanced I could not hold . Then  --  it began to fail . With failure there came a secondary current , first of raging impatience , then of fear and despair . This time also I had held fast . That I could do so a third time with this strange power fighting against me , I doubted . And Kripwhere had Krip been ? What of his promise that he would stand with me ? Anger born of my great fear flared hot in me . Was this the true worth of what I might expect from him , that in my hour of greatest need he would leave me to fight a lone battle ? The influence which had tested me this second time was now gone , the remnants winking out as a lamp might give way to the dark . I was left so drained that I could not move , even once I had returned to an awareness of what lay about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the flitter . But the flyer was on the ground . I could see from the vision port the fins of the Lydis , though the hulk of the ship towered far above us . " Krip ? " Weakly I tried to reach him . Tried  --  hut what I met was that same nothingness which I had encountered when I had sought Lidj and Korde ! I pulled up on the seat , edged around to look directly into his face . His eyes were open ; he stared straight ahead . I reached  | out a forepaw , caught at his shoulder . His body was rigid , as if frozen , a piece of carving rather than blood , flesh , and bone ! Had he been caught in that same net which had tried to encompass me , but more securely ? I began to fight again , this time to reach that which lay beneath the weight of nothingness . But I was too weakened by my own ordeal  --  I could not win to that secret place where Krip Vorlund had been imprisoned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rigid , frozen , staring with eyes I did not believe saw anything of the outer world . I scrambled off the seat , clumsily freed the catch of the door hatch with my paws . Though the fins of the Lydis were bulky enough to show through the dark , the rest of the valley was well hidden in night shadows . I dropped over the edge of the hatch into the soft sand , which puffed up around my haunches , cushioning me by the edge of a dune . The hatch closed automatically behind me . Krip had not noticed my going , made no effort to join me . Standing in the shadow cast by the flitter , I surveyed the valley . There was no boarding ramp out from the Lydis . She was locked tight , as we had kept her during each night on Sekhmet . Beyond the fins was the Patrol flitter . Around that was no stir . I padded through the sand to reach its side . There was a faint glow within , the radiance of the instrument panel , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no leapers . Now I made a great effort , putting all I could into a jump which allowed me to hook my claws over the edge of the port , hang there long enough with a straining of my shoulder muscles for a look within .  | The pilot occupied his seat with the same rigidity Krip displayed . His nearest companion was in position by the weapon , also frozen at his post . I could only see the back of the head of the second gunner , but since he did not move , I believed I could assume he was in a like state . Both the pilot and Krip had made good landings here , but now they seemed as truly prisoners as if they were chained in some dungeon in Yrjar . Prisoners of whom  --  and why ? Still , since they had landed their flitters in safety , it was plain that the enemy did not yet want them dead , only under control . That they would be left so for long , I doubted . And prudence suggested that I get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learned more of the situation . I might already be under surveillance from some point in the valley . I began to test mind-seek  --  only to find it limited , so drawn upon by the ordeal I had been through that I dared not try it far . For the time being I was reduced to depending upon the five senses inherent in my present body . Though it disturbed me to rely on the glassia abilities , I relaxed my vigilance and my control of my body , raised my head so that my nose could test the scents in the air , listened as intently as I could , tried to see as much among the shadows as my eyes would allow . The glassia are not nocturnal . Their night vision is probably but little better than a man 's . But the contrast of the light-gray sand with the flitters and the tall bulk of the Lydis was enough to give me my bearings . And if I could reach the cliff wall , its rugged formation would offer me hiding in plenty . I squatted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a route which would give me maximum cover .  | Perhaps I was wasting time ; perhaps the valley was not under observation and I could have walked boldly enough . But that was too chancy . So I covered the ground with all the craft I could summon , alert to any sight or noise which could mean I was betrayed . Then I found a crevice I thought was promising . It was so narrow that I must back into it . Within that I crouched , lying low , my head resting on my paws , taking up vigil to watch the ship and the two flitters . As during that pallid day before , the clouds parted a little . There were stars to be seen , but no moon . I thought with longing of the bright glow of Sotrath , which gave such light to Yiktor , filling the night with blazing splendor . Stars above me  --  or were they ? For a beast , distances are altered , angles of vision changed . Not stars  --  lights ! Those lower ones at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Three I counted . And in that direction was the spot where we had cached the cargo . With the crew and the Patrolmen caught now , were those mysterious others we suspected to be at the root of our troubles working to loot the treasure ? Having established the presence of the lights , I caught something else which came through the rocks about me  --  a vibration . Nothing stirred in the valley , there was no sign of any watcher . Perhaps whoever had set this trap had been so confident of its holding for as long as necessary that no sentry had been posted . I squirmed uneasily . I did not in the least want to do what I thought must be done  --  go to see if my suspicions were correct , that the cache was being looted  --  to see who was responsible . Stubbornly I hunkered in what seemed to me now to be a shell of safety , one I would be worse than foolish to leave .  | I owed no allegiance to the Lydis . I was no Free Trader @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tie between us I had no thought or wish to break . But for the rest ? Yet Krip had as strong ties to them , so I was bound to their fate whether I would or no . Could a glassia have sighed , I would have done so then as I most reluctantly crawled out of my safe little pocket and began to pad along at the foot of the cliff , making use once more of every bit of cover . When I had gone exploring with Krip we had suited our path to the demands of his human body . But I knew I could take a much faster way up and over the heights , since my powerful claws were well fitted to climbing this rock riddled with cracks and crevices . I worked my way around until I reached a spot which I thought directly in line with those lights . There I began to climb . The rock face was dark enough so that my black fur would not show against its surface as it would have on the light dunes . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to irregularities which served me well . I made better speed at this than I had skulking about on the ground , and so managed to pull out on top of the ridge hardly winded by my efforts . From this vantage point I could see my suspicions were in part true . Three lights , giving from here a greater glow of illumination , were at the point where Foss and the others had thought they had so well hidden the cargo . Yet the effort of breaking through the plug they had left there could not be an easy one . I guessed from the vibration in the rocks , and a faint purr of sound now to be heard , that some machine had been brought in to handle that task .  | So intent had I been on that distant work I was not at first aware of what lay closer . Not until I moved a little aside and edged against that beam ? Shock struck me with the power of a blow . Had I met it at a point of greater intensity I might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was pure force , delivered with such strength that one could believe such a beam should be visible . And it was mind force . Yet this was a concentration I had never experienced , even when our Old Ones merged their power for some needful action . That it had to do with the blanked minds of the humans below , I had no doubt at all . I was prepared now , wary , my defenses up , so that I could skirt the danger and not be once more entrapped . And that I must find the source , I also knew . I did not want a second meeting with that deadly beam , yet I must somehow keep in contact in order to trace it . So I was reduced to flinching in and out on the edge , reeling away , shuffling on to touch again . Thus I came to a niche in the rocks . There was no light there , no one around ; I summoned up enough mind-seek to make sure before I approached that pocket from the rear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was deeply set back in the niche . Finally I had to pull my way to the top of the rock pile , since I had made sure that the only opening lay at the front . Crouched with my belly flat on the arch , I clawed myself forward . Then I bent my head down , hoping that the beam did not fill the whole of the opening , that I could see what lay inside . It had seemed dark when viewed from a distance . But  | within the very narrow space was a faint glimmer , enough to reveal the occupant . I was looking , from a cramped , upside-down position , into a face ! The shock of that nearly loosed me from my precarious hold . I regained control , was able to concentrate on those set , grim features . The eyes of the stranger were shut , his face utterly expressionless , as if he slept . And his body was enclosed in a box which had been wedged upright so that he faced out over the valley . The main @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the section of cover directly over his face was clear . The face was humanoid enough , though completely hairless , without even brows or lashes . And the skin was a pale gray . The box which enclosed him ( I believed the sleeper to be male ) was equipped with a front panel which might have been transparent had not the frosted condition prevailed , for it looked like crystal . This was banded by a wide frame of metal flecked here and there with small specks of color I could not see clearly . At the foot of the box was another piece of equipment . And while the sleeper ( if sleeper he was ) resembled nothing I had seen before , what sat at his feet was familiar . I had seen its like employed only a few days ago in the Lydis . It was an amplifier for communication , such as Korde had rigged when he made the off-world distress call . Seeing it where it now was left only one inference to be drawn . The mind-blast was coming from the boxed body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , its being here could have only one purpose  --  that of holding Krip , the Patrolmen , and presumably the crew of the Lydis in thrall . Could  | I in some manner disconnect it , or abate the flow of current , they might be released . About the boxed sleeper I could do nothing . I was not strong enough to handle the case  --  it had been too tightly wedged into that niche . My eyes , adjusting to the very faint light emitted from the frame , showed that rocks had been pounded in about the large box to pin it in place . So  --  I might not get at the source of the mind-thrall , but the amplifier was another matter . I remembered well how cautiously Korde had adjusted the one on the Lydis , his constant warning that the slightest jar could deflect the line of force beam . But this was a task I had to push myself to . For , just as I had tired under my battle in the flitter with that which had tried to take over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of distress through aching muscles , fatigue-heavy limbs . I withdrew to the ground below and moved in cautiously from the side , creeping low and so hoping to elude the full force of the beam . Luckily it did not appear to sweep the ground . Having made this discovery , I found it easy to wriggle closer . I could see only one possible way , and success would depend upon just how clumsy this animal body was . Backing off , I went to look for a weapon . But here the scouring winds had done their work far too well . There were no loose stones small enough to serve me . I padded along , nosing into every hole I saw , becoming more and more desperate . If I had to return to the floor of the valley to search , I would . But I still hoped . Stubbornness rewarded me in the end , for in one of the  | hollows I found a rock which I worried at with my claws until it loosened , so that I could scrape it out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by hands , it is difficult to use one 's mouth . But I got the rock between my teeth and returned . Once more I edged in as flat as I could , and with the stone between my teeth I hammered away at the top of the amplifier , until that was so battered I did not believe those who had left it could ever use it again . I did not approach the box of the sleeper . But from that seeped a dank chill , like the worst blast of highland winter I had ever met on Yiktor . I believed that had I set paw to that frosted front , I might well have frozen a limb by that unwary touch . There was no change in the face , which could have been that of a carvcn statue . Yet the sleeper lived , or had once lived . Looking up at the entombed stirred a confused feeling in me . Quickly I not only glanced away from those set features , but also backed out of the line of sight of the closed eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the flitter  --  I felt a stirring of that . And the sensation caused such alarm in me that I loped away without heeding the direction of my going . When I had my emotions once more under control , and that hint of troubling influence was gone , I discovered I had headed not back to the ship valley but toward the lights and the purr of sound . It might be well for me to scout that scene of activity . I hoped that now that the broadcast had been stopped , those in the I , ydis and flitters would be free . And it could be to their advantage if I were able to supply information upon my return .  | The strangers had no guards or sentries about . Perhaps they were so certain of that which they had put to work in the heights that they felt safe . And it was easy enough to slip up to a good vantage point . Busy at the cache they were , with flares lighting the scene , brighter even than Sekhmet 's daylight . Robos , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we had set to seal the crevice . But the Traders had done so good a job there that the machines were not breaking it down in any hurry . They had various tools , flamers , and the like fitted into their work sockets and were attacking the fused stone with vigor . The robos of the Lydis were mainly for loading , although in extreme need they could be equipped with a few simple working tool modifications . These looked larger and different . They were being directed to their labor by a man holding a control board . And , though I knew little of such machines , I thought they seemed chiefly intended for excavation work . As far as we of the Lydis knew , there were no mines on Sekhmet . And casual prospectors did not own such elaborate and costly machines . We had found traces of what might be treasure deposits here . Could these robos have been imported to open such deposits ? The men below  --  there were three of them  --  looked like any spacers , wearing the common coveralls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same stock as the Free Traders . The two who were not controlling the robos carried weapons , blasters to be exact , an indication that they could well be outside the law . The sight of those was warning enough for me to keep my distance .  | I stiffened against the ground , my breath hissing between those fangs which were a glassia 's natural weapons . A fourth man had come into sight . And his face was very clear in the flare lamps . It was Griss Sharvan ! There were no signs of his being a prisoner . He stopped beside one of the guards , watching the robos with as much interest as if he had set them to work . Had he ? Was it Sharvan who had led this crew to the cache ? But why ? It was very hard for anyone who knew the Traders to believe that one of them could turn traitor to his kind . Their loyalty was inbred . I would have sworn by all I knew that such a betrayal was totally impossible . Yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looters . From time to time the robo master made adjustments on the controls . I caught a feeling of impatience from him . And when that reached my conscious attention , I thought that the weakening of my power had passed . Which meant I might just dare to discover , via mind-probe , what Sharvan did here . Settling myself to the easiest position I could find , I began probe .  | It was very quiet ; there was no thrum in the walls , no feeling of the usual safe containment which a ship gave . I opened my eyes  --  but not upon the walls of my cabin in the I , ydis ; instead I was facing the control board of a flitter . And as I blinked , more than a little bemused , recollection flowed in . The last thing I could remember clearly was flying over the broken ranges on my way back to the ship . But I was not flying now . Then how had I landed , and I turned to look at the second seat . There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me that I was alone in the flitter . Yet surely Maelen could not have landed us . And the dark outside was now that of night . It took only an instant or two to open the hatch and stumble out of the flyer . Beside me rose the Lydis . Beyond her I could make out a second flitter . But why could I not remember ? What had happened just before we landed ? " Vorlund ! " My name out of the night . " Who 's there ? "  | " Harkon . " A dark shadow came from the other flitter , plowed through the sand toward me . " How did we get here ? " he demanded . But I could not give him any answer to that . There was a grating sound from the ship . I raised my head to see the ramp issue from her upper hatch like a tongue thrust out to explore . Moments later its end thudded to earth only a short distance away . But I was more intent on finding Maelen . The sand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a trail . But if the ship 's ramp had been up , she could not have gone aboard . I could not imagine what would have taken her away from the flitter . Except her strange actions back in that other valley made me wonder if some influence had drawn her beyond her powers of resistance . If so , what influence , and why would it affect her more here ? Also , I could not remember landing the flitter I flashed out a mind-seek . And an instant later I reeled back , striking against the body of the flitter I had just quitted , going to my knees , my hands against my head , unable to think clearly , gasping for breath  --  for By the time Harkon reached me I must have been very close to complete blackout . I recall only dimly being led on board the Lydis , people moving about me . Then I choked , gasped , shook my head as strong fumes cut through the frightening mist which was between me and the world . I looked up , able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bay of the ship . Medic Lukas was by me , backed by Lidj and IIarkon . " What  --  what happened ? " " You tell us , " Lukas said .  | My head  --  I turned it a little on the pillow . That sickening wave of assaulting blackness mixed with pain ebbed . " Maelen  --  she was gone . I tried to find her by mind-seek . Then  --  something hit  --  inside my head . " It was as hard now to describe the nature of that attack as it was to remember how I had come earlier to land the flitter . " It agrees . " Lukas nodded . But what agreed with what , no one explained to me . Until he continued , " Esper force stepped up to that degree can register as energy . " He shook his head . " I would have said it was impossible , except on one world or another the impossible is often proved true . " " Esper , " I repeated . My head ached now , with a degree of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about her ? But perhaps to try mind-seek again would bring another such attack , and that dread was realized as Lukas continued : " Keep away from the use of that , Krip . At least until we know more of what is happening . You had such a dose of energy that you were nearly knocked out . " " Maelen  --  she 's gone ! " He did not quite meet my eyes then . I thought I could guess what he was thinking . " She was n't responsible ! I know her sending ? " " Then who did ? " Harkon demanded . " You stated from the start that she is highly telepathic . Well , this is being done by a telepath of unusual talent and perhaps training . And I would like to know who landed us here  --  since we can not remember ! Were we taken over by your animal ? " " No ! " I struggled to sit up , and then doubled over , fighting the nausea and feeling of disorientation that move-  | ment caused . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a tube , swallowing cool liquid which allayed the sickness . " It was not Maelen ! " I got out when I finished that potion . " You can not mistake a mind sending  --  it is as individual as a voice , a face . This  --  this was alien . " Now that I had had a few moments in which to think about it , I knew that was true . " Also " ? Lukas turned to Lidj ? " tell them what registered on our receivers here . " " We have a recording , " the cargomaster began . " This esper attack began some time ago  --  and you were not here then . It broke in intensity about a half hour since  --  dropped far down the scale , though it still registers . Just as if some transmission of energy had been brought to a peak and then partly shut off . While it was on at the top range none of us can remember anything . We must have awakened , if you can term it that , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apparently enough to knock out anyone trying esper communication , as Krip proved . So if it was not Maelen ? " " But where is she now ? " I swallowed experimentally as I raised my head , and discovered I felt better . " I was alone in the flitter when I awoke  --  and no one can find a trail through that sand out there . " " It may be that she has gone to hunt the source of what hit us . She is a far greater esper than any of our breed , " Lidj suggested . I pulled myself up , pushing away Lukas 's hand when he put it out to deter me . " Or else she was drawn unwillingly . She felt something back there in that valley where we found  | the flitter , she begged me to get her away . She  --  she may have been caught by whatever is there ! " " It is not going to help her to go charging out without any idea of what you may be up against . " Lidj @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but since he , Lukas , and Harkon made a barrier at the door of the sick bay I was sure I was not going to get past them at present . " If you think I am going to stay safe in here while ? " I began . Lidj shook his head . " I am only saying that we have to know more about the enemy before we go into battle . We have had enough warning to be sure that this is something we have never faced before . And what good will it do Maelen , Sharvan , or Hunold if we too are captured before we can aid them ? " " What are you doing ? " I demanded . " We have a fix on the source of the broadcast , or whatever it is . On top of the cliff to the east-northeast . But in the middle of the night we are n't going to get far climbing around these rocks hunting for it . I can tell you this much ? it registers with too regular a pattern to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which we can believe , working on a telepath 's level  --  then there should be someone in charge of it . Someone who probably knows this country a lot better than we do . But we have our range finder out now ? " " And something else , " Harkon cut in crisply . " I loosed a snooper , set on the recording pattern , as soon as Lidj reported this . That will broadcast back a pick-up picture when it locates anything which is not just rock and brush . " " So ? " Lidj spoke again . " Now we shall adjourn to the control cabin and see what the snooper can tell us. "  | The Patrol are noted for their use of sophisticated equipment . They have refinements which are far ahead of those on Free Trader ships . I had heard of snoopers , though I had never seen one in action before . There was a flutter on the surface of the small screen set over the visa-plate of the Lydis  --  a rippling of lines . But that continued without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said was unfortunately true . If I could not use mind-seek without provoking such instant retaliation as before , I had little chance of finding Maelen in that broken country , especially at night . " Something coming in ! " IIarkon 's voice broke through my dark imaginings . Those fluttering lines on the screen were overlaid with a pattern . As we watched , the faint image sharpened into a definite scene . We looked into a dark space where an arching of rocks made a niche . And the niche was occupied . It was the face of the man or being who stood there which riveted my attention first . Human  --  or was he ? His eyes were closed as if he slept  --  or concentrated . Then the whole of the scene registered . He was not in the open , but rather enclosed in a box which , except for the space before his face , was opaque . That box had been wedged upright , so he faced outward . At his feet was a smaller box . But this was broken , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through cracks in it . Harkon spoke first . " I think we can see why the broadcast suddenly failed . That thing in front is an alpha-ten amplifier , or was before someone gave it a good bashing . It 's meant to project and heighten corn relays . But I never  | heard of it being used to amplify telepathic sends before . " " That man , " Lidj said as if he could not quite believe what he saw . " Then he is a telepath and his mind-send was so amplified . " " A telepath to a degree hitherto unknown , I would say , " Lukas replied . " There 's something else  --  he may be humanoid , but he 's not of Terran stock . Unless of a highly mutated strain . " " How do you know ? " Harkon asked for all of us . " Because he 's plainly in stass-freeze . And in that state you do n't broadcast ; you are not even alive , as we reckon life . " He glanced at us as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for one , knew Lukas was never given to wild and unfounded statements . If he thought that closedeyed stranger was in stass-freeze , I would accept his diagnosis . Harkon shook his head slowly . Not as if he were prepared to argue with Lukas , but as if he could not honestly accept what he was seeing . " Well , if he is in stass-freeze , at least he 's tight in that box . He did not get there on his own . Somebody put him there . " " How about the snooper  --  can it pick up any back trail from that ? " Lidj gestured to the screen . " Show us who installed the esper and the amplifier ? " " We can see what a general life-force setting will do . " Harkon studied the dial of his wrist corn , made a delicate adjustment to it . The screen lost the picture with a flash and the fluttering returned . " It is n't coming back , " Harkon reported , " so the life-  | force search must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up ? " " Getting something ! " Korde leaned forward , half cutting off my view of the screen , so I pulled him back a little . He was right . Once more there was a scene on the screen . We were looking into a much brighter section of countryside . " The cache  --  they 're looting the cache ! " But we did not need that exclamation from Lidj . There were excavation robos busy there . And they had broken through the plug we had thought the perfect protection . Three  --  no , four  --  men stood a little to one side watching the work . Two were armed with blasters , one had a robo control board . But the fourth man I saw Lidj hunch farther toward the screen . " I  --  do n't  --  believe  --  it ! " His denial was one we could have voiced as a chorus . I knew Griss Sharvan ; I had shared planet leave with him . He had been with me on Yiktor when first I had seen Maelen . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the looting of our cargo . He was a Free Trader , born and bred to that life  --  and among us there were no traitors ! " He can only be mind-washed ! " Lidj produced the one explanation we could accept . " If an esper of the power Krip met got at him , it 's no wonder they could find the cache . They could pick its hiding place right out of his brain ! And they must have Ilunold , too . But what are they ? jacks ? " He asked that of Ilarkon , depending upon the authority of one who should know his lawbreakers to give him an answer . " Jacks  --  with such equipment ? They do n't make such  | elaborate efforts in their operations . I would think more likely a Guild job ? " " Thieves ' Guild here ? " Lidj had a good right to his surprise . The Thieves ' Guild was powerful , as everyone knew . But they did not operate on the far rim of the galaxy . Theirs was not the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Those small pickings were left to the jacks . The Guild planned bigger deals based on inner planets where wealth gathered , drawn in from those speculative ventures on the worlds the jacks plundered . If jacks had dealings with the Guild it was only when they fenced their take with the more powerful criminals . But they were very small operators compared with the members of that spider web which was , on some worlds , more powerful than the law . The Guild literally owned planets . " Guild , or perhaps Guild-subsidized . " Harkon held to his point stubbornly . Which made our own position even more precarious , though it would also account for the sabotage and the elaborate plan which seemed to have been set up to enmesh the Lydis , both in space and here . The Guild had resources which even the Patrol could not guess . They were rumored to be ready to buy up , or acquire by other , more brutal means , new discoveries and inventions , so that they might keep ahead of their opponents . The boxed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a Guild weapon . And the mining robos we saw at work here I thought at once of that cat mask on the cliff , of Maelen 's assurance that other finds existed . Suppose some enterprising jack outfit , ambitious and far-seeing , had made  | the discovery that Sekhmet had such finds . With such a secret as their portion of the partnership , they could get Guild backing . At least to the extent of modern excavation equipment , plus such devices as the esper linkage for protection . Then one of their men on Thoth could have picked up the news of our cargo . And they might have prepared to gather that in as a bonus . The Throne of Qur would be worth any effort . I could not help but believe that was the answer . But what other devices could they have ? That which sabotaged the Lydis we still do not understand . And the esper was something entirely new . Nor were the Free Traders backward in hearing about such things . " Look out ! " I was startled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could still see the scene of the cargo cache . The robos had started to bring out what we had stored there . But it was not that action which the Patrol pilot had noted . One of the guards had turned about , was pointing his blaster directly at our screen . A moment later that went black . " Took out the snooper , " IIarkon commented . " Now they know  --  first , that their esper is no longer controlling us ; second , that we have learned of their activities in turn , " Lidj said . " Do we now expect an attack in force ? " " What arms do you carry ? " IIarkon asked . " No more than are allowed . We can break our seal on the ordnance compartment and get the rest of the blasters . That 's the extent of it . A Trader depends on evasive action  | in space . And the Lydis does not set down on worlds where the weapons are much more sophisticated than on Thoth . We have n't broken that seal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what they have  --  could be anything , " Harkon commented . " I wonder who took out that amplifier . Might that man of yours be operating on his own  --  the one you did not see ? " But I was as certain as if I had witnessed the act . " Maelen did that . " " An animal  --  even a telepathic one ? " Harkon began . I eyed him coldly . " Maelen is not an animal . She is a Thassa , a Moon Singer of Yiktor . " The odds were that he had not the slightest idea of what that meant , so I enlarged on that statement . " She is an alien , wearing animal form only for a time . It is a custom among her people . " I was determined not to go farther into that . " She would be perfectly capable of tracing the esper interference and knocking out the amplifier . " But where was she now ? Had she gone on to the cache to see what was happening there ? I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off so accurately . They were programmed to evade attack . He could have been just as quick to dispose of Maelen , had he sighted her . They had probably been planeted on Sekhmet long enough to know most of the native wildlife , so they would have recognized her even in animal form as something from off-world , and been suspicious . I could imagine plainly the whole sequence of such a discovery . If only I dared mind-search ! But even though the amplifier was not of use , I knew I could once more bring upon myself that force I had experienced earlier . Until the stass-  | frozen man  --  or thing  --  was rendered harmless ( if he could be ) I had no hope of tracking Maelen except by sight alone . And in the dark of night that was impossible . " We can just sit it out , " Korde was saying when I again paid attention . " Your ship " ? he nodded to Harkon ? " will be back soon with Foss . We have power enough to warn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lidj was shaking his head . " Not good enough . The jacks must have been watching us all along , even if we could not detect them  --  they certainly possess a protective field which blanks out even esper when they want , or Maelen would have picked them up earlier . So they know about us and that we are waiting for help . They could move fast now  --  pack up and be off-world before we get reinforcements . After all , their base may be half this continent away , hidden anywhere . We 've got to keep on their tails if we can . But it wo n't do any good to try another snooper . They will be watching for that now . " " We have n't one anyway , " IIarkon commented dryly . " For the rest , I would say you arc right . There is also this ? if we stay in or around your ship , they may be able to pin us down , blank out any corn warning , hold us just as tightly as they did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guard and a locked-up boarding ramp . The rest of us will take to the country . It is rough enough to hide an army . We 'll work our way northeast , starting at the cache , and see if we can at least locate the general direction of their base . They wo n't be able to transport all they are pulling out of there without making a number of trips . Also  --  that esper is still up there . If we find him before they come to see what is wrong , we may just be able to shut him off , or do whatever needs to be  | done to hinder them in using him again . And what about this Maelen of yours  --  can you contact her , find out where she is ? " He spoke directly to me . " Not as long as that esper is broadcasting . You saw what happened when I tried that before . But I think she is near that cache . It may be that if I get close enough she can perhaps pick me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is far more powerful than I am . " " Good . That makes you our first choice for the scouting force . " He certainly did not wait for volunteers . Not that I would not have been the first of those . But a Free Trader does not take kindly to any assumption of authority except from his own kind . And it was very apparent that Harkon considered himself without question to be the leader of any sortie we planned . Lidj might have challenged him , but he did not . He went instead to break the seal on the arms locker . We took out the blasters , inserted fresh charges , slung on ammunition belts . E rations were in packets . And we had our thermo suits as protection against the chill . In the end Korde and Aljec Lalfarns , a tubeman , stayed with the ship . Harkon 's gunners from the flitter removed the charges from those crafts ' defense to render them harmless and made ready to join us . It was still dark , though dawn could not now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ate our last full ship 's meal before we left . It was decided we would try the more arduous climb up over the cliff , so we could find the esper and take action to insure he would not trouble us again . And climb we did , the blasters on their slings over our shoulders , weighing us back , making the climb more difficult , though the face of the  | stone was already rough enough . We had had to put aside our mittens in order to find handholes , and the chill of the rock bit deep , so that we must press on as quickly as we could before any numbing of our fingers could bring about disaster . I thought of Maelen 's sharp-pointed claws and knew that this road must have been a fairly easy one for her . But her passing had left no traces . We reached the top of the cliff , spread out in a single thin line as Harkon ordered . From this height we could see the lights at the location of the cache . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And , having been alerted by the snooper , they could already be preparing a warm welcome . Our advance had been very short when my wrist corn buzzed . " To the right , " clicked the signal which brought me in that direction , picking my way more by feel than sight . Thus we gathered at the niche we had seen from the snooper . The smashed amplifier had not been moved . It was apparent that those who had installed it there either had not arrived to check on it , or had abandoned it . I stepped closer , flinched . For the first time in my life I experienced mind-send not only in my brain , but as an invisible but potent force against my body . " Do n't go directly in front of it ! " I said sharply . At my warning Harkon edged in from one side , I from the other . There was no sign of life on that face . It was humanoid , yet it had an alien cast . I might have been looking at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had I not felt that strong current of send . The Patrolman stepped back , yielding his place to Lukas . Now the medic put out  | his unmittened hand and moved his fingers , held an inch or so away from the surface of that case , as if he were smoothing it up and down . " Stass-freeze to a high degree , " he reported . " Higher than I know of in general use . " He unsealed the front of his jacket , drew out a life-force detect , and held that at the level of the sleeper 's chest , though we could not see the body through that opaque opening . In the very dim light radiated by the box I saw the incredulous expression on Lukas 's face . With a sharp jerk he brought the detect up level with the head , took a second reading , returned to heart level for another examination . Then he edged back . " What about it ? " Harkon asked . " How deep in stass is he ? " " Too deep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't be ! " I stared at the set face of the box 's occupant . " The dead do n't mind-send ! " " Maybe he does n't know that ! " Lukas gave a queer sound , almost a laugh . Then his voice steadied as he added , " He 's not only dead , but so long dead the force reading went clear out of reckoning . Think about that for a moment . "  | I still could not really believe that . A mind-send from a dead man  --  impossible ! And I said so . But Lukas waved his detect and swore that it was working properly , as he proved by trying it on me and pointing to the perfectly normal reading . We had to accept that a dead body , linked to an amplifier , had managed to keep us in thrall until the machine had been smashed ; that esper power , strong enough to upset anyone human ( I could hope Maelen was beyond its control ) who tried to use a like talent in its vicinity , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still being looted . We dared not spend too long a time with this mystery when action was demanded elsewhere . The damaged amplifier was speedily disposed of , but we could not unwedge that box . So we left the strange sleeper there , still broadcasting , as he had ? for how long ? Though I was sure not from the same site . The way over the cliffs was much shorter than the  | ground-level trail . We crept up , following all the precautions of those invading enemy territory , until we could look down at the cache . There the robos had emptied our hiding place . The glittering Throne stood in a blaze of harsh glory amid the boxes and bundles . A flitter , perhaps double the size of our own , had grounded , was being loaded with the smaller pieces . The three jacks we had seen via snooper were studying the Throne . It was plain to see that that was not going to fit into the flyer , and its transportation must present a problem . Save for those three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had disappeared . But at the moment my own concern was for Maelen . If she had come here , was she hiding somewhere among these rocks , spying as we were ? Dared I try mind-send again ? There was no other way of finding her in this rough terrain . Though one of Sekhmet 's cloudy dawns was at hand and visibility was better than it had been when we had begun this trek . I made my choice for mind-seek , ready to withdraw that instantly if I so much as brushed the edge of any deadly broadcast . But this time I met none . So heartened , I fastened upon a mind-picture of Maelen and began my quest in earnest . But I did not even meet with the betraying signal of a mind-block . She was not on the heights where we lay in hiding . Down in the valley near the cache then ? Very cautiously I began to probe below , fearing to trigger some such response as I had before . They might well have a second sleeper at the scene of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that in itself was kind of a shock . For all three of those I could see conferring about the  | Throne did not register at all . They were mind-shielded with a complete barrier against any probe . Perhaps because of the fact that they dealt with the sleeper , and only thus could they venture to use him . So there was nothing to be learned from them either . Nor did Maelen 's answer come from the valley . Having made sure of that , I began to extend my search ? choosing south , the way from which we had come when we had first discovered this place . And , as my send crept on and on , I picked up the faintest quiver of an answer ! " Where  --  where ? " I put full force into that . " ? here ? " Very faint , very far away . " ? aid  --  here ? " There could be no mistaking the urgency of her plea . But the low volume of the send was an even greater spur to action . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubt at all . And the choice I must make now was equally plain . The cargo had brought us here ; it was the responsibility of the Lydis 's crew . We were eight men against an unknown number . And there was Maelen  --  lost  --  calling for my aid . The decision as partly dictated by my Thassa body , of that I am now sure . Just as I had once feared that Jorth the barsk was stronger than Krip Vorlund the man , so now Maquad of the Thassa  --  or that small residue of him which was a part of me  --  changed my life . Thassa to Thassa  --  I could not hold out against that call . But neither would my other heritage allow me to go without telling my own kind that I must . Chance had brought me closest to Lidj . I crawled now until I could set hand on his shoulder . He jerked at my  | touch , turned to look at me . Dusky as this cloud-shrouded day was , we could see each other clearly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for aid , " I told him in a whisper which I meant to carry no farther than this spot . He said nothing , nor did any expression cross his face . I do not know what I expected , but that long , level look was one I had to force myself to meet . Though I waited , he continued silent . Then he turned away to gaze into the valley . I was chilled , cold , as if the thermo jacket had been ripped from my body , leaving my shoulders bare to the winds . Yet I could not bite back my words ; there was that in me which held me to my choice . I turned and crawled . Not only from the side of the cargomaster , but from that whole length of cliff where the others crouched waiting for Harkon 's signal to attack , if that was the order he would give . Now I had to force from me all thought of those of the Lydis . I must concentrate wholly on that thread , so thin , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thin , farstretched one it was , so tenuous I feared it would be severed and I would have no guide at all . It brought me down from the cliffs . And I could not mistake landmarks I had memorized . This was the way to the cat mask . I reached a point from which I ought to be able to see that pale and ghostly vestige of ancient carving . But this morning the light , perhaps the lack of sand to cling in the right places , did not aid me . I could trace nothing but the hollow which was its mouth .  | And Maelen 's desperate call led me there . I wriggled forward on my belly , expecting she must lie there in the shadows . But the pocket was empty ! Only her call continued  --  from beyond the wall ! With my mittened hands I pushed and beat against the blocks , certain that there must be some concealed door , that one or another of them would fall or turn to provide me with an opening . How else could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joined as if they had been set in place but weeks before . " Maelen ! " I lay there , my hands resting against the wall . " Maelen , where are you ? " " Krip  --  aid  --  aid ? " Faint , far away , a cry fast fading into nothingness . And the fear which had been riding me since first I picked up her send now struck deep into me . I was certain that if I could not find a way to her soon there would be no reason to go at all . Maelen would be gone for all time . I had but one key left to use . And by using it I might throw away a means for my own defense . But again I had no choice . I edged back , out of the mouth of that cleft . I lay flat outside , sighting inward with the blaster . Then I dropped my head to my bent arm , veiling my eyes against the brilliance of the blast I loosed as I fired . Scorching heat beat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my thermo clothing . I smelled the crisping of my mittens , felt a searing lick across the edge of my cheek . Still I held fast , giving that inner wall top power . What effect it would have on the blocks I could not tell ; I could only hope . When I had used all that charge I had yet to wait , not  | daring at once to crawl back within that cramped space until it had a little time to lose some of the heat . But neither could I wait too long . At last impatience won , and I was startled at what I found . Those blocks , which to the touch had had a likeness to the native rock of the cliff wall , were gone  --  as cleanly as if they had only been counterfeits of stone . Thus I was able to enter the passage beyond . Not that that was much larger . The cleft , or tunnel , or whatever it was , ran straight as a bore , with just enough room to wriggle . As I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I even been able to rise to my hands and knees , it would have given me a measure of relief . As it was , I had to edge on with a maximum of effort in a minimum of space . Also , the farther I went , the less I liked the idea of perhaps coming up against a dead end and having to work my way out backward . In fact , so disturbing did I find that thought that I had to banish it as quickly as I could by holding to my mental picture of Maelen . That journey seemed endless , but it was not . I used the blaster , now empty of charge , as a sounding rod , pushing it ahead of me through the dark , so feeling for any obstruction or fault which might cause trouble . And that did at last strike a solid surface . I probed with the blaster in exploration , and it seemed that the passage was firmly plugged ahead . But I must make sure , so I squirmed on until my hand came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and yet into my face blew a puff of air . Though hitherto I had not even wondered why I had been able to breathe in this tightly confined space .  | As I slipped my hands back and forth , my fingers discovered a hole , through which flowed a distinct current of air . Hooking one hand to that , I strove to dislodge the whole plug . My effort moved it , though I found I must push instead of pull . It swung away from me and I shouldered through . So I came not only to a much larger space , but to one with dim lighting . Or perhaps it was dim only in comparison with the outer world . To my eyes , used now to total dark , it seemed bright . The hole of my entrance was some distance above the floor of this other space . I entered in an awkward scramble , half falling to the lower level . It was so good to stand erect again . This chamber was square . And the light came through a series @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to my left . Save for those , there appeared to be no other opening , certainly no door . When I advanced to the light , I discovered a grating in the floor against the wall , wide enough for an exit if there were some manner of raising the grating itself . Just now I was more intent on looking through one of the slits . It was necessary to squeeze very close to that narrow opening . Even then the area of vision was much curtailed . But I was looking down into a room or hall which was of such large proportions I could view only a fraction of it . The light came from the tops of a series of standing pillars or cases . And a moment 's inspection of the nearest , though I must do that from some distance above , suggested something familiar . By almost grinding my face against the frame of the slit , I made a guess . These had a close resem-  | blance to the box which had held that dead man above the valley . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Maelen ? " Nothing moved below among the pillar-boxes . And  --  I had no answer to my call . I went on my knees , shed my charred mittens so I could lock fingers in the grating . And I had to exert all the strength I could summon before that gave , grudgingly . However , I was able to raise it . How I longed for what I did not have  --  a torch , for there was only dark below once more . Lying flat , I tried to gauge what did lie below by letting the blaster dangle from its carrying strap . Thus I discovered what appeared to be a narrow shaft , its floor not too far below . And I dared to drop to that . Once down , I explored the wall which faced the sleepers ' hall and was able to trace a line . Pushing outward brought no results . It was when my hands slipped across the surface of that stubborn barrier that it moved to one side and I was able to force it open a crack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me leverage enough to force it the rest of the way . How large that hall was I could not guess . It appeared to stretch endlessly both right and left . And there was such a sameness to those lines of boxes one could not find any guide . " Maelen ? " I fell back against the very door I had just forced open . As it had happened before , my mind-seek brought such an answer as nearly struck me down . This response was no concentrated beam , but still it was a daunting blast , filling my mind painfully . So I crouched there , my hands raised  | to my ears in an involuntary response as if to shut out thundering shouts . It was a torment , worse than any physical pain . A warning that here I dared not use the only way I had of tracing her whom I sought . I would have to blunder along , depending on the whim of fortune . Shutting out mind-seek , I staggered forward in a wavering way between the boxes in the row @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ study the faces of those sleepers . There was a sameness about those . They might all have come from some uniform mold , as there appeared to be no distinguishing marks to make one case differ from the next . Then I became a little less dazed by that mental bolt which had struck me and noted that there was a change in the patterning of color sparks about the frame of each box . I counted at first , but after I reached fifty , I decided there was no need for that . Beyond the rows where I walked now were more and more and more . It might be that the entire army of some forgotten conqueror was here laid up in stassfreeze . I laughed then , thinking what an excellent way to preserve troops between one war and the next , assuring a goodly supply of manpower with no interregnum living expenses . Such a find as this had never been made before . In fact the treasure discoveries on Thoth had had no conjunction with the remains of bodies , a puzzle for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ furnishings were placed with rulers as grave goods . So  --  was this the cemetery of those who had left their treasures on Thoth ? But why , then , cross space to bury their dead on another world ?  | And if they were dead , why were their bodies in stassfreeze ? It was a condition known to my own kind in the past , used for two purposes . In the very early days of space travel it had been the only way to transport travelers during long voyages which might last for centuries of planet time . Secondly , it was the one hope for the seriously ill , who could rest thus until some future medical discovery could cure them . Nations , peoples , even species did entomb their dead , following beliefs that at the will of their gods , or at some signal , these would rise whole and alive again . Was this so profound a belief here that they had used stass-freeze to preserve their dead ? I could accept such preservation , but I could not accept the fact that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powers . My mind shied away from the horror that a live mind could be imprisoned in a dead body . There was an end at last to the hall . In the faint light of the boxes I could now see another wall , and in that an archway framing a wide door . A closed door . But I was so filled with a loathing of that place that I halted , fumbled for another charge for the blaster , determined to burn my way out if I found that portal barred to my exit . However , at my urging it rolled aside into the wall . I looked into a passageway . It was lighted , though by what means I could not see , save that the walls themselves appeared to give off a gray luminosity . With the blaster ready I went along . There were doors in this corridor , each tightly closed , each bearing on its surface a series of symbols which had no meaning for me . And where in all this maze could I  | find Maelen ? Since my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dared not risk another call . There was no help but to look within each of the rooms I passed . The first door opened on a small chamber holding but two sleepers . But there were also chests ranged about its walls . However , I did not wait to explore those . Another room  --  three sleepers  --  more storage containers . Room three  --  two sleepers again  --  more chests . I was at the end of the hall and here the way branched right and left . I chose the right . The hall was still lighted and it ran straight , without any break . How many miles did this burrowing run ? I wondered . It might be that Sekhmet was half honeycombed with these tunnelings . What a find ! And if those chests and boxes I had seen in the smaller rooms contained such treasures as had been found on Thoth  --  then indeed the jacks had uncovered a mine which the Guild would not disdain to work . But why had they jeopardized their operation by sabotaging the Lydis ? They could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had we not been forced down and they overplayed their hand by the attack on us . Was it a matter of being over-greedy ? The corridor I now followed began to narrow ; soon it was passage for one only . There  --  I paused , my head up as I sniffed . Some untrackable system of ventilation had supplied all these ways . But this was something different  --  it was an odor I recognized . Somewhere not too far away cyro leaves had been recently burned . There were other faint scents also  --  food  --  cooked food  --  but the cyro overlaid most of that so strongly I could identify little else . Cyro is mildly intoxicating , but it is also used as a counter  | to both body fatigue and some nervous depressions . As a Free Trader I was and am conditioned against certain drugs . By the very nature of our lives we must keep ourselves alert and with top powers of reaction . Just as we are conditioned against a planetside interest in intoxicants of any type , gambling , women not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can spell danger by a clouding of mind , a slowing of body . So well are we armored against such that the use of any can make us violently ill . Now I felt myself swallowing , fighting the nausea that smell induced in me . But such an odor could mean nothing less than that somewhere ahead were , or had been , others than the sleepers . After such a warning my progress was doubly cautious . The hall ended in a blank wall , but then I saw an opening to my right , framing a brighter glow some distance ahead . And so I came out on a low-walled balcony overhanging another large chamber . This in turn was partly open to the sky . And beyond , in that daylight , I caught a glimpse of a spacer 's fins , as if one side of this cavern opened on a landing field . There was no way down from the balcony . But from this perch I had a good view of all which lay below . And there was plenty to see . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and boxes as had been in the rooms . Many of them had shattered lids as if they had been forced . And not too far away two servo robos were fastening up a shipping crate . Off to the right was a plasta-bubble , the kind of living quarters used by explorers as a base camp . This was sealed . But two men sat on upturned boxes outside it . One was speaking into a wrist recorder . The other held a robo con-  | trol board on his knee as he watched the two busy at the crate . There was no one else in sight . I tried to gauge the ship 's size from what I could see of its fins , and decided it must be at least equal to the Lydis , perhaps larger . But there was no doubting that I witnessed a well-established and full-sized operation , and that it had been going on for some time . The last thing I wanted to do was attract their attention . But Maelen  --  had she wandered in here , to be caught @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I mind-call ? There were no sleepers visible . But that did not mean that the jacks might not be using one as a defense or a warning . I was still hesitating when a man came in from outside . Griss Sharvan ! Criss  --  I still could not accept that he was a part of this , or that he had of his own free will gone over to the enemy . I had known him far too long , and he was a Free Trader . Yet he moved freely , gave no sign of being a prisoner . He joined the two by the bubble . The one recording got to his feet hurriedly , as did his companion . They gave the response of underlings in the presence of a leader . What ? what had happened to Griss ? Suddenly his attention turned from them . His head came up , he stared straight up  --  at me ! I fell behind the low wall edging the balcony . His actions had been those of a man alerted to danger , one who knows just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the passage which had brought me here . Only I never reached it . For what struck me then was something I had never experienced before , in spite of my many encounters with different kinds of esper power .  | The command of my own body was taken from me . It was as if my mind was imprisoned in a robo which was obeying commands broadcast by a board . I got to my feet , turned around , and marched back into the sight of the three below , all of whom now watched me . Griss raised his hand , pointed a forefinger at me . To my complete amazement I was raised from the stone under my boots , lifted above the wall , carried out and down , all as if I had antigrav on me . Nor could I struggle against that compelling force which held me captive . That energy deposited me , still on my feet , on the floor of the cavern . I stood there , a prisoner , as the two who had been checking cargo advanced on me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aimed at my head , as if his flesh and bone had become a tangier . The man who still held the robo control reached out his other hand and snatched the blaster from my hold . Even then my hands did not change position , but remained as if I still gripped barrel and butt with them . But the other jack brought out a real tangier , spinning its web of restraint around me . When he was done , Griss 's hand dropped and that compulsion was gone , though now I had no chance at freedom . They had left my legs unbound , and the jack with the tangier caught my shoulder and gave me a vicious shove toward Griss.  | Only it was not Griss Sharvan who stood there . Though he  --  it  --  wore Griss 's body as one might wear a thermo suit . The minute those eyes met mine , I knew . Nor did that knowledge come as too great a shock , since my own experiences had taught me such shifts were possible . However , this was no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preservation of life , such as the Thassa practiced . The personality which had taken over Griss was alien to our kind as the Thassa could never be . I had a swift mental picture of a terrifying creature  --  a thing with a reasonably humanoid body but a head evilly reptilian , a mixture which repelled . Only for an instant did I hold that mental image ; then it was gone . But with its disappearance there was also a flash of incredulous surprise , not on my part , but from the alien . As if he  --  it  --  was astounded that I had been able to pick up that image at all , as its true nature was so well concealed it never revealed itself .  | " Greeting , Krip . " Griss 's voice . But I knew well that those slow , toneless words carried another 's thoughts . I did not attempt any mental scanning , being warned by instinct that such would be the most dangerous thing I could do . " How many are with you ? " He held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impression of listening . A moment later he smiled . " So you are alone , Krip ? Now that was very foolish of you . Not that the whole crew could take us . But if they had been so obliging as to come it would have saved us much trouble . However , one more is a good beginning . " His eyes searched mine , but I had been warned enough to draw on the full resources of my talent , erect a mind-shield . Against that I could feel his probing , but surprisingly , he did not try to force it . I feared , guessed , that had he wanted to , he could easily have stripped me of any defenses , taken over my mind to learn all I had been trying to hide from him . This was a master esper , such as perhaps were the Old Ones among the Thassa , far beyond my own talent . " A beginning , " he repeated . Then he raised his hand in an arrogant gesture , crooking his finger to beckon me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope of disobeying that order . As before , I walked helplessly after him across the cavelike chamber . Never once did he turn his head to see whether or no I was behind , but wove a path in and out among the boxes . So we came to another door and into a passage beyond . The light faded once again to that gray gloom which I had seen above , and the passage made several turns . Along its walls were open doors , but all the rooms were empty .  | That this creature wearing Griss 's body meant me no good was evident . I believed that my only defense against dire and instant peril was to dampen all esper talent , to depend only on the five senses of my body . But those I used as best I could to give me some idea of the territory through which we passed . There were traces of odors from the cyro , but they were soon gone , leaving only an indefinable scent I could not name . Sight gave me the passage and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faint rasp of two pairs of space boots against the stone floor , the fainter pulsing of my own breathing  --  nothing else . And where was Maelen ? A prisoner perhaps in the bubble ? As quickly as I thought of her I thrust that thought again from my conscious mind . If she had not been discovered , I must not betray her . My captor turned his head to glance back at me . And I shivered . He was laughing silently , his whole body quivering in a horrible travesty of the honest mirth my species knew . And his face was a mask of unholy and frightening joy  --  worse than any rictus born of torture or wrath . Yet he made no effort to speak , either orally or by mindtouch . And I did not know whether that made his unseemly laughter , that silent gloating laughter , better or worse ? probably the latter . Still laughing , he turned from the hallway into one of those rooms , and , still helplessly in thrall , I followed . The gray light of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . My captor stepped briskly to the left-hand wall . Once more he put out his hand , pointing a finger even as he had used it to make me prisoner . If he did not touch the  | surface of the stone , he came very close to it . So he began to trace a series of complicated lines . But as his finger moved there glowed on the wall a glistening thread , weaving in and out . I knew that it was a symbol . We have devices such as persona locks which can be opened only by the body heat and thumb pattern of the one setting them . It could be that what I now saw was a very sophisticated development of such a safeguard , coming to life when will alone was focused on it . He drew a design of sharp angles , of lines which to my eyes not only were distorted , but bothered me to look upon , as if they followed rules so alien that the human eye found them disturbing . Yet I could not look away . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line-cross-line , line-upon-line . Now his pointing finger indicated the very heart of the drawing . So he might have opened a well-concealed lock . Sound answered , a grating  --  a protest , as if too long a time had passed since certain mechanisms had been activated . The wall split , a straight-edged crack down through the center of the design . One portion moved to each side to form a narrow doorway . Without hesitation he stepped within , and again I was drawn on . There was no light here , and what sifted in from the chamber behind was sharply cut off as that crack closed . Where we stood now , in another chamber or a corridor , I had no idea . But that pressure kept me walking ahead . By the faint sounds , I deduced that he whom I trailed went as confidently as if he traveled a lighted and well-known road . I fought an imagination which was only too ready to  | picture for me all which might lie underfoot , on either side , even overhead . There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my energy , hold my control , for a time when I might have some small chance against that which walked in Griss Sharvan 's body . To travel in utter darkness , and by another 's will , distorts time . Minutes might have been stretching , or else they were less  --  I had no way of telling . It seemed to me that we went so for a long time , yet it may not have been that at all . Then  --  light ! I closed my eyes against what seemed to be a wild burst of eye-hurting color . Blinked , closed , opened The chamber in which we stood was four-sided with walls which sloped inward , to meet at an apex well over our heads . And those walls were also transparent , so we might have been inside a pyramid-shaped room of crystal . Through the transparent walls we looked into four rooms . And each had its occupant , an unmoving , unbreathing occupant , who yet seemed no statue but a living creature , or once-living creature , frozen into complete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these preserved beings beyond the walls were humanoid to at least the ninth degree outwardly , I had , as I looked upon them , the same sensation of an indweller wholly alien . For three I had that sensation . For the fourth  --  I gazed the longest at him  --  and knew , shocked into applying mind-probe to learn the truth . Griss  --  that was Griss ! As tightly bound within that body as I now was in the tangler 's cords . He was only dimly conscious of what had happened to him , but enough so that  | he was living in an endless nightmare . And how long his reason could so endure I wrenched my eyes away , fearing to draw the crushing burden of his fear just when I needed a clear mind . Such would be no aid to him . Instead I made myself examine more closely the other three who waited there . The rooms themselves were elaborately furnished , the furniture carven , inlaid with gems . Two had narrow beds , the supporting posts of which were the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which bore a small likeness to the Throne of Qur . Tables with small boxes ; chests . Then  --  the inhabitants . Whereas the bodies I had seen in the freeze boxes had been bare , these all wore helmets or crowns . They also possessed eyelashes and eyebrows . Each crown differed also , representing grotesque creatures . I shot another quick glance at that body now holding Griss 's identity . The crown it wore was a brown-yellow in the form of a wide-jawed saurian thing which was akin to the head I had seen in the mental image I had picked up earlier . It sat in a chair , but the one behind the next wall reclined on the narrow bed , head and shoulders supported by a rest of decorated material . The third was seated again . The crown of the second was a bird , and that of the third a sharpmuzzled , prick-eared animal . But the fourth of that company was a woman ! None of those behind the walls were clothed except for their crowns . And their bodies were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my species . The woman was such perfection as I had never dreamed could exist in the flesh . From beneath  | her diadem flowed hair to clothe her almost to her knees . That hair was of a red so deep and dark as to seem nearly black . Her crown was not as massive as those which seemed to weigh down her companions , but rather a band from which sprang a series of upstanding but uneven and unmatched filaments . Then I saw more clearly that each of these bore on its tip a small head like that mask of the cliff face . And each of those heads was equipped with gem eyes . I gasped . When I had looked directly at the woman those cats ' heads of her crown had begun to move , to turn , to rise , until they were all stiffly upstanding , pointing outward as if their jewel eyes were looking back at me in alert measurement . But her own eyes stared beyond me as if I were so far outside her inner world that I had no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me around  --  to face the seated alien with the animal crown . And in my ears , Griss 's voice : " Attend , you ! A great honor for this puny body of yours . It shall be worn by ? " If he had meant to utter some name , he did not . And I think he cut short his words because of caution . There is a belief , found mainly among primitive peoples , that to tell another one 's true name puts one at his mercy . But that such a superstition would persist among aliens with manifestly so high a level of advancement I could not altogether believe . However , that he intended now to force such an exchange as there had been for Griss , I had no doubts at all .  | And I was as afraid as I never remembered being before in my entire life . He caught my head from behind , held it in a vise grip , so that I had to look eye to eye with that one behind the wall . There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could fight , I would ! And I drew upon all the reserves of esper I had , all my sense of being who and what I was . I was only just quick enough to meet the attack . It was not the harsh blanketing which had served as the knockout blow I had met in the ship valley , but rather a pointed thrust , delivered with arrogant self-confidence . And I was able to brace against it without bringing all my own power to bear . Though I did not then catch any surprise , there was a sudden cut-off of pressure . As if he of the animal crown retreated , puzzled by resistance where he had thought to find none at all , retreated to consider what he might actually be facing . While I , given that very short respite , braced myself to await what I was sure would be a much stronger and tougher attack . It came . I was no longer aware of anything outside , only of inner tumult , where some small core of my personality was beaten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breach my last defense and take that inner me captive . But ? I held , and knew the crowned one 's astonishment at such holding . Shock after shock against my will , still I was not engulfed , lost , borne away . Then I felt that other 's growing rage , uncertainty . And I was sure that those waves of pressure were not so strong , that they were ebbing faster and farther as a tide might withdraw from a shore cliff  | which was mercilessly beaten by the sea but which still stood . Awareness of the room returned . My head , still in that hold , was up , eye to eye with him beyond the wall . His face was as expressionless as it had ever been . Yet those features seemed contorted , hideous with a rage born of frustration . " He will not do ! " It was almost a scream within my head , bringing pain with the raw emotion with which it struck . " Take him hence ! he is a danger ! " My captor jerked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the expression was not his , an ugly , raw menace the real Griss had never shown . I thought that he might well burn me down . Yet it seemed he might have some other use for me , for he did not reach for the blaster at his belt but rather sent me sprawling forward , so that I skidded up against the crystal surface of the wall behind which lay the woman , if woman she had ever been . The cat-headed filaments of her crown quivered , dipped , their eyes glinting avidly as they watched me . I slid to my knees as if I were offering some homage to an unresponsive queen . But she stared unseeingly above my head . The alien pulled me up , sent me on , with another push , toward the narrow slit of a doorway near one corner of the room . Then I was for the second time in the full darkness of that passage , this time ahead of my captor . Nor was I to make the full return journey ; for we were not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one could almost feel it , before I was again propelled to the right . I did not strike against any wall there , but kept on , brushing one of my shoulders against a smooth surface . " I do not know what you are , Krip Vorlund , " Griss 's  | voice rang out of the dark . " Thassa , ' says that poor fool whose seeming I wear . It would appear that you are a different breed , with some armor against our will . But this is no time for the solving of riddles . If you survive you may give us an entertaining puzzle at a later hour . If you survive ! " Painfully alert to whatever guides I could use in this dark , I thought his voice sounded fainter , as if he no longer stood close by . Then there was only the dark and the silence , which in its way was as overpowering as the blackness blinding me . No compulsion to follow ; I was as free as if a cord had been cut . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the constriction of tangle cords . I listened , trying even to breathe as lightly as I could so that would not hide any possible sound . Nothing  --  nothing but the horrible weight of the smothering dark . Slowly I took one step and then another from the wall , which was my only point of reference . Two more  --  three steps  --  and I came up against another wall . If I had only had the use of my hands , it would have been a small relief , but that was denied me . Exploration , so hindered , told me at last that the narrow space in which I stood must be the end of another corridor . I found I could not return the way we had come  --  if my sense of direction had not altogether failed me  --  for that had been cut off , though I had not heard the closing of any door . There were left only the three walls , with the fourth side open . Leading perhaps to a multitude of possible disasters . But these I must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creeping , my right shoulder brushing ever against the wall , since I had to have some reference . I found no door , no other opening , always  | the same smooth surface against which my thermo jacket brushed with a soft rustling . And it went on and on I was tired  --  more , I was hungry , and thirst made my mouth and throat as dry as the ashy sand of the valley . To know that I carried at my own belt the means of alleviating all my miseries made it doubly hard . There was no fighting the grip of the tangle bond . To do so would lead to greater and more dangerous constriction . Twice I slipped to the floor of the passage . It was so narrow I had to hunch up with bent knees to rest , for the toes of my boots grated against the other wall . But then to get up again required such effort that the last time I did so , I thought I must keep on my feet and going , with a thin hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could well be I would never have the strength to rise . On and on  --  this was like one of those nightmares in which one is forced to wade through some muck which hinders each step , and yet behind comes a hunter relentlessly in chase . I knew my hunter  --  my own weakness . Action held much of a dreamlike quality for me now . The four crowned ones  --  Griss Sharvan who was not Griss . Maelen Maelen ! She had receded from my mind during that ordeal in the crystal room . Maelen ! When I tried to see my mind-picture of her she flowed into someone else . Maelenher long red hair , her ? Red hair ! No , Maelen had the silver hair of the Thassa , like that now close-cropped on my own skull . RED HAIR  --  the woman of the cat crown ! I flinched . Could it be that some of that compulsion which had been loosed against me back there was still working on me ? Maelen . Laboriously I built my mental picture of her in  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would ever again have any reply from her , I sent out a mind-call . " Krip ! Oh , Krip ! " Sharp , clear , as if shouted aloud in joy because , after long searching , we had come face to face . I could not believe it even though I heard . " Maelen ? " If thought-send could whisper , then mine did . " Krip , where are you ? Come  --  oh , come ? " Clear ; I had not been mistaken , misled . She was here , and close , or that call would not be so loud . I pulled myself together , made answer quickly as I could : " I do not know where I am , except in a very dark and narrow passage . " " Wait  --  say my name , Krip . Give me a direction ! " I obeyed , making of her name a kind of mind-chant , knowing that here perhaps there was power in a name . For upon such a point of identity could a mind-send firmly anchor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  straight ahead , Krip . " I needed no more urging ; my shuffle quickened . Though I still had to go with my shoulder along the wall , since I could not bear to lose that guide in the dark . It was good that I kept it so , for there was another sudden transition from the dark to light , enough to blind me temporarily , so I leaned against the wall with my eyes closed . " Krip ! " So loud she could be there before me ! I opened my eyes . She was . Her black fur was grayed , matted with dust . She wavered from side to side as if she could hardly keep her feet . There was a blotch of dried blood along one side of her head . But she was alive .  | I slipped down by the wall , edging out on my knees to bring me closer to her . But she had dropped to the floor as if no reserve of strength remained in her . Forgetting , I fought my bonds , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " She lay , her head on her paws , flattened to the stone , much as she had lain on her bunk in the Lydis . But now her eyes were fast closed . It was as if the effort of guiding me to her had drained her last strength . Food , water  --  by the look of her , her need for those was greater than my own . Yet I could not help her , not unless she first freed me . And I did not know if she could . " Maelen , at my belt  --  the cutter ? " One of those tools which were the ever-present equipment of an adventurer on an unknown world . Her eyes opened , looked to me . Slowly she raised her head , as if to do so was painful , or so fatiguing she could hardly manage it . She could not regain her feet , and she whimpered as she wriggled on her belly to my side . Bracing herself against my body , she brought her head higher ; her dust-caked muzzle rubbed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had once been so graceful of body , she was now clumsy and awkward , taking a long time to free the cutter from its loop , though I turned and twisted to give her all the aid I could . The tool lay in the dust for a long time ( or so it seemed to me ) before she bent her head to mouth its butt , bring it up to rest against the lowest loop of the tangle bond . Twice the cutter slid away to thud to the stone before she could bite down on the spring releasing its energy . My frustration  | at having to watch her efforts and not be able to help made me ill . But she kept to it stubbornly and finally she made it . The energy blade snipped into the thick round of the tangle well enough so that my own struggles parted it . Once broken , after the way of such , it shriveled away and I was free , though my arms were numb and I found it difficult to lift them . A return @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rations in my supply bag . And I had those at hand as I pulled Maelen 's body closer , supported her head against me , trickling water into her parched , dustrimmed mouth . She swallowed once , again . I put aside the water container , licking my own lips , to unscrew an E-ration tube , squirt the semiliquid contents into her mouth . So I fed her half of that restorative nutriment before I slaked my own thirst , fed my hunger-racked body . For the first time , sitting there , holding the tube to my mouth , Maelen resting against my knee , I really looked about me . This was another of those pyramid-shaped chambers , though it did not rise to a point but was sliced off midway up with a square ceiling much smaller than the floor area . Nor were these walls crystal , but rock . The ledge where we sat was about halfway between roof and floor . I turned my head to see the doorway through which I had come . But there was nothing  --  nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to light , as if I had pushed through a curtain . There was a very steep stair midway along the ledge , descending to the floor . And that floor supported a series of  | blocks , some tall , others shorter , in uneven heights . Cresting each of these was a ball of some opaque substance which was not stone . And in the inner heart of each ball was a faint glimmer of light . The balls were colored  --  red , blue , green , yellow , then violet , orange , paler shades , those closest to the walls the palest hues of all , deepening as one approached the core . The center one there was very dark indeed , almost black . On the surfaces of the brighter and lighter-colored ones were etched patterns . And as I studied them I recognized some  --  there was a reptilian head resembling the crown of the body that now imprisoned Criss ; I saw the animal one , the bird one , and , farthest away , a cat mask . But the meaning of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I leaned back against the wall ; Maelen lay unmoving . I thought that she slept now and I had no desire to trouble her rest . Rest  --  I needed that also . I shut my eyes to the dull light . Undoubtedly I should keep watch , for we must be in the very heart of enemy territory . But this time I could not fight the demands of my body . My eyelids closed against my will ? I fell asleep .  | Now Maelen stood before me , not in animal shape , but as I had known her first on Yiktor . In her hand was that white wand which had been her weapon in those days , and which the Old Ones had taken from her . She was looking not at me , but rather at an inclining stone wall , and I knew that we were still in the burrows beneath the crust of Sekhmet . And she was using that wand as those with certain esper talents might to search out the presence of water , or any object worked by men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down but stretched in a straight line before her . Holding it so , almost as if it were imbued with energy of its own to draw her after it , she walked forward . Afraid to lose her once again , even in this dream , I followed . The wand touched the wall , and that barrier was gone . Now we passed into a space which had no boundaries , in which there was no substance . Until once more we stood in a chamber . Looking around , I knew where we were ,  | though this time I was on the opposite side of the crystal wall . There was that narrow bed , upheld by four cat creatures , on which lay the woman . And the gem-eyed heads of her diadem arose straight on their fine filaments . They did not all face Maelen ; rather they twisted and made quick darts here and there until brought up short by the threads which attached them to the circlet about that red hair . It was as if they were alarmed . Maelen paid no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crown . Rather she advanced to the end of the couch , her wand pointed at the other 's body , her own gaze intent , measuring She glanced once to me , showing that she knew I had followed . " Remember this one in time of need ? " Her thought was faint , as if we were far separated , yet I could have put out my hand and laid it on her arm . Although I knew that I must not . " Why ? " Her words were too ambiguous . That they were of import I did not doubt , but for me they had no meaning . She did not answer , only gave me a long , level look . Then she turned once more to the woman with her now wildly writhing crown , as if she must imprint that image so firmly in her mind that a hundred years hence she would still see it in detail . The wand trembled , wavered from side to side . I could see that with both her hands Maelen fought to hold it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her grasp . I opened my eyes . My neck and shoulders were stiff where they rested against the stone of the wall . I felt an  | inner chill which my thermo clothing was no proof against . My hands moved over fur engrimed with dust and grit . I looked down . The glassia head rose from its pillow on my arm . " Maelen ? " So vivid had that dream been that I half expected to find her still as she had been moments ago . " Look yonder ! " She used her nose as a pointer to indicate the globes . Some of those were glowing brighter , giving more light to the chamber . It took me only a moment or two to be sure that not all of them had so awakened  --  just those with the reptilian design . " Criss ! " I put the only name I knew to that menace . " Griss Sharvan ? " Her thought was surprised . " What has this to do with him ? " " Much , perhaps . " Swiftly I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been taken captive by that thing wearing Griss 's body , and of the visit to the crystal-walled chamber where he had endeavored to give my body to his fellow being . " She is also there , is she not ? " Maelen asked . I did not mistake her . There was only one " she " ? the woman of the cat crown . " Yes ! And , Maelen , just now I dreamed ? " " I know what manner of dream that was , since it also spun me into its web , " she interrupted again . " I had thought that no one could surpass the Thassa in inner powers . But it would seem that in some things we are as children playing with bright pebbles , making patterns on the earth ! I think that these have slept here to preserve their race against some great peril in the past . But only those  | four you have seen survived , able to rise to full life again . " " But if they can be revived , why do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the means of revival on their own can not now be used . Or it may be that they wish to pass among us as beings of our own kind . " " To take over . " That I could believe . Had the seeming Griss Sharvan concealed his alienness , posed perhaps as a captive among the jacks , we would have been deceived and so in saving him could have brought disaster among ourselves . I thought of the men I had left behind on the cliff . They were facing worse than jack blasters  --  and now I was impatient to be away , to warn them . I had found Maelen . Now we must find our way out , return to the Lydis , or to the force of our men . What was happening here was vastly larger and worse than any jack looting ! " You are right . " Maelen had followed my thoughts . " But as to discovering the path out  --  that I do not know . Can you even now find the door which you entered ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see any opening , I was sure I knew just where I had come through to this ledge . Gently I lifted her aside and arose . To make certain I would not miss what I sought if the opening were disguised in some manner , I put my fingers to the surface of the wall and edged along back toward that place where I thought I had entered . I reached the far end of the ledge . There was no opening . Sure that I had made some mistake , yet somehow equally certain I could not have , I made a slow passage back , this time reaching both above and below my former tracing of  | of the surface . I returned to Maelen . There had been no break in that solid wall . " But I did come through ! " I burst out , and my protest echoed hollowly through that space . " True . But where ? " Her question seemed a mockery of my vehemence . Then she continued . " Such an experience is not unknown here . This has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been so completely lost . " " Tell me ! " I demanded now . So I learned how she had made her way from the ship valley , found the sleeper with the amplifier , how she had come to witness the looting of the cache , even as I guessed it might all have happened . But for the rest it was a tale of a strange journey , of her will battling that of another reaching out for her . Not , she felt , for her personally , but as one might fling a net in hope of catching something within it . But that compulsion was not continuous in its powers and she was able to fight it at intervals . It had brought her to where the ship of the jacks was finned down , and through the cavern there into the passages beyond . But there , bemused by the ebb and flow of the current which held her , she had been lost . Then she had contacted me , had been drawn toward my call in turn . " I had believed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admitted frankly . " Always I have been warned that I was too proud of my powers . If that was ever so , it is no longer . For here I have been as one played with by something infinitely greater , allowed to run a little , then put under restraint again . Yet this is the strangest of all , Krip ? I will swear by the Word of Molaster that this power , this  | energy , whatever it may be , was not as conscious of me as I am of it . It was rather as if it flexed muscles in exercise so that it might be ready to use all its strength at a future call . " " The four of that inner place ? " I suggested . " Perhaps . Or they may be only extensions of something else , infinitely greater still . They are adepts , without question  --  very powerful ones . But even an adept recognizes something above and beyond himself . We name Molaster in our petitions . But that is only our name for what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our belief . These others are ? " What she might have added to her speculations was left unsaid . Those yellow globes with the reptilian masks , which had been glowing so much brighter , now gave off a low , humming note . And that sound , subdued as it was , startled us into immobility . We crouched , breathing only shallowly , our heads going right to left , left to right , as we went on guard against what this change might herald . " Where is the door out ? " I demanded . " Perhaps you can guess better than I have been able to . Even as you , I went from dark to light , found this ledge , but no return . When your mind-send came I hoped it would direct me to an exit . But that was not to be . You came to me instead . " " Where did you come in ? " Her nose pointed to the other end of the ledge , well away from the spot where I was still sure my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fingers along the surface , hunting the smallest hint of an opening . I still had the cutter which Maelen had used on the tangler cords . Perhaps with that , or one of the other tools from my belt , I could  | force a lock , were I able to find it . A forlorn hope , but one clings to such . The humming from the globes was continuous now . And it did something to my hearing . Or was there a more subtle outflow rising beyond the range of audibility to affect my thinking ? Twice I found I had halted my search , was standing , gazing down at the globes , my mind seemingly blanked out . It could only have lasted a second or two , but it was frightening . Now I believed that the globes were generating a haze . The forbidding representation of the designs on them was fading . However , that concealment acted in a strange way , just the opposite of what one might expect . One could no longer see those monsters , their elongated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet there was the feeling that so hidden , they were more alive ! " Krip ! " Maelen 's thought-cry dispelled what was building in my mind . I was able to look away , turn my head back to the wall . But now I feared that a danger worse than imagination presented was threatening us . Solid wall . I thumped it now with my fist as I went , my blows faster , more savage . All they brought me was bruises and pain . Until  --  I had carried in mind so sharply the thought of a door , the need for a door  --  my fist went through ! To my eyes the stone was solid , as solid as it had ever been . But my hand had sunk in up to the wrist . " Maelen ! " She needed no call . She was already padding toward me . Door  --  where had the invisible door come from ? " Think door  --  think it ! See a door in your mind ! "  | I obeyed her . Door  --  there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My hand had gone through the opening . There might be an illusion to deceive the eye , but there was nothing now to baffle touch . I rested my other hand on Maelen 's head and we moved resolutely forward together into what appeared solid , unbroken stone . Again we passed abruptly from light to dark . But also , as if a portal had slammed shut behind us , the humming was instantly silenced . I gave a sigh of relief . " Is this your way ? " I asked . Though how she could be certain of that in the dark , I did not know . " I can not be sure . But it is a way . We must keep together . " I left my hand on her head as she crowded against me . So linked , we went on , very slowly and cautiously , my other hand outstretched before me to warn of anything which might rise in our path . Shortly thereafter I found a wall , traced along it until there was another way open to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ direction , and Maclen confessed to a similar disability . We could do little until we found some lighted way . That we might not do so was a horror we refused to give mind-room to . Whether the Thassa shared the ancient fear of the dark with my own race , I did not know . But the sense of compression , of stiffling pressure , returned . Save that this time I did not walk with my arms bound to my sides . " Left now ? " " Why ? How do you know ? " " Life force in that direction . " I tried mind-probe for myself . She was right  --  a flicker  | of energy . It was not the high flow I associated with the aliens , but more like such as I could pick up when not too far from a crew member . And there was an opening to the left . How far we were from the chamber of the globes now I could not guess . But a lighting of the way cheered us  --  and that grew ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mutter of voices , but rather the clank of metal . Maelen pushed against me . " He , the one who wears Griss 's body  --  ahead ! " I tried no probe . I wished I could do just the opposite , reduce all mental activity so far down the scale he could not pick up any hint of us in return . I had not forgotten how easily he had found me out when I had spied on the jacks . " He is one-minded now , " Maelen told me , " using all his power for something which is of very great importance to him . We need not fear him , for he puts all to one purpose . " " And that ? " She did not reply at once . Then " Lend me of your sending ? " It was my turn to hesitate . To strengthen any mind-seek she might send out could make us more accessible to discovery . Yet I trusted her enough to realize that she would not suggest such a move unless she thought we had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sped out , and I fed my own energy to it . This we had not often done , so it was a relatively new experience for me , bringing with it an odd sensation of being pulled along in a current I could not fight . Then a blurred mind picture came .  | We seemed to be hanging in the air over a pit , or rather we were in the apex of one of those pyramid chambers . Below a robo was blasting away at the foot of one wall . There was already a dark cavity there ; now the machine was enlarging that . Behind the worker stood Griss . He did not hold any control board . It would appear that he was able to keep the robo at work without that . And his attention was completely absorbed by what he was doing . But that feverish desire which drove him was like a broadcast . He did not hold his defenses now , but fastened avidly on what he sought ? an ancient storehouse of his kind , perhaps containing machines or weapons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A whiff , I say , because I caught only the edge of it . Around the chamber , well above the level at which the robo worked , was another of the ledge ways . This ran across one wall , leading from one door to another . And without needing to to be told , I recognized that this was the path we must follow . Whether we could do it without attracting attention from below was another matter . But now that hole the robo battered was larger . The machine wheeled back , became inert . And the alien hurried to the break , disappeared through it . " Now ! " We sped along the lighted corridor , and it was only a short distance until we ventured out on that ledge . It was so close to the apex of the pyramid that the opposite wall leaned very close . Maelen found it easier to take that route than I , for I could not stand erect but had to go on hands and knees .  | Nor did I waste any time looking back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door on the other side , scramble within , was all I wanted . " We made it ! " " For now , yes , " she answered me . " But ? " She swung around , her head down . Her dusty body quivered . " Krip ! Krip , hold me ! " It was a cry for help , coming so suddenly , without warning , that I was startled . Then I half threw myself over her , grasping her tightly around the body , holding on in spite of her struggles for freedom . It was no longer Maelen whom I held so , but an animal that growled and snapped , struck out with unsheathed claws . Only by pure chance did I escape harm . Then she collapsed against me , her breath coming in deep gasps . There were flecks of white foam at the corners of her jaws . " Maelen , what is it ? " " The calling  --  it was stronger this time , much stronger . Like  --  like to like ! " " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was far from fighting now . As if her struggle had exhausted her , she was in nearly the same condition in which I had earlier found her . " The dream  --  she of the cat crown . " Maelen 's thoughts did not make a completely coherent pattern . " She is  --  akin to Thassa ? " But I refused to believe that . I could see no resemblance between her and the Maelen I had known . " Maybe not to the sight , " Maelen agreed . " Krip  --  is there more water ? " She was still panting , the sound of it close to human sobbing . I found the flask , poured a little  | in her mouth . But some I must save , for we did not know when we could replenish that small supply . She swallowed greedily , but she did not press me for more . " The mind-call  --  the dream  --  I knew their like . Such are of Thassa kind . " I had a flash of inspiration . " Could it be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pattern be altered to a familiar one , thus with a better chance of entrapping you ? " " That may well be so , " she admitted . " But between me and that other there is something ? Only when I face her , it will be on my terms and not hers , if you will give me of your strength as you did this time when she called . " " You are sure it was she ? Not the one we just saw ? " " Yes . But when I go it will be at a time of my choosing . Which is not yet . " Having taken a mouthful of water myself , I brought out an E-ration tube , which we shared half and half . Made for nourishment during times of strain , it was high in sustenance and would keep us going for hours to come . There was no sound from the chamber where the robo must still be on guard beside that hole . I wondered very much what the alien sought beyond the battered wall . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On the contrary , she asked a question so much apart from the matters at hand I was startled . " Do you think her fair ? " Her ? Oh , I realized , she must mean the alien woman . " She is very beautiful , " I answered frankly .  | " A body without blemish  --  though strange in its coloring . A perfect body ? " " But its mind reaches for another covering . That which walks in Griss was also perfect outwardly , yet its rightful owner saw fit to exchange with Griss . And I was taken there to exchange with another one . Are they in stass-freeze , I wonder ? " " Yes . " She was definite . " That other one , he whom they used on the cliff top ? " " Lukas said he was dead  --  long dead . But those four , I am sure they are alive . The one in Griss must be ! " " Perhaps it may be that their bodies , once released from stass-freeze , will truly die . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they wish to preserve those for some other reason . And they seek our bodies as we would put on meaner clothes which may be soiled and thrown away once some dirty job is finished . But  --  she is very beautiful ! " There was a wistfulness in that , one of those infrequent displays of what appeared to be human emotion on Maelen 's part . And such always moved me the more because they came so seldom . So I believed her a little subject to the same desires as my own species . " Goddess , queen  --  what was she , or who ? " I wondered . " We can not guess her real name . " " Yes , her name . " Maelen repeated my thought in part . " That she would not want us to know . " " Why ? Because " ? and I thought then of the old superstition ? " that would give us power over her ? But that is the belief of a primitive people ! And I would say she is far from primitive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ? Maelen was impatient ? " belief is important . Belief can move the immovable if it is rightly applied . Should a people believe that one 's name is so personal a possession that to know it gives another power over one , then for them that is true . And from world to world degrees of civilization differ as much as customs and names for gods . " My head was up now , and I sniffed , alerted once again by a scent rather than a sound . Maelen must have been quick to catch the same trace of odor . " Ahead  --  others . Perhaps their camp . " Where there was a camp free of these burrows , to return to the Lydis . At least my sojourn here had given me knowledge enough to warn and arouse my fellows to such danger as we had not known existed . So  --  if we did want to escape the heart of the enemy 's territory , we must still push on into what might be open danger . But I had not realized that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For when we came to a doorway we were looking out into the cavern of the jack camp . The looted chests were piled about , and we could see , in the outer air before the entrance , a portion of the ship 's fins . There was a line of robos , all idle now , to the right . No sign of any men about . If we could keep to cover behind the boxes we might reach the outer opening But one step , or at the most two , at a time . Maelen was slinking , with her belly fur brushing the floor , along behind that line of empty chests . And I crouched as low as I could to join her . There was no sound ; we could be totally alone .  | But we dared not depend on such good fortune . And it was well that we did not , for the side of the plasta-bubble tent parted as its entrance was unsealed and a man came out . When I saw him I froze . Harkon  --  and not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned to look back over his shoulder , as if waiting for someone else . Had the party from the Lydis taken , by some miracle of fortune , the headquarters of the jacks ? If so , they must be speedily warned of what wore Griss 's body . I had no illusions as to what would happen if that confronted them . The odds might be ten to one against that alien and yet he would come out the winner .  | ' We are told that all the universe lies on the balance of Molaster 's unseen scales  --  good weighs against bad , ill against well . And when it seems to us most likely that fortune has turned , that is the time to be most wary . I had met much which was new to me since I had put on Vors 's body and come to be one of this band of off-worlders . Yet I had always supposed that the core of the balance remained the same and that only the outer forms differed . However , in these underground ways I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all I had known before that many times I could only make blind choices . And to a Moon Singer of the Thassa a blind choice is an affront and a defeat . Twice I had dreamed true  --  I could not be deceived in that  --  of her whom Krip had actually looked upon . Why was she so familiar to me when I had never seen her like before ? There were no women on the Lydis , and those I  | had met on the three planets we had visited since first I raised from Yiktor were no different from the females of the plains people  --  never more than pale copies of what their men desired , creatures without rights or many thoughts . But she  --  there was in me such a longing , a drive , to go and look upon her in body even as I had in dream , that I ever struggled against that compulsion , nor did I reveal it wholly to Krip . But that he had shared my second dream was to me proof that danger lay in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet . For what he had to tell me of the fate they had intended for him was a warning . I believe that it was perhaps that small bit of Thassa lurking in him which had defeated the takeover they had planned . During the months we had voyaged together I had realized that Krip was a greater esper than he had been at our first meeting . It was my thought that this slow awakening of power , this development of his talent , was influenced by Maquad 's body . Though I did not know how or why . Which again gave me to think about what a long indwelling in my present form might do to me ! I knew that the aliens had not been able to dispossess him , that the . encased creature had ordered him taken away as a possible danger . ' And that small fact was the only favorable thing I had to hold to  --  save that we were together again and had found the door to the outer world . It was pleasing that Krip did not move at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His care to remain in hiding , willing to accept nothing and no one unproved , reassured me . So we lay behind the boxes watching . Nor did either of us use mind-send . For if this Patrolman was not  | what he seemed , we would be thus betrayed to greater peril than we had lately been in . Harkon moved away from the bubble and another came out  --  Juhel Lidj of the Lydis . He , too , carried his weapon ; still , about both of them there was no sign that they feared any enemy . They were too much at their ease . And yet they were both men who had faced danger many times over , not foolhardy adventurers . Together they passed us , moving toward the back of the cave and the mouth of one of the dark ways there . Still Krip did not stir nor try to hail them , and I waited his lead . But he edged around to watch them go . When he could be sure they were out of sight his hand touched my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " They  --  I have a feeling all is wrong  --  not right . " " So do I , " I was quick to answer . " Could they have been taken over also ? It is best we try to reach the Lydis . But if I have guessed wrong , and they are walking straight into what lies there ? " I felt him shiver , his fingers on my head tremble slightly . " If they are as you fear now , then they are masters here , and should they discover us ? But if the others are still free from such contamination they must be warned . For the present we can hope such domination is confined to Sekhmet . Have you thought what might happen if their ship out there lifts off , carrying those who can change bodies as easily as you change the clothing on your back  --  spreading the contagion of their presence to other worlds ? " " Such evil as has never been known before . And there could be no finding them once they were off this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still you may . " In  | this I was urging what I had decided was the greater good . There was nothing one man and one glassia could do in these burrows to overset such enemies , but there was much which we could accomplish elsewhere . " They could already have started it , " he said then . " How do we know how many there are of them  --  how many voyages that ship out there has made ? " " The more reason why a warning must be given . " ' We were on the move again , using the looted chests as a shield as long as we could . Then we came into the pallid daylight at the cavern 's entrance . The cargo hatches of the ship were sealed , but her passenger ramp was still out . Krip looked up at her . He was far more knowledgeable of such than I. To me she merely seemed larger than the Lydis , and so I said . " She is . We are D class ; this is a C class @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She is slow , but can lift far more than the Lydis . And she has no insignia , which means she is a jack ship . " There were no guards to be seen , but we still kept to cover . And the broken nature of the country seemed designed to aid such skulking . That and the fact that the clouds were very dense overhead and a cold , ice-toothed rain began to fall . Shivering under the lash of that , we found a place where we could climb the cliff . We thought prudence dictated such an exit rather than use of the rough road beaten by many robo tracks . Aloft , I could trust for our guide to the sense which was a part of Vors 's natural equipment , and we headed in the direction where I was sure we would find the Lydis . But it was a nightmare of a journey , with the sleet sluicing around  | us and the dark growing thicker . We crawled where we longed to run , afraid of missteps which would plunge us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I unsheathed claws to anchor me and crept close to the ground under the beating of its force and that of the sleet . " Krip ? " Here four clawed feet might manage , but I was not sure that two booted ones might do as well . And the fury of this storm was like nothing I had felt before . It was almost as if the natural forces of this forsaken world were ranged on the side of those who looted . " Keep on ! " There was no weakness in his reply . I had come to a down slope where the water poured in streams about me as I twisted and turned , using every possible hint of protection against the worst blasts . As I went I began to doubt very gravely if we could press on to the Lydis , wonder whether it would not be much more prudent to seek shelter and wait out the worst of this storm . And I was about to look for a place where we could do so , when the stones my claws rasped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with them . Over  --  out  --  into nothingness ! An instant of knowing that I was falling  --  then a blast of pain and darkness . Yet that dark was not complete , and I carried with me an instant of raw , terrifying knowledge  --  that it had been no normal misstep , no chance which had brought me down . I had been caught in a trap I had not suspected . And , recognizing that , I knew also why it had been done and the full danger of what might follow . But with Sharvan , again with Krip on Yiktor , there had  | been an exchange of bodies . Why need my present one be destroyed  --  why ? How better to enforce slavery upon an identity than by destroying the body which it inhabited ? Pain ! Such pain as I had not believed could exist in a sane world . And in no way would my body obey me . " Can not  --  can never now ? " The message reaching me was erratic , such as a faulty line of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  come ! " " Where ? For what purpose ? " " Life force  --  life force ! Live again  --  come ! " I made the great effort of my life , trying to cut off the pain of my body , to center all my energy and will on that which was the core of my identity . " Come  --  your body dies  --  come ! " Thereby that which called made its grave error . All living things have a fear of being blotted out , of nonexistence . It is part of our armor , to keep us ever alert against evil , knowing that we have a certain way to walk and that how we walk it judges us on Molaster 's scales . We do not give up easily . But also the White Road has no terrors for the Thassa , if the time has come for us to step onto its way . This which had entrapped me played upon the fear of nonexistence , as if those with whom it had had earlier dealings could visualize no other life beyond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what it wanted by offering life continuation quickly at the moment when that death approached . " Come ! " Urgency in that . " Would you be nothing ? "  | So I read its great need . My identity was not what it wished to take to itself , nor did it seek another 's body . For to it its own covering was a treasure it clung to . No , it wanted my life force as a kind of fuel that , drawing upon this force , it might live again on its own terms . " Maelen ! Maelen , where are you ? " " Come ! " " Maelen ! " Two voices in my head , and the pain rising again ! Molaster ! I gave my own cry for help , trying not to hear either of those other calls . And there came an answer  --  not the White Road , no . That I could have if I willed it . But such a choice would endanger another plan . That was made clear to me as if I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vast scene of action spread before me . What I saw then I could not remember , even as I looked upon it . But that it was needful , I knew . And also I understood that I must struggle to fulfill my part in that purpose . " Come ! " No coaxing , no promises now  --  just an order delivered as if it could not possibly be disobeyed . " Come now ! " But I answered that other call of my name , sent my own plea . " Here  --  hurry ! " How I might carry out the needful task I did not know . Much would depend now upon the skill and resources of another . I could not make the glassia body obey me or even give me sight . To keep my mind clear , I had to block off all five senses lest pain drive me completely forth . But my mind  --  that much I had  --  for a space . " Krip ! " Whether he was still on the cliff top or beside  | me , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him and give him this last message or all would fail . " Kripthis body  --  I think it is too badly broken  --  it is dying . But it must not die yet . If you can get it into stass-freeze ? You must ! That box with the sleeper  --  get me to that ? " I could not even wait for any answer to my message . I must just hold grimly , as long as I could . And how long that might be  --  only Molaster could set limit to . It was a strange hidden place where that which was the real " I " ? Maelen of the Thassa , Moon Singer once , glassia once  --  held and drew upon all inner resources . Did that other still batter at my defenses , crying " Come , come ? live " ? I did not know . I dared not think of anything save holding fast to this small stronghold which was under attack . Weaker grew my hold so that at times the pain struck in great punishing blows . Then I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had not done since they took away my wand . And the words were like dim , glowing coals where once they had been leaping flames of light . Yet still there was a feeble life in them and they sustained me , damping out the pain . There was no time in this place  --  or else far too much of it . I assured myself , " I can hold one more instant , and one more , and one more " ? and so it continued . Whether Krip could accomplish that which would save me , or if it would save me ? But I must think of nothing save the need to hold on , to keep my identity in this hidden place . I must hold and hold and hold ! But I could no longer ? Molaster ! Great were the powers once given me , much did I increase them by training . But there comes an end to all  --  and that faces me now . I have  | lost , I can not remember that pattern of life which I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that not by the will of the Great Design was it interrupted for me . Yet it would seem that I have not the strength to finish out my part of it . I  --  can not  --  hold Pain rushed in as a great scarlet wave to drown me . " Maelen ! " One voice only now . Had that other given up ? But I thought that even yet , were I to yield , it would sweep me into its web . " Maelen ! " " Freeze ? " I could shape only that one last plea . And so futile , so hopeless a one it was . There came no answer . None  --  save that the pain grew less , now almost bearable . And I had not been cut free from the body . What " Maelen ! " I was in the body still . Though I did not command it , yet it served as an anchor . And there was a freedom from that pressure which had been upon me . As if the process of my " death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given a short breathing space . " Maelen ! " Imperative , imploring  --  that call . I summoned up the dregs of my energy . " Krip  --  freeze ? " " Yes , Maelen . You are in the case  --  the case of the alien . Maelen  --  what ? " So  --  he had done it . He had taken that last small chance and it was the right one . But I had no time for rejoicing , not now . I must let him know the final answer . " Keep freeze  --  Old Ones  --  Yiktor ? "  | My hold on consciousness , if one could term that state of rigid defense " consciousness , " broke . Did I walk the White Road now ? Or was there still a place for me in the great pattern ?  | The wind could not reach ally here , still my hands were numb . I watched the box . how I had ever mastered its catches , opened it long enough to pull out the body it had contained and put the broken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I did not know . I shook with shock more than with chill , weak with the effort of transporting what had been Maelen across the rocky way , sure that she  --  that no living thing could survive such handling in the state I found her after that terrible fall . Yet she had lived , she was in freeze now . And I swore she would get to Yiktorto the Old Ones  --  that she was not going to die ! Though how I might do this I did not know . I edged around . There stood the Lydis far below , the two flitters . No sign of life about them . Something else lay here among the rocks . I stared , and my shudders grew worse . The alien I had pulled so hastily from the freeze box But no body lay there  --  only a crumbling mass . I covered  | my eyes . Lukas had said it was dead , and his words were being proved now . Not that it mattered  --  nothing did , save Maelen . And the warning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they still men or ? And who else ? All those who had gone out against an enemy infinitely stronger than we had suspected ? I put out my hand to the freeze box as gently as I might have laid it on a furred head . " I can not take you with me now , " I thought . Perhaps I could still reach her , perhaps not . But I had to try to make her understand that I was not deserting her . " I shall be back  --  and you shall see Yiktor , the Old Ones  --  live again . I swear it ! " Then I set about wedging that box even more tightly among the rocks , making very sure that it could not be shifted by any freak of wind or storm . If she was safe now , that covering must endure until I could fulfill my promise . Having done what I could to ensure her protection , I descended through the lashing of wind and sleet to the floor of the valley . Reaching there , I used my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open the Lydis to me , waiting tensely for some sign that the call had been heard within the ship . My answer came , not from the ship , but out of the night . A flash beam cut the black , pinned me against the rock wall of the cliff . Jacks  --  they had beaten me here ! I was so dazzled by that ray that I could not see who was behind it , though I believed they were moving in for the kill . I had no weapon now . Then someone stepped out into the light beam and I saw the uniform . Patrol ! Only now that could be no reassurance either . Not since I had seen  | Harkon and Lidj in the cavern and knew what walked in Griss 's body . I tried to read in his face whether he was what he seemed or one of the enemy , but there was no clue in either eyes or expression . He motioned with his hand . The howling of the wind was far too loud to allow speech , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flashed downward , pointing a path to the ship , the upper edge of it catching the slow descent of the ramp . I went . The Lydis had been my home for years , and I had felt privileged that that was so . But now , as I climbed her ramp , using handholds to drag myself up against the sweep of the wind , it was as if I approached something alien , with a whiff of trap about it . It could be just that , if the contagion of the aliens had spread this far . I found myself sniffing as I came through the lock , the Patrolman behind me , as if I could actually scent that alien evil I feared to find here . But there was only the usual smell of a star ship . I began to climb the ladder to the control cabin . What would I find there ? " Vorlund ! " Captain Foss . And beyond him a Patrol officer with the stellar sword badge of a commander . Others ? Though it was on Foss I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could I be sure ? What might have happened during that endless time I wandered underground ? I did not answer but only stared at him , searching his face for any hint that he was not the man I knew . Then one of the Patrolmen who had followed me up the ladder took me by the arm , turned me a little as if I were  | totally helpless , and pushed me down into the astrogator 's chair , which swung as my weight settled in it . I dared to try mind-probe  --  for I had to know if there was yet time . " You are Foss ! " My voice sounded thin , hardly above a whisper . Then I saw his expression change , recognized that slight lift of one brow  --  something I had seen many times in the past . " You were expecting someone else ? " he asked . " One of them . " I was near to babbling , suddenly so tired , so drained of energy . " Like Griss  --  one of them  --  inside your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that at all , or only thought it ? Then the captain turned to the emergency dispenser on the wall , twirled its dial , brought out a sustain tube . He came over to me . I tried to raise my hand to take that restorative . My body would not obey . He held it to my mouth and I drank . The stuff was hot , fighting the chill and shaking weariness in me . " One of them  --  inside my body ? " he said as if that were the most natural condition . " Perhaps you had better explain . " " Back there . " I gestured to the wall of the Lydis , hoping I was indicating the direction of the burrows . " Aliens . They can take over our bodies . They did with Griss . He 's ? he 's in the alien body now  --  behind a wall . IIe ? " I shut out that memory of Griss imprisoned in the motionless body wearing the reptilian crown . " I think maybe Lidj , Harkon , too . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as if they had nothing to fear . Maybe others ? They  | tried to do it with me  --  did n't work . The alien was angry , said I was dangerous  --  to put me in the dark ? Then I found Maelen . " Maelen ! In that freeze box  --  on the cliff . Maelen ! " What about Maelen ? " Foss had taken the pilot 's seat so that his eyes were now on a level with mine . He sat forward , and his hands took mine from where they lay limp , holding them in a firm , warm grip . " What happened to Maelen ? " I sensed a stir , as if the Patrol officer moved closer . Foss frowned , not at me . " What about Maelen , Krip ? " " She fell  --  onto the rocks  --  all broken . Dying  --  she was dying ! Told me  --  must freeze  --  freeze until I could get her home , back to Yiktor . I took her  --  all broke , broken ? " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , to forget that nightmare of a journey , but he would not let me . " Took her to the alien  --  opened the box  --  took the alien 's body out  --  put her in . She was still alive  --  then . " " These aliens . " Foss 's voice was level , clear . He held me by it as well as by the grip on my hands and wrists . " Do you know who they are ? " " Lukas said dead  --  a long time . But they are esper . And the crowned ones are not dead . Bodies  --  they want bodies ! Griss , for sure , maybe the others . There are four of them ? I saw  --  counting the woman . " " He does n't make sense ! " cut in an impatient voice . Again Foss frowned in warning . " Where are these bodies ? " " Underground  --  passages  --  rooms . The jacks have a camp ? in a cavern  --  ship outside . They were looting  --  rooms  | with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my head . I had a bitter taste in my mouth as if the restorative was rising now to choke me . " Where ? " " Beyond the cache . I got in through the cat 's mouth . " I tried to control that nausea , to remain coherent . " Passage there . But they  --  Griss  --  can hold men with thought alone . If the rest are like him , you have no chance . Never met an esper like him before , not even Thassa . Maelen thought they could not take me over because I am part Thassa now . But they did take me prisoner  --  Griss did  --  just by willing it . They used a tangier on me after . " " Korde . " Foss gave a swift order . " Scrambler on  --  highest frequency ! " " Yes , sir ! " Scrambler , I thought vaguely  --  scrambler ? Oh , yes , defense against probes . But would it work against the thing in Griss 's body ? " About the others . " The Patrol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the others  --  my men ? yours ? " " I do n't know . Only saw Griss , Harkon , Lidj ? " " And you think that Harkon and Lidj may also be taken over ? " " Saw them walking around in jack camp , not taking any precautions . Had the feeling they had no reason to fear discovery . " " Did you probe them ? " " Did n't dare . Probe , and if they were taken over , they would have taken us , Maelen and me . Griss  --  he knew I was there even before he saw me . He made me walk  | out into their hands . But  --  they acted as if they belonged in that camp . And there was no sign of the others with them . " I saw Foss nod . " Perhaps the right guess . You can sense danger . " " Take you over , " I repeated . The restorative was no longer working . I was slipping away , unable to keep my eyes open . " Maelen ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night or day in the interior of the Lydis , but I had that dazed feeling that one has when one has slept very heavily . I put up one hand to deliver the usual greeting rap on the side of the upper bunk . If Maelen had slept too Maelen ! Her name unlocked memory and I sat up without caution , knocking my head painfully against the lowslung upper bunk . Maelen was still out there  --  in the freeze box ! She must be brought in , put under such safeguards as the ship could give . How had I come to forget about her ? I was already on my feet , reaching for the begrimed thermo clothing dropped in a heap on the floor , when the door panel opened . I looked around to see the captain . Foss was never one to reveal his thoughts on his face . A top Trader learns early to dissemble or to wear a mask . But there are small signs , familiar to those who live in close company , which betray strong emotions . What I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had known only once or twice during the time I had shipped on board the Lydis . Deliberately he entered my cabin without invitation . That act in itself showed the gravity of the situation . For privacy is so curtailed on board a spacer that each member of the crew is overly punctilious about any invasion of another 's . He pulled down one of the wall seats and sat in it , still saying nothing . But I was in no mood to sit and talk , if that was his intention . I wanted Maelen as safe as I could make her . I had no idea how long I had slept , leaving her exposed to danger . Since the captain seemed in no hurry to announce his business with me , I broke silence first . " I must get Maelen . She is in an alien freeze box  --  up on the cliffs . I must get her into our freeze compartment ? " As I spoke I sealed my thermo jacket . But Foss made no move to let me by , unless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Foss repeated her name , but there was something so odd about the tone of his voice that he caught my attention in spite of my impatience to be gone . " Vorlund , how did it come about that you were n't with the rest  --  that you found your own way into that chain of burrows ? You left here in company . " His eyes held mine in intent measuring . Perhaps , had my mind not been largely on the need for reaching Maelen , I might have been uneasy , or taken partial warning from both his question and his attitude . " I left them on the cliff top . Maelen called  --  she was in trouble . "  | " I see . " He was still watching me with a measuring look , as if I were a piece of merchandise he had begun to suspect was not up to standard . " Vorlund ? " Suddenly he reached up and pressed a stud . The small locking cupboard sprang open . As the inner side of the door was a mirror , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always gave me a feeling almost of shock to see my reflection thus . After so many years of facing one image , it takes time to get used to another . My skin was somewhat browner than it had been on Yiktor . Yet it in no way matched the dark space tan which all the other crew members had and which I had once accepted as proper . Against even the slightest coloring my silver brows , slanting up to join the hairline on my temples , and the very white locks there , close-cropped as they were , had no resemblance to my former appearance . I now had the delicately boned Thassa face , the pointed chin . " Thassa . " Foss 's word underlined what I saw reflected . " You told us on Yiktor that bodies did not matter , that you were still Krip Vorlund . " " Yes , " I said when he paused , as if his words had a deep meaning to be seriously considered . " I am Krip Vorlund . Did I not prove it ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? That I had managed to masquerade successfully all these months among men who knew me intimately ? " Are you ? The Krip Vorlund , Free Trader , that we knew would not put an alien above his ship  --  or his duty ! " I was shaken . Not only because he would say and think such a thing of me , but because there was truth in it ! Krip Vorlund would not have left that squad on the cliff top
