Casual Acceptance <P> Sir : My initial feelings of horror and repulsion at the sight of the grinning soldier displaying his trophies of war Feb. 1 were soon overcome by acceptance ; is there really a difference between head counts and body counts ? The casual presentation of such carnage can not help but breed casual acceptance of such atrocities . <P> ( MRS . ) SUSAN H. HYDE Great Neck , N.Y . <P> Sir : Do we need any more proof that the world is indeed mad ? <P> <P> ROBERT E. FERGUSON JEFFREY S. NINTZEL Hanover , N.H. <P> <P> Sir : The insipid grin of degenerate pride in achievement on the face of the Cambodian soldier further illustrates the mindless futility of our involvement in Indochina . <P> Copies of the picture should be placed on the desk of every Government official with a mind and voice regarding the war . <P> JANET P. SOENEN Woodridge , Ill . <P> Sir : As shocking and grisly as the pictures are , you 've performed a service by showing them if they inspire a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and about the values of a nation that can not even play the national anthem at the end of a day 's television without showing uniformed soldiers marching and bombs bursting in air . Maybe some day patriotism will no longer be synonymous with militarism , and young men wo n't have to prove their love of their own country by taking over someone else 's homeland . <P> PATRICIA JOHNSON San Diego <P> Sir : Your taste and good sense are up for scrutiny ; in fact , TIME , I think you blew it . <P> MRS . GORDON V. TOLLEFSON Seattle <P> Sir : You will receive many letters scolding you for publishing the picture of the happy Cambodian soldier . Do n't change . We are all too ready to forget the most gruesome details of war . They should be held up to us as reminders , high as severed heads . <P> HOWARD C. WOLFE Los Angeles <P> Sir : Is it not ironic that Robert van Leer 's description of the Viet Cong torture of an American soldier is precisely the same as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over a person 's head ) described in Orwell 's 1984 ? <P> JAMES MCDOWALL Charleston , Ill . <P> <P> No More Heroes <P> Sir : In recent memory , no article has angered me more than " J.F.K. Revised " Feb. 1 . <P> The epic displays of Monday-morning quarterbacking are , unfortunately , barometers of our current paranoid scene . Why blame the Kennedy myth on Kennedy ? The American people created the myth . It was the last thing we did as a whole . <P> I have ceased to have heroes . They 're hard to find , especially in government . However , I remember those few years when my generation and the nation in general allowed itself to feel more hopeful than hopeless , the violent minority was a minority , and we believed that this nation could be on its way to better things . <P> NORMAN GERSHON Kansas City , Mo . <P> Sir : Jack Kennedy may have been daring , but foolhardy he was not . He may have been pragmatic , but he was never a cynic . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The trouble with Jack Kennedy 's inaugural address is that he had so little time to attempt to put it into practice and that we Americans have so little personal interest in picking up and carrying out his challenge of excellence , humanity and peace . <P> JAMES E.
