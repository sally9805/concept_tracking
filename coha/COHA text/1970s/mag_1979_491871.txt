WHEN I BUSTED OUT OF THE NAVY . II ' ve never been happier or more confident than I was that day in March 1916 , when I made my first sale to The Saturday Evening Post . Returning to New Rochelle with the good news , I rushed to my boardinghouse and hunted up Irene O'Connor , a schoolteacher who lived there , too . First I boasted . No more illustrations for children 's magazines  --  I had arrived . Two covers sold to the Post at 75 bucks apiece ! Three sketches O.K. 'd ! And all this on my first try ; I was standing on the threshold of wealth and fame . Then I asked Irene to marry me . She refused , saying she was engaged to an agricultural student at Michigan State . Then she changed her mind and accepted . We set a date , and I went to work on my third Post cover  --  an old man playing baseball with a bunch of kids . When I took it down to Philadelphia , there was trouble . Walter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ editor , Mr. George Horace Lorimer , thought the old man was too rough and tramplike . Would I do the painting over ? Of course . I went home , stretched a new canvas , and tried again . " Better , " said Mr. Dower . " Mr. Lorimer thought it was better . But the old man 's too old , he thought . " I did the painting over again , using a young man . The boy was too small . I posed and painted a larger kid . I did that painting over five times before Mr. Lorimer accepted it . By the time he finally O.K. 'd it , I had decided that doing Post covers was going to make my life more complicated than I had ex-petted . ( Mr. Lorimer later told me that he 'd been testing me . I wonder if he ever knew how near I came to flunking . ) My feelings were salved by my first fan mail . I got five or six letters on my first Post cover . Art directors of other magazines began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a humor magazine in those days and second in importance to the Post as an illustrator 's market . Most Life covers were jokes and had titles . For instance , I painted a picture of a Pilgrim boy being chased by Indians . Title : A Pilgrim 's Progress . Every Tuesday all the artists would gather to see John Ames Mitchell , the editor . As we entered the anteroom of his office , Miss Berry , the receptionist , would give each of us a little card with a number on it . Then we 'd all sit on a bench and wait for Miss Berry to call our number . While we waited , each one of us would open his portfolio and rearrange the drawings in it . I always started out by putting my best ideas last , so that Mr. Mitchell would look all through the portfolio . But when I sat down in the anteroom I 'd get cold feet and figure that Mr. Mitchell might become discouraged before he reached the good ideas and reject everything . So I 'd decide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for my number to be called . Fearing that someone might snitch my best ideas , I 'd open my portfolio a crack , reach in , and rearrange the drawings by pulling one on its end and shuffling the others around it . All the other artists were doing the same thing . We must have looked like aside show , all of us sitting in a line struggling with our drawings and glancing suspiciously at one another . About ten o'clock every Tuesday morning the door of the anteroom would slam open and James Montgomery Flagg , the tycoon of illustrating at that time , would hurry in . He 'd go right past us into Mr. Mitchell 's office without waiting for a number or even to be announced . We 'd hear shouts of greeting as the door closed . Half an hour or so would go by . Then suddenly , Flagg would rush out , slamming the door , and Miss Berry would begin to call our numbers . Next in importance after Life was Judge , another humor magazine . If Mr. Mitchell did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Judge . Then . if Judge rejected it , I 'd take it to Leslie 's . If they turned it down , I 'd crate it up and send it to The People 's Popular Monthly in Des Moines , Iowa . They paid a fraction of Post prices for covers ; it hardly took care of the cost of my models and material , but at least I did n't have to throw the drawing away . Very few of my drawings traveled as far as Des Moines . That year I did six Post covers and sold many paintings and drawings to Life , Judge , and Leslie 's . In short , I prospered ; so much so that I married Irene O'Connor in the fall . One week after we were married , Irene left to spend two months with her parents in Potsdam , New York , leaving me alone in the dingy third-floor apartment we had rented in New Rochelle . Our marriage was n't particularly unhappy , but it certainly did n't have any of the warmth and love of a real marriage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She was still in love with the agricultural student she had been engaged to . Maybe she had married me because my prospects were better . Not that she was n't an awfully nice girl ; she just made a mistake . After a while her mother and two brothers and sister came to live with us . When the first draft call of World War I was sent out , I was declared exempt . I do n't remember why ; maybe , with all my wife 's relatives , I had too many dependents . Still , I felt guilty , so when the authorities organized a harbor patrol in New Rochelle to guard the approaches to Fort Slocum , a big enlistment center , I joined up . Headquarters of the harbor patrol was an old bug-infested yawl anchored in the middle of Pelham Bay . One night a week I would report to the yawl with my friend Clyde Forsythe , the cartoonist . Our captain would assign us to a rowboat loaded with rifles and pistols , and we 'd row with muffled oarlocks about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ German submarines surfacing . All we ever intercepted was a rowboat carrying two women on their way to cheer up the boys at Fort Slocum . In the daytime , of course , I stuck to my easel . The papers were full of war news , and every headline suggested an idea for a cover . " French Population Cheers Doughboys " -1 did a magazine cover showing a little French girl inserting a poppy in an American soldier 's buttonhole . " Sergeant Awarded Croix de Guerre , Bussed by French General " -1 painted a startled doughboy being kissed on the cheek by a French general . Four other illustrators read the same news item and did covers on it . When four magazines came out in the same week with covers of a French general kissing a doughboy , everybody called up everybody else and threatened to sue . I was pretty well satisfied with myself , knocking out covers and illustrations for the Post , Country Gentleman , Leslie 's , Life , and Judge , enjoying my fan mail , and making quite a bit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I decided it was my duty to enlist . The doctors at Pelham Bay Naval Enlistment Headquarters rejected me because I was 17 pounds underweight for my height and age , so I caught a train to New York , to try again at an enlistment center at City Hall . The yeoman who weighed me there had been a student at the Art Students League . " You 've overdone the starving-artist bit , " he said . " We 'll have to talk to a doctor . " He led me into a dark little office and explained my problem to a doctor who was sitting with his feet up on a desk and smoking a cigar . " How much under is he ? " asked the doctor , looking thoughtfully at my nakedness . " Seventeen pounds , " said the yeoman . " Wo n't do , " said the doctor . " We can waive ten pounds but not seventeen . " The yeoman glanced furtively around . " How about the treatment ? " he whispered . " He do n't look big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I want to get in , " I said , shivering as chill drafts ran up and down my bare legs . " What 's the treatment ? " " Bananas , doughnuts , and water , " said the doctor . " You eat seven pounds ' worth , we waive the other ten pounds , and you 're in . " He pulled open a file drawer . It was filled with bananas and doughnuts . I eased onto an icy chair , my teeth chattering . The yeoman drew a pitcher of water at the wash basin in the corner . The doctor heaped bananas and doughnuts around it . " Go to it , " he said . I began to eat and drink . After a while I staggered to the scales  --  five pounds to go . So I ate some more and drank some more . The doctor 's cigar went out . The yeoman watched me intently . " I 'm going to burst , " I said . " I 'd better quit . " But the doctor and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; it was n't just one sailor more or less , it was their battle against the Kaiser and all his forces of darkness . " Come on , " said the doctor , peeling a banana , " four more doughnuts , and bananas , and more water . " I stuffed . And stuffed . And stuffed . The yeoman weighed me again . " We 've won ! " he shouted . I could hardly walk ; the seven pounds of doughnuts , bananas , and water sloshing about in my stomach threw me off balance . But I managed to struggle into my clothes and totter home . A few days later I was ordered to report to the Brooklyn Navy Yard , where I would embark for the base at Queenstown , Ireland . We sailed that night , but a warning that German submarines were lurking off the coast brought a change of course . The next morning we docked at Charleston , South Carolina . Flu was raging through the camp ; men were dying every day . Being shorthanded , the authorities assigned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got a piece of both . Guard duty was cold , damp , and frightening , but uneventful . I just stood in a mud puddle for four hours , scared of snakes , Germans , and my fellow guards , who would shoot at anything that made a noise . At dusk 12 of us were issued guns and marched off to the cemetery , behind a wagon laden with rough pine coffins . As each one was lowered into a grave , the officer said , " Readyaimfire , " and we firedbangety , bang , bang , bang ... bang . That last bang was me ; I hardly knew the butt of a rifle from the barrel . The next day I was assigned to the camp newspaper , Afloat and Ashore , to draw cartoons and make layouts two days a week . The rest of the time I could do my own work , as long as it was in some way related to the Navy . I painted a Post cover of one sailor showing another a picture of his girl , and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smiling soldiers , sailors , and marines . I drew countless portraits of officers and enlisted men . Of course , doing portraits of officers made my life less complicated . If I wanted a pass to town , I 'd just ask one of my sitters . He could hardly refuse ; I might have elongated his nose or weakened his chin . A few months later all the men in special services were alarmed to hear that a new commander had been appointed to the Charleston Naval Base . A sailor named O'Toole was discussing the situation with me one afternoon when the studio door was flung open , a voice yelled " ten-Shun ! " and in walked the new base commander , a big , handsome , beefy-looking fellow in dress uniform . His smartly dressed wife accompanied him . " Carry on , men , carry on , " he said . I went back to work on a portrait , and O'Toole fussed with a pile of old canvases in the corner . The new commander looked at the portrait on my easel , asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the new commander could be " got round , " but the wife worried him . The next day I was transferred to the commander 's personal staff and went to live on the U.S.S. Hartford , which had been Admiral Farragut 's flagship during the Civil War . Now it was moored in Charleston harbor as the official headquarters and residence of the commander of the Charleston Naval Base . The Hartford had been refurbished since its fighting days in Mobile Bay . A grand , red-carpeted staircase swept down to a ballroom decorated with hand-carved scrollwork . The staterooms , which were officers ' quarters , were hung with velvet tapestries . I shared a plush stateroom with a tenor and O'Toole , whom I had placed as chauffeur on the base-commander 's staff by drawing a portrait of the ensign in charge of transportation . When the commander entertained visiting dignitaries , the tenor sang and I displayed my work before the assembled guests . I soon learned that one of my jobs on the Hartford was to paint portraits of Captain Mark St. Clair Ellis and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ portraits of Captain Ellis , one in uniform and one in civilian clothes . All his ribbons had to be just so . He wanted his eyes to have just the right sparkle  --  lively , but dignified and stern . I was just finishing the second portrait when the false armistice burst upon us . Everyone knew the real thing was n't far off , and most of us applied for a discharge . To prevent a stampede , the Navy ruled that no honorable discharges were to be granted . All leaves were cancelled , too . Well , I wanted to get out real bad . So I told Captain Ellis that the only place in the country where truly beautiful frames could be bought was Knoedler 's in New York . " I can pick out just the right ones , " I said , " big , ornate , gold-leafed . They 'll make the portraits look marvelous . " He sent an aide to look up the rules on discharges . The aide reported that under the temporary order prohibiting honorable discharges , there were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at once : a dishonorable discharge or an " inaptitude " discharge . " Give him that inaptitude thing , " said Mrs. Ellis . " Good heavens ! " said Captain Ellis . " He ca n't go through life with an inaptitude discharge ! What 'll his friends say  --  that he 's a moron ? " " Do n't be silly , Mark , " said Mrs. Ellis , and she worked at him until he consented . On November 12 , 1918 , one day after the real armistice , I was discharged as unable to adapt myself to the duties of a " Landsman for Quartermaster " in the United States Naval Air Reserve . My service record reads : Discharged with Inaptitude Discharge . Rockwell is an artist and unaccustomed to hard manual labor . His patriotic impulse caused him to enlist in a rating for which he has no aptitude . Moreover , he is unsuited to Naval routine and hard work . And below this is the terse comment : I concur in the above statement . ( signed ) NORMAN ROCKWELL The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked them to ship three of their gaudiest frames to Captain Mark St. Clair Ellis at the Charleston Naval Base . Then I went home to New Rochelle , kissed Irene , and rushed out to look at my studio , which occupied the upper floor of a garage on Prospect Street . I fumbled my key into the lock , pushed open the door , and there it was , all 25 by 30 feet of it . My studio ! I was home again . My first thought was for the art directors . I had n't seen any of them for over a year . Did they remember me ? Would they give me work ? I have never practiced the art of gentle bribery with art directors  --  entertaining them at expensive restaurants , sending them gifts at Christmas . Still , after a year in the Navy , I felt that it would do no harm to be especially nice . I had been out of circulation a long time . Besides , it was about time I raised my prices . So I invited one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were living then in the smaller half of a two-family house . After we had finished dinner , the art director , Irene , and I sat in the living room , which Irene had fixed up prettily but simply . I gave the art director a cigar . Puffing away , he surveyed the room  --  the armchairs covered in gay prints , the sideboard with its modest display of silverplate , my pipe rack  --  a comfortable , unostentatious room . " Well , Norman , " he said , " now that I see how simply and inexpensively you live , I do n't agree that you should ask such a high price for your work . It 's not necessary . You do n't need it . Do n't corrupt your little home with riches . " It was a long while before I asked another art director to my house for dinner . I 'll entertain the art directors out , I thought ; it 'll be safer . I reserved a table at Bertolotti 's , a fashionable Italian restaurant , and then bought tickets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by George O'Connor , my brother-in-law , whom I 'd asked along because I did n't really know how to give someone a good time , I met the art director at Penn Station . I 'll call him Mr. X. He was a tall , handsome fellow , and well turned out . At Bertolotti 's our guest rapidly drank absinthe toasts to me , George , his editor , his magazine , the President of the United States , the Statue of Liberty , and " the grand old flag . " George and I took it easy with whiskey highballs . When we left the restaurant Mr. X was apparently under control , though he did abuse the waiter over the amount of the check ( I paid , of course ) . Then , during the first act at the Follies , he left his seat . A few minutes later an usher ran up to me and whispered that I 'd better come to the foyer because my friend was in trouble . I found Mr. X struggling with two policemen and shouting for justice , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that X had accused the men's-room , attendant of stealing a $20 bill out of his pocket . When the attendant denied it , X knocked him down and jumped on him . The policemen wanted to put X in jail , but I said that I could take care of him . George and I dragged X down the street to a restaurant to get him some coffee . When we put him in the revolving door of the restaurant he sat down , braced his feet , and refused to move . Nobody could go in or out . A crowd gathered . " Break the door down , " a man yelled . He shook his fist at X , who did n't budge . It was a long while before I asked another art director to dinner and the theater . I had a reason . I decided that I would let my work speak for me . If it deserved a high price , I 'd get it . If it did n't , I 'd take a lower price . I 've never had an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the buyer , so that I can see directly what he thinks of it . Showing your own work can be hard on shoe leather and sensitivity , but I think it 's the best way . That 's how I got my first cover assignments from the Post in 1916 . At first I dealt with the art editor . Later on he introduced me to the big boss , George Horace Lorimer . Mr. Lorimer had taken command of The Saturday Evening Post in 1899 , when circulation was down to almost nothing . In short order he made the Post the first great mass-circulation magazine and in the process became famous as an editor . He ran the Post with an iron hand , making the final decision on every story , O.K.'ing every cover , approving every article assignment . The Post was his magazine , and he thought it was the greatest one ever published . Mr. Lorimer had such a strong sense of what the public liked that he relied on his first impression of art and stories . I 'd show a cover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it two or three times . Then he 'd say , " Good , " and scrawl OKGHL on the side of it . That was that . " If it does n't strike me immediately , " he used to say , " I do n't want it . Neither does the public . They wo n't spend an hour figuring it out . It 's got to hit them . " Mr. Lorimer never O.K. 'd more than three of my ideas for Post covers at one time . If I showed him six , he 'd accept three . If I submitted eight , he 'd acceptthree . After I caught on , I used to sketch out five ideas , three I liked and two I did n't like . Mr. Lorimer would accept the three good ones and reject the others . I do n't think he would have O.K. 'd all five ideas if they had been submitted by Rembrandt . I always acted out my ideas for Mr. Lorimer . It was strenuous , but I felt it was the best way to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideas , one of an old cowboy sitting on a slab bench and dreaming of past exploits , one of a boy playing a flute while a ring of little animals danced around him , and three others , two of which I did n't care about . I would lay the five sketches on Mr. Lorimer 's desk . " This one 's an old cowboy , " I 'd say . " See his chaps , his spurs , and his ten-gallon hat ? Been on the range roping cattle , branding calves , for 40 years . Fought Indians maybe . Gambled , brawled , spent many nights under the stars around the campfire . " Then I 'd slump into a chair . " But now he 's old . All he has left is his memories . He 's dreaming of the old days now . " I 'd assume what I imagined was a sad , dreamy expression . " rye got the perfect model , " I 'd say , speaking out of the corner of my mouth so as not to disturb my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He 's got these huge , drooping mustaches and big , sad , dog eyes with heavy lids . Real doleful . What do you think ? " " Good , " Mr. Lorimer would say , and he 'd write OKGHL on the margin . Then I 'd point to another sketch . " Springtime . A little boy perched on a stump playing a flute . " I 'd sit on the edge of a chair , pull up my legs in agraceful pose and make believe I was blowing a flute . " The kid 's happy , it 's spring . The sun is warm on his neck ; the bees are buzzing in the flowers . Little animals are dancing in a ring around the stump , a rabbit , a duck , a frog . " I 'd kick up my heels and dance around the chair . " It 's spring ! Everybody 's joyful . " " Good , " Mr. Lorimer would say , scribbling OKGHL on the side of the sketch . Then I 'd mix in the two ideas that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without running commentary . " Bad , " Mr. Lorimer would say , with a note of triumph in his voice . Finally I 'd dramatize my third good idea , Mr. Lorimer would O.K. it , and I 'd leave , worn out but happy . I was first introduced to Mr. Lorimer about six months after being discharged from the Navy . He called me Norman from the start ; I called him Mr. Lorimer . Our relationship was cordial but businesslike . Then , in 1924 , the wealthy Patterson and McCormick interests founded Liberty , a national magazine to compete with the Post and Collier 's . The backers launched Liberty with great fanfare , hiring famous editors and enticing celebrated writers and artists away from Collier 's and the Post . The art director of Liberty came to my studio in New Rochelle and told me he would double whatever the Post was paying me if I would work exclusively for Liberty . I refused his offer . He said that he had been ordered to stay with me until I came around and sat there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while Irene dropped by . I explained the situation . " Of course you should go with Liberty , " she said . " Has Mr. Lorimer ever doubled your price ? You 've been working for him for eight years now , and all you get is measly little raises . " At suppertime I still had n't decided what to do . Irene left ; the art director said he 'd stay with me all night if necessary . At ten o'clock I excused myself , saying I had to go to the washroom , and sneaked off home and went to bed . But I could n't sleep ; early in the morning I caught a train to Philadelphia . Mrs. Bessie Riddell , successor to Mr. Dower as art editor , took me into Mr. Lorimer 's office . " Mr. Lorimer , " I said , " when I left the studio last night there was a man there from this new magazine called Liberty . He said he 'd double my price if I 'd work for them . " Mr. Lorimer stood up . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you going to do ? " I looked down at the desk , waiting , but Mr. Lorimer did n't say anything more . I noticed that he had his thumb pressed on the desk so hard that it was white . I looked up . His eyes were piercing . " Why , of course , Mr. Lorimer , I 'll stay with you , " I said . " All right , " he said , " I 'll double your price . " He would not have given a cent more to keep me , but after I had proved my loyalty to his magazine he showed me that the Post valued my work . The Post was his life , and he expected others to feel the same way . Those artists and writers who accepted Liberty 's offers were henceforth anathema to him . He refused to use their work or even look at it . They had been traitors to his magazine . After the crisis I became almost intimate with Mr. Lorimer , in a sort of father-son way . Whenever I went to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so . He was very patient with me . As my work increased in popularity , I took to signing my name larger and larger on my paintings . It was unconscious ; the signature just seemed to grow by itself . First , Norman Rockwell , then NORMAN ROCKWELL , then NORMAN ROCKWELL . Finally Mr. Lorimer suggested that I try to curb my signature . " Make it as large as you like , " he wrote , " but not larger than the title of the magazine . We must preserve proportion . You appear on the Post , not the Post on you . " I worked for Mr. Lorimer for over 20 years . Then , all of a sudden , he resigned from the Post . But I 'd better tell that story in its proper place .
