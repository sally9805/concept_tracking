CHILD 'S PLAY <P> Directed by SIDNEY LUMET <P> Screenplay by LEON PROCHNIK <P> Winter term at a Catholic boarding school for boys , and the students are restless . But this is no case of ordinary snowbound ennui , as eager young Gym Teacher Paul Reis ( Beau Bridges ) soon discovers . There have been " six student-caused accidents " in the winter term alone . Fingers have been mashed , brows bloodied , eyes gouged , as if the boys were all under the rule of some demoniac impulse . <P> Extracted with misplaced fidelity from Robert Marasco 's unfortunate 1970 Broadway success , this lame tale about the corruption of innocence is little more than a trot for Lord of the Flies . An unpopular Latin teacher nicknamed " Old Lash " ( James Mason ) is certain that all the trouble is caused by his colleague Dobbs ( Robert Preston ) , whom he describes as a " malevolence " and an " obscenity . " Dobbs , however , is beloved of all the boys and Lash heartily despised as an overbearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teachers leads eventually to madness , suicide and the equivocal triumph of evil , at least as far as the Code and Rating Administration will allow . <P> Beau Bridges is appropriately agitated throughout . Preston seems miscast , adept at being folksy and jolly but confounded when he is called upon to be sinister . Memories of The Music Man constantly intrude , and we keep expecting him to break into a chorus of Seventy-Six Trombones . James Mason is superb as a kind of misanthropic Mr. Chips . As written , the part is little more than a cartoon . Mason turns it into a full portrait of a frightened man in the process of being destroyed . <P> It is a performance of such stature that the rest of the movie looks scrawny beside it . In Fail Safe and The Deadly Affair , Lumet showed a strong and substantial flair for melodrama , but nearly everything seems to go wrong for him in Child 's Play , from Michael Small 's sonorous and silly score to the untidy accumulation of anticlimaxes left about by the scenarist . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
