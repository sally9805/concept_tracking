You never knew anything so nothing , Nichts , Nullus , niente , as the life here . Australians are always vaguely and meaninglessly on the go . That 's what the life in a new country does to you : it makes you so material , so outward , that your real inner life and your inner self dies out , and you clatter around like so many mechanical animals ... Yet the weird , unawakened country is wonderful ... <P> SO wrote British Novelist D.H . Lawrence to his wife 's sister in 1922 . Contemporary Australians could justifiably answer Lawrence with the words of another British author , Anthony Burgess , who recently wrote : " This great , empty continent must surely become the New New World , and it is significant that the accents of the disillusioned New World now mingle with the cheerful Dickensian cockney of Perth , Melbourne and Sydney ... The country breathes promise , and it is a wonderful place for bringing up big , brown , bare-toed children . " <P> The fact is that Australia 's reputation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an earlier age it was known as the resettling place for convicts-157,000 in all between 1788 and 1868 . Throughout its history , many foreigners have found it to be in Lawrence 's words " so hoary and lost , so unapproachable . " Even a few Australians have agreed . Every year some 6,000 of them leave home , mostly for Europe and America , and even today a large percentage of the best-known Australians are expatriates . Among them : Soprano Joan Sutherland , Dancer Robert Helpmann , Actress Zoe Caldwell , Actors Leo McKern and Rod Taylor , Writers Morris West and Alan Moorehead , Artist Sidney Nolan . <P> But lately , much of the traffic has been the other way . With the U.S. caught up in momentous internal problems , Australia has become the place that millions of Americans and Europeans consider the last beckoning frontier . A recent Gallup poll reported that 12% of the American people would like to move abroad , twice as many as in 1959 . Of that group , a third ( about 8,000,000 ) would choose Australia as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 14,000 have done so . The same poll revealed that 40% of the British people , 27% of the West Germans and 16% of the Hollanders would like to emigrate . Among the Britons and Hollanders , Australia was again the most popular choice . <P> What is the attraction ? Jobs are plentiful , as usual , and the country is riding the crest of a mining boom in the Northwest . Australia still throbs with zestful materialism . It is an egalitarian land with a relaxed , undemanding lifestyle . The big cities are all on the coasts , and three-quarters of the people live within an hour 's drive of a beach . Sydney , built around three harbors , sometimes seems almost water borne . " All my students seem seduced by sport and sun , " says a professor at the university in Perth , echoing the tribute of Poet Dorothea Mackellar to Australia as " the sunburned country ... the wide , brown land .
