 | Linda 's Extraordinary Triumph and Rebirth The moving story of a 19-year-old girl 's often terrifying journey along the frontiers of medical research A young intern at Vanderbilt University Hospital in Nashville , Tenn. , broke the news to me . " Linda , " he said , " you have a disease of too many white cells . " " Does this disease have a name ? " I asked . " Yes , " he said . " Leukemia . " THAT first evening at the hospital , on February 1 , 1973 , our 19-year-old ( laughter Linda 's white-cell count was 98,000 and climbing . A normal count ranges from 5000 to 10,000 . Our family physician , Dr. Ralph Massie , explained the situation to my wife Jeannine and me . " Linda has AML ? acute myelogenous leukemia , " he said . " It 's a terribly seri- ous illness . How long does she have ? A few months , perhaps a bit longer . With chemotherapy she may have a temporary remission . She will be terribly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will welcome it as a blessing . " Leukemia is a rare disease , striking about 21,000 Americans each year , and resulting in about 15,000 deaths . In Linda it had come quickly . That fall , whenever she was home from Memphis State University , she had seemed chronically enervated . In December she developed a hand tremor . A neurologist prescribed medication , but the tremor wors- 78 ened . Late in January she called from college to tell us she 'd been sick for a week . She suspected flu . " I feel horrible , " she said . It was then that doctors spotted the abnormal white-cell count . Dr. John Flexner , associate professor of medicine at Vanderbilt , who had taken charge of my case , asked to talk to Mom and Dad and me together . I was already too weak to walk , so they rolled me down to his office in a chair . I clung tightly to Mom 's hand , and she to mine , while Dr. Flexner delivered his prognosis . It was n't good . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mom finally asked . " Scientists all over the world are working on AML , " Dr. Flexner said . " But at this point there is no known cure . Right now , frankly , it would take a miracle . " Mom , who runs a newcomer welcoming service in Nashville , and Dad , who is news editor of Nashville 's morning newspaper , wept . I cried , too , but for them . I did n't want to see them sad because of me . And I told them ? and asked that they pass the word to anyone who planned to visit me ? to be happy . Because I was n't going to die . THEY put Linda on chemotherapy . In the weeks that followed she lost 30 pounds and had fevers , headaches , bleeding gums and constant nausea . Jeannine and I were deep into one of our dark , sleepless nights when I broached an idea spawned by desperation . Heart and kidney transplants were almost routine , I said . So why not bone-marrow transplants ? In my addled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and replacing it with mine . I ca n't account for what followed , but next day at the hospital Dr. Flexner sought Jeannine out . " I want to talk to you about a bone-marrow transplant for Linda , " he said . He told her about the University of Washington 's Adult Leukemia Center in Seattle . Since its founding in 1969 by Dr. E. Donnall Thomas , the center had performed a number of experimental marrow transplants . Most of the patients had died from infection , rejection of the new marrow or a recurrence of the disease . But some had survived . Of those who had , it was too early to predict long-term results ; certainly the odds were stacked in favor of leukemia . But if Linda were his daughter , he said , he would try Seattle . At first I did n't go for the idea of a transplant , because there were some days when I felt better . I was even allowed to go home for two weeks between treatments . But finally Dr. Flexner convinced me to try the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call came from the Adult Leukemia Center to say they were ready . Dad rented an apartment near the hospital in Seattle . Mom and Jan , my r8-year-old sister , flew out with me . Dr. Eliane Gluckman examined me first and explained the treatment and the ordeal I was to undergo . 1975 LINDA 'S EXTRAORDINARY TRIUMPH AND REBIRTH 79  | She told me I 'd be sterile if I survived . I thought it was a small price to pay for life itself . But when she said all of my shoulder-length hair would fall out because of the heavy dosage of drugs and irradiation I would receive , I bawled . WHEN Linda arrived in Seattle she was fading fast ; the doctors considered her life expectancy very short . The transplant was scheduled for May 11 . I had planned to work until the day before , then fly out . But on May 8 I received word that leukemic cells had invaded Linda 's brain . She was having convulsions . It was feared she would lapse into coma . I rushed home , picked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , our 14- and 15-year-old sons , in the hands of friends . Seattle was almost six hours away . As the office agnostic , I pray only on the sly ? which is what I did during those lonely hours on the plane . It was dusk and raining as the cabbie dropped me at the Seattle apartment . Dumping my bag , I ran the block to the hospital where the Adult Leukemia Center occupied two floors . Jeannine had tried to describe the informality to me over the telephone : how members of the families ran specimens down to the labs for the staff ; how everyone ? from doctor to janitor ? was on a first-name basis ; about the two restrooms that served families , patients and staff ; about the dinky rooms ; about the beautiful spirit of hope in the face of almost certain death . Jeannine and I donned surgical masks and entered Linda 's room . Jan , her eyes red-rimmed and swollen , was helping a nurse hold her thrashing sister on the bed . I spoke Linda 's name softly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , moans , wild stares . Her bed was soaked in sweat . I turned in helplessness to Dr. Klock ? Dr. John C. Klock of San Francisco , who had primary charge of Linda 's case . " What can I do ? " I asked . Dr. Klock escorted me to the hallway . He was only 27 , but fatigue and thinning dark hair had aged his finely chiseled features . He would , I learned later , remain near Linda 's bedside for 36 straight hour : . " I 'll explain what has gone on and what we hope to do later , " he said calmly . " Leukemic cells invaded Linda 's central nervous system late last night . We irradiated the left side of her brain this morning . Tomorrow morning the right side will be irradiated . We hope that this will kill the invading cells and that there will be no after-effects , such as blindness or brain damage . " Dr. Klock then briefly outlined the transplant procedure . Linda was being given large dosages of Cytoxan , a highly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the leukemic cells in her body down to a five-percent level and to suppress her immunological system so that the foreign marrow would find a hospitable home in which to grow . On Friday morning , May she would receive woo rads of total body irradiation  |p8o  from two cobalt sources , a lethal dose that in effect would halt the functioning of her own bone marrow . While Linda was undergoing irradiation , Dr. Klock explained , Jan ? who had been chosen as the marrow donor because her blood-cell and tissue type exactly matched Linda 's ? would be in surgery . Some 400 to 800 milliliters of marrow and blood would be extracted by needle from eight places in her pelvic bones . The marrow and blood would then be filtered and infused into one of Linda 's veins . There would be two to three critical weeks before learning if the marrow had been accepted ? and a total of too days of constant hospital care to determine if any stray leukemic cells had survived . The day before my transplant , another patient , wearing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room . " You 'll be taken to this building that 's two stories underground , " she said . " They have this giant cobalt machine . They 'll watch you on a TV screen . Everybody throws up . So when you feel like it , just raise your hand and they 'll stop the machine .... " I was determined not to upchuck next morning , and I did n't . They say I was the first . But , Lord , I made up for it when they returned me to the hospital . The least motion , moving in bed , batting my eyelashes , and I was seasick . It seemed as if I had been back in bed only a few minutes when a nurse walked in with a blood bag containing a pinkish fluid . It was fan 's mar- row . I lay there as the nurse hooked up the plastic bag to my IV rack . I watched with fascination as fan 's marrow began to inch , at pulse-beat jerks , down the long plastic tubing into my vein . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Linda had been given to suppress her rejection of Jan 's bone marrow now left her defenseless against germs . She developed a vaginal infection and began to hemorrhage . And then , a few days after the transplant , she was hit by pneumonia . Her temperature shot to 105.6 degrees , and she rattled the bed with chills so hard she had to be held down . Antibiotics were of little use . Linda needed blood platelets to help her blood clot and white cells to fight infection . I began donating the platelets daily ? a four-hour process . Blood was drawn and spun in a centrifuge to remove the platelets . Whole blood and plasma were returned . This was repeated until platelets had been removed from four pints of blood . After a week , Jan took over this chore . Rusty ( he and Cliff had flown to Seattle earlier ) was chosen to give the vital white cells . For seven days , five hours per day , blood was drawn out of Rusty 's body and into a centrifuge , where white cells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rusty . Day by day , despite our efforts , Linda wasted away . We dreaded the sound of a telephone ring in the 1975 LINDA 'S EXTRAORDINARY TRIUMPH AND REBIRTH 81  | night . Then , one day , Dr. Klock elatedly announced that Linda 's lungs were clearing . Rusty 's white cells had saved her . " I can tell you now , " said Dr. Klock , " that pneumonia kills over half of our patients . " My hair began coming out in swatches . It was messy . Hair in my bed , eyes , mouth , food . I looked like a freak . I lost all my hair ? except my eyebrows and eyelashes . Each day was a blurred sameness in which one pain blended with another , days of winning a smile if I could hold down two sips of Coke without throwing up , days of diarrhea , pills , shots , spinal taps , X rays ? and nights of fitful sleep . Dr. Klock dreaded lumbar-puncture time as much as I did . An LP needle is long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a lunar landscape of LP holes , each achieved to the accompaniment of screams . On day 21 post-transplant , Dr. Klock went into my hip in the hope that some marrow could be extracted , a futile effort up to now . As I lay sobbing as usual , I heard him exclaim , " We 've got some ! " To THE ordinary eye , it was a bloody mess that Dr. Klock spread on his slides . But to us it was rose blossoms . The slides showed that Jan 's transplanted marrow was blooming in Linda ? and it was clear of leukemic cells ! One golden afternoon Dad pulled a mirror of the wall and held it so I could see out the window . The Cascade Range , snow-covered yearround , shimmered into view , one peak like a giant sundae with blueberry syrup spilling down . After a month I could sit on the side of the bed , and then in a chair by the bed , for a few minutes at a time . I still could n't hold down any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a tube inserted surgically into my chest . Finally , I got my wheels back , and one day I was rolled into a nursing station from which I could look out the window and see our apartment . But what really grabbed me was the sight of Mount Rainier , its 14,000-foot peak hidden in the clouds ! AFTER six weeks in Seattle , I returned to Nashville . And on July 7 I received the most beautiful letter of my life . Dear Dad , it read , I 'm so sick of this place I could scream . I 'll be so glad when I get home . I feel like I 'm starving to death , but still ca n't have anything to eat . I love you . Linda . Whenever Linda had flirted with death , she had insisted she was fine . Now she was complaining . I knew she was getting better . As Linda took tiny steps toward the magic number of day zoo posttransplant ? the day she would be dismissed from the hospital if found free of leukemia ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the one before .. . 89 ... 90 ... 91 .... On day Too the phone rang . It was Jeannine , fairly squealing with de- light . " Linda got her last bone-marrow test today , " she said , " and it was all clear . We 'll be home on the 21st ! " The big day finally arrived , and at 9:30 in the evening Linda 's flight rolled to a halt at the Nashville airport . A kingsize sign reading WELCOME HOME LINDA AND JAN HONICKER served as a backdrop for the whooping , weeping and clapping of the faithful dozens who had come out to greet her . Linda was framed in the fuselage window , and I could read a big grin even through the sterile protection of her blue surgical mask . The wet eyes , the choked laughter as she made her way slowly down the jet ramp in a mini-dress and sandals , and collapsed in my arms , said it all . She was home . She had licked the Big One .

With happy tears flowing , they choked out : l variation on an old song : " Happy rebirthday to you . Happy rebirthday to you . Happy rebirthday , dear Linda . Happy rebirthday to you . " For indeed , Linda had been reborn , a year ago to the day . DOCTORS in Seattle gave Linda a weeklong examination last August , and pronounced her in excellent health . She takes no medication other than vitamin and mineral capsules . She is working and leading a normal life . No one can predict the future , of course . But every medical sign indicates that Linda has won her battle against leukemia.
