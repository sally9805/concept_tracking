ON A WARM NIGH1 in San Francisco , Alice Cooper was running his fingers through his hair and watching a Danny Kaye movie on television . Alice is a male rock and roll singer , enjoying for the moment the rewards of sudden and gigantic success . He was drinking a Coors Beer from the bottle as he stared at the tube in the living room of a suite in the Fairmont Hotel . Shep Gordon , manager of the Alice Cooper band , came out of one of the bedrooms , carrying a briefcase . He opened the case and pulled out a newspaper clipping . " Alice , " he said , " I have something you 're going to love . " The clipping was from the front page of the Charlotte ( N.C. I News . Alice put his beer bottle down and began to read . The Danny Kaye movie blared on . The newspaper story caused Alice to laugh . Bob Greene , twenty-four , writes u general ante for the Chicago Sun-Times . His first book , published last year , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Angels on the Wall of Heartbreak Hotel , and Other Reports from " Well , " said Shep Gordon , " how do you like it ?

" Gordon retrieved the clipping and in Ilia kripfraqp " I that newspaper , " he said . " I told them I could n't thank them enough . I told them I could n't have written a better story myself . " But by this time Alice Cooper was being drawn back to the televised movie . - We 'll be leaving for the show in about forty-five minutes , " Gordon said . Alice nodded , his eyes locked on the screen , taking another pull from his beer . l N THE DRESSING ROOM of the Ber- keley Community Theater , the Alice Cooper band waited to go on stage .

In the dressing room Alice II painted evil-looking black spit shapes around his eyes , and he h drawn sharp fangs from the corn , of his mouth . He wore thigh-hi black leather boots and a rim black leotard . Across his chest , name " Alice " was written in sequi The other members of the bane guitarists Mike Bruce , Dennis Dunaway , and Glen Buxton , and drummer Neal Smith ? were dressed in bright one-piece uniforms made of simulated foil . Their fingernails were extremely long and covered with dark polish . Their hair was tremendously long , even by rock and roll standards . Out front , the kids were clamor ing . " And now , " the announcer screamed , " the most exciting group in the world ? the legendary Alice Cooper ! " They ran on stage and went through the some routine they perform virtually every working night . The music is solid rock and roll . But with the music alone , this would be just another band trying to make it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ band rich . S SOON AS THE CROWD sees Alice , /A they rush toward the stage . By the time he is into the opening song , " Be My Lover , " they are just inches from him . As he sings , he unsheathes a long sword and swings it over their . heads . They do not flinch as the sharp blade flashes past them ; they stare , fascinated . Alice brings a glob of spit from deep in his throat and it sails out into the audience . They are repelled and thrilled at the same time ; the band apparently holds to no conventions at all . Alice goes behind an amplifier and brings out a long , mean-looking boa constrictor . He holds it near the first row of fans . The snake 's tongue whips in and out of its mouth . Alice winds it around his neck . He kisses the snake . He lets it stick its head in his mouth . He sticks it between his legs . He dangles it over the audience . They are breathing hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The band begins to play a loud , hard song called " Dead Babies . " Alice comes to the front of the stage with a cute baby doll . The song is about a baby who ate a bottle of aspirin and died . As he sings the words , he fondles the doll , rubbing it across his body . He slowly undresses it , playing with it as he does so . Then the music quickens , and he tears at the doll 's dress , ripping He begins to tear the doll apart . r'He slams it to the floor , turns around , and raises a hatchet above his head . The sounds of a crying baby are heard from a Again and again and again he chops at the doll ; fake blood turns the stage floor red . All the while he is singing . And the little girls in the audience are singing too ; their eyes shine as they watch Alice kill the baby doll , and they sing along with him , " Goodbye , little Betty . . . so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doll , Alice places its head on top of a microphone stand . It rests there , obscene and taunting , as he flails a whip out over the audience . Some reach for him ; he kicks out at them and spits some more . Then the lights go off . Smoke fills the stage as the lights come back on . The rest of the band dons hangmen 's masks . The music continues . They drag Alice , crying and kicking , to the side of the stage . There is a genuine gallows , massive and ugly . They hit at Alice as they carry him up the stairs to the platform and fasten the noose around his neck . He begs them to stop . They do not . They pull a lever ; the floor under Alice opens , and he plunges downward . The noise is overwhelming as the young fans scream and shout with excitement . The lights go down again . Within minutes Alice and the band are back , singing , " We 've Still Got a Long Way To Go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swarming crowd . He throws one , then another , then another and another and another . The kids begin to fight for the posters . They hit at each other and swing and scratch at the people next to them . Girls faint , but there is no room for them to fall . Everyone in the auditorium is coming toward the stage . The unlucky ones , passed out on their feet , are pummeled from every side . Alice , laughing , continues to throw posters . When it seems that it can get no worse . Alice brings out his last trick . He brandishes the sword again , but this time there are dollar bills strung on it , from handle to tip . " Do you like money ? " he screams . They roar and push forward once again . " How much do you like money ? " he screams , and thrusts the sword at them . They leap at it , the last barriers down . They do not know why they are up here , fighting for the stage . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how this night at the Berkeley Community Theater ended , alias and ilia hand ran offstage and into the dressing room . They wanted to hurry and he gone ; the limousines would take them to a local pizza parlor , where Warner Brothers Records was giving a party , complete with a stripper and free drinks . E VERYONE IS TRYING to convince people that kids are interested in ecology , that kids are interested in politics , " Alice Cooper said . " That 's bullshit . Kids are interested in the same things that have always excited them ; sex and violence . That 's what they want , that 's what they 'll pay to see . " Alice was in another motel mon-. in another town , drinking another beer and looking at another tele. vision screen . " You know , when I was a kid , I used to go to the movie : every Saturday afternoon , " he said If it was a funny movie or a love story , I 'd go home with the vagur feeling that I 'd been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scare ( the hell out of me ? man , I 'd Loy ' that , " So I think it 's good if the kid are disgusted or frightened by ou show . Because inside , it turns ther on , they love it , they have to see ii They wo n't go home and shrug thei shoulders ; they 'll talk to thei friends about it , they 'll try to figur it out , they 'll wonder if we all g back and go to sleep in coffins aft the show . They 'll be fascinated . " Offstage Alice is a quiet youn man . He and his band have put tF show together with a deliberate pu pose , and the purpose is beir achieved . But the thinking was done long ago , the dead-babies id , and everything else . Now it is on the people in the anonymous tow who have the spontaneity for or rage . For the Cooper people , it is matter of logistics and mundane Ina ries . How much time do we have IP make it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feed to t snake ? Has the gallows been to down and prepared for shipmei Has someone filled tonight 's ba doll with fake blood ? Are tl-A enough posters to inflame the au ence with ? These are the proble that are important at this stage : more complex questions have b. forgotten by the band long ago . they know is that the kids are corn to see them , and the money is pil up . ( They can begin to afford lu ries ; in San Francisco , for two days at the Fairmont , the hotel bill for the band amounted to $1,700.1 " All these rock groups are talking about getting into politics . " Alice said . " That 's so stupid . Politics is boring , I hate it . Rock and roll is political by its very nature it 's anti-parent , and that 's a political statement in itself . You do n't have to go beyond that . " Alice says he is repelled by random , offstage violence ; he hates the thought of getting into a fistfight . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occurred to him by accident . 1 " We were doing an outdoor show a long time ago , " he said . " This chicken wandered onto the stage . I picked it up ; I figured it could fly , so I tossed it into the air . But chickens , you know , they ca n't fly , it turns out . It came down and it broke its neck . I did n't know what to do . Su I kind of tossed it into the audience . You know what those kids did ? They tore it apart , just ripped it to shreds ! The kids were just like a pack of piranhas . It was amazing to see . It taught me a lot . " Then all these rumors started to spread , like that we killed chickens onstage every night , and drank the blood . Never happened . It just hapoened that one time with the chick-'n , and we did n't drink any blood . 3ut we could n't convince people , and are began to figure that 's the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; ot to Atlanta a couple of weeks ago . here was a court injunction waiting or us .

Cadillacs were waiting to take the hand to the headquarters of Warner Brothers Records , where gold albums were to be presented to the group for their LP , " Killer . " But when the band arrived , Warner 's president Mo Ostin , and executive vice-president Joe Smith were both out to lunch . The band walked into Ostin 's private office anyway . " Look at this , " said Dennis Dunaway . " He 's got one of those happy face notepads . " " Give it to me , " said Neal Smith . " Let 's burn it . " An autographed picture of Frank Sinatra hung on the wall . Alice sat directly beneath it . A secretary came in and asked the band to move to Joe Smith 's office , which they did . Road manager Dave Lihert brought in a boxful of drive-in tacos , and the band spread the food over the carpet as they reclined to eat . Which is what was happening when Smith and Os-tin came in . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joe Smith . He said it out loud , but he was talking to himself . " They 're all over my office and they have tacos all over the place . " Ostin and Smith behaved as you might expect them to behave . They are middle-aged men who make their livings off the appeal of singers half their age ; they live very comfortably because of it , but there is still something wrong . So they were full of overly friendly good cheer as they greeted the hand and made loud jokes . When the band lined up for promotional photographs , holding framed gold albums , Joe Smith and Mo Ostin pushed into the picture . " Let 's all put our arms around each other , " Smith said . " What are you trying to do , make us look like homosexuals ? " said Alice Cooper . After the picture-taking , time limousines took the hand to the Continental Hyatt House on Sunset Strip . The girl from the plane was in the lobby . She had come straight from the funeral . and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the elevator together . PERFORMING ARTS AIN HOUR LATER , a middle-aged INcouple bustled through the hotel 's revolving doors . They looked like any other middle-aged couple on vacation in California ; maybe a little straighter than most . The woman looked at the wall behind the registration desk , where a clerk had pinned up a photograph of Alice Cooper in full makeup and costume . " Oh , look at that , " the woman said . " They 've got Vince 's picture up . " Alice Cooper 's parents . ' They called his room on a house phone , then walked to a couch to wait until he came downstairs . His mother was carrying an envelope that was in. scribed , " Happy Birthday Vince . " " We still call him that , " she said . -I do n't know , I just ca n't call him Alice . Mothers are funny , I guess . ' They were from Phoenix , Arizona The father is a minister . Their last name is not Cooper , and many w their neighbors do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I understand why they do tht things they do , " the mother said " There arc so many groups today you have to attract attention the bes way you can . I keep hoping tha when they feel they 've really made it they 'll go back to more normal type of entertainment . " I love to watch the show . Vine has explained it all to me . The whol dead-babies routine is a warning t parents that they should not abus their children . That 's why they han Vince after he does it ; to show the lie should he punished . I 'm just son it 's my son who has to take the blam " Of course , sometimes it ge pretty frightening . The audience , e pecially . But we 're pr .. , ud . Mothe are like that . Sometime I get scan for him , though . You do n't rcali how many crazy , weird people a running around these days . " Alice came off the elevator hurried to his mother and fatiu " Twenty-four , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ c Alice smiled . " I know , Mom , ' , said , " I 'm getting up there . " His father moved close to hi " What 's that we read about kiuf down South ? " the father asked . " Oh , that Atlanta thing , " Al said . " Nothing happened . It was j a rumor . " " We thought so , Vince , " mother said . - We know not to heli what we read about you . " Later that evening , after a performance more frenzied than most , the band was toweling uff in the dressing room when the door opened and Alice 's parents entered with another middle-aged couple . Alice called to them : " Mom ! Dad ! Uncle Lefty ! Aunt Sue ! " Things got quiet for a moment . No one seemed to know what to say . Finally , speaking of the evening performance , Alice 's mother said : " It was a goodie , Vince . " Alice 's father shook his son ' : hand . Aunt Sue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Uncle Lefty just gazed at hi : nephew for a few moments . Th ? makeup was still on , and the " Alice ' sequins shone brightly on the chess of the leotard . " I try . Vince , " Uncle Lefty said " I try to understand , Vince , I real ' ) do . " THE JET WAS ON ITS WAY to Sacra mento . On hoard , the band wa ! playing blackjack , killing time unti their contract called for them to take the stage again and titillate mon thousands of California children . Of course , everyone on the plan was staring i at them . That alway happens . But one little girl was star ing especially intently , like a bir watching a snake . She was about fi : teen , blond and scrubbed and eve innocent looking . She knew wh these people were : she had listene to the albums and heard the rumor about the shows , although she ha never seen an Alice Cooper perforu ance . But she had never thought sl would see them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horrid thin ; she had heard , and here she was the plane with them , and they scenic fairly subdued and almost human . The stewardess handed the Litt girl a can of soft drink . She began drink from it , at the same time n letting her eyes move from Ali Cooper and Mike Bruce . She brought the can to her mou again . and just as she was swallowi the soda , Mike Bruce leaned over her . " I just read in the paper whf that stuff causes cancer in rats , " said calmly . The girl choked on the drink Bruce turned around and Al Cooper dealt him another card .
