Richard Nixon 's final bout with British Interviewer David Frost last week concluded , as had the first of the four telecasts , with a discussion of what the ex-President described as the " shattering experience " of his resignation . In coming full circle , the series-which had been sold separately to 162 U.S. television stations-lost half of its viewers , according to rating surveys in New York City and Los Angeles . Only about 21% of the TV audience watched the fourth interview , v. 42% for the first ; 23% for the second ; 17% the third . Among the topics in Nixon-Frost IV : <P> CHILE . Nixon defended his efforts to undermine Chile 's elected Marxist President Salvador Allende . Said he : " There was n't any question about his turning all the screws he possibly could in the direction of making Chile a Marxist state ... There was n't any question that Chile was being used by some of Castro 's agents as a base to export terrorism to Argentina , to Bolivia , to Brazil . " When Frost responded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his U.S.-supported successor General Augusto Pinochet Ugarte , Nixon pointed at Frost and replied , " The right-wing dictatorship , if it is not exporting its revolution , if it is not interfering with its neighbors ... is of no security concern to us . It is of a human rights concern . A left-wing dictatorship , on the other hand-we find that they do engage in trying to export their subversion to other countries . " <P> SPIRO AGNEW . Nixon revealed that he had been unwilling to rely solely on the recommendations of Attorney General Elliot Richardson after an investigation was begun of kickbacks paid by Maryland contractors to his Vice President . Nixon asked that Assistant Attorney General Henry Petersen , a Democrat , make his own investigation of the case . " There was no secret Richardson and Agnew did n't like each other . There was no secret that Richardson had ambitions to be Vice President or President in 1976 , and earlier if possible . " After Petersen concurred that the charges would lead to a recommendation of a prison sentence , Nixon said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right under the tremendous pressures that were developing there in the media and the rest-that there would be a kangaroo court where he 'd have no chance and serve a prison term , that he ought to take the steps that would lead to a settlement of the matter without a prison term .
