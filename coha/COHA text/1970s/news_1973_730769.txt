" Public officials can not es- : cape scrutiny because of their : position , " he said . " It is the responsibility of those in public office to be even more circumspect than ordinary citizens . Violations of law by those in a position of public trust have been eroding public confidence in our system of justice . " Where there is crime , it can not be ignored . When a prosecutor does ignore official corruption , his refusal to act may . justly be considered politicallymotivated. "  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
