txt WASHINGTON  --  President Carter has indicated to aides that he will support legislation lowering the Social Security payroll tax if Congress approves his proposed crude oil tax and uses the proceeds to finance the Social Security deficit , sources said Friday . Otherwise , they said , the President is opposed to tinkering with the 197 ' 7 law ? which boosts the payroll tax sharply over the next 10 years  --  on grounds that the cure might be worse than the disease . Tying the Social Security tax reduction to the crude oil tax is considered " a long shot because the crude oil tax is in trouble , " an administration official said . But , he added , " It is the one thing he has indicated he might accept . " CARTER HAS proposed the erode oil tax as the key part of his energy tax . He would rebate these taxes to consumers . But , if Congress went along , he would agree to use these rebates to bolster the Social Security system if the payroll tax is lowered . Such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting the energy bill through Congress and lowering the politically sensitive payroll tax . Rep. Al Ullman CD. , Ore , chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee , is said to favor such a proposal . But White House aides said they are not sure how far such a proposal needs to go . BARRY BOSWORTH , head of the President 's Council on Wage-Price Stability , recently proposed that Carter support reduction of the payroll tax as part of a new anti-inflaflon Initiative . He dropped the idea when administration officials said the President was n't ready to yield so easily to political pr6ssure from Capitol Hill . " There is a real question whether there is a taxpayer revolt on the Social Semi- ? 6ty issue , " one White House source // // Budget chief sworn in James smiles as he looks over the shoulder of President Carter during a White House ceremony Friday in which he was sworn in as director of the Office of Management and Budget . , who has been acting director since last December , replaces Bert Lance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ payroll tax cut // said . " Our mail does n't show it . Our telephone calls do n't show it . I 'm not so sure that the mall and telephone calls of members of Congress show it either . " WHITE HOUSE officials believe a major reason for Congress ' rush to overturn the Social Security tax rate increase was the volume of complaints they received when they went home over the Christmas holidays . They believe the complaints are concentrated in a small but articulate weltto-do and powerful minority . They believe the protests may disappear with time . The people most affected by the payroll tax are those earning more than $20,000 a year . Although news stories have indicated that the total tax bite would triple over the next 10 years , an official said the opposition ignores the fact that income will be increasing at the same time , so that the additional pinch will not be felt seriously .

Meanwhile , officials said the attack on inflation now being considered by the President is a modest proposal that has been blown out of proportion . ' " We 're not making any basic changes in our anti-inflation strategy , " one said . " This thing has been hyped to death . " A key point of the plan is a Carter proposal to put a 4 or 5 per cent limit on federal pay increases as a symbolic move to restrain spending . OTHER STEPS call for expansion of the timber harvest on federal lands to hold down lumber prices and a plea for congressional approval of the President 's plan to hold down hospital costs . A proposal to expand meat imports has been all but shelved . To protect the dollar , Treasury Secretary Michael Blumenthal has called for a $5-to-$6-tax on imported oil if Congress does n't approve the crude oil tax . Blumenthal reportedly has urged the President to act within a month @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Federal Reserve Chairman William Miller urged a similar step a few days ago .
