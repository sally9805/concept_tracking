In a fuel-short world that is turning colder , anxious men generated their own kinds of heat last week . Governments on both sides of the Atlantic imposed tough new constraints on industry and citizens . Britain prepared to go on a three-day work week and took other measures that Prime Minister Edward Heath said would give the nation " a harder Christmas than we have known since the war " ( see THE WORLD ) . In the U.S. , airlines drafted plans to drop a fifth of their flights next month , and a series of protests against the fuel cutbacks-by pilots , truck drivers , gas-station owners - gave a tinge of anarchy to the week 's events . All the while , the Arabs deepened the chill by announcing further oil-output reductions . <P> In Washington , the Government moved with a new purpose and direction . Acting with what for it was blinding speed , the House passed the energy emergency bill , disposing of scores of amendments in three days of debate . The bill still faces a prickly conference to reconcile Senate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to order rationing and other conservation steps subject to a congressional veto within 15 days ; the House would place far more stringent constraints on the White House ) . It should become law very quickly . The Senate gave industry some new mandates ; it passed a bill that would force manufacturers within 15 months to paste " energy efficiency " labels on all major household appliances . Longer range , the Senate bill would compel automakers by 1984 to increase fuel economy by an average of 50% or more over that of 1974 models . <P> Parking by Number . Energy Czar William Simon wasted no time waiting for Congress to grant him new powers . At midweek he issued a set of energy marching orders , some of which can take effect only when the energy emergency bill becomes law . Under his ukase , lighting inside all commercial and industrial buildings will be dimmed . Simon also proposed that lights on major highways go off except at ramps and interchanges . Limousines and heavy sedans will be taken away from every federal official except President Nixon and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ driven 20% fewer miles . Parking space in Government lots will be assigned not by rank but by the number of passengers arriving in each car . Surveillance will be placed on petroleum exports , which are minuscule in proportion to U.S. consumption but a prime source of suspicion to skeptics who still see the energy shortage as a plot . <P> <P> Simon also announced a revised set of allocations , put together hastily by his Federal Energy Office to meet a Congress-set deadline . They contained one monumental blooper : as originally put forth , the regulations would have forced refineries to cut gasoline production 25% . After a day of scare headlines and stock market rout , the FEO confessed its error and announced that it would really order only a 5% reduction , based on 1972 levels .
