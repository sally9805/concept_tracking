It could change forever the relationships between husbands and wives , witnesses and juries , political leaders and voters , businessmen and customers . It could sharply reduce the output of talk all over by making everyone think twice before speaking . It could also bring closer the Orwellian society of 1984 . The remarkable but ominous device that might cause these changes is the P.S.E. ( for Psychological Stress Evaluator ) which , its inventors believe , can use voice recordings to detect lies without the cooperation or even the presence of the speaker . <P> The new lie detector is a creation of Dektor Counterintelligence and Security , Inc. of Springfield , Va . It uses an ordinary tape recording of a voice on radio or TV or in any of the numerous settings where lies may be told : in a police station , perhaps , at a press conference , on the speaker 's platform at a political meeting , or in the bedroom of a married-or unmarried couple . The tape is fed into a machine that measures muscular micro-tremors in the voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice box and cause slight changes in pitch . Changes are not detectable by ear , but they can be traced on a chart by a pen linked to the machine . It is the capacity to detect and reproduce these tremors-apparently produced by the freely undulating throat muscles of a relaxed speaker-that gives the P.S.E. its awesome powers . For the throat muscles of a person under stress are so tense that they produce practically no microtremors . <P> Government intelligence agencies have already bought four of the machines ( at $3,200 each ) , allegedly for testing purposes only . Also , by agreement of prosecution and defense , the P.S.E. has been used in four Maryland court cases . In three , negative findings by the device led to dropping one murder and two bad-check charges ; in the fourth case , a positive report ensured conviction in a shoplifting incident . In addition , Dektor reports that it has monitored the TV program To Tell the Truth and been 94.7% successful in finding out who the truth tellers really were . <P> P.S.E. 's reliability still has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the company 's TV experiment . Moreover , some lie detector experts caution that the weakness of the stress evaluator may lie in its dependence on a single measure of bodily function ( the polygraph , or conventional lie detector , records several : pulse rate , blood pressure , respiration and sweat-gland activity ) . Besides , experts agree that although both the old and new devices can spot stress , neither can prove absolutely that the stress results from lying . The most serious objection to the P.S.E. is ethical . As the company itself suggests , the machine can be used covertly , thus invading the privacy to which , presumably , even liars are entitled .
