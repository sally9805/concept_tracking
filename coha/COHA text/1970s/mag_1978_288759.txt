With a thinking pen , he has transmuted illustrations into museum pieces <P> " The life of the creative man is led , directed and controlled by boredom . Avoiding boredom is one of our most important purposes . It is also one of the most difficult , because the amusement always has to be newer and on a higher level . So we are on a kind of spiral The higher you go , the narrower the circle . As you go ahead the field of choice becomes more meager , in terms of self-entertainment . In the end , working is good because it is the last refuge of the man who wants to be amused . Not everything that amused me in the past amuses me so much any more . " - Saul Steinberg <P> The artist is 64 this year : a solid , wiry man , rabbinically delicate in gesture and as immobile in repose as a large tabby cat .

That he remains an art-world outsider is a problem that critical thinking in art must compel itself to confront . " That showdown is about to begin . This week an exhibition of 258 drawings , watercolors , paintings and assemblages by Steinberg opens at New York City 's Whitney Museum , accompanied by a book ( Saul Steinberg ; Knopf ; $10.95 softcover ) with critical appraisal of the artist by Rosenberg . <P> Steinberg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refugee , a man of masks , languages and doctored identities , through whom the world 's multiplicity is refracted as by a prism . In America , he is both outsider and insider : only he could have dreamed up the poster that summarizes the Manhattanite 's provincial view of America : Ninth and Tenth avenues wide in the foreground , a strip of Hudson River , a smaller strip of New Jersey , and in the background a few scattered cities-Los Angeles , Las Vegas , Chicago-with Japan and China in the distance . <P> The focus does not quite work the other way . Most Americans may never have heard of Steinberg , but the influence of that clear , epigrammatic line and dry wit has been felt throughout American design and illustration for almost two generations .
