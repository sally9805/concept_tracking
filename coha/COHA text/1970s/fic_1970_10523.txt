and Mrs. Otto Bentwood drew out their chairs simultancously . As he sat down , Otto regarded the straw basket which held slices of French bread , an earthenware casserole filled with sauteed chicken livers , peeled and sliced tomatoes on an oval willowware platter Sophie had found in a Brooklyn Heights antiqueshop , and risotto Milanese in a green ceramic bowl . A Strong light , somewhat softened by the stained glass of a Tiffany shade , fell upon this repast . A few feet away from the dining room table , an oblong of white , the reflection from a fluorescent tube over a stainless-steel sink , lay upon the floor in front of the entrance to the kitchen . The old sliding doors that had once separated the two first-floor rooms had long since been removed , so that by turning slightly the Bentwoods could glance down the length of their living room where , at this hour , a standing lamp with a shade like half a white sphere was always lit , and they could , if they chose , view the old cedar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among other volumes , the complete works of Goethe and two shelves of French poets , and the highly polishedcorner of a Victorian secretary . Otto unfolded a large linen napkin with deliberation . " The cat is back , " said Sophie . " Are you surprised ? " Otto asked . " What did you expect ? " Sophie looked beyond Otto 's shoulder at the glass door that opened onto a small wooden stoop , suspended above the back yard like a crow 's nest . The cat was rubbing its scruffy , halfarvedbody against the base of the door with soft insistence . Its gray fur , the gray of tree fungus , was faintly striped . Its headp4was massive , a pumpkin , jowled and unprincipled and grotesque . " Stop watching it , " Otto said . " You should n't have fed it in the first place . " " I suppose . " " We 'll have to call the A.S.P.C.A. " " Poor thing . " " It does very well for itself . All those cats do well . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " These livers are good , " he said . " I do n't see that it matters whether they survive or not . " The cat flung itself against the door . " Ignore it , " Otto said . " Do you want all the wild cats in Brooklyn holding a food vigil on our porch ? Think what they do to the garden ! I saw one catch a bird the other day . They 're not pussycats , you know . They 're thugs . " " Look how late the light stays now ! " " The days are getting longer . I hope the locals do n't start up with their goddamn bongos . Perhaps it will rain the way it did last spring . " " Will you want coffee ? " " Tea . The rain locks them in . " " The rain 's not on your side , Otto ! " He smiled . " Yes , it is . " She did not smile at him . When she went to the kitchen , Otto quickly turned toward the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head against the glass . " Ugly bastard ! " Otto muttered . The cat looked at him , then its eyes flicked away . The house felt powerfully solid to him ; the sense of that solidity was like a hand placed firmly in the small of his back . Across the yard , past the cat 's agitated movements , he saw the rear windowsof the houses on the slum street . Some windows had rags tacked across them , others , sheets of transparent plastic . From the sill of one , a blue blanket dangled . There was a long tear inp5the middle of it through which he could see the faded pink brick of the wall . The tattered end of the blanket just touched the top frame of a door which , as Otto was about to turn away , opened . A fat elderly woman in a bathrobe shouldered her way out into the yard and emptied a large paper sack over the ground . She stared down at the garbage for a moment , then shuffled back inside . Sophie returned with cups @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Otto said . " He told me two more houses have been sold over there . " He gestured toward the rear windows with his hand . Out of the corner of his eye , he saw the at leap as though he had offered it something . " What happens to the people in them when the houses are bought ? Where do they go ? I always wonder about that . " " I do n't know . Too many people everywhere . " " Who bought the houses ? " " A brave pioneer from Wall Street . And the other , I think , a painter who got evicted from his loft on Lower Broadway . " " It does n't take courage . It takes cash . " " The rice is wonderful , Sophie . " " Look ! He 's curled up on that little ledge . How can he fit himself into such a small space ? " " They 're like snakes . " " ( ) tto , I 'll just give him a little milk . I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But he 's here now . We 'll be going out to Flynders in June . By the time we come home , he 'll have found someone else . " " Why do you persist ? It 's self-indulgence . Look ! You do n't mind at all as long as you do n't have to see the cat looking starved . That goddamn woman just dumped her evening load of garbage over there . Why does n't the cat go there to eat ? " " I do n't care why I 'm doing it , " Sophie said . " The point is that I can see it starving . " " What time are we due at the Holsteins ? " " Nine-ish , " she said , on her way to the door with a saucer ofp6milk . She reached up and inserted a small key in the lock , which had been placed on a crosspiece above the frame . Then she turned the brass handle . At once the cat cried out , and began to lap up the milk . From other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mumbleof television sets and radios  --  but the sheer multiplicity of noises made it difficult to identify individual ones . The cat 's huge head hung over the little Meissen saucer . Sophiestooped and drew her hand along its back , which quivered beneath her fingers . " Come back in and shut the door ! " Otto complained . " It 's gettingcold in here . " A dog 's anguished yelp broke suddenly through the surface of the evening hum . " My God ! " exclaimed Otto . " What are they doing to that ani-mal ! " " Catholics believe that animals have no souls , " Sophie said . " Those people are n't Catholics . What are you talking about ! They all go to that Pentecostal iglesia up the street . " The cat had begun to clean its whiskers . Sophie caressed its back again , drawing her fingers along until they met the sharp furry crook where the tail turned up . The cat 's back rose convulsivelyto press against her hand . She smiled , wondering how often , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touch , and she was still smiling as the cat reared up on its hind legs , even as it struck at her with extended claws , smiling right up to that second when it sank its teeth into the back of her left hand and hung from her flesh so that she nearly fell forward , stunned and horrified , yet conscious enough of Otto 's presence to smother the cry that arose in her throat as she jerked her hand back from that circle of barbed wire . She pushed out with her other hand , and as the sweat broke out on her forehead , as her flesh crawled and tightened , she said , " No , no , stop that ! " to the cat , as though it had done nothing more than beg for food , andp7in the midst of her pain and dismay she was astonished to hear how cool her voice was . Then , all at once , the claws released her and flew back as though to deliver another blow , but then the . it turned  --  it seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shadowed yard below . " Sophie ? What happened ? " " Nothing , " she said . " I 'm going to get the tea now . " She pushed the door closed and walked quickly to the kitchen , keepingher back turned to Otto . Her heart pounded . She tried to breathe deeply to subdue that noisy thud and she wondered fleetingly at the shame she felt  --  as though she 'd been caught in some despicable act . Standing at the kitchen sink , clenching her hands , she told herself it was nothing . A long scratch at the base of her thumb bled slowly , but blood gushed from the bite . She turned on the water . Her hands looked drained ; the small frecklelike blotches which had begun to appear during the winter were livid . She leaned forward against the sink , wondering if she were going to faint . Then she washed her hands with yellow kitchen soap . She lip lead her skin , tasting soap and blood , then covered the bite with a scrap of paper toweling . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through some legal papers bound in blue covers . He glanced up at her , slid she looked back at him with apparent calm , then placed his tea in front of him with her right hand , keeping the other out of sight at her side . Still , he seemed faintly puzzled , as though he 'd heard a sound he could n't identify . She forestalled any questions by asking him at once if he'a like some fruit . He said no , and the moment passed . " You left the door open . You have to lock it , Sophie , or it just swings back . " She closed the door again , securing it with the key . Through the glass , she saw the saucer . Already there were a few spots of it in it . She 'd given up cigarettes in the fall , but it did n't seemp8much use . I ca n't unlock the door again , she said to herself . " It 's done , " Otto said . He sighed . " Done , at last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sophie . You really do n't listen to me any more . Charlie moved out today , to his new office . He did n't even tell me until this morning that he 'd actually found a place . He said he wanted the whole thing to be a clean break . If I need the files , can I get in touch with you ? ' That 's what he asked me . Even in such a question , he implies that I 'm likely to be unreasonable . " She sat down , keeping her left hand on her lap . " You 've never said much about any of it to me , " she said . " There was n't much to say . In this last year we have n't agreed on anything , not anything . If I said it was going to rain , Charlie would pull at his lower lip and say , no , it was n't going to rain . After reading the weather reports carefully , he judged it was going to be a fine clear day . I should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change . I made all the superficial adjustmentsI could . " " You 've been together such a long time . Why have you come to this now ? " " I do n't care for the new people he 's taken up with , the clients . I know what 's always gone on in the office . I 've done the tiresome work while Charlie 's put on his funny hats and knocked everybody dead with personal charm . His whole act has consisted in denying the law is anything but an ironic joke , and that goes far with a lot of people . " " It will be hard to see them . Do n't you think it will ? Ruth and I 've never been close friends , but we managed . How do you just stop seeing people ? What about the boat ? " " You just stop , that 's how . The winter has been so bad . You ca n't imagine the people in the waiting room , a beggar 's army . He told me today that some of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they 'll be more comfortable inp9his new place . Then he said I 'd dry up and disappear if I did n't , in his words , tune in on the world . God ! You should hear him talk , as though he 'd been sanctified ! One of his clients accused the receptionist of being racist because she asked him to use an ashtray instead of grinding his cigarette butt out in the rug . And today , two men like comic-strip spies helped him pack his goddamn cartons . No , we wo n't be seeing them and he can have the boat . I 've never cared that much about it . Really , it 's just been a burden . " Sophie winced as she felt a thrust of sharp pain . He frowned at her and she saw that he thought she had n't liked what he had said . She 'd tell him now , might as well . The incident with the cat was silly . At a distance of half an hour , she wondered at the terror she 'd felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she said . He got up at once and walked around the table to her . " Let me see . " 11 She held up her hand . It was hurting . He touched it delicately , and his face showed solicitude . It flashed through her mind that he was sympathetic because the cat had justified his Warning against it . " Did you wash it ? Did you put something on it ? " " Yes , yes , " she answered impatiently , watching the blood seep through the paper , thinking to herself that if the bleeding would stop , that would be an end to it . " Well , I 'm sorry , darling . But it was n't a good idea to feed it . " " No . It was n't . " " Does it hurt ? " " A little . Like an insect bite . " " Just take it easy for a while . Read the paper . " He cleared the table , put the dishes in the dishwasher , scraped the remaining livers into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he went about his work , he caught glimpses of Sophie , sittingp10up very straight , the newspaper on her lap . He was curiously touched by her uncharacteristic immobility . She appeared to be listening for something , waiting . Sophie sat in the living room and stared at the front page of the newspaper . Her hand had begun to throb . It was only her hand , she told herself , yet the rest of her body seemed involved in a way she could n't understand . It was as though she 'd been vitally wounded . Otto walked into the living room . " What are you going to wear ? " he asked her cheerfully . " That Pucci dress , " she said , " although I think I 've put on too much weight for it . " She got up . " Otto , why did it bite me ? I was petting it . " " I thought you said it just scratched you . " " Whatever it did . . . but why did it attack me so ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the soft buttery light of a Victorian bubble-glass globe which hung from the ceiling . She and Otto had worked for a week taking off the old black paint from the banister . It was the first thing they had done together after they had bought the house . " Because it 's savage , " he said . " Because all it wanted from you was food . " He put his foot on the first step and said , as if to himself , " I 'll be better off by myself . " " You 've always had your own clients , " she said irritably , clenching and unclenching her hurt hand . " I do n't see why you could n't keep on together . " " All that melodrama . . . I ca n't live with that . And he could n't leave it alone . If I was n't with him , I was against him . I do n't mean to say there is n't cause . I do n't mean to say there 's any kind of justice in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those people and their causes . He just does n't want to be left out . And I want to be left out . Oh . . . it was time it all ended . We 've used each other up . The truth is , I do n't like him any more . "  |p11I  wonder how he feels ? " " Like Paul Muni , defending the unlovely and unloved . There never were such lawyers . Do you remember ? All those movies in the thirties ? The young doctors and lawyers going to the sticks and edifying all the rubes ? " " Paul Muni ! Charlie 's right , " she said . " You 're barely in the right century . " ' nhat 's true . " " But Charlie is not bad ! " she exclaimed . " I did n't say he was bad . He 's irresponsible and vain and hystericalBad has n't anything to do with it . " " Irresponsible ! What do you mean , irresponsible ! " " Shut up ! " said Otto . He put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said . " I 'll get blood on you ! "  |p12A  few feet from the bottom step , Otto paused and turned , as hehabitually did , to look back at his home . He was drawn toward it . He yearned to throw open the door he had only just locked , to catch the house empty . It was , he thought , a little like the wish to be sentient at one 's own funeral . With one or two exceptions , each of the houses on the Bentwoods ' block was occupied by one family . All of the houses had been built during the final third of the last century , and were of brick or brownstone . Where the brick had been cleaned , a chalky pink glow gave off an air of antique serenity . Most front parlor windows were covered with white shutters . Where ownershad not yet been able to afford them , pieces of fabric concealedthe life within behind the new panes of glass . These bits of cloth , even though they were temporary measures , had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were not at all like the rags that hung over the windows of the slum people . What the owners of the street lusted after was recognition of their superior comprehension of what counted in this world , and their strategy for getting it combined restraint and indirection . One boardinghouse remained in business , but the nine tenants were very quiet , almost furtive , like the last remaining members of a foreign enclave who , daily , expect deportation . The neighborhood eyesore was a house covered with yellow tile . An Italian family that had lived on the block during its worst days , finally moving out the day after all the street lamps had been smashed , was held responsible for this breach of taste . The maple trees planted by the neighborhood association thep13yea ; before were beginning to bud . But the street was not well Sighted yet , and despite phone calls , letters , and petitions to City lull and the local precinct , policemen were rarely glimpsed , exterin patrol cars on their way to the slum people . At night , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it were continuing to try to improve itself in the dark . There was still refuse everywhere , a tide that rose but barely ebbed . Beer bottles and beer cans , liquor bottles , candy wrappers , crushed cigarette packs , caved-in boxes that had held detergents , rags , newspapers , curlers , string , plastic bottles , a shoe here and there , dog feces . Otto had once said , staring disgustedly at the curb in front of their house , that no dog had depositedat . " Do you suppose they come here to shit at night ? " he had asked Sophie . She had n't replied , only giving him a sidelong glance that was touched with amusement . What would he have said , she wondered , if she had told him that his question had reminded her of a certain period in her childhood when moving the bowels , as her mother called it , was taken up by Sophie and her friends as an outdoor activity , until they were all caught in a community squat beneath a lilac bush ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in order , her mother had said , to study the proper receptacle for such functions . The Holsteins lived in Brooklyn Heights on Henry Street , ten blocks from the Bentwoods . Otto did n't want to take the car and lose his parking space , and although Sophie did not feel up to walking she was vaguely nauseated  --  she did n't want to insist on being driven . Otto would think the cat bite had affected her more than it really had . It was usually more costly to make  --  tool of oneself , she thought . Her fatuity had deserved at least a small puncture . " Why do they drop everything on the pavement ? " Otto asked angrily  | " It 's the packaging . Wrapping frenzy . " " It 's simple provocation . I watched a colored man kick over a trash basket yesterday . When it rolled out into the street , he put his hands on his hips and roared with laughter . This morning I saw that man who hangs the blanket outside his window standing on his bed and pissing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gear passed ; a window slid down and a hand gently released a ball of Kleenex . Sophie began to laugh . " Americans . . . " muttered Otto , " softly dropping their turds wherever they go . " They crossed Atlantic Avenue and started west , passing the Arab shops with their windows full of leather cushions and hookahs , the Arab bakeries which smelled of sesame paste . A thin Eastern wail slid out of a store no bigger than a closet . Inside , three men were staring down at a hand-operated record player . Sophie paused in front of a Jordanian restaurant , where the Bentwoods had dined with Charlie Russel and his wife only last week . Looking past the flaking gold letters on the glass , she saw the table they had sat at . " How is it possible ? It all seemed so friendly that night , " she said softly . " It was . When we first decided to end the partnership , it was friendlier than it ever had been . But this week . . . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  but it all seemed so set . " " No , we did n't agree . " She exclaimed suddenly and held up her hand . " What is it ? " he asked . " You brushed against it . " They stopped beneath a light while Otto inspected her hand . " It 's swollen , " he said . " Looks awful . " " It 's all right , just sensitive . " The bleeding had stopped , but a small lump had formed , pushing up the lips of the wound.  | " I think you ought to see a doctor . You ought , at least , to get  --  tetanus shot . " " What do you mean , at least ' ? " she cried irritably . " Do n't be so bad-tempered . " They turned up Henry Street . Otto noted with satisfaction that there was as much garbage here as in their own neighborhood. l le would n't consider buying a house on the Heights . , . horribly inflated prices , all that real-estate grinning in dusty crumbling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! - everyone knowing it was a put-up job , greed , low belly greed , get it while we can , house prices enunciated in refined accents , mortgages like progressive diseases , " I live on the Heights . " Of course , the Bentwoods ' neighborhood was on the same ladder , frantic lest the speculators now eying property were the " wrong " kind . Otto hated realtors , hated dealing with their nasty litigations . It was the only thing he and Charlie still agreed on . He sighed , thinking of the cop who had been check-ing on voter registration last week , who had said to Otto , " This area is really pulling itself together , does n't look like the same place it was two years ago . You people are doing a job ! " And Otto had felt a murderous gratification . " What are you sighing about ? " Sophie asked . " I do n't know . " The Bentwoods had a high income . They had no children and , since they were both just over forty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they did n't anticipate any . They could purchase pretty much what they wanted . They had a MercedesBenzsedan and a house on Long Island with a long-term mortgage , which was hardly a burden any more . It sat in a meadow near the village of Flynders . Like their Brooklyn house , it was small , but it was a century older . Otto had paid for repairs out of cash reserves . In the seven years they had owned it , there had been only one disagreeable summer . That was when three homosexual men had rented a neighboring barn and played Judyp16Garland records all night long every night . They had set their portable record player on a cement birdbath in the old cow pasture . In moonlight or in fog , Judy Garland 's voice rang out across the meadow , driving into Otto 's head like a mailed fist . That September , he bought the barn . Someday he planned to convert it into a guest house . At present it housed the sailboat he shared with Russel . " I think I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they walked up the steps to the Holsteins ' door . " I do n't even remember how much money we each put in . " " Where 's he going to sail it ? " Sophie asked . " In the Bowery ? " The goddamn bite had made her nervous , he thought , and when she was nervous the quality he valued in her most  --  her equableness  --  disappeared . She seemed almost to narrow physically . He pressed the bell beneath the severe black plate on which was printed MYRON HOLSTEIN , M.D. Even if he was a psychoanalyst , he ought to know something about animal bites , Otto told her , but Sophie said she did n't want to make an issue of it . It already felt better . " Please do n't bring it up . Just that I would like to leave early  --  " Then the door opened . There were so many people wandering around beneath Flo Holstein 's brilliant wall lights that it looked as if a sale were in progress . Even at a glance , Sophie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . These few were looking covertly at furniture and paintings . There was n't a copy of anything on the premises . It was real Mies van der Rohe , real Queen Anne , real Matisse and Gottlieb . Flo had produced two successful musicals . Mike Holstein 's practice was largely made up of writers and painters . Sophie liked him . Otto said he suffered from culture desperation . " He ca n't stand his own trade , " Otto had said . " He 's like one of those movie starlets who announces she 's studying philosophy at U.C.L.A. " But at that moment Sophie  --  her face held in Dr. Holstein'sp17Strong square hands  --  felt the nervous tension of the last two hours draining out of her as though she 'd been given a mild soporific . ' Soph , darling ! Hello , Otto . Sophie , you look marvelous ! Is that dress a Pucci ? What a relief that you do n't fiddle with your hair . That style makes you look like some sad lovely girl out of the thirties . Did you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of other people 's husbands , on the cheek , dry-lipped and ritualis-tic . He did n't know a thing about her , not even after ten years , but she loved the air of knowingness ; the flattery that did n't obligateher . And she liked his somewhat battered face , the close -- fitting English suits he bought from a London salesman who stopped at a mid-town hotel each year to take orders , the Italian shoes he said were part of his seducer 's costume . He was n't a seducer . He was remote . He was like a man preceded into a room acrobats . Despite her resolve to say nothing , she found herself whisperinginto his neck . " Something awful happened . . . I 'm making toomuch of it , I know , but it was awful ....

In the kitchen , Flo kissed her hurriedly and turned to look at a huge orange casserole squatting inside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them turning the water tap off and on and staring pensively in the sink , did not look up . " What happened ? Do you want your gin on the rocks ? " Mike asked . " A cat bit me . " " Let 's see . " She held up her hand . The slack fingers looked somewhat pitiful , she thought . Since she and Otto had looked at it under the lamp , the bump appeared to have grown larger . It was tingedI with yellow.  | " Listen , that ought to be looked at ! " " Oh , it 's nothing . I 've been bitten before by animals . " But she had n't . " It was a shock , " she said , stammering slightly as if she 'd tripped over her lie , " because I 'd been feeding the damned beast and it turned on me . " " I do n't think there 's been any rabies around here in years , but  --  " " No , " she said . " No , not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . I want to be the saint who tames wild creatures . " " Mike ! " Flo cried . " Get the door , will you ? Here , what are you drinking , Sophie ? " " Nothing right now , " Sophie answered . Mike left her with a pat on the back , a nod that said he 'd return . One of the young men began to comb his hair . Sophie went into the long living room . A television comedian she had met before at the Holsteins ' was holding forth among a group of seated people , none of whom was paying him much attention . In a voice of maniacalself-confidence , he reported that since he 'd grown his beard , he could n't eat cooked cereal any more without making a swine of himself .

She turned and saw a couple in their early twenties . The girl was in a white leather suit ; the boy wore an army fatigue jacket , on which were pinned buttons shaped and painted like eyeballs , staring from nothing , at nothing . His frizzy hair shot off in all directions like a pubic St. Catherine 's wheel . The girl was beautiful  --  youngand unmarked . Her amber hair fell to her waist . She wore a heavy bracelet around one of her ankles . " I saw at least three Jews , " Sophie said.  |p19They  did n't smile . " Your parties are educational , " the girl said . It is n't my party , " Sophie replied . " Yes , it 's yours , " the boy said judiciously . " Your generation 's thing . " " Oh , for crissakes ! " Sophie said , smiling . They looked at each other .

" We 've got to go see Lonnie up in St. Luke 's . " " The hospital ? " asked Sophie . " It 's too late for visiting hours . " ' They looked at her as though they 'd never seen her before , then they both padded softly out of the living room , looking neithe-r left nor right . " That 's a beautiful anklet ! " Sophie called out . The girl looked back from the hall . For an instant , she seemed about to smile . " It hurts me to wear it , " she shouted . " Every time I move , it hurts . " Otto was backed up against a wall , looking up at the chin of apowerfully built @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ playwright , a friend of Flo 's , who wrote exclusively in verse . Otto , Sophie observed as she walked over to them , had one hand behind him pressed against the wooden paneling . " We are all of us dying of boredom , " the woman was saying . That is the why of the war , the why of the assassinations , the why of why . Boredom . " " The younger ones are dying of freedom , " Otto said in a voice flattened by restraint . Sophie caught his eye . He shook his head very slightly . ' The young will save us , " the woman said . " It 's the young , thank the dead God , who will save us. "  | " They are dying from what they are trying to cure themselves with , " Otto said . " You are a square ! " the woman said , stooping a little to look into his face . " Hello , Suzanne , " Sophie said . " I just heard someone say , I 'm crashing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had a fake ingenuouslook on her face . It was obscurely insulting and she hoped Suzanne would feel the edge . " In contemporary parlance , " Suzanne explained magnanimously , " it means either that you 've come to spend the night in someone 's pad , or that you are coming down from a drug high . " She bowed to Otto and moved away . She rarely spoke to men when other women were around . " Jesus ! " Otto exclaimed . " Trying to stop her from talking is like trying to get a newspaper under a dog before it pukes ! " " I hate it when you talk like that ! You 're getting worse as you get older . I ca n't bear that mean reductive  --  " " Where 's your drink ? " " I do n't want a drink , " she said irritably . He stood directly in front of her , blocking out the room .

" That button 's loose , " she said , touching his jacket . " I 'll get you something . . . " he said , but he did n't move away . They had averted what was ordinary ; they had felt briefly the force of something original , unknown , between them . Even as she tried to name it , it was dissolving , and he left her suddenly just as she had forgotten what she was trying to remember . She flattened her hand against the wall paneling . It looked like a tarantula . Her skin prickled . Rabies . . . no one ever got rabies , except some Southern countryboy . " Sophie , come here , " Mike said , and led her upstairs and into a large bedroom . A Greek rug covered the bed ; a Mexican ce/ramic horse stood in front of the fireplace . On one of the bedsidetables were piled paperback detective stories in their penny candy wrapper covers . " Who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he replied , and he sighed and looked winsome . " They 're good for me . They ride roughshod over what I live with . Potent men . Palpitating women . . . a murderer 's mind laid out like the contents of a child 's pencil box .

" Everything is going to hell  --  " " Sit down a minute and shut up ! I want to call a doctor or two , see if I can rouse one . It 's a bad night for that . " He sat on the edge of the bed and dialed , an address book held tightly in one hand , the phone cradled between his neck and shoulder . She heard him speak several times , but she did n't listen to his words . She was wandering around the room . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On the mantelpiece stood a few small pre-Columbian statues , glaringwith empty malevolence at the opposite wall , looking , oddly enough , as though they were outside the room but about to enter and sack it .

It 's six blocks from here and they have an emergency room that 's not bad . They 'll fix you up and you 'll have a peaceful night . " " Did you know ? " she began , " that Cervantes wanted to come to the New World , to New Spain , and the king wrote across his application , No , tell him to get a job around here ' ? Is n't that a funny story ?

" " What 's the matter ? " " I wish I were Jewish , " she said . " Then when I died , I 'd die as a Jew . " " You 'll die as a Protestant . " " There are n't many left . " " Then as a Gentile . I asked you , what 's the matter ? Are you working on anything ? " " I have n't wanted to work ; it seems futile . There are so many who do it better than I do . I was sent a novel to translate but I could n't understand it , even in French . It simply irritated me . And I do n't have to work . " " Tell me a little Baudelaire , " he said. " le suis comme le roi d'un pays pluvieux , Riche , mais impuissant , jeune et pourtant t  --  vieux  --  " She broke off , laughing . " Why , you love it ! You should see your face ! Wait ! Here !

I liked the way you looked . That I could just recite a few lines and evoke that look ! " " Helpless bliss , " he said , getting to his feet . " You know that Charlie and Otto are ending their partner-ship ? " " Otto does n't confide in me . " " They ca n't get along any more , " she said , replacing the mirrorand turning back to him . " It 'll change our life , and yet it is as though nothing has happened . " " It wo n't change your life , " he said with a touch of impa/tience . " Maybe your plans , but not your life . Charlie , as I remember him , which is vaguely , is a bleeding heart , dying to be loved . He has the face of a handsome baby , does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patients ? And Otto is all restraint . So the machinestopped functioning . " He shrugged . " The truth is  --  " she began , then paused . He waited . " It was n't a machine , " she said quickly . " That 's an appalling view of what happens between people . " " What did you start to say ? " " But are you saying what went on between them was only a mechanical arrangement of opposites , Mike ? " " All right , then , it was n't . The words do n't matter anyhow . Otto did n't seem distressed . " " We 'd better go down , " she said . But he had left her and was standing near the window , staring at the floor . As he lifted his head , she saw what he had been looking at . She walked over to him . They both looked at the stone on the floor . There were a few shards of broken glass around it . Mike picked it up . It filled the palm of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said . They both looked down at the street ; the broken pane where the stone had entered was at the height of Mike 's brow . " It must have been in the last hour , " he said . " I was up an hour ago , getting aspirin for someone , and I stopped by here , I 've forgotten why , and I know the stone was n't here then . " Someone walked by on the street below , a St. Bernard puppy shambling along beside him . In all the windows of the opposite houses , lights shone . Car hoods glinted . Mike and Sophie silentlywatched a man investigating the contents of his glove compartment . A news truck rumbled by . " Do n't mention it to Flo . I 'll clean it up . Who could have done it ? What am I supposed to do ? " Then he shook his head . " Oh , well , it 's nothing . " He smiled at her and patted her arm . " Sophie , would you like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ap24friend I think highly of ? A first-rate man ? Member of the Institute ? " He hefted the stone , looked back out the window . " Thanks , Mike , but no . " " But at least go to the hospital , " he said , without looking at her at all . She stared at him a moment , then left the room . Otto was waiting for her at the bottom of the stairs , a glass in his hand . He held it out as she neared the bottom . " Ginger ale , " he said.  | " I 'm tired of parties , " Otto said in the taxi . " I get so bored . Movie talk bores me . I do n't care about Fred Astaire , and he does n't care about me . I care even less about Fellini . Flo is selfimportantsimply because she knows actors . " " Why did you say you had n't seen Death Takes a Holiday ? I know you saw it because we saw it together .

" " And Fredric March , you said , was a perfect expression of an American idea of death , a dissipated toff in a black cape . " " You stored all that away ? " he asked wonderingly . " You fell asleep and everyone knew you were asleep . Mike poked me and told me to take you home . " " They were all trying to out-memory each other . It just proved how old we all are . " " You have to make an effort . " " What were you doing upstairs with Mike ? " " He called some doctors about the cat bite . " " He thinks you ought to see someone ? " he asked , alarmed . She held up her hand . " Look how swollen it is ! " she said . She flexed her fingers and groaned . " Perhaps if I soak it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctor say ? " " Nobody was in . Do n't you know you ca n't get a doctor any more ? Do n't you know this country is falling apart ? "  | " Just because you ca n't get a doctor on Friday evening does not mean the country is falling apart . " " Oh , yes it does . There was a stone in their bedroom . Someonehad thrown a stone through the window . It must have happenedjust before we arrived . Picked up a stone from somewhere and tossed it through the window ! " As she was speaking , she took hold of his arm and now , as she became silent , her grip tightened as though only her hand could continue the burden of her thoughts . " That 's awful , " he said . The taxi was idling . Otto saw they were home . He paid the driver . Sophie , suddenly animated by a murky but powerful conviction that she knew what was wrong with everything , ran up the steps . But she had to wait for Otto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the steps slowly , looking at the change in his hand . Sophie 's access of energy , so startling as to verge on pain , died at once . As they walked into the dark hall , the telephone rang . " Who . . . ? " he began . " At this time of night , " she said , as Otto went to the phone . But he did n't touch it . It rang three more times , then Sophie pushed past him and grabbed the receiver . Otto went into the kitchen and opened the refrigerator . " Yes ? " he heard her say . " Hello , hello , hello ? " No one answered , but there was a faint throb as though darknesshad a voice which thumped along the wire . Then she heard an exhalation of breath . " It 's some degenerate , " she said loudly . Otto , a piece of cheese in one hand , gestured to her with the other . " Hang up ! For God 's sake , hang up ! " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " An American cretin . " Otto stuffed the cheese in his mouth , then snatched the phone from her hand and replaced it with a bang in its cradle . " I do n't know what 's the matter with you ! " he cried . " You could ask , " she said , and began to cry . " I 've been poisonedby that cat . " They turned to look at the back door.  | " My God ! It 's back ! " she exclaimed . A gray shape was huddled against the bottom of the door , towardwhich Otto ran , waving his hands and shouting , " Get outl " The cat slowly raised its head and blinked . Sophie shuddered . " I 'll call the A.S.P.C.A. tomorrow , " Otto said . The cat got up and stretched . They saw its mouth open as it looked up at them hopefully . " We ca n't have this , " Otto muttered . He looked reproachfully at her . " If I do n't feed it , it 'll give up , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to . . . " He turned off the living room lamp . " Why did n't you answer the phone ? " she flung back at him as they went up the stairs . " You 're becoming an eccentric , like Tanya . " " Tanya ! I thought Tanya lived her whole life on the phone . " " She wo n't answer it any more unless she 's just broken off a love affair . " " Love affair , " he snorted , following Sophie down the hall to their bedroom . " Tanya and love ! " " She calls up people , though . " " I hate Tanya . " They stood facing each other beside the bed . " You 've never told me that , " she said . " I 've never heard you say that you hated anyone . " " I only just realized it . " " What about Claire ? " " Claire is all right . What do you care what I think about Tanya ? You do n't like her yourself . You hardly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyone . " " Why do you make me feel it 's my fault ? " " You have n't explained about not answering the phone , " she said accusingly . " Because I never hear anything on it that I want to hear any more . " They were both standing rigidly , each half-consciously amass/ing evidence against the other , charges that would counterbalancethe exasperation that neither could fathom . Then he asked her directly why she was angry . She said she was n't angry at all ; it was just so tiresome of him to indulge himself about the telephone , to stand there so stupidly while it rang , to force her to do it . " Let 's go to bed , " he said wearily . She gave him an ironic look , which he ignored . She was really wondering what would happen if she told him the telephone call , that sinister breathing , had frightened her . He would have said , " Do n't be foolish ! " she concluded . " Stop telling me I 'm foolish , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his suit . She watched him straighten the pants . " You ought to throw out the underwear you 're wearing , " she said . " It 's about to fall apart . " " I like it when they get so soft , after I 've had them a long time . " He sounded rather plaintive . She felt kinder toward him . There was something funny about people 's private little preferencesand indulgences , something secretive and childlike and silly . She laughed at him and his soft old underwear . He looked down at himself , then at her , as he stripped off the shorts . His expression was complacent . Let him be complacent , she thought . At least , they 'd avoided a pointless quarrel . She wondered if Tanya had ever tried to seduce Otto . Then she remembered Tanya 's only visit to Flynders . Otto had been shocked , morally outraged really , when he had accidentally discovered that Tanya had used every drawer in an immense bureau for the few articlesshe 'd brought with her that weekend . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawer , a pair of stockings in another , one girdle in another . What kind of a woman is it who would use all the drawers in a chest just because they 're there ? " he had cried to Sophie . " Tanya is pretty awful , " Sophie said as Otto got into bed nextp29to her . " I bet she 's awful to make love to . I bet she can hardly take her eyes off herself long enough to see who she 's in bed with . " " Go to sleep , " he pleaded . " You 're going to wake me up . " She subsided without complaint . She was n't irritated with him now , and it did n't seem to matter why she had been . She examined her hand and decided to give it a soaking . It certainly hurt . When Sophie awoke , it was 3:00 A.M. Her hand , doubled up beneath her , was like an alien object which had somehow attacheditself to her body , something that had clamped itself to her . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , how surprisedshe 'd been , seeing it again , when she and Otto had come home . It had looked so ordinary , just another city stray . What had she expected ? That it would have been deranged by its attackon her ? That it planned to smash and cuff its way into their house and eat them both up ? She got up and went into the bathroom . The swelling , which she had managed to reduce earlierby the long soak in hot water , had returned . She filled the basin and immersed her hand . Then , looking at her face in the mirror over the sink  --  she did n't want to see what she was doing  --  she began to press the fingers of her other hand against the swollen mass of skin . When she looked down , the water was clouded . She flexed her fingers , then made a fist . When she got back into bed , she half threw herself against Otto 's back . He groaned . " My hand is worse , " she whispered . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Noel first thing in the morning , " he said . " If wehave to , we 'll drive up to Pelham and drag him to his office . You 've got to have that looked at . " " If it is n't any better . " " Anyway . " Otto fell back against the pillows . " What time is it ? " There were times when he felt he had not had a full night'sp30sleep since he had been married . Sophie seemed to take a special pleasure in night conversations . " Three . Did you notice how young Mike behaved ? How he looked ? Did you see that Hungarian ribbon around his forehead , or folk art ribbon , or whatever it was ? " " Do n't talk about it , " he said sharply . " Just do n't bring it up . It only makes me angry . Wait till he tries to get a job . " " He 'll never get a job . Mike will fund him . And the hair . He was playing with it all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , braiding it , stroking it , pulling it . " " What did you talk to him about ? " " Stupid things , stupidly . " " They are n't all that bad , " Otto said . " Water babies . They come out of faucets , not out of people . " " They want to be Negroes , " Otto said , yawning . " I wish I knew what they 're up to , " she said , suddenly rememberingshe had told Mike 's father that she wanted to be a Jew . " They 've chosen to remain children , " he said sleepily , " not knowing that nobody has that option . " What was a child ? And how would she know ? Where was the child she had been ? Who could tell her what she had been like ? She had one photograph of herself at four , sitting in a wicker rocker , a child 's chair , her legs straight out , in white cottonpanties , wearing someone 's Panama hat that was too big for her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , wicker chair , white cotton panties ? Who had taken that picture ? It was already turning yellow . What did young Mike , dirty , mysterious , seemingly indifferent , speaking that hieratic lingo that both insulted and exiled her , have to do with her childhood ? With any childhood ? " Otto ? " But he was asleep . A car went by . A slight breeze came through the open window , carrying with it the sound of a dog 's bark . Then she heard knocking , a fist on wood . She wentp31to the window and looked down at the ledge which hid from view the stoop and anyone who might be standing there . There was a kind of grunt , then several sharp raps , then a whisper . Had her scalp really moved ? She looked back at the bed . Then she went to the hall and down the stairs , her hand held stiffly against the soft folds of her nightgown . Stopping at the front door , hidden by the curtains which coveredthe glass insets , she listened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a large body swayed , a large head veered toward the door , then away . " Otto . . . " sighed a voice sadly . Sophie unlocked the door . Charlie Russel was standing there , one lapel turned up . " Charlie ! " " Ssh ! " He stepped into the entryway and she closed the door . Then they were close to each other like two people about to embrace . She felt his whole face watching her like an enormous eye . " I 've got to talk to Otto , " he whispered intensely . " He 's asleep . " " I 'm in a terrible state . I have to see him . " " Now ? You 're crazy . " " Because I could n't see him a second before now . Because it 's taken me all this time , from this morning when I last set eyes on him , to get to the point where I am . I do n't care what time it is . " He reached out and gripped her arms . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ angrily . " I will . " " You 're going to hurt my hand . A cat bit me . " " I feel murdered , " Charlie said , letting go of her all at once and leaning against the wall . " Listen . Let 's go out and get a cup of coffee . Now that I think about it , I do n't want to see that bas-tard . " " Does Ruth know where you are ? "  | " Ruth who ? " " That 's some joke , " she said . " I do n't like wife jokes . Theydrive me up the wall . Do n't make wife jokes to me . " He stooped and peered into her face . " You sound mad . " " I am mad , " she said . " Will you ? Have a cup of coffee ? " " Yes . " " Let 's make a getaway , " he said , clapping his hands together . " I 've got to get dressed . Do n't make any noise . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Do n't move . " She dressed silently ; even the sleeves of her blouse , drawn up carefully over her arms , made no sound . It was as though she was only thinking about getting dressed . Otto lay diagonally across the bed , one knee protruding from beneath the blanket . She brushed her hair quickly and pinned it , reached for a purse on the bureau , then left it there , putting her house keys in her pocket . As she picked up her shoes from the closet and tiptoed from the room , she felt , for a vertiginous moment , an unlawful excitement.  |p33They  went down the street silently , quickly , like conspirators , speaking only when they had turned a corner and were headed for downtown Brooklyn . " Where are we going ? " he asked . " Is there anything open ? " " I do n't know . I 've never been around here at this hour . Did you come by subway ? " " No . I took a taxi . He dropped me at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I walked to your house . " " Did you tell Ruth you were coming ? " " No . I had gone out to a movie . A man who was sitting besideme told me I was talking to myself . I told him not to interrupt , then , and he told me I was fucking up his one night out . So I left and got a taxi and went to a Bickford 's , which was full of people talking to themselves . Christ ! Look at the paper all over the sidewalks . " " Please . Do n't talk to me about garbage . " They had come to an intersection . From the west , bearing down on them with an echoing bang and rattle of mechanical parts , came a bus . It went through the red light . The driver was hunched forward , his arms encircling the wheel , his hands hanging down like paper hands . There was only one passenger , an old woman with dazzling white hair . She looked at once majestic and mindless . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Nothing . She 's asleep . " The light changed and changed again . Discarded wrappings and newspapers rustled all around them . A block away , a few figures stood torpidly outside the windows of a lunch counter.  |p34As  they walked toward it , Sophie could see two men inside , moving briskly as they rinsed out thick white cups and scrubbed a grill . The people outside were simply standing there , watching . Across the street , near a subway exit , a short fat dark man wearing a tiny black hat was staring down at a sewer grating . He had the stunned immobility of a displaced person who had come as far as he could without further instructions . " It 's about to close , " Charlie said . Sophie 's first exhilaration was gone . She was worried . Her whole left arm ached . Her excitement at the contrast between her formerly placid partner's-wife friendship with Charlie  --  no questions , no answers  --  and their present circumstances , the thought of Otto asleep and unaware , which had given impetus to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now it was like the labored conversation among guests at a late hour after there is nothing more to say , nothing but ashes in the fireplace , dishes in the sink , a chill in the room , a return to ordinary estrangement . " Perhaps we 'd better give it up , " she said . " No ! There must be a hotel open somewhere . Come on .. . we 'll try the Heights . " " Your lapel is twisted , " she said , turning to look up at him , hoping perhaps to turn him back with a humble domestic observation . He did n't appear to have heard her . He looked apprehensive . Grabbing her arm , he muttered , " Come on , now ... " Charlie was a large man , big-boned and substantial , yet limber , as though there were a gyroscope at the center of his torso . She had always liked his walk , a sloping easy placement of one foot after the other , a handsome swing of a walk . He had a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she felt ( he was walking so close to her ) , he was shambling . And he smelled stale , like stale liquor and stale sweat . " After Bickford 's , I went to a bar , " he said . " And I got into an argument . " Sophie stumbled , and he let go of her arm atp35once , as though by stumbling she 'd forfeited her right to his support . They crossed Livingston and walked in the direction of Adams Street . " There was a man standing next to the stool I was sitting on , " he continued . " He had a tart on the stool in front of him , and he was rubbing up against her something fierce , telling her about a boat . She was smiling in a ladylike way but stiffening her back to give him a little more . He said he 'd just bought a seventeen-foot sloop and he was going to christen it nigger . ' He was going to paint the boat 's name in black Gothic letters and then he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it right there in the harbor , where all those rich coloreds go for the summer . On the other hand , he said he was considering calling the boat nigger pederast ' and sailing it in Great South Bay close to Fire Island . So I introduced myself to him and the lady  --  she was drinking rye and ginger ale through a straw  --  and said I had a better suggestion for his boat 's name . He told me to push off . I told him to call it American motherfucker . ' She thought that was a great little name and laughed so hard she fell on the bar , but he hauled off to kill me . I twisted his arm behind his fat back , and then I was asked to leave by the authorities . " They came to Adams Street . Far ahead , Sophie saw the arch of the bridge over the East River . All around them were official buildings , with the peculiarly threatening character of large carnivorousmammals momentarily asleep . " There 's Family Court , " Charlie said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't set a foot in there . Too low class . Half my clients spend most of their time in those urine-scented chambers , sitting on broken camp chairs , trying to get an extra seven bucks a week from some poor devil of a colored man for their ten children which he has abandoned because their support cuts into his drinking money , without which he would chop up his equally wretched neighbors with a cleaver . You just wait ! " " What do you mean ! "  | " Oh . . . not you . I did n't mean you , Sophie . I do n't know what I meant . " But she thought he did . He was dissembling  --  in his fashion . " You know , Otto and I were at Columbia together . We were even in the Army together . Most of my life , we 've been together . Do you know what he said to me this morning when I left ? He said , Lots of luck , fella ' ! And then he vomited out that hideous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I turned away and he pushed a button and his secretary came in for dictation . There I was , feeling the way I did when I was eight years old , my first day in camp , and I had made peepee in my pants because some little nature sadist wrapped a milk snake around my neck . " He paused and looked down at her . " Did you say a cat bit you ? " " We 'd better cross here . Yes . I did say it . " " I did n't know you had a cat . What is it ? One of those orientalgenetic freaks that cost $700 ? " " You sound like a corkscrew , " she said . " What 's that thing over there ? " " A new co-operative they 're putting up . " " Now , what about this cat ? " " It was a stray I was determined to feed . And it bit me , stood up on its hind legs and fell upon me . My skin crawls to think about it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " No . " " You are crazy , Sophie . When did you have a tetanus shot last ? " " Not so long ago . I got a barn splinter in my foot last summer and I had one then . " " That 's a minor matter . It 's the other thing ... " " Do n't talk to me about it . The cat was n't sick . " " Rabies can take up to five years to incubate. "  | " THE CAT WAS N'T SICK ! " she shouted . " Here ! " and she held her hand up . " It 's a bite , just a bite ! " " Otto should catch it and take it to a vet . They can tell , " he said in a conciliating way . " Now calm down . " " Pain frightens me more than dying , " Sophie said . " I wo n't even let them give me painkillers because I 'm afraid the pain will win out over them . Then there would be nothing except pain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then she laughed , too . A policeman left the darkened entrance of a post office and walked slowly toward them . Charlie put his arm around her and they crossed the wide street and turned up a lane . " Why do I feel like a crook ? " he muttered . " What 's the point of seeing Otto ? " she asked him suddenly . " There 's no point , is there ? " " I want him to acknowledge that something important has happened . Do you know that when people change slowly and irrevocablyand everything goes dead , the only way to cure them is a bomb through the window ? I ca n't live that way , as though things were just the same . " " You 're the one who left , " she said . " He does n't even know you feel this way . " " No , he does n't . That 's his moral failure . " His face was like a handsome baby 's , she thought , just as Mike Holstein had said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for one brief flash , out in the boat last summer on a buoyant , brilliantday , his blue eyes wide as he looked up the mast to the wind indicator , his hair bleached white by the summer sun , with his pouting mouth and heavy nose , she had thought of a Renaissance putto . " Look , there 's a place open , " she said . " What do you mean , moral failure ? He 's like most people . " " I 'm not concerned with most people . " " I thought that was your concern , most people . "  | " Do n't haggle with me , " he said , pushing open the door . He hurried her inside . " God , I 'm cold , " he said . Against the imitation brick wallpaper , a few dim lights cast an orange glow . Somewhere in the gloom , a radio played low , occasionally crackling with static . The bartender , one hand on the bar , the other on a shelf across the way , straddled his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ screen of a small television set , which was suspended from the ceiling . " Is n't that Alice Faye ? " asked Sophie . The bartender turned to look at her . He smiled . " Old Alice , " he said . They went to a booth but no one came to serve them . Charlie said that what he 'd really like was a three-minute egg with a bit of butter in it and a cup of strong black coffee . It 's a wish for morning , Sophie thought . He went to the bar and fetched them back two bottles of Danish beer . As he sat down , a man in the next booth cleared his throat violently . Then he said , " Honesty is my God . Frankly , I would n't have lied to Hitler . " There was a kind of female moan of assent . Sophie peered over the back of the booth and saw a woman , her head resting on one hand as though it had come loose from her neck . " How do you know what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do ? You and he have been fighting for years , have n't you ? Like smiling people in a swimming pool , kicking each other under water . " " Opinions do n't matter in the end , " he said dispiritedly . " Affectiondoes . . . loyalty . I 've always loved Otto . Today he behaved toward me as though I were the boy who comes to the office with the sandwiches and coffee . " He rubbed his eyes violently , then blinked at her . " He 's shut up in a box , " he said . " Squire Bentwood . . . had to bury his wife . . . dead , you know . " " I 'm his wife , " she said , " and not buried . "  | " When his oldest friend takes up with black sharecroppers and other undesirables , he refuses to look . And if his oldest friend leaves his precincts , he does n't give way to unseemly emotions . He does n't have unseemly emotions . " " You 're a coarse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words . She had n't thought anything ; she 'd just been listening , and suddenlyshe 'd said that . " Coarse , " she repeated . He had reared back ; his mouth hung open . It was her own protest against Otto she 'd been hearing , but why , on Charlie 's lips , did it have that special kind of untruth that hides itself so despicably in virtuous opinions and only indicates the self 's vanity ? And she wanted him to tell her Otto was cold , shut away ; her desire for that confirmationwas like an aroused and insatiable appetite . Yet , she 'd called him coarse . " You do n't know what 's going on , " he said at last . " You are out of the world , tangled in personal life . You wo n't survive this . . . what 's happening now . People like you . . . stubborn and stupid and drearily enslaved by introspection while the foundation of their privilege is being blasted out from under them . " He looked calm . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you were talking about , about personal life ? " " I was . But my meaning is entirely different from yours . " " But I did n't say anything about personal life , " she protested . " You do n't know what I think about anything . " Oh , but he did , she thought . She 'd gotten to him with that word . He was , she could see it in his face  --  he was trying to look severe  --  thinking about " coarse . " " Well , perhaps you 're just innocent , " she suggested . " Innocent ! " he exclaimed . She laughed at once and extravagantly . He looked relieved . " That 's the truth . I did n't know about Lancelot and Guinevere till I was twenty-three . " " That 's not what I meant , " she said . She clasped the cold bottle of beer in her left hand . Pain flared up . He saw her flinch.  | " I 'm going to take you to the hospital . There 's a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she said firmly . " Why not , Sophie ? It 's simple enough . " " I wo n't , " she said . " I wo n't go running off to a hospital for something as foolish as this . " " It 's foolish not to . You 're afraid of those shots , are n't you ? Why do n't you admit it to yourself ? " " When I said innocent before , I did n't mean sexually , " she said sharply . " There are other kinds of innocence . " " Ruth would n't agree with you , " he said . " She talks about nothing except the new liberation . ' She 's taken up Yoga and chopped off her hair . She wants to get hold of some hashish . I told her to wait and she 'll be able to buy it at Bloomingdale 's notions counter . She had a revelation last summer . . . she told me about it , how she was standing next to a man she did n't know on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the heat was beating down , the ocean in a blue heat haze . She looked at his back  --  his naked back , ' she says  --  and wanted to embrace him . She talks about sexual modalities , she talks about the wit ' of pornography . She 's going crazy , poor devil , and she 's driving me crazy . But listen . What 's strange is that we 've stopped makinglove . All winter , a cold winter . " Sophie felt a thrill of fear . She did n't want to hear about it , thinking of Ruth , her air of sexual plenty , how Ruth had always made her feel shy , vaguely oppressed . " I have n't spoken to her recently , " she said , embarrassed . " Oh , yes . I know that , " he said meaningfully . " I 'll call her . " " Do n't . She does n't know what 's going on . I do n't tell her much . She 's like a demented Sherlock Holmes tracking down the ultimate clue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morbid and so banal . I have n't got anyone to talk to . " " You 're talking to me. "  | " So I am . " The couple from the next booth passed them , the woman weeping softly . He was a fat white man . She was a Negro . Her eyes were half closed , her mouth drawn downward . Suddenly she widened her eyes and looked directly at Sophie . " I came here from Dayton to see can I live or not , " she said . " Shut up , " said the man conversationally . They went on , out the door . " You do n't mean the marriage is finished , do you ? " " No ! " he said angrily . " No . . . she 's not had anyone except me , and she 's afraid of age . She 's simply not herself now . But she 'll come back , the goddamn fool . " " The children ? " " Oh , they 're all right . Linda knows things are bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with adolescence to worry about anything else . She 's got a snotty way of saying yeah that drives me up the wall . Do you want another beer ? What are you thinking about ? It 's funny to be here , is n't it ? You and me ? Drinking beer and betraying our loved ones . " " I 'm not betraying anyone . " " We 've always been friends , have n't we ? " he asked , ignoring her denial . " There 's always been something between us , has n't there ? Do n't look so scared . Oh , God . . . Otto , Ruth , this country with its death rays and frozen peas . . . I 'm not so different from Otto . I want the past , too . I hate planes and cars and rocket ships . But I do n't dare . . . I do n't dare . Do n't you see ? This war ! Bobby is already sixteen . He can be drafted in a few years . Look at the mess ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a child , " she said . He did n't seem to have heard her . He slid out from beneath the table and went to the bar , returning with two more bottles of beer . " I had two miscarriages , " she said . " I know you did , " he said , sounding cranky . " I 've got a uterus like a pinball machine , apparently . "  | " Why did n't you ever adopt a child ? " " We put it off and put it off and now  --  we 're such a settled childless couple . " " It does n't matter , " he said . " They are hostages to fortune . I love them and they suffocate me . And it 's a business , like everything is these days , the having children business , the radicalbusiness , the culture business , the collapse of old values business , the militant business . . . every aberration becomes a style , a business . There 's even a failure business . " " Then there 's the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I wanted only to be like Mr. Jarndyce , really . That is the kind of lawyer I wanted to be , " Charlie said , rubbing his scalp furiously at a certain spot as though someone were hammering away from the inside . " You know . . . of Bleak House . There is that scene when Esther Summerson is weeping in the coach , and old Jarndyce whips out a plum cake and a pie from his cloak and offers her both of them , and when she refuses , my God , he simply flings them both out the window and says Floored again ! ' What style ! " He began to laugh , shouted , " And flung them out the window ! " and collapsed in the corner of the booth , choking a little and waving at the bartender , who was staring at them worriedly . " I think I 've got rabies , " she said . " Have a plum pie , " he replied , snickering " You 're the one who does n't care about anything , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ giggling ! " " I care about everything , " he said . " In my desperate fashion . It 's desperation that keeps me going . Let 's go wake up Otto . I want to tell him about Jarndyce . " And he began to laugh again . Then he wiped his face with the back of his hand and looked at her intently . " Are you desperate ? " he asked . " I do n't know . I suppose I need something to do . I 'm too idle . They sent me a novel to translate and I hated it . Then a fewp43days ago , someone called and wanted to talk about a Marseilles longshoreman who 's written some poems . I said I 'd think about it , but I did n't . Did you know my father was half-French ? And half-alcoholic . " " And your mother ? " " All Californian . She lives in San Francisco and consults astrologersfrom time to time . It 's her only aberration . " " No more family than that ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oakland , my mother 's relatives , but no one I 'd recognize on the street any more . After my father died , I lost interest , anyhow . Now I 'm at the brink , the extinguishing point . After me , my father stopped . It 's a sad thought . We just stop , our family ... " " No one in France either ? " " I do n't think so . Maybe . He never spoke of anyone . I do n't even know who his parents were , what his father did . My father was like an orphan . " She smiled at Charlie and then grew silent as she was struck with longing , an unprecedented longing to see her mother . My God . . . she was nearly seventy , pickled in sunshine by now , living that California life , she thought . It had been months since she 'd written , but it was so hard to write . Confronted with a sheet of writing paper , she could only fill it with banalities . Writing to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no life at all . But her mother was an old woman . Surely she ought to honor her age , if nothing else . " You liked your father ? " Charlie was asking . " I loved him . When I was about ten , I realized he was drunk most of the time . My mother constructed her social life around the idea that he had a slight speech impediment which made him shy . When he was falling down drunk in the living room , she just went away to Sausalito for a few days to visit one of her cronies . The real-estate business they had was in his name . But she ran it . He once told me that the only thing he had everp44wanted to do was to play the flute , to work for a good conductor , and sit in the orchestra pit with the other musicians . " " Why did n't he , then ? " " Oh , he was n't sentimental about it . He 'd been lazy with his life , he told me . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I suppose I thought he was talking about practicing . My mother is n't lazy . She 's a manifestation of some principle of mindless energy . She 's got a horrible little yard full of plants she 's yanked up out of the ground , and espaliered dwarf fruit trees , and she wrote me that she 's now taking up topiary . She probably still smokes too much and last time I spoke to her on the phone , her voice was still hearty , and last time I saw her she was freckled and sunburnt , and I suppose she 's still changing the furniture around the way she used to , knocking the hell out of it while my father watched from the door . " She smiled . " She was always in control of something , " she continued . " Except for one problem she never could manage . She had a good deal of trouble saying hello . I remember , when visitors came , how she 'd back into the room , puffing insanely on a cigarette , looking like a cornered rat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me about my father . Never . " " How did he die ? " " He shot himself with an Italian pistol he 'd bought in Rome just before he married her . " " Do you ever see her ? " " Not for the last ten years . I suppose I 'll have to one of these days . My father had small , beautiful feet and he was very proud of them . After he died , I found about ten pairs of his shoes gathering dust in a corner of a closet . I could see the print of his arch in the leather  --  it was very high . They were English shoes , and he had them made specially , like Mike Holstein has those Italian shoes made for himself . " " How is Mike ? I liked him , what little I saw of him . " " That 's where we went tonight , " she said . " Yesterday night . " She experienced a wave of weakness and she shook her headp45very slightly . He reached out a hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Tired , " she said . " It just came over me . What 's Ruth going to think if she wakes up and finds you gone ? " " She 'll assume I 'm with some pale young beautiful girl , where I ought to be at my age . " " Oh , no , she wo n't . That 's not what she 'd feel if she really thought that . " " She does n't really feel anything these days . " The bartender had tuned up the television set . " Try the brightener , " said a man at the bar . " No , try the verti-cal . " " I like the oldies , " the bartender said . " Imagine seeing Alice Faye after all these years . " " You want to go home , do n't you ? " Charlie leaned toward her . " Just another few minutes , all right ? " " Soon . I 'm worried now . If Otto wakes ... " " He 'll find it bracing , " Charlie said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't like to answer the telephone , even in the daytime . And we had a crank call when we got home from the Holsteins . " She looked searchingly at him , close to a conviction that it could have been only he who had called ; he 'd probably tried for hours and at last , when she 'd answered , he 'd gotten frightened . How odd if , so passionately intent on confronting Otto , he had become speechless just when there had been an answer . He was still leaning forward , but his neck and shoulders looked strained , as if he were forced to maintain a posture of intimacylong past the death of the original impulse . " Tell me a story , " he said . " I do n't want to go home yet . " " You wanted to see Otto , " she said . Was she telling him or asking him ? The booth was a small chilly room . A dank odor rose from the plastic seat cover . Somewhere within that confined space was the faint smell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sticking to her thighs . The bartender was fiddlingp46with the set . Only two other people sat at the bar , elderly men , neither drunk nor sober . Charlie continued to lean toward her ; she began to feel breathless , cornered . She visualized herself creeping up the stairs , taking off her clothes , placing her face between Otto 's shoulder blades , advancing into sweet domestic sleep as though into warm water . " It was n't you , was it , Charlie , who made that call ? " He sighed and sat back . He did n't answer her question . " I wanted to see Otto . I 'll have to see him . He ca n't get away with it . . . . Five minutes and we 'll go . All right ? Tell me more about yourself . " " Then I 'll tell you about my love affair . " " Yes , " he said , nodding . " I 'd like to hear about that . " He smiled generously . " A recent one ? " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said , and was instantly appalled by what she had done . He looked stricken . She had made a mistake . She had imagined their impulsive flight from the house , from Otto , had freed them from the restraints of caution and subterfuge , the habits of daytime life with their toneless and depthless familiarity . She had trusted the circumstance and overlookedthe participants . He watched her . She wanted to take back what she had said . " I 'm inventing for your entertainment , " she said . He reached across the table and took her hand . " That 's the hurt one ! " she cried and he released it at once . " Oh , why are you so horrified ! " she exclaimed . " I 'm not . It 's ordinary , " he said . " Only something I took for granted , and unimportant , after all . " " I said I invented it , " she said . He laughed . " All right . But I do n't believe you now . I saw the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : You were excited . " " Oh , God ! " she said , and put her hand over her eyes . " Well , there 's no story . Ordinary , as you said . " She dropped her hand and began to pull her coat over her shoulders.  | " At the time , Otto and I were thinking of separating . " " Were you ? " " Otherwise it would n't have happened . " " I do n't know about that , " he said matter of factly . " I want to go now . My hand hurts dreadfully . If you 'll take me to a cab . " " I 'll take you all the way home , " he said . They did n't speak in the taxi . But , often , he turned to her ; she felt his silent observation and she bore silently , as punishment , the violence of her desire to explain , to mitigate , to extenuate . As she inserted her key into the lock of the door , she heard Charlie calling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him leaning through the window . " I did make that phone call , " he said , " if it makes you feel any better . " Then he rolled up the window and the taxi went on down the street . Sophie stood motionless in the hall . The living room looked smudged , flat . Objects , their outlines beginning to harden in the growing light , had a shadowy , totemic menace . Chairs , tables , and lamps seemed to have only just assumed their accustomed positions . There was an echo in the air , a peculiar pulsation as of interrupted motion . Of course , it was the hour , the light , her fatigue . Only living things do harm . She sat down suddenly on a Shaker bench . Fourteen shots in the belly . Fourteen days . And even then , there was no guarantee ; you died from rabies , you choked to death . What pity could she expect ? Who would pity her in her childish terror , her evasion , her pretense that nothing much had happened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , edgeless and spongy , and now , here in all its surface banality and submerged horror was this idiot event  --  her own doing  --  this undignified confrontation with mortality . She thought of Otto , and ran up the stairs . In the bedroom , Otto lay sleeping , blankets and sheets twisted around his middle , his feet thrust beyond the edge of the bed.  |p48So|phie  soaked her hand . The hot water pained , then comforted . When she dried her hand , her fingers felt freer , as though the poison of the bite had withdrawn to concentrate on the wound itself . She belched softly , and with a habitual uneasiness at the thought of being overheard in such secret , unrestrained manifestationsof bodily being , she looked quickly through the open bathroom door , down the hall . She was bloated ; it must have been the beer . Her body was not her own any more , but had taken off in some direction of its own . In this last year she had discovered that its discomforts , once interpreted , always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She could not eat and drink the way she once had . Inexorably , she was being invaded by elements that were both gross and risible . She had only recently realized that one was old for a long time . She pulled her slip off and dropped it in the straw basket she used for her personal laundry . The unvarnished straw tore her stockings , but she would n't replace the basket , either out of inertiaor as a small defiance against practicality . She stripped off the rest of her clothes . A bottle of Guerlain perfume had turned to alcohol but still she patted some over her beery belly . Then she went down the hall and into the bedroom , where she found her nightgown on the floor where she had left it . Charlie would be almost home now , heading toward that populous , gloomy 1920 pile of stone in which he lived . All right , then , he had made the phone call . But why had he made it ? And then been silent ? Or had he lied ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a sin . Had that been Charlie breath/ing into the phone ? Only lunatics did such things . It was going to be a bad gray day ; the ashy light in the room was already irritating , like a note of music sustained too long . She looked down at Otto . Even in sleep he looked reasonable , although the immoderatelytwisted bedclothes suggested that reason  --  in sleep  --  had been attained at a cost . She would wake him , tell him he was well rid of Charlie , who was a man perpetually engaged in establishinghis superior capacity for human feeling . He did n't want Otto to grieve at the end of their partnership so much as he wanted him to admit that he , Charlie , was the right sort of human to be  --  loving bleeder that he was ! And now it appalled her to think she had given him that information about herself as carelessly as she might have handed a child a toy . What was even worse , what humiliated her further , was that she had seen her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Charlie saw himself . There was no way of getting under the blanket without wakingOtto . She took a heavy coat from the closet and lay down beneath it . Then she began to tell herself about Francis . She often told herself that story , easing herself into sleep , drifting off as she patched together the ghostly memory of someone in whose real existence she hardly believed any more.  |p50Sometimes  Otto 's interest in a client extended beyond the reasonthat had brought them together . Sophie did not know what particular qualities attracted him ; he was not inclined to analyze his own feelings or those of others . he was not inclined to wonder why he liked someone or to talk about what kind of people he thought they were . If Sophie suggested  --  her voice increasinglyexasperated  --  that so and so amused him because he was unpredictable or naive or an expert in an obscure field of inquiry ( the evolution of amusement parks ; black magic in New Orleans ) , Otto would nod and agree , all the while keeping his finger on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The client was invited to one small dinner party , and Otto would have an occasional lunch or drink with him ; that was all . A few lingered on , not close friends , but a little more than clients . Such a one was Francis Early , who had been referred to Otto by a publishing company he represented . Francis himself was a publisher of sorts . His purpose in coming to a lawyer remained ambiguous . If it had n't , Otto , who detested all divorce litigation , would probably have rejected his " case . " Francis ' efforts to resolve his matrimonial problems were not energetic . Mainly , he seemed to want to talk about them . Mrs. Early , with her three children , remained holed up in Locust Valley , Long Island , and refused to reply to any legal letters . When Francis phoned her to request she co-operate  --  at least in the formalitiesneeded for a legal separation  --  she complained she was having difficulties with the coal furnace ; he had n't given her the right instructions for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have oil heat installed , as he had promised to do severalp51years ago ? When Otto phoned her , she muttered , " You go to hell , too ! " and hung up . Francis had left her twice before . The first departure was the one that should have stuck , he told Otto , when there was only one child . Ultimately , Otto gave up any pretense that there was anything for him to do for either of them . Since Francis had a small apartment near Otto 's office , they had lunch together now and then . Francis maintained an office , once the second floor of an opulenttown house , on East Sixty-first Street , where , beneath a ceil-i ng of carved plaster that looked like soiled meringue , he publishedbooks on gardening , wild flowers , rose horticulture and treillage , along with a line of paperbacks on how to start a collection of butterflies or stamps , sea shells or antique cars , these latter , he said , the nearly exclusive source of the money which enabled him to publish the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Otto had gone to see the French National Theater 's production of Andromache . She had been aware of a special animation in herself attributed with some truth by Otto to the fact that he would have to wear earphonesfor the English translation while she could sit there in her bilingual authority . But the more generous truth was that she loved Racine , she loved Jean-Louis Barrault and the adamantineglitter of professionalism of French classical theater productions . She knew , too , that the evening would have a salutoryeffect on her , for a day or two at least , all that compressed intensity thrusting against her dreaminess ; her nebulous preoccupations , qualities which , when he was irritated by her , Otto called somnolence . Walking up three flights of stairs after a gaudy dinner at a French restaurant , they found Francis waiting for them in front of his door . He was smiling . He gave them cognac , setting out glasses within easy reach , arranging tables and chairs , speaking all the while , affably andp52humorously , of the other tenants in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he sat down himself , placing on Sophie 's lap with easy familiarity a small book of silhouettesof New England wild flowers . His voice was light , rather high , shattered almost comically now and then by a smoker 's cough , through which he continued to talk until he ran out of breath . His solicitousness was like an endearment ; there was a curious touch of precocity about it like that of an overly conscientious child . Sophie observed the charred edges of the table where he ate . He must deposit his cigarettes there while he cooked a chop for himself at the three-burner stove . An unwashed frying pan balancedon the edge of the drainboard . There were books heaped on tables  --  he said he would put up shelves when he had the time to bother  --  and dusty Venetian blinds at the two windows which faced the street , a couch , some cane chairs , a print of an Edvard Munch engraving on one wall . The door to a tiled box of a bathroom was ajar , and Sophie could see shaving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed almost frivolous to her that night , as he bantered mildly with Francis . There was a mysterious character to their apparent liking for each other . But a mystery need not be complex , she thought . Perhaps it was some simple thing that made them comfortable without troubling them with intimacy . Otto did n't have close friends . The long association with Charlie Russelhad , even by then , begun to be disfigured by a kind of sullennessbetween them . Otto had begun to think about Charlie , and what he had said to Sophie expressed a growing contempt of which , she thought , he himself had been hardly aware . The very qualities he had once admired in Russel became the focus of his disapproval . What he had once described as Charlie 's warmth and generosity , he now spoke of as impulsiveness and vanity . In a way , Sophie supposed , Otto had defined his own nature byp53contrasting it with his old friend 's . They were a good combination , he had always thought . Where he was inclined to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Charlie was imaginative . " Christ , he 's always spilling food on his clothes , " he had reported to Sophie one evening . " Just the way he did when we were in college . And I used to want to be like him ! I hated myselffor being so damned neat ! I thought it showed spiritual meanness . . . to be so fastidious . " So the erosion had begun . There was a man in California , a doctor , with whom Otto kept up a lively correspondence , although he rarely saw him unlessthere was a medical convention in New York . Sophie had thought him a cold man on the one occasion she had met him ; flatulent with country-squire theories of aristocracy and political postures to match . Yet Otto spoke of him with respect , even with fondness . Perhaps Otto liked Francis because he was so unaffectedly friendly . He was touching . Pleasing . " I do n't know a thing about nature , " Sophie said , looking through the book he had given her . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or wild flower . " Francis was at once concerned , thoughtful . " Jean , my wife , " he said , " is indifferent to the things themselves , but she does know the names of everything . It 's a peculiar mind . . . that kind . It catches her up , though . She only reads to form opinions and then she ca n't remember what she 's read , only the opinions . I would guess you 're quite different . " Sophie was vaguely flattered , although what he meant by different she did n't know . Still , she was a little uncomfortable ; the flattery was not only ambiguous but in poor taste . But she herself had been disingenuous . She knew the names of many plants and insects and flowers . Why had she offered him false ignorance ? To flatter him ? Or had he , by placing his book in her lap with facile geniality , irritated her ? And had her assertion been made not to show ig/norance but indifference to his concerns ? They had both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk about his work . He enjoyed , he said , the benefits of anonymity ; he was such an unappetizing bite that no big publisher bothered to eat him up , and he was free not only to publish pretty much what he wanted , but because he stayed strictly away from fiction he escaped the awful exigencies of fashion . He did his little bugs and plants ; the natural world was a thousand times more bizarreand interesting than human society . With a charming smile , he described the manner in which a certain larva managed to insinuate itself into the brain of a songbird in order to complete its metamorphosis . " Did you like him ? " Otto asked later as they pressed through the crowded lobby into the theater . " Yes , " she replied . " He 's nice , very nice . " " I do n't know that he 's nice . I would say he 's heartless , really . It 's odd . You see how . . . courtly he is , almost old-fashioned . He affects a large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keeps out of it . I think no one can really be like that  --  either you 're dismayed and baffled or you reduce everything to aestheticsor politics or sex sociology or whatever . But Francis  --  and by heartless , I do n't mean he 's hard  --  has an absolutely impenetrablesurface , although he appears to have none at all . He does n't take me in , yet I like him . He makes me feel cheerful . " It was , for Otto , a very long dissertation . Sophie looked at him in surprise . He handed her the program he 'd just been given by an usher who was , at the moment , gesturing impatientlyat their seats . They edged past two men wearing embroideredsilk vests and turned down the seats . " I 've never heard you go on so about anyone , " she said . " That 's why , " he replied . " Because I like him and I do n't see why I should . "  | " But are they really going to separate or get a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He 's always going out there to see her . Hesays she 's a realist . I think he means it as a complaint . Maybeit 's the way he says it , with that confiding grin of his . " " Maybe he loves her . " " Love ? I do n't know about that . In fact , that 's where his heartlessness really shows up . He wants to win . No matter what he says , I think she threw him out . Oh , he 's very dependent on her . . . she 's one of those organizing women , I 'd guess , sounded tough to me on the telephone , very tough . There 's plenty going on between them all right . He sits up there in his shabby old office and she takes care of the world . " " I wonder why she threw him out . " " I only suspect that . I 'm pretty sure he 's going to get back somehow . He told me he worries about the neighborhood childrencoming in to visit his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ special soap . " " Her soap ! " " English soap . Pears , he said . He 's full of peculiar details like that . " She held out to him the earphones for simultaneous translation . " Do you want these ? " " Why imply I have a choice ? " he grumbled , and took them . Despite her concentration on the stage , the first act was somewhatmarred for Sophie . Someone had dropped their earphones in apparent discouragement and left , and the tiny flat voice of the translator continued to pick shrilly at the air . The ushers did n't find the earphones until halfway through the play . Duringintermission , Otto , looking sleepy , wandered off to smoke a cigar . Sophie remained in her seat , aware that the program was slipping off her lap , but curiously inert , as though the cessation of the play had left her with nothing to think about , nothing to do . But just as Otto came down the stairs to their row , she satp56up straight , clutching at the glossy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that she lost the play until its penultimate moment . A few weeks later , Sophie arranged to meet Otto and Early at the Morgan Library to see an exhibition of plant and flower drawings . At the last minute Otto called home to say he could not make it . Long after Francis had returned to Locust Valley , his Munch engraving tucked under an arm , carrying a box of books by a wash-line cord , Sophie wondered what would have happened if Otto had not left them alone together . The answer depended on her mood . But she was unable to deceive herself when it came to recognizing the differing impulses which brought them both to Francis ' studio couch . For him , she might have been one of a number of others . But for her , he could only have been himself . She was thirty-five , too old for romance , she told herself as they got into a taxi on Thirty-ninth street and Madison . He gave his address . They faced forward rather stiffly . She read the cabdriver 's license @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't speak . Once Francis took her gloved hand in his and a tremor passed over her and her mouth went dry . She had , then , an anguished foreknowledge that she would be a long time missing him . But a moment later she forgot ; . the intensity of her feeling for him obliterated everything except itself . She recalled as in another life , his saying that his wife knew " the name of everything . " Had his voice been plaintive ? She had not listened cannily enough to understand , and it might have helped her now . But what if he had been plaintive ? What if his tone of voice had revealed an unalterable attachment ? What did she care for Jean , for the house in Locust Valley , the three children , for history , for Otto , for her own past , for what was to happen ? They had been looking down at a glass case , he talking somewhatpedantically about photoengraving , when he had lookedp57at her and smiled . Then he saw that her dazed glance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his blood rise , flooding his neck and his face . He took her wrist in his hand and said , " Oh ! " What she felt then had surely been rapture . He had recognizedall at once the violence of the emotion which possessed her , and her gratitude for that recognition obscured for a little t i me that recognition was the only provision he carried . Her wrist had twisted in his hand , her fingers had reached up and caught his shirt-cuff , then touched his skin . When , years later , she tried to recall the exact sound of his voice , remembering with a certain painful joy that it had been she who had evoked that startled flush , that involuntary " Oh ! , " she drove herself into despair . The voice would not come back ; she could not hear it . Not long after his lecture near the glass case , Sophie lay next to him on his couch , her head half off the edge , drowsily contemplatingher clothes piled up on a cane chair . By lifting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so pale now , so mysterious . She had not ceased to think about him since that evening in the theater . What had recently happened between them on the knobby mattress was as inextricably bound up with her first view of him as it was with the tension which had tightened around her throat like a garrotte , breaking at last into the plangentsilence of their undressing , then extinguished by the hasty violence of their embrace . Only now , his thin leg rolled off her thighs . She was moved by the air of transience and neglect in his room , by the smell of dust and lemon  --  perhaps some lotion that he used , or perhaps two lemons themselves on a table . Light seemed everywhere at once . Passionate endearments rose to her lips , but she did n't speak them . It was not shyness that kept her silent . She tried to force from her consciousness the painful apprehension that the room , except for her own presence , was empty . " Francis ? " she whispered . He coughed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where thep58fingers found a cigarette , a book of matches . Then it was withdrawn , the momentary warmth of his skin increasing her awarenessof the chill that was spreading over her flesh . " It 's all right , " he murmured . It did not seem he was even speaking to her . He stroked her arm . Gradually there appeared on his lips that familiar , winning , congenial smile . On the telephone , they sometimes talked about love . Once , she heard an extraordinary excitement in his voice ; she thought she had him , and suddenly freed from the presence of a shapeless and terrible weight , the unlovely issue of their love-making , she spoke without shame of her feeling for him . But when they met again , nothing seemed changed . But she had her secret hoarding ; seeing him as he searched for her in a bar where they met and where she , as usual , was early , watching him as he made coffee on his stove , noting with intense pleasure his long thin back , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he turned from time to time to say something to her . Later , during a time when there was no room in her thoughts for anything but remorseless obsessive recollection , a perverse desireto debase the tenderness she had felt for him led her to insistto herself that it had all been a kind of fatigued middle-aged prurience . And how she had grown to hate that amicability which had once given her such pleasure ! It was a shirt of mail , an expression of his unalterable detachment . Behind it lay his life 's desolation , his disappointment in himself , his failure with his wife , his real resentment at his hole-in-the-wall company and his self-contempt for his effort to make a virtue out of limitation . Yet he could n't seem to help himself  --  even his bitterness was somehow turned to personal profit . It added to his mystery ; it gave his smile an elusive sadness , and it was an element in that quality he had of always recognizing the real meaning thatp59lay behind people 's words , as though his soul attended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out and embrace them in universalawareness . She had once bought him a radio . She had given it to him in its cardboard box and while he undid the staples , she had smiled happily because he had said he must get himself a radio one of these days , because she had anticipated him and gotten him what he wanted . He accepted it gracefully ; his voice was touched with admiration  --  he admired thoughtfulness  --  and with the suggestion , the merest suggestion , that as a rule no one bothered to give him a gift , no one troubled , not that he minded . I le was just one of those men who were not given things . A week later when Sophie came to his room , he had another radio . He had been astonished , he said , when one of his writers , a warm-hearted lady naturalist , had simply sent it to him . It had FM , police calls , God knows what . It was leather-covered and very swank and powerful . " I can get the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the radio but did n't touch it . What had he done with hers ? Thrown it out the window ? She would like to have smashed the new radio on his dusty parquet floor . She smiled instead . She did n't know how to violatethat mutual smile of theirs . It was miasmic . It stayed on her face while she undressed . It would not go away , and she bore it home with her , a disfiguring rictus . Only a few weeks after their affair had begun , she suffered powerful interludes of scorn in which she saw herself to be a fool , the fool . Her shifting judgments on herself revealed to her how her involvement with Francis had shoved her back violentlyinto herself . In allowing himself to be loved by her , he had shown her human loneliness . Yet she had never looked better ; the whites of her eyes were as clear as a child 's , her dark hair was especially lustrous , and although she did n't eat much , she seemed to be bursting out of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ galvanized energy . Strain , she thought , became her , tightened up her face which was overly plastic , lightened her rather sallow olive skin . She did n't have a moment of repose , thinking , thinking , thinking about him . She grew arrowy . " You look like an arrow , " he said . She had raced to meet him , touched his arm , felt  --  through jacket and shirt sleeves , even , it seemed , through his flesh  --  his being draw away from her . Her heart gripped , dropped . He kissed her eyebrow . She inserted her hand between his trousers and his skin , feeling the small high buttock . He laughed and told her a story about a glass worm , how it could be sectioned , and the sectionswould survive . They drank a glass of white wine . Absently , he touched her ear lobe . She stood up . He backed her against a wall , pulled up her skirt . She tried to anticipate him . He pressed against her , suddenly turned away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard the zing of a coin as it rolled out of his pocket and hit the floor . On the couch , he knelt above her , looked down at her body with sharp unimpassioned curiosity . He could n't control a fit of coughing ; it rattled her insides , traveledup through belly and stomach and chest . She was outraged that he could make her laugh at that moment . But she could n't stop laughing . They fell off the bed . Her bones were n't such young bones , and they hurt . " I must give up either smoking or fucking , " he said . The gray return was before her . It was unthinkableto leave him . Sometimes she took a taxi . She rode home seeing nothing , her mouth slightly swollen , her cheeks rosy . It was clear when he had had enough , more than he had ever wanted . He asked her , did she imagine , had she ever imagined herself on a stage ? Why did he ask that ? Oh , he did n't know but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her emphasis . . . " You mean , histrionic ? " Well . . . not exactly . Then , one late afternoon , he told her he had to go back to LocustValley . He had to find out what had really gone on in thatp61marriage . If he did n't , how would he ever make another rela-tionship ? " Relationship ? " " I ca n't marry someone else until I know more about what happened between Jean and me , " he said . " Someone else , " cried her inner voice . He no longer referred mildly to his wife . When he spoke of her , his face grew creased , he looked away from Sophie at some object in the room , the bar , the restaurant . He went to see his children more frequently . He phoned Sophie an hour or two beforeshe was ready to leave the house to go to meet him , and said something had come up . He could n't see her that day . Next week perhaps . The last time she rose from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that she was covered with blood , and that the blood was the outline of his body on hers . What would her life have been if they had gone on together ? If she had been that " relationship " he spoke of ? It did n't matter . That they would have tired of each other , gone trundling down the worn ruts of sexual boredom and habit did n't matter . She had chosen him at a late moment in her life , when choices were almost always hypothetical . It was a choice out of time . " He 's gone back to Locust Valley , " Otto said one evening . " Who ? " she asked foolishly and in anguish . " Francis has gone back . He 'll stay this time , I think . " And then he said , " Something of a phony . " " I thought you liked him . " " I do . He 's a very appealing fellow . But I think he 's a phony . He ca n't help himself . " Had she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Valley because stale air was better than none at all ? But what did she know about the air in Locust Valley ? And was love suffocation ? Yet she could not expunge what she now knew . It was commitment , not even choice , just commitment ,  |p62and  against that rock everything broke , resolutions and desires , words and presumptions . No struggle she could envisage could have torn him loose from that commitment . It did n't matter what his wife was like . It would n't , she thought , even have matteredif he had loved her , Sophie . " What are you thinking about ? " Otto asked . It was , from him , an unusual question . Sophie flushed . " Marriage , " she said . He smiled , a simple , somewhat abstracted smile . That they should be sitting across from each other in the same way they had sat for so many years and that the habitual intimacy between them could have suffered so wrenching a violationwithout there being evidence of it , was harrowing to Sophie . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lived a life apart from Otto without his sensing something , it meant that their marriage had run down long before she had met Francis ; either that , or worse  --  once she had stepped outside rules , definitions , there were none . Constructions had no true life . Ticking away inside the carapace of ordinary life and its sketchy agreements was anarchy . She knew where she had been , she thought . Where had Otto been ? What had he been thinking ? Did n't he know anything ? She looked at him a long time across the table . He did not seem aware of her observation . He was eating a dish of applesauce she had made that afternoon . The spoon clanked softly . There was the lemon-flavored smell of apples . Otto rolled up the corner of his rumpled napkin with his left hand . His eyes , when he glanced across at her , gave back no reflection of what he saw . His forehead was faintly furrowed , his shoulders bent . He was beginning to speak about the war  --  a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his legal rights were if he declared himself a conscientious objector . Otto refused to talk to him when the boy said he 'd like to come and rap with him . " But you know what rap means , do n't you ? " she asked . " Only accidentally . What if I had spoken to him in German ,  |p63making  the fatuous assumption it was up to him to understand me ? " " But he needed help ! What does it matter how he asked for it ? " " I told him to talk straight to me . He said Wow . ' That jelly word ! Wow , wow , wow . . . what dogs say to the moon . Then he said he dug me , but he was simply doing his own thing in his own words , and I asked him where the fuck it was written anyone was supposed to do their own thing ? " " Oh , Otto ! " " Oh , shut up ! " he shouted , and he shoved himself back from the table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she had to make an effort of memory to visualize his expression as he had sat there . In anger , he had shouted at her and left the room . But the look she had seen on his face had not been one of anger but of bafflement ; the look of one who can find no reason for his affliction . Sophie did not see Francis until six months later , when he phoned her unexpectedly one day at noon . They were to meet for a drink . He was standing at the bar , reading a book , wearingglasses . " Hello , " she said . Her hand reached out to touch his arm , then she withdrew it . " Sophie , " he said . They sat at a small round table , their knees entangled until he turned his chair away . They talked about the book he was reading , a record of Sir Leonard Woolley 's excavations in the TurkishHatay near Antioch . It was his new interest , he said , preclassicalhistory . And how was she ? And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said , thinner , and she smiled , yes , yes , she was thinner than ever . She noted he was wearing glasses now . For reading , he said . The silences between them were a kind of sleep ; her eyes tended to close unless she heard his voice . He had coarsened a little , she thought , but she only asked him if he had put on weight . Perhaps he 'd never quite lose that fine fair look about his un/cluttered face , that limpidity of expression . It was only a vestigialgrace , she told herself , that had survived through adaptation , and been tainted by it . She told him she 'd not been too well . She did not say she had suffered an irreversible loss . Instead , she began , somewhat hesitantly , to catalog her ailments , fatigue , anemia  --  but saw and was quelled by some suggestion of irony as he listened to her . She could not have said in what it consisted , the faint smile , his narrowed eyes , the slight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taxi . She looked back through the cab window at him . He was not looking after her but was peering into the window of a shop.  |p65Otto  was standing by the window . The sky was ashen . Althoughshe could not see his face , Sophie saw that his attention was focused on something in the street . He held his pajamas in one hand . Naked , next to the jutting edge of a chest of drawers , he looked vulnerable , foreshortened and supplicating . When she rose from the warm bed , only the edge of her fatigue blunted , and went over to him , she saw his expression of somber distaste . " What time is it ? " she asked . " I do n't know . . . around seven maybe , " he replied , without looking at her . She followed the direction of his glance . On the opposite sidewalk , a Negro man reeled silently from stoop to curb and back again . With one hand , he gripped the bunched-up fabric of his pants . In the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buttocks above his wildly rocking legs had a kind of gravity . His sidewise progress suddenly propelled him into the post of a black-painted metal railing . He collapsed , his knees coming together in violent genuflection , his hat falling off , his bare bottom landing on the backs of his heels . He flung one hand into the air , the other gripped the rail , the green plane crushed against it . Then he began to vomit . A black car rattled past . They saw the Negro , his head fallen back , his eyes shut . His hat , only that second , came to rest in the gutter . With a frenzied lurch , he snapped forward again . " Do n't watch . . . " Sophie begged , pulling at Otto 's arm . " Ssh . . . " " Come away . Come to bed . " " Wait ! "  | " You should n't watch . It 's wrong of you . . . " " He 's fallen into it . " From somewhere behind their house , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , slipping and sliding through the still thick gray air . Sophie put her hand on Otto 's waist . He felt clammy . " I wish we could live in a place where they do n't torment dogs , " she said . " Versailles , " he muttered , then peered at her truculently . " Why are you up so early ? " he asked . Without waiting for a reply , he went off to the bathroom . She turned her attention back to the street . The Negro was prostrated in front of a metal garbage can that was chained to the railing he was still gripping . Even as she watched , his hand fell away and flopped onto the pavement , the green plane falling a few feet away . She grew suddenly aware of her own discomfort ; her mouth was coated , her body was exhausted and her mind debauched by memory . She had put herself to sleep again , nursing memories of Francis Early , like an old crone with a bit of rag for a baby . Her arms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She heard the toiletflushing , then running water , then the padding sound of Otto 's feet as he came back to the bedroom . She would like to have gone back to sleep , but she remained standing there in front of the window across which she had drawn the curtains , feeling their grittiness . She realized she 'd have to have them cleaned . The Negro shifted slightly . " God ! He 's getting up , " she said . Otto sighed and fell into bed , covering himself with the blanket . " How 's the bite ? " " Better , I think , " she said , turning on a small table lamp and looking down at her hand . The swelling was still prominent but the redness had diminished . " It 's sore . My whole arm is sore . But it looks better . "  | " You ought to get a tetanus shot today . You can get one anywhere . " He sounded wearied by the whole subject . " Oh , it 'll be all right , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stared at her through half-closed lids . " You do drift , Sophie , " he said . " There are certain things one should just do without fuss . " " Maybe he 's not drunk . Maybe he 's ill , " she said . " He 's drunk , " Otto said . " Come along to bed . " " How do you know ! " " Do n't shout . " " Ca n't you leave room for doubt ? Maybe he 's had an epileptic fit ! A heart attack ! You 're so full of cunning , catching everyone out . . . the American form of wisdom ! What if he is drunk ! Is n't that bad enough ! " Slowly , Otto drew the blanket up over his head . His legs stuck out beneath it . Her jaws clamped into a vise , Sophie ran to the bed and snatched off his covering . He reached out and grabbed her around the thighs and she fell across him . " You talk too much , " he said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pejorative . Do you hate your country ? " " I hate you , " she replied . " A lot ? " " No . " Suddenly drained of the nervous excitement which had made her forget momentarily her tiredness and the monochromatic dullness of this early morning , she buried her face in the edge of the bed . Otto , somewhat apathetically , began to stroke her back beneath her nightgown . She was grateful that they had not fought  --  she did n't have the energy  --  but a sullen disappointmentroiled about just behind her gratitude . Was Otto going to make love to her while the Negro in the street slept in his own vomit ? She summoned her former lover 's ghost . He sat in the straight-backed chair , wearing a brown suede jacket . He wasn'tp68looking at her . A brassiere hung over the chair back where she had left it , and Francis leaned forward slightly as though to avoid contact with it . She willed him to sit back . He began to fade away . In Locust Valley , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who knew the name of everything . . . . A tear straggled down her cheek . She would never be rid of him . Otto 's hand was motionless . She listened to his breathing . He was asleep . By midmorning , when they awoke , the sky was clear , rosy , hopeful . " What are you going to do today ? " he asked her over breakfast . " Have lunch with Claire . " " I wish you 'd see the doctor . " " I 'll call Noel this afternoon . " " You will ? " " He wo n't be in on Saturday . " " Then the answering service will have him call . " " Answering services are there to muffle the screams of the dying , " she said . " I wish I did n't have to go in today , " he said . " Charlie 's going has just raised havoc in a small way . " She got up abruptly and carried their dishes to the kitchen . When she returned , he was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a book poking out at an angle and idly reached in and pulled it out to see the title . Then she opened it to a scrap of paper marker . " Are you reading this ? " she asked . He glanced at the book and nodded . It was The Death of Ivan Ilyich . She went with him to the front door . " He 's gone , " she said , looking through the glass insets . " Who ? " " That Negro man . Just gone . "  | " An angel carried him away , " he said . " The cat has n't come back , has it ? " " I have n't seen it . " He paused , reached for the doorknob , then touched her hair . " Did you come down here and read last night ? I woke up once and you were n't in bed . " She began to laugh , not wanting to , trying to stop . " Sophie ? " " I was n't even here in the house , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Charlie came here in the middle of the night and wanted to talk . He came to see you , he said . He was a little drunk . We went to a bar on Clark Street . " She was still laughing . Fou rire , she told herself sternly . He pulled her back into the hall . " Why did n't you wake me ? Why did n't you say a word until just now when I have to leave ? " " That 's why I 'm laughing . Because I forgot . I simply forgot . " He dropped his briefcase on the floor . " You 're infuriating , " he said quietly . " Why did you say to him , lots of luck , fella ' ? " she asked mulishly , and immediately wished she had n't . She had felt a stab of impatience with him ; her own laughter had upset her , but she had n't meant to mortify him , and she had , with a report to him on his silliness , not an insult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she cried . " Oh . . . I 'm sorry for that . " His voice was almost inaudible . " Do n't bother to tell me anything else .... " " He was angry , " she said helplessly . " He was trying to get at you through me . He was hurt because he feels you were n't givingthe thing its weight , the end of your partnership . . . that you 're indifferent . Oh , I do n't know .... " He looked blankly at his wristwatch . " I 've done so much of the work for years , " he said . His tones were measured , but hep70was staring fixedly at her shoulder , which felt a faint strain as though he were leaning against it . " Charlie is winsome . There 's a kind of flattery , you understand , that he 's adept at . " He paused . She sensed that he was speaking without much thought and she knew he did n't believe much in the efficacy of words which were , after all , only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had not much to do with what they said about themselves , or what others said about them . She felt a rush of sympathy for him . He was not able to say what he meant . " I know , " she said quickly . " I know exactly what you mean . " It touched her profoundly that neither of them knew . He looked very tired . " Must you go in ? " she asked . " The files . . . " he said . " There 's so much to be done . He 's taking a lot of business with him . I do n't even know yet how many clients . " " You care about him . " " Yes . He got me , too . " " But you have clients who 'd rather stay with you . " " Do I ? " he smiled faintly . She felt an impulse to tell him about the phone call and Charlie 's admission . That she had spent hours with Charlie , being Otto 's listless defender , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breathed into the telephone like one disordered in mind seemed to her a dangerous piece of information . She did n't know why . " He wants a new life , " Otto said , picking up his briefcase . " Even Charlie wants that . " He left then , quite suddenly , shuttingthe door on her good-bye . She was startled at his words . " A new life . " It was one of those melancholy asides people of a certain age were given to . But not Otto . She wondered if Charlie would try to see Otto today and thought not . With no special sense of how she had arrived at such a conclusion , she was now sure that Charlie did not really want to confront Otto ; he was like the stage character whop71shouts " Let me at him " at a safe distance from his opponent . It occurred to her suddenly that she had n't mentioned Charlie 's phone call because of her own disclosure to him . Why in God 's name had she told him !  |p72On  Saturdays , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clothes ; old boys and girls in faded jeans and paint-spattered shirts cultivated the earth around the frail young trees on the sidewalk , or stood and gazed up at their houses with preoccupied stares . One carried a pail or a hose or a paintbrush , another , a scraper for the drops of paint spotting their new windows , another , a ladder to rest against the wall to climb and repair a weathered window strip . Both sides of the street were lined with cars , many of which were small and foreign , some bearing a prominent label indicating the car had been purchasedin Germany or France or England . Sophie , looking out from behind the living room curtains , saw a man hosing down a section of his sidewalk near his stoop . With rigid arms , he held the nozzle of the hose close to the pavement and his expression was stern . As she watched , he suddenlydropped the hose and retrieved from the earth around his maple the green airplane . He stuffed it into his garbage can , alreadyoverflowing , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the house , dogs imprisoned in small yards ran in circles . Telephone cables , electric wires , and clothes lines crossed and recrossed , giving the houses , light poles , and leafless trees the quality of a contour drawing , one continuous line . The Bentwood yard was covered with gravel threaded by a narrow brick path which branched out to an iron bench painted white , a stone cherub carrying a barely discernible cornucopia and to the lip of a small cement pool . Here and there were several yew trees growing in tubs and patches of mountain laurel which the Bentwoods had stolen , cutting by cutting , from Route 9 on thep73Jersey shore of the Hudson . Bare spots in the even texture of the gravel testified to the hole digging of cats . Sophie stood for a moment at the back door . A white-andgraycat straddled a wooden fence and watched a sparrow , motionlesson the limb of an ailanthus tree . She did n't know what she was thinking about as she pressed her forehead against the glass , but she felt a quick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . The house was silent in a specialway on Saturday ; she went from window to window , wishing herself dressed and out , yet staring passively at the street as though she were waiting for a sign . Indolently , she ascended the stairs . Languidly , she dressed . But once on the sidewalk , her mood underwent an abrupt turn ; as she walked up Court Street to the Borough Hall subway station , she felt exhilarated . She had n't told Charlie anything , really . Francis had probably been right about her  --  she did have a taste for melodrama , and Charlie 's nocturnal visit had stimulatedit . The cat was healthy . She was going to get away with everything ! Dressed in a coat of French tweed , shod by a Florentine , she waited on the subway platform , her real life as masked as those of the people who strolled past her or leaned against the blackenedscarred shafts that supported the ceiling . Then to her dismay , her eyes filled with tears . She found a handkerchief in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she found two messages ; one , written in chalk , said : Kiss me someone , and the other , scratched with a key or a knife , said : Fuck everybody except Linda . In the train she opened the book she had taken from her night table . It was an English edition of Renee Mauperin . She stared at a drawing of the Goncourt brothers all the way to FultonStreet . As she turned the pages , her eyes fell upon a sentence : " Illnesses do their work secretly , their ravages are often hidden . " It would sound , she thought , less medical and morep74ominous in French , more universal . She closed the book and tried to pull a glove over her left hand ; the pain came at once . It had been there all the time , lying in wait inside her hand . The train was crowded now , and there was the stale , warm , soupy smell of crowds . She could have taken a taxi into the city , but it would have been self-indulgence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one . Sophie was plagued by a vision of herself sliding effortlessly toward a sickly dependence on bodily comfort . Now , she breathed resolutely of the odious air and covered the throbbing hand with the other . The less attention she gave it , the better . Before going to Claire 's , where she was not expected until noon , Sophie stopped by the Bazaar Provencal , a small kitchenequipmentshop on East Fifty-eighth Street . She wanted an omelet pan  --  it sat , substantial as its own metal , in a hazy domestic dream : a middle-aged couple sitting together over their omelette aux fines herbes , two glasses of white wine , one half of a grape cheese , two pears in a milk glass bowl ... . " This one is made better , " said an elderly woman , whose sacklike chin was covered with a bristle of stiff gray hairs . " Is it the size you wanted ? " " How big is this ? " Sophie asked . " I 'd have to measure it . You 've got to season the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instead an hourglass egg timer . Useless . The store smelled of excelsior packing , oiled metal , and the faintly brackish odor of Vallauris pottery . She handed the woman money . " Your hand is bleeding , " the woman observed coldly . " No , it 's not . " " Yes . See ? You must have banged it on something . " A single drop of blood oozed from the wound . " Oh . Perhaps I did . "  |p75The  woman opened a huge black purse and extracted from it a Kleenex , which she thrust at Sophie . " We do n't have much space in here , " she said . " All these new shipments arrived yesterday . " " I did n't do it in here . I 'm sure I did n't , " Sophie said . " People have to watch where they 're going . " The woman pushed some coins into Sophie 's hand . The hairs on her chin were like little metal filings ; they appeared to vibratelike antennae in search of prey . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exclaimed suddenly . " What ! What ! " the old woman cried , and threw up her hands as though to ward off a hex . Sophie stuck the unwrapped hourglass in her bag and fled . Claire Fischer lived in a studio apartment not far from CentralPark West . The outer texture of the building suggested powerfully an accretion of natural matter rather than man-made material . The whole surface was covered with dollops of some substance that looked like solidified guano . Beneath the black beams of the lobby 's low ceiling , a trickle of light seeped through filthy stained-glass windows . The apartments were all duplexes and commanded enormous rents . Sophie walked up the service stairs to the second floor , where she found Claire 's door ajar . She went in and felt , as usual , a disquieting perplexity when she looked at the two-story living room , the oak staircase leading to bedrooms on the balcony above , the marble fireplace with its Victorian grate , the massive shabby furniture . Claire called it thirties-stupid . Sophie sensed that in its profound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was an element inimical to her own sense of order : for that same reason , she coveted it . On every available surface Claire had piled her assemblagesof shells and stones , dried seaweed , leaves , bits of worn glass and dried plants . The total effect was that of an obsessive attempt to re-create the natural world in miniature ,  |p76but  without design . It was an accumulation , not a display . " Claire ? " said Sophie . " In here ! " came an answering shout . Sophie went to the kitchen beneath the balcony . Here , the apartment narrowed into sordidness . The kitchen was awful ; roach caravans trailed across counters and walls , and the appliancesmight just as well have been in the city dump . Claire was stooping over a pail near the stove . " What are you doing ? What have you got there ? " " Look at this , " Claire said , without changing her stance or looking up . Sophie stood beside her and looked down into the pail . " That 's cornmeal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clams at the bottom will come up for it , you see , thereby clearing the sand from their craws . Is n't that ingenious ? Of me , not the clams . Did you say hello to Leon ? " " I did n't know he was here , " Sophie replied . Claire straightened up and presented Sophie with her grave , heavily lined face . Her eyes were bright blue , the whites faintly bloodshot . A network of thin red veins spread out from the centerof her short blunt nose . When she smiled , as she did now , touching Sophie on the shoulder with one finger , Sophie saw the dim pink inside of her mouth , and little patches of gold where her teeth had been capped . Her short-cropped graying hair stood straight up all over her head . She often ran her hand through that thicket as though to assure herself it was still there . Although she was a heavy woman , she did not look plump  --  sturdy , rather . Habitually she stood with her feet wide apart , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stability . She was dressed in a man 's shirt , a skirt made from an Indian cotton throw , white socks and alpargatas ; the rope sole of one was partly unraveled . A scarf was tied in a knot around her middle . " He 's probably lying down upstairs , " she said now . " He'sp77dreadfully tired . I think his wife is driving him into the ground . " " I did n't know he was married again , " Sophie said . " He married a graduate student of his last spring , a dull , dull girl who 's convinced herself she 's a creature of unbridled lust . That 's what he tells me , anyhow . Will you have gin or whisky ? " " Gin . " " He tells me a great deal more than I want to hear about that side of things . Do you want vermouth or tonic or what ? He does like to treat me like his charlady instead of his first bride . He 's like most of them though  --  passionate selflessness until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Tonic . Why do n't you tell him to keep it to himself ? " " That would hurt his feelings . He says she fooled him by writing a very good thesis on Henry James . . . some peculiar angle on his relationship to his brother . . . I do n't know . He was lavish in his praise  --  I 'll say that for him , he 's generous that way  --  and the next thing he knew she was swearing there was more between them than a silly old thesis about silly old Henry . He 's always been a brain lover , swears he would n't touch a woman unless she had a stylish brain . Well , she 's absolutelydippy . He hates to go home at night , hides out in the universitylibrary . She 's always waiting for him behind the door , stark naked , liberated from intellectual concerns , his beast , she calls herself . I met them in the lobby of a theater one evening and she sulked for days , Leon tells me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think there 's a goat quartered in this kitchen . Come on , let 's get out of here . " In the living room , Claire fell into a monstrous chair covered with a kind of brown bearlike fuzz . Her skirt flew up . In contrast to the rest of her , her legs were thin , and blue veins showed through the white skin.  | " You look elegant , Sophie . How are you ? " " Fine . . . no , not so fine . " " Look at those shoes ! Made by some European slave for a lira , right ? What multitudes we all recline upon ! I thought my vanitywould subside by the time I was fifty , but it 's gotten worse . That 's why I dress this way . I 'd rather look like an aged go-go girl than a middle-class frump . There used to be a tribe in Africa that flung women who were fifty over a cliff . But I suppose they 've become enlightened by now . How 's Otto ? " " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the firm . Otto does n't say much about it . Charlie is taking it very hard . " " Otto did n't kick him out , did he ? " Sophie hesitated . " No , it was n't that . They were n't getting along . " " Well , then , it 's a good thing , is n't it ? " " I do n't know . It 's been a long association . Charlie seems very bitter . He talks as if Otto had somehow betrayed him . " " I do n't believe that . I would n't believe anything Charlie said . " " You do n't know anything about him . " " That weekend I spent in Flynders with all of you was enough . " " You sound like Otto , " Sophie said sharply . " He does n't think about people more than two minutes at a time , then by some supernaturalagency presumes to arrive at total insight . " " Total insight ! " repeated Claire , laughing . " Sounds like a depot in North Dakota @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In fact , I did n't get Charlie at all  --  it was the way he offeredhimself , like a platter of antipasto , then stood back and seemed to watch one consume it . I did n't like him . His attitudes were impeccable , all that good liberal stuff spread out before one , so reassuring , so appetizing , so flattering . I do n't like impeccableattitudes. "  | " No holy fools enter paradise , " said a voice from the ceiling . Sophie looked up and saw Leon Fischer leaning against the balcony , looking down morosely at Claire . He was fat and yellowishskinned and his blazer jacket was too tight . " Come on down , Leon , " Claire said . " Come and see Sophie . " " I can see her from here , " Leon said crossly . " Claire , I knocked over a box on your dresser . What new madness has taken hold of you ? " " What box ? " " Full of horrible little instruments like bugs . They 've all rolled away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pick them up but I was overwhelmed by the dust . Do n't you ever clean up around here ? " " No , I do n't , Leon . " " What are you doing with all these misshapen little horns and flutes and drums ? " " I play with them , " Claire said complacently . " Since I ca n't afford the large ones , I have small ones . " Leon started down the stairs very slowly , gripping the banisterwith a hand that looked as soft as a glove full of water . " Who is a holy fool ? " Claire asked , watching his downward progress with a look of intense concern , as though he were a child whose first staircase venture this was . " I was thinking of my son . I do n't know whom Blake had in mind . " " Do you want a drink ? " " No . What have you done with the Chateau Margaux ? " " It 's taken care of . " " What have you done with it ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sinking down next to Sophie and emitting an enormous quavering sigh . " Are you working on anything ? " Claire asked Sophie . " Not at the moment . Perhaps I will , later on . "  | " How pleasant it must be not to be working on anything , " said Leon . " How pleasant to read , uncompromised by purpose . You must be rich . " " I do n't feel seriously about work any more , " Sophie said coldly . " It 's not a matter of money . " Leon coughed up a creaking laugh . " If you did n't have money , you 'd find it a serious matter , " he said . " I 've done a Russian movie , " Claire said . " Thank God they 're still stuck in realism , Zola-crazy . Subtitling their films is like captioning a child 's picture book . " " I 'm Zola-crazy , " said Leon . " I 'm crazy about everything up to January first , 1900 . What did you do with that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try a translation ? " Sophie asked Claire . " It takes too long . I have no patience for anything except cooking . And the pay is insulting . " " That 's because you 're rich . The rich are always being insultedby money . . . . Why are you wearing your hair in an Afro , Claire ? Why the hell do n't you pull yourself together ? " " Go back to your idiot wife , old man , " Claire said exasperatedly . " Are you hungry , Sophie ? I 've done a lovely lunch . " " I should be home , " Leon announced to no one in particular . " I should be reading a ghastly M.A. thesis . It tortures me . You ca n't imagine how it tortures me . . . . The woman is a teacher who wants to advance herself and she hates the subject , which she chose herself , and she hates me . It 's all a swindle . " " When Leon and I were married , centuries ago , " Claire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a meeting turned into a party and I sat at Leon 's feet and listened to the men talk . Oh . . . how they talked ! It was , I guess , civilized babble . It certainly did n't resemble anything I 'd ever heard in Concord where I grew up  --  and yet , what I remember , all I remember , is not what they all talked about , but the wives , especiallythe older ones , waiting like pensioners for a personal word or two . "  | " Nonsense ! " said Leon impatiently . " You 're being grossly sentimental . You always hated intellectuals because they made you feel like a Gentile poop ! " " Intellectuals ! " she cried . " Those dilettantes ! Those self-aggrandizingfops ! " " Oh , Claire ! " he protested . " Oh , do n't talk like that ! " He looked genuinely hurt . " Do n't yell at me , " she said . " You upset me . Those were serious people  --  " " All right , all right , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his head . They looked for a long time at each other , then Leon , speaking very softly , asked , " Did you put the wine in the icebox ? You never learn anything . I 'm sure you 've stuck it in the icebox . " Claire scowled and shifted in her chair just enough to give the impression she was turning her back on Leon . " Are you going to Flynders for the summer ? " she asked Sophie . " I think we will . " " Your husband is a lawyer , is n't he ? " Leon said . " You have children ? No ? You 're better off . I have a son by my second wife . I 'm sure you remember her , Claire . " He giggled faintly . " He 's twenty , with the mind of a newborn . I got a letter from him yesterday  --  he must have found a stamp in the gutter  --  which I made the error of reading before my first class  --  **26;11149;TOOLONG fiction  --  and it was supposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great oneness of everything  --  you ought to read Freud 's letter to Romain Rolland on that , by the way  --  about his father , who denies the oneness of everything , about his prayer for his father to be liberated from his bourgeois bonds . It is his belief that history began in 1948 , the year of his birth . I have tried to dissuade him of this delusion , but my knowledge is no match for his ignorance . At the very hint of an idea from me , he smiles at me gently as though I were eternally damned . He wears a rubber band around his hair to keep it out of his eyes when he studies the wall in front of him , where his visions arise ,  |p82and  he lives in a horrible slum house in East Orange . If only he wanted to save something , the world , for example . But he is stupid , stupid . The only foundation of his privilege , me , has to lecture forever on William Dean Howells , who bores me sick . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Claire sadly . " It 's all I do have . " " In 1939 , you handed out leaflets on Sixth Avenue . There was n't a question you did n't have an answer for . " " And you and I lived together , " Leon said . " We never talked about love . " " It was n't necessary . " " We were all of one sex , " she said , laughing wildly . " Yes , yes . . . . " Leon cried excitedly . " No one paid for us ! On Fridays I went to the Bronx and lit candles for my mother , readingon the subway , happy , greedy . And I worked for the Podjerskisand , although they paid me next to nothing , sometimes they asked me for advice because I was a college boy ! They drank tea all day long , leaving their greasy fingerprints on the glasses , and they knew all their employees by first name ; sometimes they played pinochle with the old man  --  oh , what was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On Fridays , they closed the shop early so we could all get home before sunset . Once I cut a slice of salamiin front of them with a knife I had just used for cheese , and they screamed with horror , would have fired me outright if I had n't been going to night school . " " I must reheat the Potage Fontange , " Claire announced . She retied the scarf around her waist , which had come loose as she smoked and listened , her glance resting on Leon , then on Sophie , with remote interest , like someone who does not particularlycare for fish but finds herself imprisoned in an aquarium . " Why must you dress that way ! " Leon exclaimed irritably . " Mother Garbage ! Do you think character is an excuse for any/thing ? Oh , you should have seen her in the old days , Margaret . . . " " Sophie . " " Sophie . What a blue-eyed beauty she was ! And moved like lightning , fixed leaking toilet tanks and knew how to repair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " It was Kemtone , " Claire called from the kitchen . " We moved into those awful rooms with busted windows and torn linoleumon the floors , ceilings the color of rotten peaches . . . . I painted everything with it . Remember ? " " She could n't cook then , " he said . " We lived on canned macaroniand bacon and whatever I could steal from my mother , like the salami I used to take for my lunch . What has become of us all ? " " Age , " said Claire from the kitchen entrance . " And so many already dead . " Sophie felt that she was sitting in a rain of ashes . She leaned forward , her head down , her eyes half closed , feeling the soft tide mounting to her knees . The ice had melted in her drink . Leon moved heavily on the sofa beside her . Suddenly she felt his ponderous hand on her shoulder . The fingers moved with the restlessness of an elderly person . She turned toward him . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's age . No one wants to talk about that , do they ? No . Humiliations of the bowels . My own body has turned against me . Did you hear how she said that one word ? With that female coziness ? Trying to neutralize it ? " His hand fell away from Sophie 's shoulder . " There 's nothing one can do about it , " Sophie said , but he did n't hear her for at the same time he had begun to shout . " You never did pay any attention to me ! " " I always paid attention to you , Leon , " Claire said , coming back to the living room , drying her hands slowly withp84a towel . " I just did n't listen . We are not married any more . " " Damn you ! Why did n't you marry again ! " " I did n't feel like it , " she said , smiling . " Ah , the truth , at last ! " he cried . " Behind all that frantic energyI thought was so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to live with someone else . " " We always wrangle like this , " Claire said to Sophie . " Just ignoreit , if you can . We can get along nicely when we cook together . " She smiled and returned to the kitchen . " It 's all that 's left , " Leon said in a suddenly weak voice . " It 's what is left of civilization . You take raw material and you transformit . That is civilization . Physical love is all raw meat . That 's why everyone 's so preoccupied with it now . I have been told by a colleague ten years older than myself  --  as if it were possible for anybody to be ten years older than I am  --  that salvation comes from staring at the pubic region of strangers , and freedom , from inducing in myself , by the use of a chemical , the kind of ecstatic lunacy in which I spent most of my adolescence , a conditionI attribute solely to the strength of my body at that time and the conviction I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during my lifetime . Now that my bones are weak , my brain is stronger . I do n't expect . . . anything . But I can not bear the grotesque , lying piety of my own unhinged contemporaries . One man , a literary star "  --  and here he broke off , laughed once , choked and shook his head  --  " oh , yes , a star , told me he only regretted the pill had not yet been developed in his own youth . All those girls who might have been his ! In this age of generalized cock , is this the whole revelation toward which my life has been directed ? I would , in any case , prefer to contemplatethe organ of a horse . It is handsomer , larger and more comic than anything my fellow man has to show . It is the age of baby shit , darling . Do n't kid yourself . My privacy has been violated  --  whatI 've admired and thought about all my life has been debased . Poor bodies . . . poor evil-smiling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us . " He reached out and pressed her shoulder . " Do you understand me ? " he asked . " A little , " she said , looking at his exhausted face , pitying him for his harshness which might be only an old habit of words . Do you understand my suffering ? is what he had really asked her . She leaned toward him just a little . He patted her shoulder with something akin to tenderness  --  perhaps it was tenderness , grown clumsy from disuse . " Come and eat my beautiful soup , " said Claire . Leon held Sophie'sarm , and she adjusted her pace to conform to his hesitant shuffle . The light which came through the dining room windowswas so murky it seemed to have texture . On the bare table were soup bowls with covers shaped like artichokes and huge faded linen napkins of pale apricot . Leon , standing at the head of the table , was smiling . It was the kind of unconscious smile , Sophie thought , that touches the face in the same way that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Leon asked , in a tone of such gentle inquirythat Claire shot him a suspicious glance , where she had found fresh sorrel ? When they had finished , Claire brought in eggs poached in black butter and a bottle of white Bordeaux . After a bowl of fruit was placed in the middle of the table and the espresso coffee was poured , Leon seemed to be dozing . " He 's in a state of innocence , " Claire whispered to Sophie . Leon grinned sleepily . The strain around his eyes had momentarilydisappeared and Sophie saw what he may have looked like so many years before when he had handed out leaflets on Sixth Avenue . She reached for a handful of grapes . Claire , looking idly to see what she had taken from the bowl , touched the back of Sophie 's hand with a roughened fingernail . " What 's that ? " " A cat bit me . " " Someone you know , I hope . " " It was a stray . " " Have you had it looked at ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It 's nothing , " she said . " A llama bit me once , " said Leon in a dreamy voice . " I reluctantlytook Benny to the children 's zoo when he was small  --  it was supposed to be the thing to do  --  and a dirty demented llama reached over the fence and clamped its jaws on my hand . It was like being bitten by dirty laundry . " " Cat bites are always something , " Claire said . " It 's much better , " said Sophie . " The grapes are sour , " Leon complained . " Let me see it . When did it happen ? " Claire demanded . Sophie shook her head , saying decisively , " It 's of no consequence . " " You will duck into supermarkets , wo n't you , Claire ? God ! If I had your leisure , I 'd take my shopping sack all over the city before I 'd settle for sour grapes . " " Oh , Leon , shut up ! " He rose from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be on the edge of physical collapse . He began to stack plates . Sophie pushed back her chair , ready to help . " No , " Claire said . " Do n't touch them . He always does them . It 's part of the agreement . " The two women stood , for a moment , at the window . A truck went by , a car , a man carrying an empty pail ; two short women in tall hats held each other 's arms tightly and moved defiantly through invisible crowds . " Are you ever afraid around here ? " " No , " Claire said . " I 'm not afraid of anything like that . " " Nothing at all ? " " Not at the moment . Not this week , anyhow . " Plates banged in the kitchen . " Let 's go sit down , " said Claire . They returned to the living room . " It 's this way , " Claire said . " If someone shoots me in the street , it will be quick , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a hospital operating room forp87someone to walk down the corridor from the laboratory with the dirty news on a piece of glass . " " Your kitchen sponge looks like a spoiled liver , " Leon shouted from the kitchen . " Use your shirt , " Claire said . She contemplated Sophie , who stirred uncomfortably , not knowing why she should feel so . She knew Claire was inclined , at times , to strike a somewhat oracularstance  --  something of a fraud , was n't she ? Still , Sophie fidgeted . " You have n't called for so long , " Claire said at last . " I wondered what hit you . And you know me , I never call anybody . " " I do n't know . I felt like seeing you . " " Oh , I 'm glad to see you . Things are pretty bleak around here , and there 's something luxurious about you that reminds me of nice things . But you 're so abstracted . I could feel it all the time Leon and I were doing our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time now . Are you back with that man again ? Ca n't remember his name . Maybe you never told me . You were so angry when I told you I thought he sounded ignominious . " " Because you thought I was bad to do what I did ... " " Bad , bad , bad , " Claire said , smiling . " Yes , I did think that . But it was easy for me to say , I never . . . " She hesitated and turned toward the kitchen , where they could both see Leon cleaning up with the single-minded , controlled ferocity of a performingbear . " I never had anything like that , " Claire continued . " I suppose the nearest I 've come to it is him . " She gestured over her shoulder at the kitchen . " And not when we were married . Not then . But now . You must think it 's ridiculous . . . but he touches me , you see . I do n't feel that I have enough time left for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think I 've never really liked sex . I 'll tell you something funny . Sometimes he sleeps here with me . We lie together all night long with our arms around each other , and I wake up in the night and I am happy . It is a kind of loving , is n't it , Sophie ? We can just be thep88way we are , with each other . If he did n't come by to see me , I think I 'd blow away like milkweed . Sometimes , in the late afternoons , I sit for hours until evening comes . When it is dark  --  not that it can ever be really dark in the city  --  I get up and make myself a little supper , a chop , some frozen lima beans . If he 's here , of course , I have to be a gourmet . Days like paper chains . All I 've got is that old man whom I dumped twenty years ago after he knocked up a Trotskyite lady vamp named Carla . " She leaned forward with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said softly . " He thinks one of his students might try to drug him . He says they harangue him about drugs all the time . Now he 's afraid to have coffee in the cafeteria at the university . He even thinks the faculty dining room might be dangerous . He told me just before you arrived that he now knows how scared old ladies are of being raped . He says that 's exactly the way he feels .... " She looked back at the kitchen . The corners of her mouth turned down . " Although , God knows , he 's been on a trip ever since he married that sex-addled bluestocking of his , " she said disgustedly . " Oh . . . you see how it is . I started out with you and ended up with myself . " Claire was waiting for her to say something but Sophie was silent , bemused . " Sophie ? " " No , no . It ended long ago , " Sophie said . " I saw him once . He was polite . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I was grateful when you asked me to come . I 'm depressed by my idleness , I guess . " " Neither of us had children , " Claire said , a note of wonder in her voice . Sophie laughed . " Come off it ! " she said brusquely , getting back at Claire for something , perhaps for waking up happy in the middle of the night . " Well . . . how is Otto ? " " You already asked me that , " Sophie replied . " He 's fine , con/sidering . I think he 's better off than some , perhaps because he 's not much given to introspection . He 's too preoccupied with fightingoff a mysterious effluvium he thinks will drown him . He thinks garbage is an insult directed against him personally , and he 's still trying to wash the dishes before we 've finished eating . " " What bitchiness ! " exclaimed Leon , who was standing in the door , wiping a glass . " No wonder men weep . " " I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But Sophie felt a tremor that seemed to strike her heart . She knew her face had reddened and her breath was short . She had not meant to sound so . . . baleful . And last night , she had wanted Charlie to go on , implying Otto was inhuman , shut away . " I 'm sorry , " she said . " Leon is right . When I open my mouth , toads fall out . I 'm sorry . " Leon looked surprised , then embarrassed . He held up the glass . " Claire , this is the way to dry a glass ! " But the hectoring tone was not in his voice . Claire , murmuring something about a chicken , got up from her chair and went to the kitchen , and Sophie , reluctant to be left alone with the echo of her own words , followed Claire . " I 'd better go , " she said dubiously , looking at Leon as he mopped up a counter , and then at Claire , who was staring down at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for you to go , " Claire said over her shoulder . " What are you going to do with that bird ? " Leon asked . " Tarragon and cream , " she answered . " Who 's coming ? " " Edgar and his new friend , some hairdresser . " " Can I stay ? " " No . " " What lousy company you keep ! And I suppose you 'll use those clams you 've been torturing and my wine ! " Claire , a cigarette drooping from her lips , was sprinkling the chicken ; a few cigarette ashes floated down to join the tarragon.  | " Fairies ! " exclaimed Leon , rinsing the sponge . " Let 's have tea at the Plaza next week , " Claire said to Sophie . " I 'll dress up and we 'll sit in the Palm Court and talk about the war and movies . " " Women that hang out with homosexuals are spiders , " said Leon , touching the chicken breast with one soft finger . " Thanks for lunch , Claire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Sophiesaid . Leon laughed . " It 's never nice to see me , " he said . A hank of gray hair fell over one of his pouchy eyes . With a quick touch , Claire pushed it back over his forehead . He grunted and scowled . At the door , Claire said , " Take care of your cat problem . " She handed Sophie her coat . " What a pretty one ! Where is it from ? Ireland ? France ? You carry the globe on your back , Sophie . Do n't forget to phone me and do n't worry about Charlie and Otto . Otto will be better off on his own . Which reminds me . . . wait ! " And she left Sophie abruptly and went up the stairs , taking two at a time , her skirt flying above her white legs . When she returned , she was holding a book . " Otto loaned me that a year ago . Do n't tell him , but I did n't finish it . He was so pleased when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was , at the time . I did start it . " She handed it over . It was The CommonLaw , by Oliver Wendell Holmes , Jr . Holding it , Sophie felt she had misplaced Otto , and the book was the only tangible evidence of his continuing existence somewhere . She was filled with foreboding and sadness , and her good-bye to Claire was almost inaudible . The door closed.  |p91So|phie  ran down the stairs and through the lobby , coming to a breathless halt outside the entrance of the building . A hairpin that had worked loose slipped down the back of her dress and fell out on the sidewalk . She looked at her watch . It was four o'clock . She did n't think that the two of them , back up there on the second floor , would be talking about her . Her visit had been only a slight distraction for them , even a vexation , perhaps . She grew aware that someone was watching her , and looked up to see an old man staring at her idly . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked ! A character actor ? One of those familiarnameless faces she had seen a dozen times  --  the Duke , my Lord , is in the hands of the French . She smiled at him and he bowed . In a hotel lobby on Central Park West , she found a phone booth . She dialed Francis ' office . There was no one there today , of course . She had n't indulged her little vice in a long while . Once again , by electronic extension , she moved among the batteredfile cabinets , the piles of books , beneath the meringue ceiling . She let the phone ring a long time . Then she called Charlie Russel 's number . A child answered . She had a sudden wistful memory of the Russel children years ago , small , profane , and brown , during a summer 's visit to Flynders . " Is this Stuart ? " she asked . " This is Sophie . "  --  Okay , " said the boy . " You want my mother ? " , , yes .  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breathed into the phone . " Wait a minute . " " Yes , " said Ruth.  | " This is Sophie . " " Yes . " " How are you , Ruth ? " " Extremely well . " " I called because of all the trouble . I 'm sorry about it . " " What trouble ? What are you sorry about ? " " Charlie and Otto . . . the end of all that . " " I would n't call it trouble . " Sophie tightened her hand around the receiver . " How are the children ? " " The children are fabulous . " " Stuart sounded so grown up . " " He is grown up . Fantastic . He 's going back to that tennis camp this summer . It 's incredible how his self-image improved . It 's a very serious camp . I mean , the director knows what tennis is all about . Three hours on the court , then an hour of constructivecriticism . " " And Bobby ? Linda ? " " Bobby is going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of course . " " Linda ? " whispered Sophie . " Marvelous ! She certainly knows who she is . " " Ruth ? I feel terrible about the breakup . " There was a long silence . " They 'll be better off , " Ruth said at last . " I 've always thought there was something odd about their dependence on each other . They 're big boys now , you know , Sophie . . . must n't let them be babies . It castrates men . " " And you ? Are you extremely well ? " There was a click ; the operator asked for another dime . " Could n't we have lunch ? " Sophie said . " I 'm on a diet . I do n't eat lunch any more , " Ruth said . And then she said  --  or did she ?  --  Sophie was n't sure what she 'd really heard but it sounded like , " Go away , Sophie . " In any case , the phone went dead and she did n't have another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the phone and called their doctor . He would not be in the office until Tuesday at ten thirty . The answering service had no suggestion to make . She could leave her number , of course , and if it was an emergency . . . Sophie got out the Yellow Pages and phoned six doctors within the area . None was available . One woman suggestedshe call a policeman . She poured herself a large drink of whisky and drank it down . Then she went to the back door . The gray cat was hunched up on the lip of the stone threshold , its head at an angle , asleep . When Otto came home , he discovered Sophie off in a corner of the living room , sitting in a formal chair no one ever sat in , stippled with light and shadow . Her silence and the dining room table set for dinner , which he glimpsed through the living room doors , looked like a set piece arranged for some purpose that had subsequently been forgotten . He had the impression she was weeping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forlorn scene had been contrived for his benefit , a domesticlesson that was to elicit from him an apology . He spoke brusquely . " Why are you sitting there like an orphan ? " She held up a book . " There 's a little note in your handwriting in the margin . You must have written it a long time ago . The ink has faded and your handwriting looks somewhat different . But I recognized it . It reminded me of how serious you are . It says limitation of liability by statute . ' Here . Claire returned it . " She got up and came to him , switching on lamps as she moved , and put the book in his hand . She was not crying , the dining room table was set for two , not part of a set , only a detail of their routine . He considered what he thought he had seen , an outsider 's view of their life form , inaccurately judged perhaps , but for a second he had not been enmeshed in it , had not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room , " he said.  | " If you like , " she said indifferently . " How was Claire ? " " As always , " she replied . " Leon Fischer was there  --  you remember him ? Her husband long ago ? " " I remember him , that yellow-skinned man who does n't lis-ten . " " Otto ? The cat is back . . . at the door . " " The cat ! " He ran through the living room into the dining room , toward the back door . " Do n't open it , " she called out . " Please do n't . " At Otto 's thundering approach , the cat stretched and eagerly pressed its face against the glass . " I 'll have to open it , " he shouted , and cursed the elaborate sequenceof steps needed to unlock the door  --  hook , key , insert , reach , turn again . The cat yawned and observed him , until he drew back his foot to kick it . Then it whirled away , down the steps , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , after dinner , we 'll go to the hospital . " He turned quickly to her . " We 'll go now , " he said angrily , apprehensively . " No . After we 've eaten . " " Then it has gotten worse ? " " Not worse . But no better . I thought it had this morning . " She appeared calm , resigned , yet her voice was thin , splintery , as though she were barely trying to conceal inner breakage . He put his hand on her arm . She drew away from him . " It 's only a bite , " she said . " You 're so worried . " They ate from trays in the living room . Otto was afraid of spilling food on the Goum rug and he had to bend over too far to reach his plate . The room felt faintly hostile , as though it resentedthis misuse of its given function . Otto felt an obscure anger at the ineluctable force of custom . Why the hell could n't he eat off the floor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a viola/tion of his own sense of fitness that was making him irritable . " It was a silly idea , " he conceded reluctantly . " I guess ... " " I do n't know what I had in mind . " She laughed shortly , two sharp notes like prongs . " What 's funny ? " " Nothing . Did you see Charlie ? " " I saw his tracks . He spilled a carton of coffee on the rug in his office while he was packing up some books . " He looked at her intently , as though trying to gauge her receptivity to what he was about to say , then he set down his tray . " I wonder what you really talked about with him . " The mild , speculative tone in which he asked the question suggested that he did n't expect an answer . " He was drunk and foolish and talked about himself . He was complaining , really , about everything . Ruth , his children  --  " " How did we arrive at such a place , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sophie thought he meant the living room , that his impulse to eat here had been an aberration against which he was now protesting . But then he banged his tray down on the coffee table , and went on talking vehemently , his restless glance lighting on her , the floor , the books . His hands were tightly clasped in his lap . " We agreed , " he said . " We agreed it would be best to dissolve the partnership . We were reasonable . Even Charlie was that .. . we had a meeting . . . discussed procedures . The next day , the very next morning , this rancor appeared , these recriminations against me began . It was like retribution , as though he were punishing me . It had n't been my idea to end the thing . Charlie was the one who was radical about it . I knew there were difficulties . You know I knew that ! There always are . And I know it 's a failure of something in me , that I ca n't feel more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I care about justice . . . I care . But Charlie was at me . He said hep96could tell by the way I looked at them , that I had contempt for his clients . My God ! It was Charlie I had contempt for . " " Why ? " " Because he does n't mean it , " he cried passionately . " Because he wants to be caught up by something , to be swallowed so as not to think about anything . And the giveaway is what he 's trying to do to me ! " " What is it he 's doing ? " she cried . " The way he informs clients about the break . . . the way he behaves toward me in front of the office staff . A man called me last week , someone I 've represented for years . I 'd given some business of his to Charlie , not complicated , but tedious in a routineway . I had too much on my own desk at the time . Charlie took it , willingly I thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told him , oh , very circumspectly , that I was putting the work in on the money clients , where the big fees are , and that he suspected I was having personal trouble because I was neglectingso much routine in the office , that I was allowing the secretariesto handle technical matters that , of course , I would never let them near , as he well knows , and that Charlie thought I 'd been very abstracted this last year  --  he even implied it might be something medical  --  " " But you should have gone right to Charlie , called him on it ! " " You do n't understand . He was indirect , and then the client was so nervous that I only realized later when I was thinking it over , something about the conversation puzzled me , what Charliehad been up to . This client wants to stay with me . But Charliehad made him feel uneasy . It 's very effective , making people uneasy . They feel something is wrong and want a change even if it goes against their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everyone , but it 's been so ambiguous that I did n't know how to catch him out . " " But if he said you were actually sick ? "  | " He did n't , though . He buries it in general conversation , not the business end , but the social part . . . you know . For example , he told someone he 'd been trying to lose weight , then remarked that I had lost a good deal without dieting . In fact , I was gaunt , he said , and he wished he could be . About money , he simply talked about taxes , and said he and I were both concerned about the accountant we 'd been using for years . Oh , why was that ? Well , Charlie said , the office was taking in a somewhatdifferent kind of client these last two years . Do you see ? Vague suggestions , just enough to make people wonder . That poor man who called me last week did n't even know what Charlie had planted in him . It took me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the switchboard , to extract it all from him . It was that business about me being gaunt  --  so arbitrary , but so convincing . He overreached himself there . He 's subtle , prides himself on it , then he becomes suddenly stupid , gets carriedaway by his own cleverness . " " You should have gone and knocked him down , " she said angrily . " You let him get away with it ! " " I ca n't do that , " he said . " Why ca n't you ! " " I 'm too old to pretend that changes anything . " " But are n't you angry ? How can you not be angry ? " " I 'm not , " he said , and sighed . " I 'm not angry . But I ca n't live this way . . . suspecting everyone . " " You mean me . " " I want him out of the office . He 's shit on our friendship , our hard work , our history together . " " Did you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . I just wondered what you and he talked about . " She looked at him defiantly . " He said you were cold andlooked down at his clients , his black sharecroppers ' he calledthem . He said he loved you and you treated him like a deliveryp98boy . I did n't defend you the way I should have . I do n't know why I did n't . Maybe because I 've known him so long and the whole thing was peculiarly domestic  --  like one brother complainingabout another . " " Was that it ? " he asked , his eyes fixed on hers . She turned her head quickly . At that moment , the doorbell rang . It was too late in the day for Jehovah 's Witnesses . They both stood up as the bell rang again , a prolonged , demanding ring . How apprehensivethey both were , she thought , like people waiting for bad news . " I 'll go , " he said . The door opened to an explosion of babble . A man 's voice rose and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , followed by a young Negro man waving his hands . His head was cocked at so extreme an angle that it was a wonder the leopard pillbox hat he was wearing did n't fall off . A brilliant red shawl , tied through the shoulder loop of his army shirt , trailed on the floor behind him . Robbery and murder appeared before her in two short scenes , clicked on and off like pictures projected on a screen. " ... just want to use your phone , man . Like everyone around here thinks black men are killers ! My God ! They been pushing me down their stoops . I got this telegram , I tried to explain to the people , and my roommate and I got no phone , that my mother 's had a stroke . She lives upstate New York and I 've got to get up there . I 've got to phone the station , find out when the train leaves . I never seen such inhospitable cats , you know ? Man , I 'm in trouble and no one wants to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just live down a few blocks from here and I ca n't get to no phone in time ! Mrs. Villela closed her bodega early tonightand she always lets me use the phone . You know Mrs. Villela ? So , please  --  " " Yes , yes , " Otto said . " Use the phone . Take it easy . It 's in here . "  |p99Both  men disappeared . A minute or so later , Sophie heard the Negro asking for train times and the price of the fare in the same high monotone of panic and demand . After a short silence , she heard whispering . The Negro appeared suddenly in the hall in front of the living room . With an elaborate gesture , he snatched off his hat , smiled violently at her and nodded his head rapidly . " You got a decent man there , ma'am . A decent man . Oh , I thank you both for this . There 's some people in the world that 's not crazy , and I thank you and your good husband for that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his turn . Otto glanced hastily in at her and followed the man to the door . " Decent ! " she heard him cry again . " A decent man ... " Looking flustered , Otto came back to the living room , a piece of brown paper in his hand . " I gave him $11 , " he said . " I should n't have done that . He said he needed the fare and was temporarily short . He did call Grand Central . I even heard the dispatcher 's voice . He said he 'd return it to me as soon as he got back and could collect himself . Look . He wrote his address down here . " They both peered at the piece of paper , torn from a grocery sack . " I ca n't read it , " Otto said . " It says Arthur Weinstein , " she said . " But I ca n't read the street name . Did he say that was his name ? " " His roommate 's , " Otto said . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guess . " " Maybe he thought it would n't count , " she said . " I would n't say that , " he said sardonically . " I would say he 's extremely resourceful . " " But his story might be true . " " I do n't believe it . " " But it 's not so strange a story , Otto . It 's ordinary . And what if it was n't true ? What is $11 ? "  | " You mean , they are not to be held accountable ? " " I did n't mean that . I meant , when you give someone something , give it . " " He could n't have done better if he 'd held a gun in his hands . " " He could have done a lot better . Oh , what do you care ! " " It embarrassed me , for both our sakes , his and mine . But it was a good invention . . . because it was so ordinary . He even had a place picked out to ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lying ? ' ' " My prejudices , I suppose , " Otto said . She went upstairs to get her purse and change her shoes . She was n't thinking about anything now except the hospital.  |p101At  the hospital information desk , a powdery old clerk told them to go back to the street and walk around to the emergency-room entrance a block away . There was no access from here , she said . She had the spurious helpfulness of an airline stewardess . Her smile did not conceal from Sophie her judgment : emergency cases belonged to a low social order in the hierarchy of disease . They left the reception room quickly , both of them unpleasantly aware of the special claustrophobic warmth that seems to be the natural climate of illness . The night was smoky and damp ; they walked through mist that was like sweat on an invisible surface . At the door of the emergency room , a policeman stood on one leg , his other foot pressed back against the brick wall , his face devoid of expression . They pushed open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the end of which was a high desk like a cashier 's stand in a restaurant . Behind it sat a man who was engaged in looking importantly at some papers on a clipboard . Just to his rear was the entrance to a waiting room . Although he did not look up as they approached , it was clear he knew of their presence . His head began a small reluctant lateral movement until , at last , with a resigned sigh , he faced them directly . He had a pencil mustache and a repellent patchy hairline , bare in one place , thick outcrops of hair in another . " Yes ? " he said . " Name ? " Before either Sophie or Otto could answer , the desk phone rang . The man picked it up and began a long indolent conversadonwith God knows who  --  marked by frequent bursts of laughter which caused his upper lip to disappear and broughtp102the black line of his mustache hairs to just over his small teeth . The Bentwoods stood with their chins at the edge of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Otto , she wondered if she , too , looked so reduced in size . He put down the phone at last . " Name ! " he demanded crossly , as if they should have answered hours before . Otto gave their name , address , and telephone number in tones of aristocraticchilliness , but when the man asked if they had medical insurance , Otto attacked his pockets brutally as if he were mugging himself . He finally produced the little card with its numbered categories . " Now , " said the man , looking up from the form in which he had been writing down Bentwood particulars . " What 's the trou-ble ? " " A cat bit me , " Sophie replied . " Ah ha ! " snapped the man . " And where did this cat bite you ? " " The hand . " " Which hand ? " he asked with elaborate patience . " Left hand . " " When ? " " Friday . " " Friday ! You mean it bit you Friday ? " " Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sit in the waiting room . You 'll be called . " He picked up his phone again , and Otto and Sophie went limply into the waiting room . It was like a bus station , an abandoned lot , the aisles in the coaches of the old B. &; O. trains , subway platforms , police stations . It combined the transient quality , the disheveled atmosphereof a public terminal with the immediately apprehended terror of a way station to disaster . It was a dead hole , smelling of synthetic leather and disinfectant , both of which odors seemed to emanate from the tornp103scratched material of the seats that lined three walls . It smelled of the tobacco ashes which had flooded the two standing metal ashtrays . On the chromium lip of one , a cigar butt gleamed wetly like a chewed piece of beef . There was the smell of peanut shells , smothering and faintly like a urinal , the smell of sweat from armpits and groins and backs and faces , pouring out and drying up in the lifeless air , the smell of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the warm sweetish air , picking at the nostrils like thorns  --  all the exudations of human flesh , a bouquet of animal being , flowing out , drying up , but leaving a peculiar and ineradicableodor of despair in the room as though chemistry was transformed into spirit , an ascension of a kind . Against the fourth wall stood a long rickety table on which lay a few torn magazines . The pages of one fluttered in a blast of heat which came from the vent of a metal box which was suspendedfrom the ceiling . Light issuing from spotlights in the ceiling was sour and blinding like sick breath . There was in that room an underlying confusion in the functionof the senses . Smell became color , color became smell . Mute stared at mute so intently they might have been listening with their eyes , and hearing grew preternaturally acute , yet waited only for the familiar syllables of surnames . Taste died , mouths opened in the negative drowsiness of waiting . Two children lay asleep on the seats . Their father , his head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife huddled next to him , her small head tied up in a scarf , her legs , covered with black hairs , not quite touching the floor . She was small and dark and knobby , and looked so uneasy she appeared to be the only person in the room who had taken shelter in it  --  as though she had come from an even more dismaying place . Next to her , three men sat squeezed together , each wearing a short-brimmed black . hat . The middle one had his arm in a crude sling and hep104kept his glance on the wall clock , watching the second hand fixedly as it swept around and around . Across from the three was an elderly well-dressed woman with a heavily bandaged leg . She played distractedly with the curved handle of a black cane and once she banged it against one of the standing ashtrays . The groaning man snapped his head forward , clutched his belly and glowered at her . The old woman tightened her scalloped mouth and very gently , but deliberately , tapped the ashtray again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I 'll go to Noel on Tuesday . It wo n't make any difference now . There 's no need for us to sit here . " Otto grabbed her upper arm and squeezed it violently . " Put up with it ! " he demanded through gritted teeth . " Put up with it ! " he repeated . " Everyone else does . " An hour later , perhaps two , the children were awakened by their mother when she tried to accompany her husband into the treatment room . Her husband , letting go of his belly for a minute , shoved her back on the bench . The older child giggled and punched her brother in the neck . He began to cry noisily and the woman held her jaw as though she had a toothache . Then she stood up again . The man spoke to her rapidly in Spanish while the nurse who had come to get him watched with murderouspatience . Only Sophie looked up at the weeping child , the man , beginning to shout now , the stubborn figure of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their eyes from the scene ; their attention continued to rest upon the second hand of the clock , the black cane , the magazine pages riffled by the hot air from the vent . At last the woman sank back on the bench . The boy put his head on her lap , wiping his nose with her skirt . Soon , the man returned , waving a piece of paper , a bullying look of cheerfulnesson his face . The woman with the cane was summoned , and eventually limped back through the waiting room on her way out , a new bandage around her leg . The three men remained , si/lent , expressionless , looking like extras on a set , hired and then forgotten . " What if someone were bleeding to death ? " whispered Sophie . Otto did n't answer . He had fallen asleep , his chin sunk in his collar . " Mrs. Bentwood ! " the nurse said from the door . Otto sprang to his feet . Perhaps he had not been asleep , Sophie thought , but had pretended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't bear another word from her . " You need n't go , " she said . " Come on ! " he said and grabbed her arm . The treatment room was divided into compartments by white curtains moved on runners . In the center of the room was a large U-shaped counter which held charts , bottles , retorts , severaltelephones and a small dented coffeepot . There were several patients in the room , who must have been there a long time . An old woman was soaking her hand in a washbasin of sudsy liquid , staring straight ahead and biting her lower lip . The thin white hairs on each side of her forehead rose and fell as two nurses walked back and forth quickly in front of her . A man with a bloody gash in his leg was staring at it , as was a darkskinnedyoung doctor , who might have been a West Indian . Leaning against a radiator , his jacket unbuttoned , a toothless hospital guard was talking and grinning teasingly at a nurse as she prepared a hypodermic . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disappeared behind a curtain . Orderliesmoved indifferently around them . But after the desolation of the waiting room , this room had a powerful atmosphere of welcome . Here was conversation , work , solutions . A Negro attendant , a stocky man with a square head , darkamberskin , and small bright eyes gleaming out of a network of red veins , walked up to Sophie and stared at her thoughtfully . " All right , honey , " he said . " Now . You the one got bit by the cat , right ? Now show it to me , honey . "  |p106As  she held out her hand , the man with the gash in his leg emitted a short rusty scream as though he 'd realized only that minute he was justified in crying out . " No , no . . . " said the doctor softly . " I 'm not gon na take that hand away from you , " the Negro said coaxingly . She felt that old-time reassurance that she had once thought the natural property of dark people  --  as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her hand arrestedmidway between them , she looked intently at him , perceivingfor a second the existence of a world of unknown opinionabout herself , her clothes and skin and odor . Then she thrust her hand at him . " Oh , yeah , " he said reflectively . " I see it . " A nurse with a face that looked as if it had been drawn by a child with a pink crayon , peered over the Negro 's shoulder at Sophie 's hand , then said something to an orderly who was standing next to the counter . He reached for the telephone and dialed a number . " We 've got to report it , you know , " said the nurse . " Report it ? " Otto echoed . The alarm in his voice extended Sophie 's own , and she moved uneasily away from him . " What do you mean ? " she asked the nurse sharply . " To the police . Of course we have to report it . All animal bites have to be . " She shook her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ report it . " " What 's her name ? " asked the orderly impatiently . The nurse picked up a piece of paper . " Mrs. Sophie Bentwood , " she replied , spelling out the name and giving the address . Then she turned back to Sophie . " Now , when did this happen ? " " Yesterday . " " Yesterday ? Why did n't you come in then ! Yesterday ! " " I did n't think it was necessary . "  | " Oh , were you wrong ! " said the nurse . " Roll up your sleeve , dear , " said the Negro . " What for ? " asked Sophie , childish , paranoid , ashamed . " A little tetanus , honey . Just roll up your sleeve , dear , and the nurse will take care of it . " He waited patiently until she had done what he 'd told her to do and then went over to the old woman , whose face softened into hopefulness at his approach . Another nurse , jolly , sloppy-mouthed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ counter like an exhibit . " Guess it 's not the best time to ask , but you would n't like a kitten , would you ? A lovely Persian kitten ? A friend of mine 's cat had three and she 's got one left . " The guard laughed . " She do n't want no cat right now , " he said . At that moment , a bed was wheeled past by an orderly ; on it lay a small black man , doubled up , his cheek resting on his hand , his eyes wide open and glassy . Another orderly sprang to the doors and pushed them open and the bed shot through into the corridor . " Relax ! " said a nurse in Sophie 's ear . It was a fast shot and she did n't feel it . She breathed deeply , flushed . It was over  --  she was out of it . " You 'll have to have the shots , " said the nurse . She had put the syringe down on the counter and was leaning toward Sophie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a gamy private smell that seemed to emanate from the nurse 's tightly curled ginger-colored hair . The nightmare of her expectation shriveled into hard realization . She glanced at Otto ; the pity in his face belonged to the moment before she had heard the news . It was of no use to her now . " You get them at the Board of Health , " said the nurse . " All you have to do is go there and they 'll take care of it . " Everyone was watching her openly . She felt their expectation as a kind of leaning forward  --  the way a cluster of people will lean overp108someone who has been in an accident . Then the nurse smiled and touched her lightly on the shoulder . The other people , the guard , the orderlies , went back to whatever they were doing . " I had them myself , " the nurse said . " Take it easy . They are n't so bad . " " Not bad ? " said Sophie loudly . " Oh , come on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Oh , they do n't do it that way now , " the nurse said . " You get them in your arm . I 'm not kidding you . They really are n't bad . " " Was it a cat ? " asked Sophie distractedly . She was sure the nurse had lied about the shots . " You can roll your sleeve down now . No , it was n't a cat . I was going home one night and ran into a pack of dogs . One of them bit me . It was n't a bad bite but it broke the skin . It was pretty dark where it happened so I could n't see the dogs enough to know which one had done it . Not that I was in the mood to go chase them . " " But the cat is n't sick . I know it is n't sick . " " You ca n't tell by looking , " said the nurse , and her voice had altered . The note of sympathy was gone . She had felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obligated to deal with . " We 'll be able to catch the cat , " Otto said . " Oh , well ! " the nurse said . " That 's a different story . If you catch it , all you have to do is to take it to the A.S.P.C.A. They 'll examine it and give the results to the police . You wo n't have to do a thing , not even lift a telephone . " The dark-skinned doctor was standing at the counter looking at her . He shook his head very faintly . " You 'd better have an antibiotic , " he said , and began to write out a prescription . " They really are n't bad , then ? " Sophie asked the nurse appeasingly , thinking to herself , I have no pride , no resources , no religion , nothing  --  why do n't I shut up ? Why do n't I shut up !  | " It 's boring , " said the nurse . " You have to go there every day for a couple of weeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the disease is so horrible ! I never saw anybody had it but I read up on it after what happened to me . Naturally , I was interested . " She turned away and began to read a chart . The Bentwoods were being dismissed . Across from them , the Negro attendant was bending over the old woman . " Let 's see your hand , dear . Let 's just see it . I wo n't take it away from you . Ah , that 's a good girl . Oh , better . Much better ! " There was a loud buzz , suddenly strangled , and a yellow light flashed in one of three bulbs attached to the wall . " Yellow alert ! " said the guard , watching the flashing light . " What 's that ? " Sophie asked of the attendant who was about to open the door for her . " Someone 's passed away , " he said . " Dead , " said Sophie . " Maybe , " he said . " They call it here cardiac arrest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they call it . And when they hear that buzzer , they run for the patient , throw him on the floor and pound him , make sure he 's dead , then if he 's not , they 've got their ways of starting things up again . " He seemed about to laugh , then glanced over his shoulder at the old woman and darted off to her again . She was sitting motionless , her hand in her lap . He picked it up , soapy and lifeless-looking in his dark hand . Otto went through the door but Sophie paused , looking back . " Let 's not horse around , dear , " said the attendant to the old woman , and he plunged her hand into the sudsy water . " We 're going to get the cat , " Otto said as they got into the car . " Do n't worry any more . I 'm glad you got the shot . That 's all there 's going to be . " " Did you ever know that ? That when someone dies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "  | " I never thought about it . " " My father told me that in France , in the villages , the church bell is tolled when someone dies . " " That 's kinder , " he said , then added somewhat sardonically , " it puts a little romance into death . " " Oh , Otto ! " she cried . " I 'll have to have those shots ! " " No , you wo n't . " " The nurse had them . Why should n't I ? I 'm so ashamed to make this fuss , this noise . " " It 's all right . Make all the noise you want . If it helps . But you 've got to draw a line . This is just a medical procedure . You 're not in danger . . . it 's only an incident . Not death . You do n't draw enough lines . " " Why am I like that ? " she asked sadly . " I do n't know . . . perhaps you 'd have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " How will we catch that animal ? " " It 'll come back for food . " " It 's a good thing I fed it , after all . Otherwise we would n't be able to lure it back with food . " She managed a pale smile , lost somewhere in the car 's upholstery . He must have sensed the smile . He laughed with relief . " There 's a lot to be said for logic , " he said . " Even when it 's lu-natic . " They found a drugstore open on Atlantic Avenue . Several depressed-lookingpeople stood around waiting while the two pharmacists performed behind a glass partition . The deadly overhead light fell upon the usual assortment of drugstore perquisites . " Where 's your Medicaid I.D. ? " asked a middle-aged druggist brusquely of a man who stood dreamily in front of the counter . The man started . He looked bewildered , as though awakened for brutal reasons . " You know I ca n't fill this , " the druggist said , handing a slipp111of paper back over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your I.D . What 's the matter ? You have n't got it ? " The man did n't move . He appeared unable to summon up the words , an explanation to deal with opposition , but there was in his stance a vague determination to oppose the vagaries of official procedure if only with his continued presence . The druggistmade an impatient sound and looked around him to the Bentwoods . " Yes ? " Otto handed over the prescription . The man with the missing I.D . did n't move . Then , just as Sophie 's capsules were handed over to her , the man walked resolutelyto the door . He dropped his own prescription on the floor . " Shit , shit , shit . . . " he said without emphasis , even , it seemed , without anger . " They 'll have to kill the cat , wo n't they ? " Sophie asked Otto , as they drew up in front of the house . " I think so , " Otto said . " But I do n't know much about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I 've killed the cat , " she said . " We have n't caught it yet , " he said.  | " Tomorrow , I 'll take you to Flynders , " Otto promised . " It 's going to be a nice day . I think it 's only a kind of spring mist tonight . We 'll leave early and we can have lunch at the inn in Quogue . We 'll walk around a bit and think about different things . It 'll do you good . " Sophie turned on a lamp . " If it comes back ... " " It will . " " I may have frightened it away for good , " she said , going to the back door . " Because it attacked you ? " " Well  --  it knew something happened . " " All in a day 's scrounging , for a wild thing like that . It does n't know anything except where food is . " She peered through the door . The yard was in darkness except for a streak of light from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surface of a fence . Otto came in from the kitchen holding a bowl . " Look . The chicken livers . If they do n't bring it back . . . Do we have a box somewhere ? A good strong carton ? " " We must . You 're avvays saving everything . " " Go look upstairs , will you ? I 'll put the bowl outside . " " Do n't do that , Otto . Some other cat will come and steal off with the livers . " She looked at him as he stood before her with the bowl held out in his hands like an offering . He was utterly absorbed in an intention she thought preposterous . Perhaps it was the nature of that intention itself that made her see them both as fools . How quickly the husk of adult life , its importance ,  |p113was  shattered by the thrust of what was , all at once , real and imperativeand absurd . " Not a chance , " he said , " because I 'm going to stay here and keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bowl just below the ledge , then went and got a chair and his briefcase from the living room . Full of his plan , he smiled at her confidentlyand unwrapped a cigar . Perhaps he was right , right to be the way he was . " I 'm ready , " he said . " Get the box , Sophie . Go on , now ... " By eleven , the cat had not appeared . Otto brought the bowl of livers inside and set it down next to the cardboard box Sophie had found in the storage closet . He moved purposefully , as though to show her that everything was going along according to plan . " It 'll be back in the morning , " he said firmly . " For God 's sake  --  be a little uncertain ! " He ignored her . He went to empty his cigar ashes in the kitchen , returned the chair to the living room and checked the front door . " We should leave at nine . We can be in Flynders by noon . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she said . He glanced at her . " Your eyes are red . Better not read to-night . " " I ca n't , anyhow . " " I 'm going to turn off the lights in the kitchen . " While he was gone , the gray cat appeared . " Otto ! " He ran back to the dining room . " Do n't open the door yet . Wait . . . I 've got to get the livers in the box . Wait a minute . " " You 've got to leave one out so he can smell it . " " Look out ! I 'm going to open the door . " " Put it on the ledge . . . . " " I know what to do . Ready ? " " Not yet . " She ran to the coat closet and fetched back two pairs of Otto 's gloves . Rather self-consciously , she gave him thep114new sheepskin ones , putting her hands into his old chamois pair . " I 've been bitten , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tail switching slightly . " Now ! " she said . He opened the door . The cat mewled delicately . Otto dropped a chicken liver on the porch . It hit the cat 's back , then slid off . The animal ate it quickly , frantically , grunting with pleasure , then looked up for more . " On the ledge , on the ledge . . . " she whispered hastily . He dropped the bit of meat . The cat hooked it with one claw , tore it from its own paw with another , gulped , and circled agitatedlyjust at the brink of the door . " The bowl ! " " Will you shut up ! " he hissed at her . He held the bowl a foot from the floor . The cat slid over the ledge ; its two front feet were on the dining room floor , its head swayed back and forth as it sniffed the air . Sophie shuddered deeply . Otto kept the bowl just out of the animal 's reach . The gray length stretched . Otto lowered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , crooning to it . " See , see , here it is , come , here it is .... " With a rat 's rapid , flat-eyed look , the cat came the rest of the way into the room . The Bentwoods waited . The cat rubbed its body against the box , clawed it savagely , mewled piteously . Then it began to really work on it  --  standing up , dropping to its feet , shoving itselfagainst the cardboard surface . Its head turned restlessly and nervously . It seemed unaware of the Bentwoods , who stood motionlessa few feet away . Quite suddenly , just as Sophie was wondering how they 'd ever get it outside , now that it was loose in the house , the cat leaped into the box . " Quick ! " shouted Otto . They turned over the flaps . " Hold it , hold it , " cried Sophie . " Oh , God ! I ca n't . . . it 's pressing up against  --  " The box shook violently . Otto , with one free hand , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a thud after each turn . The cat screamed . A smell filled their nostrils , acrid , vicious , nauseating . " Fear , " Otto whispered . They stared at each other across the box as they both squatted there in front of the door . Then Otto tied a knot in the heavy line . It was done . The animal had grown silent . Only the smell of its terror still hung in the air all around them . Sophie breathed shallowly . " Leave the door open , " Otto said . He carried the box to the front door , then put on his coat . She got hers . " No , " he said . " You 're not coming . It 's not far . For crissakes , go to bed , do n't think about anything . " She watched through the window as Otto walked to the car , carrying the box . He put it down on the sidewalk , opened the rear door of the car and shoved in the box . Even from where she was standing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mist . But she knew it was not the mist . The cat 's body had opened up as though it had been smashed , and it had beshit itself . She looked at her left hand . The swelling had gone down . On the dining room table , she found the package that containedher medicine . She swallowed down the capsule with Scotch . When Otto returned an hour later , he found her sitting in an ostrich-sized nest in bed . She had contrived it all with pillows and magazines and books . He began to laugh . " What are you ready for ? " " Diverting myself , " she said . " And it does n't work . " " The night man at the A.S.P.C.A. said there had n't been a case of rabies around here in thirty years . " " What do they do to the cat ? Do they kill it ? " " I do n't know . He took the box away . It was snarling by then , but he did n't seem worried . He just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | " Monday . " " Not till then ? " " The doctor , the one who does the examination , does n't come in until Monday . You do n't have to call them , just as the nurse said . If there 's anything  --  there wo n't be  --  they will telephone you before noon on Monday . It 's really over now . " " But you have n't told me about the cat . " " They do n't have to kill them any more , " he said , then hesitated . He picked up a magazine that had fallen on the floor and dropped it on the bed . " All they need now to determine whether the animal is healthy is a sample of its saliva , apparently . But when he asked me if I wanted the cat back , later , I said no . So he said that they 'll dispose of it . " " Dispose of it ? " " Enough , Sophie . " " All right . " " It was terrible , was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That was terrible . " " I 've got to take my coat downstairs . " " Oh , Otto , leave it on the chair . " " I am tired . " " Did it make any noise in the car ? " " None . Nothing until I handed it over to the man . " He looked irresolutely at his coat . " Oh , I 'll take it down . " " Nothing will happen if you leave it on the chair just thisonce , " she said exasperatedly . He dropped it on the chair . " We were lucky , " he said . " We have all the luck , " she said . Otto always turned off the radiator in the bedroom at the first faint sign of spring and it was chilly now . He shivered as he undressed . Then he stood naked , staring at the bed in perplexity . " What is it ? " she asked . " I 'm hungry and I do n't know what I want . " She made a few suggestions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , come to bed , " and he fell heavily beside her as though he 'd been struck down by a blow . She let the magazinesslide to the floor , then picked up a Balzac novel from her bedside table . But Madame de Bargeton 's ambition and poignantineptitudes did not hold her attention . Her mind slid away from the page . Otto was asleep beside her . She sat up against her pillows for a long time , wondering what thing it was she was thinking about just beneath the feigned attention she was giving to those random topics that now drifted through her mind . Deliberately , she visualized the living room of their Flynders farmhouse , then , blurring that bright familiar place , another room began to form : the skimpy parlor of her childhood , her fatherand a friend speaking late into the evening while she lay drowsily on the Victorian sofa , listening to the drone of the men 's low voices , feeling on her cheek the sting of a horsehair which had worked its way up through the black upholstery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true grown-up life to come . She put her hand on her cheek and touched the place where the horsehair had pricked , and she gasped at the force of a memorythat could , in the space of a breath taken and released , expungethe distance between sleepy child and exhausted adult , as though , she thought , it had taken all these years to climb the stairs to bed.  |p118At  the last moment , they decided to take a picnic lunch . They could build a fire in the living room at Flynders and eat before their own hearth . The morning did not look promising ; the sky was slack and wet looking . Yet there was a kind of festivity in wrapping sandwichesin waxed paper , in rinsing out the Thermos . A few grains of sand spilled from the straw picnic basket onto the kitchen counter . Sophie had awakened to hope and intensified alarm . The unlikelihoodof the cat 's being rabid had , mysteriously , increased the horror of the possibility that it might be . She moved quickly , packing the food , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the car blanket , a copy of Out of Africa which she would read to Otto on the way out . It was sure to be colder in Flynders than in the city . In Flynders , there was real weather . " You feel better , " Otto announced with evident relief . " Yes . It 's stopped hurting . But I 'm high as a kite , thinking about that phone call  --  " " You ca n't be worried about that ! " " There is a possibility . " " It 's a formality , not a possibility . " " I found your keys on the couch . You must have dropped them there last night . " " Take your pill . " They drove through miles of Queens , where factories , warehouses , and gas stations squeezed up against two-story , two-familyhouses so mean and shabby that , by contrast , the ranks of uniform and tidy tombstones rising from cemetery islets thatp119thrust up among the dwellings seemed to offer a more humane future . Sidewalks , brutal slabs of cracked cement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ petered out , and along the center of the tarmac streets , short lengths of old trolley tracks occasionallygleamed among the potholes . Here and there , the skeleton of a vast new apartment complex sat on the rent ground ; tree roots and rocks and earth rolled up around its foundation . Cries of boredom and rage were scrawled across the walls of factories , and among these threats and imprecations , invitations and anatomylessons , the face of an Alabama presidential candidate stared with sooty dead eyes from his campaign posters , claiming this territory as his own . His country , warned the poster  --  vote for him  --  pathology calling tenderly to pathology . There were some churches left , most of them small , of red brick or pocked stucco . But there rose one great baroque Spanishcathedral , its entrance barred by iron gates . It sat in the middleof that crawling , suppurating urban decay like a great chilled eminence , half-dead with its own arrogance . " I wish there was another way to go to Flynders , " Sophie murmured . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll be out of this soon . " " It 's so hopelessly ugly . " " Do n't look at it , " he said quickly . She opened the book on her lap . " I 'm going to need glasses soon , " she said , looking down at the page . " Can you still read the telephone directory without trouble ? " He was not listening to her . He was staring intently through the windshield at the desolate road ahead . " Otto ? " " I was thinking of what Charlie would have said if he 'd heard me tell you not to look . How he would have pounced on that ! What an example of my lack of social conscience ! " " Is your every thought examined in the light of what Charlie would have to say ? "  | " Do you remember years ago , when people liked to quote Thoreau , that line about the quiet desperation of most men 's lives ? One morning , a month or so ago , I went to Charlie 's officeand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at what he had written in block letters on a piece of paper . It was that quote . I asked him , in what I thought was a light tone  --  althoughas you know I 'm not so good at that sort of thing  --  if his life was quietly desperate ? I do n't know . . . the morning was sunny , sunlight on the rug , and it was cold outside and I wanted everything to be all right . . . . He looked at me with absolute hatred . He said that that quote was a prime example of middle-class self-love . And when I said Thoreau had not intendedit as such , he shouted that intention meant nothing , all truth resided in what a thing was used for . There were clients in the waiting room and the lines were jammed with incoming calls . Charlie looked to me like an Irish gorilla , lurching over his desk , about to murder me . I told him he was full of shit . I was stunned by his loathing of me . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to resist as middle-class oppression , because it wears a thousand faces , even the face of revolution , and that it is an insatiable gut that can even nourish itself on the poison its enemies leave lying about to destroy it . I asked him what alternative he had in mind and he buzzed his secretary and told her to send in his appointment . " " But life is desperate , " said Sophie almost inaudibly . " Did you say life is desperate ? " Otto asked , leaning toward her . Then suddenly he began to laugh . " Read to me , " he said again . " Go on . " So as the Mercedes joined the thickening traffic that was making its way east on the highway , Sophie read to Otto about the green hills of Africa . At midmorning , they stopped for coffee , and sat peacefully and silently in the overheated coffee shop until Otto , attempting to open a plastic container of cream , spilled it all over himself.  |p121He  began to curse , making an addition to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worst . He looked more familiar to Sophie than he had for two days , and she realized suddenly that he had been restraining himself since Friday , restraining his character for her sake , as though he had shoved into a closet some disreputable relative whose presencemight shatter her . She wanted to reassure him  --  she was thinking of what to say  --  when he asked her exactly what Charliehad said to her Friday night . He would continue to ask her , she thought , and she would continue to be unable to tell him . She no longer remembered what Charlie had said to her Friday night . " Nothing much about you , except what I 've already told you . " " What he said about me does n't matter . He was up to somethingjust because it was you he was talking to . " It was clearing outside . Through the window , she saw a ray of sunshine widen on the roof of their car and on a filthy red Cadillac parked next to it . She looked around the coffee shop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the counter , middle-aged , plump , overdressed . " What could he be up to with me ? " " Disorder . The creation of disorder . " " You know what you sound like ? A person who has just gottena divorce and is telling himself that his whole married life had been nothing but torment . " Otto sighed . " I suppose so . " They got up , and Otto went to pay the sleepy cashier , who was bathed in sunshine . Sophie passed the middle-aged couple and heard the man say in a fierce mumble , " I.Q. Fuck you ! If he does n't work , who cares how bright he is ! " The woman 's black chamberpot hat seemed to rise slightly above her head . Her mouth snapped shut as though she 'd bitten off a thread . As they passed it on the way to the Mercedes , Sophie glancedp122into the window of the Cadillac and saw , side by side on the front seat , a large box of Kleenex and a sleeping Pekingese . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he backed away from the coffee shop . " Silent and vanished . " " People always seem to have to make a lot of noise when they leave , " she said  --  except for people like me , she thought privately , remembering how submissively and silently she had slunk away from Francis . But then , there was nothing she could have done about it . Yet , for a bitter moment , she was caught up in the old tormenting question : What if Francis had been available ? If the door had swung open , would she have gone through it ? She glanced over at Otto . Francis had not only deprivedher of himself . He had cheated her of her certainty about Otto . " Why does he have to destroy me ? " " Is that what he 's doing ? " He grunted . " No . But I 'm getting bruised . . . people I 've known for years asking my secretary about my health . It disgustsme . " " The clients who stay with you will forget about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people that much . " " If you 're a lawyer , they do . If they 're in trouble , they do . I 'd be better off if I were more like my father . He based his life on the assumption that nothing would come of anything . And hope broke in upon him the way disappointment breaks in on other people 's lives . He hated hope . It unmanned him . Assume the worst , my son , and you 'll never be disappointed . . . . I was in the hospital room when he died . He could n't speak or move , and one side of his face was paralyzed . But he broke through that coma just long enough to give me a lopsided smile . I knew what he meant . See ? See how it all ends ? ' " " We take the next exit . " " I know .... "  |p123They  drove around a cloverleaf and then onto another parkway . " We 're not far now , " Otto said cheerfully . " We 'll be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with money . Two people I 'd counted on have gone with Charlie . There was an exchange of sorts , though . " He laughed , and continued , " You should see what I got in trade . I could have told her she 'd better go to someone else because I did n't deal with such problems . But she was so damned forlorn . Charlie had neglected her , got bored , I suppose  --  Charlie gets bored easily  --  and I decided I 'd take her on , just to prove I could , I guess . " " Who ? " " Mrs. Cynthia Kornfeld . She arrived at the office with a fracturedindex finger and eighteen stitches in her scalp . " He accelerated . For Otto , it was a dramatic opening to a story . It occurredto Sophie that he had been excited at the idea of doing something that went against his usual inclination . He glanced over at her , smiling , gauging the effect of his words , perhaps . She laughed back and told him to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should n't say that , it 's the wrong approach  --  namedAbe Kornfeld . Two years ago , he struck it rich . What he had done was to buy up a dozen used typewriters from one of those stores on Canal Street . Then he took them apart and reassembled them in some mangled way and arranged the keyboards so that they spelled out mystic nonsense words . A gallerygave him a show . He got $2,000 for a standard and $1,000 for a portable . That was his first show . He developed categories which allowed him to charge considerably more  --  a standard Royal , for example , was a lot more than a standard Smith-Corona , but a portable with Japanese characters was worth more than both of them . They 'd been living in a floor-through flat on Hudson Street for fifteen years . He turned one room into a factory , and she gave up her substitute teaching she 'd been sup/porting him while he was a painter  --  and they began to turn out these things at an extraordinary rate , said it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do it myself , and still they could n't keep up with orders . She was stunned by the money that poured in  --  and scared . She said she felt it was just another novelty and would drop out of sight as soon as something else came along . But he said it was a breakthrough , that the destruction of a typewriterand its reconstitution , its humanization , as a kind of oracle , was a direct blow at American Philistinism . He broke up his old easel and threw it out on the street , and he tore up all his former work . He began to buy things . A Piaget watch , for example . He removed both hands from it and told her he would n't be corrupted by his good fortune if he indulged his taste for luxurious objects but always deformed them enough to ruin their function . The evening he beat her up , he began by arrivinghome late , just after she 'd put the child to bed . She was doing most of the work on the typewriters by then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the days . He was carrying a copy of Mein Kam p f that night . When she complained that she was tired and they 'd have to get some Chinese food or a pizza for supper , he threw the book at her , then said she could n't deny that Hitler had had a lot of style . Then he told her that they were having a dinner party . He had already ordered Senegalese food from some joint in the Village , and had invited all the people to whom he had ever owed money . Should she make coffee and a dessert ? she asked . He did n't care what she made as long as it was n't square . She felt something special was required , but she had nothing in the house except several boxes of strawberry Jell-O . She cooked them up and poured them into the biggest bowl she had . Then , instead of bits of fruit , she dropped in nickelsand dimes . Whether she was celebrating their new affluence , or making an ironic comment , I do n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capable of much irony . When she brought in the dessert , she was applauded by the guests , but Abep125flung himself at her and had to be restrained by two painters beforehe did her serious harm . I guess he must have been sore at her horning in with a joke of her own . " " Is that all ? Is that what she wants to divorce him for ? " " She says he will beat her again . And he 's been getting ugly with the child , too . Everything has changed in a way that makes it impossible for it to change back . She speaks very slowly and flatly and with absolute conviction . " " And what does he say ? " " Nothing . He 's disappeared . " " No one knows where ? The gallery ? Friends ? " " No one . " " Does that frighten her ? He sounds crazy . Maybe he had an accident . " " She is one of those people with remarkable patience , but a terminal point beyond which they never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was doing , and never questionedhim . Now , she behaves as if she would n't care if he did turn up dead . " " Is she pretty ? " He did n't answer right away . Then he said , " I do n't really know . I 'll look , next time . " " Do n't you look at women ? " she asked slyly . He did n't answer her and she did n't repeat her question . She felt a mild estrangement between them , just a little moment of tension . She thought about it , turning it over in her mind as she might have turned over an object in her hands , trying to understand her own intention , which she knew had been disruptive . Why interrupt the pleasant boredom of the drive ? The sky was all clear now , a bland , washed blue , and the occasional house that could be glimpsed from the road looked freshly painted and prosperous and eternal ; and Sophie thought of the great gray sea of sludge through which they had driven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you thinking about ? " she asked him . " Oh , my father again . When he was in the room , we all watched what we said . You would n't have liked him . He did n't care what people talked about as long as they spoke to the point . And a subject had to be completed before a new one was begun . Thoughts had to be ordered , like boxcars on a track . You could not , when describing a summer in Paris , begin to speak about Istanbul . " " What if you did ? " " He had very prominent knuckles and they would turn white . A change in subject , until he thought it had terminated , offendedsome inner sense of progression . It enraged him . In a similar way , if you were a chemist you could not speak about atonality . You might say you liked it . But no judgments . " " You 're right . I would n't have liked that . " " Here 's our turnoff . " The village of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had a winter population of fewer than one hundred families , most of whom were entirely dependent on the summer people for their income . In the full summer swing of July and August , the population swelled to at least two thousand , and last summer this number had been augmented by a group of New York advertising agency people who had purchased an old estate , torn down the thirty-two-room house and outbuildings , subdivided the acreage , and started to build a group of houses that was supposed , eventually , to resemble a French farming community . As Otto drove past the area , a small sign nailed to an elm trunk announced its name  --  BUDDING GROVE . Sophie saw a sway-backed gray horse standing among the half-built structures . " There 's the architect , " she said . Flynders was on neither the ocean nor the bay so the rents for the old farmhouses that were still available were less than those farther out on the island in the Hamptons . There was no bank ;  |p127one  antique shop managed by an elderly and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an I.G.A . market ; three gas stations ; a post office in a large shed that also housed a laundromat ; a general store ( hardware , stationery , tennis shoes in large sizes ) ; two public telephone booths , and a narrow dark restaurant which was open the year around . Old-time summer people made a ritual stop each year to make sure the restaurant 's permanent exhibit had not been removed from its window  --  a plastic piece of apple pie , on top of which decayed from year to year a yellow scoop of Styrofoam . Once , Flynders had been a town , a center for the neighboring farms . Most of the farmland , abandoned and neglected , had reverted to marsh and had once been a halting place for a myriad of birds . Every summer house had , still , in cupboard or basket or bookcase , worn copies of Roger Tory Peterson 's Field Guide to the Birds . Then the village people had called in the mosquito-controlpeople . Now there were few birds , and poison ivy and Virginia creeper flourished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those trees not already harmed by frequent droughts . But in the center of the village , three copper beeches survived , black in the noonday sun , purple in the twilight . Even the villagersprized them , not so rapturously as the summer people , perhaps . One manor house remained unoccupied and unsold . It sat on a small rise , a menacing , ugly house , a barrow , deposited and deserted by some 1920 's millionaire and left there to testify to the power of money to create a permanent and quarrelsome unloveliness . A few young people lived in Flynders , commuting many miles to work in distant towns . They lived in houses which they had bought , off the highway , green or blue or pink boxes stacked up into rooms over two-car garages , with Venetian blinds at the windows . A real-estate agent in Riverhead handled the Flynders rentals and sales . The Bentwoods ' house , a small Victorian farmhouse sittingp128neatly in the middle of a meadow , was a mile north of the village . Otto had placed around it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neighbors , but because he had been compelled by his sense of order to distinguish between what belonged immediately to the house and what belonged to the open fields . From their porch , they could see the barn Otto had bought , which was two meadows away to the east . The little fence had made Sophie restless and she had begun , two summers before , to plant flowers outside it . She was a good gardener , but not a passionateone . She had not the long patience required for ordering a landscape . When something did not survive the summer , she lost interest in it and would not try again . Otto turned onto their dirt road . The mailbox was lopsided on its wooden post . Ahead of them was the house , its shutters closed , a wicker stool they had forgotten to store , upside down on the porch . The ground was hummocky , denuded-looking , gray . In the summer , the grass was cut by a local man who sold the hay to a stable in Southampton . In one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nest from last summer hung like a tumbleweed . They walked up the brick path , Sophie seeing from the corner of her eye a pair of green cotton gloves half-buriedin the hard soil near where bee balm grew . " I forgot the lunch , " Otto said , and handed her the key to the back door . She looked first into the kitchen window . Sunlight lay on the floor , touching the maple runners of the rocking chair . She felt a wave of pure happiness . The cold inside , the chill of a house empty for many months , had a strange softness to it , faintly suggestive of anesthetic . Sophiewalked slowly toward the counter , noting with pleasure an assortment of kitchen toys , most of which were duplicates of those she had in Brooklyn . She picked up a round tin box and shook it to hear the rattle of the cooky cutters inside , then recalledsuddenly the face of a summer friend of theirs , a painter who had visited them frequently in August . She recalled howp129he had picked up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his face , tracing its shape with his fingers and how , when he arrived , he washed his hands in the kitchen sink , using the yellowkitchen soap . She had liked him very much , liked his substantial , handsome face , the way the skin of his hands had gleamed beneath the water from the tap , the way he 'd nudge things with the unself-conscious and sober curiosity of a child or an especially alert animal . He had , she remembered thinking , a certain kind of self-love , the kind that comes from poverty , perhaps , having nothing else to love . He was very poor , except for ex-wives , of which he had several , and he had many theories of how to manage a life which he described with the calm zealotry of one who has received truths from the sun . He did n't smoke or drink  --  a little peyote now and then  --  and as he sat down to one of Sophie 's dinners , he would groan in mock horror at the dissipation he was about to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he said , and had nearly succeeded in giving up meat and fish . So she had said to him self-consciously that she wished she could give up smoking , but guessed her inability was a " failure of character , " and she had been shocked by his mockerywhen he parroted her voice , making it high and fatuous : " Failure of character , failure of character , " he had chirped and laughed at her . When she 'd quit cigarettes in the fall , she 'd dropped him a note  --  he 'd gone off to spend the winter in some Vermont barn  --  telling him that her character was improving , but he had never answered her . She was thinking of him now , she realized suddenly , because she was staring at what remained of the object he had liked most , a bottle shaped like a bunch of grapes that had held wine vinegar and which was now lying in fragments on the counter and all around it , stains in the wood where the vinegar had soaked in . She frowned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door was open , and lying spilled on the floor was a large box of coarse salt , canned goods , a broom plucked of its straws.  |p130She  dropped purse and book in the rocking chair and ran through the living room to the front door , which she unlocked and flung open just as Otto took the first step to the porch . " Someone 's been in the house . " He set the straw basket down . " Here ? " And as astonishment gave way to helpless anger , he repeated " Here " without emphasisor surprise , as though he 'd learned all he needed to know in half a minute . Whoever it was had gotten through the first floor bedroom . The window had been smashed , the shutter torn from its hinges . From the foam-rubber mattress which had been dragged to the floor , the handle of a French chopping knife still protruded . The caning of the dining room chairs had been slashed , sea shells ground to dust on the floor , lamps broken , the Paisley fabric of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over every painting or photograph a giant X had been drawn with barn paint . Upstairs in the bathroom lay a decomposed catbirdin the tub , and talcum powder , aspirin , disinfectant , and mouthwash had been emptied on the floor . Clothes had been dragged out of closets and cut crazily with scissors . Books had been torn in half . In the dining room , Sophie found an empty bottle of bourbon beneath the table . Soon they stopped exclaiming ; they picked up things , examinedthem and dropped them wordlessly . Otto held up the stomped spine of a book for Sophie to observe ; Sophie showed him a shard of the Bennington-ware pitcher . He began to right the furniture , to sweep up the broken glass with cardboard backingfrom a picture . Sophie stacked the canned soups in the pantryand brought the broom handle and head into the living room . Might as well burn it . They met in front of the fireplace where , among the heaped up paperback mysteries and magazines , a hummock of dried feces sat like a rotting toad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Sophie said.  | " A battalion , " Otto said . " Let 's get out of here . " " We ca n't leave it  --  " " No , no . . . we 'll go get Mr. Haynes . That bastard . He must have known about this . " They did n't bother to lock the doors . Haynes lived a few miles away . He was the Flynders caretaker . He had once had a small potato farm , but it had failed in 1953 , and since , by then , Flynders had begun to wake from its thirty-year sleep , during which time it had declined insensibly from town to village and become a summer colony , Haynes made himself useful to the city people . He opened their houses on Memorial Day and closed them in September , and sometimesturned on heat and water for their winter vacations . He also worked as a kind of unofficial contractor , hiring people to do the various odd jobs that turned up . The Haynes property looked as if it had been assembled by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together with a variety of materials , actually left the ground at its northeastcorner and although , if one stooped , one could see timbers and planks wedged in under the floor , the illusion of imminent collapse was powerful . Three vehicles in varying stages of deterioration stood on three wheels , on two , on none , in a line more or less directed toward a shed shelter , as though they 'd been struck down just before they reached their goal . Only the Ford truck looked as if it might still run . Rubber tires leaned against every surface . Cans , tools , pails , lengths of hose , rusted grills , and summer furniture were spread out in front of the house , presenting a scene of monkeylikedistraction  --  as though each object had been snatched up and then dropped , a second 's forgetfulness erasing all memoryof original intention . A clothesline was strung across the porch and from it hung a few limp rags . A bicycle with twisted handlebars lay against the steps . And from a small chimneyp132black smoke poured as if , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still more repellent trash before it drowned them . As the Bentwoods got out of the car , a huge , seemingly jointlessdog bounded toward them from behind the house , dropped to the ground at their feet and rolled over , waving its floppy legs . When Otto stepped aside , muttering , " My God ! " the dog moaned joyfully and sprang to its feet . The door on the porch opened , and Mr. Haynes poked out a narrow unshaven face . " Get outa there , Mamba ! " he shouted at the dog . " Why , hello there , Mr. Bentwood , and Mrs. . . . What are you folks doing out here in the backwoods this time of year ? Do n't tell me summerhas climbed up and sneaked in and I did n't even know about it ! " " Hello , Mr. Haynes , " said Otto frigidly . As they stepped uneasily on the rickety boards of the porch , Mr. Haynes slid his head out a little farther and frowned . " Do n't let that dog get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her season . Too big to let in the house . Go take a seat , Mamba . She do n't mind the damp with that coat on her . " He opened the door to let them into the house . " Another present from you summer people , " he said , smiling wolfishly . " Found her on the beach over at the bay , dragging around a dead sea gull . You people and your animals ! Gawd ! If I kept all the ones got left out here , I 'd have a zoo . " Neither Sophie nor Otto had ever set foot in the Haynes ' house before . The first thing they saw , on the wall near the door , was a huge ring hung with keys and tacked up next to it , a long list of names and telephone numbers on a piece of yellow paper . In this dark damp parlor , where they were standing , there was an extraordinary number of small bookcases piled up , as in a warehouse . Whatever Mr. Haynes ' income was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summer people.  | " Nice little parlor , " he said , " but let 's go out to the kitchen . That 's where we spend our time in the cold weather . It 's friendly and warm in there and country folks do love their kitchens . " Sitting around the kitchen table like collapsed sacks of grain were Mrs. Haynes and the three Haynes children , two boys in their late teens , and a girl a few years younger . The girl was immenselyfat . From beneath a tangle of burnt-looking fairish hair , she was staring down at a copy of Life magazine , her mouth open . " Now , here 's Duane and Warren , " cried Mr. Haynes gaily . " Believe you met them once before when we fixed up your porch . And that 's Connie , the glamour girl , over there . And of course you know Mrs. Haynes here . These are the Bentwoods , Toddy , in case you do n't remember . They 've got the old Klingerplace . " " Take a seat , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like that . We 're glad to have you . " Since there were no extra chairs , Sophie and Otto continued to stand in the doorway , until , a moment later , the combined smell of dog and roast meat and hair and skin , cigarette and wood smoke , so overwhelmed them , they stepped backward into the parlor . Mr. Haynes , perhaps attributing their retreat to refinementon their part , cried , " Do n't be shy , folks ! We 're here for all the world to see ! " and , taking each of the Bentwoods by an arm , shoved them forcibly back into the kitchen . No one , during Mr. Haynes ' declaration , had stirred . Then , at some signalfrom his father , Duane rose and stretched , squeezed past Otto and Sophie and returned shortly with two straight-backed chairs . He waited with insulting patience for them to move aside so he could smack the chairs down on the kitchen floor . The Bentwoods ' preoccupation with the violence done to them temporarily abated as they confronted the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ huge black stove , across thep134front of which was written Iron Duke , could have warmed up the whole outdoors . Remains of the Sunday meal were spread out on the oilcloth-covered table . Both boys were smoking , and they continued to smoke all the time Sophie and Otto were there , as though in a vicious contest to see who would get the last Pall Mall from the pack that lay on the table next to a dish of pickles . Connie announced , " I 'm gon na watch the TV . " " You wait till we finish talking with the Bentwoods , " said Mr. Haynes , scowling at her , then smiling broadly at Otto , as though his daughter 's sullenly stated intention was an example of her charm . But Connie ignored her father . She reached across her mother to the television set which sat amid a welter of laundryon top of a new-looking washing machine . Mrs. Haynes smacked her outstretched hand . " They do n't do a thing you say , " Mrs. Haynes said complacently . " All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Toddy , we was just the same , " said Mr. Haynes , leeringat Sophie . " And we know what they want because we was young once ourselves . Right ? " " Someone got in our house and smashed up everything , " Otto said loudly . Duane and Warren straightened up and regarded the Bentwoodswith real interest , as though at last they saw some purpose in their existence . Even Connie stopped pouting and fixed her slightly protuberant eyes on their faces . Mr. Haynes ' mouth twitched and his nose reddened . " Oh , my ! " said Mrs. Haynes . " Well , imagine ! " cried her husband . " I can hardly believe it . We have n't had anything like that happen around here . It 's differentout on the shore where you get all that city riffraff . But , here . . . Why , Tom is supposed to do a weekly check on the summer places . Is n't he , Toddy ? You know , Tom the state trooper , do n't you , Mr. Bentwood ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saying how quiet it is in Flynders , what a relief it was to come to our little village . No crime around here . Right , boys ? I said , right ? " Duane snickered and ground out his cigarette in his plate , instantlytaking another . " Right , Daddy , " said Warren . " I 'll go call Tom , " Haynes said . " He 's off today . Still , he can just get his butt out there to your place . We 'll take care of this situation . " " Did they steal any valuables ? " asked Mrs. Haynes , looking at Sophie intently . " Nothing seems to be missing , " she answered . " They just wrecked what was there . " " It might be kids , you know , " Mr. Haynes offered in a somewhatsorrowful voice , " after liquor . You summer people leave all that liquor around , you know . It 's just too damn much for some young folks . You people come and go . But they have to stay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He smiled and bent forward , a hand on each knee , his truculence gleaming through his smile like a stone under water . Mrs. Haynes absently tore off a piece of meat from the roast , which had cooled in its fat , and stuffed it into her mouth . Connie went back to her magazine . " All right , folks . Let 's go look at the damage , " said Haynes . " Warren , when are you going to take that goddamn Caddie to the bone yard ? I ca n't get the Chevy out of the shed with that thing lying there across the road . " " You can back it around like you always do , " Warren snapped . " There 's lots of things I want to take out of that wagon still . You said yourself this morning that there 's a lot we can use in it . " Mr. Haynes shrugged helplessly . " Do n't do a thing their fathersays , " he told Otto . " No respect . " And he smiled . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We 'd like to get to it . " " Let me call Tom , " said Haynes . He stood up and took a short leather jacket from a peg on the wall . " I have n't been outp136yet today . But it do n't look cold . Is it ? " Otto shook his head , then said " No " in a choked voice . Haynes left the room . Mrs. Haynes stared at the dirty dishes . Duane began to tap a glass with a spoon . " Stop that noise ! " cried Mrs. Haynes angrily . He gave her a fierce look and went to the back door , cursing it when the lock jammed , then yanking it open and slamming it behind him . " We 'll wait in the car , " said Otto in Mrs. Haynes ' direction . She nodded indifferently and then heaved a massive sigh . " Help me clear , Connie , " she said . Connie shook her head , but her mother yanked her to her feet . As Sophie looked back , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the table . " Tom 'll meet us in half an hour , " announced Mr. Haynes , fighting off the frantic embrace of Mamba as he got into the back seat of the Mercedes . He apologized elaborately for the dog as he shoved her out onto the ground , and then for his dirty boots . He seemed to suggest that the Bentwoods really would have preferred him to run along behind the car . Otto cut short his apologies by enumerating the damages to the house . When they drove into the yard , Sophie experienced an intense reluctance to go back into the house , but once inside , she felt a kind of lassitude . Tom , the trooper , arrived in half an hour as he had promised . He was dressed nattily in civilian clothes , his hair was slicked down , his face clean-shaven , his expression bland and his voice impersonal . " Could have been anyone , " he said , after he had looked around . " There 's been a lot of this kind of stuff these last few years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything , maybe a radio or something little they can carry . Do you have a radio ? No ? And you ca n't find anything missing ? Well , I do n't supposethey 'd have much use for what you 've got in here . " He waved his hand at the living room as though by his own esti/mate of the wreckage , there could n't have been anything of much value . " They 're running wild these days , " he said . " We got our hands full with drug takers , and the hippies from the city that hole up out here for the winter . One couple  --  you would n't believe it  --  they lived in someone 's old barn for two months before we spotted them . They 're not as dumb as they look , you know . These two knew our routine and when we came around to check up on the property , there was n't a sign of life . " " No ! " exclaimed Mr. Haynes . " You mean , a boy and a girl ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We might never have got them if they had n't taken in some stray dog that set up a howl when we parked the car near the barn . " Then he took care of official culpabilityby telling the Bentwoods he 'd just been around to check on their house the week before . " Everything looked okay then , " he said . " We did n't find any broken windows or anything . " Sophiethought about the catbird . It had been dead a long time , and it would n't , in any case , have been flying around the house in dead winter . She glanced at Tom 's impassive face . Perhaps he did n't even know he had lied ; perhaps he only recognized a lie when it was refuted . " But there is a dead bird in the tub , " she said in a low , unsteadyvoice , " and it 's been dead for a while . " Tom turned to Sophie and stared at her silently , his unblinkingeyes fixed on hers . Then he said without emphasis , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll go measure that window , " said Mr. Haynes , " and get out here first thing in the morning to fix it . I think I got a piece of glass in the shed that ought to do . " He took a round tape measurefrom his jacket pocket . " Look at that ! " he cried happily . " I was n't even sure it was going to be there when I reached in . " " What are we to do ? " asked Otto . " Do we have to get bars for the windows ? " " I doubt they 'll try again , " Tom said , turning his back on So/phie . " I mean they 've taken care of you . I 'm sorry this happened . But at least , they did n't burn the house down . We 've had two fires out at Mascuit . " " They burn up the whole house ? " shouted Haynes from the bedroom . He walked back into the living room , trying to get the tape to roll back into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he muttered . " They burned both houses to the ground . One of the owners is in Europe and we ca n't even get hold of him . " Sophie thought , or imagined , she heard a small note of satisfaction in Tom 's voice . It was hard to tell ; he did n't show much more than his bodily surface . God knows what was running around inside . Tom departed with a belligerent shifting of gears , then Otto and Haynes got into the Mercedes and drove off . Sophie ate half a ham sandwich and a hard-boiled egg in the kitchen , where there was less damage than in the other rooms . Later , filling paper sacks with debris , she felt the beginning of composure . As she worked , she caught sight of the meadows through the kitchen window . The crumbling remains of an old stone wall caught the sunlight in its earth-filled crevices . She gathered up the dead bird in paper toweling and did what she could with the bathroom floor . There was no water to scrub it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basement and carried the pile of feces out behind the house and flung it as far as she could . When Otto returned , she told him nothing had been taken except the flashlight she kept in their bedroom . And she was sure there had been very little bourbon left in the bottle she 'd found beneath the table . He had gone to stand at the kitchen window and was looking out . " What I 'll miss most , after I 'm dead , " he said , " is that light in the late afternoon . "  | " They might have burned the house , Otto , " she said . " It could have been much worse . " " I 'll take out the bird and the crap , " he said . " I did that . " " It 's a little like flushing the toilet just before the Titanic goes down , " he said . " We did n't sink , " she said . " We 've just been roughed up . " " I wish someone would tell me how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her a glance . The half-question affected her unpleasantly , and she turned her head away instantly so he could not see her face . She felt the injustice of her own response  --  what if his words were puerile ? The plea behind them was not . But she could n't tell anyone how to live ! Maybe it would have been all right if he had n't looked at her  --  if he had cried out , forgetting self , forgetting how what he said might sound , if he had shouted , " I do n't know how to live ! " " There 's no one to say , " she said flatly . " Maybe we should move away . " " Where ? " " I ca n't even move away . I could n't start up a practice at my age in Chicago , or any other place . " " I do n't like Chicago . " " How about Halifax ? " " It 's only furniture ... " " There is n't any place for the way I feel . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " But do n't you see how savage it is ? And empty . . . I would n't mind being shot in a revolution , or having my home burned . . . . " She laughed wildly . " You would n't mind being shot ! " she cried . " There 'd be some purpose to it , " he said stubbornly , grabbing up a mutilated sketch of the house someone had drawn forp140them , and flourishing it at her . " This is meaningless . It does n't represent an idea . It is primitive , the void ... " " Maybe it 's in a language you do n't speak  --  " " Are you defending pigs who shit in your fireplace ! " he demandedfuriously . " Oh , Otto , " she said , and rested her head on her arm . " I wonder if those Haynes cretins had something to do with it . How they hate us ! Did you see how gratified they were by this trouble of ours ? Everything in that kitchen was just the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the washingmachine , and Duane straddling his chair and that 1953 calendar  --  itall said one thing to me . It said , die . " She went into the living room and looked around the bare walls . All the sweet , pretty things were gone , things she had found in junk shops or picked off the ground , or bought in antiquestores . Otto took care of cars and insurance policies , real estate and hotel reservations , all that . But he was not a collector . " I suppose we 've got insurance to cover this , " she called back to him . " Give me a category , " he said in a bitter voice , coming to the kitchen door , still holding the sketch . " What 's it called ? " " Oh , Christ ! " she exclaimed . " It 's called vandalism , and that 's all it 's called .... " They drove through the village without commenting on the familiar landmarks ; the copper beeches looked dead , like stage trees , an affectation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had reached the highway , departing from his custom of giving one of the Flynders stations his business . The parkway drugged her . The car went up and down ramps like a mechanical toy at the end of a metal arm . It was midway to darkness ; suddenly the lights came on . Then gradually , in the pale emptiness of her mind , there was a flush of memory . She had felt something like this once before , during the year after Francis had gone back to Locust Valley . Then , as now , ap141debilitating fatigue had overcome her . She had suffered slight but persistent fevers . Noel had shot her full of vitamin B-12 and bluntly suggested a consultation with a psychiatric colleague . She 'd refused , coming out of her stupor long enough to say to Noel that as it was she could n't bear to think about herself . She had lost weight , grown haggard , idle , and indifferent . She sat up violently , hitting her arm against the door . She did n't want that emptiness .. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Nothing . " He spoke to her again , but she did n't understand him . He looked over at her . " I said , perhaps we 'd better try to think about adopting a child again . Did n't you hear me ? " " All right . " " All right ! Is that how you feel ? " " You 've no right to ask me that . I exhausted feeling aboutthat subject a long time ago . When I wanted to do it , you behavedas though I 'd asked you to get me a harvester . " " Well , I 'm thinking about it differently . " " I do n't believe you 're serious . If I thought you were serious ... " " Then what ? " " I do n't know .... " " Take my hand ! " he demanded suddenly , and held his handout toward her . She hesitated , then reached across herself withher right hand , and gripped his in it . He held it for a second . " Is the bite still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It 's still tender . " " Did you take those pills ? " " I forgot , out there . " " That 's over , at least . " " Not yet . When will they kill the cat ? " They were going through Queens now , but in the dark , picked at feebly by the lights , it was only a series of roads.  | " After they 've examined it , " he said . " They do n't keep it  --  well , I know it would be after they examinedit , Otto . I mean , do they keep it for a week or a day or two , in case someone might take it ? " " That old brute ? Who would take it ? " " Can you stay home tomorrow until noon ? " " Why do you persist in thinking they 're going to call you ? " " There 's always a chance they might . " " All right , then ! " he exploded angrily . " Then you 'll have the shots , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possibly , they wo n't even work ! " She felt immensely cheered by his outburst . " You do n't understand , " she said , almost gratefully . " It 's what 's behind it that bothers me . " " We 've had a few bad days . There 's nothing behind anything . What in God 's name do you want ? Do you want Charlie to murder me ? Do you wish the farmhouse had been burned down ? Do you wish that Negro man had killed us ? And a bulletto have lodged itself in Mike Holstein 's wall instead of a rock on the floor ? Do you want to be rabid ? " " But , by extension , everything you say could have come true ! One more step , one more minute  --  " " But it did n't ! " he shouted , driving jerkily and fumbling with the shift stick . " God , I went through a red light ! " " Ca n't you take the morning off ? " " No , " he said harshly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " " I have to be there . If I let go now , it 'll be a disaster . Sophie  --  " he cried importunately , " it 's all I know . " After a while , she said , " Never mind what I say . " " I ca n't , " he replied quietly . " I do n't and I ca n't . " She made supper for them while he went through his insurancefile . After they 'd eaten , they made a list of the repairs they would have to make , and what they 'd have to replace . " Allp143those beds , " said Otto . " Why did they slash away so at those ? " They 'd have to let Haynes continue as caretaker . If they hired someone else , Haynes would do them in somehow . " I noticed you hesitated to go in after I unlocked the door when we got home , " Otto said . " I had some morbid image , " she said . " I thought they might have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said . They read very late , sitting up in bed against pillows and drinking glasses of red wine . As usual , Otto fell asleep first . The house creaked quietly to itself in the dark . Around three o'clock , an east wind blew down the street , moving the stiff young branches of the maple trees . A small gray mouse ran from beneath the Bentwood refrigerator , across the kitchen floor , and out to the dining room , where it wedged itself beneathan armoire in which Sophie kept the table linen . It must have heard something that frightened it , for it jammed itself still farther under the armoire , to a point where the old cedar floor planking had buckled , then it could not back out . The white-and-gray cat watched the telephone wires and tree branches which the wind had stirred into movement . It balanceditself with habitual ease on the narrow ledge of a fence crosspiece . The man who lived in the house across the Bentwoodback yard , rose , stumbled to the window , and relieved himself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the splatter of water on the Victorian garden path . The man collapsedback into bed . On the next floor , a small infant awoke and began to cry . It cried for a long time by itself in the wet dark , its belly and buttocks twisting and straining , the sheer force of its wails lifting the small trunk up and down like a pump . The father got up from his bed and crossed the room to the crib , where he stood looking down into it . As his eyes grew accustomed to the dark , he saw the vertical movement of the infant'sbody . He did nothing ; his hands hung at his sides , mo/tionless . His T-shirt fell to just below his navel , and he was conscious of the wind which blew through cracks in the window , where the plastic had torn loose from the tacks . The wind chilled his genitals and thighs , and he curved his hands in front of himself , making a kind of nest for his penis . He continued to observe his bawling son , holding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at this time of morning , and the father would often come and observe him in this way . He did n't know what his wife did , or thought , when it was she who came to the crib . Tonight she had not stirred . All at once , the child 's wailing died away completely . A familiar odor drifted up from the now relaxedand motionless body . " All that for a shit ! " the father mutteredto himself in Spanish . " What a scandalous life it is .... " The baby 's cry had awakened Otto . He stared into the dark , listening to that distant squeal that was so like a cat 's . By the time it suddenly stopped , he was thoroughly awake . He turned and saw the dark mass of Sophie 's hair on the sheet beside him . She 'd pushed the pillow off the bed in her sleep . He sniffed at her hair . There was a faint trace of the perfume she always wore , but it floated on a rather stronger chemical smell . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to alcohol . Next birthday , he would buy her three small bottles instead . He could tell by her breathing that her mouth was open against the sheet . He touched her hair . It was thick , strong , lively hair . The nape of her neck was warm , faintly damp where her hair was silkier , more tender somehow . He nestled his hand there , beneath the heavy mass ; his hand seemed to be his whole self , hiding in the dark . She grumbled once , but he ignoredher complaint . She was lying on her stomach . He grasped her shoulder and pulled her toward him until she sunk against him . He began to push up her short nylon gown . He knew she must be awake . But he would not speak her name . He would not say anything at all . Sometimes , over the years , that had happened , his not wanting to talk to her . It did n't mean he wasp145angry . But sometimes , after a movie or a play or the company had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her . It was a very deep feeling , a law of his own nature that , now and then , had to be obeyed . He loved Sophie  --  he thought about her , the kind of woman she was  --  and she was so tangled in his life that the time he had sensed she wanted to go away from him had brought him more suffering than he had conceived it possible for him to feel . He pressed his hand down flat on her hip . Still she said nothing . He was suddenly angry , but he realized , as he maintained his own stubborn silence , it was not because of sexual disappointmentso much as an exasperation similar to what he felt when he had to grab her arm to make her keep up with him when they walked together down a street . He tightened his grip on her hip and turned her toward him , and as she sank below him on her back he saw by a faint glimmerof street light shining through the cracks in the window shutters , the dark smudges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perversely gratified by the discomfort he was inflictingon them both , he entered her . When he withdrew , after an orgasm of an intensity he had not expected , he had the fleeting thought that his sudden impulse had had little to do with sensuality . She stirred slightly , then shifted to her side , drew up her legs and pushed her back up against him . " Oh , well . . . " she murmured . " Sorry , " he whispered , then was choked by a wave of laughter . He 'd got her that time.  |p146It  was six in the morning . Through the open kitchen door , Sophiefelt the morning sunlight on her bare feet like a sustained and mindless stare . She poured herself a shot glass of whisky , then drank it down hastily , catching glimpses , as her head fell back , of the waxed surface of kitchen cabinets , a flash of scoured pots , a line of sharp Sabatier knives gripped by a strip of magnet . She set the glass down in the sink and saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dried gray spume circling the drain , the residue , the mark of the night tides from a hidden urban sea of pipes and sewers . Turning on the tap , she flushed out the sink , makingloud childish sounds of disgust , momentarily amused by her own noise . Then she walked quickly to the dining room , feelinga sudden intense desire for more sunlight , for signs of life in the windows across the yard . A book lay open on the dining room table , a red pencil separatingits pages . A cup stood next to it , and in the cup was a wilted slice of lemon . Otto must have come down to read duringthe night . Before or after he 'd jumped her ? she wondered , reminding herself she 'd been maltreated but not feeling so . The small still life echoing Otto 's presence filled her with uncertainty . Although she had only just left him asleep upstairs , having waked in an instant from deep sleep to find herself standing next to the bed , shivering and displaced as though she 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , paradoxically , cast a doubt on his proximity . But then , it was probably the whisky . She had never had a drink at six in the morning  --  itwas a hell of a way to start Monday . He had underlined a passage and she bent over the book top147read it . She caught a reference to antipopery riots , then : " Strings of boys of fourteen were hung up in a row to vindicate the law , " and after that a quote from an observer : " I never saw boys cry so ! ' " " To vindicate the law , " had been underlined twice . There was no end to it , she thought , looking through the door at the yard , not pausing in her mind to name the thing there was no end to . She closed the book on the pencil and put it away on a shelf , washed out the cup , and filled the coffee pot with water . As often as not , she slept late on Monday , but that tardiness continued to trouble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She woke now , as she had then , to a faint malaise , a sense of a foothold gained just in time . Monday had always been a terrible trouble  --  once she had tried to stay awake all Sunday night to forestall her mother 's grim and unforgiving presence in her doorway  --  but she had fallen asleep just before dawn , to be awakened two hours later by her mother clapping her hands relentlessly over the bed , her face shining from her morning scrub , dressed in a starched house dress , saying over and over , " Early risers are the winners . " It had been thirty years since Sophie had been roused by that derisive applause ; she had not yet discovered the nature of the prize her mother 's words had once led her to believe existed . Perhaps winning had simply meant the tyranny of waking others . A man across the way was watching her . She stared back through the quiet sunny space between them , not aware that she was really looking at him , until she saw his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , saw his hands that had been clasped before his loins slowly part . She turned away quickly , thinking , that is his prize . Then , sneaking another look back , saw that he was now holding an infant in his arms , kissingits neck with an intensity she could almost feel on her own . In her mother 's house , blessings had been enumerated every day , a joyless catechism in which ( her father having abjured allp148recitation ) she had had to take part , if only with a ritual " yes " as her mother shouted , " You have space , good food , new shoes , a room of your own , toys , clean clothes , education , background . . . " While small Sophie nervously ate raisins and cried , " Yes , yes , yes .... " On a Sunday now and then , the three of them got into the Buick at her mother 's insistence , and drove to where " the poor people " lived . It was the tail-end of the Depression , but in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sophie 's mother had driven the car with thickskinnedefficiency , her head locked into position like a piece of ordnance , eyes straight ahead , triumphant in her silence . When she said poor people , she meant poor people . How had Otto felt , reading those lines sometime during the night ? Had the hanging of young boys appalled him ? But why had he underlined the words ? Did he mean that the horror of law is that it must be vindicated ? Or had he thought of himself , of his own longing for order ? Or was the double line an expression of irony ? Or did he think law was only another form of that same brute impulse which it was directed toward restraining ? They had been married for fifteen years . What did she know of what he thought ? She knew him in the density of their life together , not outside of it . " What are you doing up so early ? " " Drinking , " she answered . Otto yawned , then caught sight of the whisky bottle in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " It 's very good in the morning , " she said . " Much better than at parties . " " Let 's see your hand . " She held it out for his inspection . " The swelling has gonecompletely , has n't it . . . does n't look bad at all , " he said . " You look as if you 'd been on a binge , " she said . " Were youup all night ? " She began to set the table for breakfast . " For a while . I read and had some tea . Then I went back top149sleep , then the baby woke me . . . . You 're not worried about the tests on the cat now , are you ? I 've never seen you up so early , not since we were first married . " " Did I used to get up before you ? " she asked , surprised , as though he had given her startling news that had some immediaterelevance . He was pouring himself coffee . " Are you ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forgettingwhat she had asked him . " Until I hear from them , I probably will be . " " But they wo n't call , Sophie . " " What a nasty indifferent way to manage things ! I have to wait until noon without a word from them . Then , a minute later , I 'm supposed to know everything is all right ? " " I ca n't stand that frozen orange juice  --  " " What law has to be vindicated ? " she asked . He rubbed his face vigorously with both hands as he always did in the mornings before he shaved , and gave her a puzzled look . " What law ? " " A sentence you underlined in that book you were reading . I found it here on the table with your red pencil . " He looked at her reflectively , then set down the can of orange juice he had started to open . " It is never vindicated , " he said at last . " The law is a process , not an absolute . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Those hanged children were absolutes , " she said bitterly . Then she added , her voice spiteful , " That 's one thing I know about the difference between you and Charlie . He 's not going to spend his days meditating on the nature of the law ! " What in God 's name had she said ? She 'd been so intensely angry , but what she 'd said  --  well , she 'd meant something cataclysmic , crushing , final . Instead , she 'd come out with some gibberish . " You 're right about that , " Otto said flatly . " Charlie is notp150going to think about anything . I was considering sending him a telegram  --  to his new quarters . I was going to say : ' Congratulationson a successful life ! ' " He gave her a cold , sad look , then trudged down the hall , but returned shortly with the daily newspaper in his hand . " Do you think I would have had those children hanged ? " he asked her . " I do n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know how I would have felt . It would , I suppose , have depended upon whether I was a Catholic or a Protestantin 1790 . " She groaned aloud , then slammed down the butter dish . The hatred she felt toward him was so unexpected , so powerful , she felt as though she 'd hurled herself across the table at him . He walked quickly to her and put his hand on her arm . " Sophie . . . " he said softly . " I could n't hang a cat ... . What is it ? What is it ? " " I 'll get dressed , " she murmured , turning away her Medusa 's face , feeling herself disfigured by the detestation that had so quickly possessed her and was now , just as quickly , draining away . At breakfast , they avoided each other 's glance . They read the newspaper , exchanging sections without comment . Just as he was about to leave , Sophie asked him if he thought Charlie would be in the office today . He hoped not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyone would need to clean things up . No one was giving anyone a party . " It 's the way things really end , " he said . " I wish you could stay home , " she said despondently . " I would . . . if it were really necessary . " " Necessary ! " He grabbed up his briefcase , gave her a look of pure exasperation , and shouted , " Sophie ! It 's too much ! " and closed the door on whatever she might have shouted back.  |p151It  was eight thirty . She was indignant that he had gone , leaving her in the chilly entryway , still wordlessly begging that some incident would force him back , that he would have forgotten something , and that once he opened the door , he would not see any reason for going . She even waited several minutes , poised forward , listening . He was like everyone else , witlessly inflexible , treating his own actions as if they stemmed from inexorable natural laws . Damn him ! He had closed her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been had he stayed ! Both of them , brooding about the house , waiting for the telephone to ring . . . Madam , the cat was rabid . . . go to the Board of Health . Was it the phone call she was afraid of ? Or was it that she knew she would refuse those inoculations ? Was that why , against all reason , reassurances , statistics , she continued to believe in nothing but the event itself ? And that the appalling certainty that the phone would ring before noon did not arise from reason or its systems , but was a fatal estimate of her true life ? " God , if I am rabid , I am equal to what is outside , " she said out loud , and felt an extraordinary relief as though , at last , she 'd discovered what it was that could create a balance between the quiet , rather vacant progression of the days she spent in this house , and those portents that lit up the dark at the edge of her own existence . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and over , I have to think . Think , she commanded her reflection in the bathroom mirror . Then she covered her face with a cream that had cost $25 for four ounces . She observed the terrible and irreversible vigor of the white hairs that thrust their coarse way among the black hairs . Her mouth was softening , spreading into ambiguity ; the sharp outline of her chin was being erased by a subtle pouchingp152of the flesh . She wiped off the cream and washed her face roughly with soap . When she looked back once more into the mirror , cleansed , her cheeks and forehead naked as a body can be naked , she smiled winningly , hoping to forestall some judgmentagainst herself that she felt forming in the wake of her investigation of her fading surface . But the judgment  --  whatever it had been  --  slipped away before she could grasp it . What she saw , for an instant , were her father 's defeated energiesin her eyes , and mixed with that , the insistent force of her mother 's lineaments , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , finger on glass finger . The phone rang . She went to it without haste . She was n't expectinganything now . It was Tanya , the spinster Sophie had known for years , who telephoned her from time to time . She must have broken off with a man or started up with a new one . They rarely saw each other now , although once there had existed between them a tie of sorts , one of sensibility perhaps . That had been when Sophie was still caught up with translations , and in the way of her work had met a number of people who had at the time seemed interesting to her . Tanya was the only one she continued to hear from . She had worked then , and still did , for a French news agency , and had once written a short essay on Adolphe which had been published by a three-pound quarterly , which had disappearedafter the fifth issue , dead of its own weight perhaps . Despite the essay 's eccentric and precious style , Sophie had been struck by its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's cold , thin , aging-girl personality . She was home today , recoveringfrom a cold , and had suddenly thought of Sophie , she said , wondered how she was , if she was working on anything , they had n't seen each other in so long , and did Sophie think she ought to go to Peru or Mexico this summer ? But before Sophie could answer , Tanya went on to describe the latest in her staggeringlylong succession of affairs.  |p153So|phie  sat down heavily on the bed , gripping the phone and staring fixedly at the hands of the clock on her bedside table . There had been so many men for Tanya  --  she was like a time capsule into which men deposited messages that were to be read in the dust centuries hence . No man had ever , apparently , reached that mother 's girl . She remained , as always , a birdlike voice on the phone , dressed at the moment for convalescence , Sophie was sure , in an expensive and ill-fitting housecoat , implacable , imperturbable , grossly virginal . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whore , she 's not frigid  --  just a lunatic . " His wife is a clod , " said Tanya . " The poor little animal crawls into my bed as if it were Chartres . Do you know , he 's painted my whole flat for me ! Three coats ! He 's got arthritis of the wrist , too , but he knows how broke I am and the walls were that New York despair color , so he just did it himself . He 's a darling little animal  --  " " Why do n't you make a retreat for six months ! " Sophie interrupted , shouting . " Do n't you know how dumb you are ? You think because somebody 's husband sticks it in you , that you 've won ! You poor dumb old collapsed bag ! Who are you kid-ding ! " God , had she killed her dead ? There was n't a sound at the other end of the telephone , not a whisper of breath . Sophie was trembling , her hands wet . Then she heard a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broken teeth from a hurt mouth . " You . . . filthy . . . cunt ! " it said . Sophie dropped the phone on its hook . She began to clean the house scrupulously , averting her mind from the astonishing exchange that had taken place on the phone , and from her own furious outburst , giving her whole attentionnow to the lavender-scented English wax with which she was polishing the furniture . The peak hour of morning traffic had passed . It was quiet out/side on the street . But that was a deception . There was a siege going on : it had been going on for a long time , but the besieged themselves were the last to take it seriously . Hosing vomit off the sidewalk was only a temporary measure , like a good intention . The lines were tightening  --  Mike Holstein had known that , standing in his bedroom with the stone in his hand  --  but it was almost impossible to know where the lines were . Sophie made herself a cup of strong coffee and went to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother before the urge died , before it was too late . She would have something to tell her this time , a story to cover the emptiness of the page , to belie the true silence between them which had begun when Sophiehad left home , after she had awakened for the last time to that jeering applause . She would write her about the cat ; her mother would enjoy that . She would describe the incident in such a way it would strike the exact note calculated to arouse the old woman 's scorn and hilarity . From a drawer she took out paper and envelope . She filled the old fountain pen Otto had found for her in an antique shop from a small crystal ink bottle that stood on its own silver claw feet . The foot of the desk chair was caught in the fringes of the rug and , just as she bent down to disentangle it , she heard the sound of a key in the front door . She stood up and glanced at the bedside clock in surprise . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ audible on the stairs ; then he walked into the bedroom . " I took care of a few things , then planned to come right home , " he said . He looked very tired . " I was going to call you to tell you I was coming , but I was afraid the phone 's ringing would scare you . You 'd think it was about the cat turning up crazy . The subway was awful . I was wild . I left the office at ten thirty and it 's taken me all this time . Some youths were on a rampage . They broke some windows and . . . youths ! "  |p155With  consuming bitterness , he repeated the last word . " So the trains were all delayed . I did n't know what to do . " " It was all right , " she said . " The A.S.P.C.A. did n't call , of course . I suppose they 'll get rid of the cat right away ? What do they do ? Garrote it ? But someone did phone . Tanya @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then I dropped the other shoe . I mean , I told her I was sick of her . She called me a filthy cunt . " Otto winced . He did n't like that . Sophie laughed . " Oh , it was the correct adjective , filthy , the one she really meant to use . She is like a fairy , you know . Stop looking that way ! I felt bad , but only for a second . " " What have you been doing since I left ? " " Not much . Just now , I thought I 'd write to my mother . I thought of something to tell her about . " He was staring at her . " I 'm glad you came home , " she said . The extension phone on the desk rang . With a certain reluctance , he reached for it . She shook her head and placed her hand on the receiver . " I know they wo n't call now . I tell you , I know it , " she said irritably . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there ? " asked Charlie Russel . " I called the office and they said he 'd left to go home . I have to talk to him . " " Just a minute . " She held the phone out to Otto . " It 's Char-lie . " Otto shook himself like a wet dog . " No ! No ! I wo n't talk to him . " " He wo n't talk to you , " Sophie repeated into the mouthpiece . " I 've got to talk to him , " Charlie cried . " There are a thousand things . . . how long does he think he can avoid this ? What about precedent contracts ? You put him on ! " She held out the receiver again . Otto looked down at it . They could both hear Charlie 's diminished voice like an insect cry . " I 'm desperate ! " screeched the round black hole . " He 's desperate ! " Otto shouted . His distraught glance sud/denly fell upon the ink bottle on Sophie 's desk . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it violently at the wall . Sophiedropped the phone on the floor and ran to him . She flungher arms around him so tightly that for a moment he could not move . The voice from the telelphone went on and on like gas leaking from a pipe . Sophie and Otto had ceased to listen . Her arms fellaway from his shoulders as they both turned slowly toward thewall , turned until they could both see the ink running down tothe floor in black lines.
