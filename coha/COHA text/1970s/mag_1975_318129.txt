Cambodia is a ruined fairyland , with a government to match . Even foreign diplomats who privately hope that the present regime can pull through have been exasperated by the indolence and unrealistic attitudes of President Lon Nol , who sometimes acts as if the war were taking place in another country . Last week , for example , rumors circulated in Phnom-Penh for several days that he might resign , which could possibly pave the way toward some kind of negotiations with the Khmer Rouge insurgents . Instead , Lon Nol staged a modest Cabinet reshuffling and fired his arrogant commander in chief , Lieut . General Sosthene Fernandez , who is hated both for his corruption ( his army payroll is inflated with fake names ) and for refusing to take orders from the National Assembly . At the presidential palace , Lon Nol threw a champagne party for Fernandez and his successor , Lieut . General Sak Sutsakhan . Fernandez wept and kissed the national flag as the green-and-red sash of the Grand Cross was placed over his shoulders . <P> Lon Nol also asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Premier since December 1973 , to form a new government . This task , however , did not go quite so smoothly as the long overdue sacking of Fernandez . The problem was that Lon Nol 's younger brother , Lon Non , was back on the scene trying to regain a position in the government . Two years ago , under pressure from the U.S. , Lon Nol sent his ruthless brother , who had become an extremely powerful palace figure , overseas as a roving good-will ambassador . The rivalry between Lon Non and Premier Boret was reportedly delaying formation of a new Cabinet last week . " Here it is , at one minute to midnight , " snapped one disgusted Western diplomat , " and these guys are still haggling over who is going to be what in the new government . " <P> The intrigues at the presidential palace had little effect on life in the besieged capital . In front of the huge , unfinished Cambodiana Hotel , which now serves as a camp for 5,000 homeless refugees , emaciated children chanted , " O.K. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew , as enemy bombs fell on the opposite bank of the Mekong River . Inside , a line of hollow-eyed mothers clutching half-dead infants waited patiently to enter the World Vision clinic . One baby 's head hung limply to the side , eyes closed and mouth agape , its body swaddled in a green-and-white T shirt that bore the words HELLO , DARLING . Said Clinic Director Carl B. Harris of Washington , D.C. : " It 's not only the babies who are starving . Many of the mothers have hemoglobin levels below 60%. "
