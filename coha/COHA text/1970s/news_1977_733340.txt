txt A driver with a CB radio might put it this way : " Watch out for the Big Smokey who is shooting for the Double-Nickel . " This bit of highway electronic lingo would warn those behind the wheel that the nation 's top law enforcer , Jimmy Carter , aims to enforce vigorously the U.S. speed limit of 55 miles per hour ( the " Double-Nickel " ) . ( " Smokey " is a state ' trooper . ) The administration 's goal : to have 85 out of every 100 vehicles on the nation 's highways traveling below 55 m.p.h. by 1985 . At present , only 30 percent of U.S. motorists cruise under the limit on cross-country interstates , according to a special report ordered by President Carter in August and just completed . In accepting the report from the U.S. Department of Transportation ( DOT ) , the White House sets in motion the following actions against heavy-footed highway scofflaws : // From pa  --  e 1 Making states toe the 55 m.p.h. line ? States which are lax in enforcement of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? will be punished or rewarded using small amounts of the $7 billion or so of U.S. highway aid passed out each year , according to DOT officials who must first obtain Congress ' approval for the plan . ? States overburdened with a high number of speeders will be asked by DOT to divert some $30 million in already-authorized safety funds toward beefing up police radar patrols next year . Congress will be asked to approve $30 to $50 million a year specifically for the pa-trols starting in 1980 . ? Public support for the 55-m.p.h. speed limit will be rallied with increased advertising , speeches by federal officials , and examples set by drivers complying with the law . In 1976 , the campaign slogan " It 's a law you can live with " found its way into $27 million of free advertising . For the first time , the DOT report ranks states on how well they are complying with the 55 speed limit . ( The best measure , say DOT officials is the number of vehicles exceeding 60 m.p.h. since most police allow a 5 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Wyoming , North Dakota , Maine , New Mexico , Texas , Arizona , Georgia , Utah , and Nevada . The 10 best for the first half of 1977 were : New Jersey , Colorado , Louisiana , Idaho , Hawaii , Minnesota , Oregon , Virginia , Maryland , and New York . The number of vehicles going over 60 m.p.h. has been cut in half nationwide since the law went into effect in January , 1974 , officials say . And , they add , this slowing trend has contributed to about half of the 21 percent drop in fatality rates on the highways since the Arab oil embargo . During the same period , the number of speeding tickets nearly has doubled . But average U.S. speeds are creeping up again , thus forcing Mr. Carter to call for - action . In 1976 , 16 states had averages below 55 m.p.h . So far in 1977 , only 10 states are below the limit . DOT officials now rank the speed limit 's lifesaving impact as more important than its gasoline-saving possibilities . Still , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. oil usage by 2 percent ? or about one-fifth of President Carter 's goal of a 10 percent reduction by 1985.
