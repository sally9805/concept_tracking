txt The visitor to- Earth known as Agent Alpha has always had the worst time with his December reports . How to explain to the folks back home in Galaxy 7 the mystery of this planet-Earth custom called Christmas ? Yet each year his duty as investigative ( and interpretative ) reporter of earthlings forces him to confront the seasonal challenge . At the moment the Galaxy 7 spacecraft hovers overhead . The deadline is upon Agent Alpha . On his computer he punches out as warm-up : " The quick silver rocket-ship chases the lazy pink satellite . " " Christmas , " he begins ? and stops . Bits of tinsel scholarship ? the origin of the tree , pseudo-learned comparisons of Santa Claus , Father Christmas , and St. Nick ? float through his head , but out of his fingers comes " On Donner , on Blitzen ... " Scratch that , Galaxy 7 . Has he been away too long ? Agent Alpha knows they are asking that , and as a matter of fact , he is thinking of them as " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " we . " So be it . This year he will try to explain Christmas to himself , and never mind " them . " " Christmas , " he begins again , " has become a ritual within a ritual . Each December there is the ritual of the tree , the presents , the Christmas carols , the parties , and ( possibly ) the extraordinary visit to church . There is also now the Christmas ritual of analyzing and debating all the above Christmas rituals . " Like old ornaments , the slightly battered questions come down from the attic : " Is Christmas ? for maybe the 47th time ? becoming too commercial ? " Should Santa Claus be abolished ? or just the office party ? " Ought people to make gifts rather than buy them ? " Or ought everybody to donate to charity and forget family and friends , including absolutely unpresentable Aunt Margaret ? " Such Christmas writhings have become so intense , so unsettling that , after the ministers and editorial writers are through , the psychologists stand by as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rate has increased this Christmas . " In short , Christmas has become a ' problem , ' like all the other earthling problems  --  a holiday , one is tempted to say , that needs a holiday after it . " What is the problem ? Here is one more analysis , Galaxy 7 ? mine . " Earthlings are very good at certain kinds of verbs : to buy , to sell , to produce . It 's verbs like to love and to give they have trouble with . // From page 1 A Christmas dispatch from Agent Alpha They have to read a manual or take a course on verbs like these . " Yet they know that to give , to love is at the heart of Christmas . They have been taught that the child in the manger is the gift of God ? the proof of God 's love ? and that the Three Wise Men brought gifts to acknowledge this gift-without-compare . " In other words , they are aware ( from the neck up ) that Christmas is a world of lovebeyond-words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems to embarrass a lot of earthlings today . " Is Christmas a gift they no longer want ? " Christmas for a lot of earthlings has certainly become a forced act . They give but without the feel of giving . They ho-ho but with an effort that makes ' merry ' seem an archaic word . " Too often Christmas has become the season when earthlings measure their material wealth and their spiritual bankruptcy . " Is Earth ready to join Galaxy 7 ? This is the question I was sent here to answer . This is the question I ask myself four years later . As you know from my reports , I 've become quite attached to cornflakes , the World 's Greatest Jazz Band , and Barbara Walters . Stilt I retain my ruthless standards . If earthlings can regain ? what shall I say ? ? their gift for Christmas . they will pass the test for Galaxy 7. as well as all their own tests . I am optimistic , but not unduly so . Let 's wait until next year . " In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Mars a very merry Christmas . " A Monday and Thursday feature by the Monitor 's columnist at large .
