Under the cover of night on April 21 , 1970 , five Miamians , calling themselves the " Eco-Commando Force ' 70 , " sneaked into six sewage-treatment plants and threw packets of yellow dye into the works . The next day half of Dade County 's canals turned bright yellow , graphically illustrating that Miami 's inadequately treated sewage does not get far from home . <P> This week , in recognition of the pertinence of such antipollution tactics , the Eco-Commandos are being declared first-prize winners of a national " ecotage " contest .
