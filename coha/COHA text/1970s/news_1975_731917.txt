" " The nation has not been torn with irresponsible reaction , " he said " Rather , we are blessed with patience , common sense and-a willingness to work things out . " The President said that the Declaration of Independence " has won @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of any revolutionary who has ever lived . " " The two lanterns of the North Church have fired a torch of freedom that has been carried to the ends of the earth , " he said . " As we launch this Bicentennial celebration , we Americans must remind ourselves of the eternal truth by which we live . We must be reinspired by the great ideals that created our country . We must renew ourselves as a people and rededicate this SHABECOFF the Redcoats were coming , Mr. Ford described his own vision of America . It was a vision that beached backward toward an earlier and simpler nation , and one that reflected sympathy for business and antipathy for government interference in the market place . In New Hampshire , politicians and newspapers viewed the President 's trip as an effort to mend his fences in that pivotal state in preparation for the 1976 so the state could be fuliy represented in Congress . Later , in a speech to a White House conference on domestic and economic affairs at a hotel a few blocks away , Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " We must reassess the archaic and rigid regulations which hamper the United States economy and directly affect the American consumer .

" After his speech , two greatgreat-great grandsons of Robert Newman , the sexton of Old North Church who carried the two lanterns to the steeple 200 years ago , lighted two new lanterns , which were then carried to the top of the steeple . Addressing a joint session of the New Hampshire Legislature in Concord in the afternoon , Mr. Ford said : " I believe it is time to reassess our domestic policies . I am convinced that the people of the United States do not know where their money is going  --  and just as important , why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand , and that the American people are paying for this in higher taxes and inflation , the President said : " It is time to re-examine not only the American budget , but the American conscience and the basic American virtues . We must get our house in order . Instead of more promises , the American people must ask who will pay'lor those promises . " Speaking in the Statehouse in Concord beneath portraits of George Washington , Abraham Lincoln and Daniel Webster , Mr. Ford asserted that the . United States Government could not go on making promises and increasing spending . " The heart of our financial dilemma , " he said , " is the endless stream of promises made to the American people in the last generation and this  --  that the Government ! can and will satisfy most of their needs and their wants . " He added , " The American people can not live on promises . We must live on production . " The joint session of the New Hampshire Legislature sat silently through most of Mr. Ford 's speech . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the deadlock over last fall 's Senate race in New Hampshire he ended he would soon ask Congress ! to legislate reforms of regula- ! tion of the transportation and ! financial industries and of the market place . He also urged a re-evaluation of " the so-called fair trade laws , " which , he said , permit manufacturers to dictate the price at which retailers must ' sell . He also said that the Government would vigorously enforce antitruct laws . But the thrust of his remarks ' was that . the Government should do less , not more , to regulate business . View Is Called Outdated " An outdated view of busi ness as the oppressor , which must be controlled by the Government , has also contributed to the failure to tackle reform , " he said . " The relationship between government and business is a relationship between government and consumer , and this must be the spirit behind re-evaluation and reform . The producers and customers in our system are not enemies , but partners . " The crowds that greeted Mr. Ford @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fairly enthusiastic . Although he said he was not here on a political trip , he got out of his limousine several times to mingle with the crowds . In his remarks at the Old North Church , the President said : " The American dream is ' not dead . It simply has yet to be fulfilled . In the economy and energy and in the environment . . . in housing and transportation .. , in education and communication . . . in social programs and social planning ? America has yet to realize its greatest contribution to civilization . " To do this , America needs new ideas and new efforts from our people . Each of us ? of every color , creed or part of the country ? must be willing to build not only a new and better nation , but new and greater understanding and unity among our people . " May it be said above all : We kept the faith ! Freedom flourished ! Liberty lived ! These are the abiding principles of our past and the greatest promise of our future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
