Once upon a time , last week in fact , a meeting was held in the august headquarters of the U.N . to hear the grievance of an Arab diplomat . He reportedly pleaded : " We ask for gasoline to be allocated for diplomats because they are in a terrible situation . " Said his loyal assistant : " We are using a lot of gas . We have to stand in line , and this is affecting our work . " <P> How true this tale was . And how initially refreshing . The gasoline lines in New York City indeed snake to the horizon . Even the natives may purchase gas only on an odd day here , an even there . Lo , how it heartened them to know that the inconvenienced diplomat was Salah Omar al-Ali , the ambassador from Iraq , he whose land has helped make oil dear as gold . <P> Alas , his plight may have fallen upon sympathetic ears . A U.N . committee will discuss letting the diplomats use a pump in the building 's basement so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natives . <P> Moral : the squeaky wheel can get the oil .
