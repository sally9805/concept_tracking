Reynold Colvin , attorney for Allan Bakke : Allan Bakke 's position is that he has a right , and that right is not to be discriminated against by reason of his race . <P> Justice John Paul Stevens : You do not dispute the basic finding that everybody admitted under the special program was qualified , do you ? <P> Colvin : We certainly do dispute it . . . The ultimate fact in this case , no matter how you turn it , is that Mr. Bakke was deprived of an opportunity to attend the school by reason of his race . This is not a matter of conjecture . This is a stipula tion by the Regents of the University of California . <P> Justice Thurgood Marshall : You are talking about your client 's rights . Do n't these underprivileged people have some rights ? <P> Colvin : They certainly have the right to . . . <P> Justice Marshall : To eat cake . <P> Colvin : They have the right to compete . The right to equal competition . <P> Justice Byron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are compelling interests , and even if there is no alternative , you believe the use of the racial classification is unconstitutional ? <P> Colvin : We do . We do not believe that intelligence , that achievement , that ability are measured by skin pigmentation . <P> <P> AGAINST <P> Harvard Law Professor Archibald Cox , representing the University of California : There are three facts , realities , which I think must control the decision of this court . The first is that the number of qualified applicants for the nation 's professional schools is vastly greater than the number of places available . <P> The second fact : for generations , racial discrimination in the U.S. isolated certain minorities and condemned them to inferior education . And then there is one third fact : there is no racially blind method of selection which will enroll today more than a trickle of minority students in the nation 's colleges and professions . <P> Justice Potter Stewart : The University of California 's admission system did put a limit on the number of white people , did n't it ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the sense that the old quota against Jews was stigmatizing . <P> Justice Stewart : Do you agree that there was a quota of 84 whites ? <P> Cox : It is not properly defined as a quota . . . It 's quite clear that for some of the things that a medical school wishes to accomplish that the minority applicant may have qualities that are superior to those of his classmate . He may be far more likely to go back to his community to practice medicine where he 's needed .
