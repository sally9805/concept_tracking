The Italian stallion is taking jabs again , only this time out of the ring . In his first film since Rocky , Sylvester Stallone , 30 , plays a union organizer during the ' 30s through ' 50s who battles politicians and corporate executives for the rights of the workingman . The title : F.I.S.T . ( Federation of Interstate Truckers ) , the union that Stallone 's character , Johnny Kovak , helps build . " Kovak came off the streets like Rocky did , " observes Sylvester . " But this guy was born to be a champion . " F.I.S.T . appealed to Stallone because of its " solid foundation . " The story , he says , " has bones . " Director Norman Jewison thinks it has another plus : a touch of that great Brando blockbuster On the Waterfront . <P> <P> Catherine Deneuve smiles for Chanel , Margaux Hemingway for Babe , and Victoria Fyodorova for Alexandra de Markoff . For the Paris house of Nina Ricci , it 's Andra de Portago . Andra Who ? Not exactly a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York actress and the daughter of the 17th Marquis de Portago , the flamboyant Spanish Grand Prix driver killed in 1957 in Italy 's Mille Miglia . While doing the disco scene one night at Manhattan 's Rgine 's , she was spotted by Nina Ricci representatives . They excitedly hired Photographer Francesco Scavullo to capture Andra 's face for the new fragrance Farouche ( meaning both " fierce " and " shy " in French ) . " I 'm very Latin and very fierce , and a little shy , " says Andra . But , claims Nina Ricci President Robert Rieci , what captivated the company was her " interesting soul . " Burbles he : " She is one of those women who have a secret splendor in their hearts . " <P> " My greatest weakness is America , " says Mare Chagall . " The people are so young and full of life . " To indulge his weakness , the artist has created a special treat : a series of stained-glass windows for the Art Institute of Chicago . The 8-ft. - high by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commemoration of Chagall 's friend the late Mayor Richard Daley . As Chagall explains : " Each window has a different theme-dance , architecture , theater , music , poetry and America . " The master , who will be 90 on July 7 , does n't mind if his symbols are n't perfectly clear to viewers . After all , says Chagall with a Gallic shrug , " Me , I do not understand Chagall . " <P> Peter Fonda started out with handle bars ; now he 's into musical bars . The easy rider makes his singing debut in the film Outlaw Blues as an ex-con-turned-songwriter who hooks up with a pretty country-and-western singer ( Susan St. James ) . Prior crooning credentials of the star include solos in the shower and a 1965 single , Chisa , that failed to make the charts . " All my life I 've wanted to be a singer , " claims Peter , 37 . Should Mick Jagger , George Harrison &; Co. start eating their hearts out ? Not according to Critic Fonda . " I think I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nobody is going to rip out my throat because of my singing . "
