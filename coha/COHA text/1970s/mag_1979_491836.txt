his remarkable story is by Wilbur Mills , the former powerful congressman , about his alcoholism . Now no one likes to admit a mistake , especially a politician . A politician is a leader , a positive thinker , confident and forthright . So when a politician goes public with his past indiscretions , he truly merits the accolades " courageous , " " unselfish , " and " gutsy . " Wilbur Mills has earned those accolades . No one I have ever known fell so far and recovered so completely and with such dignity as did Wilbur Mills . He eventually rebounded from his fall , but , instead of fading into the background as most of us would do , he chose to bare his soul in hopes of helping his fellowmen and fellow women . We are lucky to have Wilbur Mills among us . He is an inspiration to us all . Thomas P. O'Neill , Jr . Speaker , U.S. House of Representatives I have a disease .

For an alcoholic such as I am , it is well to recognize just how patient alcohol can be , because it waits around the corner . It waits for me when I become a little bit careless ; when I think that I have the problem licked ; when I think that I am cured . It waits for me to slip and take a drink . I talk about myself and my addiction primarily because I must constantly re  --  mind myself of it . I thought for a long time that alcohol did not constitute a problem for me . I did not know what al  --  cohol would do . I did not know anything about alcoholism . As I drank , I could not compare my situation to anything that I knew . I was not even aware of the fact that I had finally gotten to the point where I was not making the determination as to when to take a drink ; the alcohol was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I was drinking actually to live . And only in the last several months of my drinking did I get to the point that I had to have a drink when I worked . I never used to take a drink in the morning  --  not because I heard that alcoholics do that , but because I knew I had something to do . I would drink heavily when I had nothing to do . For years and years , if I was not occupied , or if I had a day off , I could beat the rooster in the morning tak  --  ing a drink . The rooster would crow about the time I had taken my third drink . And not once did I think that this constituted a problem . I did it because I wanted to . I took my first drink in Arkansas many years ago when I was about 11 years of age . It did not have the stamp of govern  --  ment approval on it . It was homemade stuff , called Arkansas moonshine , and it tasted terrible .

As I would come upon that still , he would recognize me , because he probably bought the sugar from my father 's store . I 'd probably helped him load it on his wagon . He would tell me to push back the scum on the top of this liquor that was about to be bottled and reach down with a cup in my hand ( up to about my elbow ) and take a drink . Then he would ask me if I liked it . What would you say to a man with a rifle on his arm who was proud of his product ? The truth was that I did not like it . And then the fellow would say , " You ca n't fly on one wing , so take another .

One desire in my whole lifetime was to go to Congress , to serve on the Ways and Means Committee , and later to become chairman of that committee . I was first elected in 1938 , went on the committee in 1942 , and finally became chairman in 1958 . I was drinking heavily in those days . It 's a strange thing , however , in that I was not a social drinker . I did n't like to go to cocktail parties in Washington . My wife Polly and I did not participate . I did n't go to embassy parties because I said that their sole purpose in having me there was to get me loaded and try to find out what I knew about our government . The truth of the matter is ( as I look back on it ) that I did n't like to go to cocktail parties because very few people at cocktail parties know how to drink . You see a woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a waiter to come by 12 times and put ice in it . I know now that I could n't find my kind of drinker at cocktail parties , so I made one like me at home . My wife did n't really like the taste of booze , but I finally succeeded in helping her acquire an addiction to it . When I got home at seven or eight o'clock , she would usually have dinner ready and ask , " Shall I serve dinner now ? " , and I would say , " No , let 's have a drink first . " As time went by , we would have four or five drinks , and dinner would have to wait a little while . I never drank when I went home to Arkansas though , because I knew that you did not drink pub  --  licly down there , and you were frowned on if any  --  body smelled it on your breath . I grew up in that environment . We had an occa  --  sional drunk in the town , however . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that expression . ) You felt sorry for him . The kids picked at him and made jokes about him , as they passed him on the street . Drunks were considered about as low down in our community as you could conceive . Nobody had any sympa  --  thy for them . They had done it them  --  selves . They had no willpower . They had no morals . If they had , they would not have drunk that way . Well , this was the way I grew up . Toward the end of my drinking , 1 got to the point where I did not want ice cubes in my glass , so I kept my booze in the icebox . I had a problem about drink  --  ing alcohol with ice cubes in the glass . What would happen if I swallowed one of those ice cubes ? I might strangle . So I was drinking it straight . When I got home , I would run back to the kitchen and pick up a bottle from the icebox and take two fast drinks . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rim . In fact , I would get mad at myself occasionally , because I would spill some of it , trying to get it so full . That was my way of drinking . I really had no problems with it . I could drink when I wanted to . I could quit drinking for months at a time , and I did . It never dawned on me that I was growing into alcoholism . I knew nothing about it . I had an operation for a slipped disk the last day of August 1973 . I had been taking some medication that relaxed the muscles in my back . It was habit forming , so , after I had my disk removed and it was Continued on following page no longer necessary for me to take that medicine , the doctor started the process of taking me off it . As I dropped from eight pills a day down to six , down to four , down to two , and to one , a strange thing hap  --  pened , however . My consumption of alcohol went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good-sized drinks at night and go to sleep , now it was necessary for me to drink a bottle or more . I was not aware of the multiplying effect that habit-forming drugs have on alcohol . During some 54 years from when I took my first drink to when I took my last , I was not aware of any progression of my drinking at all . The last two years of my drinking , as I look back on them , were living hell . Not because I took my swinging people with me everywhere I went , not because I got the name of the Tidal Basin changed , not because they named the theater in Boston The Mills House of Sin  --  not be  --  cause these things happened , but for other reasons . I was drinking very heavily . In 1974 , I was finally find  --  ing it necessary to take a drink in the morning before I could shave . Do you know that it is possible to cut your face with an electric razor ? I learned how to do it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the mirror . I did not know what I would see . I heard others say that they looked into the mirror at their own eyes and saw nothing . I am sure that would have been the case if I had looked . But I had become an alcohol  --  ic and did n't know it . About this time , President Ford vetoed a bill in which 1 had an interest . I thought he was misadvised , so on Tues  --  day ( after I had been to Bos ton on that infamous weekend ) , I moved to override the President 's veto . The House did not do it . After the vote , some of my colleagues came to me for coun  --  sel . This is a time that I ca n't remember at all . Charlie Bennett of Florida was the first to come , and I under  --  stand that a half dozen or more joined him . They were embarrassed by my getting up before them and asking them to join me , a drunk , in overriding the veto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They were embarrassed about it . I was not , not a bit . I did not know what I had done . I did not remember going to Boston . I did not even remember being in Boston . This was a Tuesday morning , and I did n't remember what I did on Monday . But at any rate I was there . They came to me and said , " Wilbur , you look like you 're sick . " All of this they have told me since then . I said , " I 'm not just sick ; I 'm dying . " ( I knew I was dying , and I had known it for some time . I had made up my mind that I had a very short time to live . Maybe that caused me to drink more , know  --  ing that I was not going to live . Maybe I was enjoying what I was doing . They tell me that if you think you are enjoying it , you probably are . I do n't know if I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that was that I was dying . ) When I said I was dying , they kept telling me that other members of the committee could handle it , that there was no need for me to get overexcited . I knew good and well that , even if I trained the members of that committee , they could still not do the work as well as I could . One of the great things about alcoholics is that we are great con artists . This is especially true of us who become alcoholic while we are in politics . It is neces  --  sary that we always cover up from those we ask to be our supporters . I would never let anybody know of the egotism that existed within myself . I knew that none of the other members of the committee could handle legislation as well as I could . Why ? Because God himself , so many times , had asked me to take His place on the throne . And during the time that He allowed me to remain there the world was free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but when I was running it . We had our working relationship ; yes , we did . I occupied a position in that partnership superior to His , I thought . But here in the rear of the House Chamber they told me that I needed a doctor . Finally , they called Dr. Carey from the dispensary , who rushed right over . " You have a high pulse rate , and you 've got to go to the hospital , " he said . Now , as I look back on it , I know that I was blacked out or he would never have gotten me to the hospital . My wife Polly had taken me to the hospital many times ; I would come to at two or three o'clock in the morning , however , and have them take me home . Dr. Lukash , who was in the White House ( President Ford 's doctor and also Presi  --  dent Carter 's doctor ) , had examined me on several occa  --  sions . I do n't know if they acknowledged what was really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and peritonitis at the same time except in alcoholism , and they treated me for two weeks in the hospital in February 1974 for hepatitis and peritonitis . They told me not to take a drink for 90 days . That I did . I had no trouble not taking a drink because I could look toward that 91st day , when I would spend on alcohol all the money that I had saved during the 90 days . On the 91st day , I threw a big one . This time I was not aware of being in the hospital for some time . I do n't know how long . The doctor took blood . He knew what was wrong with me . It was very easy to tell . Librium and alcohol had taken the place of my blood . He came into my room one day and asked , " Do you know what is wrong with you ? " I responded : " Sure , I know what 's wrong with me . Any doctor who 's worth his salt knows that tumors of the brain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  outs . Any doctor who 's worth his salt knows that when you lose as much weight as I 've lost , the tumor must be malignant . I have a malignant tumor of the brain . If you want to find it , okay . I have n't long to live . " He looked at me and said : " That 's not your problem . Your problem is that you are an alcoholic . " Now , can you imagine a lieutenant commander in the Navy , expecting to be a captain some day , telling an important member of Congress that he was an alco  --  holic  --  a presidential candidate who did n't want to be an alcoholic , who had no intention of being an alco Continued on page 114 My Life on the Rocks Continued from page 32 holic , who had willpower and every  --  thing else that goes contrary to being an alcoholic ? This little numbskull told me I was an alcoholic . And then to add in  --  sult to insult , he said that I was a chron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Fortunately for him , as I 've told him so many times since then when we 've had dinner together , he had the obvious facts on his side . We are the best of friends now , but we were mortal enemies then . I 've told him many times he insulted me . He downgraded me be  --  cause of my concept of what an alcohol  --  ic was . I thought that an alcoholic was the lowest thing that God had ever let live . I knew that , because I 'd seen them on Ninth Street in Washington . I 'd seen them in the Bowery . People that did n't desire to do anything but drink . No morals , no willpower . He made me , in my opinion , one of those , and I hated him . One day he called in Senator Harold Hughes , a recovering alcoholic , to try to tell me that it was possible for alcohol itself to cause you to black out . I did n't believe it . Senator Hughes told me about a three-week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a hotel in San Francisco . He did n't know where he was and had nothing in the room but a half case of whiskey when he came to . He called the bellboy and asked him where he was . The bellboy told him the name of the hotel . He said , " I do n't want the name of a hotel ; I want to know what city I 'm in . " To this day , there are still questions in his mind . " How did I get there ? Did I kill any  --  body on the way ? Did I rob any bus  --  iness on the way ? " I said , " Well , fine , senator ; I can understand your having a blackout from liquor , but my problem is caused by a malignant tumor of the brain . " About that time , my doctor was con  --  ducting some experiments . They flew a very expensive piece of equipment from the San Diego Naval Hospital into Wash  --  ington . It would show my brain on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tending from it . I told them they had the machine on the wrong side of my head . They turned me over and took the picture from the other side . I did n't know it , but this miracle X-ray machine was showing all sides of my brain at the same time . I could n't see anything . I knew then that the Congress had wasted money when it bought a machine like that which would n't show a tumor when one was there . You have no conception of how hard-headed , how bull-headed , how stubborn I was . I was determined that I was not going to be an alcoholic . I could Continued on following page // hold onto my self-created diagnosis . I could justify my illness on the basis of something other than alcohol . I could n't be an alcoholic . I left the hospital after they came in , six of them , all dressed in white uniforms , smiles on their faces to tell me that they had good news . I said : " Gentlemen , tell me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Is it a month , six weeks , two months ? " I knew I could n't live longer than two months . They reas  --  sured me , ' There 's not a thing in the world organically wrong with your brain ; not a thing . ' You do n't know how offended I was . I knew good and well that these socialized doctors who were not being paid by the patient but by the federal government could n't do the job anyway . So I asked the orderly to get me my clothes . They wanted to know where I was going . I told them I was going to Little Rock to a hospital where doctors really under  --  stood their patients , where they could find that tumor . But I could n't even get up out of the bed . In time , I felt too good to be an alcoholic . I had n't had a drink in 60 or 70 days by then . I went back to the apartment . I was going to go to work . They had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our apart  --  ment building . Nosey people came in with lots of " do-gooder " stories . " If you do n't take a drink , you can look like I look . " " All you have to do is go a day at a time without taking a drink . " " Just bear in mind that it 's the first drink that gets you drunk . " They did n't know me . I would n't pass out on less than a bottle . I mean black out . I had heard all this stuff before . Some  --  where along the line I heard a very cogent remark that stayed with me . It is very simply this : " If you can take a drink and do n't have to have another one , in all probability you are not an alcoholic . If , however , you take one drztlt and feel the urge to take another drink , you may be an alcoholic . " Never once in my lifetime had I ever had the desire to take a drink . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drinks in order for any obses  --  sion to set in . I decided to test this theo  --  ry . I bought two quart bottles of 100-proof vodka to take one drink . I had to have that one drink . As I look back on it , that 's nothing in the world but alcoholic insanity . Why in the world , when I was committing myself to take one drink , would I buy so much ? I 've learned a lot since I 've been sober . I 've learned that I was an alcoholic , not a recovering alcoholic . I did n't realize I was an alcoholic until I was sober . I went home with those two bottles and hid one of them . I had never done that before . Polly had n't had a drink in 22 months or more . Maybe I did n't want her to be tempted . In any event , she says that I drank it . But by then I did n't know . Five minutes after I took that first drink , I had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a test I knew I could not fail . I knew I could win it . I was going to show these people who go out to the bar stools and take drunks into their organization that they did n't know their business . They were n't going to build up their member  --  ship and take credit for saving my soul . I was going to show these people , plus that incompetent doctor , who inciden  --  tally is now a captain , that I was n't an alcoholic . I was going to show them . But my test failed . Not only did it fail , it backfired on me . In 24 hours I was back in the hospital . I was a traveling drunk . I once went to New York in a private plane . A mem  --  ber of Alcoholics Anonymous came af  --  ter me and finally located me in the Waldorf Astoria . All those hotels up there , but they finally found me . And , you know , coming back on the plane , that fellow from A.A. got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told them when I got back . I thought that was the truth ; I believed it . When they wanted to know why I got drunk , I said , " That fellow you sent for me got me drunk . " I was back in the hospital , and this nosey guy and the doctor were at the foot of the bed . Now , if you ever make a call on a drunk who 's just sobering up in the hospital , do n't go in there with a smile on your face . Please , do n't go in smiling , because he 's dying . He thinks so at least . I knew I was dying . I had to get out of that hospital , because it had been my experience that naval hospitals do n't serve alcohol . I wanted a drink , and I was shaking . The doctor asked me what I was , and I finally admitted , " Well , I guess I 'm an alcoholic . " " You guess ? " he asked . " If it will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an alcoholic , " I responded . " It 's not me that needs help ; I want you to admit it to yourself , " he admonished . I did ad  --  mit it to myself . Now , I think I 'm very for  --  tunate . To begin with , no hu  --  man being got me sober . There were 36 of us at the naval hospital who were ad  --  dicted to alcoholism . I was picked out of those 36 to receive a gift , a very sacred gift , a gift from God . My so  --  briety comes as a gift from God . My ability to stay so  --  ber , and the fact that I have stayed sober for many months , is due to God through other people . The fact that I 've done what they told me to do , that I 've tried to be comfortable , that I 've tried to be happy in my so  --  briety , is a credit to others . My attitude about alcohol  --  ism and about the alcoholic has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occa  --  sions to go to an alcoholic center in Washington just to be around a person who 's shaking , who 's coming out from under a drunk . What there is about it I do n't know , but I 'm not comforta  --  ble if I go too long without being around somebody like that . I see some  --  body like I was . He 's full of questions , as I was full of questions . I wonder how many people out there still drinking do not know that alcoholism is a disease ? How many of them know that it is a treatable disease ( not incurable , like that which struck my good friend Hubert Humphrey , who did indeed show us how to die ) ? And , on top of that , how many of them know that the world they create , that world of fantasy from the bottle , is nothing compared to the world of reality when one is sober ? So far as comfort , so far as pleasure , so far as happiness is con  --  cerned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that person that , if he is a victim of alcohol , he has a disease . It is nothing to be ashamed of . Fs ,
