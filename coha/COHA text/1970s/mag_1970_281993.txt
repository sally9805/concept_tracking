Oilmen are fast discovering that pollution can not be dismissed as the price of progress . In the toughest federal action ever brought against a polluter , a grand jury in New Orleans last week indicted the Chevron Oil Co. on a 900-count criminal charge of having " knowingly and wilfully " failed to provide safety devices on 90 wells in the Gulf of Mexico off the Louisiana coastline . <P> If convicted , Chevron faces a possible fine of $2,000 a day for each well for ten days of violations . The total fines could reach $1,800,000 . <P> " We are confident that when the case is tried , we will be completely vindicated , " says Chevron President K.H. Shaffer . The very fact that the case has been brought has already vindicated U.S. Interior Secretary Walter J. Hickel . Although often accused by environmentalists of being soft on industry , Hickel was outraged last March 10 when he learned about a massive oil leak at a Chevron offshore platform . It was not only the 4,000 barrels a day gushing into the Gulf that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industry could live in harmony with the environment . <P> The Very Guy . After flying to the scene , Hickel concluded that the leak was caused by violations of federal regulations laid down in the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act of 1953 , which he himself had toughened in 1969 . Hickel charged that Chevron had failed to equip some wells with required " chokes , " which automatically shut off runaway oil ; the oilmen were presumably mindful that the safety devices can become clogged with ' sand and reduce the flow of crude . The Secretary later boasted that he had found " the guy , the very guy " who had lifted the choke from one offending well . Hickel also asked the U.S. Geological Survey to check other offshore wells in the Gulf . Result : of 3,400 wells examined , 300 violated federal requirements . Those offenders , too , face possible court action . <P> The Chevron case may reverberate in Washington for other reasons . In his crusade against polluters , Hickel has often seemed to ignore the Nixon Administration 's " Southern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state that derives about 40% of its revenues from oil drilling , petitioned the Secretary to be lenient with the oil companies-in vain . Hickel has also temporarily blocked construction of a West German chemical plant in South Carolina , and the controversial jetport near the Everglades National Park in Florida . In every instance , Hickel justifies his action as he did last week in speaking of the oil incidents : " We will be fair . But we will be tough . The future of our environment is at stake .
