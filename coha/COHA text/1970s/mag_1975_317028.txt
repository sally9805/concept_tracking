A cruel trick of geography has wedged Laos , a land of 3 million delicate , gentle and innately pacific people , between powerful and antagonistic neighbors . With the Communist takeover of Cambodia and South Viet Nam , it is probably only a matter of time before Laos becomes the next Indochina state to fall to the Communists . Anticipating this , wealthy Laotians , Chinese and Vietnamese have already begun departing Laos in great numbers ; planes are booked solidly , and scores of autos have lined up at the Vientiane ferry , waiting to cross the Mekong River into Thailand . <P> On the Brink . At week 's end a takeover by the Communist-led Pathet Lao seemed even more certain . The year-old coalition government teetered on the brink of collapse as five pro-American Cabinet members resigned their posts , leaving the Cabinet virtually in the hands of the Communists . The immediate reason for the resignations was the mounting pressure against the right from leftist student and labor groups . More basic , however , has been the right 's increasing sense of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was supposed to divide power equally between the two factions - work almost solely to the advantage of the Pathet Lao . Ailing Prince Souvanna Phouma , the 73-year-old neutralist Premier , has consistently pressured the demoralized and leaderless rightists into accepting the demands of the Pathet Lao Cabinet members . Last summer , for example , the rightist-dominated National Assembly was suspended and later formally dissolved because some of its members had called for the withdrawal of North Vietnamese troops from Laos . <P> Laos ' de facto legislature has been the Joint National Political Council , headed by the dynamic titular head of the Pathet Lao , " Red Prince " Souphanouvong , 62 , who is Souvanna 's half brother . Leftists in the Vientiane government have been steadily tightening their control of key ministries ( such as Information and Foreign Affairs ) and have triggered disruptive strikes by teachers , police and municipal employees . <P> Last week terror was added to the growing pressure from the left ; an unidentified assailant tossed a hand grenade into a car full of rightist politicians and Chinese businessmen . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Om , brother of the warlord of southern Laos , whose name is Boun Oum , and uncle of Sisouk na Champassak , the powerful Minister of Defense , who was among those that resigned . It was the first assassination of a rightist political figure since the ceasefire , and has unsettled many leading rightists . They now fear for their own and their families ' safety ; Boun Oum has reportedly gone into hiding somewhere in his fief .
