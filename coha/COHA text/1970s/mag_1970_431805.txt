 | A Saturday morning in Davenport , Iowa . The Leisz family , new in town , was stirring into wakefulness . In the kitchen Kathleen Leisz was busy with breakfast ; her husband , Stuart , recently returned from a week of business travel , was still in bed upstairs . " Be sure to come right back , Mary Jo , " Mrs. Leisz called to her ten-year-old daughter as she skipped out the door to meet a playmate . It seemed only a moment passed before the playmate rushed into the house , sobbing , " Mary Jo 's been hurt . A car hit her ! " In a flash , Stu Leisz was up and dressed and racing up the street where Mary Jo lay crumpled in a heap , surrounded by children and a dazed motorist . By the time Kathleen arrived in the family car an ambulance was on the scene . Stu Leisz helped lift his daughter and rode with her to the hospital . " All I could think of , " he now says , " was , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't even know a doctor in this town ! " At the hospital 's emergency room there was no physician in sight ; most of the medical men , it turned out , were at a local ball game . The stricken parents stood beside their daughter , who lay on a stretcher unconscious and bleeding , with street gravel still embedded in her face , while a nurse dialed phone numbers . " It was one of the worst moments of our lives , Stuart Leisz says . " When the nurse finally got hold of a doctor , he told us that he believed Mary Jo had a fractured skull and concussion with possible internal bleeding , but that it was against hospital regulations to recommend a physician . They handed us a list of names and said , You pick one . ' " Mary Jo recovered completely but it taught the Leiszes a lesson they 'll never forget : " Do n't move into a new town until you 've found out about the hospitals and doctors . " Moving has become such an important part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million families find themselves changing towns . Couples faced with company moves brought about by a husband 's transfer or a new job offer would do well to lend an ear to advice from the Leiszes . Members of the new " migrant middle class , " 39-year-old Kathleen Leisz and her 40-year-old husband , Stuart , have trekked up and down the Mississippi River from Minnesota to the Gulf of Mexico , crisscrossed the continent from Alabama to Texas , Colorado 's Rockies and the Pacific Northwest . They have lived in the Deep South and in the heart of the Middle West . " Home " has been an upstairs apartment , a rented bungalow , a one-time church , and a converted chicken coop . At various times they have been jobless , or torn by the stress of forced separations , or buffeted by the shrieking fury of a Gulf Coast hurricane . But they also have vacationed in Florida and Mexico , explored the magnificent slopes of Pikes Peak and Mount Rainier , listened to jazz on New Orleans ' Bourbon Street and played golf on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they have also learned about all there is to learn about family moving . Most recently , they managed a 1,300-mile jump from New Orleans to Minneapolis within one weekend so that the children would miss only one day of school . Such proficiency is no accident ; in 16 years the Leiszes and their children have moved 12 times . Their story ? the  | story of Stuart 's sometimes-torturous climb up the executive ladder and Kathleen 's efforts to keep home fires burning wherever home may happen to be ? is No. 3 in Good Housekeeping 's continuing series on interesting people in changing patterns of living . You get a clue to the Leiszes ' survival when you meet Stuart and Kathleen . Although mobile executives are sometimes accused of being aloof and coolly ambitious , there 's nothing stuffy or uninvolved about Stu Leisz . He is a sales director of Cargill , Inc. , a company that produces agricultural products and ranks as one of the nation 's leading exporters of grains . Stocky and ruggedly built , Stu is outgoing and informal . In college @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ director and he still has the keen-eyed , alert stance of a coach . He strikes you as a man who 's never more at ease than when he has a flock of children climbing all over him . At any moment you expect him to yank a whistle out of his pocket and bark , " Line Up ! " or , " Play Ball ! " He approaches life as he did college football ? with a " let-me-at-'em " enthusiasm and energy . After a high-pressure week of work , in his office or shuttling by jet airliner through half a dozen cities , he spends his Saturdays playing handball or shepherding groups of schoolboys on cross country hikes . His wife , Kathleen , provides the perfect counterbalance . A slim blonde , Mrs. Leisz is calm , patient , soft-spoken . Although she 's happiest when at home , she 's also not adverse to change . " There must be some gypsy in me , " she thinks . They met 20 years ago as sophomores at the University of Minnesota and were married the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Stu 's family home in Minneapolis . While Kathleen concentrated on babies and homemaking , Stu got through college on an ROTC scholarship and an assortment of after-school summer jobs . When he posed for his graduation pictures , he was holding his son , Dennis , and his baby daughter , Mary Jo . When Stu undertook to fulfill his ROTC commission which called for active service as an Army officer , Kathleen was introduced to the uncertain pleasures of mobile family life . It was then she came to the conclusion which she holds to this day : " It can be awful at first but if you hang on it 's bound to improve . " In August , 1954 , the Leiszes found themselves with two babies in Fort Sill , Okla. , battling an indoor invasion of cockroaches and an outdoor plague of insects so thick that they were being removed from the streets and lawns by the truckload . Later , Army assignments took them from Texas and Alabama to Wisconsin , Colorado and the Pacific Northwest . Sometimes they were lucky enough to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember an air base near San Antonio , Texas . where " all we could find to live in was a converted chicken coop with a space heater in the center of the room and an overhead fan for ventilation . " " We spent our Christmas that year , " says Kathleen , " with the temperature up around 95 degrees and that old twister fan stirring up the heat waves . Believe me , it did n't seem much like Christmas to a family from Minnesota ! " Yet she and her husband both look back on those Army days with some of the fondest memories of their married life . " We were in the midst of a lot of other young couples , " Kathleen says . " We all were earning about the same amount of money and most of us had babies or young children . There were lots of parties but no one fussed about them , so you did n't have to worry about baby-sitters or getting dressed up . You just had people in , and their kids and your kids played @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loads of friends and we managed to save more money than we ever have since . " By the time his Army discharge was  | in sight , Stu had become a first lieutenant and an aviator , and was earning about $8,000 a year . But his hopes for a career as a civilian airline pilot were dashed when he discovered that the airlines , midway in shifting from propellor to jet planes , were not looking for pilots with his experience . Back in Minneapolis , he found a job as a junior salesman at Cargill and was assigned to the company 's Davenport , Iowa , office at a starting annual salary of $5,100 . Although that was a far cry from his Army pay and involved moving again , Stu and Kathleen Leisz did n't hesitate . " All those Army moves had conditioned us to shifting our mental gears in a hurry , " Kathleen says . " That 's awfully important if you 're going to be a mobile family . " Davenport was destined to be but one more temporary address for the Leisz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place where they made the biggest mistake a family on the move can make . That mistake taught them this lesson : " If you have young children , pick a new neighborhood . " " After renting for a while at $110 a month we found and bought a nice house in one of the older , well-established parts of town , " Stu Leisz explains . " In the Army Kathleen and I had been so used to making new friends easily that we assumed it would be the same in civilian life . It was n't . Most of our Davenport neighbors had lived there a long time and were old enough to be our parents and had their own circle of friends . We just did n't have things in common with them that we 'd have had in a new neighborhood , where couples are younger , the children are younger and lots of other families have also just arrived . " The friendship of other new-intown people is very important . You all share the experience of being newcomers , including the strain of being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new enough area , you 're bound to be invited by the neighbors to cookouts or cocktails or brunch and the first thing you know you 're meeting couples who come from all parts of the country ? but who have the same adjustments to make that you do . " The key to making a go of migrant living , the Leiszes maintain , is for both husband and wife to understand how important it is for the woman to be happy in her new home . A husband 's success in business , even his very marriage , often depends on recognition of this basic fact . For many housewives , daily contact with other women is a necessity . " You can imagine what happens , " says Kathleen Leisz , " when a young woman who 's been used to having friends and relatives on call suddenly finds herself alone in a strange town , with only her children and her four walls as company . Her husband is all charged up with the challenge of a new job and is out all day long , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there seems to be only monotony , loneliness and frustration . That 's why it 's so important to move into a neighborhood where everybody 's on the same spot . It 's hard enough to find your way around strange streets and stores , but if , in addition , your neighbors make you feel like a fifth wheel , you 're likely to fling up your hands and scream , This is for the birds ! No raise is worth this kind of life . ' " Psychiatrists and psychologists would agree . In recent years they 've been discovering that " career moves , " like the Leiszes , can have devastating effects on family morale . When a wife begins to feel abandoned , the necessity of carrying on the old routines of family life may well arouse intense inner rage and frustration . If these emotions are repressed , there may be attacks of anxiety and depression , accompanied by headaches , weeping , irritability , insomnia and digestive upsets . As for the plight of their husbands , Stu Leisz comments : " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with an unhappy wife is eventually going to hit the skids in his new job . The problems at home can be enough to force him to give up his career and move his family back where they came from . I 'd say that if a wife has n't made new friendships within six months after a move , look out ! " Besides congenial neighbors , a new suburb offers moving families other important advantages , such as instant creature comforts . In new developments , the homes are usually equipped with modern housekeeping appliances , wall-towall carpeting and even draperies . When a family is moving up the corporate ladder Dad 's likely to be transferred about every three years , so there 's little time and less inclination for remodeling and modernizing . " The fellow who is tackling a new job and the wife who is finding her way in a new community , " Stuart Leisz says , " should n't be bogged down with fixing up a place they 'll soon be leaving . With a newer house all you do is turn the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days many companies give the wife of a man who is being transferred at least one all-expense-paid trip to their new location to find a place to live . But , the Leiszes emphasize , this expedition should be approached with caution . " A lot of couples , " Kathleen says , " think , Oh boy , a whole week by ourselves ! It 's going to be great ? just like a second honeymoon ! ' Instead , they 're run ragged by real estate agents and end up arguing all week about what he likes and she likes until they 're worn to a frazzle . " Her advice : " Wait until you get back home and cool off before you reach a decision . " The Leiszes had assumed that if Stu made good as a salesman with Cargill , their next move might be toward Chicago , a great center for grain companies . Instead , Cargill , which was then beginning to expand its salt business and had acquired a salt mine in Louisiana , offered Stu the job of district sales manager @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raise of several thousand dollars and they promptly set about preparing to move . But again they made a major mistake , from which they learned another important lesson : " Do n't hang on to your old house ! " Soon after they placed their Davenport home on the market , they were offered a price that was slightly below the figure they had wanted . Confident that other and better offers would be forthcoming , they turned the first one  | down . As weeks and then months rolled by , they realized how mistaken they 'd been . " If you have an important move coming up and the price you 're offered for your house is even close to what you want , you 'd better take it , " says Stu Leisz . " Until we sold that house in Davenport , we could n't buy another in Baton Rouge . And we just did n't have the money to move the family down to a rented house while we were carrying our Davenport place . " The result was that Stu found himself living in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , trying to cope with two children in grade school , a new baby , and not being able to see her husband except on an occasional weekend . " Everything went wrong with that move , " says Stu . " First , I was so gung ho to get started with the new job that I jumped in the only car we had and drove it down to New Orleans . I had expected a quick sale on the house and thought Kathleen would be moving right down . Instead , she was stranded by herself without a car and in a couple of weeks she was fit to be tied . I had to fly back to Davenport and arrange to buy a second-hand car for her . But then I had to leave her again and go back to Louisiana . It was the loneliest period of our lives . I was traveling most of the time , spending all day talking to strangers in strange towns , eating alone and spending the evenings and weekends alone . I saw more high school ball games than I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " You find yourself doing spooky things : Once in some little town in Georgia I found myself in the middle of a crowd that was protesting the score in some basketball game . Guys started yelling and shoving and throwing punches . Suddenly I thought to myself , For Pete 's sake , Leisz , what are you doing in this fight in the middle of the night ? You do n't even know the names of the teams ! If you get flattened or grabbed by the cops , you 'll never be able to explain it . ' " Back in Iowa , Kathleen Leisz was feeling just as unlike herself and was beginning to be convinced the Davenport house was a jinx that would never be sold . There still were no offers and on top of that , she was pregnant again . " Kathleen is the kind of girl who hates to admit life is getting her down , " says Stu Leisz . " When I 'd call her she 'd chat away as if everything was fine , to keep me from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our minds and that I 'd better do something . So I flew home , closed the house , and drove Kathleen and the kids to my folks in Minneapolis . Fortunately , they have a lot of room , so I could leave my gang with them until we sold our Davenport place . " Nearly six months passed before they finally got out from under . In the end they sold their Davenport house for less than they 'd paid for it . The family moved south to Baton Rouge as soon as the Minneapolis schools closed for the summer . This was still another mistake . The lesson : " Do n't move kids in June . " " It may be hard to believe , " says Kathleen , " but we 've found that it 's not such a great idea to wait to move until school is out . That seems to make it harder on the children . They know they 're going to move , so they 're distracted in school anyway . And then . you reach your new town during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends . It may turn out to be a lonely time for them . At least if they start in their new school in spring , they get to know some of the children . " The move from Davenport ? via Minneapolis and coming after the long separation ? continued to add to the woes of the family and their beginnings in Louisiana were far from rosy . What the Leiszes learned : " Be prepared for your new climate ! " " That summer , " Kathleen remembers . " was the longest , hottest , nastiest summer we 'd ever known . We were living in a rented house that was n't air-conditioned and it was so hot nobody would come to see us until after sunset Stu had started in Louisiana during the winter , so he did n't really understand the climate . I was pregnant with Barbara and there 's nothing worse than  | being sticky , hot and pregnant at the same time . And then everything in the house ? the children 's shoes and all of our clothes , began to mildew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not only keeps it cool , but controls humidity and dampness . Some nights all we could do was pile everybody into Stu 's air-conditioned company car and ride around with the windows rolled up and cool off and dry out . But we survived . The new baby was born four days after we got into the new house we 'd been building and you can believe that house was air-conditioned ! " Life in Louisiana , which began on such an uncertain note , soon improved . For Dennis , the eldest of the Leisz children who was then an outdoor-loving , sports-minded boy of ten , it turned out to be a paradise . " You might say he began by striking up an acquaintance with one of the boys down the street , " says Stu . " The kid called Dennis a good-for-nothing , low-down damn Yankee . ' Dennis hauled off and punched him in the stomach . From then on they were pals . Dennis had it made . " He would go off with his friends on bikes exploring the bayous , woods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terrific place for snakes , " says Dennis ) , catching turtles , trapping flying squirrels . He learned to waterski on the river , started building model airplanes , launched his career in football by making the fourth-grade team . It 's not surprising that when his father 's next transfer ( and promotion ) came along , Dennis was n't happy . His mother , good trouper that she is , took the news in her stride , but she admits the timing was n't to her liking . " It comes hard to have to pull up stakes just after school has opened and you 've got the kids in classes and bought the books . " This time the family 's destination was New Orleans , where Stu had been put in charge of a new and enlarged regional office . Now they knew enough to steer clear of the old established neighborhoods and head for a brandnew suburb . Once more they contracted to build a house . Meantime they rented a furnished bungalow and kept their belongings in storage . " It 's a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kathleen explains . " Usually when you 're transferred your company will pay for only one move . If we 'd moved our things into an unfurnished place and let the company pay for that , we 'd have had to foot the bill when we were ready to move into our own house . " Once in New Orleans , the children set about making friends , with Dennis promptly deciding the place was " better than Baton Rouge . " That fall , they found themselves in the path of a hurricane and spent a long terrifying night nailing emergency wall braces into new wall-to-wall carpeting . But next morning , characteristically , they converted their bad luck into good . " Our new house happened to have the only gas stove in the neighborhood , " explains Kathleen . " Since the electricity was out , we invited everyone to come in and use our stove to cook or boil water . Stu spent the clay making batches of pancakes and pots of coffee . By evening we knew everyone in town . " Kathleen came to love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she says , " living in Louisiana was like a three-year vacation . When you have as many youngsters as I do , warm weather means lots less work . No snowsuits and boots and all that . Then , too , people are really much more relaxed in the South than the North . I loved their style of life . " Kathleen also was delighted with their occasional encounters with New Orleans night life ? particularly on Bourbon Street where jazz had its beginnings and where some of the nation 's best music is still to be heard . There was also the Mardi Gras ? its parades and balls and air of festivity . " And the marvelous food ! " Kathleen says , " I love cooking . New Orleans is one place where people know how to turn out gourmet dishes and really care about good eating . " girls she met seemed so cliquey . She confesses now that at one point she even thought of taking her baby-sitting money and hopping a train for the South . But predictably , she recovered fast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Dennis began to make places for themselves , as always . Adding to the family 's enjoyment was a neighborhood recreation center with tennis courts and swimming pool that was open all year round . The Leiszes put this close to the top of their list of things that can make life better for mobile families . Two years ago the family 's 16-year migration paid off ? and very happily . Cargill offered Stu a chance to return to Minneapolis as head of its salt division ? and at a walloping increase in salary . Naturally , Stu and Kathleen were overjoyed . Minneapolis , where they 'd grown up , was home for them . Even though they 'd learned how to handle and accept the migrant life , the prospect of returning home ? and possibly staying there ? was too good to be true . And so they packed up their belongings and moved North . In a remarkably short time , they 'd bought a house in the Minneapolis suburb where Cargill has its headquarters , and had settled in . If there was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact that their two eldest children , Dennis and Mary Jo , clearly did n't show their enthusiasm . Both were gloomy and lonesome that first summer in Minnesota : Dennis brooding about the New Orleans girl he 'd had to break up with ; Mary Jo feeling like an outsider because the Looking back over the years , their mother thinks that the family 's migration has actually helped the children in many ways . " It 's not only that they 've had a chance to see so many parts of America , " Kathleen says , " but they 've learned how to get along with people . Dennis was in three kindergartens , two third grades , two sixth grades . Maybe that 's why he seems able to hit it off with people wherever he is . When you 're always on the move , you ca n't become complacent about friends . You have to keep working at making and keeping them . " These days , with Stu making upwards of $20,000 a year , with the maple crib that 's traveled more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diapers for the first time in nearly 17 years , Stu and Kathleen are reveling in having time to enjoy life and the wherewithal to do it . Last winter they took their first vacation trip alone together since college days : a company sales winners ' trip to the Bahamas . Another move to another city or another part of America is still not out of the question . Meanwhile , all the Leiszes are thriving . The younger children ? there are still four under ten ? can now partake of snowball fights and winter sleigh rides and all of Minnesota 's other winter pleasures . For Stu there 's baseball with the Minnesota Twins , football , hockey . He 's finding that living costs more than it used to ( inflation , high local property taxes , the cost of outfitting a big family for Minnesota winters ) , but he knows he 's doing well and he 's proud of his family for the great way they helped him get there . As for Kathleen , she 's finding time for herself at last . These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kitchen table , soaking up the beauty of what she sees through her windows and writing notes to her many friends all over the nation . For all of them and for those who are now stationed overseas her message is the same : " Now I know that things really do work out for the best ! "
