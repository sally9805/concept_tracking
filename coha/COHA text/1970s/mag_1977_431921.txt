 | Europe 's Sizzling Summer @# IN FRANCE , panicky farmers killed off tens of thousands of dairy cows when pastures turned to dust bowls . In England , usually a gardener 's paradise of wet weather , citizens were fined for watering flowers , and a few umbrella makers went bankrupt . The mighty Danube and Rhine rivers shrank so much that barges carried half loads to avoid scraping bottom . Swiss firemen turned their hoses on wheat fields roasting under a merciless sun . It happened last summer , when the weather went haywire and trapped Western Europe in an African-style drought , from Portugal across to Italy and up to Britain . Not in 250 years had such lands as Wales , southern England , northern France and Belgium been as dry . Water was rationed to more than  | a million people . At Neufchateau , Belgium , families brought buckets to cistern trucks to get their drinking water . In Vigo , Spain , a city of a quarter million people , all water supplies were cut off up to 15 hours daily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ river anywhere . The Alps-fed Po trickled by the Italian town of Pontelagoscuro 20.6 feet below the normal level on an official gauge . Britons were warned against swimming in rivers because industrial pollutants were not being washed away . France closed 340 miles of canals as unfit for navigation . Lowered reservoirs forced electric-power reductions there , and 9o-minute daily cutoffs of current in Portugal . The drought was a disaster for farming . No rain fell during June , the key growing month , and sugar beets in central Germany stretched so far to find moisture that they looked like carrots . In July , farmers in the western part of Spain 's Valencia Province stared sullenly at stalks of wasted wheat that should have been up to their waists but were only hand-high , and the drought gave Britain its worst grain harvest in six years . France 's vital dairy industry was ravaged for lack of fodder , and President Valery Giscard d'Estaing declared a " national calamity . " The drought began for most of the seriously affected areas in Europe with the exceptionally dry summer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 1976 , most of Western Europe received only half ? parts of England and Wales only a third ? of average precipitation . While experts differ about long-term causes of climatic changes , nearly all agree that the main reason for last summer 's record heat and dryness was a freak anti-cyclone , or high-pressure zone . The hot , dry air of such a zone generally extends eastward from the Azores to cover the Sahara in summer . Inexplicably , this zone wandered north and stuck fast on Europe in early June . The result was a tremendous traffic jam in air circulation . Rainbearing westerly winds could not penetrate the anti-cyclone , and detoured south into the Mediterranean and north across Scotland to Finland , Poland and Russia , producing Moscow 's heaviest summer rainfall in a century . It is exceptional for such a zone to stay put for two weeks . This one clung to south Britain and northwest France a full three months . In mid-June , a month-long heat wave speeded up evaporation of wa ter supplies . For 13 straight nights i was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Three hundred an ten miles of German highways we closed because the heat had buckle road surfaces . London 's official record high 950 would actually have meant reli for the 374 tennis players competi at Wimbledon , where the sun se center-court temperatures as high 112 . In such heat , rigid British trad tions melted away . At the Hen ! Royal ' Regatta , blazers could be r moved in the exclusive Steward '  | Enclosure for the first time ever . Thirst , of course , was unquenchable . Brewers and soft-drink manufacturers worked double time . Some British pubs failed to foresee the run on their supplies and ran dry . When a truck delivered an overdue order of mineral water to one Paris grocer , a crowd snapped up all 2000 bottles within an hour . Archeologists , at least , welcomed the drought . Buried pits and ditches of ages past retained enough moisture , when all else around was dry , to sprout grassy traces of ancient construction ? easily spotted from planes . This way , remains of farmhouses 2500 years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ west of France . The outline of a huge Roman legionary camp came to light in Shropshire , England , while around St. Albans more than 6o Roman and medieval sites were found . At last , in mid-July , showers cooled off western Europe . " Oh , happy downpour ! " exulted the normally serious French newsmagazine L ' Express after rains came on Bastille Day . Although the heat diminished , the drought continued over large areas . It so dried up clay in the London area that homes by the dozen sank and tilted at crazy angles . The slightest spark also touched off massive forest fires . Flames destroyed more than 4900 acres of vegetation in lower Saxony . And when fire broke out not far from Ascot near Spain 's Ebro River , buried shells and grenades that had failed to explode in 1938 during the civil war suddenly went off , momentarily recreating the Battle of the Ebro . The plight of animals stirred pity . Penguins at the Hanover Zoo in Germany were put into air-conditioned cages , while at the Duisburg Zoo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Fish were dying by the ton as oxygen levels declined . in rivers all over Europe . On Englemere Pond , near Ascot , British authorities stunned 2500 fish with electrical impulses passed through the water , then transferred them to a deeper pond . On Germany 's River Leine , firemen pumped oxygen into the water with air compressors . Everywhere , people were urged ? or ordered ? not to wash cars , water gardens or fill swimming pools . But for sheer drama , the water shortage in southern Britain was unmatchable . Water-wasting penalties were increased from 5 pounds to 400 pounds by an emergency Drought Act rushed through Parliament . Cities stopped watering their parks and sports fields , and London 's perennially green Hyde Park became acres of dust and stubble . British Rail apologized for squalid trains it dared not wash . When Londoners complained about healthy roses in the Soviet embassy garden , it was diplomatically explained that the Russians had not been officially informed of the watering ban . The hardest-hit area of Britain was southeast Wales . Many reser-  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and some were nearly bone-dry . When I visited there early last September , I saw people wearing T-shirts sold by the Welsh National Water Development Authority and bearing a cartoon of naked men and women under a single shower with the inscription , " Get together to save water . " At my hotel in Abergavenny , guests were handed notes urging them to bathe in only two or three inches of water and use only a glassful to brush their teeth . Torrential rains finally came in September , but authorities in every affected country pledged to prevent future droughts from becoming catastrophic by digging more and deeper wells , raising dams to expand reservoir capacity and enlarging pipeline grid systems that allow weaker rivers to feed off healthier ones . As Europe began shoring up its badly weakened economy , British " Drought Minister " Denis Howell said : " We have been lucky in having abnormally high autumn and winter rain and snow to help return water tables to almost their usual levels . But even so , millions of Europeans are going to be more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most precious elements . The emphasis must be on careful planning to ensure that we avoid the serious trouble experienced in 1976. " @#
