As he headed for lunch in Nairobi last week , Secretary of State Henry Kissinger was besieged by reporters with questions about President Ford 's latest primary defeats . " Why blame me ? " Kissinger replied . " I was out of the country . " Nevertheless , he added , he was checking every morning to make sure that his plane was still parked at the Nairobi airport . <P> Behind the lighthearted banter was a grimly sober realization : every time Ford loses a primary , Kissinger is bound to get some-or much-of the blame . When the President lost the North Carolina primary , for example , his confidant Mel Laird and his campaign chairman Rogers Morton both remarked that Kissinger would not remain in office much longer . After the more critical setbacks in Texas and Indiana , Kissinger was under even greater fire from a number of top Republicans and White House aides . <P> Ford 's staff was especially outraged that Kissinger gave his speech calling for black majority rule in southern Africa only four days before the Texas primary . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complained one aide . Said another : " The timing of the Kissinger trip was bad enough . So why did Henry have to be quite so outspoken and provocative in reading the riot act to the Rhodesians ? Does n't he realize that there are people in this country who might , see the situation differently , who might think we 're abandoning an old friend under pressure from a lot of screaming , <P> Johnny-come-lately Communist or radical-leaning black nations ? " But , the aide was asked , was n't Kissinger 's line justified , to a great extent , from a policy standpoint ? " You mean from a foreign policy standpoint , " he retorted in what amounted to a stunning show of political cynicism . <P> There was , in fact , little evidence that Kissinger 's speech had cost the President many votes in Texas , or anywhere else for that matter . The local press did not give the address much play ; minds were doubtless made up on other issues . What is more , Kissinger 's African speech had been cleared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ford himself . The President and Kissinger had gone over its outline in two one-hour sessions , and Ford had indicated his decision to support the revised policy at a Cabinet meeting before the Secretary left for Africa . Finally , the timing was dictated not by Kissingerian whim but by a long-scheduled United Nations trade meeting in Kenya ( see THE WORLD ) ; Kissinger did not just wander aimlessly into the Dark Continent . <P> Yet , there was no doubt that Ronald Reagan believed attacking Secretary Kissinger was good politics . Again and again the Californian lashed out at the Administration for adopting the policies that have inflamed the Republican right wing : Kissinger 's having " bowed and scraped " before the Soviet Union in his efforts to maintain detente ; his negotiations to " give away " the Panama Canal ; his overtures to Fidel Castro last year ; his purported pessimism about the future of America and the free world .
