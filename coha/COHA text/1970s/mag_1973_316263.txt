China continues its quest for new contacts and alignments throughout the world . Last week , the Chinese welcomed the inaugural flight to Peking by Ethiopian Airlines . TIME 's Hong Kong Bureau Chief Roy Rowan was aboard and duly found himself face to face with Premier Chou En-lai at the Great Hall of the People . His report : <P> After climbing what seemed like an acre of white marble stairs , up a cascading red carpet , we were herded into position on a three-tiered platform erected especially for group portraits with the Premier . Immediately in strode Chou , brisk and businesslike , and very trim in a plain gray tunic with matching gray trousers . A miniature Chairman Mao button pinned to his tunic gave the only dash of color to his outfit . The guests applauded the Premier , and Chou , still unsmiling , clapped in return . Floodlights snapped on and the official photographer cranked off three exposures . Then everybody trailed after the Premier as he entered the Great Hall of the People for the banquet . <P> For the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interpreter , he alternately fielded and ducked the questions thrown at him , but usually with a quip . <P> " Are you coming to the United States ? " one guest asked . <P> " I do n't know which airline to take , " said Chou . " I have too many debts for foreign travel . " <P> Each time Chou moved to a new table , he shook everyone 's hand . Then a waiter would give him a warm , moist rag to wipe his hands . His right hand was injured during the Long March and is sensitive . <P> " How high-ranking a diplomat will the U.S. send to Peking ? " someone asked . <P> " Not less than the ambassadorial level that the U.S. has in some countries , " he replied . <P> " Is Henry Kissinger a good negotiator ? " <P> " I think so ! " <P> " When will China inaugurate air service abroad ? " <P> " Within a year . Asia will have the first priority . Africa too . Canada will be first in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thomas M. Keesling , asked when China might be opened up to tourists . " Have you met our travel service people ? " asked Chou . Moments later , Yang Kung-su , director of the China International Travel Service , was delivered to the table . Chou then told both Keesling and Director Yang that he would like to see a greater exchange of people and that Keesling could come back to China to work on this whenever he wanted . Then the questions started again . <P> " When do you think the U.S. and the Peoples ' Republic of China will establish full diplomatic relations ? " <P> " You have Chiang Kai-shek 's representatives in the U.S. , " said Chou . " Once you realize that Taiwan is a province of China , that will solve everything . " <P> The Premier continued to table-hop . At every table Chou would carefully clink his glass of Mao Tai , which he barely sipped , against the glass of each guest . One very striking young Ethiopian woman started to pull back her glass , reminding the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Chou 's eyes stayed right on the beautiful lady and his glass kept moving forward until it clinked hers .
