txt The election came , the election went , but nothing changed in Bill . Then not much ever does . ? There had been a mayor 's race brewing in this tiny Western town . An upset was in the offing and Bill observers agreed that the race could come down to a single vote . There were even those at the general store who were saying there might be a trend here  --  As Bill goes , so goes the nation ? But where in tarnation is Bill ? IF YOUR BRAKES are bad , you might miss it . Tho it 's on the map ? a small dot in light blue  --  most people do . The hamlet squats amid the brown barren stretches of Eastern Wyoming on a lonely 114-mile macadam ribbon called Highway 59 . There is one commercial building , one house , and one trailer . The post office , the general store , the local ? *kering hole , the gas station , pool room , and gossip center are housed in one room . It is an abrupt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open spaces . This one-room town is the forum for the mayor , 56-year-old Dean Munkres , who stands chuckling , in cowboy hat and pointed boots , chewing tobacco , behind the cash register . " I think I got a race on my hands , " Munkres said a few days before the election . " MY SON DAVID Is opposing me for mayor . And his wife , Cindy , has n't talked to me in two months . I got one-third of the town mad at me and the other third running against me , I 'm not sure I 'll win . " The question was never resolved . No votes were cast , no winner proclaimed and Bill never set a trend . The mayoral election was simply postponed and the rumblings of an upset on the Bill scene stayed all in the family . Munkres , the pillar of society , continued as mayor . And Bill , Wyo. , pop . 3 , stayed the same . In the past , elections were easier for Munkres  --  back in the days of zero @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to town , when Bill had only one citizen  --  himself . MUNKRES BOUGHT Bill for $12,000 in 1956 . It was not a new town then . It had been founded as a rural post office by three ranchers , all named Bill , in the 1920s . Here Munkres moved to get away from the ' crowded town of Douglas , pop . 12,000 , and set his family up , rural style , and himself in business . But after four years , his wife took the kids and left him , reducing Bill 's population to one . It was then that Munkres seized the reins of power . He got himself a red fire hat and on it painted his duties  --  postmastet ' , fire chief had one fire in the history of the town , police chief , dog catcher , " That 's for the time I spend chasing Charlie  --  the damndest dog you ever saw  --  out from her naps under the trucks " and mortician ? " never had a death yet , if there had been , there would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became the sole chamber of Bill 's commerce . Here dusty ranchers and oil riggers pull up , thirsty for a cold beer and hungry for some small talk , a letter from home , or maybe a hot sausage sandwich . In this rural outpost , heated by , a big coal-burning stove and stocked with cases of beer , Munkres offers just about everything from work gloves and stereo tapes to the specialty of the house  --  pickled pigs feet  --  kept stashed away in a gallon jar on the counter . " When I moved out here , this place was pretty primitive . The old guy who was here before kept it that way . -I HAD MY OWN power plant then  --  a windmill that pumped water and generated electricity . The power lines are in now but we still have no phone  --  I use that radio there to talk to the outside . " We got our personal zip code here 82631 ? not too many people have that . We had a department of sanitation until a strong wind blew the outhouse down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use it , I just tell ' em , ' Well , if you can wait , I 'm building one . ' " Never had to do much as police chief . Sometimes some of the old buzzards come here and get tanked up . I just grab my gun under the cash register here and fire a few into the floor . That gets their attention and they start behavin ' a little better . " WE 'VE HAD A few bullets thru the windows and into the walls but nothing serious . The only way to raise hell in town is in this room and I try to hold it down . Then , I got to mind the parking meter . " Bill 's one parking meter is portable and Munkres moves it at whim out in front of cars parked at the pumps . ' He takes it in at night or during bad weather . The proceeds , the town 's treasury , are kept in an old pop can . " When I get enough , " says Munkres , " I 'm going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He 's also posted a sign on the front of the store that reads : . " Drive Slow ! The life you save might be Dean Munkres. " it worked , he said , he 's never written a ticket or been hit . As for the future , Munkres says he believes in progress but not expansion . " I moved out here for the quiet . . . I like this sort of life . You can still hear the coyotes bowl and the antelope graze all around . My son and his wife moved out here two years ago and they put their trailer 20 feet from the store . Then they said , ' Well , now we 're part of the town . ' " ' The hell , ' I said . ' The town 's big enough ' But I let them in . They share my ideas about the place . " AT 7 P.M. I CLOSE up shop . Then out there I do what any old bachelor does at night . I cook myself some dinner , watch some TV @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to town to get drunk  --  if I 'm not drunk before I leave . " If somebody knocks on my door after I close I take a look at them . If they look like they are in trouble and need gas , I go out . If they look like they want trouble  --  and beer  --  I tell ' em to go to hell . I never get lonely here . Plenty of people come here . Why , sometimes they go thru 30 cases of beer before I close . I see enough people , that 's for sure . " THE OUTER WORLD , however , Is knocking on Bill 's door . A new strip of railroad track , the longest to be laid in 30 years , is going down 100 yards behind Bill 's general store . " I got civilization breathing down my back , " said Munkres . " All those coal cars rattling by behind us . There 's nothing I can do about it except to make sure they never stop here . " " I do n't want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I never want to sell out either ... what would I do with the money out here if I had it . I 'm never going to leave , just get older . My son and his wife are starting to take the place over . . ? I 've given them some of the titles , like city clerk to my daughter in law and police chief to my son . They do n't want it to get any bigger either . " YOU HAVE TO TRAVEL some to find Bill . And most who stop are on their way somewhere else . The regulars of Highway 59 have gotten to know it  --  the ranchers , truckers , hunters , and oil riggers who make the 114-mile Douglas to Gillette , Wyo. , run . It 's that little stop along the way  --  the only one in fact  --  that offers a respite from the road , a cold beer , hot coffee , or some chairs to stretch your legs . Munkres likes it that way . He welcomes the business but he is glad to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pulling out in his pick-up truck onto an empty highway and the windswept dipping terrain beyond . He points to a stack of bumper stickers that proclaim , " I 've been to Bill . " " Maybe I 'll make a new one , " he said , walking back to the cash register . " It 'll read : ' Where the hell is Bill ? " '
