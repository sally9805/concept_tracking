Equus ( Plymouth ) The Britain-on-Broadway season continues . Equus is by Peter Shaffer , who belongs to an English playwrights club that includes Torn Stoppard and Peter Nichols , the Latter-day League of Middle Seriousness . Shaffer is best known here for Five Finger Exercise and The Royal Hunt of the Sun , two plays that aimed heavy thematic artillery but then , like Chaplin 's cannon , fired their shells only a little plopping way . Equus does better , but not enough . It was first produced last year by the National Theater in London , and the American production , which is generally admirable , is based on the earlier one ? the same director , one of the original two leading actors , the same costume and scene design . The setting is a low rectangular platform with low rails that have benches inside them . It 's used principally as a psychiatrist 's office but is obviously meant to suggest a boxing ring . Behind the platform are two small arcs of bleachers . Members of the audience occupy most of those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest of the audience in their conventional places out front ; but all of the actors also sit in those seats , or near them , when they are not actually " on . " The lights are mostly boxing-arena white . So the play , which deals with a doctor and a young patient , is presented as a match between them . This is clever enough but fundamentally irrelevant ? or at least no more relevant than in any analyst-patient relationship . The virtues of the production lie elsewhere . Shaffer notes in the program and in the newly published book ( Equus and Shrivings , Atheneum ; $7.95 ) how he got the idea for the play . A friend told him about a shocking crime . Shaffer then " modified " it for his purposes . As he presents it , a 17-year-old boy , employed on weekends at a stable in southern England , one night blinds six horses . The magistrate before whom the boy is brought asks a psychiatrist to take theboy on . Though the play is interwoven with enacted memories and enacted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : how the doctor breaks through the boy 's defenses , with the aid ? somewhat unwitting ? of the boy 's parents , and finally uncovers the reason for his barbarous act . Since this is not a Hitchcock psycho drama , there 's no reason not to reveal what is discovered . The boy 's religious mother had put a picture of a flagellated Christ in his bedroom ; the boy 's atheist father had taken down the Christ and put up a photograph of a horse , head-on , eyes large . The boy had developed a combined religious-sexual fixation about horses ( it does sound a bit like a pat Hitchcock psycho script ) and used secretly to go galloping naked at night on a particular horse , having orgasms as he went . One night the girl who had got him his job in the stable took him back there . They attempted to make love , but he was impotent because he felt that the horses were watching . He frightened the girl off ; then , frenetic and ashamed ? more ashamed because he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl ? he blinded the animals who figuratively watched the act . His ability to reveal the story at last is said by the doctor to cure him , more or less , of his troubles . ( Shaffer says he has had expert advice , but this conclusion seems , medically , rather neat . ) Now the author sensed , quite rightly , that this chronicle was not enough . In fact , during the first half of the play , not much more than this psychical detective story is begun , and at intermission the play seems somewhat gauzy . During the second half , texture gets laid on . Shaffer has characterized the doctor as unhappily and frigidly married , and during the second half we learn that the doctor , who is an amateur of ancient Greece and its myths and rituals , is fundamentally jealous of his patient 's passion . Crippling and painful though the boy 's fixation is , it 's at least hot and consuming , says the doctor whose job it now is to excise the boy 's passion and render @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more ferocious than I have felt in any second of my life , " he tells the magistrate . He describes his life , with its three-week planned tours of Greece every year , the rest of the time spent with a woman he has n't even kissed in six years . Bitterly he concludes : " Then in the morning I put away my books on the cultural shelf , close up the kodachrome snaps of Mount Olympus , touch my reproduction statue of Dionysus for luck ? and go off to hospital to treat him for insanity . " The speech is flashily effective ( like the boxing-ring gimmick ) , but my own reaction was : " And quite right , too . You should treat him . He 's sick and you 're a doctor , and you 're well and you know it . " The moment summed up for me a conviction that the doctor 's jealousy was only Shaffer 's fabrication ? R. D. Laing diluted and ladled in to fill the dramatic vessel to the top . The original murder story had apparently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its singularity , and he had tried to mine some mythic significance out of it . ( Horses loom large in myth . ) Then , realizing at halftime that the play was thin and the mythic addenda insufficient , he had worked in this doctor's-jealousy theme . I 'm not trying to criticize telepathically or by the standard of intention but by what is given us . The doctor to whom the passionate boy is brought just happens to be passion-starved ( he says ) and just happens to be a devotee of the myths that the patient 's case adumbrates . Neatness , neatness all the way ? as when one builds from the end forward . And we are asked to believe that the one doctor to whom the magistrate will entrust the boy , the only one who has the magistrate 's confidence , has faulty that it is now flourishing financially and intellectually , which puts it in a special category for both university and trade publishers . It has accomplished this feat by facing its " substantial deficit " four years ago and virtually starting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ University Council voted it " start-over " funds , with the stipulation that future income would apply to the repayment of these funds . Second , under a new director who was moved up to that spot from copy editor , it cut its staff from 26 to six , turned off its water cooler ( thus saving enough money a month to buy stamps ) , made up its committed backlog of 17 books , and then reduced its yearly list to 12 , in that way avoiding overcommitment and at the same time giving each staff member a chance to be personally involved with every book . The press is much concerned with the design of its books ? one , Clarice Short 's book of poetry , won an award for being one of the 50 best-designed books in the US last year ? and with promotion and circulation . Being back in the black after so long has given director Norma Mikkelsen a feeling of security . Sign : she has ordered the water cooler turned back on . Troubles at Macmillan continue . Aaron Asher , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , has resigned ; other senior editors have left , including the editor of the children 's book department , and its managing editor . I repeat all this " news " only because yesterday I came upon the July 22 , 1974 Publishers Weekly in which there appears a five-page interview with Macmillan 's chairman , Raymond C. Hagel . What was he saying three months before the October 14 mass dismissal of 200 personnel and the subsequent departure of many others ? Asked about the role of editors at Macmillan : Hagel : The greatest problem in any large company is that sheer size tends to reduce our sense of individuality . That 's precious . We have to protect it . Asked : Over the years there has grown in the trade a feeling that Macmillan is a revolving door for editors and executives . How did this negative image of Macmillan come about , and what is being done to correct it ? Nagel : By and large , we never have had the mass exoduses that have been associated with other publishing houses . We 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have left the company by request . Occasionally we have fired someone for cause . On the other hand , we 've had people leave for the best reasons in the world ... It seems to me that it is also a compliment to Macmillan to have people who have been trained here valued so highly . I have never known anyone who has been ashamed to mention that he has worked for Macmillan , it usually is the first thing that goes on an application for a new job . As long as that happens I 'm not really worried . I am proud that today , on the whole , we have more and better editors in our trade , school and college publishing divisions than ever before . Our confidence in them is mirrored in the record investments we have been making and will continue to make in our lists . No comment . Reviewed in these pages ( TNR , Oct. 19 , 1974 ) were three novels from the Fiction Collective . From the pages of Coda , the poets and writers newsletter , I learn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , Museum by B. H. Friedman , and Twiddledunr Twaddledum by Peter Spielberg , all sold out before their publishing date in October . The three writers " worked ten hours a day , seven days a week " for a year to do their own publishing . Their printing investment may be repaid by sales , if returns from bookstores are not too heavy but " will never pay the value of their time . " The collective exists as " a not-for-profit cooperative conduit " for quality fiction . More operating details : each title costs $3500 to publish . This money is loaned to the collective by the writer and is paid back to him from sales receipts after discounts and distribution costs are deducted . Distribution is by George Braziller , the nine members of the group operate from an office given to them by Brooklyn College , and they hope to have a list of 10-12 books a year which they will sell for $7.95 hardcover and $3.95 in paper . The print order is 500 copies , but the potential profit is reduced by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ price . The cooperative has sold 30 books thus far at full price , many more to bookstores at 40 percent discount , library jobbers at 50 percent . The collective can with luck just about break even on a title , so it is a brave venture worthy of support and encouragement . The New York State Council on the Arts has just given it a grant for administrative expenses . Word reached me indirectly that Southern Voices , in its first year and fourth copy , is in serious financial straits . This is a magazine ( six times a year ; $7 ) of growing quality that celebrates , as its editor said in the last issue " the potential of people . " Published in Atlanta , Georgia it celebrates as well the real South , its natural beauty , its troubles and triumphs , even its baking . ( The recent issue has a mouth-watering piece called " A Treatise Upon Corn Bread . " ) Editor Pat Watters tells me that they will suspend publication for at least one issue , until April/May ' 75 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magazine , and to recast its advertising . From its present 23,000 subscribers Southern Voices is pressing to get renewals , gift subscriptions and donations , with an eye to eventually having about 100,000 subscribers . Meanwhile I send them my fraternal hopes that they , like Faulkner 's Dilsy , will endure . They deserve to . for some materials ? Apollo-Dionysus , lurking Pan , lurking Laing ? to give it body and to " serious " it up . The result is certainly not dreadful or boring . I 've noted only a few of the many effective moments ; and Shaffer 's writing as such , though he ca n't be said to have developed a distinguishable style , never falls below that minimal adroitness with which most British writers apparently are born . But the atmosphere of manufacture , of utilization , makes Shaffer seem a creator of modish dramatic interiors , smartly furnished with whatever ideas happen to be going at the moment . A few things in the production are unfortunate . The device of having all the actors always remain on stage at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a dreadful strain on the waiting actors ' attention ) . Roberta Maxwell , whom I 've liked greatly in Slag and Miss Julie , is miscast as the stable girl . She 's too old and too complex for the part . But John Dexter , the director , has made the play swirl and flare . He has used his six " horses " ? young men in leotards with wire stilts and wire equine masks ? with a centaur 's eye . He has got a stunning , elemental performance of the boy from Peter Firth , who also played it in London . And he has helped that good actor Anthony Hopkins ( now visible in The Girl from Petrovka and Juggernaut ) to model his immense role with depth and idiosyncrasy . I wish that Hopkins would n't say " chooldren " for " children , " but I 'm grateful for practically everything else that he does . How well he times pauses with his thoughts , how well he balances dedication and humor and embarrassment about his own emotions . Michael Higgins is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sternhagen has one of the best moments : a speech in which the boy 's pious schoolteacher-mother rejects the doctrine of absolute parental responsibility for a child 's psyche , puts some of the burden on the boy himself , and declares her belief in the devil .
