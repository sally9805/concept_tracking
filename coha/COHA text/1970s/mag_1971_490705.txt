THE TALI ( OF THE TOWN Notes and Comment RECENTLY , we read in the Post that Barnard College was offering a program for credit that required the students to live in a commune . At Barnard , that is , Life itself , in a sense , is being offered as a course . One of the students in the program told the Post reporter , " We 're based on a premise that life and learning arc not separate things . Education is fun this way . We like to learn . " And Dr. Paul Lippmann , an instructor in the new program , said of these students , " Their learning is in their living . It 's not an isolated , alienated thing you do with the blackboard . " As we read the Post article , a host of questions about life and education came crowding into our mind , and we 've set a few of them down . Should there be prerequisites for such a program as this ? History courses ? Sociology courses ? Psychology courses ? Could there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ improvement in his ability to cope with life situations . In the first semester , his life was only ' poor , ' but this semester it has been ' fair .

In personal-confrontation situations , her attention wanders . We have caught her hiding history honks under her table , and she often stares blankly out of the window during consciousness-raising .

Would they get credit for their papers ? Do we want all this ? Fluoridation IT has been seven years since the psy- chotic general in " Dr. Strangelove " claimed that our " precious bodily fluids ' ' were being sapped and impurified by " the in te rn a di ilia Communist conspiracy , " with fluoridation , and five years since fluorides were put in New York City 's water supply . It occurred to us the other clay that we had n't been hearing much about fluoridation , and we got to wondering about it . We wondered whether our teeth were any better . And whether the dissidents had stopped fussing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Health to put our questions to 1 ) r . John 1 ) c Zuane , director of the Bureau of Sanitary Engineering . 1 ) r . De Zuane , a nice-looking man of forty-right with brown eyes , a sloping forehead , and an Italian accent ( he emigrated to this country from Trieste in 1956 ) , told IS that it was too early to say . whether fluoridation had helped cut down the cavity rate in New York City . In 1964 , the Department 's Bureau of Dentistry did a before-fluoridation control study on New York City 's rate of tooth decay ; the after-fluoridation study is to he initiated any month now . Preliminary reports from the field , however , indicate that fluoridation has been as beneficial here as scientific studies completed in other parts of the state , and the world , over the last twenty-five years have proved it to he there . As for the cranks , Dr. Dc inane said that to his  --  and the Department of Health 's  --  pleasant surprise , they all but vanished once fluoridation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It had taken so many years to put fluoridation into effect , and fluoridation had become such an emotional issue , that we anticipated many complaints , " Dr. De Zuane told us . " We set up special phones to answer the hundreds of calls we expected to receive , but the phones did n't ring . About a year and a half after fluoridation was launched , we heard from a respectable outfit called the Joint Organizations Opposing Fluoridation , whose president , Paduano , was a Commissioner of Water Supply , Gas , and Electricity hack in the early fifties . Mr. Paduano 's group came up with a list of objections . ? Ve think we 've been able to answer them satisfactorily , and a few other technical doubts about fluoridation as well . " One objection involved money . Of the one hundred and sixty gallons of water assigned to each person in New York City per day , only two gallons were used for drinking and the preparation of food , Mr. Paduano 's group pointed out ; the rest was used for showering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group believed that it was a waste of money to fluoridate one hundred and sixty gallons for the sake of two gallons . The Department of Health figured nut that the cost of initiating fluoridation in New York City came to ten cents per person and the subsequent annual cost to eight cents per person  --  sums it considered trivial compared to the pre-fluoridation cost of dental care to the public and to the city . Mr. Paduano 's group feared that fluoridation might accelerate the corrosion of the cit ) ' s six thousand miles of water pipes . Corrosion has been a prohkm for a century , but there is no evidence that fluoridation has accelerated it . Another concern was that if the fluoridation equipment somehow went on the blink , or if the fluoride compound stuck to the uneven walls of the city 's water pipes for a year or so and was then suddenly released , New Yorkers would get an overdose of fluorides . One part of fluoride per one million parts of water is the optimum ratio of fluorides for New York City ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the past five years , the Department of Health and the Department of Water Resources have gone around the city and collected over a hundred thousand samples of water ; none of these samples have contained more than one and a half parts of fluoride . Ironically , what did happen , just a year ago , was that New York , along with such other cities as Philadelphia and Chicago , experienced a fluoride shortage . " New York City needs approximately ten thousand tons of hydrofluosilicic acid annually to fluoridate its water , " Dr. De Zuane explained . " Hydrofluosilicic acid is a by-product of the manufacture of fertilizer . In 1969 , the production of fertilizer decreased in the United States , mainly because India , which had been a major importer , opened fertilizer plants of its own , so we had a national shortage of fluorides . We had to shut down the fluoridation feeding stations an average of three days a month . We did n't publicize the shortage . Publicizing it would n't have accomplished anything . We were considering going to foreign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ companies committed themselves to the manufacture of hydrofluosilicic acid as a separate product , su the problem has been solved . " There are still about seven hundred thousand residents of Queens who are not drinking fluoridated water . Their water is supplied by two private water companies that have not yet complied with New York City 's fluoridation law . The larger of the two companies , the Jamaica Water Supply Company , claims that it has been unable to come up with a means of treating the water it supplies to five hundred and twenty-five thousand Queens residents without also fluoridating the water it supplies to one hundred and twenty-five thousand people in Nassau County , where it has no authority to fluoridate the water . Since the Jamaica Water Supply Company has nothing to gain by fluoridating , it is content with the status quo . In 1967 , Connecticut became the first state in the United States to require every water company with twenty thousand or more customers to fluoridate ; New York City 's Department of Health hopes that Nassau County will adopt compulsory fluoridation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to try to find a legal way to compel the private companies to provide the Queens residents with the kind of protection that the Department thinks their teeth ought to have . The smaller company , the New York Water Service Division of the Utilities &; Industries Corporation , says it will do anything the Jamaica Water Supply Company does . In 1969 , Norman Mailer ran for Mayor of New York on an end-fluoridation platform . We asked Dr. De Zuane what he thought of that . He said he thought fluoridation was a question of health , not a question of politics . He cited a remark made in 1969 by Lady Birk , the chairman of Great Britain 's Health Education Council . " I see the anti-fluoride campaigners as the flat-earthers of the space age , " Lady Birk said . " I 'm all in favor of having eccentrics around , but when it affects the health of children , it 's time to combat it . " YUP AN alert young computer operator of our acquaintance reports that she was standing in front of one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watching the printouts , when the following message unfolded before her eyes : A MINUS SIGN FOLLOWING AN AMOUNT IN THE UNREALIZED REVENUE COLUMN INDICATES OVERREALIZED REVENUE Mock Trial SEVERSEVERAL of New York 's coma --  AL m organizations got together the other Sunday to stage what they called a Housing Crimes Trial , by means of which frustrated tenants could try to hale the persons they considered responsible for their troubles into court . The trial  --  it was mock , though it had many of the trappings of a real judicial process  --  was held in the VIA-man Auditorium of Columbia University . The idea was conceived by the Metropolitan Council on Housing a federation of tenants and tenant organizations  --  and had the endorsement of various other groups , including the City-Wide Coardinating Committee of Welfare Rights Groups , the East Side Tenants Council , the United Welfare League , the Yorkville S a v e-O u r-H om e s Committee , the United Puerto Rican Students of Columbia University , the Movement for Puerto Rican Independence , the Young Lords , the Black Panther Party , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the auditorium a little before one in the afternoon , when the trial was supposed to start , and found that about two hundred people had already taken seats . The room was brightly lighted , and spotlights illuminated four baize-covered tables that had been placed on or near the stage  --  one for the court 's judges , one for a group of ten prosecutors , one for the chief prosecutor , and one for witnesses . ( All the prosecutors and judges represented participating organizations , but any spectator could register as a witness . ) Behind the judges ' table , which was on the stage , hung a large sign that read , in red and Mack letters , " Housing Crimes Trial  --  People 's Court . " We took a chair at a press table at one side of the auditorium , but we soon discovered that this mock trial , like a lot of real ones , was going to begin late . Looking around the room , we saw that the spectators spanned several age groups and ethnic groups . Many wore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ berets of the Panthers . Young people , most of whom were fairly well dressed , outnumbered older people , many of whom wore coats , shawls , vests , or sweaters that looked neat but shabby . At about two-fifteen , the proceedings finally began , and after some preliminary speeches Jane Benedict , the chairman of the Metropolitan Council on Housing , stood up to explain why her organization had decided to sponsor the event . She is a short , gray-haired woman , and she said , among other things , " We felt  --  all of us , all of us who are participating in this trial -- that there is a necessity for the people to speak out , and in a people 's court . And we do not consider this a joke . It may he a mock trial , but it is not a mockery  --  it is not a comedy . " Next , the judges  --  there were six , one for each of the chief sponsoring organizations -- took turns reading a lengthy indictment , whose counts included offenses like permitting slum conditions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harassment . Then the chief judge  --  Durie " I suppose it 's perverse of me , bast I ca n't wait to see them all pile off the train and flounder around looking for their cars . " ? ? Bethea , a young girl in a light-blue sweatshirt and jeans , who was the judge from the Black Panther Party  --  stood up and said , " Will the following defendants rise and come forward ? " She named Mayor Lindsay ; Albert A. Walsh , the city 's Housing and Development Administrator ; Benjamin Altman , the city 's Rent and Housing Maintenance Commissioner ; Simeon Golar , the New York City Housing Authority chairman ; and various other officials of the city government , of banks , and of Columbus Hospital  --  one of several hospitals that were accused of buying up property in their areas and evicting tenants . She paused , and spectators began looking around the room . The organizers of the trial had served " summonses " on all the people named , and though the sponsors did not really expect any of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might send representatives . But no one came forward , and Mrs. Bethea said firmly , " The defendants have failed to appear and are hereby declared in contempt of the Court of the People . " The next several hours turned into a kind of landlord 's nightmare , with prosecutors calling on witnesses to describe the conditions in which they lived and the hurdles they had tried to overcome in seeking redress of their grievances . One black woman spoke of staying awake the greater part of every night to keep rats out of the bed in which her two sons slept . Another said that her young daughter had suffered brain damage from eating flaking paint . Still another testified that her landlord had threatened her verbally , had threatened another female tenant with a gun , and had brought in two men to beat up a young male tenant . A young white woman said that her landlord had torn out electric wiring and had arranged to have her building vandalized , in order to frighten away its tenants . As the trial went on , stories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of hot water , and illnesses caused by heatless winters began to sound almost routine . A number of witnesses were squatters who had moved into vacant apartments ( there are estimated to he fifty thousand vacant apartments in New York City ) after living conditions in their own had become intolerable . Revolutionary rhetoric pervaded the remarks of most of the judges and prosecutors , but most of the witnesses spoke simply and directly . The event was scheduled to continue into the night , but we left at about five-thirty . The next afternoon , we dropped by the office of the Metropolitan Council on Housing , on West Thirty-first Street , and talked with Jane Benedict . She told us that the trial had lasted until about nine-forty-five , that about fifteen hundred people had attended , and that , to no one 's surprise , the defendants had all been found guilty in absentia . " Sentencing was left up to each judge , " she said " In my own sentencing speech , I recommended that the ownership of all housing in New York City be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buildings but of the entire housing picture . " We asked Mrs. Benedict why the sponsors had decided to stage a mock trial instead of taking the cases to the city 's courts . She looked at us steadily and smiled . " Have you ever frier ( to bring a housing case to court ? " she asked . " Do you know about the interminable delays and adjournments , not to mention the difficulties a trial presents to poor people in the first placei ' The housing situation in New York is a morass , and we hoped that this trial of ours might help bring the plight of desperate people to the attention of the city government . We 've worked so long with people that ? Well , the whole thing really reminds me of Dickens ' Bleak House . ' Do you remember ? The court proceedings were delayed for so long that the pertinent papers finally went up in smoke  --  they had caught fire through spontaneous combustion . We ca n't afford to wait that long . " ? AFOOTLOOSE friend reports that last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chewing gum with the brand name Brooklyn . Jimmy L. Webb IN 1965 , when he was nineteen , a musician named Jim Webb wrote the exhilarating song called " Up , Up and Away , " which , in a recorded version by the Fifth Dimension , went on to win a Grammy Award for 1967 . Since then , Webb has become known as the author of a number nf other popular songs , including " By the Time I Get to Phoenix " Glen Campbell 's recording of which also won a Grammy Award for 1967 ) , " Wichita Lineman , " " The Worst That Could Happen , " and " MacArthur Park . " In 1970 , Webb  --  who until then had remained pretty much behind the scenes , as a composer , lyricist , pianist , arranger , record producer , and music publisher  --  decided to start performing his own songs . He recorded an album that was released in November , and in December he set out on a road tour that , a couple of weeks ago , brought him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Along with the start of his singing career came a decision to use a longer form of his name  --  Jimmy L. Webb  --  in public . ) We attended Mr. Webb 's opening , at which he played the piano and sang , accompanied by three other musicians , before an audience made up largely of members of the press . The next afternoon , we dropped around to see him at the Drake Hotel , where he was staying . He is now twenty-four , and he is of medium height , with a broad , friendly face and long brown hair . He was wearing a blue windbreaker , a green shirt , jeans , ankle-high gray suede shoes , and silver-rimmed glasses , and he had what appeared to be a day 's growth of heard . After offering us a chair , he sat down on a sofa and asked us what we would like to know . " You might start by telling us the story of your life , " we said . " The story of my life , " Webb said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that would n't be as hard as it sounds at first , because my young life was very simple . I grew up in small towns . My father was a Baptist minister . We travelled from small town to small town , mainly in Oklahoma and Texas . I would say the longest we spent in a town was four years . We were in a lot of places , but it was always the same we went to church on Sunday and prayer meeting on Wednesday night , and on Christmas Eve we went to church , and on New Year 's we went to church , and we went to church for revivals , and we went to church for weddings and funerals . In Wellington , Texas , when I was six y ears old , my mother sent me to my first piano lesson . I rode my bike and I took my dog , and thereafter she forced me to a music lesson from time to time . In Oklahoma City , had the opportunity of working with a real fine musician , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and she first taught me to improvise hymns for offertories . I started writing my first songs  --  my first , like , primitive efforts  --  when I was about fourteen . And it was a shock to my family when I started playing piano in rock-and-roll hands , and things like that . They thought that I should really use my talent more in the church . But in 1964 my dad took a pastorate at the First Southern Baptist Church in Colton , California . A big change came into my life at that point , because I was suddenly deluged with information  --  information about life in general . I just mean that there was a lot more going on in the world than I was aware of when I left Laverne , Oklahoma , at the age of eighteen . " Webb told us that he had enrolled in San Bernardino Valley College , as a music major , but had dropped out after his freshman year and moved to Los Angeles , where he soon began working for music publishers and record companies .

In 1967 , while Ile was under contract as a songwriter to Johnny Rivers Music , he was asked to help plan an album for a group that had recently changed its name from the Versatiles to the Fifth Dimension . One of the songs he arranged for the group was his " Up , Up and Away , " which had been shown to a number of record companies and singers over the previous year or so without eliciting much interest . We asked him how hr had come to write " Up , Up and Away . " He smiled , and said , " I sat down at the piano one day , and I went dorm to-dinar da-to-daaa . That 's the truth . I mean , I ca n't explain it any simpler than that . I wrote that song as a lark . It was just ? I enjoyed writing it as much as it sounds I did . You know what I mean ? It was just fun . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thirty-five minutes . ' By the Time I Get to Phoenix ' is a song I wrote about two years before it became popular . It 's just a very real song about a situation that was going on in my life in high school . I was in love with a girl , and I was having some ? Well , the typical adolescent problems . It was n't a fast song . It kind of evolved , and I changed it a couple of times . By the Time I Get to Phoenix ' was shown to .. johete  --  that 's Motown 's publishing firm  --  a year or so before Glen Campbell recorded it , but Jobete did n't want it . They said to me , ' Look , we ca n't use that song unless you put a chorus after each verse . ' " He grinned , and we helped ourself to a cup of coffee from a large pot on a table in front of us . We asked Webb how he felt about his nascent career as a singer . He sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just feel that , to make creative music interesting , I have to make it a more personal experience . Less clinical , less removed  --  less commercial , in a word . And I feel that , certainly , the future of the composer lies in cornmunicating his music directly to people . That 's why the songwriter-singer phenomenon has occurred , where almost overnight we suddenly have dozens of people who are performing their own songs rather than somebody else 's . But in my case ? ' Well , after the enormous success of ' Up , Up and Away ' and some of my other songs , I was caught up in a whirl of publicity . And until this last year I was so busy  --  I did so much production , I rushed from one thing to another so fast  --  that I never took time to learn a lot of the things I should have learned . I always had the urge to do this sort of thing , but I did n't know what my capabilities were . So I spent the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practicing the piano and working on my singing . Now I 'm beginning to see that I am capable of singing my songs for people . I know that I 'm not a great technical singer , but all that I 'm trying to offer is my music and my words , in my own way . If I squeak a note every now and then , or something , to me that 's not the most important thing . The communication that 's been taking place has been so inspiring to me that I feel like I feel like if I do n't ever really learn to sing , and I cornmun ; cate as much as I 've been communicating , I 'll be happy .
