 | Last July , some 16 months after her husband had died , Mrs. Casali gave birth to their third child , a son , Milo . This is her story of that baby ? a story of love , hope and modern science . To most of us the words " artificial insemination " have a hard , cold , clinical , almost inhuman sound . Not so to Kim Grove Casali . To her those words are the symbol of all that is hopeful and alive and loving ? specifically the symbol of her boundless love for her late husband , Roberto Casali . For it was artificial insemination that gave Kim her third son , Milo Roberto , conceived from sperm his father had deposited in a London sperm bank and born on July 10 , 1977 , 16 months after cancer had taken its toll and cut off Roberto Casali 's life . Milo is a cheerful , strapping baby ( 10th pounds at birth ) and is already showing the sparkling good looks which run in the Casali family . As for Kim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to think she 'd never know again , the kind she remembers from the first four golden years of her marriage , before Roberto 's malignancy was found and diagnosed . In those days she and her Italian-born husband had the world at their fingertips . They were very much in love ; they had two handsome sons , and a beautiful home and they were fast becoming famous ? she as the creator of a newspaper cartoon called " Love is ... " ; he as her business manager . Kim had stumbled into her career as a result of the love notes she and Roberto exchanged during their years of dating before they married . She 'd always been an incurable doodler , she says , and she had begun doodling in her letters ' to Roberto , closing each with a drawing of a little boy and girl and captioning them with the words , " Love is . . . " followed by whatever popped into her head at the moment ( " Love is . . . having someone to cuddle " for example . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as by the tenderness of her sentiments , showed her work to his friend On the Los Angeles Times and @#  | before she knew what was happening her now famous " Love is ... " comic strip was launched . To this day Kim feels " a lit : guilty " about her success . She 'd never studied art seriously and never considered herself an artist . " My doodling was just for Roberto , " she told Good Housekeeping , " and it never occurred to me that it could be syndicated or that it would catch on in so many places . " ( She appears in newspapers in 60 countries . ) Six months after they were married in 1971 , Kim and Roberto moved to England so that Roberto could work for a British computer company . When the job he 'd wanted fell through , he became her business manager and the Casalis were on their way to fame and fortune . They had four wonderful years together , living in an elegant home outside London and basking in their love for each other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five , and Stephano , six . Kim and Roberto had every intention of have ing more children and to go on living ? just as they were ? happily ever after . But in 1975 tragedy struck . Roberto was taken ill and the diagnosis was cancer ? incurable cancer , Kim was told . He might be gone in months , the doctors said . At best , his life could be prolonged for perhaps a year by surgery and radiotherapy . Roberto elected to have both . He was convinced , up to the very end , that he would walk away from the hospital a healthy man . But Kim knew better As month after painful month stretched on , she never let Roberto know what she 'd learned from his doctors , but kept his hopes alive with her own indomitable optimism . If if was humanly possible , she was determined that she and Roberto should continue to live the way they always had and ? especially ? that they should not give up their dream of having four children . But often her husband @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? especially lovemaking by the calendar ( during her fertile days ) . After months of frustration , the possibility of artificial inseminatation occurred to her . She does n't remember how she first broached the subject to Roberto , but she does remember that after a few days of thinking things over , he agreed . To @#  | him , as to her , pregnancy would be an affirmation of their love for each other . One morning , when Roberto was feeling miserable from the effects of radiotherapy , she woke up to find that he had scribbled the words , " l love you " in lipstick on her mirror He was that kind of man . To make sure that what they were doing remained their secret and theirs alone , Kim decided to bypass their family doctor and to consult someone they did n't know . A specialist in artificial insemination was recommended to her by a familyplanning agency in London and Kim set up an appointment . Roberto went with her the first time she saw the specialist ( a woman ) and helped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but one they 'd thought out thoroughly ; further , that they were people who stuck by whatever they 'd decided to do . After samples of Roberto 's semen were extracted and stored , Kim went to the doctor alone . She was told that appointments would be scheduled for her on a month-tomonth basis , 15 days after the onset of each menstrual period . Although she conscientiously followed instructions , nothing came of her first several efforts . ( Perhaps , she now feels Roberto was suffering such agonies at that time that she herself was emotionally incapable of conception . ) But she managed to keep up Roberto 's spirits until the very end . " He was in extremely good spirits that last night , " she says . " He was cheerful and I was glad . I managed to smile and tell him that he was looking lots better . . . . It 's much better to go out sniffing than crying . " But after Roberto was gone , Kim found she could n't keep up her pretenses any longer . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worse . She began having dreadful nightmares and would often wake up screaming and wet with sweat . Not surprisingly , during those first months she made no appointments with her doctor . But finally her own belief in herself and in the joyous ness of life reasserted itself . She made up her mind that this was no time to give up on having Roberto 's child ? especially now when her life seemed so empty and she so much wanted to have a baby in her arms . " During those first bad months @#  | I guess I 'd just forgotten what joy a baby brings . And I also had forgotten that I 'm not the sort of person who gives up on things . " When Kim talked about her romance with Roberto , she remembered that marrying him was something else she had n't given up on . Apparently , when they first met , he was definitely not the marrying kind and it took four years before she was able to change his mind . ( At the time the couple met she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she 'd left New Zealand when she was 19 . She 'd had more than enough of footloose living . He had not . A Roman by birth , he 'd come to the U.S. in search of excitement and had just driven from New York to California on the same mission . They met in a Los Angeles ski club in 1967 . " He 'd never been on a pair of skis , " Kim remembers , grinning . " The only reason he 'd come to the club was to meet girls . After our first date he made me promise never to go near the club again . And I did n't . In fact , I never looked at another man . I guess I 'm hopelessly romantic . " ) Perhaps it was romanticism , perhaps loneliness that made her resume efforts to get pregnant a few months after Roberto died . At any rate , she called up the specialist as soon as she had her next period and made another appointment . She does n't remember how many times she went ( maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , seven months after her husband 's death , she found that she was pregnant . It was a difficult pregnancy and a cruelly lonely one . Complicating her situation was the fact that she was determined to keep her secret ' for as long as possible . But even though she stayed indoors at home most of the time , when she did go out people began to notice ? and knowing her husband was dead , began to gossip . Toward the end , when she " was really feeling awful , " her mother came from New Zealand to stay with her , and together the two women decided the time for secrecy was over . The best way to silence the ugly talk was to tell the truth . The week before Milo was born Kim called in the London Daily Mail ( a newspaper which carried her " Love is ... " cartoons ) and gave her story to the world . The public 's reaction was sudden ,  | intense and mixed . Some of her " Love is . . . " readers ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gutsy , loving woman ; others accused her of being a publicity hound , of defaming her dead husband 's memory , of stigmatizing her unborn baby for life . But Kim stuck by her guns . " I 'm having this baby out of my own choice , my own need , " she told reporters . " I made my decision after a lot of careful thought and I know what I 'm doing is right .... I 'm sure I can give my baby a happy life . I have enough love to go around . " I really do n't worry about what people think , because I know the truth and my family knows it . I also know what kind of a person I am ? that I 'm the kind of mother my children can be proud of . " How will you explain to your children what you 've done ? she was asked . " When Dario and Stephano are old enough , " she said , " I will tell them . " As for Milo , she said later , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father was dead long before he arrived on the scene . By that time I hope he 'll have been loved enough , feel secure enough , to be able to cope with what I have to tell him . " Milo was late . When he finally put in his appearance on July 10 , it was after a few " really terrible " days for his mother . It was n't the back aches she minded , nor the relentless insomnia , it was the fact that the storm over Milo had left her " deeply hurt inside " and that she felt she had nobody to turn to . " Nobody ? not even your mother , nor your friends ? can take the place of a husband who loves you , " she said later . " I never felt so alone in my life . " But once she 'd held her baby , once she 'd decided that he had " all of his father 's looks and charm , " she was once again her own upbeat self . Her first move on Day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ announcement she 'd already drawn and get them in the mail . Like zillions of other such cards , hers gives the baby 's name , weight , length , time and date of birth . But there is one ingredient on Kim 's announcement that is unique : printed across the bottom of the card , under a typical " Love is . . . " drawing , are the words , " Parents : Kim and the late Roberto ( posthumously by artificial insemination ) . "
