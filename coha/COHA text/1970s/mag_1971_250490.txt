The Santa Barbara , Calif. , Chamber of Commerce does not include Sanford Darling 's home on its tour of local attractions , but perhaps it should . TIME Correspondent Timothy Tyler visited Darling 's small frame house on Rancheria Street . His report : <P> Just when it seemed that life was about over for Sanford Darling , it started all over again . It happened one day when Darling , already 68 years old , was standing on his front lawn , trying to decide what color to paint his house . He stood there stooped , red-faced and wrinkled from a not very eventful life : a poor , fatherless adolescence ; ten restless years as a chiropractor , a calling that he gave up because the hours were too long ; 27 years as a technician for Mobil Oil , interrupted by frequent golf and fishing trips ; the death , on his retirement , of his wife ; and then a six-month Grand Tour , followed by his return to Santa Barbara , where he slowly learned to cook his own meals and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much that he repeated it the following year . Now , as he stood contemplating his small frame house , visions of beautiful ladies in Thailand and Singapore , heaving ships at sea , castles on the Rhine bubbled through his brain . He seized his 3-in. brush and green semigloss enamel and began to paint a small grass hut on one wall . It was n't bad , considering that he had never painted a picture in his life . By the end of the day , the wall was decorated with glassy-eyed maidens and churning waves , and Sanford Darling had found a new career . <P> Beguiling Maidens . " Anything that was flat , I painted a picture on , " recalls Darling , his blue eyes glowing . On his pitched roof , he painted an impressionistic harbor scene with sailboats , white mountains and a shining lighthouse that can be seen two blocks away . He soon discovered that the compressed cardboard backs of old television sets had just the right absorptive quality for the semigloss house paint he favored ; he painted scenes on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hands on , and mounted them on the outside walls of his house . In his artistic development , Darling went through a fairly long Cezanne period and had an affair with early Grandma Moses . In his short Renoir stage , he managed to get the soft wispy effect in his tree leaves by dabbing on latex paint with an ordinary shaving brush . When he was under the Turner influence , he found he could create raging waves by running a dry thumb across Sherwin-Williams Aqua CE 640 . <P> As a visitor approaches Darling 's house today , he is confronted by a bewildering jumble of wild colors . He walks along a cement path adorned with Oriental mountains , and climbs a porch whose walls are filled with the birds , bears and skunks of Yellowstone National Park . He passes through a Mount Fuji screen door and walks upon upside-down rugs that glow with still lifes . He sits in a leatherette armchair covered with a rushing river in an idyllic field of gold , and rests his feet upon a footstool that depicts a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snake-infested pagodas , grass huts and beguiling maidens . In the kitchen , the refrigerator door opens onto another pastoral scene ; the garbage can is early Picasso .
