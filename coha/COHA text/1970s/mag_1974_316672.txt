" Over this past weekend we initiated a voluntary program to monitor grain exports . " <P> <P> Tucked into President Ford 's economic speech , the statement failed to command much attention at first . Yet the new program , under which traders are asked to seek Department of Agriculture approval of all sales abroad exceeding 50,000 tons of grain at one shot or 100,000 tons in a week , set off a wave of international jitters even as it aimed at holding down prices at home . <P> By informally controlling grain exports , the Administration hopes to forestall such embarrassments as the " holding in abeyance " on Oct. 5 of $500 million worth of corn and wheat contracted for by the Soviet Union . Having too hastily assumed , on the basis of talks between Ambassador Anatoly Dobrynin and Agriculture Secretary Earl Butz in late September , that the Russians were interested only in " modest " purchases of a million tons or so , the White House was startled to learn early this month that between 5 million and 10 million tons of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called in executives of the Continental Grain Co. and Cook Industries and persuaded them to hold back on their contracts to sell the Soviets a total of 3.4 million tons . Some of that grain ultimately may be shipped to Russia . Last week Treasury Secretary William Simon went to Moscow to discuss the matter . <P> <P> Cook Industries President Edward Cook said he was told at the White House that halting the grain deal was a " political " gesture and " that if we did n't cancel the sale , Congress would impose mandatory export controls . " The grain sale was held back on the eve of the Administration 's economic proposals , and Ford was clearly not eager to have the inflationary specter of a large grain export dangling before the public-and the Democrats . The Republicans and the nation are still smarting from the " great grain robbery " of 1972 , when the Soviets secretly bought up some 25% of America 's wheat crop plus much corn . <P> Sizable grain exports would seem unwise in the light of this year 's crop drop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1.8 billion bushels , - up 4% from last year , but they are the cheerful exception . Floods , drought and early fall frost have sharply reduced crops . The Agriculture Department , which raised the hopes of foreign buyers by grossly overestimating the size of the crop earlier this year , released its latest forecasts last week . The corn harvest may come to 4.7 billion bushels , down 16% from last year ; and soybeans to 1.3 billion bushels , down 19%.
