Romero fights for the peasants <P> Even by Central American standards , El Salvador is a vastly overpopulated , poverty-ridden feudal society . The elite 1.9% of the population , which owns 57.5% of the land , sells cash crops abroad while at home hunger and malnutrition are endemic . The oligarchy 's prosperity depends upon plentiful cheap labor from landless , job-hungry campesinos , and , fearing bloody rebellion , it will do almost anything to prevent the peasantry from organizing . To eliminate political dissent , a sweeping new law decrees prison for anyone who perturbs the " tranquillity or security of the country " or " the stability of public values . " <P> The people are left with one powerful ally who is not intimidated : Oscar Arnulfo Romero y Galdames , 60 , the Roman Catholic Archbishop of San Salvador . Typically , high-ranking Latin churchmen mute their protests ; some are merely props of their regimes . Though many priests and some bishops have made brave stands , Romero , since he took office early last year , has been the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a meeting with Pope Paul last fortnight , Romero ascended the pulpit of his still unfinished cathedral and unleashed one of his regular hour-long sermons about the tyranny and terror all around him . He is a small man and his voice is low-keyed , but it is strong and steady . Newspapers almost daily vilify him as corrupt , insane , as a Communist , as a man who " sells his soul to the Devil . " They never print the news his sermons contain . <P> Mothers of political prisoners are continuing then-hunger strike at the Salvadorean Red Cross , he reports , and two laymen who appeared to support them have disappeared . Two peasants have been beaten to death . Two priests on pastoral missions and a professor of medicine have been seized by the police , the latter also denied necessary medical treatment . On and on goes his litany of outrage . <P> Romero , a telegraph operator 's son who entered seminary at 13 , was known as a conservative but also as a man of the people . He started speaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Within weeks a priest and two companions were machine-gunned , their bodies riddled with the type of bullets used by the police . The right-wing " White Warriors ' Union , " a pro-government vigilante group with ties to business , killed another priest to avenge an assassination by left-wing terrorists . Next , the White Warriors vowed to execute the 47 Jesuits in El Salvador unless they left the country in 30 days . The Jesuits stayed , and so far none have been murdered , but it is clear that they , indeed all active Catholics , face harassment , torture and death at the hands of the vigilantes , the national police and the dreaded 50,000-member " Orden " militia . This past Easter at least 29 people were killed in a vicious raid on an area where the Christian Peasants ' Federation was active .
