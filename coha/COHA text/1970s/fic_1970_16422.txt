We now see Mark and Daria in a different location :  --  85  --  &nbsp; DARIAWhen somebody says a small town is there one special picture that always comes to your mind ? Mark nods and smiles . &nbsp; DARIAIs it a real town ? &nbsp; MARKNo . &nbsp; DARIAHow do you know ? &nbsp; MARKIt does n't have any parking meters . &nbsp; DARIAMy small town has white frame houses down a tree-lined street .

What are you doing out here anyway ? Phoenix ? Was that for real ? &nbsp; DARIAMy boss wants me there .

It 's peaceful here . &nbsp; MARKIt 's dead . &nbsp; DARIAO.K . It 's dead . So let 's play a death 's game . You start at one end of the valley and I 'll start at the other and we 'll see who can kill the most . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to mice and rabbits . If we 're lucky we might find an antelope . At the end we 'll count up how many deaths each of us has and the winner will get a special prize : the right to kill the loser . Sound like fun ? &nbsp; MARK ( deadpan ) Sounds great . &nbsp; DARIAThe only trouble is , the winner wo n't have anyone to play with when it 's over . ( pause ) He 'll just wander around through all these corpses and all of this sand and finally drop dead with the rest of them . And one day about a million years from now some moon people will come by here and take a look around and say : " Just like we thought . Not a living soul . "  --  92  --  94 The valley has changed color as the sun moves around . The shadows have shifted . We see Mark and Daria making love .

Bonnie ( 11/20/68 )  --  93  --  95 EXT . ZABRISKIE POINT - DAY Up on the lookout the car radio plays a tune . . . . The sense of panic there before in gazing down into that prehistoric lake has gone , leaving a soft serene atmosphere in its wake . 96 EXT . VALLEY FLOOR - DAY Beside Daria and Mark are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their love-making is tranquil and warm . A little further off another couple are laughing and joking : the phase that goes before love . Then they kiss and stretch out on the earth . 97 More couples suddenly appear on the hills around . Gradually the couples become more numerous . 98 Strewn across the desert from horizon to horizon there are thousands of young boys and girls all making love . There is not only love between both sexes , but also between boys with other boys , and girls with girls .  --  94  --  99 After a bit , a light breeze springs up . Then it blows harder and harder . All the boys and girls have to quit their love-making . They stand up . The wind is blowing so hard now they have trouble even standing up . Great gusts of dust blow into their faces so they can hardly breathe . They struggle away through the dust , towards any shelter they can find - hand in hand . They have their arms around one another as they push ahead . The hot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a whiplash - a screaming curtain of black dust against which the young couples are seen battling desperately , as they appear now and then in the distance . 100 A slight breeze ruffles the hair of Mark and Daria . They come out of their embrace . They look at each other . They smile . They are alone again . pp. 34-65 &nbsp; pp. 95-117 101 EXT . ZABRISKIE POINT - DAY El Dorado Dodge camper with boat attached . A large motorcar has driven up onto the lookout heralded by pointless honks on the horn . It has a trailer ( with boat ) clanking along behind . The hideous thing stops with a screech of brakes in the center of the lookout.  --  95  --  Two people get out : a man stripped to the waist , flabby looking ; and a fat girl in short pants , both laughing and giggling . On the back seat of the car is a small child licking an ice cream . They go to a little wall and look around at the landscape . &nbsp; MANThey should build a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &nbsp; WOMANGreat idea . Maybe you should do it . The man gives out an exclamation which means : all balls - the Drive-in , the pop-corn , the landscape , everything . He turns and walks back to the car . Then he gets in . He puts on the radio which instantly starts blaring out a cheerful stupid commercial , which over-whelms all voices and sounds , including the music from Daria 's car radio .  --  96  --  102 EXT . VALLEY FLOOR - DAY Mark and Daria are now standing up , ready to come back to the lookout. 103 EXT . ZABRISKIE POINT - DAY The car with the tourists is driving slowly down the ramp and onto the highway as the sound of the radio dies slowly away into the roar of the engine . The music is over too . 104 EXT . ZABRISKIE POINT - DAY Mark and Daria have just reached the spot where the two lavatories are when they hear another noise : An approaching police car . The boy sees the policeman and rushes into the Men 's and shuts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same , into the Women 's but the cop has stopped at the side of the road and they see her . The girl then stops and waits . The cop comes over to her . Daria is now only a few steps away from the cop who is armed to the teeth but she does n't bat an eye . &nbsp; COPHaving trouble ?  --  97  --  &nbsp; DARIAOh - Uh - No . I was just going to the bathroom . &nbsp; COPWhere 's your car ? &nbsp; DARIAI left it . Along with my driver 's license , my Bank-Americard , my Traveller 's checks , my social security number , my birth certificate , my . . . . and . . . . . The cops looks arround . Absolute stillness again . You ca n't see where the car is parked from where they are . The highway is far in the distance and out of sight . One cop is about forty and a strong he-man . He seems to be wondering whether he could take her . A few moments of tension @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stands there quietly , her arms loosely hanging , looking at the policeman and smiling . The smile does it . He walks away .  --  98  --  &nbsp; DARIABye. 105 He has scarcely gone twenty yards when Mark comes out of the Men 's . Room . He pulls out his gun and slowly points it at the policeman who is pulling away in his car . Mark takes careful aim . &nbsp; DARIAMan , you 're really crazy . Is it loaded ? &nbsp; MARKNaw . He opens the cartridge chamber - the bullets fall onto the sand . There is a pause and he begins digging at the earth with his heel . &nbsp; DARIADigging for water ? &nbsp; MARKI 'm going to bury it . 106 There is another pause . &nbsp; DARIAWhy did you ask me about the strike ? Were you there ?  --  99  --  &nbsp; MARKYeah . . . &nbsp; DARIAThe guy who killed the cop . . . She realizes . Long silence . &nbsp; MARKNo . I wanted to , but . . . somebody else was there . &nbsp; DARIABut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they ! &nbsp; DARIAOn the radio . &nbsp; MARKI never got off a shot . We should shoot them all and I ca n't even shoot one . He kicks the bullets - Daria gets down on her hands and knees and starts picking up the bullets . &nbsp; DARIAYou 'll need them . You 're going to have a hard time making them believe you .  --  100  --  &nbsp; MARKI ai n't gon na try . &nbsp; DARIAWhy ? I believe you . . . She kneels beside him , touches his legs . &nbsp; MARKI do n't know . &nbsp; DARIAYou would n't be copping out . . . &nbsp; MARKThere 's no difference between a cop-out and what people think is a cop-out . &nbsp; DARIABut what about what really happened ? Does n't that matter at all ? &nbsp; MARKYeah . Sometimes , I guess . But not in this country now . Anyway , what matters for me is to get another turn . ( ALTERNATE LINE : ) But what matters for me is what I 'll do next . ( quietly ) There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DARIALet 's go back to the car . We can drive out of here . If you cut your hair they 'd never recognize you . &nbsp; MARKDo I need a haircut ? &nbsp; DARIANo . You look beautiful . Silence . Mark and Daria walk back up the hill , towards the car .  --  102  --  107 EXT . DRY LAKE - DAY Daria and Mark are on the dry lake near the stolen plane . It is now partly painted in very loud , vulgar colors . We read the words : " FREE COME " , " NO WAR " There are huge paintings of male and female sex organs  --  so intricately drawn that it is hard , at first , to see them . Mark is doing the painting . Daria is putting flowers and flourishes over the figurative violence . Mark puts down the brush , and looks at the plane . &nbsp; MARKYou know . . . they might not even think it 's a plane - - " Strange , prehistoric bird spotted over Mojave desert with its ' genitals out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing back to L.A. &nbsp; MARKSure . You do n't just borrow someone 's private plane , take it for a joy ride and never come back to express your thanks . He paints the word " thanks " on , very small .  --  103  --  &nbsp; OLD MANIt 's nice to see a young man show some respect . The old man is painting on the nose of the plane . &nbsp; OLD MANCome over here . &nbsp; MARK ( to old man ) Looks pretty great . &nbsp; OLD MANSure is . Daria crosses over toward Mark . &nbsp; DARIADo you really think you have a chance ? &nbsp; MARKI 'll just set it down on the runway far enough from the tower so I can make it into this field . From there I 've got it made . I 'll be in town before they know what 's happening . &nbsp; DARIABut why take it back ? You could just ditch it here and ride with me to Phoenix . You do n't even have to take the risk of . . .  --  104  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back , admires his artistry - as they old man walks away picking up a portable radio on the way . &nbsp; MARKDo n't you think she looks beautiful ? &nbsp; DARIA ( nods ) Yes . Mark says good bye to Daria , gets in plane and takes off . Daria waves him farewell on the ground . When he is out of sight , she walks back to the old shack , and spends a moment with the old man . &nbsp; OLDMANBye , Bye Lady . God Bless You . &nbsp; DARIABye , bye . Thanks . . . Bye , bye . She gets into her car and drives away from the dry lake . 108 EXT . DESERT HIGHWAY - DAY ( #6 ) The car is streaking again down another long endless highway cutting through a fantastically desolate landscape .  --  105  --  But Daria is n't looking at the country . She is gazing up at the twists and loops of a gaily painted little airplane. 109 INT . AIRPLANE - DAY Mark waves down to her before disappearing . 110 EXT .

AIRPLANE - DAY Mark notices them from the control cabin and sees they are police . He attempts to get the plane up again , to escape , but it is too late , one wheel has already touched down and the plane shudders badly . 119 EXT . CIVIL AIRPORT - DAY All the boy can do is to get the plane landed as well as he can . The police cars hug it on three sides . The plane tries to go off the runway into the open country across the flat expanse of grass . But he finds one of the police cars blocking the way .

The policeman fires : one , two , three , four times . The plane looks as though it has been shot dead . It does a terrible swerve then slows to a halt in the grassy area off the runway .

COUNTRY HOUSE LIVING ROOM - DAY Inside the house , in a large living room , a meeting is taking place between the lawyer and several businessmen . They are all seated around a table starting at a big aerial photograph of desert land with little flags sticking up . They are two groups facing each other : the lawyer and his associates on one side . On the opposite side the businessmen , who appear to be trying to conclude the important deal .  --  112  --  &nbsp; BUSINESSMAN #1Well , Lee , if these are your final conditions I ca n't see how I can possibly submit them to our associates . A proposal like this is just . . . unacceptable . &nbsp; LAWYERListen Jack , you know as well as I do that the price @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to its potential use . Right ? So , the question is  --  is this land of value to your people or not . . . ? &nbsp; BUSINESSMAN #3Well , frankly , I do n't think that it is . We certainly do n't want to get in over our heads any more than you people do . ( We ca n't take a chance of getting in over our heads any more than you are ) Silence . The lawyer 's associate looks at the group in front of him and watches their faces as though looking for a sign that they 're bluffing . Then the lawyer motions toward the terrace and they leave the businessmen to discuss it among themselves for a while .  --  113  --  Still silence in the living room . They light cigarettes , pour drinks and ad lib conversation by associate #2. 123 EXT . COUNTRY HOUSE TERRACE - DUSK &nbsp; ASSOCIATEWhat do you think , Counselor ?

( up here ) He heads back to where the meeting is . Daria stares after him a moment then moves down the stairs slowly . She stops in front of the door and stares into space as though not realizing where she is or how she got there . She hears a rustling sound and her eyes open . A pretty Indian maid , around her own age , appears in front of her , and passes on her way upstairs . Suddenly Daria turns around and knows she wants to be anywhere but inside this house with these people , involved in this world . She runs out the glass door , up the hill to the side of the house and heads for her car .  --  116  --  128 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ COUNTRY HOUSE DRIVEWAY - DUSK She reaches her car and jumps in .
