There will be a small farewell party at San Clemente this week , probably a mixture of tears and forced gaiety . The six-month period of federally subsidized transition is ending for former President Richard Nixon on Feb. 9 , and with it a fleet of Government cars , caretakers , telephone operators , and the salaries for much of his staff . He will now have to get along on his $60,000 annual pension , plus $200,000 a year to operate an office , and whatever he can earn by writing about his unique career in politics . Nixon has received part of his $175,000 advance from Warner Paperback Library , the publisher of his memoirs . <P> Recent visitors to Nixon 's Casa Pacifica compound report that his spirits and his health have taken an upturn . Actually , the dwindling staff seems more depressed than the boss . " How much can you walk on the beach ? " asked one youthful aide last week . " We have developed a special bond with each other ; we depend so much on each other . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Ghost Town . Originally , 22 Washington aides followed Nixon to San Clemente , most of them still drawing their Government salaries . Concerned about their future , many have left . With the departure this week of another half a dozen , only five full-time aides will remain , including Personal Secretary Rose Mary Woods and former Nixon Speechwriter Franklin Gannon , who will help research Nixon 's memoirs . He will draw a $34,000 salary . There will still be some 30 Secret Service men alternating duty in protecting the Nixons , but generally , lamented one departing secretary , " it will be a ghost town around here ; it 's really sad . " <P> Former Press Secretary Ronald Ziegler will remain a " voluntary consultant " to Nixon on a part-time basis . In preparation for a career on the college lecture circuit , Ziegler has let his hair grow longer and allowed photographers to snap him riding a motorcycle and playing drums . But that career is off to a shaky start . Student-government groups at both Boston University and Michigan State voted not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be free to speak , all right , but not at student expense . B.U. President John Silber later re-invited Ziegler in the interest of free speech , offering to pay him $1,000 in university funds , but Ziegler 's agent rejected that as too small . Silber observed that " the process of Ziegler 's mind provides excellent material for a textbook on logical fallacies . " <P> Rose Mary Woods will continue to serve Nixon in Washington , drawing a $42,000 salary out of his federal office allotment . She has been zealously guarding Nixon 's varied left-behind memorabilia and fuming at court orders that impounded them . Both Nixon 's attorneys and the special prosecutor 's staff last week asked Federal Judge Charles Richey to permit the transfer to Nixon of such items as his reading glasses , a wedding picture of Tricia , and his collection of elephants and gavels . Friends find her bitter and , according to one , " pretty worn down with the frustration and the pettiness she encounters . "            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
