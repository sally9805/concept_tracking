Since her death ten years ago this week , Marilyn Monroe has attained the pop pantheon of nostalgia . Books have been written about her , poems have apostrophized her and artists from Andy Warhol to Claes Oldenburg have portrayed her in painting and sculpture . Now , to celebrate-and cash in on-her legend as the last of the movie sex goddesses , Los Angeles Journalist Larry Schiller has collected 185 photographs of Marilyn by 15 top photographers for an exhibition at Los Angeles ' David Stuart Galleries . <P> As the samples on this page indicate , the photographs trace Marilyn 's growth from teen-ager to star , catching her in all of her many moods . " I wanted to show how she changed , " says Schiller , " from pimples and pigtails , in and out of baby fat as she went through traumas . " Schiller is preparing 30 copies of the exhibition to tour other U.S. cities , and he is also negotiating with several book publishers to reproduce it in a hard-cover memento of the Monroe magic .    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
