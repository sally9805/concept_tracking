In the cities and towns of Israel last week , the people had reason to rejoice . It was Passover week , when families celebrate the flight from Egypt more than 3,000 years ago . The populace also had a grand secular occasion to celebrate : the upset victory ( 78 to 77 ) of a Tel Aviv basketball team over Italy in the European championship at Belgrade . <P> Once the game was finished , however , those who stayed tuned to Israeli radio and TV heard a shocking message . Premier Yitzhak Rabin , 55 , had waited for game 's end to take to the air waves and declare another stunning upset-his own . Rabin announced to the country that he would not lead his ruling Labor Party in the May 17 elections - and that he wanted to resign immediately . His reason : he and his wife Leah had held two U.S. bank accounts in violation of Israeli law , and their value was far higher than the couple had earlier admitted . <P> Little Choice . Rabin had little choice in resigning , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Israel 's foreign currency laws . His stepping down , said a grim Rabin , was a " sad end " to a three-year political stewardship . Finance Minister Yehoshua Rabinowitz had another phrase for it : " the biggest political crisis in the history of the state of Israel . " <P> The seeds of Rabin 's humiliating downfall had been germinating for weeks , ever since the Tel Aviv daily newspaper Ha'aretz reported that the Premier 's wife had held a bank account in Washington for the past four years ( TIME , March 28 ) . It is illegal for Israeli citizens to keep money abroad without special permission , and Mrs. Rabin had not sought such permission . She provided an explanation that sounded convincing enough at the time : the account at the National Bank of Washington , which amounted to about $2,000 , was an old one , dating from the years ( 1968-73 ) when Rabin served as Israel 's Ambassador to the U.S. <P> Though his wife was in charge of family finances , Rabin was co-signer on the account , and . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as hers . " A lawyer for the couple also said that the Rabins had been unaware that a foreign account such as theirs had to be closed within a reasonable time after their return to Israel . <P> The Rabins ' apparent candor and the small amount of money involved made the incident seem forgivable to the Israeli public . The feeling was that Rabin would escape with a substantial fine-but with his career intact . <P> But the Rabins had not told the whole story . As Finance Ministry officials went over the bank records , they discovered a second account , containing nearly $6,000 . In all , the Rabins had $18,700 in the two accounts when they left Washington , and they had transferred only some $10,500 back home . Israel 's Attorney General Aharon Barak decided that the matter was serious enough to justify calling in the state prosecutor to investigate further . He also decided that Mrs. Rabin bears responsibility for the accounts ; if found guilty in court , she could face up to three years in jail or a heavy fine . Confronted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Labor Party members began demanding Rabin 's resignation .
