into collapsing sails , crashing masts and dying men . Smoke and the size of the ships made maneuvering and identification almost impossible . As the October day wore on , the French and Spanish ships struck their colors . Nelson , who had covered his medals with a handkerchief when he was wounded so his men would not know who was being carried below to die , was told the news . " Thank God , I have done my duty , " he said , and asked that his hair be sent back to Emma Hamilton , that his body not be thrown overboard ( it was put in a cask filled with brandy and returned to London for the funeral ) . Trafalgar changed the course of history , weakening the alliance of Spain and France , and making possible the great Victorian Empire . The course of ship design was altered too , the smaller , more manageable ships rising both in commercial and naval construction . The sea would be England 's for the next 100 years , but the nation wondered whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greatest sailor . In London 's Trafalgar Square , from a column built just high enough to give him a view of the sea , Nelson 's statue gazes eternally out to the restless water that gave him his death and his immortality . The race to end all races June 1866 . Two clipper ships , Ariel and Taeping loaded with the first tea of the season , burst out of the harbor of Foochow in what would be remembered as the race of all time . Through 15,000 miles of sea , alternately crashing and calm , the two ships tore the waves , setting every inch of canvas to catch each wisp and gust of wind . They were at sea a hundred days , and when finally Ariel and Taeping ratcheted up the choppy waters of the English Channel , not a sailor heard the music or the cheers of the crowds , nor even saw the White Cliffs of Dover though the seamen had n't been home in a year ; they crouched , tensely waiting for any conceivable order from their captains , Keay or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the race . Tea does not travel well . Nor does money wait . A fortune was riding on the cargoes  --  ten shillings a ton plus 100 pounds for the captain for the first tea to hit the London dock . Early arrival meant profit and glory to the company of merchants which might establish in a single voyage what other companies took generations of reliable trading to achieve . Steamers in the Strait of Dover stood in the wash of the leaping ships , watching at once the dawn and the dusk of the great age of sail . The clippers had picked up pilots off Dungeness , Ariel first by five minutes . Bright flecks of foam caught in the wind with the screaming sea gulls who dived in vain behind the ships ; there was no waste on Taeping or Ariel , and no time to toss it overboard had there been .

Taeping and Ariel were adaptations of an American adaptation of a certain Balti- . more clipper schooner which flourished in the 1790 's , establishing a new nation 's daring and distance capabilities among old world monopolies . Refinements sharpened the schooner until she was little more than a knife blade held aloft by moon-raking masts alive with fields of canvas . Night , day , fair or foul , the sails ballooned with the insistent demands of the captains who felt , always at their backs , the urgent claims of the ship 's owners and shareholders . Where men or cargo perished for a destination , the clipper was the answer . Its narrow sides held precious little cargo  --  literally . Fast as a bullet , one clipper made Liverpool from New York in twelve days . The ships ' myriad sails and terrible masts necessitated huge crews .
