At the age of 83 , Kentucky Colonel Harland Sanders , the goateed alchemist who turned fried chicken into gold , is trying to build a new chain of franchised restaurants . They are to be called " Claudia Sanders ' the Colonel 's Lady ' Dinner Houses " - so named after Sanders ' wife , who is said by associates to be " as sweet as the Colonel is cantankerous . " The sitdown restaurants will be quite different from the Kentucky Fried Chicken carry-outs that first made Colonel Sanders a household name . For one thing , a patron will be able to buy lobster-if Sanders can sell franchises . So far , he has not . <P> Last week he brought a $122 million damage suit against Heublein , Inc. , which controls Kentucky Fried . Not that he really needs the money . The Colonel in 1964 sold the system , as well as his " secret formula " and his " Finger Lickin ' Good " slogan for $2 million , and earns $250,000 a year from TV commercials , salary ( $40,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He charges that Heublein has been pressuring potential purchasers of Claudia Sanders franchises . He claims that Heublein scared away his first prospect by threatening legal action for infringement of trademarks . Heublein retorts that the suit is " without merit . " <P> So far , the only Claudia Sanders restaurant is the Colonel 's own , located in Shelbyville , Ky. , where he lives . Thus most fast-food fans will have to travel a long way to find out if the Colonel is as handy with a lobster tail as he is with a chicken leg .
