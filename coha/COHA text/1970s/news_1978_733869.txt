txt WASHINGTON ? How President Carter 's voluntary wage-price guideline program will affect you : It you are an . employe or an executive , you will be asked to hold your annual wage increases , including fringe benefits , to 7 per cent . If you 're a worker subject to a labor contract , the 7 per cent annual standard applies over its life . You could get up to 8 per cent the first year as long as the pay boosts over the life of the contract average out to 7 per cent per year . THE GOVERNMENT is asking companies to divide workers into three groups ? management , union workers , and all other workers . Each group will be asked to meet the 7 per cent standard . The pay standard does not apply to individuals but to the groups . Thus , for a group to hold its pay increases an average 7 per cent level , some within the group could get more than 7 per cent as long as others received less than 7 per cent . Workers earning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voluntary standard . Another exception is this : If your union makes improvement in work rules that improve productivity , higher wage increases would be permitted . IF YOU are a member of a large union , chances are the government will be monitoring your contract closely , and it plans to use some pressure to induce compliance . For example , it plans to review local prevailing wage rates set on federal contract work . These rates tend to influence the rates for all other contracts . The presumption is that the government might threaten to reduce these rates if a union balks at the guidelines . That 's the stick approach . However , // How Carter wage-price controls would affect you // the President 's program contains a carrot for workers . He calls it " real wage insurance . " Actually , it 's a unique tax rebate that resembles a national cost of living escalator clause . It requires legislation . Here 's how it would work : IF YOUR group ? union or not ? meets the standard , and the Consumer Price Index next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is about 7.5 , you would be entitled to a tax refund , The " wage insurance " plan is complex . For example , if you agree to the pay standard , your employer would let the IRS know on the W-2 forms . Then , if the inflation rate accelerated , you would be eligible for a refund automatically . For businesses , the price standard is complex , too . Individual companies are expected to hold their price increases to 9.5 per cent below their average annual rate during 1976 and 1977 . If a company 's price increases went up by an average 6.5 per cent in those two years , it would be expected to hold them to 6 per cent . IF EVERYONE AGREES to this standard , it would result in an overall inflation rate of 6 to 6.5 per cent in 1979 , according to the administration . The government will primarily be watching the big companies ? and will monitor those with annual sales of more than $500 million . As on the wage side , there are significant exceptions . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by 15 per cent , it would be asked to hold price boosts to no more than 9.5 per cent in 1979 . If a company found itself pounded with uncontrollable cost increases and could n't meet the price standard , it would be asked to hold its profit margin to a level no higher than the average of the best two out of the last three years . ALTHOUGH the program is voluntary , the government has some powerful weapons to force compliance . It will require companies on Jan. 1 to certify they are observing the standards before they can receive a government contract . It is somewhat like a loyalty oath . In addition , government purchases will be channeled to those companies observing both the pay and price standards . If a company exceeded the guidelines in an industry where there are specific government protections ? such as import quotes and government price regulations ? it might find action to do away with those protections . A COMPANY that wants to export and wants aid from the Expert-Import Bank will also have to certify that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The government insists it will not require extensive reporting of price increases . Although not mentioned in the President 's speech , administration officials gave these additional details : In the food industry , the profit margin test  --  but not the price guideline  --  will apply . Farm prices are not covered , but the administration said if farmers raised prices too much , it will consider changing agriculture programs that will increase supply , thus depressing prices . TAUS , FOOD PRICES could rise sharply under the program , as long as they coine within the profit test . Doctor 's fees and salaries of state and local employes are covered . Interest rats and dividend payments are not . Administration officials were noncommittal when asked whether the public should write the government to tattle on those it believes in violation of the guidelines . They said they would n't discourage tattlers .
