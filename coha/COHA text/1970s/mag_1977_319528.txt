Since the price of coffee began percolating out of control ( $1.25 to $4-plus per retail pound in 22 months ) some of the nation 's favorite brew has become really hot . According to an FBI spokesman , " hijackers like to keep up with the times ; our biggest headache now is coffee . " The FBI knows of 15 hijackings , in which the total take was $1,728,000 worth of beans . All this black ( or , if you prefer , cream and sugar ) market activity occurred in the Port of New York , which handles nearly half the 2.6 billion pounds of beans the U.S. imports each year . The local FBI hijacking squad is having a tough time cracking the coffee capers . Frets the squad 's boss : " One bean looks like another . " But we tell you , Chief , if Yuban these hijackers , this penny-Savarin country , which is Chock full o ' coffee Nuts , will sigh a mighty Sanka.               @ @ @ @ @ @
