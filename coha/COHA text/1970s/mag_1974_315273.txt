Peace on a Slender Thread <P> Sir / Henry Kissinger is indeed today 's indispensable man April 1 . Personally , I think that is bad . <P> World peace hangs on a slender thread when it depends on the brilliance and gifts of one man who is here today and gone tomorrow . <P> <P> VAL F. MARCHILDON <P> Mountain Iron , Minn . <P> <P> Sir / It is refreshing to find a politician and/or statesman who displays a realistic approach to complex and sometimes potentially explosive situations rather than Utopian rhetoric , while managing a sense of humor and a humanistic quality . <P> Kissinger is truly an American superstar in a time when we sorely need one . <P> <P> MARY MILLER <P> Vincentown , N.J. <P> <P> Sir / It is hard to believe that a man who had to flee Germany as a boy because he was a Jew now thinks that Soviet Jews who wish to flee their country are no concern of ours and should not influence our Government 's position as to whether we give the Soviet Union most-favored-nation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brilliant statesman , but on this particular point he thinks like a bagel . <P> <P> FREDERICK D. ZIGLER <P> Cincinnati <P> Sir / A man who does not make value judgments could be dangerous . A man who does not ask who is right may operate with a blank and pitiless conscience . <P> If the same man happens to be amassing ever greater power and popularity , watch out , world ! A brilliant mind , a passionate ego and an imagination unfettered by any moral absolutes concoct the ultimate delusion : Your savior has come-fall down and worship him . <P> <P> GARY HARDAWAY <P> La Paz , Bolivia <P> Sir / Question in 2074 : Who was Richard Nixon ? Answer : Some politician during the Kissinger era . <P> <P> LISA KOSCHKA <P> Phoenix , Ariz . <P> <P> Formula for Confidence ? <P> <P> Sir / A vote of thanks to Senator James Buckley for so eloquently voicing yet another call for what will best restore popular confidence in Government-the voluntary resignation of the President April 1 . <P> <P> DANIEL GEHRS <P> Goleta , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Senator Buckley 's dread of a sordid , painful impeachment hearing , I see the President 's resignation as an unconstructive way out of our predicament . <P> No one believes that the President is a sparkling example of purity and perfection , and his pretense of infallibility has proved not only obnoxious but disastrous for our nation . Even if it means that we have to have an impeachment trial , let 's clean out all the skeletons , misconceptions and lies , and start again . <P> <P> SUSAN B. WILBURN <P> New Wilmington , Pa . <P> <P> Sir / There are such things in the world , Senator Buckley , as loyalty and gratitude . In the light of your feelings toward <P> President Nixon , it is the wrong man , in my opinion , who is being considered for impeachment . <P> <P> A.E . ALEXANDER <P> New York City <P> Sir / In the ideal solution to Watergate , Congress would impeach President Nixon and thereby destroy his remaining power . Then it would reverse the impeachment because of prejudicial antics by the press @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others . Thus both an irresponsible President and an irresponsible press would get exactly what they deserve . <P> <P> FREDERICK N. HEGGE
