Northwest Airlines Flight 305 began as the most prosaic of milk runs . It started in Washington , D.C. , at 8:30 a.m. last Wednesday , with scheduled stops at Minneapolis , Great Falls and Missoula , Mont. , Portland , Spokane and finally Seattle . What happened en route rivaled Alfred Hitchcock 's more baroque fantasies . In the most elaborate skyjacking ploy in the bizarre history of air piracy , an inconspicuous middle-aged traveler identified on the manifest as " D.B. Cooper " extorted $200,000 from the airline , and apparently foiled any plan of capture by parachuting to safety over southwest Washington State . <P> Whoever the latest air pirate is , he obviously had conceived his plan with a lapidary 's attention to detail . Wearing dark glasses and a plain business suit , he boarded the Boeing 727 in Portland and took a seat at the rear . He did nothing to distinguish himself from the other 36 passengers aboard-until he gave a stewardess a note stating his demands . " I thought he was trying to hustle me , " said the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in my purse , and he motioned that I should take it out and read it . " He wanted , upon arrival at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport , the sum of $200,000 and four parachutes . Recalls Passenger Richard Simmons : " I saw one stewardess answer a call , and her face dropped . She looked bewildered and gulped . I guess she learned what was happening then . " <P> She certainly did . The hijacker showed her a briefcase that contained two red cylinders and a tangle of wire . He told her calmly that unless his demands were met he intended to blow up the airplane . She immediately relayed the demands to Captain William W. Scott , who in turn radioed Seattle ground control . Northwest President Donald W. Nyrop quickly issued orders to cooperate fully with the hijacker and " do whatever he demands . " Airline officials were dispatched to round up the money , and a call went out for the four parachutes . <P> The 727 circled the Seattle airport until the hijacker was satisfied that the money and parachutes were ready @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Said Pilot Scott to the men in the control tower : " We will ask you to stay there until we get coordinated with our friend in the back . " <P> Getting Antsy . Says Passenger Barbara Simmons : " It was really strange . When the plane landed , we sat there for 15 minutes , and nobody talked . " As soon as the money and parachutes were brought aboard , the hijacker allowed the passengers and two of the stewardesses to disembark ; however , he demanded that one of the girls , Tina Mucklow , remain on board as a hostage . The hijacker asked to be flown to Mexico . The crew explained that such a flight was out of their ship 's range . At one point the impatient captain told the tower : " This guy is getting antsy . " To underscore the point , the hijacker interrupted an attempt by a Federal Aviation Administration official to board the plane by snapping : " Let 's get this show on the road !
