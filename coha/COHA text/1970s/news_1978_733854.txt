txt RICHMOND LANGSTON , a security guard at a South Side motel , says he 's discouraged by the lack of progress he CPPQ in nnding racial discrimination . " Every day different things instances of bias happen to me from people over sue , whether the police or- somebody else , " he said . " Even the laws discriminate against blacks . " Langton is one of 500 black persons who responded to a Chicago Tribune poll seeking to learn what they think about the quality of their lives . Langston , 63 , was one of the 57 per cent majority who said they believe there has n't been much progress in ending discrimination in the last 10 years . AMONG OTHER findings of the poll : ? The chief concern of blacks here is unemployment or inability to find a job , although nearly half of those surveyed said job opportunities are better now than they were in the 1960s . ?

A large majority of the . blaeks.say they are generally satisfied with their houses or . apartments , and -a majority ' also expressed satisfaction with the neighborhoods in which they live . ? Three-quarters of the respondents contend , however , . that discrimination against blacks in housing is- either increasing oe has not changed much in the last few years .

" Prices on goads are lower in stores in white areas thin they are in black areas : " .

They seem to say it 's enough , that I have tomork with you , but that 's it .. As far as . accepting you as a person , that is n't done . ? ? ? " But I also know of a white . couple living in an all-black neighborhood ' who were harassed by blacks and had to move out . " Mrs. Gibson said she is the target of discrimination in some form " every day " and added , " After a while you think , ; ' Ichis is part " ROBERT CAILLOUET , 45 , a schoolteacher who has been unemployed for a year and formerly was a caseworker.for the Illinois Department of Public Aid ; cited rents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are frequently higher than those paid by whites for similar accommodations ; Calliouet also said that foreigners get preference over native blacks in various government programs . He contended that in training programs blacks are frequently trained on old , worn  --  out equipment and . said that persons planning to emigrate from the Philippines , Thailand , or South Korea  --  o the United States are , trained on new equipment supplieciby the U.S. FREDERICK BUCHANAN , 22 , a first year student at Malcolm X College , is. another respondent who said that discrimination continues . But he ? said it seems more " latent , " explaining , " Deep down , deep inside the individual , not much progress is being made , . " We 're dealing with each other now on more ' equal terms , but we feel no different inside ourselves . A ? lot of it is still a racial thing . " - The poll also indicated that many blacks believe whites are either- hostile to their progress or indifferent to it . Twelve per cent of poll respondents said they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a better break , " but 44 pr cent said whites " want to keep blacks down . " COMMENTING ON this aspect of the poll , - CaUlouet said : " This is not the the blacks answered that they , believe government is operated for the benefit of big Interests . When asked to name which social class they believe they belong to , about two-thirds of the respondents listed themselves as among the " lower " or " working " classes . A third described themselves as in the " middle class . " ON OTHER topic 's related to alienation , more than three-quarters of the blacks agreed with the statement " I ca n't help wondering whether anything Is worth while anymore " and more than a third agreed that " To make money there are no right and wrong ways anymore , only easy ways and hard ways . " About half the blacks polled agreed with the opinion that " Nowdays , a person has to live pretty much for today and let tomorrow take care of itself . " ) And seven out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say , the lot of the average man is getting worse , not better . " . However , such disaffection apparently transcends race , for the separate poll of whites showed that almost half agreed with the majority of-blacks on the prospects for the average man . Regarding the statement that " Most public officials are not really interested in the problems of the average man , " nearly 8 of 10 blacks agreed . THIS RESPONSE could explain why the blacks gave low marks to governmental leaders at every level for their performance . Only a third said President Carter was doing an " excellent " or " good " job ; only a fifth gave such above-average grades to Gov . Thompson , and only an eighth gave them to Mayor Bilandic . Their disapproval of public officials cuts across party lines , but blacks generally remain attached to some degree to the Democratic Party , the poll found . Two-thirds identified themselves as Democrats and only 5 per cent said they are Republicans . The balance said they are independents or belong to some other party . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half said they are closer to the Democrats than to Republicans and half said they lean toward neither party . THE POLL also found ether factors that could contribute to the pessimism expressed by blacks . Topping the list by a wide percentage is fear of unemployment , followed by concern about crime and violence , inflation , and continuing discrimination . Instability of family life could also be a factor . A third of those polled said they are widoWed , separated , or divorced . Moreover , it is possible that declining interest in religion , long a mainstay of some black families , could contribute to the alienation expressed . ONE QUESTION was , " Compared with five years ago , do you attend religious services more frequently or less frequently than you did then ? " More than half the respondents said , " Less frequently . " Roughly a fifth said , " About the same , " and a quarter said , " More frequently . " One respondent , Fletcher , Williams , 23 , a student training to be a dispensing optician , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to church mainly because of my parents . But I think people now realize - that you do n't have to go to church to have a clear conscience about your life . " Too many people just go to church to show off their clothes , anyway . I do n't need to go to church for that , But I still have a lot of respect for the church . It 's still one of the black community 's most powerful organizations , I think the church would draw more young people back if it would get itself more involved in helping people with their biggest problems today ? jobs and education . " feeling of each individual white . Our system is based on profit-making , and there has to be a supply of cheap labor . To keep that supply , they have to keep blacks in their place . " I guess the discrimination is more in the system than an individual thing , and we 're all caught up in It . " . Mrs. Jiles said : " It seems to me they do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeling they 'd like to keep us down . " auchanan 's opinion differed , as did Langston 's . " There 's always been good white people , " Langston said . When I was a youth in Mississippi , " a white doctor wanted to send me to school ? to a white school  --  to become a doctor . That was in 1025 , too . " PREVAILING attitudes among blacks regarding what they believe to be persistent patterns of discrimination might account for a feeling of alienation from society expressed by blacks in the poll . There was a series ' of questions on this subject , the first of which was , ' W ould ' you say that government is pretty much run by a few big interests , looking out for themselves , or that it is run for the benefit of all the people . " To this more than ' three-quarters of Monday : For many , crime and the police are both perceived as problems .                @ @ @ @ @
