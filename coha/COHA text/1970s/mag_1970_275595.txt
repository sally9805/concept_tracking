ZECKENDORF : THE AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF WILLIAM ZECKENDORF , with Edward McCreary. 312 pages . Holt , Rineharf &; Winston . $7.95 . <P> The time is September 1954 . Spyros Skouras , Laurance Rockefeller and William Zeckendorf have just passed through an elaborate security screen to reach a Los Angeles meeting with the suspicious , secretive industrialist Howard Hughes . Through Skouras , Hughes has leaked his intention of selling his enormous holdings to devote the proceeds to medical research . Rockefeller , philanthropist and president of the Chase Manhattan Bank , and Zeckendorf at that time , the extraordinarily successful head of the Webb &; Knapp real estate empire , have come out from New York to buy . <P> The meeting is a waste of time . First Hughes feigns ignorance of its purpose . Then Zeckendorf cuts through the mumbo-jumbo and makes an offer . Hughes rejects it out of hand but has what he wants : a free appraisal of his property 's value from one of the nation 's most astute and best-publicized business brains . <P> The anecdote , among the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Zeckendorf because , win or lose , he has always managed to come out sounding like a winner . After all , a man as shrewd as Howard Hughes would only send for the best . <P> Major in Real Estate . Immodesty becomes few men as well as it does Zeckendorf . Apart from the tangle of overextensions and bad luck that resulted in the collapse of Webb &; Knapp in 1965 , Zeckendorf seems to have little to be modest about . The son of a Long Island shoe manufacturer , he dropped out of high school , but entered college after attending a cram school and completing 16 regents ' exams in one week . In 1925 , after three years of parties and football , he dropped college to major in real estate . <P> During World War II , Zeckendorf won a reputation as an astute real estate manager by increasing the value of Naval Commander Vincent Astor 's properties by $15 million . But it was the postwar building boom that finally made the ambitious and by now well-seasoned Zeckendorf a " bee in clover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an economic snowball operation . You find a good property , make a minimal down payment , borrow as much as possible at low interest , then sell high to finance the next deal . In addition to having an uncanny instinct for all the complex variations of this pattern , Zeckendorf had the vision to expand beyond New York into the fastest-growing areas in the country . <P> Together with Architect I.M. Pei , he helped rebuild whole sections of Denver and Dallas . The two men were also prime movers in the renovation of southwest Washington , D.C. , which began in the early 50s , and in the planning and building of the imposing Place Ville-Marie in Montreal . Zeckendorf devotes a major part of his book to detailing each venture . Outer leases , inner leases , sandwich leases , varieties of mortgages and credit , fees simple and not so simple-all are juggled so adeptly that even if the layman does n't fully understand them , he is dazzled by the performance .              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
