ARTHUR REX : <P> A LEGENDARY NOVEL <P> by Thomas Berger Delacorte ; <P> 499 pages ; $10.95 <P> The legends of King Arthur are a natural subject for novelists . T.H. White produced an eloquent contemporary version in The Once and Future King , and only two years ago , the late John Steinbeck 's dull but competent retelling of Le Morte d'Arthur , Sir Thomas Malory 's 15th century compilation , was published . Now Thomas Berger offers still another rex redux , in the form of " a legendary novel . " He might have done better to call it a haphazard parody . <P> In his earlier novels , Berger proved himself a fine minor portraitist of the hapless , tough-talking American male : the middleclass , victimized hero of the Reinhart trilogy , the used-car salesmen and small-time gangsters in Sneaky People . Little Big Man , his burlesque epic of the wild West , and Who Is Teddy Villanova ? , a brilliant imitation of the private-eye novel , displayed a notable talent for satire . <P> Arthur Rex features hard-boiled knights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has the discordant ring of crossed lances at a joust . His heroes talk obsessively of " paps " and " mammets " ( not , as Berger supposes , a variant of mammaries , but a medieval reference to Muhammad ) . The labored effort to reproduce Malory 's diction is a disaster . Horses are " sore thirsty , " kings are " some vexed , " lusty knights " swyve " damsels , addressed elsewhere as " chicks . " Launcelot is said to have " filled a need for the queen , " a disheartening summation of one of the world 's most fabled love affairs . <P> Berger 's borrowings from Le Morte d'Arthur are eccentric . At times , he hovers close to the celebrated tale of King Arthur and the knights of the Round Table , chronicling their legendary exploits , the magical interventions of Merlin and the quest for the Holy Grail . But his treatment of the romances between Tristram and Isold , Launcelot and Guinevere reads like a medieval version of Couples . Querulous and selfabsorbed , the lovers are made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feminists . " Being a woman , " the author says of Guinevere , " she could not understand honor and justice , for they were invented by men . " The code of chivalry is resurrected in the form of propaganda . Berger is given to writing didactic speeches , and his digressions about good and evil , appropriate for the allegorical literature of the Middle Ages , seem tedious in a contemporary novel . <P> Still , the tales of Camelot are dramatic no matter who tells them . The somber denouement , in which the mortally wounded Arthur restores his invincible sword to the mysterious Lady of the Lake , possesses a grandeur undiminished by familiarity . Aware of the story 's inherent drama , Berger eventually abandons farce in favor of a simple , unadorned narrative . " All men of that time lived and died by legend , " he notes with uncharacteristic fervor , and his homage to those legends is a relief after the showy wit that dominates so many chapters . - James Atlas          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
