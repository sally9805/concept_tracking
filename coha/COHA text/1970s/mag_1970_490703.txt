THE TALK OF THE TOWN Notes and Comment AWORD about judicial mediocrity versus judicial excellence . A week or so ago , Senator Roman L. Hruska , of Nebraska , felt compelled to answer the charges of mediocrity brought against Judge G. Harrold Carswell , President Nixon 's nominee to the Supreme Court of the United States , by remarking , " Even if he were mediocre , there arc a lot of mediocre judges and people and lawyers , and they are entitled to a little representation , are n't they ! ' Wc ca n't have all Brandeises , Frankfurters , and Cardozos . " This re min deft us of some words written by Judge Learned Hand , himself one of the supreme jurists of our time ( and a man who did not suffer mediocrities gladly ) , in appreciation of Benjamin Cardozo , shortly after Justice Cardozo 's death , in 1938 . We would like to share those words in these strange times : In all this I have not told you what qualities made it possible for him to find just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constantly guided him to safety . I have not told you , because I do not know . It was wisdom : and like most wisdom , his ran beyond the reasons which he gave for it . And what is wisdom  --  that gift of God which the great prophets of his race exalted ? I do not know ; like you , I know it when I see it , but I can not tell of what it is composed . One ingredient I think I do know : the wise man is the detached man . By that I mean more than detached from his grosser interests  --  his advancement and his gain . Many of us can be that ? I dare to believe that most judges can be , and are , I am thinking of something far more subtly interfused . Our convictions , OUT outlook , the whole makeup of our thinking , which we can not help bringing to the decision of every question , is the creature of our past ; and into our past have been woven all sorts of frustrated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with their corruptions , which , long since forgotten , still determine our conclusions . A wise man is one exempt from the handicap of such a past ; he is a run ner stripped for the race ; he can weigh the conflicting factors of his problem without always finding himself in one scale or the other . Cardozo was such a man ; his gentle nature had in it no acquisitiveness ; he did not use himself as a measure of value ; the secret of his humor  --  a precious gift that he did not wear upon his sleeve  --  lay in his ability to get outside of himself , and look back . Yet from this self-effacement came a power greater than the power of him who ruleth a city . He was wise because his spirit was uncontaminated , because he knew no violence , or hatred , or envy , or jealousy , or ill will . I believe that it was this purity that chiefly made him the judge we so much revere ; more than his learning , his acuteness , and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passion for publicity is a disease , and where swarms of foolish , tawdry moths dash with rapture into its consuming fire , it was a rare good fortune that brought to such eminence a man so reserved , so unassuming , so retiring , so gracious to high and low , and so serene . He is gone , and while the west is still lighted with his radiance , it is well for us to pause and take count of our own coarser selves . He has a lesson to teach us if we care to stop and learn ; a lesson quite at variance with most that we practice , and much that s  --  e profess . One Cent THE British Guiana one-cent magenta , the world 's most valuable stamp , is a small piece of dark-purple paper , roughly an inch square , with smudges on it . The smudges are in fact printing , but they look like smudges . One cvening last week , while the mail strike was still on , this stamp was sold at auction for two hundred and eighty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ballroom of the Waldorf , and it was attended by about eight hundred dealers and collectors . The one-cent magenta was listed in the catalogue as Lot No. 279 , and we got there in time to see Lot No. 86 , a thirty-cent American stamp with the flag inadvertently printed upside down , sold for thirty-two thousand dollars to Irwin Weinberg , of Wilkes-Barre . Later in the evening , Mr. Weinberg bought an airmail stamp with an upside-down airplane for thirty-fou ? thousand dollars , and , eventually , the one-cent magenta itself . Mr. Weinberg is a dealer , and he made his purchases as the representative of a syndicate of eight Pennsylvania lawyers and businessmen who have decided to put their money into stamps . This is a decision that a number of lawyers and businessmen have been making of late . We introduced ourself to Mr. Weinberg shortly after he had acquired the **26;3849;TOOLONG lot  --  he was feeling quite buoyant at that puint  --  and we kept our eye on him for the rest of the evening . A Princeton senior named Joe Lincoln , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since he was a sophomore in high school , told us it was his guess that Mr. Weinberg would go for the big one but would be opposed by the Weill brothers , a formidable pair of dealers from New Orleans . We kept our eye on them , too , and as Lot No. 279 drew nearer and nearer , the Weills looked calmer and calmer , but Mr. Weinberg looked more and more nervous , and kept ducking behind some curtains at the hack of the ballroom . We figured this meant that the Weills were n't going to go for it and Weinberg was . To our gratification , our hunch proved correct . The Weills did n't bid at all , whereas Mr. Weinberg simply stuck his hand in the air and kept it there until all other hands were down . The bidding opened at a hundred thousand dollars and went up in jumps of twenty thousand dollars . A lot of people , including Mr. Weinberg , thought that Mr. Weinberg had acquired a bargain . Robert Price , the former Deputy Mayor of New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard a rumor that a band of English-men were planning a bid in order to buy the stamp for the Queen and that this scared off some of the competition . The one-cent magenta is the only British adhesive stamp that the Queen does n't have . Martin L. Apfelbaum , a dealer from Philadelphia , said that he thought tight money had lopped at least a hundred thousand dollars off the final price . Later , Mr. Weinberg gave a champagne victory party in a suite upstairs . We told him we had been able to tell that he was planning to bid , and he said , " I 've never been an actor , But I was going to buy that stamp . Think how many of the world 's treasures are not for sale . The ' Mona Lisa . ' The Sistine Chapel . " Nonagenarian FIVE years ago , we were asked to the ninetieth-birthday party of Samuel H. Gottscho , a man who since 1925 has been making a living as a photographer  --  first primarily of the stately homes of the rich and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to diminish , primarily of horticulture and nature , which are less affected by the economic climate . We could n't be at the party , but we did get to his ninetyfifth-anniversary celebration a lunch at the Algonquin , attended by more than thirty of his friends and admirers . Mr. Gottscho , a stocky , clean-shaven man with a powerful voice , is as busy as ever . In recent years , his pictures of wild flowers have been on the cover of Audubon Magazine ; last year he made up a book of a hundred color transparencies for Mrs. Flagler Matthews , whose Westchester gardens he has photographed for twenty-seven years ; in 1967 the New York Botanical Garden gave him its Distinguished Service Medal for outstanding botanical photography . " I have seen thousands of horticultural photographs , and of them all I would pick Sam 's as the most beautiful , " said one of the luncheon guests  --  Dr. Harold W. Rickett , the Garden 's senior curator of botany , whose monumental work on the wild flowers of the United States , now partly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Gottscho pictures . " I 'd like to emphasize his artistry . " " His strong point has always been composition , but he has changed with the times , " a man at our left said . " He has discovered crosslighting and backlighting . I think that 's pretty good . A lot of people in photography have never changed . Sam has managed to really swing around . " Later that week , we called on this flexible paragon at his house , in Jamaica , Queens , where he has a file of more than forty thousand nega-tives . ( He has given as many more to the Museum of the City of New York and the Avery Library of Columbia University . ) He gave us a glimpse of his darkroom , which is in the cellar , and then took us up two flights of stairs to his office and opened an album to his first picture  --  a snapshot of the ocean at Coney Island . " August 1 , 1896 , " he said , in a carrying voice . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was horn in Brooklyn , where my father was in wholesale notions and fancy goods . Two of my three sisters are still liv-ing ; one is ninety-three and the other is eighty-three . The third died at eighty-nine . I was a travelling sales-man  --  laces and fabrics  --  until I was fifty , when I switched careers . I trav-elled Pennsylvania and was never with-out my camera . I married in 1910 , and bought this house in 1918 . I began to sell a few pictures on the side in 1916 , and got a hundred dollars from a calendar concern for a photograph of my daughter . After that , I did about twenty calendars . In 1920 , a land-scape contractor had me photograph the plantings of fifty houses in Queens . He paid me three dollars apiece . I wanted to get out of laces and fabrics into professional photography , full-time . I began to photograph houses . I realized you had to interest the architects ; you had to make your-self good enough for the architects . Early in 1925 , I went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could do work as good as what was on the wall . I re-resigned from my company , Voss &; Stern , in May . They gave me a fare-well luncheon and a pair of cufflinks . I went to the Hamptons that summer ; I knew how to handle the aristocratic people . One of my first jobs was the H. H. Rogers estate , in Southhampton , which I photographed for the first Mrs. Rogers . " We pored over some 1925-to-1940 albums , and gazed at the country homes and gardens of bearers of well-publicized names in Long Island , Morristown , Pittsburgh , Palm Beach , Sarasota , Nassau , St. Louis , and Cincinnati . " I spent eight winters in Palm Beach , " Mr. G. said . " Hard work . I was lonesome but happy . All in ail , I did two hundred grand estates . My employers were mostly architects  --  John Russell Pope , Harrie T. Lindeberg , and so on . I never let anyone develop my negatives for me . For years , I worked fourteen hours a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a happy life . During the Depression , to keep busy I travelled five thousand miles by car in Manhattan and Queens , taking pictures of skyscrapers . I got into institutional horticulture in 1940 , with the African Plains of the Bronx Zoo . " Since then , it has been flowers , flowers all the way , from the du Ponts ' Winterthur Gardens , in Delaware , to the wild flowers around a summer house that Mr. Gottscho rents in Southhoid , Long Island , where he goes each year with a widowed daughter and a fifteen-year-old grandson . ( Mrs. Gottscho died in 1961 . ) " All that matters there is the weather , " lie said . " ' Can we photograph this today ? ' All those lovely patches in that part of Long Island ! You never know when the bulldozer will come in , but so far we 've been lucky . Sometimes I do a butterfly  --  on a flower , of course . I once waited forty minutes for a black swallowtail to settle on a thistle . " Trouble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her classroom the other morning and picked up the following pencilled message : REVOLT ! DEAR ERIC : Either we corprals are 4 star genrals or else . Truly yours , BARRY Shirt AGIRL we know who makes movies escorted us last week to a party thrown by Grove Press in honor of a film festival it is sponsoring . The films are a potpourri of imports that have not yet obtained commercial release . The party took place on the ground floor and in the basement of the Village Gate , and when we got there both floors were crowded . David Amram and his quartet were making music on the ground floor , and there was a rock band in the basement . We spent most of the evening on the ground floor , at the request of our escort , whose name is Helen . Helen said , " I really love parties like this , because they are so enormous that you never get a chance to see everyone . Do you know what I mean ? " Helen introduced us to a boy and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about Henri Langlois , who is the founder and director of the Cinemath &que,; the most magnificent film collection in the world . The boy and the girl said they had enjoyed every minute of the six months . " One day , he took us all over Paris to all the apartments he had ever lived in and to all the places where he hid films from the Germans during the war , " the boy said . " Would you like to meet him ? " Helen said she would , and the boy and the girl took us over to a very large man with a very large mustache M. Langlois and Helen took a liking to each other , and chatted for quite a while . Then Helen spotted another friend and broke off to say hello . " Hello , " said Helen . " You 're the lady who wrote the dirty hook . " The lady smiled dimly . " I 'm touched that you remembered , Helen , " she said . " It never did very well , you know . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rights to Mexico and Norway . " Another of Helen 's friends was Richard Schechner , whose Performance Group was responsible for " Dionysus in 69 " and " Makbeth . " Mr. Schechner was wearing an elegant Indian shirt , and was an object of envy . A man came up to him and said , " I bought shirts all over India , and I never found one as nice as that . " " Ah , " said Mr. Schechner . " It 's obvious you were n't a colonialist . " mind the other day when we learned that the Santa Cruz , California , Coast Guard Auxiliary operates a rescue boat named So Long , Darling . President C ? DOUGLAS DILLON , the new . president of the Metropolitan Museum of Art  --  he does not use his full first name , Clarence , which is the fruit of his filial connection with the Dillon of the Wall Street firm of Dillon , Read &; Co. ? was born in Geneva in 1909 , a year that his parents were spending abroad . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was brought up in New York and New Jersey . We met him , by appointment , in the General Motors Building office of the United States &; Foreign Securities Corporation , an investment company in which he has a large interest and of which he is board chairman . He is a tall , blue-eyed , strong-chinned , rather shy man with a high forehead , a receding hairline , and an air of deliberation . " I 've been interested in the Museum since I became a trustee , in 1951 , " he said . " I think I was the youngest fella on the hoard . I was greatly impressed . I 'd always liked beautiful things , but you could n't say that I was a collector then , though my wife was interested in furniture . I went to Paris as ambassador a couple of years later , and we bought a few pictures and some very good French furniture for the Embassy . We visited Versailles and the Louvre , and I got to know the director of the Louvre , Georges Salles . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interested in the whole problem of cultural relations and developed that side of the Embassy work .
