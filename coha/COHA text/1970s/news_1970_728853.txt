txt " Excuse me sir , got any spare change ? " The plea comes not from a long-haired panhandler , but from a giant billboard peering over one of the country 's leading meccas of " youth culture " ? Harvard Square in Cambridge , Mass . An advertisement for Northeast Federal Savings , it is truly a sign of the times . Businessmen in Harvard Square , which borders the ivied walls of Harvard University , have prospered off and even adopted the lingo of the so-called youth culture . Perhaps they have been too successful , for today they fear what they helped create . Drawn by grapevine promises of a youth haven , youngsters from around the country have flooded into the square during spring and summer . Their ranks are swelled by students and the youthful curious from Cambridge and surrounding suburbs . During the summer , Sunday rock concerts on the Cambridge Common and semiweekly big name rock bands sponsored by the Schaefer Brewing Company at the Harvard Stadium draw additional thousands into the square . Along with the youth influx have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and according to merchants , a dip in their business beyond recession woes . To most merchants , the ideal would be to make the youngsters disappear . Arguing against church workers who see the youngsters as a social problem the city must deal with , they say the business community is not equipped to solve social problems . // *Harvard Square quandary Merchants would like the youths to disappear // While Harvard Square 's boutiques , bookstores , foreign restaurants , and shops still present a bustling facade to the shopper , the signs of change are evident . Groups of young people have permanently stationed themselves in the plaza in front of the Holyoke Center , a multistory Harvard office building . Most shop and bank windows in the area have boarded up fronts , covered with graffiti , and political posters . Some shops have wooden frames around their windows so they can quickly nail up boards for protection . Others have shiny new iron grills or metal curtains . Series of disturbances The broken windows are a product of a series of disturbances in the square , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which turned into the first full-scale riot Harvard Square had ever seen . This was followed by three miniriots in the square , one in May and two this summer whose origins still are unclear . On both occasions a few unidentified mimeographed sheets appeared in the square calling for " trashing " ( window-breaking ) . Counterleaflets were distributed by political groups such as Bread and Roses ( a socialist women 's liberation group ) and the People 's Information Center ( a white support group for the Black Panthers ) opposing the trashing . According to church workers familiar with the " street people , " to many of the latter who frequent the square , and to several merchants who were present , most if not all of the actual trashing and looting was nonpolitical and was done by groups of young men , including many blacks , who came from outside of Harvard Square . " On Aug. 5 , about a third of the crowd was angry young blacks who came there to trash , " says Doug Cook , a student at Harvard Divinity School @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to most of the Harvard Square merchants the distinction is not so easily made . " In my opinion , " says Al Zavelle , general manager of the Harvard Cooperative Society  --  one of the square 's largest college stores ? and spokesman for the Harvard Square Businessmen 's Association , " the people squatting in the square are not doing the trashing ? ( although they may be shoplifting , smoking dope , or panhandling . But their very presence brings other groups in . One group uses the other for a cover . " He adds , " And their presence keeps people over 30 out of the square . " While it is difficult to measure exactly how much business is discouraged by youthful panhandlers or fear of riots , everyone is willing to estimate . Business loss estimated The manager of Saks Fifth Avenue men 's store , one of the hardest hit in the summer disturbances , says he lost $10,000 worth of goods on April 15th , suffered $8,000 in physical damage to his store , and feels he has lost about $12,000 in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ president of the Cambridge Trust Bank whose prominently placed windows have suffered $22,000 worth of damage , says his insurance cancellation is on the way . If the windows are " trashed " again , Harvard University , which owns the building , has promised to put in bulletproof , shock-proof plastic substitutes . Perhaps most ironic is the heavy trashing of pricey boutiques , which many street people say exploit the youth market . Pete Peterson , bearded manager of Krackerjacks , whose window insurance was cancelled , says , " The older merchants do n't like us because we deal with the kids . The kids do n't realize that I worked 12 hours a day , six days a week for four years to make this store something . Radicals have come in and asked me to give them goods for nothing . " Since April 15 , he says , he has lowered his prices on many goods . Solutions sought The merchants have been meeting in a series of committees with police , city government , and church workers to try to find " solutions " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ police protection . Since the last disturbance on Aug. 5 when several merchants complained of insufficient police patrols , additional foot patrolmen have been assigned to the square . Also , panhandlers are being warned to move on and large groups are being asked to disperse . A curfew has been placed on the Cambridge Common , but it is not enforced . The mayor has asked for 25 additional policemen , which will cost the city $250,000 a year . After the last two Schaefer concerts , riot patrols in full gear with tear-gas rifles lined Harvard Square to the astonishment of most of the concertgoers . Lighting added Some merchants would like to see Harvard University do more . Says Edward Gruson , vice-president for Community Affairs , " Harvard police are now more often in the area ( of Forbes Plaza ) , and we have added additional lighting . " But , he adds , " The University does n't want to be repressive . " Beyond better police protection , few merchants have suggestions for dealing with the youth . But many would like to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unhappy about the presence of facilities for street people near the square , such as Sanctuary , a free Episcopal church-run hostel , which has hosted about 1,800 visitors for three-night periods , and the Cambridgeport Clinic , which provides free medical care to street people . Square draws people ' But churchmen working with the street people  --  like the Rev. W. Gilbert Dent of the Episcopal church argue that Harvard Square not the hostel , draws people to the square , and that it serves " only to pick people up , and not as a free hotel . " This reporter , visiting Santuary , found about half its residents to be students hitchhiking around the country for the summer . The hostel is locked when disturbances occur , so as not to serve as a haven for Crashers . Mayor Alfred Velluci , who calls Harvard Square " the only live spot in the whole of the Boston area , " would like to see the metropolitan area of Boston and the Cambridge suburbs " whose kids come into Cambridge " sponsor youth activities outside of Harvard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the end , this may be one of the most practical ways of dealing with the needs of merchants and of youth who are not going to disappear .
