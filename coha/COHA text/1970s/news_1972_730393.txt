txt The White House has intervened directly with the automobile industryin an attempt to get the ' four . manufacturers to withdraw their proposed price increases on 1973 model cars . Donald Rumsfeld , director of the ' Cost of Living Council , met ' today at the White House with representatives of American Motors , Chrysler and General Motors . He is scheduled to talk with a Ford executive tomorrow . The White House let it be known that Mr. Rumsfeld had arranged the meetings at the direction of President Nixon . A White House spokesman stopped short of saying that Mr. Rumsfeld had asked the companies not to raise prices , but other authoritative sources said that the purpose of the meetings was " to talk them out of price increases , if possible . " Increases Proposed The Chrysler Corporation , the Ford Motor Company and the General Motors Corporation have applied to the Price Commission for increases averaging $85 to $91 a car to cover costs ' , incurred in meeting Federal emission-control and safety ( standards , particularly the re quirement for stronger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for $78 to cover such costs , plus $68 for Associated Press Donald Rumsfeld what it said were other cost increases . The meetings marked one of the few instances of Administration " jawboning " since the Phase Two program of wageprice controls began last November . In the spring , foodchain executives were summoned to Washington twice to discuss prices of meat and other food . The fact that the White House resorted to this sort of pressure against auto prices was regarded by some observers as suggesting that the Price Commission could find no ground to disapprove the proposed increases . A public commitment by the industry to hold the price line , and absorb any cost increases out of profits , which are up sharply this year , would be an important victory for the Administration 's campaign to dispel inflation psychology . The President and his advisers have been worried that the public is not aware of the slowdown so far this year in the rate of inflation . A decision by the auto industry not to raise prices could be cited by the Administration as dramatic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for General Motors identified its representatives as Thomas A. ? Murphy , vice chairman ; Oscar A. Lundin , executive vice president , and Archie M. Long , controller . Mr. Rumsfeld 's office said that Chrysler was represented by Lynn A. Townsend , chairman ; John J. Riccardo , president , and Roger J. Helder , corporate controller . Representing American Motors were Willian V. Luneburg and fain M. Anderson , Meanwhile , the Price Cornmission disclosed that it had yielded in part to Ralph Nader , the consumer advocate , by promising to hold public hearings before it approved any 1973 model increases . In another development , the Pay Board said today that it had decided not to reduce " at this time " its standard limiting wage and salary increases to 5.5 per cent plus 0.7 per cent for eligible fringe benefits . Mr. Nader sued the Price Commission July 26 , seeking to compel it to hold hearings on the proposed car price increases . Affidavit Filed In a reply affidavit filed late Friday in the Federal District Court here , C. Jackson Grayson Jr. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold hearings before making a decision to grant any of these four companies any price increase on 1973 model automobiles . " In a May 17 letter to Mr. Nader , Mr , Grayson said that because the agency must not disclose information furnished by companies in confidence , a hearing " on individual cases " would not be useful . A Price Commission spokesman said today that the commission could deny the proposed increases without a hear , ing . The spokesman said no confidential company cost data would be disclosed at any , hearing . One of Mr. Nader 's ' purposes in seeking the hearings was to learn more about auto industry pricing and profits . The Pay Board said it would review the wage standard again later in the year " as additional data become available . " That was authoritatively understood to mean that the board felt that several more months of moderation in the upward movement of consumer prices were necessary before labor could reasonably be asked to trim its expectations , The board said that wage trends were " clearly helping to slow inflation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economic stabilization effort last Nov. 14 , the board said , approved increases , covering 13 million employes , have averaged 5 per cent . The index of hourly earnings for nonfarm workers rose at an annual rate of 5.2 per cent from December to July , it noted .
