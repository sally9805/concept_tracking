After covering the enemy corpses with a green rubber poncho , the men who had just killed them stood with bared heads as an Army chaplain conducted a brief funeral service . Intoned Chaplain Michael Chona : " May they rest in peace . O Lord , we implore you to grant this mercy to our dead brothers that they who held fast to your will by their intentions will not receive punishment in return for their deeds .
