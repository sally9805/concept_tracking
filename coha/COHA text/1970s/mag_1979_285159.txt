BANJO DANCING , OR THE 48TH ANNUAL SQUITTERS MOUNTAIN SONG DANCE FOLKLORE CONVENTION AND BANJO CONTEST AND HOW I LOST <P> His head sports the pagan curls of a young Harpo Marx , and his face and body quiver with some of the same nutty , berserk humor . But native Chicagoan Stephen Wade , 26 , has a great deal more to offer than that . <P> He is an impassioned banjoist , a nimbly authoritative clog dancer , a soulful singer of folk music and an enthralling tall-tale raconteur . He gyrates to the pipes of Pan . He is making his theatrical debut in Chicago 's Body Politic Theater , in an evening of intimate , unmarred intensity . <P> When Wade hunches over his banjo , he is a figure of rapturous communion , a man lost in a love affair with an instrument . The songs may be poignantly plaintive , boisterously celebratory or ironically funny . His fingers pluck the strings with steely precision or waft over them like a passing zephyr . Always there is the pulsing drive of his ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> Perhaps he is most captivating when he roams about the stage as a musical narrator recounting Tom Sawyer 's sly tac tics in luring passing boys into whitewashing Aunt Polly 's fence . <P> A wondrous artist , this Stephen Wade , who spills the heart 's blood of passion and truth in the tradition of Charles Aznavour , Nana Mouskouri , Django Reinhardt and Woody Guthrie . He may have surfaced in Chicago , but his potential fame defies augury.
