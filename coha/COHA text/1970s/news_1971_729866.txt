txt A federal court has ruled the Texas public school financing system unconstitutional , marking another victory for those in favor of seeking to remove public schools from their dependence on local property taxes . The three-judge panel ruled unanimously that the Texas system of school financing , based in part on local property taxes , violates both the federal and state constitutions . The decision was filed with the clerk of courts yesterday just before the government office closed for the weekend . " The state may adopt any financial scheme desired , so long as the variations in wealth among the governmentally chosen districts do not affect the spending for the education of any child , " the judges ruled . Two-Year Limit The judges gave the state two years to restructure its school financing system , and warned that if the legislature fails to act the court " will take such further steps as may be necessary to implement both the purpose and the spirit of this order . " In Washington , Sarah Carey , assistant director of the Lawyers Committee of Civil Rights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country , said the ruling would pave the way for a quick decision by the United States Supreme Court which would set the standard thruout the nation . Unlike Illinois Case The three federal judges in Texas dismissed a state contention that the court should be bound by an earlier U. S , Supreme Court ruling that let stand a similar school financing system in Illinois . In Illinois , the judges said , the plaintiffs asked that the court approve a specific method of eliminating the inequity , while in Texas the suit did not seek a requirement by the courE . The Texas suit was filed July 30 , 1968 , by 15 MexicanAmerican parents and children in the Edgewood Independent School District at San Antonio . The judges ruled it was a class action for children in Edgewood and " all other children thruout Texas who live in districts with low property valuations . " Foes Call It Socialism Assistant Atty .

" This is the most far-reaching federal court decision In recent history , " Lt. Gov . Ben Barnes , a candidate for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination , said . " I feel the state should begin immediately to study all aspects of the decision . " Barnes said , however , that he was concerned that loss of local financing in Texas would mean less of local control over education . The federal ruling in Texas follows a California state Supreme Court decision that was basically the same . Same in Most States Members of the federal panel in San Antonio are Circuit Judge Irving L.

Ruling in Illinois In 1068 , the Federal District Court in Chicago ruled that the state 's financial apportionment system for schools was constitutional because the court said it had no basis to determine the needs of educational districts in the state . The United States Supreme Court in 1969 affirmed the decision . The Texas decision was the third case in the f eder al courts in which a state system of distributing school tax revenue was ruled unconstitutional . On Oct. 14 , , federal Judge Miles M. Lord in Minnesota upheld the plaintiff 's contention in Van DuSartz vs . Hatfield that Minnesota 's system of allocating school funds was unconstitutional . He retained jurisdiction in the case and said he would make a further comment after the state legislature ended its session last month . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
