txt Letters Difficult Task of Setting New York City Rents To the Editor : The news analysis ( June 30 ) of the recent activities of the Rent Guidelines Board presented an inaccurate assessment of the level of attention and concern Mayor Koch and I have devoted to the board , which now sets rents for more than 850,000 rent stabilized apartments . The board 's original mandate , under the rent stabilization law of 1969 , was to set rents for a rent stabilized housing stock of a few hundred thousand apartments , primarily in newer luxury buildings . Now , as a result of changes in the law , more than 450,000 formerly rent-controlled apartments in pre-1947 buildings fall within the board 's jurisdiction . In addition , the recent " sunshine " laws properly require that the board 's formerly private deliberations be held in public ; soon the public meetings will become hearings , where the public may testify as well as observe . Clearly , the Rent Guidelines Board must change in order to be able to deal responsibly with these changed circumstances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the City Council on legislation designed to provide the board with an increased capacity to deal with this new , larger and more complex housing constituency . This legislation , which I announced at a public hearing on May 18 , would provide the board with a permanent , independent and fulltime staff ( heretofore , the board has " borrowed " staff from the Department of Housing Preservation and Development when it was needed , and this staff has done an extremely competent and thorough job ) and would increase the amount of paid time for the board from 10 to 30 days per year for members and from 10 to 45 days for the chairperson . The guidelines board , under the able chairmanship of Frances Levenson , who has just announced her resignation , has made a superhuman effort to set equitable rents during a period of volatile change not only in the nature of the housing stock but also in the costs of operating all types of housing . We know that fuel costs have risen 36.6 percent this year for rent stabilized housing , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to predict that they will go up again . How much ? Even an expert statistician would hesitate to second-guess OPEC . Setting and regulating rents is therefore an extremely difficult and important task these days . This is why we are particularly interested in the forthcoming report of the Temporary State Commission on Rental Housing , which will make recommendations about the future of rent regulations in the city and state , as well as the status of the guidelines board . Mayor Koch has strongly recommended that the current dual system of rent control and rent stabilization be replaced by a single , unified and simplified system . Most important , however , is that any system place equitably on both tenants and owners the burden of increasing costs and the responsibilities of meeting those costs . The determinations of the guidelines board must continue to be thorough and fair , but in no circumstances will they be easy .

If money were no object , I , too , would prefer a Manhattan apartment , . say , something on the southern perimeter of Central Park , three bedrooms , wood-burning fireplace , terrace and , perhaps , a space in the building 's garage . I 'd like to be within walking distance of the Sheep Meadow , Lincoln Center and , for trendy indulgence , Bloomingdale 's . Yet , I and my ex-New York neighbors have grown wary of paying so much for our rent , food and basic services that there is no money for these indulgences . We made a choice . We Children of Aliens To the Editor : Aliens otherwise deportable , and deported , must take their U.S.-born children with them , or leave them here with friends , relatives or institutions . The enforced separation of such aliens from their U.S.-citizen children , or the necessity for such U.S.-born children to depart from their native land under such circumstances , say the courts , does not raise a problem of constitutional dimensions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ International Year of the Child , in this year of our concern for the boat people , to preserve families . These are people whose presence among us challenges us to liberalize our immigration laws . There are those among us who remember the great Fridtjof Nansen , his passport , and his great services not only to the refugees of his day ( 1922 ) , but to the reluctant host countries which simply could not afford to care for and maintain the massive stream of refugees . A parallel between the problems of that day and the problems of today 's boat people suggests itself .

To the Editor : Coupon rationing is again being considered as a solution to the gasoline ( and heating oil ? ) problem . Such rationing worked reasonably well during World  --  War II , but it is uncertain how well it would work in peacetime ? even peacetime morally equivalent to wartime ? and it would do nothing to stimulate supply . Moreover , such rationing would take six months or more to set up and would create a fresh bureaucracy . ' Before deciding that coupon rationing is the solution , Congress and the Administration should consider the main alternative : immediate decontrol of oil and oil product prices . This would stimulate supply and encourage substitution of other energy sources . The objection that still higher prices would impose a hardship on the poor can be alleviated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gasoline ( and heating oil ? ) stamps . Long experience with food stamps should enable similar criteria and the same mechanism to be used in distributing gasoline stamps . HAROLD BARGER Chatham , N.Y. , July 5 , 1979 Downstate Medical 's Role in Brooklyn To the Editor : Your recent editorial , " Special Pleading for Hospitals , " presented an exceedingly complex policy issue . In the process , however , a serious misimpression was conveyed with regard to an important unit of the State University of New York , Downstate Medical Center . Downstate Medical Center is not an ivory tower but the reverse , a vital contributor to the health care needs of the underserved and underprivileged citizens of Brooklyn . Downstate Medical Center has had a long and venerable relationship with its neighboring institution across Clarkson Avenue , Kings County Hospital . With some 1,300 beds , Kings County is the major municipal institution in Brooklyn caring for hundreds of thousands of needy men , women and children . The faculty and staff from Downstate Medical Center thus respond to the health care needs of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are needy and underprivileged . This activity represents an enormous professional contribution to the health and well-being of the people in the county . Moreover , Downstate Medical Center contributes to the public , not only through Kings County Hospital , but also through 13 other hospital centers in Brooklyn which depend upon the talents and strengths of the Downstate medical complex . My colleagues and I of the State University of New York are very proud of Downstate Medical Center for the importance of its work in quality health professions education , pivotal health research and the delivery of highest quality public clinical care to all citizens of Brooklyn . State University of New York will continue to support and strengthen this public service mission . CLIFTON R. WHARTON , JR . Chancellor State .

TEST Oneonta , N.Y. , July 5. 1979 Do Oil Companies Need Higher Profits to Produce More Oil ? ' To the Editor : In a recent paid advertisement and subsequent letters to the editor , Mobil Oil Corporation has attacked me for criticizing its high profits and low taxes . Specifically , the company asserts that I misstated its effective U.S. tax rate , which I indicated was about 16 percent . Mobil insists it pays at a rate of 40 percent or more . Further research has led me to conclude that I did , in fact , err . Mobil 's effective tax rate on U.S. income is not the 16 percent I suggested , but neither is it the 40 percent claimed by the company . In fact , Mobil paid at a rate of 11.1 percent for tax year 1977 , according to a report prepared for Representative , Charles Vanik by the Joint Committee on Taxation and the General Accounting Office . The report @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the Securities and Exchange Commission , shows a net U.S. income for 1977 of $969 million and a tax payment of $107.5 million . That 's just 11.1 percent . The full Vanik report on tax payments by major U.S. corporations appears in the June 22 edition of the Congressional Record . Mobil 's claim of a 40 percent tax rate , presumably counts as a " payment " about $327 million in deferred taxes . These are dollars carried on Mobil 's books but never actually paid to the U.S. Treasury . The deferrals are the result of special tax benefits such as intangible drilling cost deductions and accelerated depreciation . As long as the company continues to grow and invest in depreciable assets , it is unlikely that these deferred taxes ever will be paid . The Vanik report goes on to note that while Mobil paid an effective U.S. tax rate of 11.1 percent in 1977 , its effective tax rate on foreign earnings ? money paid to foreign governments and credited against U.S. taxes was 83.2 percent ! Maybe that explains Mobil 's claim before a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every barrel of oil it produces for OPEC . The rest goes to the OPEC governments in the form of taxes , royalties and profit-sharing . Mobil insists that is needs an OPEC price for new American crude as an incentive to expand production . Strangely , though , we have not heard Mobil volunteer to pay the kind of taxes to the U.S. that it pays to the OPEC nations . The facts are that even under price controls production of crude oil in the United States is a highly profitable business . Record industry profits in the first quarter of this year work out at something like a 20 percent return on equity , well above the average for all other industries . Few knowledgeable observers doubt that those profits will continue to grow , regardless of whether decontrol goes forward . The question , then , is this : Do oil companies really need even higher profit incentives in order to produce more domestic oil , or is the domestic crude oil business already profitable enough ? So far , the industry 's answer to that question has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. Senator from Missouri Washington , June 29 , 1979
