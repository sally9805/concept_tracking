ESTABLISHING SHOT - DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES - DAY FADE IN : Situated on the center divider of the San Bernardino Freeway , CAMERA SHOOTS northward toward the city . Heat and gasoline fumes shimmer in a vaporous plasma ; the freeway is clotted with traffic . In the distance , through an umber shroud of smog , we SEE the spire of City Hall . INT . COURTROOM - DAY The Judge 's bench is flanked on one side by the Stars &amp; Stripes , on the other by the silk and brocade Golden Bear .

Blakelock fixes him with the iron-eyed conviction of a general . &nbsp; BLAKELOCKYour division commander says you 're a man who gets the job done . Silent , Shockley nods .

Shockley nods again ; the dreary nature of the assignment is not lost on him . &nbsp; BLAKELOCKThat 'll be all .

Arid and monotonous , the sandy no-man's-land stretches off toward the horizon , bisected only by the threadlike ribbon of highway that traverses it  --  a slim black line of asphalt uniting nowhere with infinity .

She is momentarily stunned by the blow , Shockley preventing her from any further violence by pinning her arms against the wall . We are afforded our first authentic view of her as she recovers . Though not a woman of classical beauty , she possesses that elusive quality that rivets men 's eyes . In her early thirties , her figure has retained the grace and contours of an adolescent 's ; she projects a self-willed independance as hard as Carrara marble . Her steel-grey eyes fix on Shockley with an innate intelligence that sizes up his entire biography in an instant . &nbsp; MALLYTerrific . My life on the line and they send me an on-the-ropes bum .

CLOSE ON THE DEPUTY Unnerved but trying to bluff it out , he gives Shockley a forced laugh . &nbsp; DEPUTYShe 's sure onto all our tricks , ai n't she ? MALLY As she continues , her voice  --  if anything  --  is even milder and less acerbic than before :  --  49  --  &nbsp; MALLYAs I see it , the only difference between you and me is that after I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm clean as the day I was born . But a cop , especially a Deputy like you  --  when the Sheriff whistles , you squat , and what he does to you rots your mind  --  and no amount of water on earth can make you clean again . FAVORING THE DEPUTY Rigid behind the wheel , he shoots a look at Shockley . &nbsp; DEPUTYYou gon na sit there and take that shit ? &nbsp; SHOCKLEY ( indifferent ) You asked her to talk . MALLY She speaks to the Deputy in the soothing tones of a mother to a child beset by nightmares : &nbsp; MALLYI know you do n't like women like me . We seem a bit aggressive . We frighten you . But that 's only because you 've got filth in your brain and I 'm afraid the only way you 'll ever clean it out is to put a bullet through it .

Cocking the hammer  --  &nbsp; SHOCKLEYYou 've had your chat . Now drive . Bleeding from the cut on his head , chest heaving with fury and humiliation , the Deputy wrenches the car back onto the highway , tromps on the gas . Shockley looks over his shoulder , gives Mally the first affirmative expression we have seen  --  a private grin of congratulation . A moment passes between them , the Deputy 's presence temporarily forgotten . Then : &nbsp; MALLY ( quietly ) Shockley ? &nbsp; SHOCKLEYYeah ? &nbsp; MALLYWhat 's going to happen at the border ? &nbsp; SHOCKLEYWe 're picking up an escort to L.A. &nbsp; MALLYWho ? &nbsp; SHOCKLEYCops .

The same people who would have set you up if you had been set up . Brief silence . Then : &nbsp; SHOCKLEYWhat are you trying to say ? &nbsp; MALLYSomebody 's trying to kill me . And since you 're along , you 're a target too . Okay , so maybe the car that blew up  --  the two men who shot at us  --  maybe that was the mob .  --  But at the house , those were policemen outside . Somehow , they got the wrong message . Maybe it was a legitimate mistake ... maybe not . If it was n't , who would 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Hey , I do n't know , but it was n't my guys .

Bout your own people ?  --  52  --  Shockley turns , stares thoughtfully out the window , Mally 's words echoing in his mind . After a long , contemplative moment : &nbsp; SHOCKLEYHow far to the State line ? &nbsp; DEPUTY ( grudgingly ) Nother five mile . &nbsp; MALLYShockley ... ? He turns .

HOLD on the darkness a very long while , then  --  CUT TO : INT . A CAVERN - SHOCKLEY &amp; MALLY - NIGHT They occupy a cramped cave-like shelter beneath a toppled boulder . At their feet a meager fire flickers . At the mouth of the cave , Shockley is a hunched and sullen figure blocking the stars  --  withdrawn , despondent . Mally remains silent for a while , then moves to his side . Sensing the ravages of betrayal that plague him , an innate compassion surfaces . She reaches out , gently touches his shoulder . &nbsp; MALLY ( hesitantly ) If it 's any consolation ... &nbsp; SHOCKLEY ( a snarl ) What ? Her hand snaps back as if burned . &nbsp; MALLYNothing.  --  59  --  &nbsp; SHOCKLEYThen shut up . He returns to his funk .

Her body tenses , her eyes fixed on his . &nbsp; MALLYI do n't want your money , Shockley . I love you for your mind . WHAP !  --  he slaps her . She barely reacts before WHUMP !  --  her knee drives up fiercely into his crotch . Eyes wide with surprise , mouth slack with unspeakable agony , he doubles over clutching his groin . Pivoting away , he slumps against the wall of the cave as she blithely lights a cigarette , casually exhales a mouthful of smoke . &nbsp; MALLYSorry . I just wanted to jog your thinking . He sputters and gags an inarticulate stream of invective . &nbsp; MALLY ( tersely ) You 're a loser , Shockley . I 'm splitting . She sweeps disdainfully past him , starting toward the pitchy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Shockley pulls the Magnum from his belt . Its mechanism clicks harshly in the silence as he cocks it , aims it at her retreating form . Hearing it , she stops in her tracks .  --  60  --  &nbsp; MALLYAre you going to shoot an unarmed woman in the back ? How 'll that look on your stinking record ? Slowly he straightens , only now regaining his breath . &nbsp; SHOCKLEYYou do n't have a chance in the desert . &nbsp; MALLYWith a lox-for-brains like you , I do n't have a chance . On my own , I do okay . &nbsp; SHOCKLEYYeah ? Who saved you from that Deputy ? &nbsp; MALLYDo n't take any bows .

At least that way , when the bullets hit you , you 'll know where the hell they 're coming from ! She stalks away toward the darkness . Shockley stares after her , unmoving , her words ringing in his ears . Slowly he lowers the pistol , slumps down onto the ground , stares dispassionately at the fire .  --  61  --  &nbsp; SHOCKLEY ( absently ) Watch out for sidewinders . Long silence .

He glances at her . &nbsp; SHOCKLEYI guess if you were still in Vegas , you 'd just be going to work about now , huh ? &nbsp; MALLYPolish your badge , Shockley . It 's all you 've got .

A beat . &nbsp; MALLYI 'm a counter-puncher , Shockley . If you ca n't last the twelve rounds , stay out of the ring . About to voice a retort , Shockley falls silent . She will never let him have the last word . He slowly closes the wallet , hiding the badge . The CAMERA MOVES IN . He stares into the fire . Alone with his thoughts . With events .

Will you lay off ? &nbsp; SHOCKLEYThe one time that you met him  --  what happened ? &nbsp; MALLYI do n't want to talk about it . &nbsp; SHOCKLEY ( exasperated ) For all I know , half the goddam L.A. police force is crooked , and you do n't want to talk about it. &nbsp; MALLYYou heard what I said . &nbsp; SHOCKLEYWho are you protecting ? &nbsp; MALLYNobody ! &nbsp; SHOCKLEYBullshit ! &nbsp; MALLYMe .

You 're the only proof  --  and both sides know it . ( a beat - the word sticks in his throat ) ... Please ... She turns to him . There is a hunted , almost supplicative vulnerability in his eyes . It is not lost on her . A heavy silence descends between them . Ultimately : &nbsp; MALLY ( quietly ) DeLucca set me up with somebody . Asked me to be special nice to him . &nbsp; SHOCKLEYWho was it ? &nbsp; MALLYSomeone on the force @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subdued by the memory . &nbsp; SHOCKLEYWhat was his name ? &nbsp; MALLYI did n't ask . &nbsp; SHOCKLEYWhat happened ?

The SOUND of their motorcycles heralds the morning with deep-throated rpm 's As Shockley reacts to the funky tapestry before his eyes , Mally clambers upward to his side , stares O.S. with a mixture of horror and astonishment . &nbsp; MALLYMy God ... &nbsp; SHOCKLEYStay down .

You double up with him . &nbsp; BIKER #5This is my chopper , Charley . Shockley 's Magnum finds the soft spot in the biker 's armpit . &nbsp; SHOCKLEYAnd this is my .38 Special .

The NOISE is overwhelming , RISING to a crescendo as the full force of the nomads gather , bunching like huge metal swallows before spreading out in a ragged file and churning away ... through the canyon 's entrance ... and off across the desert . Left behind is the single bike that Shockley had commandeered ... Shockley himself ... and Mally  --  visible as she emerges from cover and descends the ragged boulder-strewn slope to join him . Shockley watches the departing bikers  --  SEEN as a moving trail of dust  --  then lets out a pent-up breath , holds out a hand and studies it . It trembles.  --  73  --  Turning , he heads for the motorcycle even as Mally reaches level ground and intercepts him . &nbsp; MALLYDigusting ! Ridiculous ! Outrageous ! Shockley , you 're totally outrageous ! &nbsp; SHOCKLEY ( wearily ) Thanks . For all that she is frowning , she is plainly enthralled by his coup .

Hi , it 's me . Shockley half-turns from the window , frowns . Her motives in placing the call are as perplexing to him as her attitude of cheerfulness . She meets his eyes , a steely determination to her gaze  --  indeed a challenge  --  that contrasts markedly with her obvious pleasure at hearing her mother 's voice . &nbsp; MALLY ... I 'm fine . How are you ? ( a pause ) Good . And Daddy ? ( a pause - then ) Jeeeesus , Mom , he 's been complaining about that for years . He ought to see a specialist  --  not that quack he 's been going to .

Her voice  --  in truth her entire persona  --  conveys an optimism , an affirmative ingenuousness far removed from Shockley 's dulled and silent gloom . &nbsp; MALLY ... Anyway , the big news is , I met this man . He 's terrific . I mean what can I tell you ? I mean you 'd love him , Mom . Her eyes hold unflinchingly on Shockley 's . He stares at her , incredulous , as she continues :  --  98  --  &nbsp; MALLY ( a beat ) Shockley . Ben Shockley . Shockley does n't move . He just stares . &nbsp; MALLY ( into phone ) ...

Her eyes remain riveted to Shockley 's ; there is neither guilt nor uncertainty in them . After a moment , she dials the desk . &nbsp; MALLY ( into phone ) Get me 283-8779 in Las Vegas , please . &nbsp; SHOCKLEY ( numbly ) ... maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , her attention on the phone call .

I want five thousand dollars ' worth . Got it ?  --  Yeah . You know I 'm good for it . Okay ?  --  Yes ... on the nose . She 's going to be a winner . She hangs up , crosses to the table , removes the roses from the vase beneath Shockley 's non-plussed gaze . Shaking the moisture from the flower-stems , she lovingly replaces the roses in their box , tucks it under an arm . Only now does she turn to Shockley . &nbsp; MALLYLet 's go .

SEVERAL CUTS SHOCKLEY 'S HANDS as they wrench the big steering wheel . HIS FOOT as it descends on the gas . THE GEAR SHIFT as it is shoved into low . LOW ANGLE The engine ROARS , the tires mightily revolve ... and the bus pulls away from the curb . ON THE ROOFTOP The marksmen pivot with the bus 's trajectory , squeezing off additional SHOTS .  --  120  --  AT THE BUS - CLOSE SHOT - PANNING One or two of the rounds puncture the driver 's side window ... others ricocheting off metal . INSIDE THE BUS The slugs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the engine SURGES . FULL SHOT - THE STREET as the bus pulls off and away in a cloud of diesel exhaust ... abandoning the scene of the ambush ... ... and Josie 's lifeless body on the off-ramp in a pool of blood . AWAY TO : INSIDE THE BUS - ON SHOCKLEY Driving , his knuckles white on the wheel . &nbsp; SHOCKLEYThey killed him . The sons of bitches killed him . Feyderspiel . It was Feyderspiel . Him and Blakelock . He turns to Mally huddled beside him , beside the steel plating of his turret . &nbsp; SHOCKLEYHang on . We 're going in . HIGH ANGLE - INTERSECTION As the bus makes the turn and ploughs down the street perpendicular to the ambush . The street is deserted , devoid of human life . A wasteland . AWAY TO :  --  121  --  ANOTHER STREET Similarly empty of all traffic . Desolate . Silent ... ... save for the rustle of a sandwich wrapper as the city winds impel it down the asphalt ... ... and now , dimly audible , the SOUND of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the street is not deserted . An officer has taken cover in a doorway on the north side of the street , pistol in his hand . A second officer lurks in the adjacent doorway , holding a rifle . And now , as CAMERA PANS , we SEE that every doorway  --  every conceivable place of concealment along the north side of the street  --  is occupied by a policeman ... armed and ready . The SOUND of the bus is growing louder . CLOSE SHOT - A COP He checks the loads in his shotgun . SOUND of the bus 's engine RISING ... CLOSE SHOT - ANOTHER COP Nervous , he shifts his weight , wipes dampness from his face . SOUND of the bus 's engine RISING ... CLOSE SHOT - THIRD COP Idly studying his revolver with something akin to remorse . SOUND of the bus 's engine ROARS , and  --  LONG SHOT It THUNDERS into view around a corner at the distant end of the block . VARIOUS CUTS - POLICEMEN Readying their weapons .  --  122  --  MED . SHOT - COMMANDING OFFICER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ON SHOCKLEY He shouts above the DIN of the engine : &nbsp; SHOCKLEYHit the deck ! ON MALLY - BRIEF CUT Flattening herself against the floor of the bus . ON SHOCKLEY He downshifts savagely . ON HIS FOOT as he floors the accelerator . Inescapable is our VIEW of his lower leg  --  the bloody hole in his trousers above the calf  --  the trickle of blood that dampens the pedal , staining it crimson . ON THE BUS - LOW ANGLE It THUNDERS down the street toward LENS . BRIEF CUT - COMMANDER Eyes fixed on the enemy ... bullhorn at his lips . BRIEF CUT - THE BUS Its horn BLARES a drawn-out brazen challenge ! BRIEF CUT - COMMANDER &nbsp; COMMANDER ( into bullhorn ) Open fire !  --  123  --  ON THE BUS - PANNING As it reaches the initial stretch of the quantlet and the men open fire . THE GAUNTLET - MONTAGE - SLOW MOTION A Scenicruiser is not exactly a kiddie-car . It is eighteen feet tall , eight feet wide , forty feet long and weighs twenty-six thousand pounds . It has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shatterproof glass windows , and it is made to stand up indefinitely under half a million miles ' service . It has a mammoth diesel engine housed behind heavy alloy siding in the rear of the vehicle . A Scenicruiser simply does not break down . It might as well be a tank . Traveling at sixty miles an hour , weighing thirteen tons , the equation for sheer mass is staggering . It traverses a half mile in roughly thirty seconds , and as it roars past the blazing guns we see it absorb on the order of four hundred gunshots . To be sure , most of these would harmlessly pierce its windows and its chrome alloy luggage bays . Many would ricochet off Shockley 's sheet metal turret . Few would pierce the engine compartment , since the best angle at the engine compartment is from the rear , and to shoot at the rear of the bus would oblige the police to shoot at a tangent perilously close to their own forces  --  and this they have been told not to do . Most modern police carry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .38 can not be relied upon to stop an angry drunk in his tracks . It has been rumored that a slug from a Magnum will pierce the engine block of an automobile but only if it is a steel jacketed slug . Police , who commonly shoot at men instead of cars , prefer the hollowpoint  --  a lead , non-jacketed slug of questionable legality but guaranteed killing ability , since it spreads out upon impact with human viscera . But a hollowpoint is simply not very effective against metal . And as for riot-guns loaded with shot , well ... these weapons were never intended for us against Scenicruisers . And so it is that the bus  --  in that eternal heartbeat of its plunge through the first stretch of the gauntlet does not stop ... and it has traversed no more than half the length of the block when the police SEE that it 's not going to stop , fire away though they might . And their awe is wonderful to behold .  --  124  --  Such is the scheme of things outside the bus . Inside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ type of fusillade we describe , the experience would seem interminable ; the noise alone would numb the senses . And so it is  --  INSIDE THE BUS - WITH SHOCKLEY &amp; MALLY He who has not inhabited a foxhole under fire can hardly imagine the primal truths to which mortal flesh is heir . It is not uncommon for strong men to void both bladder and bowels  --  and often it is not mere refuse which the body abandons , but reason itself . Warfare has a way of snapping that divine link between sanity and soma , reducing  --  sometimes permanently  --  its victims to that raw and naked psychosis euphemistically known as shell shock. A technical term for the cause of that psychosis is sensory overload , and what it means is that the system is simply subjected to more sense input than it can tolerate . We become animals , in the most basic biological meaning of the word . Thus it is with Shockley and Mally , particularly with the girl , who is not protected , as he is , by a fortification of cold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no escape . The noise alone is alien to human life . In addition to the O.S. CRACKING of pistols and BOOMING of shotguns , our ears are deafened by the steam-drill RAT TAT TAT of bullets as they hit the Scenicruiser 's metal sides , the stacatto SHATTERING of glass as slugs rip through the safety-windows in whirring multitudes , the incessant WHINE of their ricochet off metal surfaces of the bus 's interior . Added to this grotesque cacophony is the unremitting ROAR of the engine as Shockley feeds gas , goes through the gears . Withal , it is a symphony from Hell , above which Mally 's YELL is little more than the piercing obbligato of a secondary woodwind . Clapping her hands to her ears , features distorted by the sheer VOLUME OF NOISE , her body twists as if to press itself into the very substance of the rocking , vibrating floor  --  attempting the impossible in an organic plea for surcease ; when this fails , her limbs involuntarily contract , drawing her supple , vulnerable form into that compact and universal posture from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ born . And with the final betrayal  --  when even that proves futile , when to the horrendous and incessant THUNDER that surrounds her is added the utter and inescapable panic of imminent extinction  --  an innate and quintessential terror  --  when repeated YELLS are throttled  --  125  --  by excessive helplessness , reduced into choking , gasping sobs  --  her system cries out in silent agony , her body quivers , trembles like that of an infant rabbit in traumatic shock , begging in some primeval way for the coup de grace that will once and foreve terminate all suffering . THE BUS SEEN as it nears the end of the block and the barriers erected there , a shattered parody of what it was . Though its engine BELLOWS , the gunfire is slackening . ANGLE - A COP lowering his weapon with a trace of surprise that the thing is still moving . VARIOUS CUTS - OTHER COPS as they watch it retreat around the corner  --  bemused . COMMANDING OFFICER - BRIEF CUT He raises a two-way , speaking into it : &nbsp; COMMANDING OFFICERWe failed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BACK TO SCENE - BRIEF CUT as the bus thunders forward , nearing the corner .

And the faces of the cops as they shoot  --  teeth clenched magnums bucking in their hands  --  rifles kicking into shoulders  --  firing round after round  --  and one of them , a rookie , unaccountable weeping . INSIDE THE BUS - ON SHOCKLEY as a wild ricochet splatters against the interior of his turret . His face jerks as if with a charge of high voltage : red specks of blood popping out on his cheek and neck . &nbsp; SHOCKLEYShit  --  ! ! ! &nbsp; MALLY O.S.

There 's a barrier ! &nbsp; SHOCKLEYScrew the barrier ! The bus lurches forward with such ferocity that Shockley all but slides down the length of the aisle . EXT .

VARIOUS CUTS - POLICE They direct a brutal stream of gunfire directly at the front of the onrushing bus . QUICK CUT - INSIDE BLAKELOCK 'S OFFICE - BLAKELOCK He stares out the window in catatonic disbelief as the final fusillade erupts from the base of the building , directly below . His face is fucking white . Whirling , he rushes out . OUTSIDE CITY HALL - THE BUS A roaring wreck , a dying juggernaut , it ploughs into the hellish curtain of gunfire .

THE BUS Its fusellage peppered with buckshot , cratered with bullet-holes , it rumbles forward on its rims ... steam pouring from a multitude of apertures as momentum decreases ... its windows long-since gone , the SOUNDS of its decelleration a grotesque assortment of mechanical complaint . Only now ... finally ... literally shot to death ... with one last terminal rattle of its engine it grinds to a total stop directly at the base of the wide marble stairs . ON THE COPS They cease firing , guns poised and silent in their hands . Suspiciously , they survey the lifeless metal hulk . No sound emanates from within . A total and unearthly silence settles on those gathered . HOLD .  --  131  --  Now CAMERA PANS AWAY to the route from whence the bus had come .

FULL SHOT - THE DOOR Something moves within the bus . CLOSE SHOT LENS TIGHT on the three interior steps immediately inside the bus 's door as Shockley 's foot takes the first downward stride , INTO VIEW . We SEE the makeshift tourniquet , the trouser-leg dark and sopping with blood ... the bloodied shoe ... OUTSIDE THE BUS - A COP Magnum in both hands , he levers back the hammer . It CLICKS resoundingly in the silence .  --  132  --  AT THE BUS as Shockley 's full figure comes INTO VIEW in the bus 's doorway : a gruesome , debilitated spectre of a man . His face is half-covered with blood from small wounds  --  the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the front of his shirt . His face is a ghastly , sunken-eyed white  --  the result of sheer physical trauma . It defies imagination that a human being could absorb such punishment , and survive . Pausing briefly  --  pistol tucked into his waist  --  he half-falls as he steps from the bus and onto the pavement : a living apparition . In his hand he clutches a ragged , blood-soaked paper : the subpoena for one Gus Mally . ON THE COPS The limits to which the man has suffered are not lost on them . Subliminal is the knowledge that he is , after all , one of their own . ON SHOCKLEY No more than ten feet from the nearest of the cops , he releases his hand-hold on the bus 's door ... sways on his feet ... turns stiffly back to the door and gallantly extends a hand . Augustina Mally moves unsteadily INTO VIEW at the top of the steps .

ON THE COPS Their guns tracking with the retreating couple . HOLD again on the veteran seen earlier . We SENSE the inner debate taking place . And then , in a gesture that bespeaks the general mind , one of the Battalion Captains simply reaches out and with a finger lowers the Veteran 's gun-barrel toward the ground .

Killed at once , he slumps in Shockley 's arms , exposing Shockley to Blakelock 's final shot  --  and Shockley takes it high in the chest . He and Feyderspiel topple to the stairs . With a scream , Mally throws herself atop Shockley 's prostrate form , shielding his body with her own as she takes the magnum from his unmoving hand . ON BLAKELOCK Face twisted with psychotic rage , he trains his pistol on the girl and fires .

His legs weak and rubbery , he back-pedals , veers , staggers downward , sideways ... the look of a rabid animal fixed on his dying face . All the while , the pistol rises in his hand , gripped by a determination which has not yet been extinguished . Aiming it with unerring accuracy at Mally 's figure , he pulls the trigger .  --  137  --  And in a single , sly , sublime punctuation to all that such men stand for , to all that this man represents : the ultimate impotence of essence as well as attitude ( and the fitting and proper parenthesis to a long-ago encounter with Mally herself )  --   --  the hammer falls on an empty chamber .
