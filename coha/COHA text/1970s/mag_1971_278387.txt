THE last time the dollar was devalued - by a stroke of Franklin D. Roosevelt 's pen in 1934* - Budget Director Lewis Douglas declared : " This is the end of Western civilization . " It was a sign of the economic times last week that , when Richard Nixon announced another dollar devaluation , the predominant reaction throughout Western civilization was one of relief . Richard Kattel , president of The Citizens &; Southern Bank of Georgia , expressed the new American mood : " I think devaluation is a good thing . It will make us more competitive overseas . We have swallowed the hardest pill we had to swallow - our pride . " <P> That assessment represents a rare victory of reality over mythology . For decades , American statesmen and financiers have viewed devaluation as an unthinkable national humiliation and a devastating blow to the non-Communist world 's financial system , which uses the dollar as the central trading currency . In fact , the dollar has long been overvalued , partly for reasons that reflect credit rather than blame on the U.S. American aid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mighty industrial power in Japan . Those actions reduced the U.S. 's dominance of world business , which the dollar 's price had reflected in the early postwar years . U.S. private investment and tourism also pumped money into foreign economies , and American military spending overseas protected Allied countries-at the cost of spilling out an oversupply of dollars . <P> Benign Neglect . At home , possession of an overvalued dollar encouraged the illusion of American supremacy . But the U.S. paid a high price for that illusion in loss of markets to its overseas competitors , because American goods became artificially expensive in relation to foreign products . The world paid a high price too : the outflow of overvalued dollars to foreign countries helped spread inflation around the globe and robbed world finance of stability . <P> Less than a year ago , U.S. international financial policy was ruled by the idea of " benign neglect " : the complacent conviction that Americans could continue pouring out their overvalued dollars , buying as many foreign goods and factories as they chose and spending on military ventures as lavishly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so the theory went , had to absorb all the dollars because the dollar was as good as gold . It had an " immutable " value in terms of gold , and the U.S. was pledged to sell American gold-at the rate of $35 an ounce-in exchange for dollars that foreigners wished to cash in . But as foreigners piled up almost $50 billion in U.S. currency , while the U.S. gold stock melted to $10 billion , that pledge became hollow . Nixon gave it the coup de grce on Aug. 15 by decreeing that the U.S. would no longer redeem foreign-held dollars for gold .
