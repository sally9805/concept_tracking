The Rev , Phil Archbald of the First Church of the Brethren in Brooklyn jumped up on a table and prayed that the " Lord will intercede in this room . " He ended his prayer by giving the closed door a loud whack with his hand . The vote ended Dr. Hollormm 's threeyear tenure as the city 's highest-paid official , at $65,000 a year , and head of a sprawling hospital system that still employs 37,000 workers despite 8,000 job cuts over the last year and a half . Appointed in 1973 , Mr. Holloman succeeded Dr. Joseph T. English , who was the corporation 's first president after it was created by the Lindsay administration in 1970 and who resigned a day before the board had scheduled a vote on a motion of no confidence in his tenure .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
