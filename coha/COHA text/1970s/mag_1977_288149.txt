Movie crews pour cash into Midwest <P> From Hollywood , a boom town with a village psychology , film producers have long been roaming the world searching for unusual locations that will jolt the jaded eyes of moviegoers . Having dispatched camera crews from Abidjan to Zempoaltepec , movie moguls are now discovering an inviting area closer to home : the U.S. Midwest . In the view of film executives , America 's heartland is " virgin territory " on the screen , unknown even to many Americans-not to mention foreign movie buffs . It also offers the stark authenticity that many current movies demand : steel mills , gritty factory towns , ghettos black and ethnic , as well as the lush estates of the better-heeled . <P> So Huron Productions chose Dubuque , Iowa , to film some scenes for F.I.S.T . ( the Federation of Interstate Truckers ) , which is being distributed by United Artists . It stars Sylvester Stallone ( Rocky ) playing a warehouse worker who becomes one of the country 's most powerful labor leaders . Dubuque has the ambience of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Betsy , about infighting in the auto industry , is , naturally , being shot in Detroit . Much footage for EMI Limited 's The Deer Hunter , a blue-collar special starring Robert De Niro , was shot in a bowling alley in Struthers , Ohio , and a U.S. Steel plant in Cleveland . Bette Davis is starring in Harvest Home , a Universal Production for NBC being shot in Conneaut , Ohio . <P> The Midwest is showing its usual hospitality , as much for pecuniary reasons as politeness : a pot of money comes to town when a big-budget movie crew arrives . It is not uncommon for the movie company and crew to spend more than $1 million on lodging , food , props , local extras and other labor . That sum generates nearly four times as much spending power as it percolates through the local economy-and the hosts incur few offsetting expenses . Says Ray Gosnell , vice president for production management at 20th Century-Fox : " There is no need to build roads or schools for us as the case would be if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ substantial amount of money in a short period of time ; then we are out of the way . " <P> Midwestern state governments are wooing movie companies the way underdeveloped countries lay bait for multinational corporations . Illinois , Ohio and Kentucky have set up state film boards . They promote the advantages of movie production in their states through campaigns in Variety and the Hollywood Reporter , send emissaries to the studio heads , scout locations , ensure the cooperation of local police forces and other state agencies and act as general factotums when the glamorous people come to town .
