txt A broad investigation of faults in the testing of new drugs on animals is leading to criminal charges against some research laboratories and will have " ripple effects around the world , " according to Dr. Alexander M. Schmidt , Commissioner of Food and Drugs . Most of the faults discovered so far by the drug agency seem to reflect sloppy research , he said , but there has also been evidence of fraud . Studies of animals are a key part of the process by which new drugs are approved for human use . If the data supplied by the drug companies are unreliable , Dr. Schmidt has said , it is a matter that strikes at the heart of the whole process by which drugs are approved . Dr. Schmidt is retiring from the drug agency on Dec. 1 to return to the University of Illinois Medical Center in Chicago as vice chancellor for health services . A Problem Pursued for Years In an Interview here , he said that the problem of data reliability on the testing of animals was a subject of extreme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years . More than a year ago , drug agency investigators accused G. D. Searle &; Company , one of the 10 largest drug concerns in America , of providing the Government with false information concerning animal tests of two widely used drugs . These were Flagyl , for treatment of a vaginal infection , and Aldactone , which is used to lower blood pressure . Several months ago the drug agency recommended to the Justice Department a grand jury investigation of the evidence . The investigation is continuing , but the material has not yet been presented to a grand jury , an agency spokesman said today . In the interview earlier , Dr. Schmidt said that the drug agency had made investigations , so far , of about a half dozen laboratories that study animals for the drug industry . From these half dozen investigations , he said , will come several governmental actions including grand jury investigations and prosecutions . The agency has completed making recommendations to the Justice Department in one case , Dr. Schmidt said , and two others will be completed within weeks . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Phase The commissioner said , however , that the first handful of investigations involved only the opening phase of a much more ambitious effort that would survey the animal-test performance of fully a tenth of all the laboratories that test new drugs on animals . The investigation will cover about 40 laboratories in the next three to four months . The laboratories to be surveyed will include some operated by universities as well as those of drug companies and commercial contract concerns . From this survey , Dr. Schmidt said , the agency should get a clear idea of the size and scope of the problem of the reliability of data from animal testing throughout the United States . He said that other agencies such as the National Cancer Institute , the Environmental Protection Agency and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration all had had problems about doubtful test results brought to their attention but had not done any investigations approaching in size and scope those of the F.D.A. With the help of Congressional leaders , notably Senators Edward M. Kennedy , Democrat of Massachusetts , and Jacob K. Javits , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given about $16 million and 600 persons to do the investigation . Dr. Schmidt said the work to be done by this augmented investigatory force would be extremely important to many other regulatory agencies in addition to his own and that the effects would be felt abroad as well as in this country . " It is a program of major importance that will have ripple effects around the world without any question at all , " he said . When he leaves the agency , Dr. Schmidt will have served as commissioner for more than three and a half years , far longer than his last several predecessors . He said many changes had taken place in his tenure and that the agency was today better and stronger than it had ever been . He also said the products the agency regulated were better than ever before and that major reviews had been going on for the last several years of prescription drugs , over-the-counter drugs and food additives . Chronic Shortage of Specialists Dr. Schmidt said the drug agency had been criticized much more for the length of time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had done . The reason for the slowness , he said , is that the agency has a chronic shortage of highly trained specialists in all the fields it must cover . The Food and Drug Administration has a staff of just under 7,000 persons and an annual budget of about $245 million . This comes out , Dr. Schmidt noted , to slightly more than $1 a year for each American . He said the agency could well be twice its present size and that , if not expanded , there would have to be some public discussion of what tasks it could ' not be expected to do . Upon leaving the agency , some of his predecessors have charged that their work had been hampered by constant heavy pressure from the drug industry . In the two-hour interview that covered a broad range of subjects , Dr. Schmidt said there had been industry pressure in his tenure but that the greatest pressure had come from Congress , the consumer movement and the news media . Industry can not do anything to the agency , he said , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been useful , others have not , he said , but altogether the drain on his time has been severe , he added .
