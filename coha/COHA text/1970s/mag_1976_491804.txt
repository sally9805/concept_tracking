SAN DIEGO BAY Navies have waded through it , yachtsmen have played on it , civilization has drawn circles around it , yet it is still one of the cleanest harbors in the world . By John Bayliss Oceans have become synonymous with oil spills and extensions of the city dump . Fortunately , San Diego cherishes its water , and the water cherishes San Diego . The harbor is one of the cleanest in the world . For decades , navies have waded through it ( 137 naval it ; yet the waters remain clear , pliant , dressed to be attractive . As so often happens in California , history is just around the corner  --  in this case at Point Loma , a promontory to the harbor entrance . The statue of Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo high on the bluff looks down on the specks of life below . This Portuguese navigator entered the bay late in 1542 , planted the Spanish flag , called the place San Miguel , hopped on board again and continued his search for the Northwest Passage , a suitable destination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain pique in Cabrillo 's face it 's because in 1602 , when Spain sent an expedition to inspect the property , the commander , on a name-changing spree , rechristened the spot San Diego . A modern Visitor Center adjoins the monument site and has exhibits of Cabrillo 's historic voyage . All around are park benches , tucked amid flowering bougainvillea and hibiscus : a grand way to enjoy an overview of the city and the harbor . An added attraction nearby is the Old Point Loma Lighthouse , built in 1854 , with rooms redecorated in the manner of 1887 . The old lady was a bit contrary , for when the fogs rolled in her beams successfully shone out only over the fog bank . An invisible beam enjoying itself at an altitude of 488 feet was of little use to shipping so the lady was politely retired after thirty-seven years and a new lighthouse built at the base of the promontory at Ballast Point . Just below the old lighthouse is the whale overlook . From December through February , thousands of thirty-five- to fifty-foot gray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quiet lagoons of Baja California , skirting the kelp beds at the base of Point Loma . Telltale ten- to fifteen-foot spouts show where the huge mammals are cavorting on their way to a warm vacation spot to raise a family . An even more exciting way to pander to the Captain Ahab in all of us is to join an excursion boat ride out of Shelter Island or Mission Bay . It was a cool , misty morning when a group of us were welcomed aboard a luxurious Qualifier 105 by her skipper , Bruce Barnes , a twenty-six-year veteran of sportsfishing cruises . poises ( Sadie and Martha ) used in experiments in recovering objects from the deep were frolicking in their pens . The light was fading . A giant sea lion was silhouetted at the end of the pier  --  playing merrily in an empty bathtub . Pleasantly surprising is not only the equilibrium of San Diego 's sunny climate but also the proximity of everything . A few minutes ' drive gets you to any destination . Consequently , the liveliness of the city begins at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Undersea Center . A- narrow strip of landfill , this island is a wonder of muted colored lights of an evening  --  a mandarin 's summer palace . Imagine a Fifth Avenue of yachts riding quietly at anchor as owners move the action to the fashionable Kona Kai Club  --  is that Jerry Lewis , Charlton Heston , at the bar ? ? to the Voyager discotheque or to any number of fine hotels and eating places . Life is casual , especially at the giant Polynesian but of the Bali Ha'i restaurant , where diners are entertained with wild fire dances of the South Seas or the ancient love rituals of Samoa . I myself was in the mood for chicken ? " Chicken of the Gods " on the menu . My drink was " Missionary 's Downfall . " During the day , yachtsmen puff their spinnaker plumage , make sails flutter like Brazilian moths around a tiny land mass . ( There are more than 3,500 pleasure craft in the harbor . ) A whole supporting industry tacks along the shoreline : sign painters , woodcarvers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On a Kleenex tissue of dock space , Driscoll 's Custom Boatyard builds challengers for the America Cup . From the street you see only a medium-sized wall of galvanized sheeting . But behind it was built the likes of Intrepid . The day I called by , Gerry Driscoll was overseeing construction of the next contender for the Cup . A deep aluminum-welded hull was tattooed like the body of Moby Dick 's Queequeg , signs for minuscule humps in the surface . I was shown the central location where 16,000 pounds of lead would be placed as ballast . " Gold would do the job better , " remarked Driscoll . In the loft was stored lightweight spruce for the superstructure , cedar battens , teak for the galley , and incense cedar for the bottom of the drawers . Custom-made indeed . Bob and Sandra Driscoll  --  no relation to the yacht builder  --  are typical of the folk you meet by the water . I stopped by their thirty-six-foot Angelman Ketch for a chat one afternoon , while the children in scuba gear were busy cleaning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home and had invested all in the boat , ready for the day when they would sail around the world . Bob is a laser physicist but away from work he lives the simple life of oil lamps and the swell of the ocean . Each year the family ventures far ther on their voyages , down to Mexico , up to San Francisco . Not that everything is smooth sailing . Sandra recalls the storm they encountered three years ago when they hove to for days and got carried 100 miles out to sea . The boys now clamber aboard to add their reminiscences , such as when they watched the babies of a sea lion colony off the Santa Barbara coast . The Driscoll craft is indistinguishable from the hundreds moored nearby but the dreams that emanate from it are of the Marquesas , the Galapagos , Pitcairn , Easter and Turk Islands . The bay now angles toward the downtown , past Harbor Island . Like an atoll in the Pacific , this small strip of land , less than a mile in length , suddenly appeared in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Forrestal class to enter the bay . It offered the city the spoil , three and one-half million tons of it . In accordance with a master plan , the Port Authority leased out the landfill in 1970 to allow a pleasant miniature Palm Beach to spring up . Harbor Island is now at the center of San Diego 's convention trade , with 1,060 hotel rooms , nine restaurants , nine cocktail lounges , six live entertainment rooms , coffee shops , marinas , yacht brokers , and boutiques : a $40 million investment . Two luxurious Sheraton hotels cater to the needs of 2,000 conventioners , while a smaller TraveLodge provides services for another 250 . The airport , a few minutes ' drive away , remains unobtrusive . At the eastern end of the palm-lined boulevard is the Reuben E. Lee . A reminder of the St. Louis waterfront , or more particularly of those wonderful floating seafood meccas in Australia 's Sydney Harbor , this restaurant is a replica of a Mississippi sternwheeler . Besides fish , the offerings include roast duckling , steak Oscar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lavish brunch , San Diego 's Sunday instituLion . Other dining places range from the Mexican El Torito to Love 's Wood Pit Barbecue . At the other end of the island , the late Tom Ham , a colorful entrepreneur , founded his dream Lighthouse Restaurant . He was told he had to preserve the Coast Guard navigational light , so he built his establishment around it ; a multimillion-dollar creation , two-thirds of which juts out over the water . The Lighthouse is more than a restaurant , it 's a museum . One dines beneath the art of the shipcarver : giant figureheads and stern plates . On your way to hear the Ramsey Lewis Trio in the T'ween Decks Lounge you duck beneath a mighty eagle , or pass between two ship 's wheels down the gangway to the California Room . Among the artifacts on display are several billet heads ( fiddleheads to the sailors ) , carvings which once graced the bowsprits of old square-riggers . In such surroundings it is easy to imagine the waters outside crammed with sails , masts and rigging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ located squashed pumpkin of land where naval jets are constantly on the move . But perhaps nostalgically you see it some years back , with thousands of jackrabbits  --  and Old Cap'n Waters , keeper of the marine ways there . As the harbor history book , They Came by Sea , tells it , the island used to be a voting precinct in which Waters was both election board and sole voter . " ... each year the local press would solemnly announce that ' North Island Goes 100% Republican . ' But that was not Old Cap'n Waters ' only distinction : If a ship was being hauled out and some idiot set a bilge block improperly , or a steamer passed by and caused a swell which threatened to topple her over , he would display a grasp of the most robust part of the English language which could boil the pitch out of deck seams . " I talked with Bill Burnes , who manages the boats at Harbor Island 's Marina Cortez . Originally a Cape Codder and retired from the navy since 1961 , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Van Dyke to sail in that one . Of course , he 's graduated to a Ranger 33 since . " In three two-hour lessons Burnes feels sure he can teach anybody to handle a twenty-one-footer . The cost : around $80 . He talks about his charger clientele : " They 're mostly in their late thirties or early forties and come from Phoenix , Tucson , L.A. People like to make the three- or four-hour sailing trip to Mission Bay or to the Coronado Islands . Quite a few Canadians anchor here since it 's the last U.S. port before Mexico . " I asked him about a small galleon I noticed in one of the slips : " Oh , that gives the owner a lot of fun ; it took him seven years to build . " The usual dockside is marked , continued from page 15 a bite at the Colonel Sanders stand ; we went wandering among the cactus plants , where we scavenged for Polaroid packs , Dr. Pepper cans , and other colorful artifacts of savage man ; and then my daughters took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll get a nice tax deduction from owning a condominium , " he said to me . " We were thinking of putting one up , but all our capital right now is tied up in manufacturing old relics for tourists . " We talked for a while and then the girls and I returned to the apartment , where three Japanese gentlemen had just opened the door . " Can I help you ? " I said to one . " Oh , that would be lovely , " he said . " Some tea and cakes and perhaps a few hot towels . " " I 'm afraid you 've made a mistake , " I told him . " This is n't your apartment . " " Yes , I know that , " he replied . " It belongs to the Dingley sisters . " " No , it belongs to us and we 're not the Dingley sisters or the Andrews sisters or the Corsican brothers either . " " Of course . The Dingley sisters are in our apartment at the Fuji Fantastico ; they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you please . " 22 continued from page 45 The Olympics are a great crucible of what a man is . Since then George has enjoyed his triumph over Frazier . He has been humbled by Muhammad Ali , losing his title . He has still years to go in which he may regain his prestige in the pro ranks . After all , before meeting Frazier , he had won thirty-seven straight fights , thirty-four of them by knockouts , and not a loss in sight . He may hit a winning streak again , or he may not . But what counts in the end is , and will be , George Foreman the man . That man is still striving to fulfill his destiny , whatever that is fated to be . But I might judge that whatever peaks he will scale , and may they be high , I do not believe that in one sense he will ever stand straighter than he did in that glorious moment in the Mexico City ring , when , true to ancient traditions of Olympic greatness and gallantry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pride that I should not ever consent to hold any man higher in my esteem . 23 FINANCIAL NOTE The quickest way to lose your shirt is to put too much on the cuff . ? Lucille J. Goodyear continued from page 100 marred , by formidable gates and numerous checkpoints . But San Diego 's downtown waterfront , the Embarcadero , is strictly for those who are not on business , just pleasure . It is open and inviting . For a Columbus voyage into history , the Berkeley , the Medea and the Star of India are conveniently tied up alongside . The Berkeley , launched in 1898 , is a fine example of the ferryboats that once plied San Francisco Bay . In spite of the modifications to her engine system , the original deck structure and fittings were never altered so that she still retains the 1898 wood paneling , plate-glass mirrors and stain glass windows in the clerestory . Ascending the wide staircase and looking down the long rows of benches , much as they were decades ago , filled then with 1,709 commuters in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 18 , 1906 as the Berkeley was on twenty-four-hour duty evacuating people from the San Francisco earthquake and fire . A much smaller vessel , the Medea is moored adjacent . Down to the silver teapot , everything has been restored as she must have been on those grouse shooting hunts through misty Scottish lochs back in 1904 . She 's a gem of a private yacht , with iron hull , deck house of imported teak , interiors of quarter-sawn English oak . A veteran of action in the two World Wars , the vessel was saved from oblivion by two San Diego citizens who saw her forlorn in a cocoon of Swedish ice and snow . The centerpiece of the waterfront is the magnificent square-rigger , the Star of India , the oldest merchantman afloat . Again , the renovation is superb  --  you peer into the captain 's cabin fully expecting a bearded figure to be poring over charts . It is a wonder how this ship survived . She started with the India trade in 1863 , then on to the England/Australasia emigrant routes , followed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On her maiden voyage she collided with another ship , on her second voyage she lost all three masts in a hurricane ; she has been ice-packed , seen mutiny , rounded the Cape twenty-one times . And in the log there is many an entry like the following : " Ship rolling and labouring in a most distressing manner . . . seas mountain-high ... shipping great quantities of water . " She is a fine ship with a proud berth . Although much remains to be done , the Embarcadero has many attractions , besides the living history of the vessels , to lure the visitor . Broadway Pier , a pleasant boarding area for twenty-five-mile harbor cruises and for clambering on to naval ships , mingles modern landscaping with sights of the old sailor pastime of mending nets . At the Harbor Seafood Mart , around a curve at Harbor Drive and Market Street , the new buildings are not antiseptic-looking but have a salty tang to them . You eat fish and chips looking out on a small boat unloading black and white sea bass . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at sea and , because the weather is calm in San Francisco  --  with lower fish prices  --  the skipper is getting a better return for his catch here . At the rear of the restaurant is a busy packing station with all the fish species imaginable packed in ice . In the same group of buildings there is a modern fresh fish shop with surely the largest selection in the country : filet of shark , totuava , filet of sole , halibut , abalone , lobster , swordfish , rock oysters and crab legs . Within sight of the new developments along the waterfront , yachtsmen are moored by the landing of Anthony 's Star of the Sea Room for a taste of continental cuisine or have crossed the street to Lubach 's , another Holiday magazine award-winning restaurant . At piers all around are large fishing vessels which look as sleek as private luxury yachts . These are the tuna seiners of 150 to 250 feet in length and part of a 130-strong fleet . They are manned mainly by Portuguese , descendants of Cabrillo . If the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they are just back from a grueling diplomatic war with Ecuador over territorial waters . The men work off their frustration in the endless task of repairing the seines , torn by boat , rock , current  --  and tuna . When Richard Henry Dana visited San Diego in 1835 he wrote about the hide industry that flourished along the water 's edge . Today , as one moves from the Embarcadero toward the gray mist of naval vessels ( the last of the mothballed navy has gone to the scrapyard ) , one passes a far mightier industry , that of shipbuilding . Close in , at the Campbell Shipyards , they were handling an order for three 750-passenger ferryboats for the San Francisco Bay area . Piles of metal components littered the yards , like the domain of a tycoon Sanford and Son , and trussed in tall scaffolding were the emerging superseiners . But standing out was the newly painted ferryboat , incongruous , beautiful in its blue and white trim . Some distance away , two more of the aluminum vessels were being fitted together piece @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and its new jaunty sisters were all but juxtaposed . In a lazy lasso loop the new San Diego-Coronado bridge carries passengers to the far side of the harbor . Before 1870 the entire 4,000-acre Coronado Peninsula was valued at $1,000 but progress came swiftly with the opening of an elegant hotel in 1888 . The del Coronado is still highly fashionable , as in its heyday , when millionaires arrived in their private railroad coaches for a vacation of exclusive quiet . The founders wanted the resort to be " the talk of the western world , " and this it has always been . Eight U.S. Presidents have stayed here , along with many foreign dignitaries . The Prince of Wales met Wally Simpson at this hotel , and it provided a backdrop for Marilyn Monroe , starring in Some Like it Hot . This wooden structure , with its outstanding triple Mexican hat roofing , is old-world , like a well-worn leather slipper . A thousand guests can dine under the Crown Room 's sugarpine-paneled ceiling ; the timbers pegged , not nailed together . Guest rooms retain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Old-fashioned fire equipment is stationed in the walkways of the terraced courtyard . ( The modern fire prevention system has earned the hotel the lowest fire insurance rates in the industry ) . At the bakehouse , bread and pastries are still shoveled into the ovens on wooden paddles . Some recent high-rise apartments and a motley collection of naval installations have done little to beautify this stretch of coastline . Fortunately , the developer of " The Cays , " a 400-acre stretch of what was once pig farms and dumping grounds four miles south of the hotel , is creating a worthy companion to the del Coronado and to the superb swimming area which stretches along Silver Strand Beach nearby . Each entity has its own distinctive architecture . Lots do not come cheap ; they range from approximately $50,000 to $150,000 . But the living style is unique  --  so much so that comedian Dick Van Dyke built a summer home here and then moved in permanently . San Diego has many admirers . They visit Balboa Park , Sea World and the Zoo . The harbor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dropped bandanna on the sidewalk . Yet here the city began and here , today , San Diego thrives on mighty industry and healthful pleasure . As varied as the light patterns on the water are the multiple attractions of the bay . Hopefully this brief excursion will have opened up another " point of interest . "
