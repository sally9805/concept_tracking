txt Senior American officials consider the disintegration of a Soviet nuclear-powered space satellite over northwestern Canada a dramatic-sounding event that should not be a cause of maior concern . The Soviet Union is the only nation which uses nuclear power for its space satellites . officials said , adding that the satellite in question did not carry any nuclear weapons . Defense Department sources said they believed the satellite was being used by the Soviets for navigation purposes . The original Soviet announcement of the launching of the satellite last Sept. 18 said that it carried scientific equipment to continue space exploration . Administration officials said that the Soviets had launched satellites carrying nuclear-power reactors more than 10 times in the past , but that on each previous occasion the reactor was boosted into outer space . There the reactor remains for 500 to 1,000 years before decaying and returning harmlessly to earth . The satellite which fell Jan. 24 over a sparsely populated area of northwest Canada did not function properly . Officials said that the U.S. also has launched 22 spacecraft carrying different types of nuclear-power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several years ago , turning to solar power cells to provide electrical energy . The one exception was a small nuclear reactor , SNAP-10A , which was orbited on the Snapshot satellite in 1965 . The reactor failed after 43 days . It was used to power an experimental ion rocket for the Air Force . The satellite now is in an orbit from which it wo n't re-enter for several thousand years . There was some speculation in Washington immediately after the White House announcement of the satellite 's disintegration that " hawks " in the U.S. defense establishment might see a new Soviet threat in such satellites and be encouraged to use the incident to push for a stronger military budget . But the fact that there did not seem to be any military threat involved and that the U.S. itself has experimented with nuclear-powered satellites seemed to rule out that possibility . According to United Press International ( UPI ) , a U.S. military navigation satellite and the lunar module from the abortive Apollo 13 moon mission both carried nuclear-power devices and re-entered the atmosphere in 1964 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carrying a nuclear gen*Please turn to Page 2$ From page 1 U.S. minimizes fall of Soviet satellite erator fell into the Pacific Ocean after a launch failure in 1964 but that the radioactive power source was recovered . In his briefing on the Soviet satellite . Dr. Zbigniew Brzezinski , President Carter 's national security affairs adviser , said that the satellite 's source of power was a nuclear reactor about the size of a three-foot cube which was fed by some 100 pounds of enriched uranium . The nuclear reactor generators used on the Soviet satellites apparently convert the heat from nuclear fission into electricity and are said to provide a more efficient source of power than the solar power cells now used on U.S. satellites . The satellite fell early Jan. 24 over a sparsely populated area east of the Great Slave Lake in Canada 's Northwest Territories . Banjamin Huberman of the U.S. National Security Council told reporters if pieces of the satellite were found , it would be a problem for the Canadians and Soviets to resolve . However , Canadian Defense Minister Barney Dawson told a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that itthe satellite dissipated as it fell through the atmosphere . " At his briefing , Dr. Brzezinski said " the very high probability is that it would break up entirely . " And therefore there is no point speculating on if the reactor had not burned up , which again is almost close to being totally unlikely , " he added . The U.S. became aware last month through its tracking system that the satellite was in trouble and would at some point re-enter the atmosphere . The Soviets were asked to share information on the satellite and did do through the Soviet Ambassador in Washington , Anatoly Dobrynin . Several days ago , Mr. Dobrynin informed Dr. Brzezinski that there was no danger of a nuclear explosion occurring as a result of the satellite 's re-entry into the atmosphere . Thanks to what was described as " complete cooperation " from the Soviets and American tracking of the satellite as it re-entered the earth 's atmosphere , U.S. experts determined that the danger of any significant radioactive contamination was minimal .         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
