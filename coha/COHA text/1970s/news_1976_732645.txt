txt f o h n Allen was talking about his unusual profession . " No , I would n't say we go so far as terror . I would say that we work on the central nervous system , " he was explaining . John Allen is not an interrogator for the CIA . He does not attach electrodes to the heads of rats for unspeakable experiments . No , John Allen designs roller coasters , the giant tooth-rattling kind that for years have sent piercing shrieks hurtling across amusement parks in a peculiarly American rite of summer . In fact , at age 69 , with more than 35 major roller coasters to his credit , John Allen is the dean of American roller-coaster designers , the first man to apply scientific principles to the art of scaring the bejesus out of you . " THEY CALLED ME a young squirt back then , " he said over a late-morning manhattan recently in a comfortable neighborhood restaurant near his Philadelphia home . He was referring to the early thirties , when he got his start as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roller-coaster men did what I call eyeball jobs . But I studied the psychology of roller coasters , how they affect your eyes , ears , your stomach . I began to exploit the senses more . " lie also brought in the slide rule and basic principles of physics , and traveled the country riding roller coasters ; talking to other designers , and quizzing customers as they got off to determine just what made a thrilling ride . The research and the theories paid off . Two years ago a newspaper selection of the 10 greatest roller coasters in North America listed 5 that he had worked on , including the near-legendary 971/2-foot-high ride at Elitch 's Gardens in Denver . , AND THAT SURVEY was made before he built his latest creation , the 110-foothigh Screamin ' Eagle at Six Flags Over Mid-America near St. Louis , billed , by its promoters as " the longest , tallest , and fastest roller coaster in the world ; " " That 's probably my best , because I incorporated everything I learned on he others , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be even better . " Allen eventually became president of Philadelphia Toboggan , today the only maker of the big wooden-framed roller coaster rides . He retired four years ago but still acts as a consultant to the amusement industry . . " The thing I like about it is that I can pick and choose now , do n't have ' to do something I do n't want , " he rumbled . Although Allen is retired , he 's hardly retiring . He 's a genial but gruff-talking sort of fellow , savvy , a ' chain smoker , doting grandfather of five , a man who admits to liking rock music and to disliking " anything old . " H. claims no hobbles but his work .. HE 'S AN ARDENT student of roller : coastering , and points out that the oig rides he builds are generally found only in this country . Europeans go for smaller , more portable versions for traveling. fairs . The advent of the big theme parks lies given the business a shot in the arm . " They have the money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ? " You know , after the Korean War they said the roller coaster was dead . So I set out to prove them wrong . " The proof came in a roller coaster in Canandaigua , N. Y. , that was so successful ' farmers came from 90 miles around ' just to look at it , " he laughed . However , he said later , " What you need in this business in addition to the knowledge is guts . The guts to do it . ' After all , we 're not conveying sides of beef . We 're conveying people . " The trick , of course , is to convey them In such a way that they get the thrill of ; their lives . Allen long ago realized that speed is not everything as far as roller toasters are concerned . ? " MANY YEARS AGO , we built a flying turn in Palisades Park New Jersey ) ? it was sort of a trackless bowl . But it went so fast and so many things happened that when people got off , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minds and their senses were still back on the ride . " The way we do it now , for instance , when we come to the top of a big hill , we cause the cars to hesitate . It gives the riders a chance to look down and ' say , ' My God , look where we 're going . ' Then at the end they 're laughing , they 're so *Minn happy they got through It . " After all , you 're always happy when you 're anticipating disaster and it does n't turn out that way . " The speed and hesitation are only part of what Allen sees as the uniqueness of roller coasters . " What other ride can k e you experience complete weightlessness , and then also increase your weight ? " he asked . He criticized a competitor 's ride as having " lots of speed , lots of centrifugal force  --  but no sensation . " . INDEED , MUCK of Allen 's talk een  --  ters on the concept of sensation , and ue often refers to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a noted neurosurgeon who treated him after he 'd been in a serious train accident . Me talked a lot about the response of the eye , and of the nerves , and how the human ** is a lot slower than people suppose , " he said . " There isa certain transmission time involved .. All our automatic senses have a built-in time delay . " If things happen too fast , the sensation is past , and you really do n't realize it . " Allen has translated his theories into a set of bard scientific equations and formulas that have sent the old " eyeball jobs " packing into obsolesence . He was the first to design his big bill in the shape of a parabola  --  the natural path of any falling object  --  instead of a section of a simple circle . He was also the first to use a tractor-rail down the middle of the track to pull the cars up the first incline , and the first to switch from wooden to aluminum cars . HIS COASTERS ARE always built on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one foot of height . This means , in turn , that each ride takes 55 seconds , " whether the hill is 40 feet high or 100 feet high , " be said . The fastest roller coaster he 's built goes about 60 miles an hour . Although velocity itself is not Allen 's prime concern , he said that " in recent years the biggest increases in speed have come because they 're designing the cars better , reducing the friction . " To get the beht combination of sensation and safety , he designs his bottom curves " so that the radius should not be less than twice the length of the roller-coaster train . " He keeps the maximum centrifugal force in the range of 1.75 Gs , which means a 200 pound passenger would be pushed down into his seat with a force of 350 pounds . ALLEN ALSO WORKS to amazingly close tolerances . He explained that there is a space of 11/2 inches between the main wheels of a car and safety wheels underneath which catch the bottom of the track . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an inch off the track , " he said matter-of-factly . " To the people riding it , it feels like three feet . They 'll come off gasping and say to me , ' Did you know the car left the track ? ' " He Chuckled to himself . " There 's about a 60-foot section of one track we built that is getting rusty because the wheels never touch it . " BUT IT IS NOT all centrifugal force and weightlessness and friction coefficients . There is a little bit of Cupid in every good roller-coaster designer . " On a curve , we very carefully determine how much thrust your body , and the car , can take ; " Allen said disarmingly . " Then we determine what the proper angle would be to bank the curve so that the girl will get thrown into the fella 's arms . " He smiled roguishly : " I devote a great deal of time to tWs.
