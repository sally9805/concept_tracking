Oil with the dance ! Let joy be unconfined : <P> No sleep till morn , when Youth and Pleasure meet <P> To chase the glowing Hours with flying feet . <P> - Lord Byron <P> In their swallow-tailed coats and frilly shirts , their long summer gowns and free-flowing hairdos , they look like characters from a bacchanal in Byron 's own early 19th century London . They rival one another not only in elegance and extravagance but in sheer stamina , for the evening is likely to begin with dinner at a chic restaurant and end with a stylish breakfast at dawn . The revelers are not the bored and idle rich of the land , although tabs run high . The partygoers are high school students who are reviving-and revising-that grand and time-honored institution , the senior prom . <P> Fun Generation . Ignored or mocked during the rebellious 1960s , the senior prom has returned to fashion , partly because of nostalgia , partly because of precocious hedonism and the delights of conspicuous consumption . Not since the 1950s has the prom phenomenon been so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mood of a depoliticized generation that is simply interested in having some fun . Yet today 's promgoers are not just reliving the 1950s in the spirit of Grease , the long-running rock musical that recalls the period with such sardonic songs as It 's Raining on Prom Night and Alone at a Drive-In Movie . <P> This spring 's prom-trotters are crowding into fancy nightclubs like the Chateau de Ville in Framingham , Mass. , where as many as four dances may be going on in one evening , and the management hopes that the girls will come back some day for their weddings . Around Long Beach , Calif. , one of the most popular prom spots is aboard the Queen Mary , now serving as a floating hostelry in her genteel retirement . The ballrooms of the onetime grande dame of the North Atlantic are crowded with ten or so dances a week , and the demand is so high , says Scheduler Ann Hunter , " that we are already booking proms for 1978 . " <P> In the middle-class Chicago suburb of Oak Brook , Ill. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ballroom of the towering Sheraton-Oak Brook Hotel . Looking on genially , Principal William Scheid says , " This is the night they pull out all the stops . " Senior Donald McNeff does just that as he arrives with his date in a chauffeur-driven limousine . He is wearing a white tux and top hat , and he is carrying a cane . Delighted by creating a momentary sensation , he explains : " I wanted to have some fun for once . Everywhere we stopped , people freaked out . " McNeff has arranged to keep the limousine , at a cost of $25 an hour , to carry him and his friends to a nearby motel for several hours of post-prom partying . All told , McNeff figures the evening will cost him $450 , much of it saved from a job that he took with United Parcel just to pay for the occasion .
