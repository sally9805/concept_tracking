For the Defense Department , this was supposed to be the year of the long knives . Even Pentagon friends like Barry Goldwater and Armed Services Committee Chairman John Stennis were talking about ways to economize on defense spending , particularly on the $21.9 billion requested for new weapons systems . But when the fight over the procurement portion of the 1974 budget ended last week , the Defense Department emerged surprisingly unscathed . <P> The Senate not only rejected proposed cuts in money for the new Trident missile-firing submarine , a new Army tank and a nuclear aircraft carrier , but added $495,500,000 for the Navy 's F-14 fighter plane and $296 million for higher military pensions . In addition , it narrowly defeated a huge cut in U.S. forces stationed overseas . <P> In part , the Pentagon victory was engineered in the White House ; President Nixon had threatened to veto anything below $79 billion for fiscal 1974 . But most of the success was the result of the Defense Department 's own efforts . <P> The tactics included a formidable strike force of top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Operations , and Hyman Rickover , retired naval nuclear-power expert , who met personally with almost every Senator on one item or another up for grabs . New Defense Secretary James R. Schlesinger did his part with Congressmen . Using charts , he noted that the outlay requested for fiscal 1974 was the lowest percentage of the gross national product since the end of the Korean War , plummeting from 12% to 5.9% . Expressed in constant 1958 dollars , Pentagon spending has dropped ( see chart ) . <P> This year the Pentagon had asked for $1.3 billion less in its procurement budget than last year . Nonetheless , in the first go-rounds last summer , the House of Representatives stunned the Defense Department by trimming $950 million from the procurement budget ; then the Senate Armed Services Committee recommended cuts of an even greater $1.5 billion . <P> Hall Patrol . In the crunch last week , the Armed Forces and their Senate allies , who were led by Washington Democrat Henry ( " Scoop " ) Jackson , mounted a remarkable goal-line stand . Their toughest test was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. land-based troops stationed abroad by 40% over the next three years . To nearly everyone 's surprise , the Senate , in a technical vote on the language of the amendment , approved the measure by a vote of 49 to 46 . It was five hours later before the actual vote on the amendment itself took place , and the Pentagon lobbyists used the interval to full and frenzied advantage . <P> Schlesinger patrolled the halls , buttonholing Senators to argue that such a drastic cut would weaken NATO and undercut negotiations with the Russians for mutual troop reduction in Europe . It would also save the U.S. little money because the forces would only be brought back to America , not demobilized . Similar arguments were raised by General Andrew J. Goodpaster Jr. , who is the Supreme Allied Commander in Europe and just happened to be in Washington , in telephone calls to key Senators . On the final vote , in which four Senators changed their votes , the Mansfield amendment was defeated , 51 to 44 . A day later the Senators compromised by voting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next two years .
