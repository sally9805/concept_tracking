Having worked " to achieve a lasting peace in the world , " President Nixon served notice last week that he has turned to the task of gaining " peace in our own land . " It was time , said the President , for an escalation in the war on crime . Devoting the sixth of his series of State of the Union messages to the criminal-justice system , Nixon claimed that " dramatic progress " had been made in his first four years . That , he said , proved the merits of his philosophy " that the only way to attack crime in America is the way crime attacks our people-without pity . " <P> Some of his more interesting specific recommendations : <P> CAPITAL PUNISHMENT . The President urged a new federal law imposing the death penalty for war-related treason , sabotage and espionage and where death results from such serious federal offenses as skyjacking , kidnaping and assaulting a federal official . To meet the Supreme Court 's objections to the arbitrary and capricious way death penalties have been meted out , Nixon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first decide guilt or innocence ; then at a subsequent hearing , a judge and jury would consider whether there had been any mitigating circumstances or whether the crime had been particularly heinous . Where the jury concluded that the crime had been especially serious and there had been no mitigating factors , death would be mandatory . It is not certain , however , that the Supreme Court would go along since prosecutors , jurors and the President would all continue to have discretion on whether to consider reduced charges or on whose sentence to commute . <P> DRUGS . Anyone found guilty of trafficking in more than four ounces of a substance containing heroin or morphine and who had a previous drug-felony conviction would automatically receive life imprisonment without possibility of parole . The lowest penalty for a trafficker would be from five to 15 years for a first offense involving less than four ounces . Accused pushers would not be allowed bail unless they could prove that they were not a " danger " to the community . That proposal constitutes a substantial hardening of the Nixon-proposed general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very well in the District of Columbia . <P> INSANITY . To end " the present absurd use of the insanity defense , " no plea on the defendant 's mental state would be permitted at trial except the contention that he did not know what he was doing - " for example , whether the defendant knew he was pulling the trigger of a gun . " If the jury decided that he had actually committed a crime , the convicted defendant could then introduce broad evidence on his sanity so that the judge could decide whether he should be imprisoned or sent to a mental institution .
