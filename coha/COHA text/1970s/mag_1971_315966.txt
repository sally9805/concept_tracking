ONCE again the Congress faced a question of national priorities . Much of U.S. labor and all of the aerospace industry had rallied behind the supersonic transport aircraft as a symbol of technological supremacy . In one of those massive lobbying campaigns that had proved so effective in the past , the professional persuaders argued that U.S. prestige , thousands of jobs and billions of dollars in profits were at stake in the continued development of the plane . The pressure , economic and nationalistic , seemed irresistible . But last week the House of Representatives , which had staunchly supported the SST through ten years of controversy , stunningly reversed itself and voted to terminate all funds for the aircraft . <P> The SST 's critics had revived all of the specters of environmental damage that a fleet of SSTs might inflict , including a frightening and seemingly exaggerated new emphasis on the increased hazards of skin cancer . <P> But basically they asked , " Who needs it ? " With the nation 's cities decaying , government at all levels screaming for financial aid , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used to help a relatively small number of passengers reach London and Paris a little faster ? With the British , French and Russians already marketing a possibly uneconomical SST and worrying about selling it , why should the U.S. taxpayer be asked to join the gamble ? On the other hand , if the plane was as surefire a moneymaker as its backers claimed , why not let free enterprise take the risk and reap the profits ? <P> Accountable . Those were the arguments as House leaders of both parties urged their followers to vote what amounts to another $134 million to complete two SST prototypes , and thus to retain the possibility of salvaging something from the $864 million in tax money already invested . Both the galleries and the floor of the House were packed-a rarity in that chamber-as the SST debate neared its close . The strong feeling on both sides was audible . A guttural murmuring of distaste swept the floor as Democratic Floor Leader Hale Boggs harangued the House in support of the aircraft and was caught fudging about previous House votes on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yates . " If you vote for the SST , " shouted Republican Leader Gerald Ford , " you are insuring 13,000 jobs today plus 50,000 jobs in the second tier and 150,000 jobs each year over the next ten years . " <P> Finally , Yates regained the floor . " I demand tellers with clerks , " he said , setting in motion a new House procedure* in which each member 's vote on critical amendments is recorded . In the past , Congressmen voted secretly on those motions that really shape a bill , without their constituents knowing their positions ; only their final votes on bills as amended were made public . Now , the possibility of being held accountable to the voters back home is a reality-and a sobering one to judge by what ensued on the SST amendment .
