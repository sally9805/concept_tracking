THE MUPPET MOVIE <P> Directed by James Frawley <P> Screenplay by Jerry Juhl and Jack Burns <P> Muppets by Jim Henson , Frank Oz <P> and friends <P> Kermit is sitting on a log in a swamp , and he has just played his big mandolin solo , which went very well . But now , trouble : a fly buzzes past him , and he flicks at it with his tongue . He misses . " First thing to go on a frog , his tongue . ' ' says Kermit , remembering the great days when he could make the double play-fly to mosquito to gullet-with ease . But Dom DeLuise , the Hollywood agent who has rowed by in a boat , just a touch lost , is tired of wasting time . " I 've got to catch a plane , " he says , looking at his watch . Kermit thinks this over . " Not with that tongue , " he says professionally . <P> And we 're off , in a wobbly way , as Kermit , the fast-talking fabric amphibian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hollywood to answer a Variety ad that seeks " all frogs wishing to become rich and famous . " He collects many of his Muppet pals along the way-Fozzie , the apologetic bear : Gonzo , the not quite turkey ; Miss Piggy , the karate queen in the lavender gloves ; Dr. Teeth and his Electric Mayhem band ; Dr. Bunsen Honeydew , the melon-brained mad scientist , and his twittering assistant Beaker . A human villain tries to kidnap Kermit to shill for his chain of French-fried frogs ' legs restaurants . When things look black , Kermit says in despair , " All I can think of is millions of frogs on tiny crutches . " As is true with the TV show , human actors have no trouble playing with Muppets . Bob Hope sells ice cream at a fair , and Kermit chooses dragonfly ripple . Milton Berle runs Madman Mooney 's Hubcap Heaven , a very used car lot , and Steve Martin is loathsomely realistic as a hostile waiter . Edgar Bergen and Charlie McCarthy also make a brief appearance , one of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of short , froggy Kermit , has made a gallant gesture in dedicating the movie to Bergen 's " memory and magic . " <P> Statler and Waldorf , the old geezers who heckle the TV show , pop up long enough for Statler to say , " I 've seen detergents that leave better films than this . " This is too harsh , though even an addicted Muppet fan must admit that the movie has draggy stretches . The transition from the **25;8292;TOOLONG lunacy of the TV show to the coherent narration of the film is not a complete success . Muppet magic remains a bewildering succession of wonderful bits , and perhaps the movie 's best occurs when Rowlf the Dog , who is a barroom pianist , commiserates with Kermit , who has just been deserted by Miss Piggy . The two sing a nice , rueful song about women-the can't-live-with-them , can't-live-without-them kind of thing . When Kermit slopes off into the night . Rowlf philosophizes : " It 's not often you see a guy that green have the blues that bad . "  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
