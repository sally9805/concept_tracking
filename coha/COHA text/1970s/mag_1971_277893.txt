REMEMBER the college graduate of 1968 ? Standing there on commencement day with diploma in one hand and a bundle of job offers in the other ? Seniors that June scarcely had to look for work . Their main problem seemed to be deciding which corporation offered the best opportunities , or which fellowship led to the most promising future . <P> Not any more . The recession may be just about over in the marketplace , but its effects linger on the nation 's campuses . The largest graduating class in history-an educated army of 816,000-is entering America 's certified credential society and learning to its sorrow that a degree is no guarantee of a suitable job . Like the dollar , the diploma seems to have been devalued . At Boston 's Northeastern University , a sign in the placement office reads " Grave New World . " <P> The high-ranking seniors of ' 71-at least from the best colleges-will have no serious trouble finding employment . But they may have to work harder at selling themselves to an employer , the job may not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be lower than they like . They will certainly not , as in the past , have jobs conferred upon them . " Normally a placement director is wined and dined by firms wanting to ingratiate themselves with the institution , " says Cornell Placement Chief John Munschauer . " This year no one even bought me lunch . " Corporate recruiters still visit campuses , but not so frequently or enthusiastically as before . At Princeton , there were 85 recruiters this spring compared to 169 in 1968 . The engineering school at the University of Kansas greeted 55 recruiters this semester , down from 255 three years ago . In many cases there was less recruiting because the recruiters themselves had been fired . <P> The actual job offers told an even grimmer story . A survey of 140 U.S. colleges and universities indicated that between March 1970 and March 1971 , job bids for male B.A.s dropped 61% , and a staggering 78% for Ph.D.s . Actual hiring will be down less , probably by 25% at the B.A. level . A possibly incomplete but telling poll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sciences division of the University of Wisconsin last year showed that only 174 were working full time ; and of that number , only about half had the kind of job they wanted . <P> Intellectual Proletariat <P> On campus , the reaction to the dearth of jobs ranges from nonchalance to panic to anger-an anger often directed at the colleges that trained the students to no seeming purpose . Some speak darkly about the creation of a new " intellectual proletariat " in the U.S. <P> " Just like Ceylon , " says Columbia Senior Roy Rosenzweig , a history major , " where 10,000 people went to college and could n't get jobs . " He might have added India , Latin America and Africa . TIME Correspondent Frank Merrick , who recently visited several big Midwestern universities , " was amazed that so many students seemed to be drifting , bewildered by what was happening to them and resentful that no employer seemed to want to hire them . " <P> On the other hand , there are thousands of seniors this year who seemingly could not care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New Consciousness of America 's youth-including an indifferent attitude toward the Protestant work ethic-has
