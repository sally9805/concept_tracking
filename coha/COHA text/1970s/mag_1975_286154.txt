Port St. Joe , in the panhandle of Florida , is in one of those swampy , redneck , Southern counties where everything moves at a slow and measured pace-except the courts when they are dealing with black defendants . After Freddie Pitts and Wilbert Lee were charged with murder , it took just three weeks before they were found guilty and sentenced to the electric chair . Evidence suggesting that their " confessions " had been coerced slowed the process not a bit . Later investigations strongly suggested that the two men were innocent but by then the local law was back in its familiar subtropical torpor . So it was not until last week , twelve years after they were first locked up , that Pitts and Lee were finally set free . <P> It all began one hot July night in 1963 . Two white attendants at the Mo-Jo gas station , just outside Port St. Joe , were robbed , taken into the woods , told to lie down and then shot dead . Police learned that earlier in the evening a group of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about using a whites-only restroom . Pitts and Lee , who were part of the group , were apparently beaten after their arrest , and they soon pleaded guilty . Once behind bars , though , they persisted in claiming they were innocent . Three years later while the two were still on death row at the state prison in Raiford , a lie detector expert working on a different case got a taped confession to the Port St. Joe murders from Curtis Adams Jr. , a white man who had already been convicted of another murder . Pulitzer-prizewinning Reporter Gene Miller of the Miami Herald began an investigation that helped win a new trial for Pitts and Lee in 1972 . The two men were so hopeful about the outcome that just before their second trip to court , they passed up a chance to join a jailbreak . <P> But Adams refused to repeat his confession on the stand , the tape made by the lie detector expert was barred as hearsay evidence , and the all-white jury took only 90 minutes to find Pitts and Lee guilty of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , said a shaken defense attorney , even " if the Twelve Apostles testified for them . " Refusing to give up , Miller* and others continued to fight until Governor Reubin Askew agreed to order a new investigation a year and a half ago . Askew personally participated in part of the inquiry and sent his legal aide to talk with Adams . He confessed again , recanted and then confessed a third time to Florida Attorney General Robert Shevin . <P> $100 Each . Persuaded that Adams had " information that would be very difficult to recount without knowledge of the commission of the crime , " Askew earlier this month concluded that " substantial doubt exists as to the guilt of Pitts and Lee . " He recommended that they be given a full pardon . Under Florida law , the Governor needed the concurrence of at least three of his cabinet officers , who are independently elected . Last week the third O.K. came , and Pitts , 31 , and Lee , 40 , walked out of Raiford . The state gave them $100 each . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hatred . " Said Lee just before he got out : " I wo n't believe it until I 'm 300 miles away from this place . " Back at Port St. Joe , the present owner of the Mo-Jo said , " If they were innocent , they never would have been convicted . "
