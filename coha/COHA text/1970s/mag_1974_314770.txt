After Maria Gambarelli had her arthritic right hip joint repaired in 1961 , she was so incapacitated that her career as a ballet dancer and teacher came to a halt . But last year she underwent a hip-joint replacement to correct the problems that persisted after the first operation . Since then she has recovered so completely that she has taken up teaching ballet again . Last week , at a Manhattan news conference , she demonstrated her renewed ability to perform classical ballet movements . " I feel like a marvelous car , " she said . " They have put in a new part , and I am like a brand-new Cadillac or Rolls-Royce . " <P> The occasion was the granting of a major medical award to the man who made possible her recovery and that of thousands of others : British Surgeon John Charnley , 63 , who last week won the Albert and Mary Lasker Award for clinical research ( $10,000 ) for developing the modern artificial hip joint . <P> Charnley , a surgeon at England 's Wrightington Hospital in Wigan , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hip 's ball-and-socket joint . Doctors had long been substituting a stainless-steel ball for the head of the femur , or thighbone . But even after the introduction of better bone cements eliminated one problem-the tendency of the new head to work loose-the results of the operation were often unsatisfactory . Because body fluids provided inadequate lubrication and even corroded the implants , friction between the ball and its socket caused both to wear . <P> Charnley began to search for materials that would require no lubrication . He first tried Teflon , but the material tended to wear badly in the hip joint . Then he made a serendipitous discovery . Although Charnley had turned away a salesman who tried to interest him in high-density polyethylene , his laboratory assistant , eager to use idle test apparatus , tried four samples of the tough plastic . The material tested so successfully that in 1962 , Charnley adopted it for hip sockets . <P> Until Charnley , victims of advanced arthritis or injuries to the hip were often permanently crippled . Now , in the U.S. alone , many of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not only back on their feet , but dancing . <P> The Lasker Foundation also handed out $5,000 awards for basic research to four of the country 's leading cancer investigators . Dr. Ludwik Gross of The Bronx Veterans Administration Hospital was cited for his discovery of animal leukemia viruses . Dr. Sol Spiegelman of Columbia University was honored for the first successful synthesis of an infectious virus-like particle . Dr. Howard Temin of the University of Wisconsin was recognized for his studies of how viruses reproduce . Dr. Howard Skipper of Birmingham 's Southern Research Institute was cited for his work in biochemistry and cell biology . Medicine is still far from finding a " cure " for cancer . But without the understanding that these researchers have provided , the search would be more difficult .
