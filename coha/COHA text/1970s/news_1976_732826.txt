txt 1VIIEN WE OFFER thanks today , I guess , we 're supposed to offer them to I h. molter . Well , I know a guy He ( wart mane very well . And then He gave him a few more millstones , too . The guy 's name is Joseph Kadiub , and It 's alestimony to the strength of human will That he probably has ' more thanks to give this year than the rest of us . Joseph is 23 and mentally retarded  --  a term I hale . He is legally blind . Until recently he weighed close to 360 pounds . He is also , for all practical purposes , an orphan . WHEN JOSEPH was a year old , he was treated at St. Vincent 's Hospital for malnutrition and neglect . At 3 he was taken from his mother  --  whom he has n't seen since  --  and placed in a succession of five foster homes in four years , At 7 he was committed , on a mental-deficiency petition , to the Lincoln State School for the Mentally Retarded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day , in 1971 , when he decided he wanted to get out and live like anyone else . That meant a paying job , a place of his own , and freedom of movement . But I prefer to let him tell it : " AT LINCOLN there was this big row ci beds on one side , a big row of beds the other side . In the middle , people just played around . " They had jobs at Lincoln , but they play dirty . You did n't get paid or nothlag . And some sit down and do nothing while I do all the work . " I had went on trips outside , and I felt like something ; so told people I wanted to leave , that I 'm not sick . I 'm not siert ? dt all . " I said I wanted to go to stores and all that stuff . I do n't like to be closed in . I went to be someplace I can just go out . " AS YOU 'VE noticed , Joseph has a speech @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ due in part to spending most of his life around people more retarded than he . It took time , but Joseph was finally sent to a private sheltered-care facility , with the state paying the tab . But Joseph did n't like it there either . " They keep the doors open and people steal . And there were 200 people , and too many nurses . I said Lincoln State the same thing as here . " What lie wanted was someone to teach him skills he sensed he needed to live on his own . The skills he wanted would hurt your heart : Cooking . Doing laundry . Riding the bus : - Counting money . Paying bills . An immersion course in simple self-respect . THREE YEARS ago Joseph , living In yet another residential shelter , was placed in the vocational program of the Chicago School and Workshop for the Retarded . The school operates workshops for people wills moderate mental handicaps . They work on assembly lines that simulate real working conditions , packaging goods and fitting parts together for private industry . Joseph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when he was at Lincoln , to 57 , then to 97 . He has shed more than 40 pounds . Ile has become what his work supervisor , Rudy Herdeck , calls " the best pack er we 've got " ; the remark caused Joseph to shrug modestly and reply , " It 's just my hands , they do tfie work . " A year ago , Joseph was accepted at Renaissance House , 2001 W. Devon Av. , the residential facility of the Chicago School and Workshop . THE COAL of the workshops is to place the school 's hundreds of workers  --  many of whom will live in shelters or with their families the rest of their lives ? in private day jobs . The goal of Renaissance House  --  which is more selective and has only 20 residents ? is to teach living on one 's own . If you think Jimmy Carter has been born again , you ought to sae Joseph . He has learned to cook , showing an excessive fondness for cheeseburgers . He has been taught how to care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Once a week he takes a money-management course , in which he learns how to save  --  from the BO cents an hour he makes at the workshop and the $25 a month he gets from the state benefits that support him at Renaissance House . BECAUSE HE now travels freely about town by himself  --  and has discovered shopping ? he has only $11 saved . But he 's getting better at budgeting . " Ile 's frugal , he does n't try to buy everything , " Claire Hellstern , a public-health nurse who has befriended him , said kindly . Joseph shook his head sadly . " Sometimes I do , sometimes I do n't , " he said . Perhaps the most amazing thing about Joseph is his skiing . Since 1974 he has been a part of the Blind Outdoor Leisure program and has been to Aspen and Snowmass tour times . He skis with poles attached to those of a guide behind him . A tug lets hint know when to turn . Last year he went by himself : Took a cab to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with an Aspen ski instructor who has become his good and great friend . " I WAS SCARED , but I made it anyway . Went there and came back , " Joseph said . " We were more nervous than he was , " said Bill Applington , program director at Renaissance House . Why ' do I write about all this at Thanksgiving ? Because Joseph 's about to get his wish . Soon he 'll graduate from the Levy Workshop , 6610 N. Clark St. , to Chicago School 's placement center at Montrose and Ravenswood . He 'll get intensive training while they find him a full-time outside job . He 's also moving into the " training " apartment at Renaissance House , with a roommate , Eddie . They will live by themselves , away from the other group , to simulate independent living . And sometime before next June , Joseph Kadlub will move to an apartment of his own ? maybe even in Aspen . " Clean air , a small town , and nice Tribune Pholo b , Rev Gore Joseph Kadlub @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clothing rack . mountains , " Joseph noted . HIS COUNSELORS talk a lot about his great motivation , his long concentration span , his will to make it . But he might have lived out his life in the vegetable patch had he not grasped some simple truths . " It makes me feel good to work , just to do something . It means I do n't be lazy , " he told me . " I 'd like to grow up and see what 's outside and have friends . " I got my wish . It came out good . ' Cause I just do n't like to be locked up and not do nothing . " I can add nothing more to that , Joe
