The usually understated Arthur Burns , chairman of the Federal Reserve Board , made no attempt to play down the dramatic resolution last week of Franklin National Bank 's vault of trou bles . " The entire financial world , " said he , " can breathe more easily , not only in this country but abroad . " <P> In fact , Franklin 's shocking saga of mistakes and mismanagement had caused fears that the nation 's banking system was shaky and that lack of public confidence might lead to a run on many banks . The end came surgically , as U.S. Comptroller of the Currency James Smith declared that Franklin , once the 20th largest of the nation 's more than 14,000 banks , was insolvent . <P> To the relief of depositors and other bankers , Smith announced that Franklin 's 104 branches would be taken over immediately by European-American Bank &; Trust Co. , a little-known consortium of six major European banks . <P> Thus Franklin 's flop , the largest bank failure in U.S. history , had turned into what Burns modestly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began in 1964 , when Franklin National expanded from its home base on Long Island into Manhattan . In the fiercely competitive Manhattan market , established banks had long ago signed up most of the solid corporate customers . Franklin National felt obliged to make many high-risk loans to young companies . Eager to impress , Franklin also saddled itself with some 25% more space than it needed in plush offices on Park Avenue and elsewhere . <P> Wild Gambles . By 1970 Franklin was beginning to suffer steadily declining operating earnings . Last May the situation had become so bad that its managers concluded that the only way the bank could survive was through a merger . Then Chairman Harold Gleason got devastating news : Franklin had lost some $39 million because of un authorized trading in foreign currencies . <P> Five weeks later the bank reported that its losses for the first five months of 1974 actually totaled a numbing $63.6 million . The reason for part of these gi gantic losses is still mysterious . Some analysts believe that wild gambles on the swings of foreign exchange rates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in charge . <P> Frightened depositors began making massive withdrawals . In desperation , Franklin National turned to the Federal Reserve System , which bailed it out with loans totaling $1.75 billion , the biggest outlay it had ever made to a member bank . <P> Problems worsened when reports began to leak that the Securities and Exchange Commission was investigating Franklin 's dealings with an obscure Swiss bank called Amincor . The Swiss may have helped to arrange two foreign-currency sales for Franklin that resulted in phony profits of $4 million . This buttressed Franklin 's shaky finances and enabled it to pay stockholders their dividends . Somewhere in the picture may have been the shadowy Milan-based international financier , Michele Sindona , who bought 22% of Franklin stock in 1972 and now is in mushrooming legal difficulty with the Italian government .
