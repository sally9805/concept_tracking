Those who are behind , said President Ford , " try harder-and sometimes swing wilder too . " Ford was trying to dismiss one of Challenger Ronald Reagan 's wild , but nonetheless effective swings : his claims that the President and his old colleagues in Congress had allowed the Soviet Union to surpass the U.S. in military might . Reagan 's startling victories in Texas and Indiana seemed in part to show that he was on to a hot campaign issue : whether the U.S. has indeed become No. 2 behind the Soviets in military strength . It is also a familiar topic in U.S. political history ; the " missile gap " argument was a major part of the 1960 campaign . <P> Ford has been trying to counter Reagan 's claims with variations of a basic theme : " We are absolutely unsurpassed in military capability , and we have the power to deter aggression , to maintain the peace , and to protect our national security . " As Reagan pressed his charges , Ford began taking some well-publicized steps aimed at proving that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way . As a bemedaled American officer put it : " There 's no question that the more Reagan sticks it to him , the more dollars we 're going to see . " Items : <P> - Ford supported building the B-l supersonic strategic bomber ( at roughly $87.8 million apiece ) , although final tests are not scheduled to be completed until this fall . <P> - Having already submitted to Congress the biggest defense budget in history - $112.7 billion in spending requests-the President asked for an additional $322 million last month for 60 Minuteman III missiles . Each is armed with three nuclear warheads that can be separately targeted . <P> - With $6.3 billion already requested to build new ships for the Navy , Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld asked the Senate Armed Services Committee to add another $1.2 billion . The total would build 21 ships for the U.S. fleet . <P> Rumsfeld insisted that it was " plainly outrageous " to suggest that the request for new funds was linked to the President 's loss to Reagan in Texas . To be sure , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning of the day that Texans were balloting , but the decision was only a tentative one . The final go-ahead was given later . <P> No matter how much Ford says and does , Reagan seems to go on scoring points by exploiting the defense issue . In a rare display of public anger , Ford lashed out at his opponent just before the Texas primary as a man whose " simplistic " approach to national-security problems could lead him to make " irresponsible and fundamentally harmful policy decisions " if he ever did become President . <P> Reagan does have a tendency to speak glibly of defense matters . He has said that the U.S. should exploit its lead in technology to offset Soviet numerical superiority . No one could quarrel with that aim-indeed , it is a basic premise of U.S. strategy . But Reagan went on to suggest using the cruise missile to counter Soviet tanks . Still under development , the cruise missile is no battlefield weapon ; armed with a nuclear or conventional warhead , it will be launched from aircraft or naval vessels against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
