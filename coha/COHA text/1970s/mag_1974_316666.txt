Despite disturbing signs of voter apathy , the 1974 elections could bring significant changes in the U.S. political landscape . Republicans can not seem to escape the obloquy of Watergate and a mismanaged economy . In governorships , the Democrats now hold a 32-to-18 edge , hope to increase it to 38-to-12 . In the Senate , the Democrats hope to improve their current majority of 58-to-42 by three or four seats . In the House , with all 435 seats at issue , the Democrats look to improve their present 248-to-187 standing by anywhere from 30 to 50 seats . With the balloting barely three weeks off , herewith a sampling of races for the statehouses , the Senate and the House : <P> <P> CAREY v. WILSON <P> No matter who the Democrats put up against Nelson Rockefeller-local hero , national figure-he inevitably went down to defeat . But now the invincible Rocky has gone to his reward in Washington , and his No. 2 man for 15 years , Malcolm Wilson , 60 , is trying to keep the governorship for the Republicans . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ punch with the electorate . <P> The Democrats think they are finally in a position to recapture statehouse and the polls bear them out , showing Brooklyn Congressman Hugh Carey , 55 , with an almost 2-to-1 lead . <P> No high-powered thinker or speaker , Carey talks the language of New York City in a genial , gravelly voice . A traditional bread-and-butter liberal , he is taking cautious stands against taxes and busing and a moderate environmentalist position . He promises to block President Ford 's surtax proposal from his post on the House Ways and Means Committee . An Irish Catholic widower with twelve children and no trace of limousine liberal snobbery , he is likely to win back much of the ethnic vote that has been deserting to the Republicans . He is aided in this effort by the Democratic candidate for Lieutenant Governor , Mary Anne Krupsak , 42 , who should pick up a sizable share of the Polish and woman 's vote . <P> As the underdog , Wilson has begun to show some uncharacteristically sharp teeth . Making crime his top issue , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the streets and subways of muggers and calling Krupsak " soft on crime . " He has one clear advantage over Carey . He is much more amply financed than his opponent , who spent most of his funds for television time in the primary . But unless Wilson changes voters ' minds with a last-minute TV drive , he is destined to be outgunned by Carey . <P> <P> RHODES v. GILLIGAN <P> Ohio voters could not have been presented with two more starkly contrasting candidates . Incumbent John Gilligan , 53 , is a former college instructor who pushed through the state 's first income tax and upgraded public services , especially the underfinanced school system . James Rhodes , 65 , who spent eight years in the statehouse at Columbus before Gilligan succeeded him , kept taxes at the lowest level , in comparison to income , of any state in the nation and maintained social services at approximately the same level .
