txt Premier Rashid Karami said tonight in the National Assembly that the Lebanese Government was considering calling in troops from Morocco and Tunisia or other Arab countries to help defend Lebanon against Israel . He said that the Cabinet would make a decision on such a move tomorrow and would submit its plan to the Assembly on Thursday . The Premier 's statement was made after a report had reached the Assembly that Israel was planning continuous patrols , on both sides of the Israeli-Lebanese border .

The observers pointed out that it would take months to bring in Moroccan or Tunisian forces , while the Iraqis could reach Lebanon in hours . It was also pointed out , however , that Morocco and Tunisia , along with Lebanon , are considered moderate Arab countries .
