THE TALK OF THE TOWN Notes and Comment THE seizure of the American Embassy in Iran and sixty-two of its American employees and their dependents by supporters of Aya  --  tollah Khomeini , Iran 's violent holy man and atavistic political leader , has provoked a remarkably uniform two-stage reaction among people at every level of American life . First has come the imperative , visceral impulse to take radical action , perhaps of a military nature , to get our kidnapped country  --  men back , and then has come the so  --  ber , paralyzing realization that such moves are just the kind of thing to get the hostages killed . Unwilling to accept America 's helplessness in the face of outrageous blackmail but also unwill  --  ing to place the lives of the hostages in greater danger , people all over the country have found their emotions swinging wildly between fury and anxiety , belligerence and solicitude . The peculiar torment of the Ameri  --  can position was summed up by an angry American demonstrator against the Iranian action who blurted Out to a television @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world apart ought to he able to save sixty people . " Unfortu  --  nately , whatever else it may he good for , our ability to blow up half the world turns out to be of no use at all when it comes to protecting hostages in the hands of crazed religious fa  --  natics . Many people , apparently exasperated beyond endurance by the monumental uselessness of our arsenal , have sought to explain our country 's military inac  --  tion by assuming its military weakness . Actually , none of the conceivable op-dons of force are foreclosed to us by a lack of military means  --  or , for that matter , by a lack of martial will . We are free at any instant to unleash vio  --  lence on any scale  --  from the mere retaliatory seizure of Iranian personnel in Washington to the nuclear oblitera  --  tion of Iran , which could he carried out in about ten minutes , with no mili  --  tary risk to us . Our failure to take re  --  taliatory steps ( except for the Presi  --  dent 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  tion authorities , his freezing of Iranian assets in the United States , and the oddly appropriate self-punishing " retaliation " of declining to buy oil from Iran any longer ) speaks not for any military de  --  ficiency or wavering will but for our humanity and good sense ; humanity because it shows reluctance to accept the advice of the destroy-them-in-order-to  --  save-them tactical school and sacrifice the hostages ; good sense because we know that whatever there is of interna  --  tional order , which all nations depend on for their survival , requires the glob  --  al observance of diplomatic immunity . We hold hack from responding in kind to the Iranian transgressions because we value our own nation 's standards of conduct more highly than we value the dubious satisfactions of bloody revenge . No fear , loss of nerve , or collapse of will is involved . No humiliation is suf  --  fered . Secure in the knowledge that we possess boundless military might , we deliberately forgo its use , and choose the policy of restraint , out of respect for the lives of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in " standing up to " the United States demonstrate any strength or courage on the part of that nation , Kidnapping , even when it is used by a small nation against a large one , is essentially a cowardly weapon . Its special ignobility lies in the fact that it capitalizes on the scruples of the foe . The political kid  --  napper , instead of relying on his own strength and courage  --  as soldiers do in a military action uses the humanity of his adversary as his shield . In the present instance , Ayatollah Khomeini relies for his and Iran 's protection on America 's respect for international law and for life . That we continue to show this respect in the face of his extreme provocations is a sign of national strength . ? ? stamp AFRIEND stopped by our office the other day to show us a post  --  age stamp . It was a familiar-looking stamp , printed in red , deep blue , and dark gray and depicting an American flag , around which was the legend " THE LAND OF THE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Since our friend seemed upset , we asked him what was the matter . " These stripes , " he said , pointing to the flag design . " Any child knows that the American flag has thirteen stripes . This flag has fifteen stripes . Is it a misprint ? Is the stamp a collector 's item ? Is it an error on the scale of the famous ' upside-down rennv ' ? that twenty-four-cent airmail stamp of 1918 on which the airplane was mistakenly printed upside down ? How could this have happened ? Why ? " After soothing our friend with a cup of tea , we placed a call to the United States Postal Service in Washing  --  ton . In the Public and Employee Com  --  munications Department we reached a man who gave his name as Ron Powell . Speaking in a calm and in  --  telligent voice , he said , " Tell your friend not to worry . The stamp is just as it should he . It was issued in June , 1978 . It is part of the Postal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important events in the nation 's history . This particular stamp commemorates the battle of Fort McHenry , which was fought in September of 1814 . It was this battle that inspired Francis Scott Key to write The Star-Spangled Banner . ' At that time , the United States flag did have fifteen stripes . You will remember that during this country 's early years the government 's intention was to increase the number of stars and the number of stripes each time a new state joined the union  --  a nice idea , if the country had n't grown so large . The fifteen-stripe flag was the official flag from 1795 until 1818 , the year in which Congress decided to return the number of stripes to thirteen , to represent the original states . " Mr. Powell suggested that we might learn more from the Bureau of En  --  graving and Printing , which is part of the Department of the Treasury , and which not only prints all United States postage stamps but also designs , en  --  graves , and prints all the country 's paper currency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call to the Bureau , where we reached Herbert Krisak , the superintendent of the Bureau 's Management Services Division . Mr. Krisak , who also spoke in a calm and intelligent voice , told us that his office had received a number of letters con  --  cerning the fifteen-stripe-flag stamp , and that most of the letters included phrases like " gross incompetence " and " bureaucratic bumbling . " He said that all such letters are answered politely , and he added that designs for postage stamps are decided upon by an advisory committee of the Postal Service and are carried out either by free-lance com  --  mercial artists or by artists within the Bureau . In the case of the Fort Mc  --  Henry stamp , he said , the design was executed by an artist named V. Jack Blither , who is one of six banknote de  --  signers who work for the Bureau . We thanked Mr. Krisak and put in a call to Mr. Rather . He , too , spoke in a calm and intelligent voice , and he told us that after the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stamp the idea had been sent to the Bureau , and that he had been asked to do the design . " What they wanted was the Fort McHenry flag the way it looked nn the night before the Brit  --  ish bombardment , " Mr. Ruther said . " As far as / know , there are no pic  --  tures of the flag as it was then , but the flag itself hangs in the National Museum of History and Technology , which is part of the Smithsonian . went over and looked at it . It 's enor  --  mous  --  it 's about two stories high  --  and it 's all tattered and has a big hole in it . Basing my ideas on what I saw , I did several trial designs . In one of them , I included a flagpole , but we decided that , for purposes of printing , it would make the design ton busy . After my final design had been ap  --  proved by the advisory committee and the Postmaster General  --  you 'll notice that it shows a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water-based paint , about five times as big as the actual stamp . The design was then photo  --  graphically reduced , and engraved and printed . Ever since the stamp was is  --  sued , people have been asking me about it , including even some of our own printers , who were sure there was something wrong with it . I told them the story , of course . People often do ask me questions about stamps , but half the time I ca n't answer them . I 'm not a philatelist , you see . I just design stamps . " We thanked Mr. Ruther , wished him luck , and hung up . After we had explained the situation to our friend , he finished his tea and left our office looking cheered . Renewed Acquaintance IT 'S been fifty-four years since we first mentioned Ruth von Phul in these columns , so we thought it was about time we looked her up again . We took note of Mrs. von Phul in our April 4 , 1925 , issue , when she was in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Simon &; Schuster ( we spelled it " Shuster " then , and herewith apologize ) was promoting the newfangled addiction . We called on Mrs. von Phul , now a widow and great-grandmother , at her Park Avenue apartment the other day . " I do n't do crosswords much anymore , because I read with difficulty and it 's hard to make out all those numbers , " she told us . " But when I do do them I much prefer the English variety  --  espe  --  cially the ones in the London Sunday Times . I loathe the New York Times Sunday puzzle . Too easy , for one thing . And then all that cuteness . Ugh . " We asked Mrs. von Phul what she 'd been up to since John Hylan was May  --  or of New York . " For a while , I seemed mainly to he moving , " she said . " I had grown up in the city , and attended Horace Mann School . It had a girls ' high then , in the Teachers College complex . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my father , a lawyer , wanted me to go there  --  I 'd have preferred Barnard . My parents were very advanced and gay  --  oh dear , that word is lost !  --  and my mother even smoked . I never finished college , because I discovered Harvard and Harvard discovered me . My husband-to-be , who died two years ago , was studying there . He was a civil engineer , originally from New Or  --  leans , who specialized in pipelines . Be  --  tween 1925 and 1950 , we lived in  --  let 's see  --  Syracuse , Colorado Springs , Baton Rouge , Dallas , Los Angeles , and probably a couple of other places , but they do n't come instantly to mind . I was kept pretty busy packing and un  --  packing and raising two daughters , but I did keep up my interest in words . At the start of the Second World War , I was in New York again and took a course in cryptanalysis at Hunter . Within a few months , I was an as  --  sistant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the New York Of  --  fice of Postal Censorship , looking for secret messages in correspondence , with a hundred or more people working under me . After the war , I was twice offered cryptanalytical jobs in top-secret government agencies , but by then I had had my fill of that kind of work . " In 1957 , my husband and I were living in --  Wait a second . Oh , San Antonio , Texas . We 'd been there since 1950 . ' The $64,000 Challenge ' was then having its vogue on television , and when I heard that a friend of mine in Pennsylvania had got on the show , I decided to try out for it myself . With  --  out having to cheat or anything , I got as far as the eight-thousand-going-for  --  sixteen bracket , but then I stumbled over the meaning of the word rescis  --  sible . ' I did n't much mind . I had earned four free round trips between Texas and New York . By then , too , I was deeply interested in James Joyce . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ controversial . For a long time , I read ' Ulysses ' the way some people read the Bible  --  cover to cover , every year or eighteen months . When Finnegans Wake ' came out , I re  --  jected it outright , but then read it through twice , with no recourse to commentaries , and no understanding of it . Finally , I gave in and got Campbell and Robinson 's ' Skeleton Key , ' which gave me some comprehension of the language . But as I got closer and closer to the hook , I began to ques  --  tion some of the assumptions in the Key . ' There is obviously a connec  --  tion between my interest in crosswords and cryptography and my fascination with Joyce . When you 're solving puz  --  zles , you let your mind float with re  --  spect to words . It 's very Freudian , dealing with puns and tricky word as  --  sociations , and you almost have to know several languages . In that re  --  spect , Joyce was incomparable . He probably has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tinnegans Wake ' that nobody has discovered yet , but do n't fool yourself  --  somebody someday will come up with a list of them . " I 'm in correspondence with a lot of people about Joyce all the time , and I 've made the usual pilgrimages to Dublin and his other haunts . I 've just returned from a non-Joycean trip to Europe . My travel agent got me in with an expedition of the Society for the Preservation of Archaeological An  --  tiquities , which is not normally my sphere of interest . There were twelve of us on the tour . I had a little Kodak , and they must have had fifteen thou  --  sand dollars ' worth of camera equip  --  ment among them . A couple of them never seemed to look at anything ex  --  cept through a viewfinder . I could n't wait to get back to Joyce . I have an unfinished hook about him that I 'm working on , and I have written about him for , among other publications , the James Joyce Review , the James @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago , the very first issue of Modern British Literature was kind enough to make my ' The Last Word in Stolentelling ' its leading article  --  that was an analysis of the various in  --  fluences in ' A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man . ' In the editor 's biog  --  raphies of his contributors , not having any academic credentials he could as  --  sign to me , he rather flatteringly re  --  ferred to me as the ' retired undefeated crossword-puzzle champion of the world , ' which was a surprise to me but sounded nice . " We asked Mrs. von Phil to tell us her agenda for the future . " At my age , one does n't make many long-range plans , " she said , " but I hope to write some more about Joyce and , for the short term , to spend Christmas in California with my great-grandchild . " Walkers THIS year , for the first time , the sponsors of the New York City Marathon admitted a group of en  --  trants whose aim was to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whom are prospects for the United States Olympic team  --  covered the Marathon course in what one of their leaders called a " race within a race , " with several of the walkers finishing in better times than those of many of the runners . ( The winning race walker , Carl Sch uc I er , of Washington , D.C. , finished in three hours forty-seven minutes and thirty-nine seconds  --  a time that put him ahead of about six thou  --  sand of the more than eleven thousand runners who participated . ) Race walk  --  ing is a very old activity  --  some his  --  torians have traced it to medieval En  --  gland  --  and it has been an Olympic sport since 1908 , the walkers usually competing at distances of ten , twenty , and fifty kilometres . The sport has gone in and out of vogue several times dur  --  ing this century ; one of its halcyon phases came during the nineteen-twen  --  ties , when six-day walking races used to be held in Madison Square Garden . There was a decline of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then , in the sixties  --  soon after joggers began to appear con  --  spicuously on the nation 's streets and sidewalks  --  race walking began to catch on again . Last April , some people who are convinced of the pleasures and henefits of walking founded the New York Walkers Club . The president of the new club is a forty-nine-year-old gar  --  ment-center executive named Howard Jacobson , who now devotes much of his time to coaching walkers and run  --  ners . Each Saturday morning , weath  --  er permitting , either Jacobson or one of his assistants holds free " race-walk ing-for-fitness clinics " in Central Park . The other Saturday morning , we went up to the Park 's entrance at Fifth Avenue and Ninetieth Street to observe one of the clinics . It was a brisk and invigorating sort of day . The sky was clear , the temperature was in the fifties , and the leaves on the Park 's London plane trees shivered in a light wind . When we arrived , about fifty people were doing warmup exercises under Jacobson 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a brown beard , and he was wearing blue trunks , sockless training shoes , and a white T-shirt that bore the inscription " IAAF Welt Cup Gchen 1979 Lugano Tro  --  phy Eschborn , " which referred to a re  --  cent race-walking competition in Ger  --  many in which he had participated as a coach . The people appeared to range in age from their teens to their seventies or eighties , and when they had finished their exercises Jacobson said to them , " With the beginners , I 've been no  --  ticing a number of faults in your walk  --  ing . If you focus on your arms , you forget about your legs , or else you for  --  get about foot-strike . I want to stress to you that fluidity is important . When we walk , we must achieve propulsion with our legs . I still see some of you  --  your arms are drifting . You must feel the fluidity of it , must feel the syn  --  chronization , no matter what the tem  --  po . Some of you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still walking as you would if von were just walking along the street . What is race walking ? Race walking is an efficient method of walk ? ing quickly . You do n't have to race to race walk , you know . You can race walk simply in order to improve your stamina , your physical development , and your general health . The first thing to remember is to keep your arms at about a ninety-degree angle . They should be close to your body but not rigid . When you reach out with the left foot , the right arm swings For  --  ward , and vice versa . You must feel the heel-plant , feel the pushoff . " Soon Jacobson organized the par  --  ticipants into four groups , according to their levels of endurance , and sent them off on walks of varying lengths along the Park 's East Drive . He joined a group that was going to race walk for about a mile , and we set nut  --  walking in an ordinary manner -- beside him . As we walked , keeping up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walkers consider their sport to be more beneficial to the heart and lungs , more conducive to balanced muscular development , and far less injury-in  --  ducing than running . " Walkers get along fine with runners , but the two groups do have differences of opinion , " he said . " And there is a certain amount of crossover . Some runners have taken up race walking , and some race walkers also rim . In fact , the New York Road Runners Club cooperated with our club in arranging for race walkers to be ad  --  mitted to the Marathon this year . Race walking can definitely improve a person 's running skills , because race walkers pay more attention to efficiency and alignment . I started out as a run  --  ner myself  --  I was a scholastic and col NOVEMDER , 1979 legiate distance runner  --  but twenty-three years ago I decided to take up race walking . As soon as I tried it , I had a feeling of power and strength that I had never experienced before . For one thing , your arms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upper bodies much more than runners do . We also develop fantastic endurance . And race walkers get very few injuries . You may have noticed that the runners you know always seem to be in the pro  --  cess of recuperating . That 's because running involves a great deal of shock impact  --  with each step forward , a run  --  ner sends a shock through his body that amounts to a force of from three and a half to four times his body weight . Those shocks are the reason for a lot of runners ' injuries . In contrast , race walking is a smooth and efficient trans  --  fer of body weight , without all that pounding . Sometimes race walkers have been laughed at and called ' wigglers , ' because of the way some walkers appear to wiggle their hips . But an accom  --  plished race walker is not a wiggler at all . Recently , a lot of people have be  --  gun to realize what race walking is all about . Here in the Park , runners and bicyclists give us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things like ' Yea , race walker ! ' and ' Go , race walker ! ' We 're getting more notice and more acceptance all the time . " When all the walkers had returned to the starting point , we spoke with several of them , including a woman named Sally Stewart , who told us that she was the director of health and physical education at the McBurney Y.M.C.A. , and that the Y had re  --  cently incorporated race walking into its cardiovascular-fitness program . We also spoke with a white-haired woman in a magenta sweater , who told us that her name was Miss Gwendolyn Clark , that she was a retired nurse , and that she was eighty-seven years old . " That man has helped me tremendously since I started , " she said , indicating Jacob  --  son . " My coordination and my posture were terrible when I took up walling , a few months ago . Now they 've im  --  proved tremendously . I 'm out here al  --  most every morning . I feel wonderful . I walk six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Pepsi- Cola in honor of the Parks De  --  partment 's urban park rangers : " This bread is the wrong color , " said the man in the gray herringbone suit . " The bread is the wrong color , " THE NEW YORKER said the pretty girl in the gray cash mere sweater , rolling a piece of crisp brown bread around in her hand . " What color should the bread be ? " asked a girl who was dressed in the uni  --  form of a forest ranger and who had red hair and freckles . " Ah ha ha , ah ha ha ha , ah ha ha ha ha , " laughed the man and the pretty girl , falling into each other 's laps . " It 's always nice to have a forest ranger seated next to you at lunch , " said the man , winking at the girl in the ranger uniform . " Oh , but I am not a real forest ranger , " said the girl wearing the ranger uni  --  form . " I am a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ er .

Snakes , losers , and wild burros  --  that 's all that 's there . " " Forty thousand dollars a year ... off your income .. kind of hard to make do you know what , " said the man .

" I was trying to see if everybody got the same thing , " answered the girl . " Everybody got the same thing , " said the man . " Bay scallops in a floury sauce on a French-type piecrust , beans , and potatoes in a floury sauce . " " Scallops are high in protein , " said the pretty girl . " Look , " said the girl wearing the ranger uniform , " Someone is approach  --  ing the microphone . " " Our many distinguished guests , " said the man at the microphone .

ATUESDAY lunch given by the Skoal tobacco company ( makers of snuff ) to honor the country singer Charlie Daniels : " So many of the men in this room are losing the hair on their heads , " said the pretty girl .

' It 's just the kind of thing she would know , " said the pretty girl . " That waiter comes from Albania . He told me .

" Just before I go to lunch , I think , What fun this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are in school , though not as much fun as a day at the beach , " said the pretty girl . " This is as much fun as I thought it would he , " said her companion .
