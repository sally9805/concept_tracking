There have been more than 500 political assassinations in the past twelve months alone , and inflation is currently running at an annual rate of 80% in Argentina , a country that is approaching the edge of chaos . Isabel Pern , who succeeded her husband as President after his death last July , has been unable to reverse two disastrous trends : the terrorist campaign of kidnaping and murder being waged by rival extremist groups of both the left and the right , and the steady collapse of what was once Latin America ' s most prosperous economy . Last week TIME Buenos Aires Correspondent Rudolf Rauch sent this report : <P> Recklessness with money is a constant that runs through the 30-year history of Peronism . During his first years as President , Juan Pern depleted Argentina 's once rich treasury to gain support among the legions of descamisados ( the shirtless ones ) , who soon came to expect generous social-welfare spending by the government . Now that tradition of bounty has come to a screeching halt and with it , in the opinion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ served with el Lder in the years of glory . Taking their place are officials loyal to Argentina 's Minister of Social Welfare Jos Lpez Rega , the shadowy confidant of Mrs. Pern . A former astrologer , Lpez Rega is widely regarded as the country 's most powerful figure . He has presided over a drastic turn toward economic austerity that has enraged millions of Argentines . As one Buenos Aires columnist put it , " Peronism has yielded to Lpez Regaism . " <P> The passage of power was signaled two weeks ago by the departure of Economy Minister Alfredo Gmez Morales , who alienated workers by refusing to go along with union demands for wage increases , amounting in some cases to 150% . Seeing an opportunity to gain influence in another key ministry , Lpez Rega apparently prevailed upon Mrs. Pern to accept Gmez Morales ' resignation . His replacement was a little-known industrial engineer , Celestino Rodrigo , 60 , who had previously served as Secretary in Lpez Rega 's Social Welfare Ministry . <P> Drastic Step . Rodrigo rode to his swearing-in ceremony on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last popular thing he did . Two days after taking office , he devalued the peso from 15 to the U.S. dollar to 30 . He also took a drastic step to solve one of the country 's basic economic problems : prices , controlled by the Peronists as a populist measure , had fallen so far behind wages that production was lagging . Rodrigo announced price hikes in essential goods that quickly blossomed into across-the-board increases ( see chart ) . On the first day of the new prices , many small stores simply closed their doors while owners put new price tags on merchandise already on hand and frantically called suppliers to find out how much it would cost to restock their shelves .
