Who Conceded What to Whom How Carter and Co. negotiated the strategic arms treaty <P> Last week 's announcement of agreement on a SALT II treaty between the U.S. and the Soviet Union capped 6 years of negotiations . Jimmy Carter and Leonid Brezhnev hope that when they sign the treaty next month , they will be keeping alive a process that began with SALT I a dozen years ago and will continue-in SALT III , IV and V-for decades to come . The Strategic Arms Limitation Talks have been called the most important negotiations of the postwar era . But whether SALT II ever becomes the law of the land , indeed whether the SALT process is to continue , depends on the U.S. Senate , which must ratify the treaty by a two-thirds majority . The debate in the Senate over ratification will cover a range of questions , including one of history : Who conceded what to whom in exchange for what in the course of the negotiations ? Attention has already begun to focus on the confused but climactic phase of SALT II , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's announcement . Believing that one way to grasp SALT is to understand its evolution , TIME Diplomatic Correspondent Strobe Talbott has spent much of the past year reconstructing the Administration 's conduct of SALT , based on exclusive interviews with key officials . His report : <P> Jimmy Carter had just been elected President , and the Kremlin was nervous . After eight years of dealing productively with Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford , the Soviets found themselves confronted in January 1977 with a largely unknown quantity . Would this new American Administration finish the work on a Strategic Arms Limitation treaty begun by Nixon and continued by Ford ? The SALT I interim agreement limiting strategic offensive arms , signed by Nixon and Brezhnev in 1972 , was due to expire in October 1977 . Brezhnev and Ford had agreed at Vladivostok in 1974 on the framework of a new treaty to run until 1985 : each side would be allowed 2,400 strategic , or intercontinental-range , weapons , 1,320 of which could have MIRVs . In January 1976 , Brezhnev and Henry Kissinger had nearly reached an understanding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weapons , the Soviet Backfire bomber and the U.S. cruise missile , which had not been defined at Vladivostok . But by then detente , SALT and Kissinger himself had come under attack from presidential candidates in both parties , including Democratic Dark Horse Jimmy Carter . <P> After the Inauguration , Carter ordered the National Security Council to prepare for renewed strategic arms talks between Secretary of State Cyrus Vance and Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko . The NSC drafted Presidential Review Memorandum No. 2 , an interagency study of the options available to the President . There was a loose consensus that the U.S. should seal the deal Gerald Ford had made at Vladivostok , and swiftly . Then the Administration could get on with more ambitious initiatives in the next round of talks , SALT III . <P> However , Defense Secretary Harold Brown , National Security Adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski , his deputy , David Aaron , and Carter himself were all dissatisfied with the Vladivostok accord . Its subceiling of 1,320 multiple-warhead launchers allowed the two sides " freedom to mix " land-based and submarine-launched MlRVed missiles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where
