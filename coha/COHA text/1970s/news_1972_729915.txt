txt " We 're suddenly rich , but we do n't know who gets what , " quips a policeman here . The riches are some $20 million in federal money just promised to St. Louis and seven other American cities over the next two years , in a sudden Nixon administration move against crime in the streets . The money will go for new policemen and new equipment in the cities , and for some , it could not have come at a better time . First , however , city officials are wrestling with the details amid some confusion . Says a spokesman here , " We did n't even find out we had been selected until about two **25;789;TOOLONG announced . " The long-term Nixon administration goal : to make a quick , high  --  impact drive against street crime ( robbery , muggings , assault , rape ) and burglaries , reducing both by 5 percent in two years and up to 20 percent in five -- years.  --  Eventually the program could be expanded to as many as ten more cities . Other questions St. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ percent in the past year . Significantly , the cities  --  Newark , Atlanta , Baltimore , Cleveland , Dallas , Denver , and Portland , Ore. , besides St. Louis  --  are to be given wide latitude in packaging their own programs to meet local needs . Among the preplexing questions for St. Louis officials ( and officials of other cities ) to untangle : ? ? What specific agency  --  the city , the police department , locally based federal officials  --  will receive the first $5 million during the next several months ? Nobody here is yet sure . ? How will allocation be weighed ? Should citizen groups in high crime areas participate in drawing up plans ? How can the program be insulated from politics ? ? Perhaps most important : What about the long-range implications of any newly devised program ? To add even 250 men to the St. Louis force , for example , would mean an additional $2.5 million annually in salaries . Will the community be able to maintain the higher level of funding after the federal grants expire ? // *St @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crime // Beyond salaries the force would have to muster cash for training equipment and overhead for any new staff recruitments . The program here will be hammered together by local officials , as well as by the Law Enforcement Assistance Administration ( LEAA ) of the U.S. Department of Justice , which is underwriting the national $160 million program . Cities ignored ? In the past some national critics of the LEAA have argued that high-crime areas of cities were ignored by state agencies , which were more preoccupied with rural programs . For St. Louis itself , whose 2,232 man police force is at full strength , the new money is expected to have far-reaching effects . The force , which is on a budget of $33 million annually , is expected to purchase more equipment , including two-way land radios , as-well as-expand the force by hiring additional men . To do that , however , would require lifting legal limits on the size of the force . Even before the grant was announced last week the local police board had already introduced bills at the Legislature at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Favorable action is expected this winter . The Police Board has talked about adding 250 more men to the force . Mayor Alfonso J. Cervantes has broached the possibility of adding 500 men . Overtime utilized In the meantime the force will likely use truant officers on an overtime basis , a tactic successfully adopted in a number of cities . In financially troubled Cleveland , Mayor Ralph J. Perk indicates he will seek to bolster specialized anticrime units such as the detective and narcotics units , as well as to restore 66 officers laid off in a budget crunch last year . The department is also contemplating strengthening its well-known mounted units in the downtown area . According to Chief of Police Gerald Rademaker , the force will also make major equipment purchases . For the Nixon administration the new " impact " program is seen as one more step in the anticrime program promised by Mr. Nixon during his 1968 campaign .

The administration has also been criticized by liberals for extending use of court-ordered wiretapping and supporting no-knock legislation and pretrial detention . Some critics have alleged that the administration is more concerned with the hardware and the technique of crime fighting than with alleviating the social roots of crime .
