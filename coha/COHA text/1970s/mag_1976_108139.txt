Never mind what you 've heard , the baseball season did not start last week in Cincinnati and Milwaukee . Far from it . They have been playing high-caliber baseball in Arizona for almost two months now . Granted it 's college ball , but if you do not think that is good or engrossing , you were not at Arizona State 's Packard Stadium in Tempe last Thursday . The very day those hold-out , locked-out big-leaguers finally were getting down to real work , the two best college teams , complete with the two best college players and the best college rivalry in the country , were starting a three-game series of their own . // The combatants were top-ranked Arizona State ( 38-7 ) and No. 2 Arizona ( 32-10 ) . Although the two had been playing games since mid-February , they had not yet faced each other . But their first series was worth waiting for . It marked the opening of the Western Athletic Conference schedule for both teams . In league play each game is critical , and that added extra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since ASU began playing varsity baseball in 1959. // " Arizona fans used to boo us when we got off the bus in Tucson , " says Fred Nelson , who played for the Sun Devils in the 1960s and now coaches Scottsdale Community College . " Once they let the air out of our tires . " Nelson was among a crowd of 7,850 that attended the series opener . That figure was about 550 below capacity at Packard Stadium , but many of the empty seats appeared to have come disguised as fans . Another spectator was a man whose indecision could figure heavily in the American League standings , Reggie Jackson of the Oakland Orioles . Jackson , an Arizona State alumnus , could not stay away , although he claimed , " Baseball is the farthest thing from my mind . " // He was entertained in spite of himself . The ASU starter was the country 's leading collegiate pitcher , lefthander Floyd Bannister , who came into the game with a 9-1 record , a 1.43 earned run average and an average of 14 strikeouts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ordinary for him , perhaps because he had been suffering from the flu for three days . Bannister gave up an unearned run in the first inning when Arizona State 's freshman shortstop , Bob Horner , booted his first chance ( this is no rivalry for rookies ) and a couple of Arizona players sandwiched hits around a walk to the best-hitting prospect on any campus , Wildcat Outfielder Dave Stegman . Stegman began the series with a .455 average that did not include a 5-for-5 performance in an exhibition game against the Oakland A's. // The game soon turned into a pitching duel between Bannister and Craig Gioia , who leads Arizona in wins ( 7 ) , ERA ( 2.10 ) , strikeouts ( 50 ) and vowels . The moment of highest drama arrived with one out in the sixth inning when the Sun Devils loaded the bases . To the plate came Third Baseman Brandt Humphry , a rangy , bespectacled sophomore who was originally considered a defensive specialist but had worked his way into the regular lineup by batting .367 . Gioia fooled him badly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3-2 , choked up on his bat and guessed slider . His premonition was correct , and he lined a single to center that scored one run and keyed the game-breaking rally that led to the Sun Devils ' 7-2 win . // The best late-inning viewing was in the stands , where the Hallmark Hecklers , a raucous group of Arizona State students , were holding forth . At one point Arizona blew a chance to get back in the game when Third-Base Coach Mark Johnson waved home a doomed runner . The Wildcat was tagged out , and the Hecklers chanted " M-I-C , K-E-Y , M-O-U-of-A . " One of them , graduate student Neil Koven , had news for those Arizonans who claim the Sun Devil-Wildcat rivalry has mellowed . " We hate those SOBs , " he said . " We built this field with private funds but the state built their field . The legislature is dominated by people from Tucson . " // After the game , the quiet , studious Bannister , dressed in sneakers , corduroy pants , a white T shirt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Big Boy hamburgers and a large milk . All that was missing was a slice of American pie . Bannister could be in a major league uniform before the end of the summer , and he had just shown that he has major league mettle with a 145-pitch complete game despite the lingering flu . " I just hope the pros do n't push me too fast , " he said . " I do n't want to blow my confidence . I hope they put me in Double A or wherever I really belong . " He probably belongs far higher than he thinks . // In the second game Arizona State trailed 9-4 going into the seventh . " Remember Tulsa ! " yelled the players , who were on their feet after the first two batters of the inning walked . ASU had trailed Tulsa 9-0 and rallied to win 14-9 , and now there was an air of inevitability in the Sun Devil dugout that a similar rally was in the works . Ricky Peters singled , Ken Landreaux doubled and suddenly Arizona 's lead was cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accurately figured at 8,338 , roared as designated hitter Clay Westlake forced in a run with an infield out , and Ken Phelps tied the score with a bloop hit . Then with runners on second and third , the redoubtable Humphry delivered again , driving in the go-ahead run with a single on the first pitch . By the time the inning was over , the Sun Devils had rallied for six runs on six hits . They went on to win 11-9 . " Fantastic does n't begin to describe it , " cheered ASU Coach Jim Brock , who had looked good himself by waving in Reliever Mitch Dean to snuff out a late Wildcat threat . // While the Sun Devils play with a late-inning explosiveness reminiscent of the Red Sox , they look more like the A 's  --  Sal Bando 's brother Chris is a reserve second baseman  --  and act more like the Reds . They use tobacco and snuff , chide each other and bait their foes . All the regulars are hitting better than .300 , and 10 or more of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ season ends in June . // After the second loss Arizona was understandably depressed , and that even included Stegman , though he had not been retired in 10 trips to the plate . He had doubled twice , walked seven times and been hit by a pitch . He looks like a right-hand-hitting Fred Lynn , complete with a prominent nose ( the State players call him Aardvark ) , an upright swing that consistently produces line drives , good eyes and exceptional range . In fact , he almost signed with the Red Sox after his junior year . // But instead of pointing to his impeccable record at the plate , Stegman drew attention to his lone mistake . He had been picked off first by ASU 's sturdy Catcher Gary Allenson , who on a subsequent play provoked an uncharacteristic display of anger from Stegman . Even though he did not have the ball , Allenson blocked the plate when Stegman was scoring . " Do n't ever do that , bleeper , " said Stegman , an honor student in engineering who is even straighter than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ players laughed in disbelief . It made their night . // On Saturday they made their weekend , beating Arizona a third time with another routine come-from-behind rally , this one for three runs in the eighth . Center-fielder Landreaux , just a fraction less touted than Stegman , drove in the winning run , and Bannister got his 11th victory in relief . // " A few hits one way or another and it could have been different , " said Stegman . Arizona  --  and its no less raucous fans  --  will have a chance to prove it during a three-game series in Tucson next month . Then , thanks to the NCAA 's wild-card format , the archrivals could meet again in the College World Series . That makes perfect sense , because this is one intra-state rivalry that should be enjoyed by the whole nation .
