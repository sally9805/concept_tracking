There was one interesting question to be considered in Boston last week in the Spingold Knockout Team Championship : How good are the world champion Dallas Aces ? True , the Aces had won the world title at Stockholm in June easily , but the competition , said detractors , was lackluster . Were the Aces really worthy champions ? Well , the Aces did not win the Spingold , but by getting to the finals after beating some of the top bridge teams in the country , they demonstrated again that they are certainly among the best in the world . // Strangely enough , the finals of the Spingold turned out to be almost a replay of Stockholm , for once again the Aces found themselves up against the Chinese system  --  that is , the Precision Club created by C. C. Wei , an oil tanker magnate whose ideas and training methods brought lightly held Chinese teams to the world championship runner-up spot the last two years . This time , though , the Precision Club was wielded with surprising effectiveness by a young American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Peter Weichsel of New York City , Tom Smith of Greenwich , Conn. and Dave Strasberg of Rockville Centre , N.Y. , which defeated the Aces by 59 international match points . // In the finals the Precision Club had to beat off the Orange Club , an adaptation of various Italian systems that is used by Jim Jacoby and Bobby Wolff . The Wei bidding method is a more natural system by standard American concepts  --  once you pass the foundation stone of an artificial one-club opening on a minimum of 16 high-card points and a one-diamond response with fewer than eight . But on this key hand both systems led to an unmakable three-no-trump contract , and it was left to the individual brilliance of Peter Weichsel , who played impressively throughout , to provide the big difference in the result . // In the other room the same contract was reached by the Precision team after South opened with a weak one no trump ( 13 to 15 points ) , and declarer went down one rather gracefully following a club opening lead and a diamond shift . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somewhat differently . He too led a club , but when Smith won the king and returned a club , the queen losing to Weichsel 's ace , the defense was in a precarious position . Weichsel recognized the danger of leaving the queen of hearts as a potential entry to the spade suit , and made a fine shift to a low heart , even though this meant violation of the bridge commandment " never lead away from a king . " Without the heart shift , Jacoby would have had time to knock out the ace of spades and later get to dummy with the heart queen to make his contract . All the defenders would get would be a heart , a spade and two clubs . // After the heart shift , however , Jacoby had no chance . As it turned out , he would have fared a bit better if he had guessed to put up dummy 's queen , but instead he played dummy 's 10 and East 's jack forced the ace . Jacoby then led the spade 10 and overtook with dummy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trick , but allowing for the chance to take the diamond finesse if East ducked , which he did . But the diamond finesse lost and Weichsel got out with a spade to East 's ace . East returned a diamond and South led a low heart . Weichsel took his king and got out with a diamond . Declarer cashed his heart 9 and led his last heart , hoping to end play West in clubs . But East won the trick with the 7 and cashed two good diamonds to set the contract four tricks for a net gain of 300 points . This was worth seven IMPs as compared to a possible loss of 12 if Weichsel had not shifted to hearts .
