When the cops came they found the judge had planted evidence <P> As any follower of police fiction knows well , it does not always pay to call the cops . Paul N. Halvonik , 40 , a California Courts of Appeal justice , and his lawyer wife Deborah , 37 , apparently do not read police fiction . Returning to their home in Oakland Hills early one evening , Mrs. Halvonik found that a burglar had stolen $1,450 worth of television and video-tape equipment . She called the cops . The Oakland P.D. , in the person of Patrolman Monte Beers , responded in short order . While checking out the perpetrator 's point of entry , Officer Beers later reported , he spotted some long-leafed plants growing in redwood boxes on the balcony in the rear of the house . They were not zinnias . To Officer Beers ' trained eye they looked like Cannabis saliva , a.k.a. marijuana . <P> Two days later , a pair of Oakland P.D . vice-squad officers parked around the corner from the Halvoniks ' house and deployed a Bushnell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magnify up to 45 times beyond the capability of the naked eye . Sure enough , the plants on the balcony were pot . A few hours later , armed with a search warrant , the seeing-eye detectives returned and counted 323 marijuana plants growing around the house . Inside , they found two lids of smokable grass and almost half an ounce of cocaine . <P> The couple were charged with cultivation of marijuana , a felony , and with possession , a misdemeanor . Because the coke was discovered in her desk , Mrs. Halvonik was also charged with possession of cocaine , a felony . Since Halvonik is a judge and his wife a lawyer , they were spared the humiliation of booking , fingerprinting and mug-shooting ; free without bail on their own recognizance , they face trial . <P> Paul Halvonik , who had a respected record as an American Civil Liberties Union counsel before his judicial appointment , is a longtime friend and former aide to Governor Edmund G. Brown Jr. , who named him to the bench in 1978 . Previously he had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attorney general . Fellow jurists who know his work have nothing but praise for him . Says San Francisco County Superior Court Judge Harry W. Low , until recently president of the California Judges ' Association : " He 's got an excellent legal mind and a good sense of being able to relate to people . " Adds Lawyer James J. Brosnahan , an ex-president of the San Francisco Bar Association : " His opinions showed a sensitivity for civil liberties and a deep knowledge of constitutional law . He was a young man with a bright future . " Obviously , whatever the outcome of the case against him , Halvonik 's public career may be ruined ( though the publicity might not harm his future as a private advocate in California ) .
