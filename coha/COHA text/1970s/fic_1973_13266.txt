She unpacks a picnic , indentifiable because of the red-checked tablecloth she spreads on the floor . She turns on her boom box so it plays an amateur heavy metal tape , the lyrics in French , and she sings along as she sets out two paper plates , two plastic forks , two plastic knives and so on . This might take some time , since all this stuff is brand new and has to be taken from its plastic wrapper . The menu also includes a six-pack of Bras d'or , a baguette and Chinese food . The last thing ROSIE does is place a pill bottle in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last thing is her little Quebec flag . Which she sticks in the middle of the pill bottle . The telephone rings .
