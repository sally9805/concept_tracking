A story by Gail Godwin NOBODY 'S HOME MARRIEDWOMAN , Mrs. Wakeley , alone with her thoughts all day , watches a building rise out of the ground , across the street from her house . She becomes involved with this building and its progress . It seems to be telling her something . At last it is finished . The plaque goes up , very tastefully , on the right side of the entrance . NOW RENTING : ONE- , TWO- , AND THREE-BEDROOM APARTMENTS . INQUIRE AT OFFICE INSIDE . With the top part of the new bifocals she hates , she can read the gold letters on the black background quite easily from her own bedroom window , and suddenly the building 's message flashes out at her ! She is going to go and live there , make all the arrangements without telling her husband , then simply leave one day . When he comes home , she will not be there , and he will not know why . She will be across the street , watching to see what happens without her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person ( but she always dresses carefully , she has always been a responsible person ) and leaves the house by the hack door , walking quickly down the alley . She wears a fitted black coat with a fur collar , dark stockings , and plain black pumps with sensible heels . She is a short woman . full-fleshed but compact . As a girl she was called " petite . " Within a few months of letting herself go , she would now be called " plump . " She has dreamy gray-green eyes and very white , lustrous skin , exactly the same color all over , as she has been allergic to sun , even in small amounts , all her life . She wears her hair the way she has worn it for years : parted down the middle and fastened into a bun low on the back of her neck , where a few strands have already drifted down onto the fur collar . The hairs which have lost their pigment glisten brightly against the dark ones which have n't . " I am on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart beating like a criminal 's , this woman halfway between youth and age , holding her purse close to her , a woman not usually met with in alleyways . And so , by a circuitous route , she enters the new building and goes to the manager 's office . He rises to greet her , recognizing respectability at once , probably a widow , he is already thinking , there is something about her face that shows she has lost a man : there is no doubt in his mind that she had one , for she is still an attractive woman , and there , of course , is the ring . This is all very lucky for " Mrs. Jones , " now shaking hands with Mr. Frascati , as she has de-cided to pose as a widow . At first she played with the idea of being a single woman , " Clara J o n es " but , upon testily removing her ring , Mrs. Wakeley saw that its twenty-eight years on her finger had left an indentation so deep it was suspicious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has brought weight and substance and authority . He is not much taller than herself . He wears a large diamond in his own wedding band , and his beautifully manicured nails sparkle with a very light pink varnish . Pictures of wife , children , grandchildren flank him on either side of his desk . I will have no children , decides Mrs. Wakeley , keeping it simple , as Mrs. Jones is asking whether she might be shown one of the one-bedroom apartments . Too late she remembers she should have specified one which faced the street , just as Mr. Frascati is accompanying her into a lovely sun-filled room with new wood floors whose beams rush toward the windows as if toward the light . He points out with pride the small area below which will be a private garden , accessible to tenants only , and where , as soon as things are organized , there will be flowers and shrubs year round . " More privacy back here , " he is saying . " The view of a garden in the city is a rare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the front , with the noise and the ugly streets . " Mrs. Wakeley , delicately rcpinning a runaway piece of hair back into the secure loop of her bun , takes courage and says , " But ... if you do n't mind ... I think I 'd rather face the street . I like noise . I like the ... distraction , you see . " And remembers to glance poignantly at her ring . The good man understands . He shows her the same apartment , facing in the other direction . Mrs. Wakeley stands at this window into which no sun shines at this time of day and looks down at her own front door . It looks small and impersonal from this angle , not much different from the other doors on either side of it . She is eye-level with her bedroom and bathroom on that other second floor . Ali , " Clara Jones " the single woman would have liked the bright apartment better , with her back turned to this street , with the sky streaming through , bringing an unpredictable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quiet garden of repose , where one could cultivate new thoughts and grow one knew not what . But " Mrs. Jones " has certain unfinished business , and as she asks the proper questions about rents and leases and fixtures and utilities she is focusing on her own front door and imagining that first scene like the opening shot of a him . Her husband is coining down the street from his bus , carrying his briefcase . As he approaches the door his pace ? quickens ? lags ? She has never seen her husband approaching the house in which she waits . Only , of course , now she will not be inside ! But he does n't know that yet . She is no longer an actress , sealed into her part , but an anonymous " audience " who watches calmly from a distance , waiting to see what happens next . M R. FRASCATI mistakes the flush of triumph on her face for an indication that he has rented another apartment . Having taken an interest in the predicament of this modest woman ( the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his masculine soul ) he is somewhat disappointed he could n't persuade her away from this gloomy view , the kind he has been trying to escape all his life . He can not understand people who can resist a garden ; but then , women have their own reasons for things . He is happy to inform her that this apartment will be ready for occupancy within two weeks , as soon as the electricians finish some wiring . She asks may she let him know in a few days . Of course ( giving her his card , " Emilio Antonio Frascati , Manager " ) , that will be fine , he would not want her to make such an important decision without first satisfying herself as to the optimum ... He is already feeling protective toward this little woman with the fragile white skin , and he stands behind the curtain of his own office and watches her leave the building . Mrs. Wakeley , amazingly adept for one so new to subterfuge , walks away , down the street , giving her house not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daylight browsing in a library . She reads how " all marriages are power games , " in a new book called The Integrity of Divorce , " and when one partner becomes permanent winner or loser , then that marriage can he said to be over , even though the couple continue to live together . " She is instructed how to " cut her meat costs to the bone " by preparing stuffed Mediterranean veal breast with prune dumplings , Korean spareribs with soy and sesame sauce ( at which point she snaps open her purse , takes out a silver pencil and a memo pad , then remembers something and puts them back at once ) . She reads a letter in the same magazine from a woman who is angry because her husband has left her for a younger woman . " And what do I have to show for it ? Memories of years and years of housework ? What do I have left of my own ? It should be a law in this exam-try that before any woman gets a marriage license she should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A fixed amount would have to be put into this fund annually . But it must be the law so that people wo n't feel guilty about doing it . It would be a relief to young housewives who do n't dare mention such matters for fear of casting a shadow on things . Then , when she wears out , and her husband trades her in for a new model , she will have her own pension fund which would support her till she trained herself to work . " She reads that the new fashion trend is " romantic long dresses with designed-in nostalgia , " and sits gazing at two full-color pages of young models in their early twenties , wearing lawn-party dresses of their great-grandmothers ' vintage . She still can not get used to her new glasses . If she looks through the bottoms , she falls up the stairs ; if she reads through the tops , everything blurs . What do all these untried wisps of girls in their quaint costumes have to do with her ? How , for that matter , will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life ? Rather miffed at herself for wasting precious time escaping into magazines when she should have been planning her move , she puts on her coat and heads out into the dusk with a weary heart ( stopping at a grocer 's to buy artichokes , which her husband likes , in order to make up for the canned corned beef she 's going to dish up at the last minute , and it is at precisely this moment , alone on the dark , cold street , that her courage begins to falter . rr BEGIN WITH : the money . Mrs. Wakeley land her husband have a joint bank account , both in checking and savings . In the checking ( she ought to know , she does all the household accounts ) there is $560 . In savings there is $5,030 , plus whatever interest has been earned since the last quarterly payment . She could , she supposes , with impunity ( remembering the angry letter from the woman in the magazine ) go down to the bank and withdraw exactly half of both accounts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with graying hair , wearing a forgettable black coat , and open another account under the name of Mrs. Jones . Mrs. Clara Jones ? But do you need identification to open a hank account ? She might get a driver 's license for Clara Jones , except that she does n't drive . A Social Security card ! But how does one go about getting a Social Security card ? At her age , she does n't even know . Every one of those young models posing in old-fashioned dresses for a magazine has been carrying around a Social Security card for years ! She imagines some bullying woman booming accusingly across the desk at the Social Security office ( Where was it ? At the post office , perhaps ? ) : " Where have you been all these years ? Why have you waited so long ? " And even if Clara Jones obtains a Social Security card to prove she has the right to open a bank account in order to write Mr. Frascati a check for the first two months ' rent ( Oh , God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said , " but in these days ... disregard for private property ... yours will certainly be refunded in its entirety when you leave . " ) But she has n't even arrived yet ! The rent on that little apartment ( Oh , how is she going to furnish it ? She will have to select the furniture and have it sent , waiting for it furtively upstairs , for what if her husband saw her clown there on the sidewalk , waving her arms at moving men ? ) is $250 . Two times $250 plus $200 more is $700 ? and that includes neither utilities nor the bare essentials of furniture ( kitchen utensils , she suddenly remembers , would it be fair to take a few things from her own kitchen , packing them up secretly a few days before ? ) . And , lost in calculations , Mrs. Wakeley uses her own front door by mistake , even if it is dark and Mr. Frascati surely settling down in the bosom of his family in another part of town . She glances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the ground floor of the building is innocently dark . On the upper floors are several lighted windows , early tenants already moving in  --  her future neighbors ? But she will have to keep remote from neighbors , wo n't she , with her secret ? She imagines herself being invited to supper by a young couple in the building ( Why a young couple ? Why not a lonely , middle-aged woman without a man , like herself ? ) and how , grown carelessly boastful with wine and abundant spaghetti , she will tell those two young , idealistic lovers , " You know , my husband lives just across the street . He has no idea where 1 am , no idea in the world , but I can see him brushing his teeth if I want ! " Boiling the water for the artichokes , she subtracts her initial payment to Mr. Frascati from her " account , " and realizes that will leave her with exactly eight more months ' rent  --  without utilities , furnishings , or food . Well , she will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to get a job . Mrs. Wakeley imagines " jobs . " She sees women 's fingers galloping over the keyboards of huge electric machines ; women in white uniforms : women in black dresses behind counters ; the woman behind the desk in the library ; the woman behind the desk in the Social Security office , screaming , " Where have you been all these years ? " And now she sees the bank manager in the bank where Mrs. Clara Jones will open her account . A kindly man with steel-rimmed glasses , pictures of family on his desk as on Mr. Frascati 's , he is asking her gently , in a tone of mild disbelief , " But Mrs. Jones , do you mean to say that you have never had a previous account with any bank ? But surelyyour husband , then  --  could you perhaps give us the name of his bank ? " A terrible thought begins to form in her head : behind every real person in the real world there is a Social Security number and a bank account . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no Social Security number and only half a bank account . That makes her exactly one-fourth of a person . Was it this one-fourth who made the plan of moving across the street ? How could a fraction of a person live any-where by herself ? Was her plan just a fantasy , then , one of those daytime fantasies of a lonely wife ? Suddenly she sees herself no longer worthy of her own life story with a name of her own . She could accomplish the purposes of her fantasy within the confines of a small , impersonal fable , the message of which is vastly more significant than the nameless woman who inhabits it . In fables , no cash or job is required . In fantasies you can fly now and never pay . " One day there was a wife , " thinks Mrs. Wake-ley ( opening a can of corned beef ) . One day there was a wife who absented herself from her home and , unbeknownst to her husband , went and lived across the street . The first thing he did was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The third was to find a replacement for her . The wife watched these things . When he called the police , she perspired with guilt . When he mourned her , she wept with him . When he replaced her , she burned from head to foot with the miserable triumph of self-vindication . In the kitchen hang three small framed watercolors . Seascapes of Okracoke , primitive , rather depressing pictures , signed " T. Roscoe . " An old uncle , now dead . But she remembers the old straw hat he wore in the sun and is sentimentally attached to the Okracoke which was a product of his eyes alone . When she and her husband purchased this house and were frantically trying to fill up so much space all at once by themselves , she said , laughing , " We could string out Uncle Roscoe 's pictures on that long wall in the living room . " " We could . . . " replied her husband , not meeting her eyes . When he came home soon after and found the pictures hanging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " This room will cheer him up a bit . " Should her fable go on ? The wife began watching her replacement . She saw her doing many of the things that she had done . And some she had not . She even saw her start making some of her old mistakes . One day , when she could bear it no longer , she sat down and wrote her replacement an anonymous letter explaining certain things . When she hears the familiar turn of the key in the lock ( the artichokes bubbling away , the corned beef simmering with two poached eggs on Lop ) Mrs. Wakeley imagines that future evening , when this house will be dark . ( Or should she leave a light on ? ) No favorite smells or bubbling sounds will come from the kitchen . The cheerful walls will be somehow different , though it will take him a minute to figure out why . She has decided to take her uncle 's pictures with her . NYBODY HOME ? " her husband calls , as he has called for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different houses , when he always knew there would be someone home , then two people home , then three , then two again , then the one who 'd been there all the time , right from the beginning , the one who always answered , just for a joke : " No , nobody 's home . " " No , nobody 's home , " she calls . In the split second before he enters the kitchen , she resolves to keep her distance , to remove herself from her own involvement in this familiar scene , and take the first step toward her move across the street . She will become an observer as she watches him now , coming through this door , the " husband " of a " wife , " perform . ing , as he has for almost three decades , the ritual of " coming home . " But soon she discovers more difficulties than she had ever anticipated . In the first place , she finds that his presence works a subtle change in her . As she sits across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own otherness , she is no longer quite the woman who watched that new apartment building rise before her eyes like a vision , growing taller every day . She is no longer exactly the woman who saw a way out of a dilemma and went so far as to cross the normal borders of her life to explore it further . She ca n't even articulate what it is that the flesh-and-blood reality of her husband , as he sits with his napkin flung across his lap and his toes pointed slightly outward beneath the table , dipping an artichoke leaf into a pool of lemon butter , does to her own flesh and spirit . All she knows is that a verticalness seems to go out of her , and that , as she leans forward , toward her husband across the table , the molecules of her body seem to rearrange themselves in smaller , rounder patterns , homing in on themselves , retreating from long and difficult flights . The second thing is : she discovers that she can not see the totality of her husband @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who he is in relation to her . She ca n't grasp him in ( pick totality , as she could Mr. Frascati , or even the kindly but disbelieving bank manager , or even the young couple who invited Mrs. Clara Jones to share their spaghetti supper . Yes , it was truewhat she told them ( reckless from too much wine ) : she can see her husband brushing his teeth ! Without ever looking , she can picture the gold crowns in his mouth and the root canals he 's suffered through and the secret bridge which mortified him for the first whole year and the gum bleeds he gets sometimes in the night , and his touching vanity when he says , " Well , at least I 've kept all my hair ! " But what she ca n't see anymore is ' Wakeley , " " that man , " that stranger as seen from behind , or across the street . She can imagine Frascati , the exact smile he would have for his grandchild , his mistress , his bank manager , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she has lost the power to create her husband 's life , intuitively , with the sure hand of intuition , when he walks out of this house and becomes " just himself , " alone . And she knows he has also lost this power with her . She has not felt for some time that priceless tug that signals to her in his absence that she is securely attached to the strings of his imagination , that he is imagining her , not merely remembering her . And when they are together , he does not " see " her . He , too , sees only details . ( She wonders which details . Her new glasses which , even though she tried on every pair of frames in the shop , make her face look crooked and her eyes too critical ? Her apron ? Her gray hairs ? Her teeth ? ) Is that what marriage is , after all : details ? The gradual accumulation of details blocking up the person you once mysteriously loved , until that person can no longer be seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself and somebody called Tyson and somebody else called Wingate . It all sounds very innocuous , the kind of associations anybody might have with anybody during the course of a working day . But behind Tyson Mrs. Wakeley sees the poor shadow of a good-natured clown , habitually beset by mishaps , misunderstandings , who , by comparison , makes everyone else feel more sure of himself . ( " Poor guy . You know , I really like Tyson . " ) Whereas the mere utterance of the name Wingate , like an east wind , bodes no good . It is a name linked to villainous conspiracies and unjust accusations , a figure sporting years of unearned praise . ( " What I ca n't understand is , why ca n't intelligent people see through Wingate ? " ) She sees through Wingate very clearly , she sees all around Tyson , she sees the other characters and the props on that stage . She has even wondered what part " Wakeley " plays in the dinner conversations between Tyson and his wife and Wingate and his wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's easier view of Wakeley , Mrs. Wingate 's nutshell character sketch of him . She sees , sitting across the table from her , a man of forty-nine guiding the heart of an artichoke into his open mouth and lowering his eyes , which , nearsighted for years , are now restoring themselves toward perfect vision . She sees a person with a real job in the real world ; a man in a nice shirt she does n't remember having seen before , who perhaps takes a pretty young woman with a job for a " business lunch . " Dear Replacement the wife wrote , You think you know him . You do . Enjoy this knowledge . It passes . Memorize him . Be memorable yourself . " What did you do today ? " he asks , one of those rare spouses who helps clear the table without a fuss . He stacks the dishes beside the sink . He loads up his arms , like an agile waiter , with things to go back in the refrigerator . " I went to the library . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read , anything interesting ? " " A woman wrote in to a magazine that housewives ought to set up their own pension funds . The new fashions will have designed-in nostalgia . Do you think I ought to get a job ? " " Nostalgia is all over the place , " he remarks with interest , making himself the customary glass of ice water . " It 's the big supersell , nostalgia , everywhere you look . Why is that , I wonder ? Maybe because we do n't like where we are and do n't want to know where we 're going . " She recognizes the exact moment when his voice shifts from speculation to assertion . He is a person who can hear through the sound of his own voice the answers to things he thought he did n't know . " A job ? Why ? What kind ? " " I 'm not sure . But do n't you think everyone ought to do some kind of work before they die ? " " Die ? " He turns to touch her on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that ? " His ice cubes tinkle in his glass . " You have worked . You do work . if what you do is n't work , then who has worked ? If you mean a profession  --  would you like to go back to school ? We can afford it . I 've often thought ... " But she is thinking of the touch on her arm " her arm , " that detail on a totality he has not apprehended for so long a time . Does he still remember that her skin is exactly the same color all over ? There are certain questions people do not really want the answers to . They watch television . The first year they were married they could not stop watching each other long enough to go to the movies , which they both loved . Now Mrs. Wakeley watches as a hand lowers a fork into a pie and pulls out a string of pearls covered in blueberries , then slides the purplish mess into a glassful of effervescent denture cleanser . The pearls come out looking like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her husband turns to her , alarmed . She goes to the window to adjust the blinds for the night , and gazes through a chink across the dark street and up at certain unlighted windows . She stares through the top part of her glasses , trying to flush out from obscurity the outline of that other woman who can reveal to her who she is . Oh : how to make that leap to that other , higher window from which , at last , unencumbered by the motes of habit and the beams of affection , she can assess her position by spying on her own absence from it ! Will she be missed ? And how should her fable end , on a note of built-in nostalgia ? Memorize him the wife wrote . Or on a note of cynicism , based on one 's scant knowledge of the unhappy present : At first he trains his eyes on the shortsighted necessities of your mutual existence , leaving you free to focus mistily on your continuing happiness . Then one day the visions shift . You find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see him looking away . On a visionary note , perhaps ? One transcends this dilemma , of yes . Now that the banks are safely closed and that terrible Social Security woman double-locked with her pet dog in unlovely rooms , and Mr. Frascati , settling down with a saucerful of grapes , wearing carpet slippers whose insteps shine in the dark , perhaps to watch this same channel on TV with his wife , Mrs. Clara Jones waves the movers boldly on . In darkness they ascend the elevator in shifts , ghostly figures of men who do her bidding , bearing on their shoulders everything she will need to begin her new life . When they finish she gives each of them a handsome tip which costs her nothing . Days pass ... nights ... and , stationed at her window , scarcely bothering to eat or sleep , she stares down and across at where her marriage no longer is , until she understands it . And then what ? Will she turn her back on it forever and go to live in that other bright @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flowers watched by someone as self-sustaining as " Clara Jones " ? Or is that another story , perhaps not belonging to her at all ? " What are you looking at ? " asks her husband , who has been quietly watching her from behind . ?
