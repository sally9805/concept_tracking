As they have expanded round the world , U.S.-based multinational corporations have poured hundreds of millions of dollars into dozens of foreign countries . In some of these , outright bribery or thinly disguised payoffs to politicians are the accepted way of getting just about anything done-from obtaining routine licenses to killing unfavorable tax legislation . " There is no universal ethical absolute , " says Gulf Oil Corp . Chairman Bob Dorsey . " What is immoral to some is perfectly correct to others . " The willingness of American corporations to go along with this system has now exploded into a spreading scandal , and the bad publicity has embarrassed both the corporations and the governments involved . Last week came one of the more dramatic reactions . The government of Bolivia , demanding to know the names of all officials who had received $460,000 in political " contributions " from Gulf in the 1960s , jailed Gulfs only known employee in Bolivia , Carlos Dorado , and demanded that Gulfs Dorsey appear in a Bolivian court to answer charges of " crimes against public order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Bolivia could stop some $50 million in payments still owed to Gulf as a result of Bolivia 's nationalization of the company 's holdings six years ago . <P> Boliva 's actions seemed a show of pique that might well pass as soon as the government found out who was paid off . The only name Gulf has disclosed so far is that of Ren Barrientos , Bolivia 's President from 1964 to 1969 , who received a $ 110,000 helicopter from Gulf in exchange for doing what he could to forestall nationalization and assure the company of lucrative drilling rights in Bolivia . ( Barrientos died in a helicopter crash six years ago ; officials assert the chopper was not the craft purchased by Gulf . ) Still to be accounted for are two additional payments of $240,000 and $110,000 to Barrientos supporters . <P> Gulf officials in the U.S. said that they would supply names at " the earliest possible moment . " ( Dorsey remarked that " people just do n't write memos about things like that . " ) Arguing for Dorado 's release Gulf contended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ payoffs . Last week , however , a Bolivian judge ruled that there were " indications " of guilt " against him . Dorado asserted that he was only a low-level employee responsible for transport , administration and public relations . The government 's real target was Dorsey , who said : " They have no power to extradite me and I have no intention of going to Bolivia . " The Bolivian press report quoted a judge as saying that the Bolivians would go so far as to ask the U.S. Supreme Court to order Dorsey or a representative to La Paz . <P> Bolivia 's moves showed just how high official anger is running against U.S. multinational firms , chiefly oil companies , for their widening payoffs . In South Korea , U.S. and Japanese firms reportedly budget 5% or 10% of operating funds to pay off avaricious local politicians and political parties .
