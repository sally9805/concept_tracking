 | It was a mild May evening in 1975 and the sun was still an hour above the horizon in the long , Texas twilight . Bobbie Jean Wilson was clearing up the kitchen after dinner . She put the remaining hamburger in the oven to keep it warm until her 18-year-old son Mark came home . Her other son Todd , 12 , had already eaten and gone to the barn to feed the quarterhorses . Her husband A. L. Wilson , a financial consultant , was in London on business ? and their large twostory house in Terra Estates , in Lubbock , seemed empty without him . Bobbie Jean , a tall woman with curly brown hair and a merry smile , turned from the sink when she heard the kitchen door open . It was Todd ? but he was not alone . A grotesque stranger stood there ? a pillowcase with torn out eyeholes over his head . His left hand held the end of a rope that had been looped around her son 's waist ; the stranger 's right hand held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ playing a joke on me , she thought and started to laugh . " It 's no joke , Mom ! " Todd said in a strange tense , high-pitched voice . The masked figure pushed the gun to Todd 's head , eased the hammer back and said , " He 's right . If you do n't do what I tell you , I 'll shoot . " A sharp , sudden fear knifed through her . " What do you want ? " " I want $25,000 , " the man said , waving the gun wildly . Bobbie Jean stared at him in complete disbelief . " We just do n't have that much money . " " Maybe not , " the stranger answered , " but a bib shot family like yours knows where to get it . " The intruder asked the name of her bank and if she knew anyone who worked there . Bobbie Jean calmly told him their account was at Lubbock National Bank , where their friend , Coffee Conner , worked . " In the morning , soon as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that bank and your friend is going to get me $25,000 . Coming up from the barn , the kid said his brother will be home after a while . I 'm warning you , do n't  | anybody try anything or I 'll kill this little boy . " With the gun pressed against Todd 's head , the man ordered Bobbie Jean to lead them to the master bedroom . Then he demanded to know when she expected Mr. Wilson . " Soon ? very soon , " she said . She was determined to keep him from learning that A. L. was out of the country . In the bedroom , the masked figure handed Todd some wire . " Here , kid , tie your mother 's hands with this . " With trembling fingers , Todd wrapped wire around his mother 's wrists . Then the gunman shoved her into the large bedroom closet . Bobbie Jean sat on the floor so she could see into the bedroom through the partially open closet door . The gunman , dressed in baggy pants and a white wrinkled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sit beside him . Nervously , the man tapped the blue-green shag rug with one toe . He wore scuffed brown shoes , no socks . The next two hours seemed to last forever . Todd fidgeted on the bed , his eyes glazed with fear . His captor began to pace the floor chain-smoking , holding the rope which still circled Todd 's waist . At times , the intruder was out of Bobbie Jean 's range of vision . She wondered desperately what he was doing . Reuben Escobedo , the 23-year-old intruder , waited impatiently for the arrival of the husband and older Wilson boy . Only the day before , Escobedo had hitchhiked to Lubbock , passing Terra Estates . People who lived in large houses like this could put their hands on a lot of money , he figured . Money was what he wanted , and the gun , a .22 " Saturdaynight special , " which he 'd bought at a pawnshop , would help him get it . He 'd selected the Wilsons as his victims because their barn provided a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Escobedo was waiting inside the barn . Now a car stopped in front of the house . Bobbie Jean heard Mark 's voice calling good-byes to his friends . She waited , agonizing , wishing there was some way she could warn him . Mark , a tall , athletic boy , walked into the bedroom and stared incredulously into the muzzle of Escobedo 's gun . " Where 's my mother ? " he demanded . " Here . . . in the closet , " she said . " Please , just keep quiet and do what he says or he 'll kill you ! " Escobedo gave Todd more wire and ordered him to tie his brother 's hands together in front of his body . While the gunman held one end of the rope around Todd 's waist , the youngster began to bind Mark 's wrists with the wire , but his hands shook so , he could n't fasten it . " Do n't you know how to do anything ? I 'll do it myself , " Escobedo said , brushing Todd aside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knot and then tied Mark 's hands to the doorknob . For another interminable length of time , Bobbie Jean waited in the closet , dreading the night ahead , longing for her husband 's strong presence in this hour of great need . Suddenly Escobedo asked to watch TV . He untied Mark from the doorknob. but kept the wire secured around his wrists . Mark pushed the closet door wide and helped his mother to her feet . She squeezed his arm , reassuringly , but her hand trembled . She stood still for a minute , composing herself . She had to keep her head . for her sons ' safety . Then all four of them filed down the hall to the den . Bobbie Jean turned on the color television . " I need a better mask , " Escobedo said . " Do n't any d1f you have a ski mask ? " " My little brother has one up in his room , " Mark said . " I 'll show you where it is . " Bobbie Jean felt a flicker of hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone with Escobedo , she hoped the man would agree , because she might have time to call for help . Better still , Todd could run to a neighbor 's . Escobedo killed her spark of hope when he said , " We 'll all go and get the mask . "  | Mark led the way to Todd 's room , where Todd took his multicolored ski mask out of a bureau drawer . Escobedo ordered them out into the hall . Then , still holding the leash that kept Todd captive , he switched out the bedroom light . In the dimness , Bobbie Jean could - ce the pillowcase come off the man 's head , revealing a mass of long black hair , but it was too dark to make out his features . In a moment , the ski mask covered his face and they all went back downstairs . Escobedo wandered around the large den , running his hand over the polished wood paneling , touching the red print fabric of the twin sofas . " I figured there 'd be money in a place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choice of captives . " Not all that much money , " Bobbie Jean said . My husband has worked hard for what we have . " " Maybe so , " Escobedo ' aid skeptically . " But you Sure do n't know what its like to be poor . " " Are you hungry ? " she asked . " There 's a hamburger in the oven . " " Yeah . " He sat down on the sofa , ate the hamburger and washed it down with milk . Someone on TV made a remark about a hit man and he audience roared with laughter . " It 's not funny , " Escobedo snapped . " If you try anything , the kid gets it . " He pointed the pistol at Todd , pulled the hammer back and , with glittering black eyes , stared at the boy . Then he gently eased the hammer down and leaned against the sofa pillows . He 'll really kill Todd ! Nought Bobbie Jean , and the realization sent a chill through her . She felt Mark tense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to touch him , to calm him down . They had to escape . Somehow , she had to find the way . Escobedo continued to ramble on . He . sked Mark , " Do you smoke pot ? " " No . " " That 's good . I do n't smoke pot or take dope , either . " Bobbie Jean felt a new fear rising inside her . Maybe he was n't telling the truth . Maybe he was strung out on drugs tight now . If he were , it would explain his rambling , disjointed talk . It could also mean he would n't need a reason for his actions . He might shoot without even thinking . Maybe if she kept him talking she could distract him . " Do n't you have any family ? " she asked . @# " Sure . " He told her his parents lived in New Mexico , where he was born . He had two brothers and three sisters . He had dropped out of college after one year . He was quiet for a moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he suggested they all try to sleep . Mark stretched out on the floor , not taking his eyes off the gun . Todd lay on one sofa , Bobbie Jean sat on the other . Escobedo lay on the floor grasping the rope attached to Todd 's waist . Several times Escobedo asked Bobbie Jean why her husband had n't come home . Finally , she told him A. L. must have gone out of town on business . He would probably be home early the next morning . The gunman continued his rambling discourse about the money he planned to get from the bank . Sometimes he said he wanted $25,000 , other times $35 , - 000 . At one point he said , " If they offer me less than $3,500 , I 'll kill the little boy . " He emphasized his words by pointing the cocked pistol at Todd 's forehead . Bobbie Jean held her breath . Only when the hammer eased back with a soft click , did she dare to breathe again . Mark dozed off for short periods and Todd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awake , keeping vigil over her sons throughout the night . The kidnapper 's dark eyes , unceasingly alert , watched them all . Just before dawn , Escobedo herded them all into the master bedroom 's walk-in closet . explaining he was going to sleep for a few minutes . Now that the intruder could n't see them , Bobbie Jean considered removing the wire from Mark 's wrists , but decided against it . Better to just loosen it , so Escobedo would n't get suspicious . When they had a chance to jump him , Mark could free his hands . " Will he really kill us ? " Todd asked . " Not if we do exactly as he says , " Bobbie Jean replied , hoping she was telling the truth . Suddenly there was an explosion just outside the closet door . Bobbie Jean jumped , her heart pounding . " The gun went off accidentally , " Escobedo yelled through the door . " See how easy it goes off ? " Terrified , Bobbie Jean and Todd clutched each other , but there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took them back to the kitchen , where Bobbie Jean made breakfast . Escobedo and the boys ate , but she could n't swallow a bite . Mark asked for and got permission to call the friends he usually rode to school with , explaining that he was sick and would n't be going today . Then all four of them sat in the den , waiting for the bank to open . " You do n't need my mother and little to brother to go to the bank ? just take me , " Mark begged . " And let them call the cops ? I 'm a little crazy , but not that much . We 're all going to the bank together , " the gunman replied . At nine o'clock , they went out to Bobbie Jean 's car . She drove , with Mark in the front seat beside her . Escobedo and Todd rode in the back , the rope still looped around the boy , and the gun aimed ominously at his head . During the 20-minute ride , Bobbie Jean prayed fervently that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She parked across the street from the bank . Todd and Escobedo followed Bobbie Jean and Mark to t bank entrance . The ski mask drew son curious stares from passersby , but n one seemed alarmed . In the bank Bobbie Jean led her grot : to Vice President Torn Locke . " We ' got to see Coffee Conner . It 's urgent she said . " He is n't here , " Mr. Locke replied . " Then please help us ! Somebody h. to give this man money or he 's goir to kill my son ! " " He 's going to kill us all ! " Todd crie tears streaming down his cheeks . A bank guard hurried toward they Shoving Todd in front of him , Escobeo yelled , " Stay right where you are ! " The guard halted . " Now , take your gun out and put on the floor . Then move away from it : The guard obeyed , moving back a fe feet . Sick at heart , Bobbie Jean realize there was no way the guard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the bank and he was too clo to Todd , who looked as if he might fa ' any moment . " How much do you want ? " Loc. asked . " Thirty-five . " " Thirty-five-hundred dollars ? " Escobedo nodded . " That 'll be enough They followed Locke , who ordered the nearest teller to give them $3,500 . " Give the money to the woman . Escobedo commanded . With Bobbie Je .. carrying the money bag , the robbt herded them toward the door , pausin long enough to pick up the guard 's gun Outside , they hurried down the stret toward the car . A bank employee had alerted tM police , but the two motorcycle patrolme dispatched to the scene could only wan : helplessly as the kidnapper rushed h. three hostages toward the car . " Do n't do anything ! " Mark yelled the patrolmen . " He 'll hurt my lit ' brother ! " They got in the car as they had befo : c Mark and his mother in front , Todd ar . Escobedo in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where he could n't , seen from the street . " The cops better not try anything . : you 'll be sorry , " he yelled . " Let 's g out of here . You know how to get : Houston ? " Bobbie Jean nodded , started the cal and headed out of town . The two motor cycle patrolmen followed . From the corner of her eye , Bobbt saw Mark working frantically to get tht wire off his wrists . The money bag 1:1 on the seat between them . Escobedo raised up enough to glany behind them . " The cops are followin us . Tell them to get back . Somebody ? % ? %% ? ' . ? AND THAT 'S THE TRUTH If you think your children do n't know the value of money , try to borrow some from them . ? C. J.

" Mark thrust his arms out the window and made frantic gestures to the policemen to stay back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speedometer needle hovered at 100 miles per hour . " Why do n't you give yourself up ? " Bobbie Jean said without turning around . " They 'll only charge you with robbery now , but if somebody gets killed .. . " " You let me worry about that . " Escobedo looked out the rear window again . He turned to Mark , " Kid . see if you can get the cops up here and tell them to stop following us or I kill the little boy . " Mark leaned out the window as far as he could and motioned for the patrolmen to pull alongside . When they did , Mark yelled , " He 's got a gun ! Quit following us ! If you do n't , he 'll kill my little brother ! " The policeman shouted back that he had orders to stay with them . " You ca n't ! " Mark cried . " He 's going to shoot my brother ! " " I do n't have the authority to call off the tail , " the cop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who does . " He slowed down and the Wilsons ' car shot ahead . The police chief had ordered a road block set up 50 miles outside Lubbock . In minutes , eight police units had assembled at the designated point . The Wilson car hurtled toward the roadback at 100 miles an hour , followed by an incredible caravan of 25 police vehicles , a loudspeaker atop one of them broadcast commands for the speeding car to halt . A Department of Public Safety helicopter hovered overhead . Mark kept tugging at the wire binding his wrists . The knot loosened and in a few more seconds he was free . Bobbie Jean touched her son . He looked at her questioningly . " If there 's a roadblock , " she mouthed , I 'll hit the brakes . You grab the gun . " It was a wild chance , but they had to try . Mark nodded . Escobedo scrambled from one side of the back seat to the other , trying to watch the police as well as his hostages . The roadblock loomed abruptly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seat . Bobbie rammed her foot on the brake . The sudden jolt flung Escobedo forward . Mark lunged over the seat , his hands reaching for the gun . The startled gunman twisted away from him and his knee came up , thudding against Mark 's chest , knocking his breath from him . Doggedly , Mark held on , half over the seat . He grabbed Escobedo 's wrist and tried to force the gun loose . Bobbie was aware that it could go off accidentally and any of them could be killed . Finally , the gun fell from Escobedo 's fingers and Mark grabbed it . He tried frantically to get the guard 's gun but could n't . The car screeched to a stop in the middle of the highway . Police swarmed around it . One officer jerked open the door on Mark 's side and , mistaking him for the bank robber , hauled him roughly outside and took the gun from him . " Leave him alone ! " Todd yelled . " Do n't hurt him ! That 's my brother . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and handcuffed him . The bank guard 's gun lay on the back seat . It was 10:05 A.M. , more than 15 hours after Todd was taken captive in the barn . Bobbie Jean Wilson , pale , shaken , exhausted , put her arms around her sons and held them close . Their horrifying ordeal was over . Her boys were safe . A few months later , Texas Governor Dolph Briscoe , nominated Mark Wilson for the 1975 Young American Award for Bravery . " His rapid reaction not only saved his family from possible injury , but also guaranteed the safety of officers making the arrest , " the governor said . Mark and Todd Wilson , however , are convinced that any medal for bravery should go to their mother for her strength , courage and cool thinking during Escobedo 's reign of terror . On October 9 , 1975 , Reuben John Escobedo was diagnosed as schizophrenic , with marked ego disorganization . He was considered incompetent to stand trial . However , on May 17 , 1976 , he was judged competent and stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in prison .
