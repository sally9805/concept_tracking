There is hardly a living American abstractionist more laden with praise than that master of the peachy void , Jules Olitski . To call him the most suave and accomplished of color-field painters is one thing . But to claim him as a hero of history is weirdly premature . In a catalogue introduction to the Olitski retrospective that he organized for Boston 's Museum of Fine Arts ( it is currently on view at the Albright-Knox Museum in Buffalo ) , Curator Kenworth Moffett pronounced that " Olitski is ... saving the easel painting itself as a viable modernist idiom . " No less . <P> Yet for all the excess of such encomiums , Olitski-a husky , affable , blunt-headed Russian who was born in Snovsk in 1922 and emigrated to New York with his mother the next year-is a force to be reckoned with . He has next to no public face , for he prefers the quiet of a huge loft-studio on lower Broadway-out of which comes an undistracted flow of work . But his reputation is that of an artist who , more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Morris Louis , isolated and developed pure color as the hub , the very subject , of painting . <P> Olitski was not always a colorist . The earliest works in the show-a group of thick-surfaced , brown-and-white pictures from the late ' 50s-are weak monochrome transcriptions from the piled-up , earthy pigments of French painters like Dubuffet and Fautrier , whose work he had seen during a sojourn in Paris from 1949 to 1951 . But in 1960 Olitski started pouring dye onto large canvases , and the vibrant stains of color that resulted caused a shift in the direction of his style . In retrospect these Olitskis of the early ' 60s-like Osculum Silence , which won a prize in the Carnegie Institute 's painting competition in Pittsburgh , or Chemise-are among the sharpest and most resonant works of his career . With its broad oval swaths of blue , pink and green acrylic , Chemise both hammers the eye with its chromatic intensity and soothes it with the slow coiling of its forms . <P> But gradually the color took absolute precedence . Olitski recalls a conversation in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have the appearance of being just color . Then I remarked that if only I could spray some color into the air and somehow it would remain suspended , that 's what I would want . Just color by itself . I thought it was amusing , and so did everyone else . But that evening , going to sleep , it occurred to me that it was a serious notion . " <P> Airy and Melting . Hence Olitski 's switch to " allover " fields of color that filled his canvas from edge to edge , as in paintings like Doulma ( 1966 ) . Rolled and sprayed , the beads of paint coalesce in shimmering veils and crusts of color ; their cellular clustering compares to the more formal dots of Seurat 's pointillisme rather as Pollock 's drips and squiggles did to conventional line drawing . Olitski 's colors range from the airiest and most melting lavenders , pinks , apricots and pistachio-greens to nocturnal Prussian blues and ultramarines . In fact , the temptation to describe them in terms of candy or decorators ' samples @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ degree .
