The new regime guides a merciful , but moneyless , revolution <P> " This is a polite revolution " With those words Sergio Ramirez Mercado , soft-spoken leader of Nicaragua 's revolutionary junta , summed up all the changes in his nation since the overthrow of Dictator Anastasio ( " Tacho " ) Somoza Debayle five weeks ago . Polite has meant , above all , merciful . After 46 years of stifling one-man rule , the pervading atmosphere of fear is gone . There has been no reprisal by the victors ; not a single member of Somoza 's national guard has been executed , though its members killed thousands during the revolt . Despite predictions to the contrary , the unity of diverse political groups who joined together to topple Somoza has not collapsed . Instead , Nicaraguans of differing ideologies seem to be luxuriating in the unaccustomed privilege of political freedom . <P> No sooner did the junta feel secure enough in victory to lift a 7 p.m. curfew than Managua burst into noisy life . Roadblocks at major intersections came down , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old American films like Mandingo began to attract crowds . Radio Sandino , voice of the Sandinista National Liberation Front ( F.S.L.N. ) , adjusted to the brand new beat : to its broadcasts of revolutionary anthems it added disco hits by the Bee Gees . <P> Meanwhile , the Government of National Reconstruction was issuing many welcome decrees . First came an end of censorship , permitting long-silenced newspapers like the stridently anti-Somoza La Prensa to start up their presses . Homes , cars and other property that guerrillas had confiscated during their battle with Tacho 's national guard were ordered returned to the rightful owners , though some of the Sandinistas were reluctant to give up their " liberated " booty . Last week a 52-article provisional constitution was announced , containing guarantees of equal justice under law , the abolition of torture and capital punishment , and the right to free expression . Of the 3,000 guardsmen and Somoza thugs that the junta had held in custody while determining if they had committed atrocities in the despot 's name , more than 1,000 have been cleared and allowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the revolutionary army . <P> Since the majority of Somoza 's ministers fled into exile with the departed dictator , the junta has resorted to unusual tactics to recruit civil servants . " I called every friend in my telephone book until I had a staff , " one harried official told TIME Correspondent Roberto Suro . To ensure that the bureaucracy does not fall back into the predatory pattern of the past , the junta enacted a tough anticorruption law that provides hefty fines for malfeasance . Says Ramirez : " A government official today can stick his foot in his mouth , but not his hand in the cookie jar . "
