txt " This is our land , " said Joe Upickson angrily ' , - " and the United States Government and the State of Alaska have no right to claim it or sell it . " Mr. Upickson is a Point Barrow Eskimo , born and brought up on the vast , treeless , hill-less , oil-rich North Slope of Alaska . Slight and very soft-spoken , being angry does not seem to fit him . But angry he is ? at any reference to the now-famous $900 million sale of North Slope oil leases in 1968 by the State of Alaska to seven of the world 's largest petroleum companies . His indignation is shared by many of the 5,000 or so Eskimo who live along the state 's northern fringe . And Mr. Upickson 's anger is echoed throughout the Alaskan hinterland where nearly 70 perccent of an estimated 60,000 other Alaskan Eskimo , Indians , and Aleuts live . Altogether , they claim some 90 percent of the state 's surface In the villages where most of native Alaska lives , partial or total @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much stock Is placed in allegations that the quality of life for the native Alaskans will be raised by state revenues from North Slope oil . Most native leaders are emphatic : It 's the land that 's needed . // *Alaskans seek unity and clout // The natives have pinned their future to a bill submitted to Congress by Sen. Fred R. Harris ( D ) of Oklahoma . The measure calls for retaining 60 million acres of land . S500 million in cash and a perpetual 2 percent override on all minerals  --  including oil ? extracted from the state as compensation for the land lost . ? But there are two other measures that have also been submitted . Sen. Henry M. Jackson ( D ) of Washington , out of whose Senate Interior Committee a bill will eventually come , has sponsored a measure allowing native Alaskans retention of 10 million acres and Si billion as compensation . The money would be paid over a 20-year period . Bill passed The bill passed the Senate last year , but the House did not have time to act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Congress has been an administration-sponsored measure that would allow native Alaskans 4C ' million acres of land , and Si billion in compensation for the rest . The money would be paid over 20 years . The final legislative outcome is unclear Capitol Hill sources say . Eight years ago such mass native aggressiveness would have been unthinkable But recent events are indicative of a growing awareness of native Alaskans of the vast social and economic discrepancies that exist between the state 's native and nonnative populations The vehemence with which it is expressed is said to be due , in part , to increasing native recognition of the tragic enormity of the consequences of past native-nonnative relations ? notably , government management of native affairs . Lack of effort reported There has been little effort to bring native Alaskans into the white-collar professions , since so many lack even the most fundamental educational skills . So the promise of " enormous prosperity " once the oil starts to flow holds little meaning for the native Alaskan . There are signs that the situation of the native Alaskan is improving . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great change  --  either now or in the near future . Victims of the white men 's guns and white men 's diseases in the early days , they later proved ready pawns in the West 's rush for whale oil , furs , fish , and gold . Used primarily as cheap labor , Alaskan natives saw only a small fraction of the wealth that was eventually extracted from the land . Throughout the state 's subsequent booms and busts , most of them continued to live much as they do today ? in abject poverty The only significant change in their lives over the years has been a decreasing ability to live off the land  --  incomes of native Alaskans are generally so low and prices so high , most must rely on the land for a good portion of their food  --  and an increasing reliance on the Bureau of Indian Affairs ( BIA ) and other federal agencies responsible for their well being . The BIA , instituted close to 80 years ago in Alaska , is charged with the responsibility of bringing the native Alaskans into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it is a documented fact that native Alaskans are generally undernourished , undereducated , underemployed , inadequately housed , often misunderstood , and largely underestimated . It is a situation many of their leaders are blaming the federal government for . And many and bitter are the charges leveled at the BIA . Lack of direction hit Some members and former members of the bureau have charged that there is no direction to its educational and vocational programs  --  that bureaucracy has replaced purpose . More than one native leader has accused it of substituting sensitivity with initiative-sapping paternalism . Others have accused the agency of simply neglecting large areas of its responsibilities . Housing and education are the most frequent examples raised . BIA officials counter by saying they are doing as much as possible with the limited funds and personnel at their disposal . There are some positive sides to the picture . In recent years the native Alaskans have begun to organize . Since 1966 , a number of regional organizations have sprung up . Today there are 12 official associations , all of which are tied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In less than four years time , the AFN and its subscriber groups have garnered enough respectability to take over many services formerly administered by the BIA . ( The agency is being phased out of Alaska . ) Poi.er acquired In the process , the organizations have acquired enough political clout to become an important swing vote in statewide elections . More importantly , however , has been the AFN 's transition into a quasi-official spokesman for all native Alaskans in the current push for congressional settlement of their claims to some 340 million acres of the state . The discovery of North Slope oil and the state acquisition of land under the Alaska Statehood Act of 1959 provided the natives with the unifying catalyst . ( The state is supposed to select 103 million acres of federal land under the act . ) As word of the state acquisition of land spread , natives retaliated by filing blanket claims that began adding up to significant portions of the state . By 1966 , native action prompted then Secretary of the Interior Stewart L. Udall to impose an informal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state . The move was to buy time for the Congress to settle the matter once and for all . Response made In response to the subsequent congressional investigation the next year , the fledgling AFN proposed legislation that was basically similar to the present Harris bill . The major difference was that the natives were only asking for 40 million acres . The only other difference lay in the methods of land distribution . To push their claims , the federation hired considerable lobbying muscle in Ramsey Clark , former attorney general , and Arthur Goldberg , former United Nations ambassador . Both are working for the federation in an advisory capacity . Still nothing came of the AFN bill or any other land-claim measure filed over the following months . Two years and a few dead bills later , Secretary Udall turned the freeze into a public land order  --  a move which dubbed it the " super land freeze . " The order has since been extended twice and is due to run out this coming June . Few people believe that the eventual settlement , no matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But many are convinced that it will be a crucial factor in the success or failure of the current native-Alaskan drive for self determination .
