By virtue of that , I presume that they held that an inquiry into their political beliefs orwriting or thoughts was an infringement on freedom of speech and of the press . It 's a very broad interpretation and one that I would not advisea client of mine to attempt . But the case is still in the courts , andthere is no reason to conclude that they are going to jail . " " My own impulse , " Barbara said , " is to tear up this wretched pieceof paper and forget the whole thing . " " Which I would hardly advise . That would be a contempt . However , your father and I both know a number of people of influence , and it 's possible we could get this subpoena withdrawn . Or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather not say how . " " Harvey , you mean you could pay off members of the committee ? " " Your words , Barbara , not mine . " " Harvey , stop being so damn cautious and legalistic . If you are talkingabout bribing one of those bastards , I will not have it . Not by my father and not by anyone else . Furthermore , neither my father nor my mother is to know anything about this until I choose to tell them . " " I think you 're wrong . " " I think I 'm right . " " You understand , the alternative is that you must go to Washingtonand testify ? " " Will you come with me ? " " Of course . But again , let me ask you very seriously , is there any questionthey might ask that you would refuse to answer ? " " No , of course not . They 're not going to ask me who I slept with , arethey ? " " Oh , no . No , indeed . The questions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question you about him ? " " Is n't there something in the law that allows a wife to refuse to testifyagainst her husband ? " " I do n't know whether it applies to a congressional inquiry . Probably , but I shall make sure . " " It does n't matter . There 's nothing I know about Bernie that Iwould be , unwilling to talk about anywhere . " MARRIAGE 41 " If they ask you where he is ? " " Ten days from now , that wo n't matter , " Barbara replied . The ten pilots and three navigators who were to fly the C-54s east were staying at the Marypol Hotel in Hollywood , on Hudson Street between Hollywood and Sunset boulevards . It was an old dilapidated firetrap of a structure and catered to unemployed actors and a few transients . Brodsky chose it because it possessed a single virtue : it was cheap , five dollars a day for a single , seven-fifty for a double . Even at that price and buying their own meals , the volunteers had run up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's resources were down to a hundred and eighty dollars . Bernie emptied the till at the garage to make up the difference . Driving down to Los Angeles , Brodsky argued that Bernie should take command of the operation . " Who 's in command now ? " " Nobody . That 's just it , Bernie . I suppose this could be called a Haganah operation . But the point is that nobody knew just what kind of an operation it would be because nobody knew when and how the Czechs would deal with us . They had to find someone there who could be paid off and arrange for the sale without putting his neck on the chopping block . Then they had to find the two million . That took over six months . Then they had to figure out a way to get the money to Czechoslovakia and get the Messerschmitts to Palestine . When we heard about these C-54s for sale , they sent me out to make a deal . HerbieGoodman and three of the pilots came with me , and the rest we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the five of us spent three weeks driving around and talking people into the job . We actually did n't know how many planes we could find . At first we thought it was only three . You see , the way we figure the cargo area , we ca n't get more than one Messerschmitt inside a C-54 , and that 's disassembled . It sounds crazy that a country that 's going to be at war and fighting for its existence any day now should be waiting for an air force in this kind of crazy way , but that 's the way it is . But me , I never thought about it as a military operation , but with the ten planes , that 's what it is , would n't you say ? " " No , " Bernie said emphatically . " You 're out of your mind . I do n't know what kind of laws we 'd be breaking in terms of conducting a militaryoperation here in the United States , but there must be at least42 THE ESTABLISHMENTtwenty . And anyway , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a militaryoperation . " " O.K. Then you 're boss . How does that grab you ? " " It does n't . You started this thing . Why do n't you finish it ? " " Because I 'm half your size , and I do n't look like a boss of anything . We got a bunch of lunatics waiting for us down there at the Marypol Hotel . All right , they 're good guys , but do you know how crazy you got to be to try to fly those crates to Czechoslovakia ? " " You said the planes are airworthy . " " Sure . Herbie and a guy named Calvin Council  --  he 's a navigator and a pretty good mechanic , he 's from El Paso and he 's not Jewishwell , he and Herbie went out and spent three days going over the planes . They seem to be all right . What else can I tell you ? Bernie , please , take it on . You 're the boss . " By the time they reached Los Angeles , Bernie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evening when they parked and walked into the Hotel Marypol , Bernie carrying the briefcase of money in a tight grip . Herb Goodman was waiting for them . He told them that six of the men were up in his room , playing poker . The rest were out somewhereor other , except for Seltzer , who was keeping an eye on Mick White , who was in his room getting drunk . " We 'll take Mick White , " Bernie said , " him first . " He handed the briefcase to Goodman . " There 's a hundred and ten grand in there , so do n't let go of it . Just stay with us . " Mick White , about thirty , pale , short , and going to fat , looked at Bernie out of glazed , bloodshot eyes . He was pouring vodka out of a quart bottle that was half empty . The tiny room was drab , its paint peeling from the walls , and lit by a single unshaded bulb that hung from the ceiling . " You certainly found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would n't put a dog in a place like this . " " Who the hell is he ? " Seltzer demanded . He was a tough , hard , streetwise kid with a Brooklyn accent , and he regarded Bernie with open hostility . He sat back to front on a wooden chair , with a glass of vodka in his hand . There was a small , dirty sink on the wall at one side of the room . Bernie took the bottle out of Mick White 's hand and poured the vodka into the sink . When Seltzer leaped to his feet to stop him , Bernie flung him back against the opposite wall with a sweep of his arm . " You sonofabitch , " Seltzer began , going at Bernie , who turned to face him , holding the vodka bottle by its neck . Seltzer stopped short . MARRIAGE 43Bernie was six inches taller , fifty pounds heavier , and Seltzer was conditioned to authority . He had spent five years in the air force . " My name is Bernie Cohen , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Take one more step , and I break this bottle over your head . That might cost us a pilot , but we 'll find another . You are a pilot , are n't you ? " " You 're damn right . " " You 're Jewish ? " " Yeah . " Bernie nodded at where Mick White sat slumped in the one other chair the room contained . " He is n't , so maybe that excuses something . But you , mister , you take a drink again before this is over and I 'll break you in two with my bare hands . " He finished pouring the vodka into the sink . " You 're real tough , " Seltzer said . Bernie nodded . " Yes . More than you might imagine , mister . So what do you say we just play it cool and easy , and no more trouble , right ? " He held out his hand . Seltzer hesitated . Then he took Bernie 's hand . Then Bernie went to White and asked him how he felt . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . That 's tomorrow . " " Sure . " Bernie put his arm around White and lifted him out of the chair , and with White struggling and swearing , he dragged him to the sink and forced his head under the faucet . " Turn it on , " he told Brodsky . For at least two minutes , he held the struggling , cursing White under the faucet . " Get him a towel . " " Motherfucking Jew bastard , " White said as he wiped his face . " You a pilot ? " Bernie asked . " I 'll fly your ass off , you lousy , oversized pile of turd . " " Good enough , " Bernie agreed . That night at ten o'clock , the pilots , navigators , and five radio operatorswhom Goodman had recruited in Los Angeles gathered in what the Hotel Marypol was pleased to call its banquet room . Not having been rented for a banquet these past ten years , the room was half filled with old beds , mattresses , broken chairs , and one-time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The volunteers sat facing Bernieand Brodsky . The only thing they had in common was that they were all veterans of World War II . Their ages ranged from the middle twenties to the middle thirties . Of the pilots , seven were Jewish , two were Catholic , and one was a Baptist . Two of the navigators and one of the radio operators were not Jewish . What forces impelled them , Bernie44 THE ESTABLISHMENTdid not know . Possibly they bore some of the guilt for the holocaust ; possibly they wanted a break in the dullness of postwar life , a chance to travel , an opportunity to put their hands on the controls of a four-motorplane again . Or possibly the motives of the non-Jews were as deeply buried and entangled as those of the Jews . None of them were in it for the money because no one was being paid ; they were guaranteed food and lodging , such as it was , and passage home from Palestine , though neither Brodsky nor anyone else appeared to know just how that would be managed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ film director who had just had a notable success , two were actors , one was a carpenter , one had quit the Los Angeles Police Force , four were students , two were selling insurance , and two others had taken a leave from jobs as pilots for large corporations . Two of the radio operators worked as televisionrepair men . Oddly enough , nine of the group were married , and with this information , Bernie wondered how many of them , like himself , had used this as an escape hatch , a way to flee , a way to " bug out , " as he put it to himself , of real life . Or was this real life ? Or was anythingreal life ? What had Barbara said to him once , that no male of the species ever reaches maturity ? Wars were games , politics were games  --  deadly , senseless murderous games of children in adult bodies . Glory , idealism , and courage were the three mindless labels . " Still and all , " he told himself , " someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to them , " My name is Bernie Cohen . As much as anyoneis in charge of this operation , I am , and I intend to see it through . So if any of you have any second thoughts , doubts , or misgivings , now 's the time to speak up and get out . " He waited , but no one spoke . " All right . We 're going to leave here at five A.M. and drive to Barstow . I say five A.M. because we 'll take off if all goes well at five the following morning , and I want the lot of you dog-tired so you 'll sleep . I do n't care if you do n't sleep tonight as long as you get a good night 's sleep tomorrow . That will give us a whole day to work on the planes . We 're flying into a field at Melville , New Jersey , and the weather conditions look good . We 've got maps , and we 'll lay out our flight plans tonight . Now , how many of you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Good . There is no rank here . Tomorrow , everyone pitches in and works with the mechanics . Tonight , I want you to throw out every question you can think of . Let 's have no loose ends . " Tom Layette , two years older than Barbara , was Dan Layette 's first child . It was common gossip in certain San Francisco circles that theMARRIAGE 45two Lavettes , father and son , had not spoken to each other in almost twenty years . Since San Francisco is not a very large city , and since the group of men who control the wealth and power of the city is even smaller , Dan Layette and his son were bound to come face to face periodically . On such occasions , they both respected the widening gulf that separated them , and each made no effort to resume contact with the other . Observing this , Jean would press the subject with Dan . " He is young and insufferable , if you will , but he is still your son . " Dan would simply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let it rest there . In time , Jean no longer raised the possibility of a reconciliation . She herself saw her son regularly if not frequently . About once a month , he would call and ask her to lunch with him . When Jean remarried after her divorce from Dan , she chose John Whittier for her husband . He had inherited the largest shipping line on the West Coast , and during the war years it had expanded enormously . After his marriage to Jean in 1931 , he had developed a growingfondness for Tom , possibly less as a person than as the potential heir to the Seldon Bank . When Tom came into his share of the controllingstock of the bank , Barbara sold him a portion of her share , quite willing to let him have it ; then his interests merged with Whittier'sto form an entity they called Great Cal , one of the largest holding companies on the Coast . Through the years , Whittier 's position as the dominant force in the corporation weakened . He saw Tom originally as a rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without too much ambitionand drive . In this , he misjudged him . During the next dozen years , Tom established himself as the major force in the combine . Now , at sixty , Whittier was a petulant , overweight hypochondriac who had already suffered one real heart attack and at least a dozen imaginary ones . Nominally the president and the chairman of the board of directorsof Great Cal , he was little more than a figurehead . Problems were brought to Tom and decisions were made by Tom . In western financial circles , he was regarded as one of the most powerful and promising of all the young men who had come into industrial control at the end of the war . Jean had not heard from him for well over a month when he called and asked her to lunch with him at the Fairmont . When Tom did not lunch at his club , he ate at the Fairmont . Jean once asked him why , in a city that boasts more good restaurants than any other city of its size in46 THE ESTABLISHMENTAmerica , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replied , " Mother , I do not eat in strange restaurants . " Jean knew enough about her son to make anyone else , possessed of her knowledge , dislike him intensely . For her part , she would not judge him and she refused to dislike him . He was agreeable and pleasant to her , and he was also quite handsome . She thought of this as he came across the dining room to join her , more slender than Dan , but with Dan 's height and breadth of shoulder and with her own blue eyes , light hair , and fair skin . Jean felt that physically , both children had the best of both of their parents . He greeted her warmly . " Mother , you look absolutely splendid . Still the most beautiful woman in any room you enter . " " What nonsense ! I am fifty-eight years old , and I make no attempt to hide or deny it . " " No need to . " " What on earth makes you this amiable ? " " I always am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which has happened . Anyway , I am glad to see you . Sit down , and we 'll have a drink to celebrate . We live in the same city a few streets apart , and we 're more or lessstrangers . " " I 've been busy , mother , " Tom explained . " Very busy . " " Of course you have . You 're a throwback , Thomas . You remind me of your great-grandfather who began as a placer miner in fifty . But he soon discovered that one ca n't pan gold fast enough to become really rich , and so he became a usurer , lending out his gold at three hundred percent . When I was a child , well , by then he had become a banker and had slipped to twenty or thirty percent , but when I was a child , he would give me a ten-dollar gold piece on each birthday . Only it broke his heart to let go of it . You would enjoy seeing the way he fondled it . I think the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was counting his money . " " Mother , " Tom whispered , " you do say the damnedest things . " " Yes , I suppose I do . And I do wonder what drives you , Tom . You have enough money to sit back and enjoy life . " " I enjoy what I do . It 's not the money . That 's just a way of keepingscore . " " Not very original . I wonder . " " Then did you ever wonder , mother , who makes this country work , MARRIAGE 47who keeps the wheels turning , who makes it possible for people like yourself to enjoy life , as you put it ? " " Bravo . Now stop snapping at me and order some drinks and lunch , and then you can tell me why I 'm here . " After the food arrived , Tom said flatly , " John has been pestering me to get married again . " " Oh ? " " Do n't just say oh . " " Is this something we should discuss ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Does that make it too sticky for you ? Who else do I talk to ? " " A psychoanalyst  --  please , do n't be angry . " " No ! " Jean pecked at the food for a few moments . She had not expected anything like this , nor did she know quite how to handle it . Finally she said quietly , " All right , we 'll talk about it . As much as I can . I do n't know  --  " " Neither do I , " Tom said . The note of pleading in his voice was something she had not heard in a long , long time , and it melted her and brought up all the guilt she suffered from a long-standing and deepseatedcontempt for this man , her son . " Very well , " Jean said as flatly as she could . " John Whittier wants you to get married . What earthly affair of his it is , I do not know . Do you want to get married ? " " I have plans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm running for Congress . I do intend to be elected . Six years from now , in nineteen fifty-four , John and I feel I have a very substantial chance for governor . If I can get the Republican designation , with Earl Warren 's record in this state , I am as good as elected . " " And that 's what you want so desperately  --  to be governor ? " " It 's a step . " " And then ? What then ? " " I 'm not sure . The Senate , perhaps . John has his own strange ideas about the White House , but that 's what every upright American boy wants , is n't it ? " " Yes , every upright American boy , " Jean murmured . " And why not ? I have a decent war record . I have the money and the position , and I 'm no fool . " " You certainly are no fool , " Jean agreed . " I 'm just trying to understand it . You can not grow up in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or politicians . It 's a nasty game , played mostly by wretched men . Well , you have your dreams . Tell me , is there someone you want tomarry or is it just a general notion ? " " There is . Lucy Sommers . " " Al Sommers ' daughter , " Jean said , recalling the retired vice presidentof the Seldon Bank and his single child , a dark , long-legged girl . She had never cared very much for either of them , and she had not seen Lucy for years . " She 's a widow , is n't she , and at least four yearsolder than you , if I remember rightly ? " " Yes , that 's so . It does n't matter  --  the age , I mean  --  and a widow does n't carry the implications of a divorcee . It 's bad enough that I haveone divorce on my back . When I think of Eloise  --  " " We 're not discussing Eloise . " " No , we 're not . Well , Lucy and I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there are concrete benefits for both of us . There are no children , and living alone is no pleasure for any woman . She 's a very striking and handsome woman , she 's an excellent hostess , and thankGod , unlike Eloise , she enjoys the role . " Concrete benefits for both of us , Jean thought . My God , what a wayto approach a marriage ! " What do you think of her ? " he asked Jean . " I hardly know her . Certainly , she 's elegant , and I imagine that iswhat you want . Does she know ? " Jean asked uneasily . " I mean  --  " " I know what you mean , mother . I made it very plain to her that Iam not interested in sex , that we would live in a civilized arrangement . She agrees . " " And what about her sex life ? " " She has been doing without it . She 's apparently content to continuethat way . " " I 've heard of such things . " jean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parts . " " It will be a small wedding , just a few people . Will you come ? " " Without Dan ? " Jean asked . " I do n't think so . " Tom stared at her . " If I were you , " Jean said , " I would take a trip . France or England oreven the Islands . Get married there . A sudden , romantic decision , andthen there 's nothing in the papers to worry about . " That night , Dan asked her about the luncheon , and she told him ofTom 's plans . " Is he in love with the woman ? " Dan asked . MARRIAGE 49 " I do n't think so . " " Then what in hell is he walking into this marriage for ? " " Your son , " Jean said calmly , " is a very rich and important man , as such things are measured in our lives . He 's also ambitious . You may think he 's a bastard , Dan . " " I never said that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he is n't  --  any more than most men are . He needs the form of marriage , if not the function . " Dan stared at her for a long moment before he said , " What are you trying to tell me , that he 's a faggot ? " " I hate that word ! " " Then he 's a homosexual ? " " You 've never suspected it ? " Gently , she said , " Danny , do n't eat yourself up with this . We have enough horrors in our past . Do n't add any more to them . I want so desperately to have a little bit of decent happiness before it 's over . " Barbara and Sam went to Huntington Park the same day that Jean lunched with Tom at the Fairmont , a stone 's throw away . Barbara went on foot ; Sam was pushed in his stroller , facing her and grinning with pleasure at the cool , clean wind that blew in from the Pacific . Barbara never tired of being with her child , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that this fat , alert , and good-natured young man had come out of her very own loins . She had few of the discontents of the average mother and housewife , but then , she had lived a good deal of her life before becoming a mother and a housewife , and to her Sam was an improbable miracle . She knew she would not have another child . She often listened with curiosity to other young mothers in the park , most of them a dozen years younger than she , but she listened without being a part of it . It seemed that she had always watched and listened to a world outside her  --  it was part of being a writer ; and in her new book , the book she was at work on , she was attempting a story about just such people as the young mothers she met in Huntington Park . She enjoyed listening more than talking , preferring to talk to Sam . He received the profound and the mundane with equal placidity . He was infrequently bored , and when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or a teething ring . Today , staring at the Fountain of the Turtles , she informed Sam that it was a gift to the city from the Crocker family and a copy of a fountain in Rome . Sam decided that he wanted to sit on the rim andPART TWOGames50 THE ESTABLISHMENTtouch the water . " You know you pee when you dabble in water . Well , why not ? Sooner or later , anyway . " They sat on the rim of the fountain . " You know , " Barbara informed him , " the Crockers could n't bear not to have something in the park here . I wonder if they were jealous of old Collis Huntington . Do you know , he was a friend of my grandfather ? Grandpa used to tell me how they would both ride the cable car up California Street and then walk off to their respective mansions . Truth . Both of them had great , magnificent old mansions right up here on top of Nob Hill . Grandpa 's was there . " She pointed . " Huntington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember when they tore down grandpa 's house  --  twenty-eight , or was it twenty-nine ? I was fourteen or fifteen , and it just broke my heart . It was an ugly old place  --  " She stopped . A rapt expression had come over Sam 's face . " Ah , yes . And now we go home and change your diaper . " She picked him up and put him back in the stroller . " Someday , God willing , you 'll learn to talk , and we 'll have perfectly wonderful conversations . " Walking back to the house on Green Street , Barbara tried to understand why she was neither distressed nor unhappy . Her husband had gone off on a wild , unlikely adventure and she herself had been subpoenaedby the House Committee on Un-American Activities  --  in spite of which she was quite content and reasonably happy . " I must be a very strange and unfeeling woman , " she told herself . I do n't like to bargain with Jews , " Mr. Kennedy said . He was a large man whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ westernhat , and his white duck suit was soaked with sweat . " Too grasping . " He clenched a fist to illustrate his point . " Money , always money . I 'm sticking out my neck to sell you these planes , Mr. Cohen . Suppose you take them out of the country . That 's against the law . I been reading up on the law . I had a dream and God said , Sell them the planes . Only I was awake . My wife testifies to that . She says there I was sitting bolt upright in bed with my eyes wide open  --  bug-eyed . So I say it 's the word of God . But God respects a man 's right to do business as he sees fit , as long as he do n't skin his customers . And I ai n't skinning you . Taking a fair profit , but that ai n't skinning . Do you know what one of them planes costs new ? " They were sitting under the tin awning in front of Kennedy 's buildingsupply store @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the heat . Bernie wiped his brow and said softly , " I 'm not trying to skin you , sir . " He hefted his briefcase . " Right here , I have one hundred and ten thousand dollars in fifties and hundreds , unmarked bills , Mr. Kennedy . Let 's talk plainly . You would n't take a check . You wanted cash . " " Hell , mister , are you accusing me of illegal dealing ? " " No , no , no . Absolutely not . Still and all , you wo n't find many customerswho can pay cash and not put it on their books . This money is not on anyone 's books . You might have to look far and wide to find anothersituation like this , and meanwhile those planes are sitting out there in the desert sun and deteriorating . Deteriorating . You know , we asked Lockheed what it would take to put them into shape . A hundred and fifty thousand each . Mr. Kennedy , those damn things are flying coffins . " " Appears you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " What 's your proposition , Cohen ? " 54 THE ESTABLISHMENT " We picked up five more radio operators and two more navigators . They 'll be here in Barstow before midnight , but they got to be paid . Two hundred each , that 's fourteen hundred dollars . Then we got the hotel bill for the rest of my men , and food , and so help me God , we do n't have a nickel . Only what is here in this bag . Now if you 're going to stick to your price , I 'll just have to cancel out , pay our bills , and look elsewhere . " " Elsewhere ! Where the hell elsewhere you going to find planes like these at this price ? There ai n't none . " " There 's sixteen C-46 cargo jobs down near San Diego . They do n't have this range , but they 're a damn sight better for our needs . " " Cohen , you 're bluffing . " Bernie shrugged and waited . " Suppose I said one hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a damn bit of good . " " Christ , I hate to do business with Jews . How much do you want out of that bag ? " " We need three thousand dollars to cover us . I 'll give you a hundred and seven thousand dollars , take it or leave it . " " Just do n't get snotty with me , boy , " Kennedy snapped angrily . " How in hell do I know that money 's clean ? You 're in Barstow , not in L.A. Suppose I call the sheriff and tell him you 're sitting here with a bag of hot money ? Sheriff 's a friend of mine . " " Call him . " Bernie shrugged . " I know where the money came from . You want the sheriff to hear where it came from and check it out  --  that 's O.K. with me . " " You are one nasty sonofabitch . " " It 's your deal , Mr. Kennedy . " " You really going to fly them planes to the Holy Land , Cohen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Kennedy , " Bernie said patiently . " You know all about Truman 's proclamation number two seven seven six . You told me that yourself . You know that under the law we ca n't take these planes out of the country . " " That 's what my lawyer tells me . " " Right . Now suppose you should be under oath , and they say to you , Did you know where those planes were going ? All you have to say is that their flight plans were cleared for Melville , New Jersey . All aboveboardand absolutely legal . Now , do we have a deal for a hundred and seven thousand ? " GAMES 55 " Boy , you 'd squeeze blood from a stone . " He nodded . " We have a deal , boy . You squeezed me , and I caved in . We do have a deal . " The afternoon of the same day , Dan telephoned Barbara and told her that he and jean were dining out . Would she join them ? " Daddy , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But Bernie will call me this evening , and I ca n't leave the house . I have to wait for his call .

" " Then look , daddy , I 'm housebound anyway . So after you eat , why do n't you and mother stop by , and I 'll give you dessert and coffee and we 'll talk for a while . Would you , please ? " " I 'd like that , " Dan said . " Good . Then I 'll see you later . " Filled with a sense of unease , Barbara put down the phone . Somethingin her father 's voice  --  or was it her imagination ?

It was only two days since he had left , and suddenly , at this moment , it turned into an eternity . She had not really missed him until now ; in all truth it had been a relief to find herself alone with her child and the mistress of her own destiny . Now , for some reason she did not entirely understand , her mood had changed . When she married , people had wondered about her alliance with a penniless ex-army sergeant ; but as Dan said to her at the time , " You 've found a man , Bobby . I can understand that . " Yet it was not the thing of maleness or toughness or ruthlessness ; he was none of those things .

We made the deal for the planes , and the boys have been working on them all day . " " I 'm terrified of those damn planes . Will they fly ? " " Like birds . Believe me . " " And how do you feel ? " " I feel great . Hell , I miss you and the kid . I miss you terribly . But I needed this . My soul was rotting away . That has nothing to do with you , Bobby , or with how much I love you , believe me . " " I understand . " " I 'm alive again . It 's a good feeling . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm filled with guilts . " " Oh , damn the guilts. just get it done and come back in one piece . " " That 's my intention , " he said . " We 're in good shape . We have a radio operator on every plane now , and that was the thing that worried me most . We 're only short two navigators , and we 'll make out with that . " " When do you take off ? " " Dawn tomorrow . The weather 's good right across the country , and we should be in New Jersey no later than four o'clock , Eastern time . Listen , Bobby , I never had a chance to talk to your father about what he did . I was so damn compulsive about this thing that I never even took the time to think about the size of what we asked . God Almighty , the man gave me a hundred and ten thousand dollars without even blinking an eyelash . What a hell of a thing to do ! " " I think so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bobby , why ? Do you know why he did it ? " " Sort of , not entirely . He 's a strange man and he 's had a strange life . He just does things that other people do n't do . " " You can say that again . Will you thank him ? Make him understand that I wo n't forget this . " " I 'll try , Bernie . " " I love you very much , Bobby . In my own , stupid , neurotic way . " " I 'll take that from where it comes . There are things about you that I admire , Cohen . Not many , but some . " " I 'll nurse that . God bless you . " Barbara put down the telephone and leaned back and stretched her legs and closed her eyes . Tonight she would thank Dan . " Daddy , I want to thank you for being as idiotic as my husband . " No , not quite that way . Then why had he done it ? To repay a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There was no way to repay the dead . There must have been reasons , very deep-seated and compelling reasons . Barbara wondered whether she had ever understood her father or his true motives for anything he did . Did she know him at all ? She remembered an incident once , long ago , shortly before his divorce from Jean , when he had asked her to have dinner with him , just the two of them , alone . He was reaching out , desperately , like a drowning man ; but Barbara was unaware of that , unaware of anything except that this man , her father , had betrayed her mother and was having an affair with a Chinese woman . Barbara remembered very well indeed how that had horrified her . It was years before she actually met May Ling and came to know her and love her . At that time , she had only a sense of adolescentdisgust and outrage ; and , adding insult to injury  --  as she saw it then  --  her father took her to the same restaurant to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's , where the proprietor praised her beauty so lavishly , chattering to her father in Italian , bringing out all her ethnic fears and resentments . Then Barbara had turned on her father like a wounded cat , clawing , insulting , demolishing him . The memory of it brought tears to her eyes . The thought of that strong , magnificent figure of a man , still young , Dan Layette , who with his two hands and his brain had subdued a proud , intolerant city and made it his own domain , cringing under her anger , the scorn and anger of a witless schoolgirl , was almost more than she could bear . How little she had known and how little she had understood ! It was almost eight o'clock . Enough of this , Barbara decided . What was done was done . There remained at least another hour before her father and mother would appear , and that could conceivably produce a page of usable if not immortal prose . She went into her study and sat down at the typewriter . It was almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rarely seen her mother so relaxed and ebullient . She wore a new dress that Barbara had not seen before , a high-collared , deep blue and black taffeta , with long sleeves and a tiered skirt . The great high collar framed her neck and shoulders . Barbara stared at her in undisguised admiration and said , sighing , " If I could ever look like that ! " To which Jean replied , " Oh , my dear , I 'm an old woman , pretending . You have no need to pretend . You will never guess where we dined tonight . We just turned the clock back right to the-beginning . At the Palace , in the great dining room under the glass dome . Oh , I will admit that the kitchen has pretty well gone to seed , but there it was , and do you know , Dan58 THE ESTABLISHMENTand I have n't been back there together since nineteen eleven . Can you imagine ? Nineteen eleven  --  and this is nineteen forty-eight . " Dan dropped into a chair . Barbara thought he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a slight smile on his lips , the way one might watch a totally adored child , uncritically , as if to say he asked no more than the right to be near her , to look at her ; and seeing him that way , Barbara tried again to understand how her father could love two women so completely and so long , thinking again of the strange , bemusing puzzle that Dan Layette presented . " He wore his tuxedo that night , " Jean went on . " In nineteen eleven . Dinner jacket to you , my love , but then we called them tuxedos . Why , I wonder ? Do you know , Danny ? " " Not a notion . Hell , I 'm no authority . That was my first one . " " And the very first time he wore it on a date , Bobby . Oh , he wore it to the house , to a dinner party . That 's why he had it made , to come and dine with the very swell Seldons on Nob Hill , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Tenderloin . " " Not little . Daddy was never little , " Barbara protested . " He was born large . " " Thank you , " Dan said , taking out a cigar . " You do n't mind ? " " I wish you would n't , " Jean said . " Well , if you must . Anyway , it was our first formal date , and Danny wore the tuxedo and he took me to dinner at the Palace . Dinner at the Palace , my dear , in nineteen eleven would feed a family of five today for at least a week . Seven courses , and each with some silly French name , and there was young Dan Layette , all of twenty-two years old  --  " " I still ca n't read a French menu , " Dan muttered "  --  and being so very sophisticated . I 'm sure he decided that if I ate myself into a comatose state , he could have his way with me . Do you remember , Danny , brook trout and venison and quail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the expression on his face as the courses kept coming . Dinner was not nourishment in those days . It was an endurance con-test . " Dan burst out laughing . Then Barbara saw the laughter turn into a grimace of pain . He was trying to light the cigar and he dropped it . He bent to pick it up , stopped , and sat bent over . " Daddy , what is it ? " Barbara cried . Jean ran to him and put her arms around him . " Danny , are you all right ? What is it ? " GAMES 59 " I have the most godawful pain , " he managed to say . " It 's ripping out my gut  --  and here in my arm . I think you 'd better get a doctor . " Barbara had never before seen her coldly beautiful mother  --  whom May Ling used to refer to as the snow lady  --  react like this . She appeared to go to pieces completely , overcome with terror and clutching Dan , who muttered , " I 'm all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Barbara called Dr. Kellman and found him at home ; after listening to her description of what was happening , he said , " It sounds very much like a heart attack . Do n't be too alarmed . Dan is in good shape . I 'll order an ambulance , and I 'll be there in a few minutes . Where is he ? " " Just sitting here in a chair . " " Help him lie down on the floor . Do n't let him try to move . I 'll be right over . " Barbara put down the phone . " Mother , " she said evenly , " I want you to pull yourself together . Daddy will be all right . Dr. Kellman says we should help him lie down on the floor . Daddy , " she said to Dan , " I 'm going to hold you while mother pulls the chair away . " " I can get up , " Dan said . " I know . But do it my way . " She bent over her father , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strength . She eased Dan down onto the floor as Jean pulled the chair away , and then said to her mother , who stood there trembling , her make-up smudged with tears , " Mother , go upstairs and get a blanket from my bed , please . Quickly . " Barbara put a pillow under Dan 's head . " How do you feel ? " she asked . " Rotten . What did he say ? Am I having a heart attack ? " " Or maybe the Palace Hotel is taking its revenge for your low opinion of their food . Come on , daddy , how does he know ? " Again Dan 's face contorted in pain . He reached out and clutched Barbara 's hand . Jean came down with the blanket , and they covered Dan . About ten minutes went by before Dr. Kellman arrived ; the ambulance came a few minutes later . Jean clung to Barbara as they watched Dan being wheeled out in a stretcher , a mask over his face , breathing from the portableoxygen unit . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dr. Kellman said to Jean . " We wo n't know anything for certain until we 've run some tests . I 'd guess it 's a coronary . I hope it 's a mild one , but as I said , we wo n't know for sure until later . " " I ca n't leave Sam , " Barbara said woefully . " I 'll call Eloise and ask6o THE ESTABLISHMENTher to come first thing in the morning . But you will call me from the hospital , please ? " " Of course . " She hesitated . " Should I tell Tom ? I just do n't know  --  " " That can wait . " " And you 'd better call Joe . " " Yes , " Barbara said . " I thought of that . " Jean and the doctor left , and Barbara closed the door behind them . She experienced a brief moment of panic  --  first her husband , now her father , as if some force were intent on divesting her of those she loved , of the men who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of protection and security behind which a woman must always crouch . " Well , " she reflected , drawing a deep breath , " I have never been one to crouch and my walls have a way of crumbling . As a matter of fact , I have even gottenout of the habit of weeping . " She went to the telephone to call her brother Joe . Joseph Layette , now thirty-one , was Dan 's son by May Ling . When Joseph was ten years old , May Ling , finding the situation of being Dan 's mistress and living in a shadow of his life intolerable , moved to Los Angeles . Two years later , Jean and Dan were divorced , but another two years went by before Dan and May Ling were married . Dan did what he could do to be a father to his half-Chinese son . Joe Layette completed college and medical school , was drafted into the army , did his internship and residency in the South Pacific during World War II , and soon after his discharge married Sally Levy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Angeles for the past two years , where Joe worked in a free clinic . Joe answered the telephone , and Barbara told him what had happened . " It 's after eleven , " he said . " If I can still get a plane , I 'll be there tonight . What hospital did they take him to ? " " Mount Zion . It 's at Post and Scott , not far from here . " " I know where it is . Can you put me up for the night , Bobby ? " " Of course . " " And if I ca n't get out tonight , I 'll call the hospital and talk to Kellman . But I 'll be there first thing tomorrow . " Setting down the telephone , Barbara asked herself , " Do I tell Bernie ? " But that , she decided , would be pointless , just as she had decided that it was pointless to tell him about the subpoena from the House committee . Barbara could not face the thought of going to bed ; in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be able to sleep . She sat down with a book , but she was unable to concentrate , and after reading half a dozen pages without the faintest memory of what she had read , she put the book aside and switched on the radio . She twirled the dial until she picked up a news program , wondering whether there might not be something about Bernie and the planes . She listened to a congressman talk about America 's need for an uninterrupted flow of atomic weapons and switched it off in disgust . Again and again she reached for the telephone and pulled back her hand . She must have dozed , for it was twothirtywhen the telephone rang , its shrill jangle bursting into her sleep . It was Joe . " I 'm at the hospital , Bobby . Pop 's not going to die . He 'll pull through . " " Joe , are you sure ? " " Pretty damn sure . As much as one can be at this point . He 's still in intensive care and in an oxygen tent , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fairly severe coronary infarction , and he 'll have to be on his back for quite a while , but he 's a hell of a strong man and he 'll come out of it . Did I wake you ? " " I 'm not in bed , Joe . I 'll wait up for you . " " All right . I 'll take Jean home first . She 's not in good shape , and I 'll give her something to calm her ; then I 'll come over to your place . " " Oh , thank you , Joe . And thanks for rushing up here . " " Not that I could contribute anything . Kellman 's a good man , but I feel better now that I 'm here . " She dozed off again . It was well after three when Joe rang her doorbell , and they sat in the kitchen , drinking coffee almost until dawn . Barbara told Joe about Bernie and then about the subpoena . " It never rains but it pours . You poor kid . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Barbara said . " The marriage was n't working , and it was n't getting any better , only worse . It 's bad enough to have a marriage go down the drain when you hate the man . But when you love him  --  and I do love him so much , Joe  --  well , then it 's just awful . And about the subpoena , Harvey Baxter assures me I have absolutelynothing to worry about . Evidently someone on that Un-American Committee is literate enough to read and read my book about what happened to me in Europe , and Harvey says that they go out of their way to pull celebrities down there  --  not that I 'm such a celebrity  --  and then they make a circus out of it . To tell you the truth , Joe , I 'm rather excited about the whole prospect . I feel somewhat the way I felt when I62 THE ESTABLISHMENTwent to Germany in nineteen thirty-nine , a little afraid , yet terribly curious to see the devil in his den . " " Does pop know about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course , but not about the subpoena . I do n't want anyone to know , and you 're the only one who does besides Harvey Baxter . I suppose that when I go to Washington it 'll be spread all over the papers , but until then I just do n't want to be bothered , and certainly daddy does n't need this now . " With ten years of intermittent warfare behind him , Bernie Cohen was neither a pilot nor a navigator nor a radio operator . He rode as a passengerin one of the big C-54s as the ten planes took off , one after another , from the desert airfield . They flew into the morning sun , just lifting above the horizon . Bernie 's plane was piloted by Jerry Fox , a small , redheaded , freckled young man who looked eighteen but was actually twenty-six , and who had been with the Tenth Air Force . The navigator , who also doubled as radio operator , was Al Shlemsky , a dark , morose man of thirty who had been born in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the age of sixteen , and who , like Bernie , had enlisted in the British army . After the war , he had gone back to Palestine and joined the Irgun , the underground terrorist organizationled by Menachem Begin . Captured by the British occupation forces , he had been held in the Jerusalem Central Prison for seven months . " I was there when they hanged Dov Gruner , " he told Bernie , his dark eyes turned inward . " They hanged four of us  --  Gruner , Drezner , Alkochi , and Kashani . We just did n't believe it could happen . They were soldiers fighting for their homeland , and all our lives we had been fed that shit about the British being civilized . Then , when it happened , when they were taken out of their cells to be hanged , we heard them singing the Hatikvah . Someone yelled to us what was happening , and we began to sing , ninety of us singing the Hatikvah in that lousy jail . I remember that I was crying as I sang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came back to the States to see my mother . She was dying . Funny , she was a nice , plain , little orthodox Jewish lady , and she could never understand what I was doing in Palestine . I could never explain it to her , either . Then I heard that the Haganah guys here were looking for pilots and navigators , and here I am . " Jerry Fox , the pilot , was something else . He was enjoying himself thoroughly . " I never flew one of these cookies before , " he told Bernie , " but they 're sweethearts . They handle a damn sight better than theGAMES 63i7-G , and there 's nobody shooting at me . I did forty-two missions with the i7-G . I tell you , Cohen , this beats West Covina all to hell . You ever been to West Covina ? " Bernie shook his head . " You are fortunate . Outside of L.A. My folks live there . Pop runs a hardware store . I get out of the service and I 'm back in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting laid now and then and going crazy . Absolutely going crazy . There is nothing I want to do except fly an airplane , but go find a job with ten thousand pilots scrambling for the few jobs there are . And then this comes along . I 'd pay you to let me fly this crate . Funny thing is , I 'm not all that Jewish . My father is , but my mother 's Irish and I was raised as a Catholic  --  parochial school , the whole shtick . And here I am on my way to Palestine . If that does n't beat the shit out of it , nothing does . " Sitting in the copilot 's chair , the Rocky Mountains beneath him , the other planes spread out to the left and to the right , it occurred to Berniethat if anyone had told him a week ago that he would be here , he would have dismissed the whole notion as an incongruous dream . Sally Layette , Joe 's wife , was , as he would have been the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one thing , she had decided at the age of thirteen that Joe would be her husband , come what may . He was then working summers at the Higate Winery . At thirteen , she was a skinny , freckled , tow-headed kid who bewailed her lack of breasts and stuffed a brassiere with absorbent cotton to simulate them . By the age of twenty , when she and Joe were married , Sally had become a tall slenderwoman , blue-eyed , blond , with no need to simulate anything . At fourteen , she wooed Joe with sonnets copied word for word from ElizabethBarrett Browning and blithely signed Sally Levy ; at twenty , she published her own first book of poems , which was critically acclaimed and earned her all of eighty-six dollars . She was bright , ebullient , caustic , impetuous , and romantic . She informed her husband , once they were married , that she intended to bear him ten children . After the first was born , she reduced the anticipated number to three . Sally had many dreams , and one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like Barbara 's and preferably within walking distance of Barbara , whom she idolized . She decided that Joe should set up practice in such a house . It was precisely the place and life for a physician that fitted in with her plans . Joe thought otherwise , and this led to their first fight , wildly emotional on her part , stolid on his , and followed by a64 THE ESTABLISHMENT tearful reconciliation . Joe had his own plans , which he had worked out during the long , wretched years in the South Pacific . He wanted to op- erate a clinic in East Los Angeles , an area known as the barrio and in- habited for the most part by poor Mexican Americans , or Chicanos , as they called themselves in Southern California . He would have no part of Russian Hill or a lucrative San Francisco practice . He had no good memories of San Francisco , and he remembered all too vividly the sto- ries Feng Wo , his grandfather , had told him of the virulent anti- Chinese hatred that once infested the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he had an affection for the city that was beyond Sally 's understanding . Joe applied to the Layette Foundation for a grant , and with it he acquired an old , one-story , brick warehouse on Boyle Avenue in Boyle Heights . He then went into partnership with Frank Gonzales , whom he had known from medical school and who had been with him in the army . They remodeled the old warehouse into a neighborhood clinic , with examining rooms , an X-ray room , a room for minor operations , and a few emergency beds . They charged a very nominal fee , for those who could afford it , and nothing at all for those who could n't . For Gonzales , a small , dark , serious Chicano , the clinic was the fulfillment of all his dreams , and he looked upon Joe Layette as one of the Apos- ties might have looked upon his Master . Sally , who felt that her hus- band fell somewhat short of sainthood , adapted to the situation and ac- cepted it . Until the baby came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the clinic . They had purchased a tiny house near Silver Lake , a place in East Los Angeles that was no lake at all but a large , concrete- lined basin filled with water , surrounded by a chain-link fence and rows of dismal , dreary houses . It was the sort of place from which Sally was repelled at first sight and which did not grow on her . Joe felt that they had to live in East Los Angeles , and accepting that decision , Silver Lake was as good a place as any . Sally , having spent most of her life in the Napa Valley , found Silver Lake loathsome , even more so than the barrio where the clinic was . Sally still covered the receiving desk two days a week ; she would take the baby with her and keep her in a carriage beside her desk . She was a casual , unworried mother , and May Ling was a relaxed and easy child . The morning after Joe went to San Francisco to be with his father , Sally put May Ling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the clinic . She had written most of her poetry sitting there at the receiving desk . The place fascinated , repelled , and irritated her ; but GAMES 65Sally always converted herself into a third person , and the image of herself , still unrecognized as the foremost poet in the country , sitting at the receiving desk in a clinic in Boyle Heights , made a satisfying dramaticentity . She did not know Joe 's father too well , but she liked him , and the thought that he might be dying sobered her and depressed her as much as she was ever depressed . She was relieved to hear from Gonzalesthat Dan would pull through . " Joe called me , " he explained . " Why did n't he call me ? " " It was the middle of the night . He wanted me to be here early and cover for him . You know how Joe is . He would n't call you in the middle of the night . " " I know how Joe is . " " Look , Sally , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll put her in the X-ray room . Very quiet . No one bothers her there . " " No , I do n't want her in there with all that radiation . " " Sally , when no one 's using the X-ray , there 's no radiation . It does n't linger . " " So you say . " Gonzales sighed and gave up . A few hours later , Sally took May Ling into Joe 's office to nurse her . When the child was born , her doctor had suggested bottle feeding , which was very much in vogue . But Sally rejected the idea ; she felt she had adequate breasts for the first time , and she was going to do nothing to lessen their size . Having finally achieved size 32A , she could relinquish the notion that she was dismally flat-chested . There was always a rush at the clinic beginning at about nine o'clock and tapering off toward noon , when Sally would be relieved by one of the two nurses , Jessica Tamal or Roberta Syznick . Then she fed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the baby at her breast , she heard someone knock at the door . " Who is it ? " she demanded . " Is that you , Sally ? They said I 'd find you here . This is Billy Clawson . Can I come in ? " " Billy Clawson ? I do n't believe it . Sure , come on in . " He came into the room , closing the door behind him , and then stopped short and stared . He started toward the door again . " Maybe I 'll come back . " " For heaven 's sake , Billy , " Sally said impatiently , " have n't you ever seen a baby nursed before ? Or is it verboten to clerics ? Oh , do n't be66 THE ESTABLISHMENTsilly about it . Your sister 's married to my brother , so we 're practically related . Come in and sit down . I 'll be through in a moment or two . " He had to make an effort to tear his eyes away , and then he sat down and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his line of sight . Sally had never seen him dressed like this before : heavy brown turtleneck sweater , denim trousers , and old shoes . She had always consideredhim somewhat laughable , an amiable , inoffensive caricature of a man , without hostility and without ambition ; now it occurred to her that she had never actually looked at him before , or if she had looked at him , she had not seen him . He had a long head and a shock of unrulybrown hair ; not very handsome , she thought , but rather nice-looking , with dark , lonesome eyes . That was her label  --  lonesome eyes  --  and the notion pleased her . Words , especially adjectives , always fascinated Sally . Billy Clawson was glancing at her furtively , guiltily . She looked down at her breast , which May Ling was finally relinquishing , sucking mechanicallyand without enthusiasm , her pink face relaxed , her eyes closed , and she decided that it was well worth a furtive glance or two , a lovely , well-rounded breast . She covered it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After all , " she said to Billy , " I never had what you might call a proper breast until I was almost seventeen , and why on earth women cover up the best part of them , I 'll never know . " She hooked her brassiere together and began to button her blouse . " Of course , it 's something the men worked out . What an unbelievable set of pious , hypocritical bastards you all are ! " " Do you always say such outrageous things ? " " My dear Billy , we 've never really talked before . I 'm being absolutely demure . Now what on earth brings you down here ? This is the last place in the world I 'd expect to see you , here in Boyle Heights in Los Angeles . This is the barrio , Billy , the pits , the soft underbelly . Do you know , we treat more knife wounds than any other outpatient clinic in the city ? " " I came down to see Joe , and now I find that he 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his father had a heart attack . I 'm frightfully sorry about that . I only met Mr. Layette once or twice , but he appeared to be a very interesting man . Very vital . You do n't think of such people as being stricken . " Sally was smiling . Billy shook his head , confused . " I 'm sorry , " Sally said . " It 's the way you talk  --  forgive me . I 'm not reallylacking in compassion , Billy . I like Dan Layette , and Joe says he 's going to be all right . Have you had lunch ? " GAMES 67More confused than ever , Billy shook his head again . " Because I have an enormous sandwich here , " Sally said , unwrapping it . " Ham and cheese on rye . Please have half of it . I also have a thermos of coffee . I ca n't bear the coffee they make here , so I bring my own . Please . It 's more than I can eat . " It was his first more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ill-prepared for it . He accepted half of the sandwich because he could think of no way to refuse . " Could I help you ? " Sally asked . " I mean , if you made the trip to see Joe ? I 'm sure he 'll be back tonight . " " Well , I do n't know , " Billy said uneasily . " Or perhaps I should talk to you and not lay my burdens on Joe . I just had the notion that I might be of some use here , that there might be something here that I could do that would justify my going on from day to day . Does that sound crazy to you ? I 'm an Episcopal priest who actually ca n't bear to set foot inside a church . Now I 've never said that before , not aloud . " " And you see , " Sally said gently , " God has not struck you dead . " " Sometimes I wish He would . Trouble is , I do n't believe in Him very much . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , but mother insisted that it was a way to avoid the draft . I ended up as an army chaplainin the Pacific  --  two long , bloody nightmarish years from Guadalcanalto the end . And since my discharge I 've done nothing . Absolutely nothing . I just drift from day to day . " Sally stared at him in amazement . This was not the man she had met half a dozen times , not the man they gossiped about , not the man she had heard Joe refer to with total contempt . " What is wrong with me ? " she asked herself . " Why do I see people without ever seeing them or knowing who they are ? I 'm not a poet . I 'm an indifferent and blind fool . " " You see ? " he asked uncertainly . " I admire Joe so much , and I think what he 's doing is wonderful . It means something . Nothing I do means anything . My father wants me to go into the business with him . I ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wants me to get a post in a church . She has dreams of Grace Cathedral . I 'd be a stevedore on the docks before I 'd let them trap me into a place like Grace Cathedral . " " Then why are n't you ? " Sally asked him . " Why are n't I what ? " " A stevedore on the docks ? " " God knows . I suppose I have n't got the guts , and I 'd be taking the job from someone who needs it . I thought there might be work I could68 THE ESTABLISHMENTdo here , in a place like this . I do n't need the money . I have enough money . " " Do you know what kind of nasty , filthy work it is ? " Sally asked . " Not really , no . " " I mean , what could you do , Billy ? You have n't any training . " " I had two years in the Pacific , Sally . Do you think anyone in those hellish islands wanted an Episcopal priest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I spent most of my time , as a volunteer medic . I do n't know much of anything , but I do know how to deal with a man whose body has been mangled . It 's the only worthwhile training I 've had . And here no one knows me . I hate to say that 's important to me , but it is . " He waited while Sally stared at him . " Are n't you going to say anything ? " " I 'll talk to Dr. Gonzales . He 's Joe 's partner . " " Do you want me to talk to him ? " Billy asked . " No . Can you come back later , Billy ? Or better yet , call us at home tonight . I 'll give you the number . I 'd ask you to stay with us , but the house is tiny . " " Oh , no , no . That 's not necessary . I 'll find a hotel . I 'll call you tonight . Absolutely . " After he left , Sally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Gonzales said . " You got to be kidding . An Episcopal priest ? Anyway , what the devil is an Episcopal priest ? Like a Catholic priest ? I thought they had ministers . " " I guess it 's sort of the same thing as a minister . They can get marriedand all that . But , Frank , this poor guy is at the end of his rope . " " I met him . Come on , Sally , what can he do for us ? " " There 's more work here than we can handle . Maybe he can get me off the receiving desk so I 'll have time to be a mother and a writer . You know what happens when we have a heavy day . He says he worked with the medics . He must know something . " Gonzales shook his head . " He is just not it . This is the barrio . He 'll stay a day , and he 'll go . " " He also comes from one of the richest families in Oakland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clinic in California . " " Come on , come on . We function . We pay wages . Still and all , you say he is loaded ? " " His father . I do n't know what he 's got . " " Sally , you know what we could do with another ten , twenty thousand ? O.K. , I talk to Joe about it . " GAMES 69 " And maybe you 're just saving his soul . " That 's another line of work . " He paused and looked at Sally . " You 're a good kid . Only you push it . " " What does that mean ? " " Think about it . " When Barbara got to the hospital , shortly after nine the following morning , Jean was already in the waiting room . She told Barbara that Dan was sleeping . " How is he ? " " Better , they tell me . Who is with the baby ? " " Eloise . Was Joe here this morning ? " " Yes . He 's on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I see him ? " " As soon as he wakes up , I guess . " Jean was making an effort to keep her voice light and controlled . " I think he 's going to be all right . I 've had a bad time , Bobby . I want you to understand . " " I do . " " Yes . Perhaps more than I do , because all I could think about last night is that if he should die , that 's the end for me . That 's selfish , but then , I 've always been selfish , have n't I ? " " Mother , I 'm not going to feed self-pity . If a person dies , the living feel it , not the dead . I think you love daddy very much , more than you ever dared admit to yourself , so it 's perfectly natural for you to feel that if he died , it would be the end of everything for you . Only it would not be the end of everything . " " You 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unexpectedly , in a tone she had never taken with Barbara before . " Did it ever occur to you that my life has been no bed of roses , that I 've messed it up as much as one human being can mess things up ? " " It has occurred to me , yes . " " One small measure of happiness , having that man back for the last few years . After thirty years of misery . It went wrong from the very beginning , and neither of us knew why or how . " She went on . Real or not , the agony poured out . It was a side of her mother Barbara had never seen before , nor was she ready to believe it entirely . For three decades , Jean Layette had been , in her circle , the most beautiful woman in San Francisco , again by accolade of her small , tight circle ; and she had moved and lived in that circle with relish and pleasure . Or had it been a pose and a game ? In all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had never before witnessed this descentinto self-pity . The cool , austere , aloof Jean Layette was beyond such things  --  or was she ? Now she paraded her unhappiness before her daughter , a thousand nights of unspeakable loneliness , meaningless relationships , joyless gaiety . Barbara was cold inside . Suddenly , she wanted to be away from there . Somewhere in the world , there was reality . Jean 's plaint disgusted her , which in turn filled her with guilt and remorse . She was grateful when a nurse appeared and told them they could see Mr. Layette . Jean changed as they entered Dan 's room . Barbara was absolutely astoundedat how a whining , petulant , aging woman could suddenly becomeerect and self-confident and young and attractive . She gave a silentcheer . Jean was amazing . Blessings on her , as she kissed Dan coolly and said , " You never do things by halves , do you , Danny boy ? You had me quite terrified . " " That makes two of us , " he said weakly . " Hello , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Not bad , daddy , not at all bad . How do you feel ? " " According to Joe , it was a mild attack . The worst part is that they 'll have me in bed here for weeks . But I 'll manage . " A few minutes later , jean excused herself and left the room . " Where is she going ? " Dan asked Barbara . " I think she went outside to cry . I 've never seen mother cry . I do n't think anyone ever did until last night . It 's a pleasure she never permittedherself . I 'm going to cry any moment now , but it 's never been a problem with me . She 's terribly upset . She 's very much in love with you . Did you know that ? Or is that a dumb question ? " " It 's not a dumb question . I 've never really been sure . You know , Bobby , when May Ling died , I thought death had lost all meaning for me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother , after all those years , I began to care again . We 've led strange lives , the two of us . Last night I thought I was going to die . I did n't want to . Life was very sweet . " The flight across the country went more smoothly than Bernie had dared to expect . The March weather , so given to unanticipated storms , was as mild as a day in June . The planes stayed within sight of each other in a reasonably well kept wide pattern . They answered queries along the way and met with no interference . They landed in Dodge City , Kansas , to refuel . Debts were being collectedeverywhere . Over thirty years before , a Jew named Glazer and anGAMES 71Irishman named Sweeney had smuggled four crates of rifles and ammunitioninto Dublin . Now Sweeney 's son , reasonably successful in the oil business and bearing a residual hatred of the British as well as an unpaidobligation to his father 's partner , had supplied four tanker trucks of aviation fuel at a quiet commercial airport @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big , slack-bellied man in his fifties , had a bottle of fine old Irish in his car , and he and Bernie each put down a paper cupful . " What I would give to go with you , " Sweeney said . " It 's purpose you got , sonny , and I got no fuckin ' purpose but to get drunk twice a week and pretend I 'm a man . " Bernie saw him standing there , waving with both arms , as the planes took off . The flight continued without incident , and late that afternoon they circled the airfield in New jersey and received their landing instructions . Bernie 's plane came in first , and Jerry Fox brought it in for one of those landings where it is almost impossible to say that you are no longer airborne . " Sonofabitch ! " the pilot crowed . " What a beauty , what a daisy ! " As they came down , Bernie noticed a cluster of men at the far end of the field , and two of the men came running @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The airfield , lying in the sandy pine barrens of southern New jersey , was neither large nor well equipped . It had two X-shaped runways , three hangars , and a wooden control tower . Half a dozen small planes were parked near the hangars . Fox took the whole length of the runway for his landing , then wheeled the plane off onto a parking sheet of asphalt . The two men were running clumsily but hard to intercept it . Bernie saw another group of men leave the hangar and start toward the plane . The second C-54 had landed and the third was coming in . Bernie 's plane was still rolling . " Leave enough room for the others , " Bernie shouted to Fox . Then he ran back through the plane and opened the door . The first of the two men was shouting at him , but he could n't make out the words against the roar of the motors . The plane came to a stop , and Bernie dropped to the ground . The running man , panting , middle-aged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Where 's Brodsky ? " Bernie pointed to the planes coming in . " Who are you ? " " Cohen . I 'm running the show , for the moment . " 72 THE ESTABLISHMENT " Bernie Cohen ? " " Right . " The second man joined them . He was small , dark , dapper , breathless . " I 'm Jack Feinstein , " said the bald man , handing Bernie a dollar bill . " Take this . No time for questions . Trust me . " Bernie took the dollar bill . " Trust me . No time for questions , " Feinstein gasped . He took a sheaf of folded papers out of his breast pocket and handed a pen to Bernie . " Sign right here . Trust me . " The papers fluttered and rustled in the wind raised by the landing planes . " What in hell am I signing ? " Bernie demanded . " And who are you ? " " Feinstein . Lawyer for the Haganah . Look . " He pointed to the four men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got to sign before they get here . It 's a bill of sale . For a dollar and other valuable considerations , you are selling these ten planes to Senor Luis Montego . Lineas Aereas de Panama . For Christ 's sake , do n't stand there ! Believe me . " Brodsky was running across to them now . The four men were fifty yards away , walking quickly . " That 's Feinstein ! " Brodsky yelled . " He'sO.K. ! " " Sign it , senor , sign it , " Montego begged him . Bernie took the pen and signed . " Initial here and here , " Feinstein said . Bernie scribbled his initials . Feinstein handed the papers to Montego as the four men reached them . The last of the ten planes touched down . Brodsky , Jerry Fox , and Herb Goodman joined the group . The four men , all in dark business suits and unsmiling , faced the growing group of pilots , navigators , and radio operators . One of them displayed a badge . " Fenton , United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these planes . That means they are not to be entered or moved and nothing is to be removed from them . " " Let 's see your writ , " Feinstein said , still trying to catch his breath . " Who are you ? " " Feinstein . Attorney . " " Attorney for who ? " " Senor Luis Montego of Panama Airlines . " " I do n't know how he comes into this , " the Customs man said , taking a paper out of his pocket . " Here 's the order . President Truman 's proclamation two seven seven six . That puts commercial planes under the Munitions Control Board . " GAMES 73 " Only , " said Feinstein , " when such planes are taken out of the country for implied military purposes . " Another of the four men showed his badge . " Gently , Federal Bureau of Investigation . According to our information , these planes were purchasedyesterday from one Cary Kennedy in Barstow , California , by one Bernie Cohen , to be removed from the United States . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Bernie whispered to Brodsky . " The sonofabitch ! " " If that is the case , " Feinstein said , " the planes are here . You have no right to impound the private property of a United States citizen . " " Do n't be cute , Feinstein . " " I 'll be cuter . The planes do n't belong to Cohen . They are the property of my client , Senor Luis Montego of Panama Airlines . In other words , they belong to a foreign commercial airline , and any attempt to impound them will cause no end of trouble , gentlemen . Senor Montego has with him all the permits and export licenses required by law . Will you show them the bill of sale , Senor Montego ? " Smiling , Montego handed Bently the bill of sale Bernie had just signed . Bently glanced at it , handed it to his associates , and said sourly , " It wo n't wash , Feinstein . We know damn well what those planes are intended for , and it just wo n't wash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and were slapping decals on the tail assembly of the planes . The decals read : LINEASAEREAS DE PANAMA . " Stop that right there ! " the Customs man yelled . Then he said to the FBI men , " Will you take some action ? This is a scam . It 's a cheap , underhandedscam . " " You know the law , " Feinstein said . " You need a court order to void Mr. Montego 's export license . When you find a federal judge and get an injunction against the shipment of these planes to Panama and show us that injunction , we will comply with it . Until then , we will resist by every means at our disposal any attempt to prevent the departure of these planes . " " Are you going to let them pull this off ? " Fenton demanded of Bently . " Let 's get to a telephone , and we 'll see . " When they had gone , Brodsky introduced Bernie to Feinstein . The circle of pilots and navigators were grinning with pleasure . A man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who was the field74 THE ESTABLISHMENTmanager . " I got a hell of a lot of sympathy for you , " he said , " but this means trouble . " " Being alive means trouble . " " That may be . The point is , can you get fueled and take off before dark ? They 'll get that court order , believe me . " " I think so . We 'll try . " Feinstein led Bernie and Brodsky and Montego across the field to where his car was parked . He explained that Montego had a Jewish grandmother . " Half the world is Jewish , if you look hard enough . By the way , Luis here will fly with you to Panama . He has a crew waiting there to tear out the seats and convert the planes to cargo carriers . " At his car , he unlocked the trunk and took out two leather suitcases . " Two million dollars , " he said . " Cold cash . Ten Messerschmitts and all the munitions the rest of it will buy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you left it like that , " Bernie said , " sitting there in the car ? " " What did you expect , an armored car ? The trunk was locked . " Bernie and Brodsky each took a suitcase . " The closest we 'll ever get to being millionaires , " Brodsky said . Three hours later , the sun sinking behind the pines , the planes took off . The Customs men and the FBI had not returned . Sarah Levy came to visit Dan at the hospital . She brought a jar of nuts , a box of homemade cookies , and a bunch of yellow roses . " Although , " she said , looking around the room , " flowers are the last thing you need . You have enough already to start a flower shop . " " I know . A man never knows his rating in flowers until he 's dead . " " And you 're not dead , Danny . I do n't like to see you lying there feelingsorry for yourself . You 're a lucky man . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was thinking that it was almost twenty years since her husband , Mark , Dan 's partner and best friend , had died of a massive coronary occlusion . That was how it was written for him and his kind ; you clawed and scrambled and grabbed and went to bed each night counting another marker of money and power , and then it washed out in the same senseless ending  --  and for Sarah , the apparentlyendless years of loneliness and waiting . For what ? What did she wait for so patiently ? What would Jean wait for ? He wondered how old Sarah was now . Seventy ? Certainly close to seventy . She was a thin wraith of a woman , her hair white , her face wrinkled , the skin , once so white and pink , having long ago given up the struggle . He could re-GAMES 75member clearly the young woman Mark had married , her long yellow hair braided and piled in a crown on her head . Half a century had passed since then . Dan had been only ten years old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been twenty . Dan 's father had taken him into the chandler shop on Fisherman 's Wharf that was owned and operatedby Mark 's father , old Moe Levy , who had come across the country with a peddler 's wagon , trading gimcracks with the Indians . Sarah had just arrived , nineteen years old , an immigrant girl from Lithuania , alone , without family , tagged and shipped across the breadth of the country to marry a man she had never seen . Frightened , thousands of miles from a home she would never see again , surrounded by the babble of a strange and incomprehensible tongue , she was like a beautiful , terror-strickenyoung animal . " You 're a lucky man , Danny , " she said again . " I suppose so . " " Just give up the cigars and stop drinking and you have another twenty years . " She spoke in expected cliches . Did she think that way ? he wondered . Had she given up all the questions to which there were no answers ? How desperately he wanted a cigar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Joe was here ? " she asked him . " Came up the night it happened . " " He 's a good boy , such a good boy . Do you know how happy Mark would have been , your son married to his granddaughter ? On the other hand , my Sally is a very strange girl . She would try the patience of a saint . " " They 'll get along . " " I hope so . Jean has been here ? " " She 's always here . I chased her out . " He knew that Sarah could not reconcile herself to Jean , could not accept that they had come together after May Ling 's death . Dan realized that he wanted Sarah to go , to leave him be , and the realization filled him with guilt . What happened to people ? He had once adored Sarah . A thousand years ago . " You 're tired , " she said . " I guess so . " " Then I let you rest , Danny . Do n't worry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ESTABLISHMENTThe telephone rang , and Barbara , waiting eagerly , anxiously , grabbed it . The operator wanted to know whether she would accept a collect call from a Bernie Cohen in Panama . " Yes , yes , of course . " His voice came through , apologizing . " It 's just that there was no other way I could call you from here , Bobby . " " I know . Never mind , Bernie . Oh , I 'm so glad to hear from you . Are you all right ? " " Just fine . What about you and Sammy ? " " Strong and healthy and lonely . " " Do n't be lonely . A few more days and it 's done . Say , two weeks at the most before I get out of Palestine . " " Bernie , what are you doing in Panama ? " " I 'm at Tocumen Airport here . It 's our route , honey . It was all planned and laid out by the guys in New York . We got out of New Jerseytwo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sheriff . The FBI and Customs . We 're refueling here , and then we fly to the Azores , and then from the Azores to Czechoslovakia , where we pick up our cargo and take it to Palestine . " " Bernie  --  " She hesitated . " Bernie , do you have to go all the way ? Ca n't it go on without you ? " " I ca n't drop out now . Look , Bobby , I called because I was afraid you 'd get the news on the radio and begin to worry . " " What news ? " " We lost a plane . It went down over the ocean . Three good guys  --  Jesse Levine , Bob Sanders , and Al Green . If I stepped out of it now , it would throw them all into a panic . There 's just no way I could do it . " " But you said the planes were good ? " " They are good . This one developed engine trouble and came down . It happens . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't happen again . " " But three men are dead . " " We do n't know . They may have been picked up . We radioed their position , so there 's still hope . " Then she was silent until he asked , " Are you still there , Bobby ? " " I 'm just so damn miserable . I 've never said that before . I just feel you 're stretching this beyond luck . " " Bobby , I 'll be all right . " Barbara put down the telephone and sat and stared at it . An hourGAMES 77later , when the doorbell rang , she had still not severed the connection between herself and the black instrument she faced . jean was at the door . " How is he ? " " Much better , I think , " her mother said . " What were you doing ? " " Staring at the telephone . Bernie called . " " Where is he ? " " In Panama . " She told her mother what had happened . " I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you eaten ? " " Sort of . I 'm not hungry . Do you have any brandy ? " Barbara watched her mother sip the brandy . " About men , " Jean said . " They come in two sizes , you know . " " I did n't know . " " It 's time you did . It has to do with games , which is what differentiatesthem from animals . Animals do n't play games . " " Puppies ? " " Not really . Consider the lion . The lioness does the hunting , finds the food , delivers the children , and raises them . The lion does nothing . Struts and fornicates . Nothing else . " " I really do n't care to discuss lions , " Barbara said . " My world is very crumbly . Last week I was married to a sober , worried businessman who ran a garage that did n't make any money . Now my father is in the hospitalwith a heart attack ; my husband is in Panama with nine old airplanes  --  what do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Not that it matters . " Jean sighed and refilled her glass . " You 're entitled to get drunk , " Barbara said . " It 's all right . You can spend the night here . " " Have you ever seen me drunk ? And on brandy ? No . " " It matters . I ca n't stand people who are enigmatic . Anyway , it 's time we had a good talk . " " About men ? " " Yes , by all means . " " They play games . That 's a childhood preoccupation . There are essentiallyonly two kinds of men . They all begin the same . They play games , and one kind continues with the games and the other kind stops . But neither kind ever reaches adulthood . I can lay claim to being a modest authority , since I married both kinds . John Whittier was the kind who stops . It just died inside of him . Men like Dan and Bernie , 78 THE ESTABLISHMENTthey go on with the games . You 're like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of idiotic marriage . " " Thank you , mother . " " I 'm not being nasty , " jean said . " I fell in love with Dan Layette forty years ago . If he dies , I 'll be an empty , worthless old bag . But I do n't deceive myself . Anyway , I 'm talking a lot of nonsense , am I not ? " " Yes and no . " " Oh , I do wish you would n't be so damn righteous and superior . Try being a little girl for ten minutes . Tell me that you love me and that I exist ! " " I do love you , and I 'd look silly trying to be a little girl , even for ten minutes . I 'm a woman of thirty-four years who has a lot of problems . A week from now , I have to go to Washington and testify before the House Committee on Un-American Activities . " Jean put the glass of brandy and stared at her . " I do n't understand . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ added , " That 's impossible . It 's ridiculous and impossible . You 're a Seldon . " Barbara burst out laughing . " Mother , I love you , I do , truly . I am still a Seldon . My name was Barbara Layette , and then it became BarbaraCohen , but I am a Seldon . It 's so simple . But it is n't . " " Will you please tell me what happened ? " Barbara told her about the subpoena and her meeting with Harvey Baxter . " But this is my thing , mother , not yours and not daddy 's . I do n't want him to know . In fact , I do n't want anyone else to know about this yet , and I think with daddy in the hospital , you 'll agree he should n't know . " " I still do n't understand . Is this because of Bernie and what he 's doing ? " " No , it 's because of me . I am not a simple housewife who writes books between feedings . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have . What will you do about Sam ? " " It 's only for a few days . " " I 'll take him , of course . " " No , you 'll be with daddy . I 'll take him up to Higate and leave him with Eloise and Adam for a few days . They 'll be delighted . " " I wo n't hear of it ! " " Do you know , " Barbara said , " you are an amazing woman , mother . I do patronize you , and that 's sheer stupidity on my part . But it 's not basic . Basically , I think you 're quite remarkable , and I do love you . " GAMES 79To fly at night , Bernie decided , was to move out of man 's ordinary realityinto another world . Time and space collapsed , and the roar of the four motors obscured all other sounds of life ; yet beyond the motors they were ringed by silence , and the sound and the silence coexisted . He must have dozed off , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got it on automatic , Bernie . Sit at the controls for a while . " He pointed out the dials to watch relaxed and was asleep almost immediately . Bernie rubbed his eyes and watched the maze of dials . Shlemsky sang softly , " Twilight soon will fade , nobody 's left at the masquerade . . . " Ahead of them , the rim of the sea lightened and the first hint of a corona of light appeared . A while later , Bernie could make out the shape of the other planes , stretched across the sky in irregular formation . " Counting them ? " Shlemsky asked . " We 're all here . " " Not all . Only nine . " " Only nine , " Bernie agreed . " Better wake Fox . " The first glowing edge of the sun lifted above the water as he shook Fox awake . An hour later , one after another , the planes touched down on the great flat expanse of the airport in the Azores . Phil Kramer , a New York accountant , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carried two pens and a pencil in his breast pocket , was waiting for them . He was a fussy little man , very neat , very organized , and he kept jotting things down in a little notebook . He shook hands with Bernie and Brodsky , jotted down Bernie 's name and address for future reference , and asked about the money . " Safe in the planes . " " You know , it 's not small change . Two million dollars is not small change . It took a lot of crying to come up with two million dollars . " " The money 's safe , " Brodsky assured him . " I see only nine planes . " " Have n't you heard ? We lost one on our way down to Panama . " " Terrible . That 's terrible . What about the crew ? " " We do n't know . " " I 'll try to find out . I 've been here for three days , that 's why I have n't heard . Now I 've made all arrangements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can arrange for something overnight . " " We 've been sleeping in shifts . I think it 's best that we take off as soon as we 're fueled . I do n't know how far the hand of the FBI reaches , 8o THE ESTABLISHMENTbut this was sort of an American field all through the war , was n't it ? " Bernie could not shake off his uneasiness . " It 's Portuguese now . Do n't worry about that . I 've spread a little vigorish here and there , " Kramer told him . " The fuel is paid for , and I 've made arrangements with the restaurant for the food . Just let your boys fill up with whatever they want . Now , does anyone in your gang talk Czech ? " " I doubt it , " Brodsky said . " But our French is good ; Bernie 's is better than mine , but I get along with it . They 've got to speak French . " " Probably . The point is , you have to bargain with them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He reached into his pocket and took out a small thirty-eight-caliber revolver , which he handled gingerly and uncomfortably . " What 's that ? " Bernie asked . " You do n't have any weapons , do you ? " They shook their heads . " With two million in cash , we thought you ought to have a weapon . " " That was very thoughtful of you , " Bernie agreed , grinning . " Very thoughtful indeed . " He put the revolver in his jacket pocket . " But I do n't think there 's anything to worry about . One suitcase is with me and the other 's with Brodsky . There 's nowhere to go in an airplane . " When they took off , four hours later , Bernie saw Kramer standing in front of the airport building , jotting entries in his little notebook . " But you know , " Shlemsky said , " he was right , Bernie . When you think of guys sticking up gas stations for fifty bucks , you got to admit that a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wild guys on this flight . " " Like killing someone , " Bernie said . " You have to do it on the spur of the moment or think about it a long time . The same with this money . No one came into this to steal a million or two , and we 're movingtoo quickly for anyone to figure out how to do it . " It was dusk as they crossed over into Czech airspace and received instructions to put down at a military airfield near Pilsen . The runway was lit as they landed , and a man in uniform , standing in a jeep and shouting at them in French , signaled for the planes to follow his car to a parking area . The sight of a hundred or so soldiers around the parking area made Bernie nervous . Brodsky had assured him that there would be Haganah men waiting when they put down in Czechoslovakia , but when he finally dropped out of the plane , spotlights blinding him , he felt a knot of fear in his stomach . He had heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go on behind the so-called Iron Curtain , and now it occurred to him how simple it would be for them to impound the planes and the money . He tightened his grip on the suitcase . Brodsky was shouting to him . Soldiers with submachine guns pressed toward him , and the pilots , navigators , and radiomen were gathering in a cluster around him , blinking , shading their eyes from the lights , very nervous now that they were in the land of the enemy  --  or what might be the enemy . Then Brodsky reached him , clinging , like Bernie , to a suitcase containing a million dollars . Behind him were two stocky men in leather jackets . " What the devil is it ? " Bernie demanded . " It 's all right . " Two uniformed Czechoslovak officers joined the group . " They 're in the middle of a revolution of some kind , " Brodsky whispered to Bernie . " I do n't know exactly what 's going on , but they 're suspiciousas hell . " One of the Czech officers was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the planes . " " Go ahead , " Bernie told them . " They 're empty . " " We shall see . " They shouted a string of commands , and some of the soldiers took off toward the parked planes . Meanwhile , one of the two men in leather jackets said to Bernie , " That 's the money , in the portmanteaus ? " He had a heavy accent . Brodsky introduced him as Dov Benash . The other was Zvi Kober . " They 're Haganah men , " Brodsky explained . " We meet you here , yes , " Benash said . " We take the money . " " We 'll hold onto the money for the time being , " Bernie said . Kober 's English was better , his accent British . " Will you tell this bloke who we are , Brodsky ? " " His name 's Cohen , Bernie Cohen , " Brodsky told Kober . " He 's runningthe operation , not me . I think he 's right . We 'll hold the money until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Do n't you trust us ? " " I would n't trust my own mother with two million dollars . Do n't worry . We intend to stay close . Everyone stay close ! " he shouted to the pilots . Evidently the Czech officers did not understand English . They were listening and watching . Bernie identified himself . " I understand this was all prearranged , " he said to them , speaking French . " You were expectingus. " 82 THE ESTABLISHMENTThe Czech officer nodded coldly . " My men are hungry and tired . They need food and they need a place to sleep . This is Irving Brodsky . My name is Bernie Cohen . We 're also cold and hungry and tired . Is n't there a place where we can sit down and talk ? " Kober said to him in French , " Get off your high horse , Cohen . " Then he said to the officer , " Can we go to the lounge , colonel ? You 're not the only one who 's suspicious . He 's suspicious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're ready to do business . And if you can find some food for these boys , we 'd appreciate it . " Then he asked in English , " Got any money , Cohen ? American ? " " How much ? " " Twenty 'll be enough . " Bernie took out his wallet and handed Kober a twenty-dollar bill . The Czech officer was watching intently , as was his companion . " They come cheap , " Brodsky whispered . Kober palmed the bill and then shook hands with the Czech . It was utterly transparent , and the men from the flight , watching , began to grin . " Let 's get to the lounge , " Kober said . " Look , Cohen , you got to trust Dov and me . We 're all you got here . " He dropped his voice . " Never mind those two clowns . They 're nothing . " He led the group of men across the field . " I do n't know you either . There were supposed to be ten planes . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one at sea . " " Rotten luck . " They walked the whole length of the field . The lounge , as they called it , reminded Bernie of a cheap highway lunchroom . Beyond it loomed the hulks of factory buildings . " Skoda Works , " Kober explained . " This is a very tense moment . I think the communists have taken over . Either that or it 's in process . Bend ' position is very shaky , and no one wants to go out on a limb . I 'm not even sure whether our deal is on or off because , the money aside , this is one cold nest of anti-Semitic bastards . " " Nobody hates two million dollars . " " Cohen , they got the two million . We 're here , and that money is sittingright here in Pilsen . They have us by the short hair , and do n't you forget that . " A file of soldiers had accompanied them to the lounge and remained outside . Except for themselves , the room was empty . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cohen , we 're starved . " " What 's with those goons outside ? " " Do we eat or do n't we ? " " Where do we stay ? " " What gives , are we under arrest ? " " I guess twenty 's not enough , " Kober said . Bernie took out forty dollars , which Kober gave to Benash , who left the lounge . A half-hour later , he returned with two soldiers , who carried a case of bottled beer and a basket filled with bread and sausage . Bernie , Brodsky , and Goodman sat at one of the tables with the two Haganah men . The sausage was hard , the bread stale , and the beer warm , but they were hungry enough to overlook the quality of the food . " What do we do ? " Bernie asked Kober . " Sit and wait ? " " That 's right . We wait . They know we 're here . " " What about sleeping ? " " God knows . At least this bloody shack is warm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a toilet out back , so your guys have the conven-ience . " " And who are we dealing with ? The army ? " " We are not sure , " Benash said . " Is hard to say . Maybe army , maybe Communist Party , maybe secret police . " " You must have made the deal with someone , " Bernie insisted . " There 's a sleazy chap called Lovazch , " Kober told them . " He 's got a finger in a lot of things . He 's a civilian , but the colonels hop to attentionwhen he speaks . Which makes me think that perhaps he 's party , commissar or something of the sort . The army 's in on it , because this is a military airport attached to the Skoda Works , which have been taken over by the government . We got to him through Max Selnik , who 's a French filmmaker with a lot of contracts in curious places . Max is Jewish , so he went to the trouble of setting this up . The Haganah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be the biggest deal we 've had a go at . Brodsky tells me , " he said to Bernie , " that you 're a weaponsexpert . " " I 've used them . I fought in Spain and then I did six years in the British army . " " Are you a commie ? " " I 'm afraid not . " " Pity . They might listen better to one of their own . Do you know the German weapons ? " " A bit . Not a damn thing about Czech guns . " 84 THE ESTABLISHMENT " Do n't worry . They wo n't sell us any Czech guns . They 'll want to palm off the German junk they picked up after the war . " " It 's not all junk , " Bernie said . " Not if it 's in decent condition . " " Can you be the judge of that ? " ' With the weapons , yes . Not with the Messerschmitts . " " Dov 's a mechanic . That 's his game . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Small arms , rifles , machine guns . And mortars . Small field pieces , if we can get any . But I suppose we 'll have to take what they give us  --  if they give us anything . " They had been in the lounge for almost three hours before anyone appeared to remember they were there . Most of the men were stretched out on the floor . Some were asleep . A few played cards . A few were still chewing on what remained of the sausage and bread . Most of the men who were awake were smoking , and the small room was heavy with cigarette smoke . A counter across one end of the room had a curious baroquemirror behind it . Evidently it had once been used as a lunchroom or barroom of some sort ; on the wall behind the counter were a number of cardboard signs with words and prices printed on them . There were four tables in the room . At three of them , poker games were in progress . Bernie , Brodsky , Goodman , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the table , each between two sensitive feet . Bernie , half-dozing , was listening to Kober 's description of the political situation in Czechoslovakia . There were rumors that Jan Masaryk , the foreign minister , had been murdered by the radicalleft only two days before . " The story is , " said Kober , " that he fell from his window in the Czernin Palace . Bloody clumsy of him , if one is to believe it . I do n't . They 've been arresting members of the government in the opposition parties right and left  --  that is , the left is socking it to the right , and the situation appears to be on the edge of a communisttakeover . None of our concern . Ours is to get the bloody planes and weapons and get out of here . " That was when Bernie saw the two men come into the room . One was a very fat man in civilian clothes . His pink , perspiring face sat in collars of fat , and even as he entered , he was wiping his brow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and a curious cupid mouth . He wore a gray suit , white shirt , and black tie , and a black armband was sewn on his sleeve . " That 's Lovazch , " Kober whispered . " The armband 's for Masaryk . Kinky sense of humor they have . He 's a shrewd pig . " The other wore a uniform with three rows of medals on his breast ; he was a tall , GAMES 85gray-haired , military type who walked stiffly and held his spine erect . " Do n't know him , " Kober said . Lovazch , spotting Kober and Benash , led the officer across the room to their table . Bernie preempted two chairs from the nearest poker game , and Al Levine , a pilot , wailed , " For Christ 's sake , Cohen , you want me to deal the motherfuckin ' cards standing ? " " Can it , " he whispered . " This is the brass we 've been waiting for . " Lovazch bowed stiffly as Kober introduced Cohen , Brodsky , and Goodman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , speaking English with a heavy accent . Then he spoke to the general in Czech . Bernie caught the names of all five of them and the word Haganah . " Cohen here , and Brodsky  --  both of them speak French , " Kober said . " We talk in English , so ? The general do n't speak French . " " Please sit down , " Bernie said . " So ? Thank you . " They seated themselves . " You have money ? " " We have money , " Kober said . " How much ? " " Two million , American . " " Where ? " " Let that rest for a while , " Kober said . " Oh ? Please  --  do n't give me shit , like you say . Either show me money or I walk out . " They looked at each other . " Show him the money , " Bernie said . " What 's the difference ? " Kober shrugged . Benash nodded . He had a face like a hawk , brown and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Unless I 've forgotten all I used to know about men like him , " Bernie said to himself , " he has a gun in his pocket and his finger on the trigger . He 's a killer , and like all killers , a little crazy . He 'd like nothing better than to put a bulletinto Lovazch , and that would be just dandy . " Aloud , Bernie said , " I am in command of this operation , Mr. Lovazch . " Kober and Benash glanced at him , surprised . They remained silent . " May I first express my gratitude to the great people 's democracy of Czechoslovakia , and of course to you . The money is nothing . It is merely a symbol . The struggle for liberty is everything . " He smiled and nodded and reached under the table for the suitcase . Brodsky followed his action , and they placed the two suitcases on the table . Neither had been opened since Feinstein had turned them over . The thought occurredto Bernie that conceivably neither suitcase contained any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be trusted ? How many before86 THE ESTABLISHMENT GAMES 87Feinstein ? What strange force held them all together in this ? He had never really believed that anything superseded human greed , but evidentlythe will to create something on a parched piece of desert on the Mediterranean took precedence even over greed . He met Iry Brodsky 's eyes . Brodsky 's thin smile suggested that perhaps he had the same thoughts . Curiously , the luggage was not even locked , only held together with snaps and leather straps . He and Brodsky undid the fastenings , and the others around the table rose as they opened the suitcases . Both were packed with tight bundles of hundred- and five-hundreddollarbills . As if possessing a dynamic force of its own , the money communicated itself . The poker games stopped , and the chatter of voices in the room stopped too , and slowly and silently the whole group of airmengathered around the table . With awe and respect , someone said , " Holy shit ! " It expressed it completely , Bernie thought . " All right , guys , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! You all seen a dollar before . Forget it . We have business to do . " They moved away , slowly , reluctantly , as Bernie closed the suitcases . " Do you want to count it ? " he asked Lovazch . The fat man wiped his brow . " Not necessary . " He took out a notebook . " You pay as we decided each purchase . " " Nothing doing ! " Kober said curtly . " Is n't it simpler , " Bernie said , " to make the payment when the goods are loaded ? " " You must trust me , " Lovazch said . " I trust you , you trust me . " " When the goods are loaded . " " You are making it difficult for me . Do you not know , Mr. Cohen , that you are in Czechoslovakia at very trying time ? You must not press me too hard . It is within my authority to impound your planes and your money . That would be unfortunate , no ? " They sat in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he and his friends have a few words . " Of course , " Lovazch agreed . " Of course . " The five of them went across the room and put their heads together . " We had a deal , " Kober whispered . " Forget it , " Bernie told him . " He 's going to skim the cash , he and that sonofabitch general . Suppose we told him to fuck off ? Is there any kind of appeal here , any straight people you can do business with ? " " Are you kidding ? " " The question is , " Brodsky whispered , " will he deliver ? " " Oh , yes , he 'll deliver , at his own bloody price . He has us , we have him . I say , pay his price and let 's get to hell out of here . If we insist on paying when they load , that cuts him out , and that fat bastard is n't going to see himself cut out . " They returned to the table . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I see , Cohen , you are a man of sensibility . Then we begin with the Messerschmitts . Ten planes . " " The planes are disassembled and ready to load , " said Kober . " But we can only take nine . We lost one of our transports in flight . " " You agreed to ten , you pay for ten . " " We ca n't take ten , " Bernie put in . " God Almighty , you have a handful of people there in Palestine who 'll be fighting for their lives any day now . Every dollar we have here means something . " " Please not to invoke God . You contracted for ten planes , you pay for ten , sixty thousand each , all together , dollars six hundred thousand . " " The price was fifty thousand ! " Brodsky exclaimed . " So price changes . " " What is it , Mr. Lovazch ? Are you determined to have your pound of flesh ? " " Ah , Shakespeare . Merchant of Venice . I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Youish . " You are Jewish . You will have your pound of flesh , but not from me . Oh , no . I do not bargain . Very Jewish , bargaining . We offer you life and you bargain . " He pursed his little cupid-bow mouth and made a sour face . " Disgusting . No more bargaining or I walk out of here and tell you and your Jews to go to hell . Do you understand me ? " Bernie nodded . Benash 's face became even colder and tighter . Kober was smiling pleasantly . Bernie whispered to Kober , who sat beside him , speaking an inadequate Hebrew , " No trouble from Benash , please . " Still smiling , Kober said to Benash in Hebrew , " If you do something crazy , Dov , I 'll kill you , I swear . " " I only have a gun , " Benash replied in Hebrew . " If I had a knife , I 'd cut that fat pig 's heart out . " " You will speak in English , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Bernie agreed . " We accept the price . " " Then the money , " Lovazch said , making marks in his notebook . " Now ? " " Of course , now . We make a deal , money passes hands . " " Irv , " Bernie said , " count out six hundred thousand . " 88 THE ESTABLISHMENT Brodsky counted out the money . The very fact of the enormous sum of money changing hands brought the listening airmen to their feet . Now they moved closer to the table . Lovazch consulted his notebook . " I have Russian rifles , very good , three thousand , two hundred twenty . " " No Russian guns , " Bernie said flatly . " I hear you have German guns . " " Russian guns are excellent . " " Close that goddamn suitcase , Irv , " he shouted at Brodsky . " The hell with it ! We came to do business , not to be robbed ! You can take this money from us , but you 'll have one hell of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If you think you can kill or jail thirty American citi- zens and get away with it , Lovazch , then go ahead and try ! You 're going to load those nine Messerschmitts and we 're going to take off  --  and you just try to stop us ! " His voice had climbed to a snarling roar , and Brodsky and Goodman were staring at him in amazement . Kober was smiling , and for the first time , Benash 's lips parted in a thin smile . The airmen were grinning with pleasure . Lovazch spread his hands . " Who is talking of robbing ? " The general was speaking in Czech . Lovazch answered him , and for a few minutes they held a dialogue . Then Lovazch said again , " Who talks of robbing ? I suggest Russian weapons . The Red army is the greatest army in the world . You think they fight with pitchforks ? You want German guns ? Fine . We talk about German guns . What do you want ? " " Volksturm Geschuss , " Bernie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mausers ? I sell you five thou- sand Mausers . " " What the devil is a Volksturm Geschuss ? " Kober asked . " Light carbine type . Nine and a half pounds . Forty-four caliber , and takes a magazine of thirty rounds . It 's a hell of a weapon . That 's what I want , " he told Lovazch . " Cost you , Mr. Cohen . It will cost you . " He consulted his notebook . " Two hundred we sell , no more . A hundred dollars each . " Bernie nodded at Brodsky , who counted out twenty thousand dollars . " Ammunition ? " " Sixty rounds for each gun . " " We need more  --  double that , at least . " Again , Brodsky counted out money . " I want Schmeizers , " Bernie said . GAMES 89 " Schmeizers , Schmeizersl " Lovazch exclaimed . " Ask me for dia-monds ! " Brodsky nudged him . " Machine pistols , " Bernie said . " The damnedestweapon that was ever made . Seven hundred and fifty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Lovazch . " Schluss . No Schmeizers . " " Why not ? " " You pay a thousand dollars each , yes ? " Kober shook his head . " Buy the Mausers , " he whispered to Bernie . The bargaining went on for another hour . Twenty-two MG-42 light machine guns , the five thousand Mauser rifles , an assortment of Luger pistols . The money was heaped in front of Lovazch and the general . The general could not keep his eyes off it . He sat with his cold gaze fixed on the piles of American dollars . " I want fifty thousand dollars ' bond , " Lovazch said finally , " for airportprivileges , fuel , loading . " " Fifty thousand dollars ! " Brodsky exclaimed . " How do you say ? " Lovazch smiled . " A pound of flesh , yes . We will load the planes tonight . You are to take off at dawn . You will tell your Jews in Palestine that we are good businessmen too . Because we are Marxists , it does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general was putting the money back into the suitcases as Lovazch spoke . He had a penchant for neatness . He piled the bundles of bills carefully , caressing them with his long , thin , carefully manicured fingers . " I do not press you , " Lovazch continued . " Our country is in a state of revolution . I am a friend of the Jews . Others are not . So the sooner you get out o f here , the better for you . " " When will you start loading ? " Bernie asked . " In an hour . " " We want to check what you load . " " You do n't trust me ? " " That 's two million dollars , " Bernie said . " We want to check the loading . " He shrugged . " As you wish . " He and the general rose , each picking up a suitcase . Lovazch smiled and nodded . " As you wish . I see you at the planes . " They turned and marched out of the room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left , then came an outburst from the airmen , a barrage of curses and epithets until Bernie was forced to shout , " Will you all knock it off ! " " We 've been had ! " someone yelled 90 THE ESTABLISHMENT " Maybe yes , maybe no . I want you to try to sleep . If we 're taking off at dawn , you 've got to get some sleep . " " Where ? On the floor ? " " On the floor . That 's right . We never promised you a picnic . If today was bad , tomorrow will be worse . So get some sleep . And keep it down . If you ca n't sleep , maybe the next guy can . " Kober was humming to the tune of " I 've got sixpence , lucky , lucky sixpence . " Benash had taken a Colt forty-five out of his jacket pocket , and now he was checking the cylinder . " Going to shoot your way out ? " Bernie asked him . " Maybe . " " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think they 'll deliver and load the planes , " Bernie said . " He wants us out of here in the morning because he 's taken us like Grant took Richmond . But there 's not a damn thing we can do about it except try to check him as he loads . " " You 're an optimist , " Kober observed . " No . Look , Kober , he 's running a scam . I do n't know who else is in on it besides the general , but it stands to reason that if we make a fuss or if he does , it 's going to louse up his take . We paid double for everything , but we still got a hell of a lot of stuff , and we got the nine Messerschmitts . " " If he delivers . " " We 'll see . " He turned to Goodman . " You get some sleep , Herb . You 're a navigator . The four of us , we 're just passengers , so we 'll check the loading . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Benash put the gun back in his pocket . The four of them left the lounge and walked across the field . The place where the planes were parked was lit with portable lights . Two trucks , loaded with parts of the disassembled Messerschmitts , were already backing into the area . There were at least a hundred men there , half of them in uniform , the others in work clothes . " Well , " Kober said , " it looks like our Lovazch is a man of his word . " " That dirty anti-Semitic bastard , " Brodsky said . " A fine way to show your gratitude . " Lovazch appeared a few minutes later , and the loading went on almostuntil dawn . Kober and Benash remained with the planes . Bernie and Brodsky made their way back across the field to the lounge . It was predawn , a gloomy gray under a clouded sky that began to drizzleGAMES 91lightly . The airmen , unshaven and aching from their night on the floor , were ill-tempered and bitter . " Come on , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be in sunshine tomorrow . Soft beds , decent food , and you can spend the day lying on the beach . " They filed back across the field through the rain . Sitting in the copilot'sseat , next to Al Shlemsky , Bernie managed to stay awake through the takeoff . A few minutes later , even before they broke through the clouds into the sun-drenched sky , he was asleep . He did n't wake up until they were making their approach to the airport outside Tel Aviv . The same day she received a cable from Bernie , informing her of his safe arrival in Tel Aviv , Barbara had lunch with Jean at Jack 's on Sacramento Street . The wire from Bernie , in the few words it contained , fairly bubbled with satisfaction . " A great story for you and for Dan too . Kiss him for me . Back soon , and never another gripe about being a grease monkey . " But no word as to when , precisely , he would be back . That day , also , Barbara had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Layette Foundation and an afternoon session with HarveyBaxter , her lawyer . Barbara was first at the restaurant , and when Jean entered , Barbara did not have to inquire about Dan . Jean was her old self , statuesque in a pearl gray Chanel suit of French mohair , her blouse a blue that matched both her eyes and the lining of her jacket . " Of course , daddy 's much better , " Barbara said . And Jean agreed . " His old self . He pleaded with me to smuggle in a cigar . I told him he 'd have to give them up forever , and he repeated that stupid , disgusting bit about a woman is just a woman , but a good cigar is a smoke . He began as a hoodlum kid from the Tenderloin , and he 's reverted . Perhaps it 's lying in bed that makes him so tough . If men were n't so totally pathetic I could very easily despise them all . What on earth is that you 're wearing , Bobby ? " " Just what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a skirt . " Jean shook her head . " The sweater is practically falling apart , andthat skirt is ancient . Will you ever learn to dress properly ? " " I doubt it . Do you want a drink ? " " I do . I want a stiff martini . I want to celebrate that I am not a widow , a hideous state . What have you heard from Bernie ? " " I do love the way your mind moves . I had a cable from Tel Aviv. 92 THE ESTABLISHMENT GAMES 93He got there safely with the nine planes , mission accomplished . If one can judge from a cable , he 's high as a kite . " " Then we 'll both have a drink and celebrate . You know , he is a remarkable man . How did you ever come to meet him , Bobby ? You were never very clear on that . " " Did n't I tell you ? " She paused to order the drinks . " No , I do n't suppose I ever did tell you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one 's mother . " " I do n't know what you could possibly tell me that would shock me . It 's the illusion of each generation that the previous one lived in a kind of childish innocence . Of course there are innocents in every generation , but I was not one of them . By the way , I saw Tom yesterday and told him about Dan 's heart attack . I think it touched him . " Barbara doubted that . It was not difficult for her to follow her mother 's train of thought . It was easier to have a homosexual brother than a homosexual son . " He 's getting married , you know , " Jean said . " I did n't know . " Barbara hesitated . There were things one could not discuss with one 's mother . " Lucy Sommers , I suppose . " " How did you know ? " " They 've been around together . Do you know , " she said after a moment , " I can forgive Tom most things , but not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  well , that 's unforgivable . " " It takes two , and Dan has n't helped . " The waiter came , and they were occupied ordering food ; Jean tried to recall where the conversation had started . " You were asking me how I met Bernie . Of course I can tell you . I ca n't believe I never did , but I was a good deal younger then . You know he worked for the Levys at the winery  --  " " No , I did n't know that . " " Long ago . Nineteen twenty-two or twenty-three . He was just a kid then . He kept in touch with them , and eventually he joined the AbrahamLincoln Brigade . He always had his own strange reasons for what he did . He went to work at the winery to learn to grow grapes , because he believed that one day he would grow grapes in Palestine . He was an orphan who created his own dream place where everything that had been wrong in his life would be put right . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be his life in Palestine . He joined the brigade to learn how to fight . When the Levys wrote to me that they would be coming to Paris , they mentioned that Bernie was inthe Lincoln Brigade . Of course , I had n't met him then . It was just a name . But when Marcel , this French journalist I was in love with , was assigned by his paper to go to Spain and do a story on the Lincoln Brigade , I mentioned Bernie 's name to him . Just as a contact . He found Bernie , and when the terrible retreat across the Ebro took place , Bernie saved his life  --  he swam the Ebro with him and practically carried him on his back for miles . Marcel wrote all this to me in a letter from the hospital in Toulouse . Before he died , " Barbara finished slowly . " I do n't think I ever told you that either . His leg was badly mangled , and he would n't let them amputate until I got to Toulouse . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He died of gangrene . " " You do n't have to talk about it . " " I do n't mind . I can talk about it now . Marcel was a beautiful man . Quite ugly , with a long bony face , but very beautiful . I never met anyone else like him . He was full of joy , and it was always joyful to be around him . He picked me up on the Champs-Elysees , saw me and followed me and insisted that if I walked out of his life , he would be utterlydevastated . Well , that was only the beginning . We were together for a long time , and we were to be married . But I think you knew that ? " " I knew it , " Jean said softly . " So different from Bernie . That 's odd , is n't it ? But you wanted to know about Bernie . Well , it was months later . The Spanish Civil War was over , and the international brigades were disbanded . Bernie walked over the Pyrenees into France @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hitched his way to Paris . To see Marcel , strangely enough . You see , Marcel had talked of nothing else but this wonderful American girl he was going to marry . Bernie did n't know he had died , and since Marcel was the only person in Paris he knew , he went to the offices of Le Monde , where Marcel had worked . They told him about Marcel and gave him my address . And there you have it . My doorbell rang , and when I opened the door , there was this enormous , hulking brute of a man , in a sweat shirt and blue jeans , with two days ' beard on his face . Well , we talked , I took him to dinner , and then he came home with me and used my shower and shaved , and I washed his very dirty clothes , and then we went to bed . And that 's it . I think I fell a little bit in love with him the moment I saw him at my door , so woeful and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desperate need to love someoneand to be loved by someone , or maybe he was all that remained of Marcel , or maybe his saving Marcel 's life joined him to me in some94 THE ESTABLISHMENTway . He was so gentle and so kind . God , I needed someone to be gentle and kind to me . But that 's it . That 's how I met Bernie Cohen . " The waiter brought their food . Jean toyed with hers . It occurred to Barbara that she had never actually seen Jean eat , certainly not with the gusto and pleasure that food brought to so many people . But that perhaps was the reason for her mother 's slender figure , for the smooth , tightly drawn skin that covered the bones of her face . " I was never clear about how long he was with you then , " Jean said . " He was gone the next morning . Before I woke up . Left a note that he was broke , he loved me , and he did n't intend to sponge off me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned up here one day more than six years later . He got to Palestine , where he joined the British army . Six years of it . " " And you still loved him ? " Jean asked . " No , I loved a romantic dream I had . But then I got to know him . He 's not hard to know . He 's rather simple and very direct . And also terriblycomplicated . Not an intellectual ; his complication is different . " Jean nodded . " I wish you would eat something . I wish you would n't sit there and just cut up your food . I 'm hungry , and watching you fills me with guilt . Was I a fat child ? " " You never were . I hardly ever eat at lunch , Bobby . " " There 's a fat , guilty child somewhere inside of me . Have you ever seen a psychiatrist , mother ? I mean , have you ever been psycho-analyzed ? " " What on earth ever gave you that idea ? No . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being highly personal , are n't we ? I was only thinking of how much you 've changed . " " Have I ? I do n't know . I 've always been the spoiled daughter of a very rich man . When all that was going on in Spain , I had only the vaguest notion of what was happening . I was always concerned for myself . Even during the war , I was hardly involved . " " Yet you can say that . " " What ? " " I mean , you look at yourself . Whether you 're right or wrong about what you are , you 're making the judgment . " " Is that a virtue ? " " I do n't know , " Barbara said uneasily . " I keep trying to look at myself , but I ca n't get away from it . From me . As if something is missing from us . I keep asking myself , will I grow up and when ? " GAMES 95 " You 're very grown up , " Jean told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " That 's a lovely illusion . I think it 's remarkable to fool one 's own mother . We 're both of us the spoiled daughters of very rich men . Only you seem to have made your peace with it . I 'm afraid I have n't . " Iry Brodsky pleaded with Bernie to remain in Palestine and join the Haganah . " You do n't know how much we need you . Since the UN declaration , the Arabs have gone mad , and the British are n't doing one damn thing about it . Just hands off and get ready to leave . They 've killed more Jews in the past few months than in the past twenty years . Bernie , we prepared for this , both of us . There are n't ten men in Palestinewho know what you do about tactics and modern war . How in hell can you walk out ? How can you walk away from it ? You remember Hyam Kadar ? " Bernie remembered the name vaguely , a slight , dark boy with curly black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in thirty-nine . He was killed three days ago . He was with a convoy trying to break through to Jerusalem . The Arabs put a log blockade across the gorge below Bab el-Wad , and then they slaughtered them . Maybe three thousand Arabs and a handfulof our guys . And that 's every day . How in hell can you walk away from it ? " " I was never in it , " Bernie said . " I 'm not in it now . I 'll be forty-two next birthday . I 'm a middle-aged garage operator from San Francisco . I 'm married . I have a wonderful wife who is n't Jewish and who puts up with my insanity for reasons beyond my understanding . At this point , I do n't even know exactly how I got into this . I guess I could n't face the thought of spending the next ten years running a garage . But I paid my dues . I got up the money for the planes , and I stayed with it . I 'm done . I got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had enough of war to fill my gut . " He and Brodsky and a woman called Lena Polda were sitting at a table in an outdoor cafe on Dizengoff in Tel Aviv . The sun was shining . The air was warm and gentle . Men in shirtsleeves and women in summer dresses walked by . Children played in the street . There was no sound of war , of guns firing . Lena Polda was a dark , intense woman in her middle twenties . She was a fourth or fifth cousin to Brodsky and worked as a bookkeeper in Tel Aviv . Brodsky 's mother , who still lived on the Grand Concourse in the Bronx in New York , had telephoned96 THE ESTABLISHMENTher to find out whether her son was alive or dead ; surprisingly , she had gotten through , something of a miracle in Palestine in March of 1948 . Lena had gone to the airfield and was there when the nine planes landed ; two days later , she met them for lunch , and until now she had said very little . Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ born in Poland , in Vilna , put in a concentration camp by the Nazis when she was seventeen , watched her mother and father , in the same concentration camp , go to the gas chamber , and had then been used as a prostitute by the camp officers . She had survived and had come to Palestine in 1945 . Now , somewhat unexpectedly , she said to Bernie , " What dues have you paid , if I understand you , Mr. Cohen , if dues are like , like an obligation ? " It was her first contribution to the conversation . " More or less . It 's just an expression . " " So tell me . " " What Bernie meant , " said Brodsky , " is that he fought in two wars , in the Spanish war and in the last war . " " Oh ? " She stretched out her hand to reveal the number tattooed on her forearm . " So . Have I paid my dues ? " Bernie nodded slowly . " Should I go home ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my home . " " No ? No , I am sure not . " She rose . " I must go back to work . Thank you for the lunch . " After she had left , Brodsky said , " Do n't let that get under your skin . She 's strange . They all are after they 've been in the camps . " They sat in an uneasy silence for a while . Then Bernie said , " It 's funny , but when I was a kid , all I ever dreamed about was coming here . I hated Hitler , but I did n't join the brigade because I was antifascist . I joined to train for this , and even when we got here first in thirty-nine , it was Home is the sailor , home from the sea . ' And now all I want is to get back with Barbara and the kid . I can understand the way Lena feels . It 's not the way I feel , so it 's no use arguing with me , Irv . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You ca n't get a plane out of here this week . It 's impossible . " " I know . I booked passage on a ship out of Haifa for Naples . I can get a flight from Naples to London , and from there home . " " When ? " " Three days from now . " " All right . Look , we 're driving up to Haifa . They 're dropping me offGAMES 97at the old kibbutz , so come along , and you can spend an hour at the place and see all the improvements , and then get to Haifa in plenty of time . " " Who are they ? Who 's driving you up there ? " " Dov Benash and Zvi Kober . They 're both attached to a Haganah unit up there . They 're leaving tomorrow morning . " Waking the following day in the small room he shared with Brodsky in the rickety stucco house on Allenby Road that called itself the Hotel Shalom , Bernie had a momentary difficulty recalling where he was . The room was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and some twist of memory flung him back to the months he had spent in North Africa . He had a moment of panic ; life and time reversed itself , and for that moment all of his life with Barbara was a dream . Still not fully awake , he moaned in agony . " Are you all right ? " Brodsky called out . He was at the sink , shaving . " Yeah , I 'm all right . " Too much had happened too quickly . It was like a dream  --  the airfields in Kansas and New Jersey , the airfield in Panama , the airfield in the Azores , the fat Czech , Lovazch , cheating them on the price of the guns , and then the end , so flat , so unemotional , a man called Yigal Allon , tall , slender , blond , youthfully aloof , shaking his hand in an almostnoncommittal manner , " Good work , Cohen , " and then seeming indifferent , as if it were a perfectly ordinary and expected thing that a man in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ten thousand dollars to buy ten old airplanes , and that he , Bernie Cohen , should direct their flight across half the world and bring them into Palestine loaded with guns and Messerschmitts . But it fitted in with the rest of it . Where else in time or place would two million dollarspacked in two suitcases be treated in such a manner , as if the suitcasesheld shirts and pants and coats ? There was a convulsive thing of the spirit happening here , and it reached out to touch people in every corner of the earth , and for a day or a week it changed them , the way he had been changed , or perhaps regressed to adolescence and catapultedoff in search of romance and all the golden dreams of youth . But now he felt used up and let down . His necessity to the adventure was of his own invention . It was true that Brodsky had pleaded with him to head up the operation , but he could have refused , and Brodsky could have carried it off just as well . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Palmach , the front-line striking force of this tiny , desperate nation that would soon be fighting for its very exist-98 THE ESTABLISHMENTence ? That Allon would embrace him and make a speech , declaring that they had been rescued by Cohen the savior ? " Are you sure you 're all right ? " Brodsky asked . " Better get your ass out of bed , because they said they 'd be downstairs at seven , and it 's almostseven-thirty now . " He dressed and shaved and packed the flight bag that contained two shirts , both of them dirty now , underwear , and socks . Brodsky saw him pause , holding the revolver that Kramer , the accountant , had given him in the Azores . Then he handed it to Brodsky . " What 's this ? " " Kramer gave it to me . The little guy who met us in the Azores . He felt the money needed protection . I have no use for it . Out here , any weapon 's something . " Brodsky put the gun in his pocket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bill , Bernie went outside . The jeep was parked in front of the hotel , and Benash and Kober sat in the front seat , eating fried fish out of a greasy paper bag and breaking pieces off a loaf of bread . " Have some , " Kober said . " Fish and chips without the chips . Not as good as London , but quite worthy . The bread is first rate . " Bernie reached into the bag , and Benash tore off a piece of bread for him . With his first bite , he realized he was ravenously hungry . " Enough for all , " Kober said . The fish was cold but good . Brodsky came out of the hotel and joined them and accepted fish and bread . Bernie pointed to four wooden boxes in the jeep . " Our share of the boodle , " Kober said . " Forty Mausers and two cases of ammunition . We deliver it to Haifa . We may have a bit of trouble along the road , so I suggest you both take guns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two rifles in front and a pistol in his belt . " That case is open . " They started off , Kober driving , Bernie and Brodsky in the back seat . The Mausers were thick with grease . Bernie took a T-shirt out of his bag , and he and Brodsky wiped the guns and loaded them . They drove north along the coastal road , turned inland at Natanya , and continued north to Hadera . So far , the day had been peaceful beyondbelief . They did not even encounter a British patrol ; the only signs of war were three burned-out trucks on the wayside . To the east , the hills were still hazy in the morning mist . Men and women working the fields with guns slung across their shoulders waved to them , and burnoosed Arabs tended their goats and sheep , lazily indifferent . TheGAMES 99whole aspect of the land , so calm , so peaceful in the sunshine , filled Bernie with a sense of deja vu , a feeling that he had never left this strange , haunting place . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it became timeless . They stopped at Hadera for lunch , then they turned northeast on the dirt-surfaced road that led through the foothills of Carmel to Nazareth . From where they crossed the rail line it was no more than fifteen miles to Kibbutz Benyuseff , where both Brodsky and Bernie had worked in 1939 , and where Brodsky had lived since then . In 1942 , Brodsky had been briefly married ; a month later , his wife was killed by an Arab sniper , and he had not married again . He spoke about it now for the first time . " She said once , " he told Bernie , " that she knew you like an old friend . Just from what I had told her . We talked about you a lot . She was sure she 'd meet you one day . Well , that 's the way it goes . Anyway , you wo n't recognize the place . Two hundred orange trees , seventy acres of wheat and barley . And cows , we got over forty cows . Nursery , school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you believe it  --  Iry Brodsky , Grand Concourse and One Hundred and Sixty-third Street in the Bronx , the agronomist ? They sent me to school in Tel Aviv for six months , but mostly I get it out of books . Sit up half the night reading Weber and Batchelor . " " Who are Weber and Batchelor ? " " Top experts on citrus growing , from your part of the world , Cali-fornia . " " And what , pray , is the Grand Concourse , old chap ? " Kober asked him . " Sounds like one of those debutante affairs they have in the States . " " Just a big , ugly street in the Bronx . " It was slow going after they crossed the railroad . The road was rutted , washed out by the spring rains . At times Kober had to put the jeep into low gear and crawl almost at a walking pace . The countryside had changed to a region of low , rolling hills dotted here and there with Arab villages of mud and stone huts . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jutted out of the stony hillsides . Goats had eaten the vegetation to the roots , and the starkness of the hillsides was relieved only by an occasional olive grove . They passed the ruins of some ancient building , a single pillar jutting from the pile of stone . When they were seen from a village , men , women , and children disappeared into their houses. 100 THE ESTABLISHMENT " I do n't like it , " Brodsky said . He picked up his Mauser , worked the bolt , and checked the load . " Ca n't you go any faster ? " Bernie asked Kober . " Not without wrecking this job . It 's old and venerable . Just keep your eyes peeled for snipers . We 're four of us and armed , so I do n't imagine they 'll try anything rash . How much farther ? " " Ten miles or so . " They did n't hear the shot . A hole with a spider web of cracked glass radiating from it appeared in their windshield . The bullet rang off the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stop . " Why are you stopping ? " They heard the second shot . It whined past , missing the jeep entirely . " Dead ahead , " Benash said . " Eight , nine hundred meters . " He pointed to the hole in the windshield . " Any closer , it would n't crackle , " Bernie agreed . " Rotten shooting . " " They may get better . " He pulled the jeep off the road to the right , lurching into the shelter of a rocky spur of hillside . They heard at least five more shots , only one of which found its mark in the jeep . Then they were sheltered . Kober turned to face Bernie . " Well , old chap , you 're the mavin on tactics . They 're bloody poor shots , but who is n't at eight hundred meters ? That one "  --  he nodded at the windshield  --  " could have taken your head off . Mostly these beggars have old singleshotLee-Enfields or Martinis , so I 'd say there 's at least half a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Every nasty within hearing will come prancing in for the kill . " " Then I 'd say we turn around and head back to that last kibbutz . " " And how do I get home ? " Brodsky demanded . " You come to Haifa with us , " Kober told him . " I 'm glad Cohen is more sensible than heroic . I detest arguments . " He turned the ignition key . Nothing happened . Bernie leaped out of the car and raised the hood . " Oh , Jesus , " he said . A bullet had pierced the radiator and found the battery . The radiator was draining , the lead on the battery shattered . " Can you fix it ? " " Two or three hours , maybe . " " Can we start the damn car ? " " No way . " He looked around . On top of the rise of the hill , about a hundred yards from them , was an Arab herdsman 's shelter , a tiny hut of mud and stone , roofless , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " GAMES 101 " We might beat them back to the kibbutz on foot , " Brodsky speculated . " They 're on foot . It 's a long run , but we 've still got a lead . " " Never ! " Kober snapped . " After that shooting , every beggar with a gun will be out potting at us . All it takes is a couple of gunshots . Trying to make a run for it , we 'd be sitting ducks . " " I do n't leave the guns , " Benash said . " Do what you want ; I do n't give them these guns . " " Then let 's do it , " Bernie said , " before they 're on top of us . " He slung the rifle over his shoulder and hefted one of the boxes of ammunition . It weighed at least a hundred pounds . He picked it up and started off for the hut . The others followed . Brodsky managed the secondbox of ammunition , but it took both Kober and Benash to carry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the jeep . The moment they were out of the shelter of the hill , bullets began to kick up the dust around them . With their load , they could n't quicken their pace , and it was all uphill . Bernie felt that his feet were weighted . An eternity seemed to pass before he had climbed the hundred yards and dropped , panting , inside the ruined hut . The only casualty was Benash . A bullet had torn a shred of flesh from his arm . He protested that it was nothing . Bernie made a bandage of his handkerchief and stopped the flow of blood , then Benash started out of the hut . " Where the devil are you going ? " " Twenty guns left in jeep . " " They 're not eight hundred meters away anymore . Will you use your head and look . " Two Arabs had rounded the fold of the hill , and as Bernie pointed , they saw the jeep and raced toward it . Benash raised his rifle and fired . One of the Arabs dropped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Benash , standing in the doorway of the hut , and flung a wild shot from his gun . Benash fired a second time . The man 's head whipped back and he crumpled to the ground . Benash said something in Hebrew , then snapped at Bernie , " I go get guns now . " " No ! " " Fuck you , Yankee , " Benash said , and he flung himself down the hillside in wild , sure-footed leaps . " God willing , there 's only two of them , " Kober said . The three men crouched in the door of the hut , watching . Benash reached the jeep , loaded himself with the Mausers , and started back up the hillside . Another Arab rounded the protecting fold of the hill. 102 THE ESTABLISHMENTHardly thinking of what he was doing , Bernie raised his rifle and fired . The man fell . Somewhere deep in his mind , the thought raced , I 've killed a man . God help me , I 've killed a man . Stone chips splattered from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flat . Bernie stood there . Now there were Arabs firing from both flanks , and three of them topped the ridge behind which the jeep was sheltered . Benash was about thirty paces from the hut when he was hit . He stumbled for three or four steps , the Mausers falling from his shoulders and leaving a trail behind him ; then he collapsed and fell face down . Bernie raced to him and heaved him up on his shoulder in a single convulsive movement . Leaving the shelter of the hut , picking up Benash , and getting back with him could not have taken half a minute , but to Bernie it felt like an eternity , slow , slow steps back to the hut , where Brodsky and Kober crouched in the doorway , emptying the magazines of their rifles . Bernie felt the shock of bullets against Benash 's body . Benash had been hit twice more , but the first shot , through his body from the side , would have been the fatal one . He was dead when they laid him down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the doorway , maintaining a steady fire through a haze of smoke . " Dov is dead , " Bernie told them . " Poor pigheaded bastard ! " " What the hell are you shooting at ? " he demanded . " Do you see any of them ? " " No . " " Then stop wasting ammunition . " They stopped shooting and rolled out of the doorway into the protection of the walls . " Plenty of ammunition , old chap , " Kober said to him . " It will outlast us , you know . " The hut was roofless , low-walled . Standing erect , Bernie could see over the walls . There were Arabs in the distance , tiny figures . He could count at least thirty of them . " Our own stupidity , " Kober said . " You 're an outsider , but Brodsky and I should have known better . " " I came through here six months ago , " Brodsky remembered . " They were gentle as lambs . " " They 're not very gentle now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Bernie asked him . " In the daylight ? No . Why should they ? They 'll come at night and toss a few grenades . Finis . " GAMES 103 " They have grenades ? " " Oh , yes . Between the Mufti and the British , they 're well supplied . The curse of being Jewish , Cohen . Nobody really likes us . " " Then we have to get out of here before it 's actually dark . I imagine they 'll wait until it 's damn good and dark . " " I 'm beginning to like you , Cohen , " Kober said . " I put you down as just another arrogant bastard . But I must say , I like your style . " He turned to Brodsky . " Cheer up , Irv . The best or the worst is yet to come . Either way , it 'll be a change . And gratefully . Notice the smell in here ? Sheep dip . They gather it and use it for their fires . " " What about poor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't bury him and we ca n't take him with us . Our own chances are so thin , we ca n't even properly weep over him . " " Do you mind if I say the Kaddish for him ? " Brodsky asked bitterly . Regarding him strangely , Kober shook his head . He took his rifle and lay down in the doorway . The Arabs were shooting again . It was late afternoonnow , and the hills cast long , dark shadows . The Arabs were invisiblein the cover of those shadows . There was a velvet quality to the landscape , the hills becoming softly rose where the sun struck them . Bernie closed Benash 's eyes , and Brodsky spread his handkerchief over his face . Bernie felt that they were both thinking the same thing , that the Arabs castrated the Jewish dead , disemboweled them and frequentlycut off their heads . The fierce hawk had fled from Benash . His face in death was like a small boy 's . An occasional bullet struck the doorway , sending chips flying from the stone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Brodsky moved out of the line of the doorway and began to intone the prayer for the dead , swaying slightly , the way Bernie had seen Rabbi Blum sway so many years ago . Rabbi Blum had taken Bernieout of the orphanage and raised him . Rabbi Blum had never killed a living thing , not even an insect . He was an outsider . He lived on earth as an outsider . What was it Kober had said to him only moments before ? " You 're an outsider , Cohen . " Filled with overwhelming sadness , he listened to the Kaddish . It was too late . Everything came too late . " Say ye amen , " Brodsky said in the ancient Aramaic in which the prayer was composed . " Amen , " Bernie whispered . Kober was very still . The firing outside picked up , increased ; it was still at least two hours to sunset. 104 THE ESTABLISHMENT " Show the flag , " Bernie said to Kober , his voice thick and harsh . " Lay down some fire . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brodsky crawled to him , then said to Bernie , " He 's dead . " The bullet was in his forehead . He had died instantly and silently . " They 're all around us , " Brodsky said tonelessly . " There 's no way out of here , Bernie . " With the butt of his rifle , Bernie pounded a stone out of the back wall . " Take the back , " he said to Brodsky . " I 'll take the doorway . Keep up a constant fire . Maybe Kober was right and they wo n't attack until dark . We 'll try to slip away before then . " When Bernie 's Mauser stopped firing , Brodsky listened for it to start again . He was shooting through the loophole Bernie had made , only shooting ; there was nothing to see , only smoke and the deep shadows of twilight . But Bernie 's gun remained quiet . " Oh , my God , " Brodsky whispered . He yelled , " Bernie ! Bernie ! Do n't leave me alone here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quietly in the doorway , and shook him . Then he rose and faced the three Arabs standing in front of the doorway . It took just an instant for the sight of them to register before they fired pointblank , and his body fell across Bernie 's . PART THREEInquisitionThere were those who described Lucy Sommers as an austere person . She was a dark , intense woman of forty years , the only child of Alvin Sommers , once president of the Seldon Bank and now retired at the age of seventy-nine . People have a rhythm in their lives , and some live in their early years and some in their late years . Sommers became presidentof the bank at sixty-five , and at seventy-nine , he was a hard , dry specimen who promised to go on forever . Lucy was tall , handsome , and possessed of a good figure . She rarely smiled , and she did nothing in the way of make-up or hairdo to enhance her looks . She was the sort of personabout whom fashionable women were wont to say , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for her in two hours with the proper face and the proper clothes . " But no one ever did it or even suggested it . When it became known to the few hundred people in San Francisco who composed what they considered " the city " that Tom Layette was to remarry and that Lucy Sommers would be his bride , there were many and vociferous expressions of disbelief . In fact , there was no one in that entire circle who was more the total opposite of Eloise Clawson , his first wife , than Lucy Sommers . Tom , on the other hand , felt comfortable with Lucy , a feeling he had never experienced with Eloise . In some ways , she reminded him of his mother , although the only physical resemblance was in their common height . Eloise had been shy , retiring , and always uncertain with Tom . Lucy was calm and firm , and at this point she knew precisely what she desired in a marriage . " They say one does n't speak ill of the dead , " she once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I think it 's much more damaging to speak ill of the living . My husband is dead , but there is nothing good I care to say about him . He was an animal . I think you ought to know that , Tom . I do n't know whether I would ever have enjoyed sex if I had married someone else . Whatever the possibilities were , he spoiled them . After a108 THE ESTABLISHMENTyear of marriage , we separated , but I must say that the memory lingers on . You have asked me to many you . I want to be specific about the kind of arrangement you would be entering into . " " I have asked you to be my wife , not my bed partner . " " And you do n't consider that rather strange ? " " No stranger than a dozen marriages I know about , where that arrangementexists . The only difference is that we are putting our cards on the table . " " Do you have a mistress ? " she asked bluntly . " No . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would object to it becoming known . I will not be an object of laughter or contempt . I respect you and I think you respect me . We are both of us very wealthy and we are both ambitious . My father owns three acres on Pacific Heights , which he has promised to me . I think you know the property . It has a magnificent view . I want you to understand what I will ask of you . " " I already have a house on Pacific Heights , " Tom said rather lamely . " I know . It 's not the sort of house I contemplate , and it also happens to be another woman 's house . I am marrying you , Tom , because I like you . I am also marrying you because I feel that between us we can be successful . Success to you means wealth and political power ; I understand that . However , I am a woman , and I have my own dreams . I intend to be the most fashionable and successful hostess on the West @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well . I do n't know whether you realize how much you need a person like me . I know that our circle has a certain impression of me . I could not care less . When the time comes , an invitation to our home will be like an invitation to the White House . Politics is something more than the formalities of the governor 's mansion and the legislature . Politics is a question of power and the cultivation of people who have that power . " After that conversation , Tom changed his opinion of Lucy Sommers . He almost retreated from the marriage , caught between fear and admiration . He was torn between a sense of impending danger and the desire to give himself into the hands of a very strong woman . The need for security won out . After speaking to his mother , he told Lucy of her suggestion that they be married abroad . " What nonsense ! " Lucy exclaimed . " I do n't think so . My mother will not show up without my fa-ther . " INQUISITION @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peace with your father . We will have sufficient enemies without having them in the family . " " Oh , no . Lucy , I have not spoken to the man for twenty years . " " He 's in the hospital now . ' What better time is there ? If you do n't do it now , you never will . " Harvey Baxter 's assistant was a young man with the unlikely name of Boyd Kimmelman . He was very bright , had served with the judge advocate'soffice during the war , finished law school a year later , and displayedan aggressive sharpness of thought that disturbed Baxter as often as it pleased him . Now he was violently disagreeing with a position Baxter had taken . " As sure as hell , " he said to Barbara , " they 're going to ask you are you now or have you ever been a member of the Communist Party . " They were meeting in Baxter 's office , the two lawyers and Barbara , the morning of the day before she was due to leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sucked a pacifier and good-naturedly observedthe proceedings . " That does n't bother me , " Barbara said . " I am not and I never have been . All I have to do is answer truthfully . " " Exactly , " Baxter said . " Oh , no . No , sir , if you will permit me . It 's just not that simple . Those cookies hold all the cards . Suppose you were at some meeting , some civil liberties meeting , maybe a meeting in defense of the itinerantfarmworkers . From what Harvey says , you go for that kind of thing . Am I right ? " " You may be right , Mr. Kimmelman . " " Call me Boyd , Mrs. Cohen . As Harvey will tell you , I 'm too pushy to be entitled to respect . " " All right , Boyd . Yes , I 've been to meetings . I 've been to civil libertiesmeetings , and just two months ago I went to a meeting in defense of the Hollywood writers . I think that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ' Who knows ? The point I 'm making is this . Those creeps on the Un-American Committee , they have access to information , they have access to the FBI files , and you may be sure that every one of those protest meetings is covered by the FBI . You 're not exactly unknownin this town , Mrs. Cohen . So let 's say that you deny under oath that you ever have been a member of the Party . Then one of their paid informers stands up and swears he saw you at a communist meeting . " " He 'd be lying . " 110 THE ESTABLISHMENT " Can you swear it was not a communist-organized meeting ? " " For heaven 's sake , Boyd , " Baxter broke in , " that does n't make her a communist . " " Can she prove she 's not ? How ? Suppose an informer swears that she is . " " But I am not , " Barbara said . " How could anyone swear that I am ? What proof could they offer ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Those babies are not running a court of law . They 're not interested in proof or the rules of evidence . They 're running a Star Chamber . All they 're interested in is headlines , and they make headlines by nailing you . I know you 're not Jewish , Mrs. Cohen , but your name is , and they 're going to suck on that for starters . " " Come on , Boyd , " Baxter said with annoyance . " You see antiSemitismeverywhere . " " Only where it is . " " And Barbara ca n't refuse to answer a pertinent question . That 's contempt , and I will not subject her to a contempt . " " Contempt is only a misdemeanor , punishable by a year in prison  --  if they cite her . Perjury is a felony  --  a five-year offense . Would you subject her to that ? " " Now just hold on , " Barbara said . " This whole discussion is beginning to sound like a scene from Kafka , the two of you arguing about a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a criminal . I have done nothing illegal . I am a San Francisco housewife with a baby , and I have no intentions of going to jail . " " Nor shall you , " Baxter assured her . " I think Boyd here is raising ridiculousghosts . I can not conceive of anyone testifying that you are a member of the Communist Party . " " I can , " Kimmelman said . " Suppose I were a member of the Communist Party ? " Barbara asked . " Would that send me to prison ? I seem to have been laboring under the quaint and old-fashioned illusion that we live in a democracy . " " We still do , " Baxter affirmed . " Absolutely , and I will not let a handful of bigots in Washington convince me otherwise . If you were a member of the Communist Party , Barbara , and they asked you that question , you would simply admit it . That is , if you wished to . They can not punish you for a truthful answer to a question . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Boyd , " Baxter said , " we differ in our attitude toward the law . IINQUISITION 111regard it as a shield that man has erected through the ages as a defense of the best of civilization . You regard it as an antagonist , to be anticipatedand outwitted . No , hold on , " he said as Kimmelman began to protest . " Those are precisely the qualities that I treasure in you , but you are young and cynical . Whenever I encounter a situation of this sort , I ask myself what Sam Goldberg would have done . I have absolutelyno doubts on that score here . Sam would have advised Barbara to answer every question truthfully and forthrightly . I simply do not share your fears about informers and entrapment . For Barbara to refuse to answera question because she feared entrapment would be folly . " " So be it . " Kimmelman sighed . " We sit and talk about this ridiculous committee , " Barbara said , " and the only thing that really disturbs me is why I have not heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to call Tel Aviv , and I simply can not get through . I send cables and receive no answer . There must be some way to reach Bernie . " " It 's a very disturbed situation , " Baxter said . " You realize that , Barbara . Palestine is in a turmoil , practically a state of war . " " I know , and that worries me so . Harvey , there must be some way . You must know people who can make inquiries and get answers . " " Mrs. Cohen , " Kimmelman said , " my own feeling is that your husbandmay have sent you several cables . They are not getting through . The telephone lines are tied up with priorities . I know someone in the local Zionist organization who may be able to swing a priority , and I 'll be happy to see him this afternoon and see whether we can get a call through . Trouble is , it 's almost midnight in Tel Aviv , so we 'll have to wait a bit . I have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jewish army  --  and if I can reach him , I may have some news for you . " On the other hand , it may take a few days , and then there 's the possibilitythat your husband 's on his way home . I doubt that he could get a plane out of Palestine , so he may have had to take a ship to Italy or France . If he sent a cable , it may be lost or delayed . Why do n't you let me get into this while you and Harvey are in Washington ? " " I 'd be so grateful , " Barbara told him . " And you will let me know the moment you hear anything ? " " Of course . " The baby 's mood changed , and suddenly Samuel Thomas Cohen filled the office with the wailing sound of a healthy pair of lungs. 112 THE ESTABLISHMENT " I 'll get him home , " Barbara said . " That 's almost indecent in a law office . " " It 's a fine sound of life , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tomor- row morning at seven , Barbara , and we 'll drive to the airport . I do n't think we 'll be in Washington more than a day . " At home , Barbara fed Sam and then put him in the car and drove to the Higate Winery in the Napa Valley . It was early afternoon when she arrived , turning off Highway 29 and climbing the dirt road that led to the cluster of old , ivy-covered , stone buildings . A visit to Higate always gave Barbara a feeling of warmth and security . For one thing , it was old , as such things are measured in California . The original stone build- ings had been put up by Italian masons in the eighteen seventies and had been added to and refurbished by the Levys . And the warmth of the Levy family made her feel that she was always welcome . After Barbara had arranged with Eloise to take care of Sam for the next few days , Clair Levy persuaded her to remain at Higate for an early dinner . Sarah Levy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sausalito and was now living with her son and daughter-in-law at Hiate . She was at the table with Jake and Clair , Adam and Eloise , Sall g y ' who had come up from Los Angeles with her daughter , and Barbara . Sally 's ostensible reason was to allow Sarah to feast her eyes on the in- fant May Ling ; but in all truth , Sally could not bear for Barbara , whom she worshipped , to go to Washington without seeing her . They sat around the big deal table in Clair 's high ceilinged , beamed , and tiled kitchen , the table heaped with food  --  platters of fried chicken , bowls of potatoes , asparagus , broccoli , stewed apples , tomatoes , and three kinds of pickles  --  as if this vast amount of food was a testimony to the existence of normality and sanity . Barbara did not know whether to laugh or weep . She had no idea what Jake Levy had been long ago , but now he was totally a farmer , a big , sunburned man with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outside , people in Washington , people who tilled no earth and grew no crop , but sucked the substance of America . The thought of Barbara being handed a subpoena , of Bar- bara hauled to Washington , of Barbara before an inquisition , enraged him . Clair was calmer but equally indignant . Strangely , Barbara found herself on the defensive . " Nothing is going to happen to me . In fact , I look forward to the experience . I tell myself that it is part of being a writer , part of the price one pays for the trade . And it 's a very positive thing that I am being shaken up a bit . When I take Sammy to Huntington Park and sit there in the sunshine with the INQUISITION 113young mothers , I begin to forget that any other world exists . So this is good for me , and if I could only get some word from that crazy husbandof mine , I would relax and allow myself to be delighted with the experience . " " It would n't delight me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outrage ! " " But I know exactly what Bobby means , " Sally told them . " If Oscar Wilde had not gone to prison , how could he have written The Ballad of Reading Gaol , and if Bunyan had not gone to prison , then no Pilgrim'sProgress , and Cervantes and Don Quixote  --  and do you know , Thoreau was put in prison because he refused to pay taxes to support the Mexican war , and when Emerson saw him there , he said , Henry , what are you doing in there ? ' and Thoreau said , Waldo , what are you doing out there ? ' So I know exactly what Bobby means , but I still think it 's a stinking shame . " " I am not going to prison , and I do think there are more pleasant matters to discuss , and this wine is so good ! What do you call it ? " " Pop calls it a Chablis , " Adam replied , " which it is not . There is reallyno such thing as a Chablis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snorted . " It 's as fine a Chablis as ever came out of France . " " Which is just the point . Chablis is the generic name for the white Burgundies that come out of the Chablis region in France . This is better than any Chablis I ever tasted . It 's more delicate , and it has a better bouquet . Just hold it in your mouth a moment before you swallow ; Bobby . No tartness , or almost none . It 's a California wine , pure California . In fact , outside of the Napa and Sonoma valleys , no one grows a grape that can do this . We can make the best damn wine in the world , but we have such an inferiority complex about it that we give them French names and pretend we 're making French wines . We 're not . " " It 's hard enough to sell it as it is , " Jake said . " Without calling ii Chablis , we would n't sell a hundred gallons . " " What would you call it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't know . Any local name . I 'd call this Eloise . " " Oh , thank you , " Eloise said . " I prefer not to become a wine , if yot do n't mind . One glass of it gives me a splitting migraine . If you namec it after me , heaven knows what would happen . " " You mean you never drink wine ? " Barbara asked . " Never . I do n't dare . And I do love it . Is n't that an awful irony , to be married to a winemaker and not be able to drink it ? " 114 THE ESTABLISHMENTSally grabbed her hand as they left the table . " Bobby , I must talk to you . Are you going home now ? " " I 'm afraid I must . I 'm leaving for Washington in the morning . " " Just a few minutes , please ? " They went up to Sally 's old room , and Sally sat with May Ling in her arms . " Is n't she absolutely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a oneyear-old , she 's brilliant  --  I mean for twelve months , you ca n't expect too much , can you ? I think she looks very Chinese , but Joe insists that Chinesechildren do not have sandy hair . But with seven or eight hundred million people , such a generalization is ridiculous  --  " " Sally , " Barbara interrupted , " that 's not what you want to talk to me about . " " No . My marriage . My marriage stinks . And I want to weep , because how can I be married to your brother and have it turn into such a rottenmess ? " " It has nothing to do with being married to my brother . You 're married to Joe . Now what has happened ? " " I 've disappeared . I do n't exist . We 've been married two lousy years , and I do n't exist . " " Oh , Sally , come on . What do you mean , you do n't exist ? " " I 'll tell you exactly what I mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clinic at seven . At ten he goes to the hospital to operate . Then back to the clinic . Then back to the hospital . Then back to the clinic . If I 'm lucky , he 's home at eight . Otherwise , nine , ten  --  just early enough to stuff some food into himself and fall into bed . Oh , I do n't mean he 's cruel to me or nasty or mean . You know Joe . He could n't even be mean to Adolf Hitler . He 'd just examine him and prescribe pills for his cra-ziness . " " Have you tried to talk to him ? " " Of course I have . He does n't hear me . I have my poetry and I have May Ling . He considers that a full life . The only thing he leaves out of his thinking is marriage . I do love him , Bobby , and this thing is driving me right up the creek . " " Sally , darling , " Barbara said , " I do n't have any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't think your marriage is breaking up . It wo n't unless you want it to . Let me get through this stupid committee business , and I 'll be able to sit down and talk with both of you . Perhaps that will help . " " Will you ? Will you , Bobby ? " " I promise . " INQUISITION 115Sam was asleep in his crib . Barbara kissed him lightly , thanked Eloise and Adam profusely , and then drove back to San Francisco alone . The cable was pushed under her front door . She tore it open , and saw from the date that it had been delayed five days . It read , " No way to get through on the phone . Flight successful , goods bought , and all planes safe in Tel Aviv . Flight out of here impossible . Booked passage from Haifa to Naples . Then to London , and hopefully flight home . Ten days at most . I love you . Promise never to leave you again . " It was signed " Bernie . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room when Tom appeared . Her surprise was more than she could cope with ; she simply stared and said nothing . " Well , I 'm not a ghost , mother . I 'm real , " Tom informed her . " Yes , I know you 're real , " Jean said slowly . " How is he ? " " Much better . " " Can I see him ? " " I do n't want him upset , " Jean said . " I do n't want him hurt . He 's been hurt enough . What made you come here ? " " That 's a hell of a note , " Tom complained . " Instead of admitting that I might be doing a decent thing , you 're being hostile . " " I 'm not hostile . I 'm just worried . You have n't spoken to your father for twenty years . " " And he has n't spoken to me . " " All right , Tommy . This is no time to rehash anything . If you go in there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you concerned for him ? " " I think so , " Tom replied uncertainly . The truth was , he did n't know . " Then if you go inside , you must forget the past . I do n't want you to talk about anything but your concern for him . " " I 'll try . " " That 's not good enough . I want you to promise me . " Tom nodded . " I 'll go in first and tell him . He does n't need a shock . " She turned to the door . " Wait here . Do n't lose your nerve and run . " " I 'll be here , " he answered , thinking that she still treated him like a small , willful boy . Dan , propped up in bed , was reading an old , battered copy of Masefield 's Salt Water Ballads . May Ling had bought it for him thirty116 THE ESTABLISHMENTyears before , and it had her inscription inside the cover : " For a loving and gentle saltwater man . " Jean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him , not mentioning the inscription . That puzzled him , but there were any number of things about Jean that puzzled him . Now he put down the book and said , " I wish you liked small boats . " " That depends on how small they are . I could learn . " " I 've been thinking of something about thirty feet , sloop-rigged , something that the two of us could handle . I 'd build it myself  --  well , not with my own hands , but I 'd design it and watch it every step of the way . Build it of teak  --  none of this rotten plastic they 're using now . I 'm not thinking of anything ambitious . There 's enough water and shorelinein the bay to keep a man occupied for years . I 'd teach you to sail . You know , that was something I planned to do from the first day we were married , and believe me , you 'd learn at the hand of a master . " " It 's a thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Get well first . I 'm not saying no . Meanwhile , there 's a visitor outside . I thought I 'd tell you before he comes in . " " Tom . " " Tom ? " " Our Tom . Your son . " Softly , Dan said , " No . Well , I 'll be damned . He wants to see me . " " That 's right . Do you want to see him ? " " I want to see him . Yes . " " All right , Danny . But the past is over . Otherwise , there 's no use seeinghim at all . " " I 'll buy that . " " I 'll send him in and stay outside , " Jean said . " I think it 's best if you see him alone . " Dan waited apprehensively . His heart was beating more rapidly , and he wondered whether that was good or bad after what had happened to him . It would not be literally true to say that he had not seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a large city , and three times duringthe years he had caught sight of Tom , most recently in the distance , and before that twice in the same room at public functions . His feelings about Tom were a complex maze of contradictions . On one level , Tom was an unmitigated bastard ; on another level , Dan blamed himself and softened the characterization ; on still another level , he tried to grapple with the fact that his son was very possibly a homosexual , butINQUISITION 117since his notions of what constituted homosexuality were rather primitive , he dealt with the possibility by negating it and putting it down to an incorrect conclusion of others or as a temporary aberration from the normal . With all his faults , Dan Layette was not intolerant ; he was not given to hatred or grudges . After all , two generations ago , when the Chinese were an anathema to almost all of the white population of San Francisco , he had hired May Ling 's father as his bookkeeper and had subsequently made him the manager of all his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hesitated to condemn others . And as far as Tom was concerned , he had lived with an aching desire , a dream that one day the boy would lay aside his hurt and bitterness and return to him , for Dan had never denied Tom 's right to despise him . By the measure of his own coin , he had failed his children , and if Barbara and Joe chose to forgive him that failure and to love him in spite of it , the virtue was theirs , not his . When he had given the hundred and ten thousand dollars to Bernie Cohen , his excuse that he was paying a debt to Mark Levy was an empty apology and no more ; the truth was that a child of his , through her husband , had come with a plea . At that point he was allowed to give , and that was all that mattered to him . His was the peculiar anguish of a once poverty-stricken child whose family now was of the establishment . He still measured giving by the thing that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the past , she was controlling her own ghosts . There was no thought of the past in Dan 's mind as Tom entered the room . He was unaware of his slight smile , thinking only that his son was a fine-looking man , tall , well built  --  his father 's frame and his mother 's color and good looks . He was thirty-six years old , one of a half dozen of the wealthiest and most powerful men in California . Dan made no obeisance to wealth and power , but they were the measure of the game he had played for most of his life . " Hello , dad , " Tom said tentatively . He , too , was apprehensive . Dan held out his hand , and Tom took it . His grip was firm . " How do you feel ? " " Not bad , " Dan replied . " You know , this is a Jewish hospital . They have a funny expression about a coronary . They say , now you 're barmitzvahed . " The words came out , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What a stupid thing to say , he thought . What a stupid way to begin ! Why could n't I keep my mouth shut ? " I guess you do n't know what that means , " he said lamely. 118 THE ESTABLISHMENT " Sure I do . Only it does n't apply . You were a man when you were still a kid . It 's people like me who have to do the growing up . " Dan stared at him , wondering whether he meant it . He remembered a boy 's voice . This voice was strong , well modulated , the voice of a man who was listened to . " I 'm glad you came , " Dan said . " It 's been too long . " " I know it has . " " Pull over a chair . Sit down . " " I should have brought flowers , " Tom said . " Who the hell wants flowers ! I 'm not dead . The flowers keep coming and I send them down to the ward . You know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I wish I had thought of that . But mother would have killed me . " " I suppose so . She prowls around here like a cop . You look good . Taking care of yourself ? " I try . " " How 's business ? " Dan asked , unable to think of anything else to say , or unable to say any of the hundred things he thought of , unable to ask whether he had been missed , loved , cherished , hated , unable to ask whether his son was happy , lonely , fulfilled , resentful . " Well , the chaps in Washington say we 're going to own the world , that it 's our century . I used to think that business was a matter of makingmoney . But then money becomes meaningless , and the whole game becomes something else . " " I know the feeling , " Dan agreed . " I suppose we own a very substantial part of the world already . The question is , where do I go from here ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his tongue . " I 'm going to run for Congress , " Tom said . Dan nodded . " I heard . " " What do you think of the idea ? " Dan nodded again . " I think you 'll make it . Does that mean you 'll leave Whittier in control ? " " Not on your life , " Tom said . " I know you do n't like John . I guess you have your reasons . He 's no one to like or dislike . He 's an old fool and a hypochondriac . I 've been pressing him to retire , and I imagine he will . You know , I 'm getting married . " " Yes , Jean told me . " " Lucy Sommers . " " I knew her father , but I never met her . I 'm sure she 's a fine girl . " INQUISITION 119 " She 's a fine woman , dad . A year or two older than I. But that makes no difference . " " Of course not . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he did not want to tire Dan . He shook hands with his father and kissed Jean , then left . " How did it go ? " Jean asked Dan . Dan shrugged . " All right . " " He was pleasant ? " " Oh , yes . " " What did you talk about ? " " Nothing . " " You were pleasant , were n't you , Danny ? " " I was so damn glad to see him  --  " " Then what happened ? " " Nothing . Absolutely nothing . " Then Dan added , almost woefully , " He was a total stranger , Jeanie . I suppose I anticipated everything else , everything except that . But how could I expect anything else ? " The next day , when Barbara was already on her way to Washington , the story about her subpoena broke in the San Francisco press . Theheadline in the Chronicle Iead : SAN FRANCISCO WRITER SUBPOENAED BY HOUSE COMMITTEE . The Examiner 's , headline said : BARBARA LAYETTE COHEN TO BE UNFRIENDLY WITNESS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the news sooner or later , told him about it before she showed him the newspapers , assuring him that neither Barbara nor Harvey Baxter was greatly concerned . " No doubt it 's her experience in Germany that they wish to make the most of , but that 's no secret . Barbarawrote about it , and thousands of people know about it . It 's their wretched way of making headlines , and you are not to become angry , please , Dan . " " Those filthy sons of bitches , " Dan said . " What in hell is happening , Jean ? What 's happening to this country ? And why did n't Barbara tell me ? When did all this begin ? " " About ten days ago . And it 's perfectly obvious why she did n't tell you . " " Did you know ? " " Yes , Barbara told me . " " And you did n't tell me ? " " Danny , you can understand that . " 120 THE ESTABLISHMENT " She ought to have the best damn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harvey Baxter with her . " " Harvey Baxter is a damned old woman . You should have told me . I know people in Washington . I probably could have had this squashed . " " You were in no condition to do anything , Dan . I spoke to Harvey , and he 's not worried . " " Where 's the baby ? " " At Higate with Eloise and Adam . Do n't worry , please . " It was easier to tell him that than to keep her own fears down . John ' Whittier entered Tom 's office and put the Chronicle on his desk . Whittier , a stout , red-faced man , looked sick . " I 've seen it , " Tom said . " Are you all right ? " " I do n't know . It 's either my stomach or a heart attack . This is terrible . This is absolutely terrible , Thomas . " " Yes . " " With the primaries three months away . " " I can count , John . " " Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That damned sister of yours has been nothing but grief and aggravation since the day I met your mother . " " I know . We do n't pick our relatives . " " Did you know about this ? " " No , not until today , " Tom replied . " I am as upset and angry and frustrated as you are . " " Why on God 's earth did n't she tell you ? We might have done something about it . " " You 'd have to ask her that . " " Has the press been in touch with you yet ? " " Not yet . But they will . " " How the devil can you sit there like that ? Have you called her ? Spoken to her ? " " I imagine she 's on her way to Washington . I called her home . There 's no answer . " " Well , what are they after ? Is she a commie ? I 've always suspected she was . " " John , do n't be an ass . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? I 've heard all sorts of wild stories about him . " " John , I do n't know any more about this than you do . I 've been onINQUISITION 121the phone with the county chairman and the state chairman , and there was nothing I could tell either of them . I told Janet to hold all my calls so that I could think about this . Now I suggest you go back to your office and do the same . " After Whittier left , Janet Loper , Tom 's secretary , buzzed him and said that Mrs. Carter was on the phone . Carter was Lucy Sommers ' married name ; after her husband 's death , she had resumed her maiden name . Tom had to think for a moment before he made the connection . " I 'll talk to her , " he said . He tried to pull his thoughts together . " Since when are you Mrs. Carter ? " he asked her . " Did I say that ? Well , that shows you where my mind is . Tom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Not yet , no . " " Do n't . Get out of the office . I 'll meet you at Casper 's for lunch in half an hour . It 's a quiet place , and probably no one we know will be there . We must talk before this goes any further . " " I ca n't leave now . Everyone and his mother is trying to reach me . " " Precisely why you should leave . Please trust me . " At Casper 's , a tiny French restaurant tucked away on Leavenworth Street , Lucy was waiting for him , well hidden in a booth at the rear . Tom dropped down on the bench facing her and stared wordlessly . " Poor dear , " she said . " I ordered a Scotch for you . I had to get you out of there . I can imagine . " She appeared so competent , so cool and self-contained , that Tom found himself relaxing . " You know , " she went on , " I 'm rather glad we can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the end of the world by any means , but we must sort out things before this goes any further . First things first . Is Barbara a communist ? " " John asked me that . I told him not to be an ass . " " But now you 're not so certain ? " " How does one know ? I talk to Barbara three or four times a year . We 're not exactly loving siblings . She has done some damn strange things . " " The Examiner calls her an unfriendly witness . ' What exactly does that mean ? " " I called my lawyer and asked him . Apparently they subpoenaed her , after which she made no gesture of cooperation . " " Perhaps she has a clear conscience . " " Lucy , Barbara has done some crazy things in her time , like giving away the fortune she inherited to set up the Layette Foundation , but I 've never had an inkling of her being a red . " " And suppose the worst came out ? How would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still give you the designation ? " " They 're shaky . " " All right , Thomas . Until we hear what happens in Washington , we make no statements and speak to no one . I have a lovely little cottage at Nicasio up in Marin . Suppose we go there and hide out for two or three days . It will give us a chance to think and plan  --  and to know each other a little better . " Tom stared at her . Her use of " we " unsettled him ; on the other hand , no one had ever taken responsibility for him or his fate before ; looking at this strong-featured , handsome woman who sat facing him , he experienced a sense of relief . For the first time that day , someone had proposed an affirmative action . " I have my car outside . Shall I order lunch ? " Tom nodded . " One of my larger regrets , " Harvey Baxter said to Barbara , " is that I never joined the Masonic order . Not that Sam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mason for forty years . " They were in the plane , flying east to Washington , when Baxter voiced his regret , apropos of nothing that Barbara could think of ; she asked him why on earth he should think of that just then . " It might help . I 'm trying to think of anything that might help . There might just be a Mason on that committee , although it 's not too likely . Anyway , I should have joined . My wife talked me out of it . Said I had enough things in my life that kept us apart . Never met my wife , did you , Barbara ? " " I 'm sure she 's lovely , Harvey . " " But possessive , Barbara . Possessive . Women are possessive . With the exception of a few like you . If I had ever proposed going off as your husband did , my wife would have had a case of hysterics . Not that I see myself embarking upon anything as ill-advised . As your attorney , " he apologized , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You do under- stand ? " " Of course , Harvey . " " Even a trip like this worries her . I suspect it 's the thought of the two of us traveling alone . " " Well , Harvey , you are an attractive man . " " Do you think so ? I assured her  --  " " Of course you did . Now let 's talk about what to expect . Will this be anything like the Hollywood writer hearings , with the publicity and the cameras and all the rest of it ? " " I do n't think so . I spoke to Donald Jay . He 's the counsel for the committee , and he 'll do a good deal of the questioning . He indicated that the session will be held in chambers . " " What does that mean ? " " It means no press and no publicity during the hearing . They 'll meet in the committee room in the House Office Building , just you and the committee . You see , they 're not too sure of themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd like to have a go at a whole slew of writers , and they chose you because they feel you 're vulnerable . " " But why ? Why me ? " " The Nazi business , probably . But I am stating their position . I do not think you 're vulnerable . Possibly they have something entirely different in mind . It does n't matter . I feel quite secure about you . " " Well , I 'm glad you do . I do n't . Tell me , Harvey , is n't this precisely what Boyd calls a Star Chamber hearing ? If I remember correctly , historically , the Star Chamber was a place in England where the accused was tried without benefit of defense counsel or jury . Is n't this the same thing ? " " Oh , no , no . Not at all , Barbara . Congress functions through committees . Theoretically , this committee was formed to frame legislation to defend the United States against internal subversion . As such , they have the right to subpoena witnesses and take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not that they have ever offered any legislation . I have nothing but contempt for their methods . But their function is within the law . They are not a court , simply a committee of inquiry , and so long as you answer any pertinent questions forthrightly and honestly , there is absolutely nothing they can do to you . I do not share Boyd 's qualms . " " Will you be in the room with me ? " " They have the right to exclude me , but I do n't think they will . jay was very polite when we spoke on the telephone , very cooperative . " " And just what is pertinent ? " " That 's hard to anticipate . They operate under a very broad spectrum . We 'll decide that on specifics . I know this is unpleasant and time-consuming , Barbara , but it 's a fact of life in these times . " " I suppose it is . " Because of the three-hour time difference , it was almost dark when the plane landed in Washington . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Baxter had booked rooms for them . Barbara pleaded tiredness and begged off dinner with Baxter , saying she would have a sandwich and coffee in her room . She felt that another hour of Harvey Baxter 's observations on history and politics was more than she could tolerate . In her room , she unpacked her things , then drew a very hot bath and soaked in it for almost an hour . She lay there , up to her neck in the deliciously warm water , now with her eyes closed , drifting off into fantasy , then with her eyes open , observing and measuring herself . The scar of her Caesarean , once so raw and ugly , had faded to a modest pink . Her body was still good , her breasts firm , her waistline only an inch more than it had been ten years before . Needing reassurance , she accepted the pleasure that came from observing herself . She was still a well-formed and attractive woman . She visualized a second scar on her body . She could still have another child , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ section was no more dangerous than a normalbirth . Very easy for him to say . He did not have to be sliced open . Still , she was rapidly approaching an age where the decision would have to be made , but not tonight . It would wait for when she could discuss it with Bernie  --  and from Bernie , her thoughts drifted to Marcel . More and more , as time passed , Barbara found it difficult to accept the fact of Marcel 's death . It was so easy to drift into the fantasy that it was simplya separation and that one day she would see him again . Was it becauseFrance was a world away and Paris almost like a dream that had never happened ? In her dreams , Paris was always soaked in sunlight , a dream city of wonderful romance . How would it be now , she wondered , after the war ? Would she ever go back there ? Did she want to ? Marcel was buried in Toulouse . Strange that she had no desire to go back to Toulouse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the type who put flowers on graves and who wept on tombstones . The past lived in her mind . It was there whenever she wanted it . After her bath , she called room service and ordered a sandwich , salad , and coffee , then read a copy of the Washington Post that she had bought at the airport . Her appearance before the House Committee was front-page news , and the story described her as the " attractive San Francisco heiress-turned-novelist . " The story was noncommittal . Even the liberal newspapers were cautious about taking sides , and Barbara had the feeling that no one was totally exempt from the pall of fear that had cast its shadow over the country . Was it indeed like GermanyINQUISITION 125in the time of Hitler ? She cast back to her own memories of Berlin in 1939 . No , she would not accept that . She could not . It was not yet ten o'clock , and she was not ready for bed , for what would probably be a sleepless night . She sat down at the writing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nowhere to send the letter , but it was pleasant to imagine that he might well be back in San Francisco when she returned , in which case she would simply hand the letter to him . There it is ; you can read what I felt the night before I faced the tiger in his den . " My dear oversized husband , " she began ; then she tore the sheet up impatiently . Why did she always dwell on his size ? Was it because she saw him as a small , frightened boy who had spent his life attempting to overcome his fears ? " Bernie , dear one , " was better , and she went on : " Here I am in a hotel in Washington , D.C. , trying to understand why I deceived you . At first I thought it was very noble of me not to tell you about the subpoena , which arrived before you left on that nutty mission of yours , because if I had told you , then you might have decided not to leave me to face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon due reflection , I have come to the conclusion that I withheld the fact because I was afraid that you would never forgive me for aborting your adventure . Believe me , I know you and love you well enough to know how much you wanted to take that flight of planes over to Europe and save the brave Jews whom you felt you had deserted by marrying me and settling down to run a garage in San Francisco . But do n't think I did n't have some very bad moments when days went by without a word from you . Happily , I received your cable yesterday , so I could come here with no more to worry about than two days of Harvey Baxter 's legal advice . ' Why , why do lawyers talk the way they do ? Ah well , you will not solve that one . " As to why I have been subpoenaed , we have not the faintest notion , except to guess that it concerns my own harebrained adventure when I undertook my mission to Berlin . But since I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read , I am not concerned about repeating the story to these local anthropoids . Anyway , here I am in Washington , and today we made the front page in both the San Francisco Chronicle and the Washington Post . I really am notorious . And it just occurs to me , as I write this , that poor Tom will have no end of explaining to do to his Republican sponsors . What will they think of a conservative candidate whose sister is redder than a rose ? I think I shall clear Tom by making a public statement to the effect that we disagree about everything . After126 THE ESTABLISHMENTall , Booth 's career was not ruined simply because his brother shot Lincoln . Or was it ? I shall have to check that . " Anyway , just as you must assuage your soul by such dumb escapades as the present one , so must I as a writer poke my nose into this and that . It did occur to me that daddy , with all his kudos from the War Shipping Board , might do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man had a mild heart attack , and right now he 's in the hospital , and this is hardly something to annoy him with in his presentcondition . He is going to be all right , but still , I did not want him to know about it until he was much stronger . And I must confess that I am filled with curiosity as to how our local brand of repression functions , and also , believe it or not , it 's my first trip to Washington . I am to appear before the committee at ten A.M. tomorrow , and if they do n't keep me too long , I intend to spend the rest of the day sightseeing , since I do n't have to be at the airport until five . " Also , you must not worry about Sam . Our beautiful son is up at Higate , where Eloise is taking very good care of him . We do have good and dear friends . Harvey Baxter is a very nice gentleman , but I think he is a dunderhead ; if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answer is that one does n't . He was Sam Goldberg 's partner , and he must know something . Anyway , I have my own common sense to fall back on , so I am not really worried , just quite curious to see what faces me . " Now to bed , and please , please be home when I arrive tomorrow , so we can resume our sensible , plodding lives . It should please you that I am ready to be so content in a world that is so packed with discontent . I love being a housewife and I love being a mother , and if you have gottenall the maggots out of your system , I am ready to discuss having a second child . I know I ca n't produce the half dozen you originally desired , but two are a nice round number . Get home ! " She underlined the last two words . Stephan Cassala opened the door of Dan 's room tentatively . He had been a daily visitor since the heart attack , and today he came with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short , slender boy , much like his father , was twenty-one and a senior at Stanford . He was Stephan 's only child , a fact of considerable sorrow to Stephan 's mother , whose daughter , Rosa , had presented her with five grandchildren . " Come on in , " Dan called out ; Stephan was relieved at the strength and vigor in his voice . Dan 's bed was tilted up , and half a dozen newspaperswere spread out over the counterpane . INQUISITION 127 " I had dinner in town with Ralph , " Stephan explained . " I thought I 'd bring him along . He wanted to see you . " " Glad you did . " Dan shook hands with the boy . It was , two years since he had seen him . " You look fine . " " How do you feel , sir ? " " Good . What are you up to , Ralph ? " " Well , sir , you know I 'm at my last year in school . They 've been allowingme to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I think I 've found a way to improve it . " " Physics ? " " Well , it 's all I ever really wanted . " The boy shook hands with Dan again and left . When he had gone , Stephan shook his head . " I try , Dan , but he 's beyond anything I understand . Would you believe it , there 's a good chance he 's on his way to a Nobel Prize . Twenty-one years old , two generations out of a Sicilian hole of ignorance and superstition . We did n't do too badly . " " We sure as hell did n't . How 's Joanna ? " Stephan shrugged . " How long can an empty marriage survive ? She lives , I live . There 's no point in talking about that . How do you feel ? " " Pretty good . Another week , and Jean takes me home  --  but how I 'm going to stand another week of this , I do n't know . Tom came to see me . " Surprised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too bad . It 's time . " " Yes , it 's time , " Stephan said . " I 've been reading about my daughter , " Dan said , pointing to the newspapers . " I know . I saw Senator Clayboume . He happened to be in town yesterday , and I pulled all our rank to get to him . He gave me ten min-utes . " " We gave that sonofabitch ten thousand dollars . " " Well , it 's a thousand dollars a minute . It did n't buy much . The truth is , Dan , he 's scared . So help me God , McCarthy and this committeehas the whole damn country running scared . He says there 's not one blessed thing that he or anyone else in the Senate can do about the House committee . He wo n't touch it . This business of guilt by associationhas become a disease with us . " " Did you get anything from him ? " " Nothing . He suggested that you might call the President . You do know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I met him once . So did ten thousand others . " " I spoke to judge Fredericks . His feeling is that you should relax and simply let events take their course . They will question Barbara and she 'll answer their questions , and they 'll make their headlines and that will be the end of it . Whatever damage it may do to her career  --  well , that has already taken place , and she 'll survive it . I had the crazy notion of a lawsuit against the committee  --  " " That 's not so crazy . " " Well , it 's out of the question , Dan . You ca n't sue a congressional committee . " " I 'd like to corner the lot of them in a dark alley . That 's all in the head . I indulge the luxury of talking tough , and there is n't a damn thing I can do for the kid . What 's all that ? " he asked , pointing to Stephan 's briefcase . " I thought we might go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No . No , forget it , Steve . Business is the last thing in the world I give a damn about right now . I 've been lying here trying to make some sense out of being alive sixty years on this earth , and in my present state of confusion , you 'll get nothing sensible out of me . By the way , have you been able to reach Bernie ? " " No . Nothing at the house , and at the garage , they 've heard nothing . " It was almost three o'clock in the morning before Barbara finally fell asleep , and she was awake at seven , wide awake with no feeling of weariness , cheered by the thought that after seeing this long day through , she would be back home in San Francisco before midnight , California time . Jean had been very insistent about Barbara 's clothes , having alwaysregarded her daughter as a prime enemy of fashion ; so in deference to her mother 's wishes , Barbara had agreed to appear in a navy blue suit , black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair was just wavy enough to present no difficulties . She wore it parted on the side and cut evenly just above her shoulders , and it took her only a few minutes to comb it out . Her complexion was good , and after a brief glance in the mirror , she decided that the occasion did not warrant make-up . Before breakfast , she walked in the lovely gardens of the hotel . She was alone except for a black man who was trimming rose bushes and who bid her good morning . " It 's a beautiful morning , " Barbara agreed . " Do you have many days like this ? " INQUISITION 129 " Some . Not so much at this time of the year as in another month . You ai n't from here ? " " California . San Francisco . " ' Mat 's a long way . " " It is . It is indeed . " She walked back to the hotel dining room , hungry now . Harvey Baxter was already there , hunched over bacon and eggs . He jumped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up , Harvey . I feel wonderful . We shall tilt against Mr. Drake 's committee and conquer them . Onward and upward ! " " Barbara , I do wish you 'd be serious . It 's not Mr. Drake 's committee . He 's simply well known locally because he 's from our state . Not that I wish to defend him . I find most of his practices deplorable . But you must take this seriously . I just had a call from Congressman Hood 's office . He 's the ranking member . The hearing will be public . It will not be filmed or televised , but they will have a press table . " " What made them change their plans ? " " I do n't know , and that worries me . They must have dug up something . Barbara , are you sure that we 've discussed everything ? " " I think so . Harvey , please do n't worry . " " One slight ray of sunshine . With this kind of hearing , I shall be sittingnext to you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Good . Now let the condemned woman eat a proper breakfast . " They took a cab to the House Office Building , and Barbara , looking about her , observed , " It is a rather nice city , except that one has seen so many pictures of everything . " " I keep thinking that Sam Goldberg would have been more thorough , " Baxter said worriedly . " I suppose it 's why I 'm here that keeps me from being thrilled . You 've been here before , so you 're not thrilled . That 's the Capitol , Harvey . " The truth was that Barbara was simply impatient with the whole thing . Her mood of a few hours before was washing out , and now she was irritated that a handful of men in Washington had the undisputed power to summon her across the country and ask her questions  --  with the threat of punishment hanging over her head if she refused to answer . The guard at the desk in the House Office Building took their names and told them what room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , down a corridor to where a cluster of men stood smoking and waiting . They examined her with their eyes as she and Baxter entered the room , 130 THE ESTABLISHMENTbut no one spoke to her , and she wondered whether they were reporters . There were five men already in the room . Three of them sat at the press table . One sat in front of a raised platform that held a long table and fiddled with a stenotype machine . The fifth man , tall , cadaverous , and gray-complexioned , came to them as they entered . He had small , dark eyes under bristling brows , sunken cheeks , and a long hatchet chin ; he introduced himself as Donald jay , counsel to the committee . Barbara noticed that his fingernails were clogged with dirt . He shook hands with Baxter . She told herself that if he offered a hand to her , it would go untouched . " You can both sit here , Mr. Baxter , " he said , indicating a small table in front of the press table and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chairs at the press table , but Barbara noticed a dozen additional chairs behind it , either for additional press or for some small section of the public . The room itself was no more than forty-five feet long and twenty-five feet wide . On the long table on the raised platform , five small placards spelled out the names of the congressmen who would make up the quorum : Arthur Hood , Norman Drake , Lomas Pornay , John Mankin , and Alvin Bindle . Of the five , Barbara was familiaronly with Drake , who represented a district in the Bay Area . A few minutes after Barbara and Baxter were seated , people began to drift into the room  --  a United States marshal , a fat man in a dark suit , his badge pinned to his jacket ; additional members of the press , until all the seats at the press table were filled and four more seats behind it ; and finally the congressmen : Hood , short , tight-lipped , pale blue eyes behind gold-rimmed glasses ; Drake , expressionless , his puffy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , fat , rolls around his neck , a bright pink complexion , a sort of Tammany Hall caricature ; Mankin , the oldest of the lot , his face drooping in folds of flesh like a hostile basset hound ; and last , Bindle , good-looking , youngish , smiling nervously . They took their respective seats , picked up the pencils at each place , surveyed the group , and waited , for the most part expressionless . Then , after what he apparently considered a suitable amount of time , Mankin , speaking in a heavy southern drawl , said , " Meeting of the House of Representatives Committee on Un-American Activities , sixteenthday of March , nineteen forty-eight . Let the record show that a quorum is present . " " So noted , " Donald Jay said . " Is the first witness present ? " INQUISITION 131 " Yes , sir . " " Let the witness be sworn , " Mankin said . The marshal walked over to Barbara and held out a Bible . " Put your hand on it , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give here will be the truth , the whole truth , and nothing but the truth ? " The words ran together , blurred and meaningless . " I do , " Barbara said . " Let the record show that the witness has been sworn , " Jay said . He had moved to one side of the room so that he would not block the view of any of the congressmen , and he stood there with his arms folded . " Will the witness state her name ? " he asked Barbara . " Barbara Cohen . " " Is that Miss or Mrs. ? " " Mrs. " " Is that your only name ? " Dixon snapped suddenly . " I do n't understand you . " " Are you known by any other name ? " Jay asked her . " Barbara Layette , " she replied uncertainly . " Is that a pseudonym ? " " No , it 's my maiden name . I use it for my writing . " " Why ? " " Because I began to publish before I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew me as Barbara Layette . I saw no reason to change my literary name . " Then she whispered to Baxter , " This is idiotic . Must I answer any stupid question they ask me ? " Baxter nodded . " Please  --  you must , Barbara . " " Will you state your profession , " Jay said . " My profession ? But I just told you . " " Please answer the question . " Barbara sighed . " Very well . I am a writer . I am also a housewife . I am also a mother . I practice all three professions , and I suspect that all of them are professions more constructive in the life of this nation than that of being a congressman  --  " " The witness , " Hood interrupted , " will confine herself to answering the questions asked of her ! " " For heaven 's sake , " Baxter whispered , " do n't antagonize them . " " I see the witness has a sense of humor , " Jay acknowledged . " This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to consider my next question thoughtfully . Are you now or have you ever been a member of the Communist Party ? " 132 THE ESTABLISHMENT Barbara did not pause to consider it . " I am not and I never have been a member of the Communist Party . " " I see , " Jay said . He turned to Drake , who took a sheaf of papers out of his breast pocket and spread them on the table in front of him . He studied the papers for a long moment , pursing his lips . " Mrs. Cohen , " Drake said , " where were you residing in the month of May nineteen thirty-nine ? " Here it comes , Barbara thought , almost relieved . " I was living in Paris . " " I see . And what was the nature of your residence there ? I mean , were you a tourist , a student ? " " I was a journalist . I was the Paris correspondent for Manhattan Magazine . " " And what were your duties in that position ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ styles , on new books , on plays that opened , art exhibits  --  that sort of thing . " " Then you say you were not a political reporter ? " " I 'm afraid not . " " Now is it not true that in May of nineteen thirty-nine , you were per- suaded by two French communists , Claude Limoget and his wife , Ca- mille Limoget , to undertake a communist mission for them ? " " The way you put it , " Barbara replied , " is an obvious attempt to turn my previous answer into a lie . " " Will you answer the question ! " " And your information comes from my book , " Barbara cried , almost shouting . " I made no secret of it . My book was widely read . It was a book club selection . Thousands of people know exactly what hap- pened . " " Are you going to refuse to answer the question ? " Dixon insisted . " Barbara , please , " Baxter whispered , " answer the question . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I shall answer it . But since you are making a record , I do not want the record to indicate that you have discovered some secret in my life . " She felt herself getting angry and excited , and she told herself , No , that 's no good . Very calm , Bar- bara , very calm . " Please answer the question , " Jay said . " Yes , I undertook a mission for them . But it was not a communist mission . " " How would you characterize it ? " Dixon demanded . " According to your own book , you went into Germany to contact the Communist Party . " " Claude and Camille Limoget were communists . They made no secretof it , " Barbara said quietly . " Will you speak up ! " " I said that the Limogets were communists . I was not . That is why they came to me . They told me that the Communist Party in France had lost all contact with the Communist Party in Germany , that it was desperately important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a journalistwith no communist connections , I could safely enter Germany . " " You say you were not a communist , yet you were willing to enter Nazi Germany at the risk of your life to attempt this contact ? " " I did not consider that I was risking my life . I was a journalist , and my editor was delighted at the thought that I might send some stories out of Germany . " " But you undertook this mission for the Communist Party of France ? " Dixon insisted . " Yes . " " And was it successful ? " " No , " Barbara said softly . " The man was dead . " " Please speak up ! " " No . " " And still you deny that you were ever a member of the Communist Party ? " " I was never a member of the Communist Party . " Dixon leaned back and smiled slightly . " It 's all right , " Baxter whispered . " They 're just making smoke . It 's all right . " Donald @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bridges ? " he asked Barbara . " I know who he is . I do n't know him personally . " " In nineteen thirty-four , Mrs. Cohen , during the incident on the San Francisco waterfront that is remembered as Bloody Thursday , ' did you work at a communist first-aid station ? " " No . I know of no communist first-aid station . I had first-aid equipmentin my car , bandages and that sort of thing , and we helped longshoremenwho were hurt and bleeding . " " What do you mean by we ? " " Myself and a longshoreman . " " What was his name ? " 134 THE ESTABLISHMENT " I ca n't remember . That was fourteen years ago . " jay walked to the table and picked up a sheet of paper . " I have here a sworn deposition by one Manuel Lopez , a San Francisco longshoreman . I will read it for the record . In July of nineteen thirty-four , on the day known as " Bloody Thursday , " I helped to set up a unit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Francisco . The station wagon was owned by Barbara Layette . She worked at the unit hospital . I was then a member of the Communist Party , and I accepted the fact that she was also a member of the Communist Party . ' Will you comment on that , Mrs. Cohen ? " " I certainly will , " Barbara said . " It 's a bare-faced lie . I never knew a Manuel Lopez . There was no unit field hospital , as he calls it . It was a station wagon with some bandages and iodine and peroxide . It had nothing to do with the Communist Party , and I was certainly not a member of the Communist Party , not then or ever . " Jay walked over to the table to confer with the committee members , and Barbara whispered to Baxter , " Harvey , what is this crazy thing with this Lopez ? " " You 're sure you never knew anyone by that name ? " " I 'm absolutely sure . " " Then for some reason they got him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they would suborn a witness , but it 's possible that they 've done just that . Please do n't worry . Your answers are frank and straightforward , and I want you to continue that way . As for this ManuelLopez , if we have to face him in court , I can tear his story to shreds . " " Court ? Harvey , I am not a criminal . What on God 's earth is happeninghere ? " " Barbara , please , please do not get excited . And do n't worry . None of this is as bad as it sounds . " " Oh , Harvey , that is great comfort , " she said bitterly . " None of it is as bad as it sounds . " Jay stepped away from the table and paced slowly back to his former position . He took a small notebook out of his pocket and studied it thoughtfully . Then he snapped it closed and said , " Mrs. Cohen , did you know a man named Marcel Duboise ? " " Yes . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I loved him . We were to be married . " " Then you were never married to him ? " INQUISITION 135 " No . He died before we were to be married . " " I see . What was his occupation ? " " He was a newspaperman . He worked for a French newspaper called Le Monde . " " Did you and Marcel Duboise share the same living quarters in Paris ? " " Do I have to answer that ? " she whispered to Baxter . " It 's in your book , Barbara , so it 's a matter of public record . You could refuse on the grounds that it is n't pertinent , but why not answer it ? " " Yes , " Barbara said to jay , " we did . " " Was Marcel Duboise a member of the Communist Party ? " " No , he was not . " " Was he a member of the International army in Spain , the Fifteenth Brigade , I believe it was called ? " " No , he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Le Monde . " She felt a tightening in her chest . She closed her eyes and breathed deeply . " Could we have a brief recess ? " Baxter demanded . " My client is under great stress . " " I think we could recess for fifteen minutes , " Mankin said magnanimously , " if the lady requires it . " Sitting in a small visitors ' lounge , the door closed against reporters , Baxter suggested that they might have the hearing put off to the following day . " No ! Absolutely not , " Barbara declared . " I want to get it over with and get out of this wretched city . " " Are you sure you 're all right ? " " I 'm all right , Harvey . But what are they doing to me ? They 've twisted everything and turned me into some kind of insane red agent . And this Lopez thing . Who is he ? " " I do n't know and I do n't want you to be disturbed by it . As of this moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Party . That depositionis meaningless . You are telling the truth , and we will stick to that course . I do n't think there is much more to this hearing . " It was small comfort to her , and she was beginning to lose what faith in Harvey Baxter she still possessed . " There is no point in provoking them , " Baxter told her . " Drake is a vindictive man . I should play it very gently , Barbara , and fall back upon the privileges open to you as a woman facing gentlemen . " 136 THE ESTABLISHMENTShe stared at him , wondering whether he had lost his mind . " Gentle-men ? " " Only in a manner of speaking , " Baxter tried to explain . " The more you resist them , the more aggressive they will become . Are you sure you are in a condition to continue ? " " How much longer ? " " A half-hour at the most . I imagine this Lopez was their ace in the hole , so the worst is over . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hearingroom with Harvey Baxter , but no one spoke to her or asked her any questions . Their aloofness chilled her . The congressmen were already seated and waiting . " You are still under oath , " Donald jay reminded her . Pornay , she realized , was leafing through a copy of her first book , the account of her experiences in France and Germany . Jay looked at Pornay , and Pornay nodded . " Your husband 's name is Bernie Cohen . Is that right ? " jay began . " Yes . " " He fought in Spain with the Abraham Lincoln Brigade ? " " Yes . " " Was the Abraham Lincoln Brigade a communist organization ? " " I do n't know . " " Is your husband now or has he ever been a member of the CommunistParty ? " " You do n't have to answer that , " Baxter whispered to her . " I wish to . " And then , raising her voice , she answered , " No , my husband was never a member of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Zionist , which is hardly compatible with membership in the Communist Party . " Jay walked over to the long table , and for a few minutes he and Drake and Pornay talked in whispers . Then he spoke to Mankin . Then he returned to his former position , folded his arms , and said , " You are the chairman of the board of the Layette Foundation . Is that correct , Mrs. Cohen ? " She whispered to Baxter , " Is that pertinent ? Does the foundation come into this ? " " I do n't know how . But if you refuse to answer , Barbara , it will just give them a peg to hang something on . Why not ? " " Yes , I am , " Barbara said . " And what is the purpose of the Layette Foundation ? " INQUISITION 137 " It is a charitable , nonprofit organization that gives financial grants on a broad spectrum , medical , scientific , and artistic . " Again jay consulted with the congressmen . Then he turned to Barbara , stared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What is the Hospital of the Sacred Heart ? " She exchanged glances with Baxter , who was evidently as taken by surprise as she was . He shrugged and nodded . " It 's a hospital in the city of Toulouse , in France , " Barbara replied . " What is your connection with this hospital ? " " Marcel Duboise was taken there after he was wounded in Spain . He died there , " she said softly . " Will the witness speak up ! " Drake snapped . She repeated her answer . " Let me phrase the question differently , " Jay said . " What is your connection with this hospital at the present time ? " " What is this all about ? " Baxter whispered to her . " How does the hospital come into this ? Do you want me to ask for another recess ? Perhapswe should talk about this . " " No , Harvey , " she whispered back . " Let 's finish it . The hospital thing is very simple . " And to Jay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of one hundred thousand dollars to the Hospital of the Sacred Heart in nineteen forty-five . The foundation has also made two subsequent grants to the hospital . " " And what was the purpose of these grants ? " " To establish a wing of the hospital that would care for the wounded survivors of the Republican army who made their way over the Pyrenees and their families . " Then Barbara added , " And since this goes into your record , I would also like the record to show that before these grants were made , we consulted with the proper authorities , and we have written statements to show that the grants were in the proper purviewof the foundation . " She got that out without being interrupted , and she was pleased that she had thought of it . She was in control of herself now , very calm , and to some extent relaxed . Her heart no longer raced . She raised one of her hands and looked at it . It was quite steady . " Did all of these so-called grants come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Yes . " " Were you involved in the raising of any additional funds for the Hospital of the Sacred Heart ? " " Yes . A sum of something over twelve thousand dollars was raised138 THE ESTABLISHMENT INQUISITION 139through private subscription for the purchase of penicillin and other medical supplies . " " Was this an action of the Layette Foundation ? " " No . The Layette Foundation does not raise money from private sources . I undertook this personally . " " And how many persons contributed to this private subscription ? " Barbara thought for a moment , trying to remember the people she had gone to . " Eighteen  --  or nineteen . " " Were any of these people members of the Communist Party ? " " I have no idea . It 's the last thing in the world I would have thought of asking any of them . " Again Jay consulted with the congressmen . Then he walked to one side , and Drake took over . " Mrs. Cohen , " Drake said , " please give the committee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fund of yours . " It was the question Barbara least expected . Afterward , she realized that she should have anticipated it from the very beginning . A tortuous , twisted road of questioning had finally led to it ; still , she should have known . It had always been the same . Every investigation ever undertakenby this committee led to the same goal : names . Names were all they were interested in , names that could be used to spread an everwideningnetwork of fear and suspicion . She thought of one old lady in San Francisco , a woman of eighty-two years , who had given her a thousand dollars because , as she put it to Barbara , " these people fought for our values , my dear . And now they are sick and in need . You do n't desert such people . " Barbara thought of the same old woman brought here to Washington by subpoena , sitting before this committee . She thought about a professor at Berkeley who had given her a hundred dollars . She only had to name him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ University of California , not at any other university . She thought of Dr. Kellman , who had given her two thousand dollars . Would the hospital close its doors to him , refuse him operating privileges ? She had read of such cases . She had read the newspaper accounts of all the hearings before this same committee , read them with that fine air of detachment and security that the average citizen has reading the morning newspaper . And now she was no longer an average citizen . She was sitting in the House Office Building in Washington , and the question was put to her . Harvey Baxter was watching her . " Why does n't he say something ? " she asked herself . Jay was watching her . Drake was watching her , his tiny eyes fixed on her . " No ! " she said. jay said , " You were asked to name the people who contributed to this private fund for the Hospital of the Sacred Heart . Will you please name them . " " No , " Barbara said , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Baxter asked . He whispered to Barbara , " You ca n't refuse to answer , Barbara . It constitutes a contempt . We ca n't even cite the First Amendment , as the Hollywood writers did . It simply does n't apply here . You opened the door , and now you must supply the names they want . " " And become an informer ? And turn people who trusted me over to these pigs ? Are you out of your mind , Harvey ? " " You are my client , and my duty is to my client . I will not allow you to walk into a contempt citation over a ridiculous matter like this . " " Harvey , please shut up , " she whispered ; she said to Jay , " No , Mr. Jay , I have no intention of naming the contributors . " " You realize that we can subpoena your books and records ? " " The only books and records of these contributions are in my head . But if there were books and records , rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wretched hands on them . " " Oh , my God , " Baxter whispered . " Do n't say any more . " " Mrs. Cohen , " Drake said , " do you realize that by refusing to answer this question you are placing yourself in contempt of this committee ? " " I do n't fully understand what that means , " Barbara said slowly . " I would like to think it means that I have contempt for you and your associates . That would be correct . " " We are through with this witness , Mr. Jay ! " Drake shouted over a ripple of noise and laughter from the press . " Get her out of here ! " On the plane back to California , Barbara realized she was actually feelingsorry for Harvey Baxter , and she found herself saying , " Do cheer up , Harvey . It 's not the end of the world , not by any means . We were both of us equally dense in never imagining that it would go this way . " " Why did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your lawyer , Barbara . " " Because it never occurred to me , Harvey . Not in a thousand years could I have guessed that they would care that a few friends of
