THE WIND WILL NOT SUBSIDE : YEARS IN REVOLUTIONARY CHINA , 1964-1969 <P> by DAVID MILTON and NANCY DALL MILTON 397 pages . Pantheon. $1 5 . <P> <P> " I am alone with the masses , waiting , " confided Mao Tse-tung to Andre Malraux in 1965 . <P> The " Great Helmsman " did not wait long . Within months he had launched the century 's most idiosyncratic social upheaval : the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution . It was originally an ideological pursuit of a " handful of people in authority taking the capitalist road " - stigmatizing those who would create a bureaucratic class of privilege as in the U.S.S.R. Later , the revolt degenerated into a witch hunt for the " Black Hands " : i.e. , anyone who opposed the movement . After three years of near anarchy , Mao himself was ready to call off the chase . " The Black Hand is nobody else but me , " he told a group of Red Guards . That tragic admission provides the climax of The Wind Will Not Subside , an absorbing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ David and Nancy Dall Milton were English teachers at Peking 's First Foreign Languages Institute until the Revolution . The couple describe themselves as " Pierres at Borodino , " who , like the character in Tolstoy 's War and Peace , survey the battleground less as participants than as observers . Their experience provides intimate details of the often mysterious doings of the cultural movement . <P> Here are the diplomatic wives who abruptly favor baggy proletarian garb . Here are commonplace people who refuse to take medicine when they are sick ; as the Miltons explain , " denial of the flesh " was the sole means of self-sacrifice demanded by Maoism . When the upheaval spreads fear among " rightists , " many join ultraleftist factions in frantic overcompensation . <P> Little Generals . Intended as a rite of purification , the Cultural Revolution soon becomes a naked power struggle . The issues that concern Mao are lost in sectarian hostilities . Student extremists - the so-called " little generals " - organize combat teams that go at each other in factories and institutes . They skirmish with catapults , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mao asks , " Who could have foreseen this kind of fighting ? " and prepares to let the army restore order . Even then , as the authors indicate , irony is not played out . Parvenu ultraleftists are branded " counterrevolutionary , " and the rightists are restored to power . <P> The story of the Black Hands is as complex as it is gripping . Yet the Miltons tell it without losing their way in the labyrinth of raw material . The Wind Will Not Subside contains occasional patches of grandiloquent prose echoing the stilted polemics of <P> Peking . But the book keeps an appreciative eye out for ambiguity , as when the Great Helmsman personally calls a halt to the Red Guards ' activity . In the students ' fiery intransigence Mao must have seen embers of his own youth . <P> Yet he also recognized the melancholy lesson of his Revolution : fighting for power is far more exhilarating than wielding it .
