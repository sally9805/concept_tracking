Tooling along 1-65 in Alabama , headed for Montgomery , the driver of the green ' 68 Volkswagen checked the road in front of him , then glanced at the papers in his lap and occasionally leaned over to scribble on a yellow legal pad . After 2 hours on the road , Lawyer Morris Dees , 37 , somehow arrived safely at his office . By then he had finished going over the transcript of Johnny Harris ' trial . <P> The day before , Harris , 31 , had been given the death penalty for murdering a prison guard during a 1974 riot at Alabama 's horrendously overcrowded Atmore prison farm . The jury had not bought Defense Attorney Dees ' argument that Harris was singled out because under Alabama law , a lifer who commits first-degree murder must be sentenced to death . Harris was the only lifer involved in the riot . The scribbling that Dees did during his frighteningly industrious drive back from the trial was an outline for Harris ' appeal . It will argue that the verdict went against the weight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wife Maureene and their children , Dees was off again last week to Raleigh , N.C.-this time by plane . He was on his way to consult with attorneys working on the case of Joan Little , 20 , who escaped from a jail in Washington , N.C. , after stabbing the county jailer to death . Little claims that she was defending herself against rape , and Dees was helping to organize a search for evidence to bolster her argument . Many guards in the jail , he contends , regularly extorted sexual favors from women prisoners . <P> Hard Egg . Having set that inquiry in motion , Dees hurried over to Tarboro , N.C. , where three young black men , known as the Tarboro Boys , are charged with the 1973 rape of a white woman , raising echoes of the infamous Scottsboro Boys case in the ' 30s . The defendants claim that their victim consented ; she denies it . Convicted and condemned to death , the three won a reversal on technical grounds . Last week they were supposed to face the same charges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> Energy like Dees ' expended on behalf of so many controversial black defendants explains the lawyer 's reputation as " the second most hated man in the state . " ( No. 1 is Federal Judge Frank Johnson , 56 , whose record of civil rights enforcement long ago won him eminence . ) Dees has earned his ranking quickly : in January 1972 , he was the principal founder of the Southern Poverty Law Center , a public interest group that now has a $400,000 annual budget . In three years S.P.L.C. attorneys have been involved in court fights that ended the use of Alabama county lines as legislative-district boundaries ( thus opening the way to victory for 17 black state legislators ) , forced the U.S. to stop funding the sterilization of welfare mothers and girls under 18 , and integrated the Montgomery Y.M.C.A. , a Louisiana cemetery , a Louisiana ambulance service and the Alabama state troopers.
