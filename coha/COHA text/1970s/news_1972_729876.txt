txt The fraternizing between senior Indian and Pakistani Army officers that took place here after the Pakistani surrender made it all look for a while , as one British journalist put it , " like a tea party following the Eton and Harrow ' match " The implications for the future of India and Pakistan relations have yet to be realized But the cordiality among Indian and Pakistani officers in the top ranks ? many of them old classmates or comrades in arms from the British Army  --  belied the deep anger and humiliation which many Pakistani officers and soldiers feel over their defeat Look at history boOks ' For these men , a carefully nurtured myth of invincibility has been shattered The Hindus , whom many of them hold in contempt , somehow got the best of them And now that the shooting has stopped , they have plenty of time to think about that unacceptable fact . At the moment , the men of the defeated Pakistani Army in the east are prisoners of the Indians Thousands of them are still in camps in Dacca . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are to be transferred to India From there , it may be a long time before they are finally allowed to return home to West Pakistan But when they do return , it will probably be no easy task to absorb these embittered men back into the West Pakistani Army or into civilian life Lt Gen A A K ( Tiger ) Niazi , the Pakistani commander in Dacca , had maintained over and over again that the Muslim soldiers of West Pakistan had never been defeated before ( " Just look at your history books , " he told reporters shortly before all-out war erupted ) And after the war started , when things began to look bad for the Pakistanis , the general contended that he would fight " to the last " Compliments recalled The trouble was that many of his men believed all this talk Whether General Niazi himself did was more difficult to say . He had a way of fending off probing questions by telling jokes . According to an Indian general who saw him off at the Dacca airport just before he was flown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telling jokes ? " one after another " ? right up to the moment he stepped on the airplane . Of course , the general is going to be well cared for One Indian major general continually referred to General Niazi , a former classmate , as ' ' a very dear friend , " " He 's a fine man , " the Indian general said . " I 've known him for a very long time , and he was only doing his duty " The Indians were most complimentary to the Pakistanis in the post-surrender period , constantly praising them for having put up a good fight , // *Disillusioned officers and future // The Pakistanis , said an Indian paratroop colonel , were " good , very good soldiers " But we knew that before the war started , " he added , The Indians knew they were up against tough enemy , and they carefully planned the kind of war they were going to fight for months before it ever began In contrast , the Pakistanis ' feeling of superiority over the Indians caused them badly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem to realize until the all-out fighting started how much the Indian Army had improved since the war of 1965 Officer comments Typically , one young Pakistani officer on the northern border commented shortly before the outbreak of the war " We have a cause to fight for The Indians have no cause . They only think of their families . " They are not very good soldiers . They make a dash for it when the first shot is fired " The trouble was that the Indians did not make a dash for it They just kept on coming A little more than two weeks after he made his derisive comments about the Indians , the young officer found himself their prisoner This correspondent had dinner with Brig . Qadir Khan , commander of the Pakistani 93rd Infantry Brigade , two days before the war started The brigadier was a genial man witn a great bristling moustache He was fond of quoting Persian poetry and saying , in a very British way , " Well , gentlemen , what 's the drill " We were sitting in comfortable chairs with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dinner and listening to All India Radio when the radio announcer said that the fall of the town of Jessore to the rebel Mukti Bahini was " imminent " and might come within a week Everyone , including the brigadier , who had told me earlier that Indian officers had not even dared to lead their men into East Pakistan during their cross-border forays , scoffed at the Indian claim concerning Jessore . But Jessore fell , not to the Mukti , of course , but to the Indians , within less than a week , as the Indian radio had predicted Within less than two weeks , the Indians had captured the brigadier himself as well as a number of the staff officers who were sitting with us that evening . Because the Indians were lenient with the Pakistanis after their surrender , it was possible to go and talk with Pakistani prisoners at their former military headquarters in Dacca On one visit to the Pakistanis I met a young , but distinguished , officer whom I had come to know before the war started His post-surrender mood seemed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brief me on what had happened to his battalion during the war . He reined in his emotions and gave a factual , restrained account of all the hard fighting his unit had seen over the previous two weeks . But when it came to describing the Pakistani surrender and the point at which his battalion received the order to stop fighting , the officer became visibly moved " The order came for us to cease firing , and very reluctantly We obeyed the order , " he managed to say Then he slipped on a pair of dark glasses ? so that I could not see the tears welling up in his eyes .
