When 1 was a third-grade boy I gave my penknife to a girl named Cara O'Cool because she was the most beautiful thing I had ever seen and I loved her completely . That simple circumstance , had I the wit to recognize it , prophesied a lifelong pattern of falling in love with things and might even have foretold that in middle life I would fall in love with the New York Yankees . There were other signs , too . Like most youngsters growing up with any capacity for games ? was addicted to every stick and ball game known to man ? I played sandlot and schoolboy base-hall from the moment spring melted the snow from a muddy field until it was time for football , which in those days had the grace to wait until summer was over . Thousands of hours were spent " taking infield , " even if it consisted of a pal hitting ground balls across his back yard . In my teens I was always Crosetti . Frank Crosetti , the peerless Yankee shortstop . We all emulated some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Jack Carey was Red Rolfe . But 1 was really Crosetti : built like him . moved like him , thought like him . When I 'd make an especially good stop , I 'd yell exuberantly , " Hey , did ya see the Cro get that one ? " Or the other kids would shout , " The way to look , Crosetti . " Of course , I had never seen Crosetti . But he was my hero and he was a Yankee . The changing seasons swept me past Cara O'Cool 's third grade and adolescent imitations of the Cro . Football turned out to be my thing and I went to college to do that . Then came a war and later a course of livelihood that took a tangent far from haseball ? several years in Europe , then back to America to run Ringling Bros . Barnum and Bailey Circus , whose season started be-fore and ended long after baseball 's . One gray September afternoon I found myself sitting in Yankee Stadium , president of the Club , surrounded by 413 disconsolate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perennial World Champions , mired in the American League cellar for the first time in half a century , lose another game . Friends thought 1 was out of my mind ; enemies protested I had no right to be there under any circumstances . But for my part I was ecstatically happy . I had fallen in love , again , with the New York Yankees . It is reasonable to wonder why a dormant emotion should well up so warmly after so many years . Partly instinct , I think . The instinct that draws one back toward one 's natural self , to natural things . Instincts , if they are any good , usually tell you what to do long before your head figures it out . Also , after a rather peripatetic life , I had a pretty good perspective on the open options . So I made certain my head was running on the same track as my heart , and concluded in that cellar year of 1966 I wanted most in the world to be a Yankee . It 's a boy 's game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proportion to the living of life . It does n't pretend to be a basic commodity like oil , or grain or fish from the sea . But it is a vivid , lively part of the American fabric . Withdraw it and the whole scene would be imbalanced . ( Where else would we vent all that personal expression , for one thing ? ) There must be , particularly in our insistently technological society , some romantic quality , some ability to escape from the hard world of fact . Baseball is a beguiling place to go . Admission to a ball park buys instant respite from the frenetic pace and uncertain values of the real world , where mechanization obscures the point that the most important element in all of life is a human being . But in a few strides ? through a turnstile , down a ramp and along an aisle to a seat ? baseball quickly re-establishes the individual . One man with a bat challenges one man with a ball . A young man poised alone on a mound pits his skill and courage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ atone beside a rubber plate . The essence of this contest is fundamental to man 's nature and as unending in its appeal as the cowboy and his horse against the elements . The ball park itself remains an oasis in a city desert of steel and concrete . Life slips back to a human scale ; soft grass rests the eye and white-uniformed players , gracefully positioned in defense , stand clearly visible . In contrast to the wound-tight world outside , the game unfolds at an ordered pace and drama builds around its split-second timing and precise geometry . There is no uncertainty about individual performance , no waiting for Monday 's films to discover who did what , no sharing error with unidentifiables . The shortstop glides in front of a ground ball , scoops it up and throws all in one flowing motion . Or he boots it . The center fielder in a minor miracle of timing spears a line drive at sprinter 's speed ; or it bounces off the heel of his glove , irrevocably . No assignment of blame elsewhere . One individual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see . It is especially so in the batter 's box . Four or five times a day ? twice that in a doubleheader ? a batter , alone and exposed , steps to the plate and lays his talent on the line . No equivocation . No quarter asked or given . Only the exhilaration of a hit and the dash down the base line , or the humiliation of a strikeout and the excruciating journey back to the dugout . Elation and depression . The human condition operates on every pitch , physically and emotionally . A player is wrenched from the heights to the depths and back again every day . His guts must be made of rawhide to endure his highly visible trade . He can not allow a mistake , or a series of them , or boos from the crowd ( ya bum , ya ! ) to upset his finely tuned physical and psychological equilibrium ; his sport demands more keenly honed skills than any other . The Yankee lineup on opening day , 1970 , included a 22-year-old catcher and a 21-year-old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of whom had yet played a hundred professional ball games . The pressure on them was intense . Both had been sensational during spring training . But when the official season started , Munson got one hit in his first thirty times at bat ; Ellis two in thirty-seven . This is about as close to total disaster as a boy can come and survive . Both survived dramatically ? Munson became Rookie of the Year and Ellis established himself as the Yankee power hitter of the next decade because in addition to their exceptional ability to hit and throw , they have the inner tensile strength to cope with initial failure without coming apart at the seams . And because Ralph Houk , their manager , understands that 80 percent of his job is psychological ( how to deal with that sensitive factor effectively ) ? to help a boy get the most from himself ? is a large measure of his own uncommon talent . It sends me up the wall to hear some cynic 's opinion that hoots and jeers do n't bother a ballplayer ? " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about . " Nonsense . Absolute nonsense . A major league ballplayer wears his pride on his sleeve . He dies when he strikes out or hits into a double play , and rages against himself when a ball slithers between his legs for an error . There is no way to become inured to that kind of public embarrassment . Even long-retired stars returning to play in lighthearted old-timers ' games ? no longer paid , no longer expected to perform well ? are loath to look bad . That intense professional pride never diminishes . Two incidents , coupled together , dominated Mantle 's decision that he had reached the limit of his time : As a pinch hitter in two successive all-star games , he struck out . His embarrassment was too devastating to bear . Raw courage would carry him no farther . Like all good people , Mantle was hard on himself . Imagine for a moment putting yourself on public display . You work for the telephone company , an insurance firm , an auto manufacturer , or whatever , and are summoned up before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best shot . Right now . No discussion . No consultation with colleagues . No reference back to committee . You alorie . Now . Add to that figurative plight your fellow workers looking on , a stadium full of people who paid to watch you deliver , and a television camera focused in on your wet hands and anxious expression . Do you begin to feel the lump coming up ? And would you like to repeat this three or four more times today ? And again tomorrow ? Put your mind to that the next time you go to a ball game . And by the way , have you ever been booed by 60,000 people for blowing a sale ? Professional ballplayers , even as you and I , are not numbers on IBM cards . There are no statistics playing baseball . Under numbered shirts and caps shading their features , they are uniquely skilled young men with hearts , minds and sensibilities , with the same strengths and frailties that inhabit all of us , engaged in an acutely human profession . They bring a heroic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it from its crude sandlot form to some magical mix of art and science . They are an elite corps . Two hundred million of us in America produce only 600 sons good enough to play major league baseball , some better than others . Yaz , Killebrew , Torre ? and their like ? can focus on a missile hurtled at them from 60 feet away at 80 or 90 miles an hour , jumping , sliding , curving , sinking - doing all the improbable things the Gibsons , McNallys and Stottlemyres can make a baseball do - lash the bat around at the exact inch of error - and hit it solidly . Neither you nor I could hit Gibson if he took something off his change-up . Or threw it underhand . " Very well , " conceded an acquaintance of mine whose summer life style has turned to country clubs and sailing boats , " I 'll admit it 's a very difficult game to play , but does anyone care ? Is n't it all rather anachronistic ? You know , a quaint tradition , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough . " Think of it - not enough violence . Must there be blood on everything ? Violence in the streets , violence on the campuses , violence in Southeast Asia . Even NFL violence every autumn Sunday afternoon in such abundance that by mid-January the two Super teams are so physically and emotionally exhausted they are incapable of playing up to their native ability . It is the essential nonviolence of baseball that makes the game more , rather than less , attractive to millions of Americans who are beginning to gag at the sight of still another bashed head or twisted limb . And what can be so bad about a little anachronism if it means that a handful of favorite things stay fixed , like the Plaza Hotel or Buckingham Palace , or the same sheep grazing on the same Irish slope , or an Elm Street somewhere still lined with elms ? Or indeed a classic game whose graceful rhythms and patterns have en dured a hundred years and will for a hundred more , connecting us vicariously to simple truths about ourselves and saving us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is so compelling about swiftness and change anyhow , when most of us would like nothing better than to catch our breath and our balance ? And where better to do that than at a baseball game ? Something extraordinary happens in a ball park ; there are no strangers , only friends one has not met . Every neighbor is a neighbor in the most unself-conscious sense . Fans share a common proprietorship , an involvement , an identification with the players and with one another . The whole scene is hooked up by invisible wires , and communal juices flow through an event which is part sporting competition , part picnic and part town meeting . It is n't professionals performing and spectators looking on . The fans are part of every play . Stand outside the stadium some day and listen to the rise and fall , the tempo and texture of the crowd-sounds . You can follow the game without seeing an inning . Exhilaration and depression , ecstasy and desolation wash back and forth . Personal expression is everybody 's right . The same hot dogs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mezzanine box . It is not possible to be lonely or left out of this simple , lively , democratic process . The best Stadium Happening may be the very young . Their wide wonderment , their sober concentration , their brimming anticipation - it is to weep for joy simply to know that it still exists unblemished . Papa 's loyalties may be fixed on Ruth or Di Mag . Crosetti may be perennial folk hero . But who can prove to a lad of ten that his Bench or his Munson or his Tony C. is n't equally herioc ? Or that the pop foul he caught off Oliva 's bat is n't as precious as Ted Williams ' homerun ball you recovered in the Fenway Park bleachers in some ancient time ? Next best may be the next youngest , if there are any gradations at all . The high school and college-aged kids . We like them in our ball park ; they come and lend us their liveliness . Last spring , though , they erupted in what some newspapers called a mini-riot . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school kids and they got restless as the afternoon stretched out . Paper cups , apple cores , and rubber balls bombarded the field - just for the hell of it . Then two or three thousand swarmed over the fences after the last out in the ninth inning , thinking the game was over . It was n't . It was still tied . The running-wilds had to be coaxed back into the stands with the warning that the Yanks might have to forfeit the game . A lot of hand wringing and finger pointing followed . Writers wrote : Burke ( " too permissive " ) wanted them ; he got them ; now what 's he going to do with them ? Similar unruliness had broken out at the same time in Chicago and I think Pittsburgh . Concern about orderliness and safety was genuine . The inclination was to clamp down , taking physical precautions like wiring in the bleachers . We rejected that . It seemed out of joint with the whole purpose of baseball . And offensive . Instead , we appealed to their better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ especially to their strong sense of identification with our very young ball team . Ellis , 21 ; Munson , 22 ; Kline , 21 ; Murcer , 24 ; Kenney , 24 , were all one of them , not one of us elder types in the generation spread . We wrote a message in longhand , had it blown up and hung as signs all over the Stadium : The response was instantaneous and complete . For the balance of the season not a single object , paper airplane or youngster sailed onto the field . Their ball park manners were super . We love them for that and for a host of other good reasons . The young - certainly the vast majority of the young - are the best ever . For that matter , so are the very old , if being an octogenarian is old . They add a certain grace to the proceeding . Admittedly , I 'm demented about anyone who comes to the stadium - even to root for our favorite rivals , the Red Sox . Stately Jim Farley , formal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and delicate Marianne Moore in her tricorn hat , " an ingenue of 82 , " set the style and tone for those who have been around a bit longer . Their enthusiasm is equal ; their perspectives differ . Mr. Farley still takes the first baseman 's view , rooted in his 1917 position on the Grassy Point , New York Alphas , and ripened by another half century 's experience watching all the New York teams from McGraw and McCarthy to Houk . Miss Moore , who keeps her fielder 's glove under her bed , sees the game in the visual images of poetry . Mickey , leaping like the devil why gild it , although deer sounds better - snares what was speeding towards its treetop nest , one-handing the souvenir-to-be meant to be caught by you or me. and It 's a pitcher 's battle all the way - a duel - u catcher 's , as , with cruel puma paw , Elston Howard lumbers lightly back to plate . * Marianne Moore is obviously more perceptive than most of us . The space @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the rest of America - opera star Robert Merrill and a plumber , Pearl Bailey and a nun , pianist Eugene Istomin and a house painter , Mrs. Onassis and a schoolteacher , Dean Rusk and a milkman , Whitney Young and an airline stewardess , Simon and Garfunkel and any two guys named Eddie - all equal participants in this game that 's more than game and each relishing favorite memories of the best game , best play , best player he ever saw , I have my own , of course - and I 'd be happy to listen to yours sometime . Oddly enough , it was not my first major league game that my father took me to at age 10 , where we saw the aging Babe hit one of his 714 home runs - though that 's an indelible memory . Nor was it Mantle 's unforgettable homer in the bottom of the ninth inning of the third game of the 1964 World Series against St. Louis , breaking a one-to-one tie .

Houk signaled the bullpen . The crowd thought the public address announcer had gone bonkers , but their incredulous eyes confirmed it was indeed the Rock striding purposefully toward the mound hallowed by the incomparable Whitey Ford , Lefty Gomez , Red Ruffing . A mounting roar moved from stunned disbelief through astonished delight to wild enthusiasm for the sheer bravado of it . His first pitch was a plate-splitting strike to a bemused batter and an ear-splitting cheer for Colavito . A weak fly ball retired him . One out for Rocky : he could have been elected Borough President of the Bronx on the spot . Two more easy outs and Whitey never walked . off the mound with greater aplomb . Serious , gentlemanly Colavito , who always respectfully lipped his hat to the president 's lady as he passed her dugout box , turned a simple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheered every pitch , roared on every out , and gave him a standing ovation at the end of every inning survived as he set down batter after batter and his transcendent teammates got him six poetic runs off Mickey Lolich . Winning pitcher , Colavito . Lifetime record : Won I , Lost ? 0 . But it was a day for the cup to run over . Rocky played the second game in right field his gallant , undefeated arm hanging limp by his side . And of course the hitter , returned to his last , hit a game-winning home run to sweep the four-game series from the incipient World Champs . How could anyone absorb more happiness in one day ? That is , until 1 he next Yankee pennant is won . The thing is that an unforget ; table can happen any day and does , as you boys who follow baseball know , wherever you fall in the age scale .
