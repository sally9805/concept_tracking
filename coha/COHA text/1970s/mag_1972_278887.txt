The Stockholm conference has approved a global system for the monitoring of pollution . Next month , as a forerunner of such a system , the U.S. plans to launch an experimental satellite , known as ERTS ( for Earth Resources Technology Satellite ) . A stubby , 1,965-lb. package that resembles an overgrown moth , the satellite will be equipped with three television cameras , a multi-wave-length sensor and a data collection system that can relay environmental information from as many as 1,000 automatic monitoring stations on earth . If the test is successful , ERTS-type orbiters could be used to sound an alarm whenever there is a threat of serious environmental danger : contamination of the seas , climatic changes , even volcanic eruptions . <P> Fired to an altitude of 492 nautical miles , the satellite is expected to operate for a year in a near-polar orbit that runs almost parallel to the earth 's axis of rotation . Sweeping down from high above the Arctic Circle to Antarctica , it will then head back north every 103 minutes . This orbit has an important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same spot on earth every 18 days at almost exactly the same time of day . Thus , ERTS 's photographs , each covering a 100-by-100-mile square , will be taken at each particular site under lighting conditions that remain unchanged except for the gradual seasonal variations in the angle of the sun and different cloud covers . Such consistency gives ERTS a unique ability to spot changes on the earth . <P> Built by General Electric for NASA 'S Goddard Space Flight Center under a $174.6 million program , ERTS can not see objects smaller than 300 ft. across , but it has very acute color perception . Each of its three RCA TV cameras responds to a distinctly different wave length of light-green , red and near-infra-red . Transmitted to earth , the three separate images can readily be combined into a single , detailed color picture , and ERTS can produce a total of 9,200 pictures a week . <P> ERTS 's infra-red scanners can perform more subtle detective work , since every object , living or inanimate , emits or reflects the various wave lengths of infra-red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a key chemical involved in the production of oxygen by green plants , has a very distinctive infra-red " fingerprint . " Thus , by the color variations in photos , future ERTS satellites could quickly detect any large-and possibly dangerous - change in the chlorophyll content of ocean plankton , a principal source of the world 's oxygen supply . By similar " fingerprinting , " ERTS and its successors could warn of changes in the health of woodlands , detect harmful acidity in soil , find clues to new oil and mineral deposits , and perhaps even sniff out illegal fields of opium poppies .
