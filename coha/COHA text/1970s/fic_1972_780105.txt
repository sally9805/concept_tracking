 | sion , to seat the nobles and high of the court . It went clear around three sides and was draped most gloriously with the king 's own colors , and the supports were crusted with gold leaf . The lords and ladies , bright as jackdaws in their fine clothes , chattered and laughed the whole time ; one would have thought they were at a play with mummers and clowns , instead of the highest law court of the land . Some of the ladies still wore the silly horned headdress from Bohemia in the dead queen 's honor ; it was the ugliest fashion I ever can recall and made them look like painted cows . I was glad my own Lady Kat wore a simple Cathay silk caul , though for sure nothing could have made a cow of her . It was long waiting , there in the stands ; in the field below , the heralds ' horses pawed the ground . Then a ripple went over all the crowd , as of wheat bending in the breeze , and someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was the king . They said he loved homage and the show of worship ; it must have been a full minute that he stood , watching us all kneeling there . I raised my head a little and stole a look ; the wind caught my bonnet , blowing it off my head . I grabbed for it and missed , falling against T'om . We both straightened quickly , but I saw Richard turn toward us , and , trembling , I fancied I could feel his kingly frown . When he gave the signal to rise , I could not take my eyes off him ; even so far away , one could see that he was encrusted stiff with jewels , like an image in a rich cathedral . So thick they were t hat no color of his clothes showed beneath , though I had heard , always , that he wore cloth of gold . His hair and beard , too , were gold , and shone in the afternoon sun , with an Eastern pomade , men said , that cost ten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so long that they turned up nigh to his knees and were fastened somewhere , by ribbons , to his high hose . My own new shoes were pointed , and twice as long as my foot , so that it was hard to walk without stumbling ; I could not imagine how Richard could move at all . It is a fashion that has since gone out of style , I thank dear Jesus ; conceive , if you will , of such gauds on the march ! I gave over marveling at the king 's looks , for the trumpets sounded then , and a herald , wearing our colors , rode forward from the field to stand before the king . His horse , too , was richly  | caparisoned with our own Bolingbroke arms , and wore a mantle that reached the ground . We heard his voice , rich and ringing , trained to reach a thousand ears . " My sovereign Lord , Richard of Bordeaux and England , most puissant ruler of this realm , I salute you in the name of Henry of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called Bolingbroke . This lord says , and I also for him , that Thomas Mowbray , Duke of Norfolk , is a false traitor to your royal majesty and the whole kingdom ! Further , Lord Henry charges that said Norfolk received eight thousand nobles for the payment of the garrison at Calais , which sum he kept for himself , witnessed by Lord Henry . Further , said Norfolk has been the cause of all the treasons against your Kingly Person in the past eighteen years . Finally , Lord Henry proposes to prove this with his , Henry 's , body against that of Norfolk in lawful combat in the lists . " The herald wheeled his horse and rode back to the Lancaster party . Then another herald rode forth , bearing the crimson and silver of Norfolk , who declared that everything said against his master was false and a slanderous lie , that the duke  --  but here were cries from the stand of " Louder speak up ! " and the man 's voice was drowned out . Out rode another knight , all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of bees when a stick has been thrust into it . I heard " Mowbray . . . the duke ! " and looked hard at this man , the enemy to my father . He was bareheaded , and never did I see a face so bedeviled with anger . My own father could not hold a rushlight to it , and him I have seen often in a black fury . Mowbray 's voice too , was like a clarion , hoarse and loud ; after the curtesie-trained heralds he bellowed like a bull , and some of the ladies tittered . The king held up his hand , glittering with rings , for silence , and we heard Mowbray shout , sputtering , that Lancaster was a vile dung-thrower , and worse , that he , Mowbray , had used his monies properly , in all good faith , for the king , and that never , never did he plot against him . He beseeched the king to allow him combat against this false accuser . Richard stood , all eyes upon him , saying nothing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the waiting , pulled his horse , pawing , into the air and rode to where my father stood . He dismounted , his armor clanking beneath his robe of state , and grabbed the reins of my father 's charger . After that , all happened so fast I could not see rightly , but I think my father jumped from  | his horse to close with him , and the two were pulled apart by those who stood there . Richard spoke then , or shouted rather . " Peace ! . . . I command you . . . Peace ! " His voice was high as a woman 's but piercing , and the thin vowel sound of " Peace " shocked like a shriek . I saw my father then , still held by two knights , pull off his gauntlet and hurl it . It did not fall , as in knightly practice , at the man 's feet , but hit him full in the face . Even from our place in the stands we could see the blood run from Mowbray 's nose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood a moment , watching , then turned and resumed his throne , taking from a courtier nearby a goblet  --  wine perhaps or mead  --  from which he drank . The stands were silent then ; the only sound was the neighing of the frightened horses , loud in the still moment . Richard beckoned his own herald to him , a man almost as bejeweled as himself , and sat leaning over the parapet talking with him low . Then , with a sudden flurry , he rose , waved his flashing hand in a languid half-gesture to the crowd , turned on his heel , and left , followed by half the stands , his court . There was more silence , with shufflings and murmuring and high , nervous laughter , while Richard 's herald wrote something on a long sheet . Then , standing , he advanced to the space before the throne . " Good people , " he read . " Lords of London and Peers of the Court , our most puissant King Richard , Monarch of England and Heir to Bordeaux and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nobles , Lancaster and Norfolk , dukes created by His Grace , and subject to his will , will place body against body in the lists , fighting to the death . The place of combat will be Coventry , in the tourney field , and the time , in this year of Our Lord , will be September , the sixteenth day . May right go with the victor . . . Good people , your king bids you go in peace ! " Toni , beside me , shouted for joy and clapped his hands , but the beautiful voice of ' the herald rang in my head like a mourning bell , for I was old enough by then to know fear .  | All that September our kin rode to us , through the ripening wheat , for the combat trial would be at Gosford Green , outside Coventry , just twenty miles away from our castle . Kenilworth , though a massive place , was crowded to bursting , and some of the men-at-arms had to bed down in the courtyard . Each of our family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; Lady Kat was busy from sunup to setting , just seeing to the feeding of such a multitude . I remember her in her shift , her bare arms still round and pretty , laughing as she took over the churn from a dairy maid , or in the big kitchen , flushed from the ovens , all floury to the elbows as she kneaded dough for honey cakes . Once I backed away quietly , coming upon my Grandfather Gaunt , his white beard nuzzling into her nape as he stood behind her in the counting house , his big , veined hands on her breasts . I had thought him too old by far for such play . Most of our fine ladies , in their home manors , could turn to and make such delicacies as marchpane , or they might candy the big chestnuts from their own trees , but his Katrin , as he called her , had been reared as a lay pupil in a poor convent and had learned all the homely arts . Some of the duchesses spoke hard of her for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but I never saw her take offense , even at flagrant sneers ; she had the long love-faith of the highest noble in the land , next to the king , and wished for no more . In those days I was sure God would send me such a one as her , for in the minstrels ' songs there are so many ladies of great heart and soul , and passion too . I have had many women , but only one I ever met was anything near to Lady Kat , and she was taken from me . All my mother 's kin came , those I had not seen since her funeral ; my Grandmother Joan came , that harsh old lady , straight as a poplar we called her Granny Gallow-post , but not to her face and with her her daughter , our Aunt Eleanor . We boys had a name for her , too ; we called her the Purse . She had a mouth small and tight , with little wrinkles all around it , and no lips at all ; when it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tight . She was very rich , too , in her own right , and had married wealth as well . She wore the latest fashions , no matter how ugly , and her thin face was caked with paint from Paris ; she had an unpleasant odor , too , like mutton , I thought . My father said she used a perfume from the Eastern lands that was made from the spleen of a great fish , but this I could not credit . No one liked her ; she had plagued my father with lawsuits before my mother 's death , and after , too , trying to get her hands on my mother 's inheritance . She had some trumped-up case that my mother had forfeited her share by having been a novice nun ; it could never hold water and was thrown out of the law courts time and again , but there was much coldness between her and Father . I could not fathom why she had come for the combattrial , seeing this was so ; Father said she came to gloat , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there might be after ; it was a grisly thought and frightened me . My uncles Beaufort came , too ; Uncle Thomas from London , where he said that in the taverns there , the odds on my father were two to one against Mowbray . My blood ran cold to think of men putting their wagers on my father 's head as cold as upon a cockfight or a Shrove Tuesday football match . Father laughed , though , and took great heart from it ; he had been practicing with lance and spear all that summer , and his muscles were like hands of ' iron . Father had been close to us all that time of waiting and even at moments almost tender . He gave us horses of our own that summer , " Tour and me , and John and little Humphrey had ponies brought from Scotland , sweet-faced little beasts with long manes and tails that almost reached the ground . We had lances , too , and shields ; mine was emblazoned with our emblem of antelopes , the Lancaster arms , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I am only eleven months younger than Hal , but he gets everything ! " My father took him onto his knee and spoke gravely for once ; I think he must have had a qualm or two about the contest and wanted things made clear to us boys , in case . " Hal is older , though it be by so little , and that means he will inherit all the titles . You will have lands and manors in your own right , when I am gone , and John and Humphrey , too , but Hal is the first-born . . . . " He punched Tom gently in the jaw , a play blow , with his great fist , and went on . " Think , too , Tom who is  | it that we beat when you are both in wrong , when you are both to blame ? " Tom 's sobs sank into soft hiccups , and his face brightened . " Why , Hal , " he said , laughing . " Hal is our whipping boy ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " It is because he is the heir that he is used so ill . . . he must learn strength and fortitude , and to take all responsibilities . . . he must bear the fortunes of our house , and so must have hard shoulders . . . you would not grudge him a little show of arms  --  for all he has suffered ? It seems but fair , little Tom . . . . " And he laughed , hugging him . He did not hug me , but , as he looked at me , I fancied I saw a look such as he might give a man grown , and my throat swelled with pride , so that I had to swallow the ready tears . My father had never spoken so before ; I thought it made up somewhat for the hard blows he had given me from my earliest remembrance . Still , in my bed that night , I wept softly into my pillow ; if only he had held me , too , in his arms , or touched me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! On the combat day , my father left before sunup , and fully half the household with him ; only us children and the guest children were left behind , with the Lady Kat and our Grandmother Joan . Those ladies might have gone too , for Joan Waring and all the maidservants were at hand to tend the younger babes , but Lady Kat had a soft and squeamish heart and never liked even to watch a mock tourney , far less this trial to the death , and our ramrod of a Granny had her own firm ideas about the matter . She went about the house muttering ; I heard " barbaric , " and , with scorn , " Sweet Richard ! " I asked her what she meant , for in my great unease I had forgotten my fear of her . She glared at me , as if this day 's work had been all my doing , and said , " Boy , listen well  --  the day will come when this custom will be outlawed , this death combat . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around a bonfire naked and painted . . . It proves nothing , only that one hog is bigger than another or that one wolf has more teeth ! " I could not love her for likening my father to a hog , or a wolf even , but there was sense in her words . If Mowbray dies , I thought , my father will then be proclaimed right and all his treason-accusing true , but all Mowbray 's kin will hate us Lancasters to the end of time , and so it will go the other way also . I could not think it through though , for my thoughts were on my father 's peril , and in my head the scene was vivid and awful , no matter  | how I tried to shake it out , of my father lying dead and broken on the fading grass of Gosford Green , while the people gawked between the rails and jostled one another for the sight . Even , I thought , if Father is unhorsed only and thrown upon the ground , it will count in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if both are left alive , the loser in points will go to the headsman 's block . The Lady Kat saw me , where I lurked in corners and drummed my fingers upon the window , and bent to me , saying , " Hal , will you not go out into the sunshine . . . I hear Tom and the others playing . It will ease your mind . . . . " I went out into the courtyard . All of the children were there , except the littlest , playing at trial-by-combat . Even the little girls , my sisters , and the other small damsels sat , playing at great ladies , with silken barbettes pilfered from their mothers ' chests covering their hair , giggling and shouting , while Tom and one of the younger pages galloped their horses and thrust out their lances . Little Humphrey sat , solemn and haughty , among the baby countesses , wearing a paper crown . I could not stay to watch , for just then my stomach gave a great heave , and I thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ran , my hand over my mouth , around the kitchen garden to the midden heap , where we boys often went to make water when we were caught short out of doors . There I squatted , among the garbage , vomiting and purging until I was empty and weak , while the helpless tears ran down my face . Small wonder , I thought , that Father called me puny ; none other of the children are taken this way . " Dear , Jesus , " I vowed , still squatting , " I promise to hold my bowels if you will save my father this day . . . Sweet Jesus , save my father ! " It is a vow I was never able to keep ; later I learned that the hardiest of knights are afflicted in this way often and often , before battle , so perhaps it was simply that I was older than ' loin and the others and my insides more aware . When 1 could move , I crept around the outer bailey , so none could see , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but then it had seemed easy . " There were no handholds in the rounded stone walls , and the circling stairs made me dizzy , after my weakness in the midden , but when I reached the top I was glad . The air up there was fresh and stinging , where the wind blew from the north , and I could see far , far , along the road to Gosford Green . I do not know how long I stood there , straining  | my eyes into the distance , before I saw a great cloud of dust far away on the road , and moving slowly nearer . I clutched the bars of the little high window until my hands went clammy and I had to wipe them on my hose ; the iron was rusty and left long redbrown smudges . I thought , even through my fear , of the scolding I would get from Grandmother , or the knuckle-whack , perhaps . As I watched , a small dust-cloud separated from the larger one , and a party of riders galloped up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the bars , my muscles straining , for the window was high , so that I could see down into the courtyard below . The riders had dismounted and were pulling off their helms ; I saw my Grandfather Gaunt 's thin white hair , and beside him the carrot-red of my father , flattened by his headpiece . My heart , or something there in my chest , turned right over , and I turned and flew down those treacherous stone steps ; my feet , I swear , never touched them , so light with joy they were . Though I was fast , Father had come into the great hall before me ; when I saw his face , I stopped in my tracks . I could read no triumph there ; his eyes were as grim as death . He saw me staring and shook himself a little , like a dog that has lain too long by the fire . He rubbed his face all over with his big hand , massaging the welt on his forehead that the helm had left and running his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a cockscomb . Then he gave a great sigh , looked at me as if he did not see me , and said shortly , " We did not fight . " Then , turning on his heel , he went out of the room to an inner chamber somewhere , his armor clanking in the silence . The little group of us stood like stone for a moment ; I saw my grandmother 's face , anger beginning to creep on it , and behind her , in the doorway , the Lady Kat , round-eyed . My Grandfather Gaunt waved them away and sank wearily onto a carved bench before the fireplace . The fire was all but out , I remember , but he held out his hands to it as if it flamed steadily . They shook ; he reached up and unclasped the pin at his shoulder , letting his cloak fall to the floor , staring all the while at the charred log in the hearthplace . Finally , he waved the men-at-arms away and beckoned me to him , saying we were not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still . He said , finally , not looking at me , " You see your father unhurt , Henry ? "  | " Yes , my lord . " " The king would not let them fight . . . The earl marshal had thrown down the Lancaster gage , and your father had set spurs , even , to his horse Richard flung his scepter out onto the field and stopped them . . . . " I saw his face and dared not answer . He had turned to me , and it seemed I had never really looked at my grandsire before . It was the same face , all bold lines , and full of a harsh pride , but I saw something else . Something old , old , and infinitely weary ; the eyes had a thousand years in them . He spoke as though he spoke to the wall , or to himself perhaps . " These twenty years I have served Richard setting the kingdom above my own interests or my sons ' . . . For twenty years I watched them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . I have watched . . . and I have known , inside myself , but putting the thought aside , that these two these cousins  --  might well destroy one another . . . it has begun . " He still sat on , staring at nothing . I still dared not speak ; I heard , from far away , my brothers and sisters , clamoring still , in the courtyard . They had not even heard my father 's party ride up . After a long moment , the old duke said , " This day your father is banished from the kingdom for ten years . " " Oh , sire " I cried , the words catching in my throat . He nodded . " The king himself pronounced punishment . " I felt something flare in me , and hot , angry water smarted behind my eyes . " The king is unjust , " I cried . " The king is cruel ! " " He is the king , " said my grandfather heavily . " But ten years ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I shall be a man grown before I see him again . . . I shall be twenty-one ! " " They are at least both alive . . . " said my grandfather . " Be thankful , Harry , you are not Mowbray 's son . . . Mowbray is banished for life . " I could not take comfort in a stranger 's woe ; it seemed to me as though my father might as well have been laid beside my mother in her grave . " Oh , sire , " I whispered , very low . " I do not think that I can bear it . . . . " He drew me to him , his arm about my shoulders ; it was a rare gesture he was not an affectionate man . " Poor little boy , " he  | said . " Poor Harry . . . Take heart . . . your father will come back to you . . . . " I sobbed . " But , sire all those years  --  I will not know him .... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my eyes . " You will be twenty-one , Harry . . . and you think the world has ended for you . Look at me , his father . . : I am fifty-eight , Harry , and have lived hard and fought hard all my days . . . Do you think I will live to see my son come back to me ? " I looked at him then and stopped my crying , reading in his face the full import of those long ten years . I laid my cheek against his , awkwardly . As I turned away , I saw two thin tracks , pearly , like snail traces , marking his face .  | I had thought to spend all my hours with Father in the little time that was left , but in truth I saw him only once again , the day of his leavetaking . He had scant days to set all his vast estates in order , barely a month , and his holdings were scattered over all England so that he traveled the whole time , picking stewards he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or calling upon kinsmen to aid him in his trouble . I know he gave much thought of where to put us , his children , into whose keeping to give us , and a score of lesser things . I knew this , but in my heart I felt that , had it been I , I would have found means to spend this last little space with those I loved . But let it go ; we are different men . My Grandfather Gaunt , after that day when he spoke to me his heart , on the clay of my father 's hard punishment , seemed to grow closer to me and wished me by him at all times . Father planned to send us three oldest myself , Tom , and John  --  to Fleshy , to our Grandmother Joan ; it was the greatest stronghold in the realm , or nearly , so he had reason , for all men have enemies . Grandfather , though , asked to have me in his keeping , swearing to protect my person and my inheritance with his life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sisters , Philippa and Blanche , were sent to Sir Hugh Waterton and his lady at a place called Eton " I'regos ; Sir Hugh was an old and trusted comradeat-arms and was in my father 's debt besides , so he felt they could be safe there . Kenilworth he would close except for its fortress , keeping men there to safeguard it . We all were busy , in that household , packing our personal things , deciding what favorite game or toy or even garment to take and which to leave behind , for it was impossible to move everything . My mother 's books I took with me , for they were precious , not just as relics , but worth a king 's ransom , too , Grandfather said , for their age and perfect workmanship ; we needed two Sumpter mules for them alone . At the last minute I took my  | play warriors , given to me that Christmas long ago at Monmouth , hiding them in my clothing chest under my smallclothes ; Tom would have laughed , I know , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most , and all his toys were broken and useless after a little . I myself , from earliest childhood , have set great store on beautiful things or things that were wrought with care and love ; I even took with me a belt , too small already , that my sister Blanche had stitched for my last birthday ; the threads had been picked out many times and done over , for she was only six then . But who knew when I would see her again ; it might be years . The Lady Kat called me her little peddler , but lovingly , and only in my ear ; I could see she understood . The fact was , when my grandfather saw our train , as we set out for his castle of Leicester , his eyebrows went high and his lips twitched in the wintry smile ; it was as though we traveled with forty kings across the world . He said nothing though ; he knew that I got it from him . All his manors were filled with treasures to the bursting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being no place to display them . I looked my last on Kenilworth , not thinking to feel sadness , for I had not been happy there , as at Monmouth ; as we rode out though , I did feel an ache , somewhere inside . So must a young tree feel when it is transplanted ; I have had many such uprootings , and I have felt them all , in one degree or another . In the last days of the month  --  it was October  --  my father rode to Eton Tregos , and then to Pleshy , to make his farewells to all his scattered children , coming on the very last day of all to me , where I stayed with Grandfather at Leicester Castle . It was a raw day , for the month was nearing its end ; all the leaves had fallen already , and the land looked bleak and colorless , waiting for winter ; it was winter in my heart , too , and my grandfather called me to him as we heard my father ride in . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father has enough to bear . I know you strong beneath , with a will and a soul like steel , but your father 's thoughts never run deep , and tears to him are womanish and not fit for his oldest son and heir . You must show him a strong outside , so he can take faith in you along with him in his exile . . . . " He held me in his arms for a moment , whispering . " We two know him well  --  this son of mine . . . he is brave as a lion , but a simple it  | man . Try to be as he wishes to see you . . . . " God help me , I understood his words that day , and beneath them , too . I saw my father clear that day ; it was perhaps the only time . He came in , my father , walking heavily in his mail , for he rode with only a few attendants . His face was whiter than I had seen it before , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on it ; I had not noticed before that there was gray in his ruddy beard . He spoke with me about the care of my horse and the feeding of my hawks , talking at length about saddles and the proper tightening of the girths , and such small things I knew already , until , it seemed , he ran down , and sat looking at me , pulling at his knuckles till they cracked . The Lady Kat ran in then , weeping , and threw herself at his feet . He patted her head awkwardly , where it lay in his lap , his face softening like a child 's . I had not thought him to be fond of her , but then I remembered . He had been raised motherless , too , like me , and the Lady Kat had been his governess when he was little . I felt my throat working and turned away , feeling in my pocket-pouch for my gift of parting . It was a St. Anthony 's medal , a charm against travel . He took it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I3y Christ 's nails , " he cried , " I 'll need it , boy ! " It was his favorite oath . He stood up , then , looking almost happy to be gone . He put his hands on my shoulders ; I saw he had to reach above his chest to do it , for I had grown fast that summer . " Well , Hal , " he said ; it was the women 's name for me , and I never remember him using it before . " Hal , be strong . . . the hopes of Lancaster rest on you now . . . do n't forget your father . . . . " I hit my lip hard , for my mouth was working in grief . " No , Father , never . Never will I forget you . " He did not embrace me even then , but he gave my shoulders , where he held them , a hard squeeze that took my breath , and turned to go . I tumbled for a word , shifting where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " maybe the king will let me come to you . . . in a year or two , when I am bigger . ... maybe he 'll let me come to you  --  in France or wherever you are . . . . " " The king ? " he said , low in his throat , a strangled sound . I looked and saw his face , alive with hate . My grandfather put out his hand . " Henry , " he said , " I would not have you go from these shores in anger . . . . "  | " By God , " cried my father . " Am I a saint ? What do you ask of me . . . to love Richard for this ? " Gaunt said , " Remember that our land is full of rebellion and unrest hate between you and Richard can be England 's death . . . . " " God must help England then , " said my father . " I think that no man was ever used so treacherously as my cousin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all . . . . " His face cleared , and he knelt before his father . " Your blessing , sire . . . . " My grandfather raised him to his feet . " My love goes with you , Harry , and my faith . . . I have Richard 's promise , " he said . " If I die before you return , your inheritance will be safe . . . . " " You 'll have many years yet , Father , " said the son , in that hearty way men speak when they speak of such things . " God keep you all , " he said . " And now I must go or I will miss ship . . . . " We watched him ride across the drawbridge and onto the London road , and watched till there was no longer a speck on the horizon to show . When we went back through the castle door , the halls seemed to echo with our footfalls , and the rooms seemed empty all that day , though there were servants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I never wept for my father then , though now he was gone , I could have ; it was a thing too grim for tears , or perhaps my manhood showed early , just for that day .  | That February my grandfather lay dying . He knew no one , not even the Lady Kat , his dearest love . He lay as in a swoon ; the doctors could not rouse him  --  even their lancets he did not seem to feel . King Richard had sent his physician , too , as soon as the news had reached him ; this John of Gaunt had always been his favorite uncle . But it seemed he was beyond the arts of men . We all had seen him stricken , it seemed by the hand of God . It had been his habit , before retiring , to play , in the long winter evenings , a game of chess with me ; he had spent much time teaching me the game , those months after my father rode to his banishment . We were all gathered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at each end of it , and only the very center was cold . Our r bedchambers were like the tomb , for it was a bitter winter , and we delayed our bed-going longer and longer , drinking sweet wine from Lorraine that was warmed by the fire . Lady Kat had set up a large loom against one wall and worked there with Joan Waring . This Joan was no longer needed as a nurse for me , I was rising eleven and not anxious to be seen by women in my smallclothes , but she was a clever young woman who could turn her hand to many things , and the Lady Kat valued her and kept her on . Grandfather and I sat close to the hearth , at a little table , one of his treasures , a pretty thing from the Eastern lands , all inlaid with ivory and gold , with the squares all marked in gems . He had just won the game , as usual , and was reaching down to the wine flagon at his feet , for he was always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheeks were flushed front the fire and the sweat trickled down my side beneath my clothes . I heard a sound , like a groan cut off short , and looked at him . He was frozen there , his hand stretched down to the hearth , and tipped sidewise in his chair , like a chess-piece that has not been set down properly . His face looked surprised ; his eyes stared . Slowly , slowly , while I watched in my own frozen horror , he toppled off the chair , his head falling right into the ashes . I jumped up then , calling out for help , and tried to drag him free  | from the hearth . A servant ran in , and another , to help me , and between us we moved him to a cleared place on the floor . Lady Kat knelt beside him , cradling his head , and Joan Waring ran for his valet , William Malbon , a man grown gray in his service . Malbon came , hurrying on his old , stiff legs , his face twisted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking charge , like a man half his age , calling for a litter and furs to wrap him about . Even so , it took all of us to straighten his limbs in seemly fashion ; they were like logs . We could not close his staring eyes ; they stayed that way , turned up to the ceiling , all the while we shifted him onto the litter and piled him with rugs of fur . His white hair was charred on top where the little flames had licked it before we could drag him away . The Lady Kat walked beside the litter , wringing her hands and moaning , like a small animal caught in a trap in the woods , Joan Waring beside her , bearing her up and making soothing sounds . He lay this way , like stone , for eight days ; my half-uncles were sent for , but he never knew them , though they kept vigil night after night beside his bed . He never knew me either , or his beloved wife , though toward the end his eyes lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only parts of him that moved , until the last . It was twilight , on the eighth day ; supper had been brought to hall , but we all lingered by his bed , his three bastard sons , his mistress-wife , and I , his first grandson . I saw the fingers of his right hand move and clutch my Lady Kat 's arm ; she made a sign to Joan Waring , who ran for the bowl and wafer , ready for days . There was no need to call a priest , for Gaunt 's middle son , my tutor , and another Henry , like father and me , had just been ordained . He made the sign of the cross above his father , wet his lips with wine , and touched the wafer to them , murmuring low in Latin . As though he heeded the words , my grandfather 's eyes grew keen again with the light of reason ; he moved his head a little on the pillow . Lady Kat took his feebly working fingers , and his eyes rested on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a ghost-thing , but plain to see . His mouth worked , and we leaned close to hear . I thought he said " Henry " twice , but could not be sure ; it was scarcely a whisper . Then , clearly , he said the word " England . . . " closed the eyes , so long wide , and we knew him dead . I heard a sob and , surprised , knew it for my own . As I looked , two thin trickles of blood ran from his nose . The Lady ih  | Kat wiped them away with her hanging sleeve and bent and kissed him tenderly on the lips . When she straightened up , and I saw his face , I thought he looked young , as I had never seen him , his skin waxen-pale , and all the deep lines wiped out . He had turned a yellow color by morning , but till they sealed him in his tomb he wore that look of youth ; I saw how men had called him once the most beautiful noble in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the Lady Kat said he had wanted it , though all his days had been spent in pomp and splendor ; the ground was frozen hard , and the horses ' hooves rang sharply against it as we bore the catafalque to the great vault . My uncles had ordered a larger-than-life effigy ; it was nearly finished . One of the finest stoneworkers in the world had been commissioned for it a Fleming ; I have forgotten his name . It was clear he knew his business , though ; even in its first rough state , one could see the look of my Grandfather Gaunt . The man must have known him in his prime . The Lady Kat changed after his death ; she still had a look of beauty , but the color had gone out of it . In her mourning black , she looked bluish-white , like milk when the cream is skimmed off the top ; there were two broad white wings in her red hair , at the temples . I spoke of it , for it was not unattractive , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a chore , now that he was gone . I had never known that she used any arts to keep her looks ; I was still a boy and very green . Also , I think she suffered from what our old monk poets called " accidie , " a kind of sickness of the soul , where nothing has meaning , and one day goes by like another , in an endless string . She called me to her one day , just two weeks after we had laid my grandfather in his tomb , and said she wished to retire to a convent in the spring . Joan Waring would go with her , for they had grown very close , for servant and mistress , and there they would live out their clays . I wept , for I was never shamed before that sweet lady , and she took my head between her hands , raising it to look into my eyes , and saying , " Oh , Hal , it will be better so , fin- you also . . . a boy can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you to Plcshy , to be with your brothers . Your lady grandmother- already she has asked for you . " I smiled , even through my tears , and said , " Granny Gallowspost ? I had rather go to jail . . . . "  | " Oh , Hal , you are unkind . . . . " But the Lady Katharine 's lip twitched , for all her words ; she had never heard the nickname before . I did not doubt she understood its meaning well either , for often and often I had heard my Grandmother Joan rail at her for some fault as if she were a child or stare her through when her finery seemed too bold . Still , though I did not relish my gran 's harsh rule , I began to think of Tom and John , too , and all the boy 's ways we would share there at Pleshy . It was surrounded by dense forest , almost untouched , and the hunting would be fine ; a river ran beside the land , too , full of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not seen my brothers for near five months . They neither of them had come for Grandfather 's funeral , being just over the measles , and still weak . So , all in all , I looked forward to the move . Lady Kat was busy for days , snipping off the jewels from her gowns and robes and unwinding the gold braid trimmings . All these she would take to the convent with her , for it was the poor one she had lived in as a girl , and would welcome all that could be converted into monies , having gone without so long . The fur she left on everything , for , as she said , the poor would need its warmth ; I thought of our village women , with their broad , flat faces and matted hair , their lice and their filth that they wore from one year to the next , and smiled to think of them going about in her beautiful gauds . Everything was going to our poor , except for her black garments , which she would wear to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gown , in case she should be summoned from retirement by the king . Though her hair seemed to me even whiter , and growing more so each day , she hummed as she worked , and some of her color had crept back into her cheeks , but delicately , like the last blush on a rose before the petals fall . I think she looked forward to her convent , though she had never shown much taste for religion ; perhaps she thought to see some of those others she had known there long ago . I asked her once , and she answered yes , many of the novices had rernained on as nuns and could not be so very old , just her own age . Though , of course , she added with a hint of her old self , smiling , her age was greater than I knew . She looked a girl again as she said it , though I never saw that look upon her again . Her finest jewels she kept for us children and her own sons ; Blanche , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got the great betrothal  | sapphire of Lancaster , one of the most perfect in the whole realm , and in the world , as far as I might know . She gave me a small ring , too , and her harp ; it had been a gift from her Master of Gaunt long ago , when she had been governess to his children , and he had first seen her and loved her . It was a beautiful thing , very old , of Italian work , and much worn , for she had practiced faithfully , though never had she learned to play very well . " Perhaps you will have better luck , Hal , with it . . . the strings always cut my fingers , I never got the knack . " It was a heavy thing , and big , so I could not take it then ; years later , after her death , I sent for it ; the strings which had hurt her hands were all rotted by then and had to be replaced . I thought of her mortality then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these days of my childhood , her goodness , and my boy 's love for her , and I wept as I handled it . It will seem I weep often , for a man-creature , but it is in secret always , and no eyes see my weakness . It was the day before I was to ride to Pleshy ; four men-at-arms were to ride with me and stay there , too , part of the household , and all my gear was packed and ready to be loaded on the mules . I went outside the castle , for it was one of those fine days you get sometimes in March , without a wind , and with a hint of the spring to come in the air . I walked through the gardens and saw that the first crocuses were out , though a thin frost still lay like a glaze over the ground . The walls of stone enclosed the garden like a monastery wall , but above the stone was a kind of gallery fashioned of wood , going right around . Set in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in gold and silver the emblazoned arms of the Plantagenets , of Lancaster , of Derby , and of Chestcr . I had been deep in thought , saying my inward farewells to this place , as I had to two other homes before , when I heard a splintering noise above my head . I looked up and saw soldiers , in chain mail , hacking at the blazoned work . I did not recognize any of their faces ; they were none of ours , I was sure , and I called out to them , angry . " What are you doing ' " I cried . " Come down from there , before I call the steward and his bailiffs ! " One of them , just above me , got the tip of his lance under a blazon and wrenched outward , levering it from the wood with a loud , sickening crack . Ile stood on a ladder and dropped the blazon to the ground . I saw red and ran over and pulled the ladder from under his feet , so that he fell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He clambered to his feet ; he was not hurt , but very angry , and reached for his dagger . " Let be , " called another . " It is Derby 's whelp ! " This man climbed down from the wall and stood looking at me . " What are you doing ? " I cried , still wild . " Those are my father 's arms ! " Then my head cleared a little , and I saw his badge of the White Hart on the mail over his breast , Richard 's insignia . I must have turned pale then or showed something of what I felt , for his face softened a little , and he said , in a rough sort of kindness , " Best go in to your lady grandmother , hinny . " He spoke in a northern speech-sound ; I could hardly follow it and stared at him still . Joan Waring came out then , her face all red and the cords standing out in her neck . She took me about the shoulders and shouted at the soldiers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tongue , which for sure has a barbarous pitch to ears that have not heard it before . She stormed at them a while until she saw one of them make an obscene gesture , known even to me , then she spat at them , calling them , in English , pigs and whoresons , and their king , too . It was treason she was uttering , but in truth she was so pretty in her fury that they liked her for it , and I heard one of them say , " What a wife on a cold night , " and shake his fingers as if they burned , a gaptoothed grin splitting his face . She bent to me . " You are to go inside now , Lord Hal , to the lady . . . . " I saw that under her wild words , her eyes swam bright with tears . I had heard nothing , where I had walked in the walled garden ; I had heard no horses , or the gate creaking open , but there were strangers in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had not seen before . My grandfather 's steward , a man named Walter Hungerford , who had served him for many years , sat at a trestle table which had been set up at one end of the room . His rent books were in front of him , I recognized them from our arms and their size ; I had seen them often , even sometimes practicing my sums with them . He hunched over them with a quill and inkstand , marking figures on each sheet . One of the strange men stood behind him , scanning each page as it was turned . He was splendidly garbed in the king 's colors , his sleeves lined with fur , and a large blue jewel gleamed in one earlobe ; I gawked , for I had not before seen such a fashion on a man . He must have felt  | my eyes , for he turned and looked me up and down ; I felt , obscurely , that now I knew what Joan Waring meant when she complained to the lady of some rude man-at-arms that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this man 's eyes held a strange interest , with contempt under , and dwelt upon my hosed legs , where they met my short surcoat . His face gave me the creeps , though it had a pinched sort of comeliness ; he toyed all the while with a little jeweled dagger . His eyes slid from me , and he pressed the dagger point into Hungerford 's back , lightly , between the shoulder blades . " Get on with it , man ! " I burst out to my lady , who stood helpless , clasping and unclasping her hands , " They are pulling down my father 's livery from the walls ! " A little spasm went over her face , but she spoke calmly . " They are following the king 's orders , " she said . " The king is taking your father 's holdings in forfeit . All that he thought to inherit ? " And her voice broke , like a lute string that has snapped . " But my father can not live ? " I cried . " How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Oh , Hal , " she said , very low , " your father will not come back . . . " I stared at her . " He 'll not come back again . . . the king has banished him for life . " At this I broke . I had thought myself wild-angry , but now I knew ; this must be the blackest day of my life . I burst into a storm of weeping . I heard the peacock stranger snort in disgust , and my lady clutched me hard and knelt beside me , but I could not stop . Joan Waring ran in , too , and spoke soft words in Welsh to soothe me . It seems I was out of my wits . Then he of the earring walked over to me , cold-eyed , and slapped me smartly across the face . It was like a bucket of icy water ; I froze . With all my beatings I had never been hit in the face . The Lady Kat stood up , smoothing her gown ; I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are you , sirrah , " she said in a voice like drops of poison , " that you dare touch a Lancaster ? " I lc bowed and smiled thinly . " Sir William Bagot , at your service , Lady . " She almost gasped , though she made no sound . All the world , even I , knew him for Richard 's minion . I felt myself blush , for these things were new to me still , and I felt shame at my knowledge before the women . " 1 only tapped him lightly , " he said . " It is the best way to deal  | with hysterics . . . Would you have him rolling on the floor in a fit ? Besides , " he said , drawling the words , " he is no longer a Lancaster , as you know . He is nothing , now , but the king 's creature . His father Derby has seen to that . " He turned away , as if bored , back to the rent-book business , and Lady Kat drew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the carved bench where my grandfather was stricken weeks ago . " Hal , " she said , and there was no more a tremor in her face , " Hal , my poor Hal there 's no cause for such tears . Listen ? Richard has always held me in his favor . . . when you are fifteen , we 'll go to him I 'll go down on my knees to him , he 'll not refuse me , for my dead lord 's sake we 'll go down on our knees and beg him . . . beg leave for you to go to your father in France or wherever he is . . . you and he can travel Europe together . . . go on crusade , maybe . . . see Jerusalem and the holy places . . . sail together in the great fast ships from Genoa . It will be so  --  I promise you . . . . " " He 'll want Tom with him , too , " I said , choking . " And John . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . " " All  --  all of you shall go  --  I 'll beg the king 's mercy . . . I promise , my sweet Hal . . . you 'll see . The king is good , I knew him as a boy . . . . " I burst out again . " How can he be good when he uses my father so ? How can he make my father wander about the world , away from home , until he dies . . . Oh , Lady , " I said , low , " the king will break my father 's heart . " Behind me I heard Bagot make an impatient sound and close the rent-book with a snap . " My Lady , " he said , " we have not all the time in the world . Will you prepare the boy and let us get to our journey ? " My eyes must have grown round as marbles this one day , for again I stared . The Lady Kat sat silent a moment , then spoke , slowly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are to go to him in London . " I felt an unknown dread , and she must have read it on my face , for she said gently , " Oh , Hal , there is nothing to fear . You are to be under Richard 's care and protection , that is all . You are his little cousin , and he wants to know you . " She spoke for my ears alone , saying , " Oh , Hal , do you think the king would send his own great friend to fetch you if he meant you any harm ? "  | I was still in panic , and I cried , beside myself , " No  --  no  --  I wo n't go ! " " Oh , by the cross , " said Bagot , annoyed . " I am here to carry out the king 's commands , not to argue with little boys . Prepare him , my Lady , and quickly . He is permitted one servant , and baggage that will be contained on one mule . Make haste ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is a masque tomorrow night in which Richard himself appears . . . if I miss it he will have my head . " I looked up , fearing , and saw that he jested . He smiled again his thin-lipped smile , and I saw it , in a sort , a look of kindness , or pity , perhaps . I rose , mastering my voice . " Sir , have I time to change ? I would not go to the king in my oldest clothes . " I saw this pleased him , but he only said , " Be quick , then . " As I left the hall , I heard the Lady Kat ordering wine and cold meats and ale for the soldiers ; I heard her , also , call for old William Malbon , my grandfather 's faithful valet , to go with me and be my man-servant . Joan Waring followed me out , sobbing loud . For this last time , I suffered her to help me dress , for my fingers trembled on the points , and besides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this world .  | We came to London in good time , by late afternoon the next day . I saw it in wonder , for it stretched clear to Tyburn , and we rode past field after field , with cottages close to the road , as I had never seen them , miles before we had come to the gates of the city itself . I had made friends with one of the soldiers , he who had spoken to me in the garden and laughed at Joan 's Welsh . The first night , when I was ready to drop from weariness , before we came to an inn , he had taken me up before him on his own horse , leading mine , and I had fallen asleep against his sweaty shirt ; under the sweat was a smell of hay and horse , and as I nodded off , it seemed I was again in the arms of White Will , who had held me close on my mother 's death-day , long ago . This soldier  --  he was an archer  --  spoke , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had grown used to his brogue now and understood his words ; he was from Northumberland , where the Percys ruled , richer than kings . He said , " Look you , lad . . . yonder the road that leads to Westminster where all the kings are crowned . " " But I thought King Richard lived there , " I said . " Sometimes , " he answered , " but he has many castles , as many as we have fingers between us , and more . Just now , he is lodging in the Tower . " We came to a broad street which he said was called The Strand , and there the city itself began . I had never seen its like . It was noisy and crowded , smelly with a thousand things I could riot identify , its streets filled with booths , gaily colored , full of wonderful things to eat or wear . Everywhere there were swinging signs , spelling out the shops and even the houses where folk had their various trades . There were signs for all these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them yet ; they were like letters of Greek to me . Apprentices bawled out the wares of their masters ' shops , standing in the doorways , and holding out marvelous things combs with jewels set in ( after , I learned they were made of glass ) ; great silver loving cups , fake , too , I learned ,  | but finely glittering ; rolls of silks and brocades ; jars of cinnamon and other spices I did not know . Over all was a heavenly smell of new-baked bread . My new friend , the archer Wat was his name , like the dead rebel leaned down to a bake-wife and tossed her a coin . She held up to us two pale-brown loaves , still steaming from the oven ; she was fat and wore a red petticoat above bare feet . He pinched her cheek and took the loaves . " Who is the pretty lad ? " she shouted . " Not yours , I 'll be bound , you toothless wonder ! " He laughed in high good humor and shook his head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own nephew , come to see the sights . . . " " Go on , " she said , unbelieving . We rode on . The bread was wonderful , crisp and chewy , hot almost to burn our hands . I had heard my grandfather say often that poverty lay upon our land like a filthy cloak , but here it was masked , certainly ; everyone seemed to buy , and money flowed from hand to hand . The streets throbbed with all sorts of people  --  great ladies , even , though Wat said they were just expensive whores ; my eyes popped at one , a beauty , not much older than I myself , but dressed all in silver and gold , a ring on every finger . She wore no head-coif , and her black hair hung down her back , curled into a thousand ringlets . She would not smile for us ; I was a boy and my companion-at-horse a common soldier , but she curtsied low to Sir William , who rode behind . " Little good you 'll get from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as we passed . There were cassocked friars , too , their tonsured head showing sunburn , and black-gowned clerks and hooded scriveners ; aldermen in their scarlet , and guild-men in their guild-livery . Wat knew them all ; he had been two years in London . To me , the city was like a great fair ; I fell in love with it then , and I have never fallen out . By the time we came to the Tower , it was twilight , and they were lighting the torches . At this time of year , night falls fast , and so I saw little as I was led through the winding halls and up dim stairs to the White Tower bedchamber where I would be lodged . William Malbon was with me ; I looked at his face in the rushlight and saw him weary to the bone . He was an old man , of course , and not used to long rides on horseback . We stood in the bedchamber where they had brought us ; our guide had dumped my gear in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and  | with many intricate designs in red hues . The wall hangings were rich , too , and new , and the room was very large . " Am I to go to bed now , " I said , " without seeing the king ? I thought he would greet me ; we are cousins . " Someone laughed from a doorway ; I caught a whiff of the closestool before the door was shut . " There are so many cousins here . . . . " And he laughed again . It was a boy , about my size , but very fair and flaxen ; even his eyebrows and his lashes were blond . He had a pale and sickly look , but haughty , too . He frowned a little , looking at me . " I know you , " he said , and snapped his fingers , thinking . I saw his serving man , in a dim corner , emptying a bowl of water into a large ewer . The man was poorly clad , his livery patched at knees and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or bedgown , the fur moth-eaten , and the velvet rubbed away in spots . There was something sad and faded about them both , and my skin crawled a little with a wordless fear . The boy said , snapping his fingers again , " I forget the name " His man answered , " It is Lord Henry of Lancaster , " he said . " He will share your bed at present , being under the king 's protection , like yourself . " The boy laughed again ; I wondered if he was an idiot . " I am a cousin , too  --  yours also . I am Duke Humphrey of Gloucester . . . do you have to use the closestool ? " He was no idiot ; he had seen me as I stood , moving from one foot to another , to hold my water in . I nodded . He pointed to the door he had come out from . " It stinks in there ; there is no window . . . you can leave the door open if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will hold my ears . . . . " When I came back , he was in the great bed , with the coverlet pulled up to his chin . As Malbon helped me to undress , the boy said , suddenly , " You have beautiful clothes . . . so new . . . . " It had a wistful sound . " I do not much care for such things , " I said . " But I have many more there was not room to bring them . " " Be sure you will never see them again , " he said . " They have stolen all of mine . . . " Who ? " I asked , startled . " Oh , some of the others , " said the boy , airily . I thought about this , getting into my nightshirt in silence and creeping into the bed beside him . He moved over , but taking most of the coverings with him ; Malbon put my fur bedgown over me , tucking it all  | around . Humphrey waved his hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to blow out the candles and leave us . Malbon , too , went with him , bidding me sleep well . " Where will they sleep ? " I whispered . " Oh , outside , somewhere . I think there is a dressing room . . . " All our folk had been taught to take care of our servants ' welfare ; I could not think how he had been brought up , this Duke Humphrey , and resolved to find out how Malbon was faring as soon as morning came . I spoke again , softly ; the strange room , darkened now , with only the firelight flickering on the shadows , made me feel wary . " I had thought , " I said , " to see the king . . . do we always go to bed so early here ? I have been used to sit up a little . . . . " His voice grew sly , somehow . " Oh , that 's because there is a masque tonight . They never let us stay on a masque night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . " " 1 ) o they have whores there ? " I asked , eager to show off my little knowledge . He laughed again . " Of a sort , " he said . He was silent for a little , and we watched the glow of the fire on the stone-arched windows , and the ironwork sconces black against them . Then he said , in a sad little voice , " You are pretty , Lord Henry . Richard will like you for it . . . He said once that I looked like a rabbit . . . . " I remembered his two big teeth at the front and pushed the thought away for its unkindness . " You arc golden-fair , " I said . " Like the king 's own self . . . . Maybe , " I said , feeling very bold , " maybe the king is jealous . . . . " Oh , no , " said Humphrey . " We are all of us here Plantagenet , all fair he is used to that . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lie had gone to sleep . But he asked suddenly , " How old are you , 1 leery " ? " I answered that I was eleven . " You are too big for eleven , " he said in a smug sort of way . " I am fourteen . " " I expect it has to do with my forebears , " I said . " My grandfather was passing tall . . . my mother , too , for a woman . . . . " " Is your mother dead then ? " he asked . " Yes . " " Mine , too , " he said . " She died eighteen months ago  --  and so  | you are Derby 's son , " he said . " And a pauper , too , since Richard has taken all your inheritance and banished him forever . " " How do you know this ? " I was astonished . " I only knew it yesterday , myself ! " " The court is all gossip , " he said . " Everybody knows everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are things that are only whispered . . . things about Richard . . . . " He lowered his voice even more . " I hate him , " he said , hissing into my ear . " He murdered my father . " " Murdered him ? " I repeated , stupidly , my hair crawling on my scalp . " Sh-h-h , " he said , putting his hand over my mouth . " Listen , " he whispered . " It was in Calais Castle . Mowbray 's men did it . " " Mowbray  --  but my father " " Yes your father he knew about it , found out somehow . He was there at Calais . . . " He was still for a moment ; I thought I heard him sob under his breath . " Get all the way under the covers , " he said , " and I 'll tell you . . . . " We pulled them over our heads and lifted our knees to make a sort of tent ; I remembered that Tom and I used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our boys ' secrets , when we were supposed to be asleep . But this was headier stuff . The boy went on , whispering low ; his breath smelled of mint he must have been chewing it earlier , to clean his teeth . " The king always hated my father ; he put him under arrest as one of the lords appellant and locked him up in Calais , in the donjon there . Mowbray was in charge of Calais garrison . Richard told him to see that my father never came out . " He drew a long shuddering breath . " Mowbray 's men held a feather pillow to my father 's face so that he could not cry out for help . And that was how he died , strangling , with Mowbray watching till it was done . It would take a long time , " he said , his voice shaking . " I tried it myself one time with a pillow . . . I would rather have the ax . . . . " I could not take it in . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be . . . . " " Oh , do n't be a fool-baby , " he hissed , angry . " What do you think your father accused Mowbray of on Brentford Bridge ? What do you think he said to the king ? " I was silent , my thoughts running around in circles . " No one dares to say it , but everyone guesses . Why was your  | father sent away ? Because Mowbray was the king 's man , and when he named Mowbray a murderer he named the king , too . " " But , " I said , my mind fumbling for reason , " your father was the king 's uncle , like my Grandfather Gaunt . The king would not murder his own uncle . " " Why not ? " said Humphrey . " He 'd murder anybody to keep his throne . All kings would . My mother said it . She said all kings wade knee-deep in blood . " I felt stifled myself suddenly and threw down the coverlet from my face . I still could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different from all I had read of kings and great people in high places . But was it yet ? I remembered Arthur 's story , all romancehung , but with Mordred in it , too , who betrayed his own father and plotted his death . And the Danish king , long ago , who killed his brother to lie with his brother 's wife . Under the rippling notes and beauteous words of the songs were the terror and the blood , the avarice and the shame . " Have some mint leaves , " said Humphrey suddenly . " They 're dried , but if you chew them a while they get soft . I stole them from Richard 's own pouch , " he added proudly . I took what he offered ; its sharp and pungent taste spread through my mouth . I remembered where I had thought to be tonight at Pleshy , with my brothers , and my grandmother , who , though harsh , had surely made no one die of it . And I thought of the Lady Kat , whom I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sound , though I tried not to , for my cousin Humphrey said , " You can lean on my shoulder if you want to cry . Myself , I never do it anymore , though I used to , at first . " I did not move or speak . " Oh , well , never mind I expect you 'll do it anyway , after I 'm asleep . . . . But you 'll soon get used to it here ; they have a lot of banquets , and hunting , too , sometimes . . . . I would n't mind , except for all the tutors . . . and then Richard never gives me any pocket money . . . .  | I did not see the king next day . Humphrey said , with that laugh that seemed a part of him , that Richard slept the full clock round after a masque . I could not help liking Humphrey , though many of the tales he told I thought he made up in his own head ; he was old-seeming , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half inch the taller . He knew no games or knightly exercises and could barely sit a horse ; likewise , he was lazy at his studies and had , indeed , no accomplishments that I could see . But he knew all the gossip of Richard and his court ; when he pointed out this one or that at table that first day , I grew uncomfortable , thinking of whose bed each was in or out of , according to his whispers . By the next day , though , we had grown to be good friends , for we were the youngest boys there . I had more suits than I needed , and he had only one out-of-fashion wine-colored outfit , much worn and beginning to smell moldy ; I bade him take one of mine , in yellow velvet , which I did not much like . He could not credit his ears and cried , " But it is like new ! I can not take your best ! " I answered that it had a wine stain on it , near the waist , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was full of delight and put it on right away ; when he had buckled his wide leather belt , only a tiny speck of the stain showed . He strutted like a peacock , and , truth to tell , it transformed him , for the color brought a glow of gold to his fairness , and the hose , which were striped around with orange , showed off his straight , slender legs . " You must have something in return , " he cried , and rummaged in his trinket chest . " Here , " he said , " have this . " It was a little knife for meat , ivory-handled , with a real blade made of steel . I had never yet had one , only a bone blade that was never sharp enough , so I was much pleased , and we were quits . So we strolled out , arm in arm , to explore the Tower , he bright as a butterfly in his saffron , and I with the little meat-dagger fastened conspicuously to my belt . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you like , " he said in a bored way . 6o Fortune Made His Sword  | " Lions ! " I cried . " There are lions here  --  in the castle ? " " In the Lion Tower . They 're nothing much to look at  --  their fur is mangy and they only walk around , and throw up , sometimes . " " Throw up ? " I said . " The damsels feed them sweetmeats , though they have been bidden not to . Girls are stupid . Lions should have meat only . " What damsels ? I thought , for I had seen none , only great ladies , all old , to my eyes . And then I remembered Richard 's new queen , who would , of course , have ladies about her . This marriage of the king 's , four years ago , after Queen Anne died , had been a little scandal in the realm ; even the serving folk talked shame of it . For Richard had married a six-year-old princess of France ; it would be many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he had no children either from Queen Anne . Richard was young yet , of course , but kings are expected to breed heirs or their subjects talk . Duke Humphrey knew his way about the place well and was friends with all the guards , so we passed into the Lion Tower without any questions , though there were soldiers all about ; at one corner a little knot of them threw dice and did not even look up as we went by . There were stairs inside , leading up to a kind of narrow gallery or platform that ran all around . Below was a pit , where the lions lived . There were only two , and they were asleep ; only kind of tawny-gray humps showed in the straw , and I was disappointed . We made noises to attract their attention , whistling and banging on the railing , but they never roused . There was a partition in the pit , though , with three other beasts , tawny-gold , too , and spotted all over with dark marks . They looked like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I Iunmphrey said they were the famous leopards sent by the emperor long ago to Henry II . I began to count in my head , looking my disbelief , and he said , " Not the same ones , silly . What do you take me lbr ? But  --  there are always leopards kept here since that time ; they symbolize the arms of England . " I watched them for a time ; they padded silently in the straw or lay down to scratch their fleas . One began to wash itself all over , like our tabby at home in Kenilworth , twisting its head right around to lick the back of its neck , and using its wetted paw to wipe its face . It was truly rather boring after a while , as Humphrey had said , and the  | smell was rank and caught in the nostrils , so we turned to go . " There is another one , " he said , " through here . " And he led me through a small door into a little chamber cut into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room , its bars as thick as a man 's arm , and padlocked . Behind it paced a beautiful creature , black as coal , another cat , but bigger , and heavier in the shoulders . It was a leopard , too , but rarer , Humphrey said , from Egypt ; the Baron of Glendourdy had brought it back for Richard . He was the most traveled man in the realm , Humphrey said , and Richard 's great good friend ; nothing nasty , he added , seeing a funny look in my eye . Only that Richard called him the most civilized man of the age and loved to converse with him , for Richard valued fine talk . It was the first I had heard of this great baron but not the last ; men mostly called him Owen Glendower in my time . He was a Welshman , and we nearly lost England to him ; but then I paid little heed to the name , watching the fabled beast in the cage . It never stopped but paced endlessly back and forth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and turn , and so on , its muscles rippling like waves under the silky black of its coat . Its face was pure savage and took my breath away ; under its shelf of brow , I saw , with a little shock , that its eyes were bright yellow , the iris pleated with amber . I had never seen anything so beautiful or so noble . I felt pity for it , too , in its raging , insistent walk ; it must have thought , poor marvelous thing , that it could walk the bars away . As we came down to the foot of the stairs , we heard a noise along the hall , like a hundred birds twittering , one voice above the rest , sharp and high , talking at great speed . A group of lords and ladies flowed out into the broad hall , like water when it spreads out from a stream ; the ladies wore tall headdresses and had no eyebrows they were plucked clean away  --  a new fashion ; and the men , richly dressed , laughed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , went a gorgeous young man , all in gold like a walking gem ; his ringed fingers were long and slender , his narrow hands waved about as he talked , never still . I had seen him only from far away , in the stands at my father 's trial , but it could be no one else ; this was Richard of Bordeaux . Humphrey had fallen to his knees , and I kneeled quickly , too , my new dagger , improperly fastened , making a clatter where it fell on the flags .  | Richard stopped ; I felt his stare and raised my eyes a little . The face I saw above me , under its gilt circlet , was surely the most beautiful in the world . It looked as though it were carved of some precious substance , not flesh ; I remembered that Humphrey had whispered that Richard wore some thin paste , made of an Eastern plant , to color it . He looked sun-kissed all over , indeed ; I saw that under the gold and jeweled trim , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Humphrey trembling . Richard reached out one long hand and raised me gently . " You are our cousin Lancaster , " he said . " I see your mother 's face , when first she came to court . . . Very lucky you are , my pretty boy , that you do not sport a carrot top ! " He looked about him , waiting , delicately . The men laughed , emptily , and a twitter rose from the ladies . I felt the hot blood rush to my cheeks and my hands make fists . His eyes were bright blue and very keen ; he smiled . " You have your father 's cock spirit , though , I see . . . . " Again the foolish laughter rose . He whirled suddenly , like one of his own big cats . " Let be ! " he said , and the words were like two drops of ice . " We are cousins , close , Red Derby and I . . . he is worth a thousand such as you . . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me while I struggled to master my feelings , so mixed as they were . Richard waved a languid hand , not even looking behind . " Leave us , " he said . Behind him the lords and ladies , silent as mice , backed away through the doorway ; the last two lords collided . We heard a tiny sound , cloth ripping ; a sword hilt must have caught somewhere . Richard laughed . It was the first I had seen of his swift changes ; a faint tremor washed over me I knew him dangerous . Humphrey had risen , too , and was edging toward the door . Richard whirled . " I have not given you leave , " he said . " Stay , little yellow bird . . . . " 1 luniphrey fell again to his knees ; they cracked , sharply , and I winced . " You think me cruel , cousin ? " asked Richard , looking at inc . " No , sire , " I said , lowering my eyes . " You have such long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faintly . I could not think where to look . " Come , " he said , his long fingers cupping my chin . " Let us have the kiss of peace . " And he stooped and kissed me , full on the lips . His mouth was as cool as  | marble . He turned again to Humphrey . " You may rise , sirrah . . . . " He looked him coolly up and down . " The effect is good , " he said . " Never had I thought to see you so near to handsome . . . but who gave you leave to ape your king ? " " Oh , sire , " I burst out , " it is my fault . . . I gave him the suit ! His own was falling into rags and smelled , too he had no other . . . and I have so many ! The color does not become me either . . . and he gave me this knife , too , in return . . . . " Richard still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I took my courage in my two hands , or in my mouth rather . It must be all or nothing , with this king , I thought . After all , he can not kill me for it . " Sire , " I said , " we could not know you chose to wear this color on this day be fair . You are the king . My grandfather told me , of all others , kings must be fair . It is their duty . " I saw the crimson mount from beneath his jeweled collar , up under the paint . His eyes were cold . I shook inside but gave him stare for stare , though I had to tilt my head back to do it . It was a long moment ; I do not think I drew breath . The color faded slowly from his face ; he shifted his weight to one hip , threw back his head , and laughed . His laughter was rich and deep , unlike his voice . " You are bold , fair cousin , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " And he made a fist , playfully striking me with it on the jaw , as my father had done once to Tom , while I watched . " Maybe I should have a list made , posting my attire for each week  --  would you have that ? It would give my stewards something to do . . . . " I laughed , too , then , seeing the joke . " You have a good eye , though , cousin Harry . . . you have made our Humphrey bloom . " He looked at Humphrey . " Which of us is the fairer in the color , do you think ? " " Oh , sire , " I said , earnestly , " I think there is no fairer man on this earth than you . . . except my Grandfather Gaunt , maybe , when he was young . . . . " He gave a little pleased smile but said mildly , putting his arm about my shoulders , " You know how to flatter , Harry . . . . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my words away . " Let be , sweet cousin . . . I know you honest . You please me well . . . But let us get to this problem of Humphrey . . . why has he no clothes ? " " Oh , sire , they have stolen them . . . "  | He frowned . " Who is they ' ? " Humphrey swallowed , audibly . " I do not know , sire . . . but they have been missing since I came here . . . . " " So long ? " said Richard . " Well , cousin , we shall see to it . . . you shall have others . I like pretty boys about me , not ragamuffins . . . you please me , too , today , Humphrey . Come  --  you , too , shall have the kiss of peace . " And he bent to him but kissed him on the forehead only . I spoke again , quickly , before he had lost this mood . " Also , sire , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have none either . . . except two nobles from the Lion-Heart 's time . . . I was saving them for their great age . . . . " " You shall both have monies , " he said . " Come follow me . . . be quick , I shall not always feel so generous . . . . " He led us , holding onto both our wrists , like leading little dogs , to a small chamber where a scribe sat ; he dictated to him low . When he had finished , he handed us each a paper . Mine set forth , that by the munificence of my lord , the king , Richard of Bordeaux , I would receive , while my father was in exile , the sum of five hundred pounds each year . I gasped . " Oh , sire , " I cried . " It is too much ! What shall I do with it ? " He looked amused . " You will have servants to tip and your man 's wages . . . besides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look of you . . . and then , there will be presents  --  for fair ladies , later . . . . " He looked sly . " I do not much care for girls , " I said , " except my sisters . " " Boys do not , " he said , laughing , " at your age . " But I saw my answer pleased him , and that also he enjoyed being generous . He turned to Humphrey . " And you , cousin , " he asked , " can you buy clothes to suit you now ? " I luniphrey 's eyes brimmed with tears ; he could not speak but grabbed the king 's hand and kissed it . Richard patted his shoulder . " Remind me , Humphrey I have some earrings that would suit you well . They are too small for me , but they are topaz . . . " I le took Humphrey 's earlobe , giving it a little pinch . " We will have to pierce these . . . . " " Oh  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not hurt . . . . " said Richard . " I would not hurt boys . . . . " " Sire , " I said , " may I send to Kenilworth for my play warri- ors ? It is not that I need toys , but I like to plan campaigns with them . . . and they are very fine-made , too . . . I had not time to bring them when I came . . . . " " Anything , " he said , with an airy wave of his hand . " I will lend you a man . . . But mind you keep all your boy-stuffs in your own chamber . . . I can not bear clutter . . . . " " Oh , sire thank you ! " " You may call me Cousin Richard , " he said , " when we are private . . . have you met my little queen , Harry ? She is most fair , with lashes longer than your own , and just your age . . . . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a little cross , " she is a full year younger ! " " Oh , " he said , laughing that rich laugh that differed so from all the rest of his person . " Oh , for sure a year is such a great time when you are young . . . . " He looked , on a sudden , tired , and in the light that slanted through the latticed window I saw , around his eyes , tiny fine lines against the smooth skin of his face . And , I remembered , he was thirty-two .  | I still did not see the little queen ; I learned she had the measles and was still in quarantine . I said to Richard that she could come out , as Humphrey and I had had the sickness already , along with our other cousins and most of the pages . They did not call themselves pages here , but squires , or gentlemen-at-livery , or some such fancy titles , but they were still green boys , like ours at home , not much older @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in that way of play that I rather liked , and saying , " But I have not had that same pox yet ; would you have your king laid low like a schoolboy ? Besides , " he said , " I thought you had no great liking for girls . . . . " " Well , but I have never yet seen a French person , " I answered . " And I can speak the tongue a little . " In truth I was curious ; a little jealous , too , for all our cousins spoke of this girl as though she were sent straight from heaven . " Well , " said Richard , " you will have your fill of them , Harry ? all her damsels are from the French court and chatter like magpies , but faster  --  except for one , that is Welsh  --  Owen 's byblow . . . . " " Owen ? " I asked . " The great Owen ap Griffith , of Glendower . . . he is in France now , my envoy no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I stared in shock , for Isabeau was the queen of all the French , and I had not thought Richard would say such a thing of royalty , being royal himself . " You know little , fair cousin , " said he , ruffling my hair . " I would not have you grow into a prig  --  you may as well know now she is the whore of the world . . . . I swallowed ; I had been brought up by women mostly , after all , who stopped their talk when I came in the door . " They say , though , that she is beautiful . . . Queen Isabeau . " I tried to speak as a roan who knew the world . " If you like them fat , " said Richard , making a face . " She rubbed against me all the while the bishop said my marriage lines . . . " He laughed . " He was half blind and thought she was  | the bride . . . I wish our Owen joy of her  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . " I stared again , and Richard threw back his golden head , roaring loud ; we were seated on a little bench alone , but the hall was filled with ladies , and I blushed like a flame . " Still , " he said , wiping away his tears of laughter on his sleeve-lace , " Owen will manage well . . . he knows all manner of magic , herbs and the like . . . and besides they say half Wales is his get . . . " " Do you think , Cousin Richard , " I said , whispering , " that the little queen knows . . . ? " " Isabelle ? " he said , raising his eyebrows high . " How can she not ? Isabeau had Orleans in her bedchamber where all the little girls slept too . Sure they could not have snored through it all ! " " Orleans the duke , " I thought . " Her own brother-in-law ! " I saw in truth that I had been brought up monkishly . But then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I still did not dare mention my father to the king , but in my heart I felt that Richard liked me , and someday might listen if I begged a favor of him . I crossed my fingers , wishing . There were not so many cousins about the court as Humphrey had said that first night ; only two , besides ourselves , that were true-born . There were plenty of bastards , but richly dressed and in no way slighted , and some girl-cousins too . Of the two trueborn boys , they were men really , I liked one on sight and did not like the other . Our cousin Edward of York reminded me a little of my uncle Thomas Beaufort ; he was fairer , sandy of hair and not red , but he had the same face in a way , full and fleshy , with an expression of good will and mildness , and besides he played sweetly on the lute and sang too . The other cousin , his brother , was Richard of Cambridge ; they were both sons of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a haughty creature , very vain , and dressed as richly as Bagot or the king . He had that fair look , too , which is always called Plantagenet , I discovered , as though no others had a right to it . ( Actually , most of the true English are fair ; the peasantry especially , since they have little other than Saxon blood and date back to before the Normans cam .. The Celts are another story still , and an older race , even . ) I guess you would call him handsome , except that he lisped terribly and worked his eyebrows all the time as he talked ; I thought he looked like a freak at a fair , in his laces and silks ,  | with rouged cheeks and hair always crimped from the irons . Humphrey said he and William Bagot had been rivals for the king 's favors , not so long ago , and Bagot had won , so Cambridge was forever taking it out on everyone else about him . I had learned by now to take Humphrey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might well have been true . He and Bagot certainly had no love for each other . Myself , I would not give a fig for either , though Bagot did not lisp . At first I had thought it a full lie , thinking of incest , and that the king was Cambridge 's own first cousin ; but then , in the dark of our bedroom , I blushed again , remembering they were men . I was not unhappy , the contrary , rather , for there was so much that was new here , and much to occupy me besides . I was not even homesick , though I thought , once in a while , of the Lady Kat in her convent , and even , when poor Malbon was clumsy , of Joan Waring . I spoke once of the lady to Richard , and his face lit ; such a woman , he said , if she had been younger and then he broke off . But he said one day he would send for her , command her to court from her nunnery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Two weeks went by , and it was April , and true to itself , raining . One day , the most dismal , I was left alone , for the king had gone , with much of the court , too , to visit at a manor in the south , where the fishing was good , for it was Lent . Humphrey and I had been left , I know not why , perhaps because they would have masques there , too . But Humphrey had waked with a runny nose and hot cheeks and could not get out of bed . While his man tended him , I wandered about the Tower , looking for something to do . I liked often to be alone , when I could not , but this day I was restless and could find nothing to amuse myself with . We boys knew all the men-at-arms well , for we roamed pretty much at will , except in the women 's quarters , so no one even noticed me . Richard 's men-at-arms were always lazy , also , and chosen mainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , gaming and gossiping , for the most part . I had been often to the Lion Tower  --  there was no novelty ? but I liked still to watch the black panther-beast , so I went there again . On this day , though , so gloomy and dark , he saddened me with his fruitless pacing and his look of blunted fury , and I turned to leave . I heard light voices on the stair and stepped back  | into the shadows . A group of girls flitted past me in light dresses , like nymphs on some antique vase ; their perfume almost knocked me over , for the air was close and full of the lion smell , too . One passed so close that her full breast rubbed against my shoulder , for she was tall ; she turned to stare and said something , in French it was , I suppose , though I did not know the language as well as I thought , for she spoke very fast . They all came clustering around me then , and I dropped to one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though they had never seen a boy before . They were the queen 's damsels , certainly ; she must be let out from her sickroom . I spoke carefully in French , what I had been taught , " Bonger , " it came out , for I had seen it written always , and they laughed like blue jays and stood watching me with bright eyes . I tried again . " Moy , " I said , pointing at my chest . " Moy , Henry ? Henry Lancaster . . . . " I was mouthing loud , as you do to foreigners , and getting red to boot . They kept on laughing , and I began to get angry and think I could never , never like girls , when one of them , the full-breasted one , took my hand , and raised me up . " It is Henry of Lancaster , " she said to the others in perfect English . They nodded and twittered again in French , all speaking at once . It was like a little hell full of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were all pointing to themselves and saying names , their own , I guess , but I could not hear one for the other . Full-breast spoke to me kindly ; she had a full , high-cheeked face , too . " They mostly can understand English , if it is spoken slow . . . they can not speak it much yet . I am Morgause  --  or , you might say , Morgan . . . . " " Morgan le Fay ! " I cried , delighted . " You are the Welsh one ! " " You have Welsh ? " she asked , her eyes alight . " I was brought up in Monmouth and spoke it always when I was little . " " I am Morgan ab Owen , " she said . " Morgan , daughter of Owen , " I translated . She laughed , delighted . " You shall have a kiss for that ! " And , taking my face between her hands , she kissed me sweetly , while all the others giggled . They all kissed me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel foolish , and like that boy in Greece , Heracles '  | friend , whom the nymphs dragged down in the pool to drown . For they were truly dressed that way ; I learned later it was a fashion Richard set for them , his own invention and fancy , and very charming , too , for they were all very young and , except for Morgan , slender as water-reeds . They wore soft , pale colors , barely tinted , in some floating stuff that you could see through ; I was embarrassed when I looked at Morgan , though I liked it , too . " Which is the queen ? " I whispered , taking her hand . " Come , " she said . " It is the black beast she loves best ; he eats from her hand . " She led me into the room with the cage , leaving the others . A girl stood there , her hand thrust in through the bars ; the fierce black panther was licking her fingers , his yellow eyes closed in ecstasy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her lips . We watched , scarcely breathing , while the little queen took more marchpane from her girdle-pouch and fed it to him . He ate delicately , nibbling like a kitten . " C'est tout , " she said , and for a miracle I understood it ; of course she held out her palms , empty , so it was easy . She stood yet a moment ; the panther lay down on his side and yawned , showing a wicked array of teeth . He covered his face then , with his paws , and slept , as cats do , all at once . She turned and looked at me . She wore white , filmy like the others , but girdled in black velvet ; there was a fine veil over her face , which blurred her features a little , though one could see they were fine . I wondered if she had had the smallpox ; actually I had had no blemish from my measles . She raised it , though , to look at me , and I saw her skin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sweet ; I loved her from that instant . I can not describe her well , perhaps because I felt something for her , and it clouded my perception , or perhaps it was that I knew her such a short while . I think her face was not girlish , but a little stern , its lines all straight and neat but tender of expression . Her hair was in a sort of black velvet net , but it was a soft , fine light brown ; her eyes were gray . Morgan spoke to her quickly , in French ; I heard the words , " de Lancaster . " The queen pointed to herself , " Isabelle , " she said , holding out her hand . I took it and held it , staring stupidly . She said my name , pronouncing it " Awnree . " It sounded prettier than the English , and I smiled . She raised her hand to my lips ; I had forgotten my manners as I gawked . I fell to one knee and  | kissed her hand . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my hair and with a little tug pulled me to my feet , giggling . I lost my stricken awe of her then , for she sounded like the rest of the girls , only quieter . And that was my meeting with my queen . All that time while the court was away and Humphrey 's cold mending I spent with the little queen and her damsels . Richard had given her the best apartments in the Tower ; they were airy and large , with many windows and wide doors that opened out onto the gardens . They soon lost their language-shyness with me ; I found they spoke English right well , if Frenchly.The queen and Morgan had Latin , too , so we could all understand one another well . Sometimes , when it was fine , they would all come into the tiltyard to watch us practice with our swords and lances . The pages had more training years than I and did well , but I did better ; it was like a sickness with me always that I must be first at everything that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work in secret and alone . At my Latin and sums , no one cared , for very few would knot their brains with such things , deeming them unmanly . I can not fool myself , though , that older boys could like me well for beating them at tilting or at tennis . Often I caught a black look from one or the other of them , and would have to go out of my way another time to defer to them , asking their advice in some matter of arms or the like , pretending in a way that my winnings were an accident . So many of us noble boys had like names , such as Henry or Richard or Edward , the little French girls would be all confused . Morgan , who had a pretty wit , gave us nicknames , such as Richard Longshanks , a boy taller than all the others and very thin , or Edward Shockhead , who had a stubborn cowlick which would not stay combed . She called me Harry Long-Twist , at which all the older pages laughed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was beginning , here at court , to take all the dirty meanings . She frowned though and said she meant nothing of the sort , for I was a little boy yet ; she pointed out how my face was long and leaned , she said , to one side . I was angry with her after , till she let me cuddle her in a dark corner of the garden and pinch her in places , too ; she whispered , laughing , that in time the other meaning would be true , too , and so I forgave her . All the boys were after Morgan , for she was the biggest , and I would see them staring at her nipples showing through the thin stuff of her dress ,  | but she never , that I could see , went apart with any of them , except that once with me , or even wrestled on the chamber floor , giggling and pretending to learn the art , as so many of the other girls did . We had music , too , and dancing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the guitar , too , though it was new to me , and I never got the hang of it then . One girl , Yolande , with great dark eyes , Saracen-slit at birth to make them even larger , had a kind of guitar , round , with a very long neck I forget its name  --  on which she used to play melancholy airs with a rough and haunting sound ; she was from Navarre , in the south , and even her French was strange . We held a little court there , of our own , while Richard was away . And so we whiled away some of our days ; Humphrey was up from his bed now , too , though he still sniffled , and chewed garlic against the infection , so that all the damsels held their noses when he came near . The week of Good Friday Richard came back to celebrate the Easter and attend mass in his own chapel . It was a fair , sunny day for once , and not raining , though the grass was wet from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the garden ; some of the boys and girls were playing blindman 's buff ; for once none were rolling on the ground in the wrestling game , though the girls , some of them , had their skirts kilted high for running . I was sitting with the queen and two others -I forget who ; she was trying to place my fingers on the guitar strings . Her fine brown hair hung down beside her cheeks ; there was a high , fresh wind , and it blew bits of her hair into my mouth . I spat them out , laughing . We heard a voice from the wide doorway , that high , emperor voice of Richard . " What , Lancaster , would you steal my queen ? " " Sire ! " I cried and fell to my knees . The little queen , always so decorous , leaped up then and ran to throw herself into his arms . llc laughed and picked her up , covering her face with kisses . " 1 low is it with my little Flowerface ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than a marriage of state ; but it was plain that Richard loved her well in his way . He walked about the gardens with her , easy and gay , quipping with the pages and twitching the girls ' dresses down and wagging his finger at them . They shrieked with laughter and ran to kiss him , too . He looked at me . " Get up , you great booby , " he said , " and come give us a cousinkiss , too . " I jumped up from my knees then and ran to him ,  | where he whirled me around , and planted a kiss on each cheek , in the French fashion . " I swear by God 's boots you have grown , boy ! " " Oh , sire it is just three weeks ! " But I was pleased . Never had my father acted so toward me or looked with such liking on me . Richard put an arm about each of our shoulders , his Isabelle 's and mine . " Shall we walk a little  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He admired the flowers that grew there the little Isabelle knew all their names , in French , Latin , and English and he plucked a small stalk of white lilies , like little bells , and tucked it in her untidy hair . " Lily of the valley , " she said , laughing , and its French name , too , but I have forgot . " We will have a fine Easter . . . I have brought back some jugglers and dancing girls and thirty new cooks for pastry . . . . " She clapped her hands ; she was more of a child than I knew . " And then , " said Richard , with a high gay humor , " then , I am off to the Irish wars ! " Her little , stern , marble face crumpled into soft flesh ; she cried , " Oh , no , my Lord . . . Oh , no . . . you will be killed ! " And she broke then into a torrent of French . Richard laughed and gathered her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . I do not mean to give them a chance . . . come , dry your eyes . . . they are getting all red . . . . " He held her head to his chest and spoke to me over . " You , Harry would you like to go to war with me ? " " Oh , sire , " I cried , wild with joy . I , too , was more of a child than I knew .  | On Easter day , to celebrate Christ risen and the end of the Lenten fasting , there was a magnificent banquet : I have never seen its like before or since . There were oxen in the hundreds , roasted whole , and stuffed with geese and spices , suckling pigs , candied , and filled with fruit , and all manner of other foods , including a marvelous pie , huge , out of which , when cut , there flew a miracle of live doves . Of course , that was not for eating , but to show the pastry cook 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done , though Humphrey , sitting next to me , said the top crust was put on just before , of course , and baked separately . This cousin of mine , though slow at his studies , was shrewd in ways most people would not bother thinking of ; I still am not sure , anyway , that he was right , for it steamed clear to the roof as it was brought to table . There were huge ices , too , depicting Richard 's White Hart symbol , and a red-colored one , like a dragon , in honor of the guest of Wales . It melted , though , as it was set before him , so that its shape was blurred , and I saw the Welshman , at Richard 's right hand , laugh and draw his hand across his throat as if he jested at his doorn . Richard banged his fist , making the dishes jump , and drew down his brows , but the man put his arm familiarly across the king 's shoulders and whispered in his ear , so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course , what he said , but I heard afterward that he saved the poor ice sculptor 's neck . We sat with the pages and the queen 's maids above the great saltcellar , for we were all noble , but there were so many above us , to take precedent , that a sea of white napery separated us from the king . He sat with little Isabelle on his left and the stranger on the other side . For a wonder , Morgan sat beside this man , instead of with the rest of us ; I whispered to Humphrey that this must be Owen Glendower , back from France , for I had heard Richard say that Morgan was his natural daughter . Humphrey argued , as usual , for he always wanted to be first with any news , and said no , the man must be an Irish king , there were so many of them .  | " But we are going to war against the Irish , " I said , thinking to settle it . " No matter , " he answered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is one of the friendly ones . " I pointed out , coldly , that the ice had been dragon-shaped , if melting , and red to boot , and that the lordly stranger wore a great red dragon emblazoned all over the front of his surcoat ; the red dragon has been the symbol of Wales since the time of Uther Pendragon and of Arthur . Humphrey , of course , knew little of heraldry , never dipping his nose into a book if he could avoid it . He subsided , muttering that all men knew the Welsh were small and dark . I stopped arguing and craned my neck to get a look , though , for sure , I had not to move it overmuch , for the man was head and shoulders taller than any other . Richard , beside him , looked like a boy , and he was middling tall himself . Whoever he is , I thought , he looks like King Arthur , or rather , as I imagined Arthur to have been . He wore his hair long , right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fashion , middle parted ; his beard , too , was forked in the middle and trimmed neatly into two perfect points , like all the old paintings . Beard and hair both were the color of deep tarnished gold , or like a lion 's mane , and around his brow was a thin circlet of some dark metal . He was older than Richard , but not by much ; he had an ageless look . Even at this distance I knew I would never see again a face of such pure pride . He is a Brython , I said to myself , out of the old songs , of that race that was here long before any Celt , even , set foot on these shores . I was so busy with my musings that I did not hear the silence that fell when the musicians stopped or feel the pages ' eyes ; Humphrey nudged me hard . " It is your turn , " he hissed , " to pour the wine . " I jumped to my feet , nearly tripping over my robe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and grabbed up the great pitcher . Richard held the bottom of the pitcher as I poured for him , to steady it ; his blue eyes glinted at me , laughing . Putting one arm about my waist where I stood , he said , " I saw you gawk , fair cousin , at our guest . . . you were , perhaps , bewitched ? " And a great roar of laughter went up from the lords who sat near , making my face go hot with shame . " Softly , Dickon , " said the stranger , hunching his wide shoulders and cackling in the voice of an old crone , " or your English  | will burn my poor bones . . . . " I stared , holding the pitcher ; the man 's face , even , was transformed , and an old , old woman looked out of it , a toothless hag , for an instant , and then was gone . The laughter came again , for the man certainly had magic , of the mummer 's sort , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smiling now . " Not in my time , " he said . " Not in my time , my Owen , will you burn . . . . " I saw there was much real love between them , of a manly sort , and more , a measuring of each , and a surety . " Have I not a fair lad here ? " said Richard , his arm still around me . " My young cousin Hal . . . . " " Very fair , " said Owen , for of course it was he , and I was right for once . " I have seen faces like his in Sicily . . . or painted on old Etruscan walls . . . . " I saw his eyes , deep-set under high cheekbones ; they were the color of his hair , yellow amber like the panther-beast in the cage . " But take your hand from him , Dickon . . . he is too young to be your play-maiden . . . . " He said this last very low , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Richard 's anger . It never came though ; it seemed this Owen could say all he pleased . Richard merely smiled and shrugged , giving me a little push away . " It is not that , " I heard him say as I went . " It is that I wish he were my son . . . . " They spoke low together then , and I could not hear . But passing behind them later to fill the glasses on the left , I heard Glendower say , " I saw Derby in France . . . " and then , something like " some powerful friends . . . dangerous . . . . " Richard clapped his hands then and said loudly , " No more , Hal , for the damsels . . . I do not want them puking all down their new gowns . . . and it is their bedtime , too , and the pages ' . . . . Off with you , my pretty , " he said , smacking his little queen loudly on the lips @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our chambers , feeling we were missing everything . I would have liked to have eavesdropped more talk of my father ; I had not thought of him in weeks , and my guilt rode me , like a demon . Humphrey had eaten too much and had too much wine , too . He vomited several times during the night ; I could hear him in the water closet as I lay awake , thinking . Dawn was beginning to send gray fingers through our latticed  | window ; Humphrey climbed into bed , white and shaken from his last spasm . He saw I was still awake and asked , curiously , " Are you sick , too ? By Christ , there is surely nothing left in me ! " " No , " I said , " not that . But I am thinking . . . . " And in a rare mood of confidence , I said , " And praying . . . . " " Praying ! " he exclaimed . " All night ? What for ? " I felt foolish , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . that he that a miracle will happen , and he will come back , somehow . . . . " Even in his weakness , Humphrey sat up from the pillow ; I could see his mouth had fallen open in surprise , for the light was stronger already . " Sweet Jesus , " he said , " you are the greenest of the green boys from the country . Have n't you yet figured out why you are here ? You are Richard 's hostage , his guarantee . . . in case your father gets up to anything over there in France or wherever . . . If once your father sets foot in England , forget your prayers . . . Richard will have your head . " I did not say what Richard 's words had been , that he wanted me for a son , nor mentioned that scrap of talk I heard , disquieting , about my father 's dangerous companions . My thoughts whirled this way and that ; I heard Humphrey snore , for all his sick feelings , before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ troubled sleep .  | In May we set out for Ireland . We went from Tower Wharf by barge ; all the damsels were crowded at St. Thomas ' Gate to bid us good-bye , except for Morgan , or Morgause Owain , as the queen and all her ladies called her , in the French way . Morgause had gone back to Wales with her father to live in his great new manor house there , with Owen 's youngest legitimate daughter , Catherine , under the care of the half-English wife whom Welshmen called the Argyllwyddes . Morg , as I always thought of her , had bade me farewell with tears in her eyes and a great wild kiss , which surprised me , for I always had thought of her as a maiden of light , jesting spirit . I was surprised , also , to see how much I missed her , after . Richard traveled in great style , as I guess he did always , but it seemed foolish to me to go to war in such a manner . Humphrey , whose company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he being so poor in the use of arms , said it would be no real war but just a sop to the commons , who loved conquest . There were minstrels , embroiderers , body servants , and as many as three hundred cooks , truly ! To say nothing of all the baggage , horses , hounds , caged birds , and more that I can not remember even . There were a hundred barges , so it took us most of a day to get started . Isabelle had no eyes for me at all , but clung to Richard , weeping bitterly , until finally he had to bid her ladies take her inside . He went in the first barge with his favorite , William Bagot , both dressed as though for a court ball . They had to be carried on board , on account of their pointed shoes and their sleeves , which hung , sweeping the ground . Humphrey and I rode far behind , in a barge with the horses , and some men-at-arms . The poor animals were afraid and neighed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ North Sea we changed to sail , and Humphrey was sick . I truly think that this cousin of mine ailed mysteriously , for he had always a queasy stomach and his nose ran most of the time , whenever the wind changed ; also , his breath came hard from his  | chest in certain seasons . So it was not just seasickness . Many of the men-at-arms suffered from this ; they looked so wretched that I thanked sweet Jesus I was a good sailor , for they say it is something that can not be controlled , but is a gift from God only . There was no great fighting in Ireland ; we lodged in splendor at Dublin Castle and had lessons from tutors , and studying , just as though we were at home . I say home , for in so short a time I came to look upon my life with Richard as my homelife , odd to say . But then he was ever kind and affectionate to me ; I was never beaten either or even spoken to in harshness . My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were skirmishes , it is true , where soldiers would go out against some of the rebel Irish chieftains ; usually , though , they would return without trophies and sometimes without even a sight of the enemy . The land was so strange to us English , shrouded in mist , and with treacherous bogs underfoot , the harrying tribes seemed to melt away . I asked Richard why he did not get some guides from the friendly Irish we lived among , for they sure must know the land , and then it was their holdings which were being plundered and laid low , so it seemed to have sense in it . He looked at me quizzically , stroking his little golden beard , and said , " It is perhaps a thought . . . . You are a canny lad , my Hal . . . . " I felt it strange that he had not thought of it himself , and he must have read my feelings , as he could so often , for he said , musingly , " Oh , Hal . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no love for war . . . . My people do not love me for it either . " He sat a moment , thinking , with a sad look , of a sort , on his face . " Look you , Hal . . . we have been at peace with the French all my reign , where we have had nothing but raids from them on our shores these many years before . The Welsh , too , love me , and the Scots . . . . For more than ten years none of our young men have died in battle , and the women all have husbands and do not crowd the brothels of the cities . . . even here , in Ireland , there is no great shakes of trouble , a few petty chiefs from the peat bogs , who are always about , like outlaws , living off the land , and what they can pilfer . I came here only to satisfy the Parliament , and the lords and commons . . . it seems they can not bear a peace-minded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had said , that Richard had beggared the land with his lavishness and waste , his  | pomp and splendor , but I dared not speak . Again he read me , though , for he said , " Do you think that war is not expensive ? . . . . Then you have never seen it . . . . In my father 's time , and him all men loved , there was famine so heavy on the land that the starving people fought over rats and vermin and killed one another for a cat 's carcass . . . . He was the great victor of Crecy , and the commons went wild with joy at the sight of him when he rode abroad . Yet still , beneath the surface , there was hatred for all the nobles , and the commons rose , after he died , and I was king . . . I was only fourteen . . . but I was brave , then , too ? perhaps you will not believe it . . . I rode out to face them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sire , " I said , eagerly , " and they loved you and hailed you as their young savior . I have heard it . . . . " " They were brave men , " said Richard , " those peasants , Wat and the rest . . . never let men tell you other . . . They had their greatness . John Ball , who died so horribly I think he was a saint truly . . . . I tried to give those men what they wanted , but I had so many about me , so many bullies . . . and I was young . . . . I could not prevail , for they had the charter of rule , Thomas , my uncle of Woodstock . . . . " His face , so mild , looked almost as black as my father 's for a moment . My skin crawled ; it was Humphrey 's father , murdered , as he had told me , who was that Uncle Thomas . Richard 's face cleared , and he went on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gaunt , had been there . . . . But he was in Spain , struggling for his Spanish kingdom . . . and so the commons lost all . . . . But they will win , someday , Hal . . . they will win  --  not in my time or yours but all rules change , and give way to other needs . . . . I have tried to give them a little . . . peace , and some small , piddling laws of benefit . . . but they do not love me for it . . . . They begrudge mc , even , my little vanities . . . . " And , at this , his voice grew pettish , and he tossed his head peevishly , like a woman . I was silent , for I knew him wrong ... . and right , too , under . . . . He was a man of many parts and not easy to understand , especially for a boy . But with all his faults , I had grown , in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not happy though to see no fighting , and begged to be let go with the soldiers . I was a boy , after all , and forgot much that Richard had said to me , wanting to try my arts of battle . He gave  | in to me and let me go on some of the forays , but I held arms only for the knights , and never even saw a barbarian , or a bog even . It is a long story , so I will not tell it all , but part only . I had brought with me my play warriors and spent much time , at night , moving them about in battle positions and studying , though Humphrey laughed . I had made friends , too , with some of the younger Irish squires and had a map drawn for me of the lands about that place . There was a stream along one side where there was sometimes fighting , but in the mists the Irish outlaws would ever slip away , before they could be caught . We lost some men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nowhere and spears thrown , too . I surmised the Irish enemies had a ford-place and so crossed , before we could ever meet with them , after they slew a few of ours . So we figured , studying the map and moving the soldier pieces about , that we could force them to a deep place they could not ford and so hem them about and win . There were ten of us English boys , and about twice as many Irish , anxious to get our taste of war , and fretting , and we were all in on it . Now the barbarians always made their forays at dawn when the mists were thickest . We plotted to sneak away in the night , before any called us back or saw us even , and lie in wait for the enemy 's dawn raid in this place . I did not want Humphrey to come , for I was afraid for his life  --  he had so little skill but he insisted , so I made him promise to carry the extra arms only . I thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my first time of fighting , ever , but I have forgot all the same . There have been so many others . It worked , my plan , that is all I really know , and we were all knighted for it in the end . Now I can just remember that loose-boweled feeling , waiting ; lying on our bellies in the bog , our fronts all muddy , while the sky grew faintly gray . I know an arrow whizzed past me where I lay , making a sound louder than I could have ever thought , and I saw dim shapes and whispered , " Come on ! " We jumped to our feet , yelling , and forced them into deep water and so won them , almost all . I killed my first man that day , and that I remember well . I could not see him clearly till he was upon me , where I waded out after them . He rose up before me , all dripping , with a spear turned toward my belly . I had thrown mine already but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his eyes and came out in back , above his bronze collar . He looked surprised and sank back into the water . When I pulled out the sword , a great gush of the man 's blood came with it , making the water red all about . We dragged the dead ashore ; there were more than thirty , so each of us had had his kill . My spear , too , was in one , but I could not count that , for I had thrown blindly . When we brought the dead back to the castle , I threw that man over Humphrey 's saddle , for his claim , though I knew he had not loosed a weapon . Our horses had not been blooded before and screamed and neighed in terror all the way back ; if any others of the barbarians had been about , it would have been our death , but we were lucky , like first-time players at dice . Richard was like some old nursemaid , railing at us and wringing his hands ; " Sweet Jesus , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ killed ! What would your mothers say . . . they would have my neck . . . . " I had a long scratch down my arm , maybe from the arrow I heard go past , or maybe I scratched it later on my enemy 's rough-made collar , but he went wild over it , as though it were something dreadful ; it did not hurt even . I felt a fool among the other boys , with the physician tut-tutting and salving me and binding up my arm from wrist to shoulder , while Richard hovered , scolding . He knighted me after , though , along with all our ten English boys who had been with me . It was , after all , about the only bloodshed in those Irish wars . There was a banquet to celebrate , and Richard , all dressed in state and crowned with his best gold crown , touched us each lightly on the shoulder with his jeweled sword that had never seen battle . I - was first and can not remember his words . I thought , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arise , fair Knight ! " But that is not the way it went . We had with us in our company a Frenchman , by name Creton , a noble , but I forget his rank . He was more minstrel than soldier and wrote down much of what happened . I have it by me still , though the man himself is long dead ; it is in fair metrical verse and courtly French , so his words are not probably exact but flowered-up , as the French do . But he quotes Richard , and I have his writings before me , " My Fair Cousin , henceforth be gallant and bold , for unless you conquer you will have little name for valor . " Thinking upon it now , I wonder if he meant it as a  | satire , in part , after he had complained to me that day of his subjects ' lack-love for him . I do not know , and anyway , I misdoubt the Frenchman 's words somewhat , for in that same poem he describes me as " a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rising twelve !  | Just three days after my knighting I had dressed for the evening meal , buckling on my sword , which as new-made knight I had leave to wear ; there was a scratch at my door , and when I bade them enter , it was a petty clerk of Richard 's , a man whose face I barely knew . He addressed me without title , saying , in a too-loud voice , " You are to keep to your room ; the king commands it ! " He turned without ceremony , twitching his heavy clerk 's gown , and went out . It was the first time I had been spoken to as less than a great-grandson of a king ; this man , in particular , had always fawned upon me , praising my letters and the like . I was astonished . The door opened a crack then , and Humphrey came in , sideways , like a sneak-thief . " What ails you ? " I said . His face was white as tallow . " I would not be in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not for all the treasure of the Saracens . Richard is wild and hurling things about , cursing Derby and swearing vengeance . . . . He has left table and bid everyone be gone , too , so that we simply grabbed what was on our plates and fled . It is maybe all we will get tonight . . . . " He drew from under his surcoat some greasy drumsticks wrapped in a napkin , a small round cheese , and a comb of honey , dripping . " I am not hungry , " I said . " What do you think it means ? " In spite of my efforts , my voice cracked ; it had been doing that lately . The first time it happened , Richard had jested that he must lock up the Irish maidens . Ilurnphrey sat on the bed , heavily , still holding the food . " Here , give me that stuff , " I said . " You are messing the whole place . " " I do not know , " said Humphrey , " except @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " We stared at each other , not daring to guess . I do not know how long we sat there , while the light ebbed and the room grew dim . Neither of our body servants were about , and we were  | afraid to shout for them , so we lit the candles ourselves , spilling the wax over our fingers . When the latch of the door lifted , we jumped as if it were a thunderclap . It was our cousin Edward of Aumerle ; he , too , came in sidling , as if the fiends were after him . He shut the door , too , behind him , and slid the bolt . Coming close to me , he said , softly , " Listen , Harry . . . your father has landed at Ravenspur four days ago with six men . . . . " My God , he is dead now , I thought . " What happened , Cousin ? " My throat was dry , and the words croaked . He put his hand on my shoulder . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " His mild face wore a look of fear . " We hear that Northumberland , with Harry Percy , too , and Willoughby and Greystock have all ridden to join him . It is revolt . . . they are marching westward across Yorkshire to your father 's duchies to take them back from the king . . . . By now they may easily have twenty thousand men . . . . They are joined all along their way by other nobles , discontent . . . . God knows where it will end . . . . " Humphrey sank back upon the bed , sobbing loud . " Oh , before Jesus , Harry . . . he will kill you now . . . . Richard will kill you . . . . Our cousin shook him roughly . " Be still ! " He turned to me . " Come , follow me . The king wishes to talk with you . " Humphrey , quiet now , looked up at me with horror . " Oh , Harry , " he said , very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . " " No , " I said , and my voice seemed to come from far away to my own ears . " No , " I said again , " he is only coming to get back his inheritance that was seized . . . . " " But you are hostage for him . . . . " His words trailed off , and he looked at me in horror , as though I were a corpse already . " Peace now , Humphrey ! " exclaimed our cousin , more sharply . He looked at me . " Take off your sword , " he said . " It looks bad .... " Richard was in his own chamber , where I had never been before . It was lit by torchlight only ; his face was like a white mask in the gloom . Bagot and some other lords were with him ; we had heard Richard 's voice , railing , thin with hysteria , as we came along the hall . But he was quiet now . He snapped his fingers at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , slinking like ferrets . " You , also , " said Richard , with the ghost of a smile , his eyes  | slewing around to our cousin , where he stood , his face set in apprehension . " I will not behead him just yet . . . I heard the door close behind Aumerle and fell to my knees . " Oh , sire , " I said . I do not know what I said . It is long ago . I have looked it up in the Frenchman 's chronicle-poem ; he was not there , of course , but this is what I read . I have read it other places , too . " In truth , my gracious king and lord , I am sincerely grieved by these tidings , and , as I conceive , you are fully assured of my innocence in this proceeding of my father . " What prig or imbecile could have uttered such words at such a time ? I probably said nothing but knelt there , shaking . Richard raised me up and seated me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can not think your father loves you . . . . I , for sure , would never leave my son to a great king 's mercy while I ran wild , my heart black with revolt and gathering armies at my back . . . . Unless , of course , he thinks me , perhaps , a soft woman-ninny . Which , for sure , I see I am . . . for I will not hurt you , Hal . . . I read your misery well . . . and besides , I have much love for you . Never have I known a fairer , finer youth . . . . Oh , Hal , " he said , softly , and his white face streamed with tears , " my Hal . . . I would have made you my heir . . . . " I fell to sobbing then , too , and flung my arms around him wildly , for all he was my king . It was my huge relief , I guess , that snapped the string . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forgot , in that moment , all the injustice he had done my father . So powerful are sweet embraces and fair words , especially to the lonely young . " What will you do to my father ? " I whispered , finally . Richard laughed a small laugh , hollow-sounding . " It is the other way around , I fear . . . . " Then he straightened up and stood . " We will have to fight , " he said . " And God , I pray , will be with the victor . " Ile kissed me tenderly , then , on both my cheeks , embracing nw , and saying he would send me away and out of it . To the Castle of " Prim he would send me , and Humphrey , too , to be under the care of the Lady Ulster there , while the civil war raged . We rode to Ulster next day , Humphrey and I , he marveling that I was in my whole skin , and I sunk deep in thought . I did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for he was always either too cold or too hot , or his saddle too small or too big , and such like moanings ; I was used to it . In truth , it was a  | hot ride , for summer comes early in those parts , and we never stopped to rest but to change horses only . When we reached Ulster and the Castle of Trim , he had to be lifted from his saddle , burning with fever , and by the morning he was dead . The chroniclers would have it that he was poisoned by Richard , but that could not be ; we two had eaten all the same foods . Besides it made no sense , for if he would poison any , surely it would have been me , though I am sure he would not have done that either . My heart was almost bursting , though , with grief for my first good friend and cousin and with worry for my father and Richard , too . It seemed to me that I was torn between those two men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bright green day , the Lady of Ulster and I. She was a sweet , kind lady , and much moved by my grief . She had masses said for Humphrey 's soul , paid for out of her own pocket , for my allowance I had not liked to ask for from Richard , though it was due . As for Richard , him I never saw again in this world .  | When I first came back to Wales , to live in my father 's house , I had thought I 'd queen it a bit over the other girls there , because of having spent so much time at the French court . But this was impossible , I saw from the first ; all the maidens of Owen 's house , even the lowborn ones , speak French nearly as well as I do myself , though their accents are comical . Also , they are very learned , with as many tutors as boys have in other places ; Owen 's ideas are all very modern , in spite of his dressing in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simply his whim ; he likes to pose as a king-hero out of the old Welsh legends . At first you think it is strange and forbidding , but after you know him it is endearing rather ; you can see that he likes to act , to play parts the way children do . For instance , at the French court , where he was a sort of ambassador for Richard , he was the most courtly creature you could imagine . He trimmed his hair and shaved his beard and wore the latest fashions , the very short tunic that shows the leg all the way up the thigh , and the huge slashed sleeves ; the French all thought he was the most polished courtier in the world . And then when I went to England in Isabelle 's train I heard him called the Welsh magician . It seems he dressed up as Merlin once , in flowing robes and a cone-shaped long hat like those you will see in old pictures  --  and put on a show at court , looking into a crystal ball and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if it were a magic language . He pretended to call the wind , like old Merlin , too , but it seems he had noticed that a storm was brewing , and so it came , and the big wind came with it , as if at his command . He and Richard had a good laugh over it afterward , but the whole thing got about , and tales were told of it , and so the people think he really knows magic . Here in Wales he goes about bearded , with the old bronze crown of Prince Madoc on ( it looks like a thin metal string ) and wearing the ancient sword of Eliseg , that is only half as long as a modern one , and made of iron ; it could not cut through butter . But the Welsh  | people , especially the hill folk , think he is Arthur , come again . I do not say this about him to talk slightingly of him but simply to explain ; I have a great love for him , and gratitude , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way Owen treats us . Also , I am certain that he knows more about every subject that there is under the sun than any other man living ; there can be no question of that once you have heard him speak at any length . I was in France so long , and England after , that I had forgotten what Wales looked like . Owen had taken me to France when I was only three years old , to get me away from my mother . I will have to explain this ; Mother was Lowry ferch Morgan , ferch Lowry , ferch Morgan , and so on , supposedly back to the first Morgan , that I am named after who was the one of Arthur 's time . That is , of course , ridiculous , but here they will believe anything . Anyway , Mother was the last prophetess of Dinas Bran ; Dinas Bran is an old , old stronghold , and looks it , too . It is supposed to date back to the first settlers of Wales , who came from some place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a continent that sank long ago into the sea . I think it is really silly , but Owen says not to say that sort of thing here . The prophetess thing is supposed to be hereditary and handed down from mother to daughter , and that is supposed to go back to when Wales was a matriarchy , meaning ruled by women . I guess it might have been so once , but it is certainly a misty dream by now , to say the least . Anyhow the prophetesses lived there , in Dinas Bran , sort of like queens , and had maidens , like nuns a bit , and they all worshiped Saint Derfel , who used to be a god before the Christians came , and also , some old goddess called Epona . And they would come out once every year , in the spring , I guess , and bless the crops and cut a poor little lamb 's throat over the ground to make it fertile ( it used to be a human sacrifice , Owen says , but that makes me shudder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everywhere , with executions and wars ) and then they would dabble their fingers in the poor thing 's blood and prophesy . And then they  --  the prophetesses , I mean  --  would bed with the Chosen One , and the daughter would be the next prophetess ! ( I do n't know what they did if it turned out to be a boy ; strangle it , I guess . ) I mean you ca n't imagine such things going on in modern times . But it did , up until I was born , Owen being the Chosen One at that time . I asked him how he could  | have gone along with that kind of thing it is so pagan , really  - -  but he just laughed and said my mother was very beautiful . ( There must have been a good many beauties around a little earlier , because there are quite a few children running around the palace that look like Owen . He is what they call a lusty man , or used to be , at any rate . ) But Owen put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he broke the chain , as it were . He stole me when I was a little baby , and Mother kept plotting to get me back , and finally he took me out of the country . Mother was so enraged and grief-stricken that she killed herself ; she was found hanging by an old girdle , which the people insisted was Princess Myfanwy 's which would make it about a thousand years old and too rotten to do the job . But Owen says , though they are a wonderful people , you can not talk sense to the Welsh . I sound awfully mean and disrespectful about Mother , but , after all , I did n't know her at all . And I certainly would n't have wanted to be a priestess or whatever it was . And afterward , all the little nuns ran away and became whores at the Tassel Inn , where all the English border soldiers stay . Owen says they were quite wanton anyway , really , and not a bit like Christian nuns . When I first saw Glyndyvrdwy Llyys , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is the last time I will call it that ; I was just trying to show off . It took me a morning to figure out how to spell it in English . From now on it will be simply Glendower House . You really could n't call it a castle  --  it is so different . Owen designed it himself , drawing plans and supervising everything . Now every castle or great manor I have ever seen is made of stone , and always , also , looks more like a fortress , with hardly any windows , except arrow-slit openings . But this Llyys , or mansion house , of Owen 's is wood ! It is true that there is stone under , but all you can see is wood , smoothed and polished so that it looks almost like ivory , except that it is very dark . Owen had it brought by ship all the way from Cathay ; the Genoese make such trips often they have very fast , strong ships . Owen went on the first trip to pick out the trees ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and will probably never wear out . It is a very difficult palace to describe , Owen 's , being so different , but I will try . All around the whole thing is a wall , not very high , of this teak wood , too , over stone , and inside there are lots and lots of buildings ; dwellings , barns , stables , storehouses , and everything you can think of , al- most like a city . Except that it is all low , just one story high . Only the main house , in the middle , has two stories ; the top story is all for the women , and is where we live . The downstairs of this building is one huge hall , with a big chimney , built of bricks , in the middle . It is square-built , and there is a hearth on each side , so there are four fireplaces , which do a good job of heating , better than anywhere else I 've been . The upstairs is divided into four main rooms , each having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There are screens to divide all these rooms into any shape you might want or to provide privacy ; it is complicated but works very well . There are covered walkways leading to other buildings , where the men of our family sleep , and all the buildings around have men and soldiers , minstrels and bards , servants and visitors staying in them . There are no fortifications , except that there are hundreds of men-at-arms and guards right there . Owen does not like to live in a fort , he says ; life should be more gracious than that . He says it is built on the lines of a Homeric palace , that is , like very ancient Greece and how their kings lived . Homer was a great bard of that time , and you can still read him ; it has been handed down . There are descriptions of palaces in his poems , and that is how Owen found out about them . But , of course , everything depends on being rich and having a great many retainers because otherwise the place would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Greek palaces were all open , with many windows , porticoes , wide doors , and openings in the roofs , too ; of course , it was very mild there and even hot most of the time , so he could n't follow that exactly . But we do have a lot more light than most manor houses , only all the openings are glazed . Our girls ' sleeping place is open to the sky , with a glass roof , for instance , which is wonderful , sometimes , if you are wakeful and can look up at the stars , and drop off to sleep , counting them . l ; lliw , one of the maidens who live here , hates this , though , and says she feels exposed , though I have told her only eagles can see her . But she always goes about fully robed , and we have put a canopy over her bed ; so she feels comfortable . She is an odd little creature , anyway , 1 think ; she is the daughter of Rhys Dhu , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hill chieftain , so she has spent much of her early life in caves , which may explain part of it . We girls , and there are a lot of us , live all together under the  | Lady Margaret 's rule ; she is a most fair , though portly woman , Owen 's wife . The people call her the Argyllwyddes , a sort of title . It is old Welsh , which nobody understands anymore , though all the bards pretend to . Some say it means the Englishwoman ; I can hardly credit that , for she can not have more than an eighth of English blood . Her father was Sir John Hanmer , a wealthy border lord ; the family is very old , so maybe , far back , there is English , but the Welsh would count it , for they are fiercely patriotic . I speak as though I am not Welsh myself , but that is because I have spent so much time elsewhere , and also , Owen himself holds that there is little difference between men , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to say that word , , Jew , for it is a sort of epithet among Christian peoples ; he says they are Israelites and should have their correct title . He says that even the peoples of Cathay , who are very different to look at , with eyes that are unlidded and slanting upward , and broad , flat faces , and the Africans , who are black in color , are much the same as the rest of us , having different customs only . Black is a hard thing to believe , but I know that he does not lie . Anyway , as I started to say , we maidens live all together ; there is plenty of room , so we do not argue too much . First , there is Catherine , Owen 's youngest daughter ; she is the Lady Margaret 's child , too , so is the only legitimate one of us . She is a year younger than I am , just the age of Richard 's queen . People would have it that all us girls are Owen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I are his without doubt , besides Catherine . Efa is a nun 's daughter , from the convent at Valle Crucis ; her mother died giving birth . Efa herself says she is Saint Derfel 's , but everybody knows that is not true , unless he was the image of Owen . We three , his daughters , all look much like him , with tawny hair and cat-colored eyes . We are all very tall , too , like him ; I used to be too fat , but I have lost that flesh now and am slender as the others , except that I have too much up top in front . Lady Margaret makes me wear a sort of binder-cloth ; she says it is more seemly . Then there is Elliw , that I mentioned before , and two daughters of Tudor ap Griffith , Owen 's brother , named Gwynneth and ( ; wenllian ; they are twins and very beautiful , with dark , rosy skins and black eyes . They are bastards , too , though , got on some Celtic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ,  | those hill women , but the daughters are sweet maidens . They are sixteen already and marriageable , but Owen will have to dower them handsomely on account of their birth . The other damsels are of low birth and could be either Owen 's or Tudor 's , or one of the bards ' ; their mothers , though , are serving maids here . The girls ' names are Olwen , Sibli , Megolin , and Modry , and they are not treated any differently from the rest of us ; of course , they can not hope to marry well , that is all . Megolin , though , wants to be a nun . So , after I have counted , I see we are ten . We all have tutors and women who teach us sewing and weaving ; we take harp lessons from the bards , besides . In fact , we are always very busy and do not play very much , but it is pleasant here . Owen has six acknowledged sons , four bastards and two trueborn . The only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ youngest , who is about two years older than I ; they have all been studying at Oxford Town , for Wales has no university , though Owen would like to found one . Meredith was the last to go , so I met him when I came here , almost three years ago . He , again , is like us , resembling Owen ; he is fine-boned , though , and much fairer of hair , getting his coloring from the Lady Margaret . I can not remember him all that well , of course , because I saw little of him , really ; he is coming home though , almost any minute now , with all the others , and heaven only knows how many more , students all . There has been an uprising there at Oxford ; as a matter of fact , there have been a few , and all the Welsh are coming home , spoiling for a fight , and even some English with them . It seems there is a real coil there , and indeed all over in other parts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new king and his unjust laws . They are even burning people alive there ! It is too gruesome to think on , but Owen says , looking grim , that it is just beginning . Poor , sweet Richard is dead , and un-kinged , too , and Red Bolingbroke is crowned . Strange to think that little Harry LongTwist is now the crowned Prince of Wales ! One awful thing after another has been happening over there in England ; these last years have been humming with news like a beehive , even here , where we get it late . Owen must have had wind of some events to come when he fetched me from the court two years and more ago . He had just come back from France then , after all , where Henry of Bolingbroke was plotting in his exile . It is a long story , and astonishing and sad , too , so I will say it all as briefly as possi- ble . Henry of Lancaster , that is , Bolingbroke , as he is sometimes called , little Harry 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in exile , to get the ear of other nobles discontented with Richard 's rule . When he landed in England , more than threequarters of the nobles , with all their retainers , flocked to his banner ; he won the revolt and routed poor Richard , who was never warlike anyway . He forced Richard , who was by then his prisoner , to abdicate the throne ; he did not do what most people expected , place the Mortimer heir , who is the closest blood claimant , on the throne , but took the crown for himself , saying that all men begged for his kingship , and so he was forced to it . Such a thing happened long ago , said Owen , in Rome , when Julius Caesar made himself emperor by the " will of the people . " Owen says this is nonsense , of course , in both cases . As a matter of fact , Owen rode to Richard 's succor but had not time to get men enough up from Wales to do any good . And so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , some say starved to death ; murder is whispered , too . Owen says we will never know the right of it . At any rate , a body was shown , in all pomp , or rather , the head only , the whole being sealed away in a lead casket , to satisfy the people that he was dead , and not from violence , for the head bore no marks . Even so , many say that it was not Richard at all , but another man , his double , called Richard Maudelyne , and that Richard is safe in Scotland somewhere . I privately think this can not be , for I knew that man Maudelyne at court , and he was not so very like to Richard as all that . After all , though Catherine and I are sisters , and look a bit similar , no one would mistake us , in truth . Griffith , my oldest brother , saw the casket in London , and holds that it was Richard , without doubt ; he says , however that a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so one can tell from his letters that he , Griffith , at least , thinks that Richard was killed somehow ; he even names the murderer , one Piers Exton . Owen says this is hearsay but says , also , that Red Bolingbroke could not afford to let him live ? Richard , I mean . It is all very complicated and politically mixed up ; there have already been plots against the new king 's life , and his son 's , too . I am glad that Harry did not die ; he was near death from poisoning , it is said . I am so sorry for Harry ; it is easy to imagine how he must feel now . Richard was more of a father to him than ever that grim  | man who is now king . That man used to beat him with a whip ! I myself have seen the old scars on his back , long healed , and he was only eleven when I knew him . Also , it is not Red Bolingbroke 's doing that he even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was hostage there , after all , when his horrible father got up to all his tricks ! I hate him well , though I have never met him . Owen would say this is wrong , but I guess it is my mother coming out in me . They say that young Harry was drugged at his coronation , when he was made Prince of Wales ( an empty title , if there ever was one , for that is what all men call Owen , in fact ) . They say he would not do his father 's bidding and that he ran at him with a sword , the one Richard gave him 2t his knighting ; they say , also , that he accused his father of Richard 's murder and was sent off to Oxford to escape his father 's wrath . ( Who sent him , I wonder . None of it makes good sense ; Owen says all gossip must be taken with a grain of salt . ) We will learn more , of course , when my brothers come back from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was shorter than I when I knew him at Richard 's court , but I have stopped growing now ( I hope ) , and perhaps he has not ; we are the same age to a month . Of course , Owen being six feet and a half , we are all giants around here , which scares me sometimes ; I would not like to attain such a height as that , with all my suitors looking up at me ! I liked Harry well , the best of all the lads at court ; he is the handsomest , to my mind , of any , though his face does lean a little to one side , and is long and narrow . His color is like some of the Lombards I saw at the French court , dark of hair and eyes , with strong-marked brows like birds ' wings , tilting up and outward , and lips the color of watered wine . I think of him when I read of the young Alexander , the Greek boy who conquered practically all the world long ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always would beat the other boys at play tourney or feats of strength , even those older and bigger , although he never bragged . Catherine says I am half in love with him , but that is silly ; we were just children then . Catherine is very romantic , always falling in love and out , sometimes with people she has never even seen ; I suppose she thinks all girls behave her way . Anyway , I am anxious to hear news of Harry ; Meredith , I know , has the same master at Oxford there , so will know it all .  | I have spoken of all the many men-at-arms we have living here at the Llyys ; Owen has never been a warrior , truly , though long ago he did serve in the Scottish and Irish wars with King Richard . But these defenders of ours are needed now , for there are constant skirmishes between Owen 's men and the retainers of Lord Grey of Ruthin . Now this lord is English , a borderer , and has been seizing lands which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to us . Grey has also sent them over the countryside , burning and pillaging , raping our women and capturing villages . Not a day goes by but what there is not some new tale of woe or some complaint from the people hereabouts . They look to Owen for protection and also for revenge , though by Welsh law he is not their true lord . It does not work here exactly as it does in other places , like England or France . Here the people are not unfree but hold their lands by rent or purchase . In England , though , they are serfs and can own nothing , but are bound to this lord or that . I am not well versed in law of any sort , but Owen has explained it a little . Wales has had no king or ruler , really , since Prince Llewelyn lost a great battle with Edward I of England . Owen is the highest noble of the land right now , though he has not the title and actually owes allegiance to England 's king . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were granted to my father , but since the revolt and the new king , old Cess-pit Grey has grabbed a lot of them by force , and although Owen has appealed to Red Bolingbroke for justice , and a hearing in law , nothing has happened , except that Grey 's men get bolder and bolder , and are devastating the countryside . So , actually there is nothing for it but that Owen must send out men , too , to fight against Grey 's marauders . So what happens now , is that whole villages change hands ; first they are Welsh and then English , and vice versa . Only , in the meantime , innocent blood is shed , and the poor people suffer ; it is a silly situation . Owen says all wars are , even the huge ones that lay waste a whole nation ; he says this is just how wars start , small , like what is happening here . But , though Owen is a man of peace , if he can not get justice from the new king , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his protection to be butchered , or his own heirs to be beggared . Efa , who is a strange girl , finds all this exciting ; she watches for the men when they come home at nightfall and listens for the cries of their bereaved women , for always there are some who do  | not return . The rest of us are saddened , and frightened a little ; the bards sing dirges each night now at hall , and the Lady Margaret sends us girls to bring death gifts to the widows . We are suddenly in the midst of tragedy ; it is even becoming commonplace . Life here has always been so pastoral and sweet , if a little boring . I have not spoken much yet of the bards . They are Owen 's great enthusiasm , though he has many others , of course . I privately think , from the design of his house , and from these same bards , that Owen is re-creating , insofar as is possible , in his own life , the ways of ancient Greece . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own composing , on the lute and the mandol , and even the lyre , which is not a popular instrument anywhere else . Owen treats them like honored guests , giving them fine clothes and feasting them , but they are guests who never go home . I think they have no homes , in truth , but will live here always . All large manor households have visiting ministrels , jugglers , too , sometimes ; they are as common as the rain from heaven . But here they are part of our life ; I think , once they come avisiting , they just do not leave , and so there is a whole large building where they live , with a great platform in front ; in fine weather it is like a fair , one show after another . The true bards are another story ; they are , in a way , storytellers , except that they sing the stories and play the harp . There are several of those , too , but they live with the house-kin . They are all of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but there are two , I think , who must be the greatest poets in the world ( it is hard to explain ; the harp sound is as a background only , to the words , though the harp , too , can break your heart ) . One of the great ones is Griffith Lloyd , a man about ( ) wen 's age , but with no hair on his head , or even , Efa says , anywhere ( she is always spying on the men in the bathhouse ) . His skin is like a baby 's , pink and white , except for his fingertips , which are hard and brown like horn , from plucking at the strings ; his feet , too , have calloused soles an inch thick , for he goes barefoot always , like a friar . He has a huge , craggy head , like a dome , and deep eyesockets under bald shelves of brow ; his eyes look out at you as from caves they are so blue the breath catches at their beauty . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mountainside , so large and stern the features , but for those  | flower eyes . He , like Owen , has a great reputation for getting bastards , but they are not so easily spotted from a hairless father . Some of the girls think Sibli is his because she can play any instrument without even studying and has a lively imagination as well . Privately I do not think so ; she is tiny and dark as a Moor , with eyes as black as raisins . There is so much talk always about who is son or daughter of whom around here ; it is comical in a way . That is because Owen is forever adopting all the likeliest lads and girls ; he can not resist the glimmerings of intelligence wherever he finds it . He says we must stop this speculating about birth ; Owen swears that he has found in hovels , among filth , the long fingers and delicate features that are supposed to be a mark of noble blood and , conversely , among nobles the grossness and thickheadedness of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and holds with none of their common beliefs . He does not even believe in God , though I am almost afraid to write it down . ( Since I have not been struck dead , he is probably right . ) He says man has wondered always about the riddles that be in nature and the marvels that he can not understand , and so has invented gods . All men have done this , he says , time out of mind , and always will , and they are all the same gods , too , but with different names . I hope he does not say these things away from home , for they are burning people for saying much less , in England , with that old hawk , Arundel , watching ! And he is archbishop ! I hate him , too , although I have never seen him . Anyway , that bard , Griffith Lloyd , is Owen 's own bard , sometimes setting Owen 's words to music and usually composing all sorts of songs to the honor of our house . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ court , but he was not musical and wrote verses only ; his name was Master Chaucer , and Owen says he was born out of his time and is far ahead of all of us . And they say Red Bolingbroke has a fool , like the Spanish kings , always about him , to make jokes . I suppose he can not think of anything Hinny by himself . These fools , or jesters as they are called , are usually dwarfs , or born misshapen , so Richard , who loved beauty , never had one . But I remember , at the French court , t hough it was long ago , that the queen , Isabeau , had a little pet lady , no higher than a three-year-old , that she used to dress up like a doll and carry around ! All the princesses hated this little creature , for she had beautiful clothes and jewels , and they had  | none but made-over rags and one state dress between them . No wonder the first two were so happy to be married off , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bard , instead of these other kind of proteges . ( That is a French word , but I do n't know how to say it in English . ) There is another bard , too , a very old , old man ; Catherine says he is over a hundred , but she is not always sensible . At any rate , lolo Goch that is his name  --  is a very ancient man . He can no longer sing , really , for he has no teeth in his head , and his voice , too , is thin with age , but his playing would make a stone weep . He does not play often , for it wears him dreadfully , and afterward he looks like death , gray and stark . He will play tonight , in hall , Efa says ; she always knows everything that is going on  --  she is everywhere at once , that one . But something like that must be true , for the Lady Margaret has bidden all us girls to dress in our second-best gowns , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not often come to meat in our riding wear , anyhow , except for Catherine , who hates skirts . I must explain something which will sound peculiar to those in other places . All us maidens wear page 's gear when we ride among them or in sight of the men-at-arms ; Owen says it is more sensible and more seemly , too , on horseback , for our skirts blow up around our waists otherwise . Richard 's first queen , Anne of Bohemia , a lady , of course , I never saw , used to ride a sort of lady-saddle , on which she sat sidewise and not astride . They have these saddles where she came from , but they have not caught on much yet in England , and here we have none at all . I can not imagine how one would not fall off . But anyhow , there is a dreadful coil upstairs here because of this fancying-up ; Efa has accused Sibli of stealing her furred surcoat , and Sibli has scratched her face , so she will look a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is always doing such things ; most like she has left it in the pages ' house or the minstrels ' . Lady Margaret says she will not need it anyway , for the hall will he warm with all the crowd . This really makes me curious ; who is coming , besides the usual company ? Which is big enough , in fact . I think I will wear my saffron if Catherine is not wearing that color ; it is my favorite , though the velvet is rubbed a little at the elbows . I will turn it back , though , to show the lining , a nice red , and no one will notice . I wish there were time to wash my hair , but Lady Margaret says not .  | There was so much stress upstairs that I thought we would not ever get to our places at table ; besides the quarrel between Efa and Sibli , the twins Gwynneth and Gwenllian went about sobbing and sulking because the Argyllwyddes would not allow them to dress alike , which they do usually , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a kind of queer feeling in the air , as happens sometimes before a storm , although the skies were clear ; our hair crackled as it was brushed , and quick angry words rose all about . We are usually at accord here ; it was most strange . Catherine , who had planned , also , to wear her saffron , was snappish , in reverse , insisting that she would not wear the color and I must . I then said no , she must be the one to go in yellow , and so it went between us , until the Argyllwyddes reproved us for our silliness and forbade the color to either . So it turned out that I wore purple and Catherine green , by command , and , these being each our most unloved gowns , we exchanged looks of annoyance , making faces behind the Lady Margaret 's back , and giggling . In truth I would not have her job , poor lady ! But then , I never will , in all likelihood , for that I am not true-born , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Little Elliw , who never quarrels , and is always like a scared rabbit , began to cry because of all the strife about and had to be comforted by nurse like a baby . Nurse favors her and slipped her a sweetmeat , so all the rest of us clamored for one , too ; it was dreadful ! We were like a lot of bad children . And the youngest of us , even , is old enough , truly , to bear a babe , had we lived in the ancient days ! So the Lady Margaret reminded us , scolding ; she is not usually so severe , but , as I say , the very air crackled , and she , too , was perhaps affected . Finally , Efa and Sibli were forbidden hall completely and told they must eat upstairs with nurse , so after , all the rest of us were quiet and seemly , to escape the same fate . I do not feel so very sorry for those two anyway ; they will simply wait till the harping and drinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be punished all over again for it , but then Efa , in particular , would always rather be hanged for a wolf than a sheep . Nurse says she  | will come to no good end . Nurse is a very old woman ; she was serving maid to the Lady Margaret 's mother and then nurse to the lady , and now all of us ; no one can remember what her given name is ; she says one name sometimes and then another , so she probably does not even know herself ! She pretends to be very crotchety , but all us girls can get around her ; she spoils us dreadfully . She is very lewd , too , as the old women sometimes are , and the tales she tells us at bedtime , after the Argyllwyddes has gone to her chamber , have made my face flame , even in the dark . By heaven , when I give up my maidenhead , I shall be at no loss how to go about it ! To hear her tell it , one could think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Troy even ! But Efa says all old women boast like that , even the nuns at Valle Crucis . At the last minute , Catherine and I have made everyone wait while we go to the water closet ; giggling , she loosens my breastbinder , while I stuff her front , which is still small , with a silk cloth , which makes her look suddenly grown-up . When we reached hall , the whole world and his brother seemed to be in it . There were men standing in groups in the middle by the hearths and squatting in twos and threes in corners , and there were two extra trestle tables set up at the far end . The chimneys were not drawing well , and there was much blue smoke in the room ; my eyes watered , and I could not at first make out who the newcomers were , but , by my side , Catherine gave a wild cry and dashed into the midst of a group of youths , all in riding hose . I hung back a little , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not know them . All the other girls rushed after Catherine , though , and there was much hugging and kissing and cries of delight . I could not be so thickheaded as not to guess that they were her brothers , and mine , too , in fact , so I stretched my neck to pick out Meredith . I found him soon , for he stood a little apart , with two others . Even from where I stood I could see that the whole mort of them were dusty as scarecrows ; they must have just that moment ridden in . I greeted Meredith with the kiss of welcome , and he returned it , on both cheeks , in the French manner , calling me belle soeur , in compliment to my court days . One of his companions was a dark youth , like a gypsy , with a beaky nose , and a look of gawky pride ; he was called a cousin , but some removed , of ( ) wen 's , half-Norman , Rhisiart by name . I was not sure yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man of  | great self-possession , with a round , smooth countenance , and a smile of extraordinary sweetness ; I did not catch his name , for introductions flowed all around me by then , all my new-met brothers speaking at once . They had , all of them , that elusive look of Owen that he stamps on all his get , though they were all unlike , really , except for size . Big young men they were , all , of shades of fairness from flaxen to brown . I felt I must wait to sort out all their names . They were just come from Oxford , as we had expected , with others , too , almost they would make an army among them . Which explained why the hall was so crowded . It was warm , too , with the breath of so many heating up the air , and all the fires going . One of the fireplaces smoked still , though some of the serving men were trying to wave the smoke back and up the flue where it belonged . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; out flew an edge of the silk stuffing from her bosom . The dark Rhisiart stared , Catherine blushed and fumbled , and I saw the Argyllwyddes frown . Oh-oh , I thought , we are in for it now ; she will notice my front , too . But Owen himself came up then , to embrace his sons and make all welcome , and so a diversion was created , thank the Holy Mother . I was much surprised to hear Owen 's words to the young round-face . " A hearty welcome , sir , " he said . " And great congratulations to you . It is not often we are honored by such a celebrity " ? who could he be , I wondered , listening for Owen 's next words " to confound Arundel and all his inquisitors no mean feat . I shall expect you in the Saracen Room tonight . . . come with Meredith , after all this . . . " and Owen waved his hand at the company . He brought forward the Lady Margaret . " My dear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too , and lately of Hereford . . . ? My Lady wife , sir . . . . " I saw Lady Margaret 's neck begin to come out in red blotches , a thing that never happened except when she was angered . " I am honored , sir , " she said , holding out her hand . " It is good to know that cruel upstart Arundel thwarted for once . . . . I should like to see him beaten to his knees and stripped of all his powers . . . . " Her voice rose as I had never heard it , and I stood , amazed . Owen smiled , patting her arm . " Women are ever the most bloodthirsty . . . . My Lady is more Lollard than any in these  | parts  --  even , it might be , than you , yourself , sir . . . . " And then it all came together in my mind , making sense , and I knew the name . For even here , so far away , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same Walter Brut , and how he was acquitted , by virtue of his clerkly knowledge and his nimble tongue . He was the only accused Lollard yet to escape the stake . And here he was ! I looked at him again , marveling . He had , in truth , such an open , frank manner , so harmless a look . . . I shuddered again to think of the flames . . . . For the last thirty or forty years , maybe before , there have been Lollards all through the isles of Britain , particularly in England , where Master Wycliffe preached and taught . I do not know precisely how to define the term Lollard ; Owen says it is from old Saxon and means " tares , " another archaic word , which means " seeds , " so it has come to mean in truly orthodox clergy 's minds , " dangerous weeds sown by the devil . " This is Owen 's explanation , not mine ; I personally think a Lollard is just sort of anyone who thinks for himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Englishing of the Bible , so that the poor and uneducated , who need the word of God , can get it without going to the priests , who might have their own reasons for withholding certain passages . Then , too , they do not believe that the consecrated wafer and wine do actually become the body and blood of Christ , but is a spiritualization only . And other things , too , all kinds of dissension , in fact . King Richard was half a Lollard himself , and the new king 's father , John of Gaunt , was a supporter of Master Wycliffe , and even granted him monies for the finishing of the English Bible , but Red Bolingbroke is somehow thick as thieves with Archbishop Arundel , who is now his chancellor , and there is dreadful persecution in England now , and the Lollards preach in secret or not at all . The new archbishop has even obtained an edict from the Pope to support it ! It is named De Heretico Comburendo , and , of course , means , Concerning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which used to be just a sign of reason , is now considered heresy , and those found guilty may be burned alive ! People say that one out of every three persons in England is Lollard , so it can turn into a holocaust , Owen says . The universities at Oxford are seething with dissent ; they are all Lollards and rebels , even , there . Great numbers of them have been flocking into Wales for the past two years ; there are teach- ers in all the taverns and preaching at every hedge-corner . The worst of it is , says Owen , that old Red Bolingbroke does not even do this persecuting because he believes in orthodoxy or is pious , but for reasons of policy only . He is pushing for the support of the clergy and the established wealthy , who , of course , do not want to see any changes . I heard Owen say to Master Brut , " Forgive me if I put you just below the dais . . . . There are two gentleman of the clergy present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I fear you might be uncomfortable in their presence . . . . " And the Lollard answered that he liked nothing better than to sit among the lowly , for , after all , did not our Saviour love them best . . . . Owen laughed loud then , putting his arm about the man , and saying , " It is easy to see how you confounded your questioners , sir . . . but you will not have such very lowly company as all that , for I have placed our new cousin , Rhisiart , next you , and his young Oxford friends . . . . " I looked carefully at this Master Brut and decided that he had the face of a homely angel , if there might be such a thing . Certainly the contrast between this man and our " clergy " guests is remarkable . Father Domitius has the face of a satyr , dark and evil , with red , moist lips , and eyes that strip the serving maids of their bodices . I have seen him pinch them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no one sees . The other , Father Simon , is a Cistercian , and a mild little man , but fat as a pig from rich pastries , and with grease stains all over his habit . Not all the clergy are like them , of course ; there are some saints , even among them , but it is fellows like these that give the orders their bad names . The Argyllwyddes came among us then and herded all us maidens like sheep to our places . We sit apart from the men and pour our own wine ; it is as if she thought we might be seduced by the pages as they passed the pitchers ! I find that I call her the Lady Margaret when I like her , and the Argyllwyddes when she annoys me , for it is , indeed , a foolish-sounding title . She is a good lady , though , and kind , mostly ; it is true that the men get drunken quickly , and there are fights often . And so we sat , all panting and bright-eyed with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and giggling among ourselves . Catherine whispered to me that she has never yet seen a young man to please her so much as our new cousin .  | She thinks he looks like Roland , in the song . I have said she is romantic . He watched her , too , whenever she turned away ; when their glances meet it will be a lightning bolt . Catherine looked very pretty ; we had earlier darkened her fair eyebrows with chimney-soot  --  they are her only flaw . There are darkening dyes to be had somewhere , but we have not been able to get hold of any around here , though we all rub beet juice on our cheeks when it is in season . I had brought back all kinds of paints and perfumes from Richard 's court , but they have run out long ago , with all of us using them , and the Argyllwyddes will not let us buy any from the peddlers . It is not fair , really ; she uses something herself on her hair . It is too bright , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the roots . I suppose she is right , and we do not need such things , but they are fun to play with on a dull day , after lessons . At least , though , we were unattended by nurse , or any other , and were also raised on a little dais of our own , so we could watch everything with ease , and not have to eat dishes we disliked or water our wine down to nothing . I , in fact , could eat no food at all ; I was far too excited . I kept watching Meredith , who fascinated me . He had a sad face , old for his years , but fineboned , and with a kind of shine upon it ; there is a little hook to his nose , and his mouth is too large ; otherwise he would be as woman-pretty as poor Richard . He looked at me too , his lips curving , often and often , and I felt he saw me as fair . What a pity he is my half-brother ; I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fall in love with a cousin only ! Of course , we have all read of those ancient peoples of Egypt and Crete who were ruled by brother and sister espoused in their cradles . But those days are gone forever , and even distant kinships are frowned upon in unions . Owen says it is best , for close marriages thin the blood-stock after a time , as in cattle , and make idiots , or worse . The speeches began , but we listened with half an ear ; they are dull and rambling as a rule . Besides , Catherine , who can not spell , was trying to compose a note to that eagle-nosed Rhisiart , and she had all the words down wrong , and I had to help her . We are allowed visitors in our solar upstairs by day , and she wanted to make sure of his company tomorrow . For sure , he will come anyway ; all the young men will come  --  it is a courtesy . The voices from the dais rose and fell , rose and fell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the main , in Welsh , and about Welsh freedom and English oppression ; Owen sat like a statue ? he has these fits sometimes of seeming to be somewhere else , his eye looking through at some other thing . They do not last long but are frightening somehow . Beside him is the Argyllwyddes , in a robe made of little white skins of ermine , with sleeves of gold cloth . She is stout , and I wager she is sweating under it all , while Owen wears a thin linen tunic , with bare legs . On Owen 's other side is his oldest son , Griffith , whom I never had before seen . He is unlike Meredith or any of the others , much stockier of build , and with a face that looks like a clerk 's , small and tight . Catherine , who had abandoned her writing , nudged me and began to giggle . " Look at that great booby , " she said . " He is wearing the belt of Eliseg  --  around his neck ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Owen 's brow , is a hereditary honor to the wearer . It is the oldest son 's privilege to wear it ; I suppose the Argyllwyddes made Griffith do it , to please Owen , on this night , with all his sons around him . I whispered to Catherine that maybe our brother thought it was a gorget , for the neck , and she whispered back that it would not probably fit around his waist , as he takes after their mother , a thing I would not dare to say . We began to giggle helplessly then , and the Argyllwyddes , who misses little , began to frown ; even Owen turned his head slowly in our direction , like a sleepwalker . Oh-oh , I thought , here we go up to our chamber in disgrace , but choking with laughter all the same , when there came a horrible commotion from the courtyard , where the peasant folk had assembled to hear the bard . They were shouting loud , the deep notes of men gruff and wild , and rising above it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hall were flung open and a great group of soldiers burst in , dragging someone across the flags . I heard , " An Englishman . . . A spy . . . a Ruthin spy ! " We all stood up , but we could see nothing . It was like a pack of dogs worrying a fox . I saw Meredith run up to the dais and take his father by the shoulder . Owen shook himself a little and rose , holding up a hand . " Silence ! " he cried . " Stand back ! " The soldier crowd flowed backwards , tripping in their haste , leaving a circle where a man knelt , gripping another by the throat . " Mother of God , " whispered Catherine . " It is Rhys the Sav-age ! "  | I had never seen either of them before . The man she called Savage was indeed the wildest-looking creature in the world ; one might even believe he belonged to that old race that is said to have occupied the earth before man . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ animal around his middle , and was naked above but hairy . Hair grew down , too , low on his forehead and down his backbone ; his mouth jutted forward , the teeth showing like fangs . He knelt over the other , a knife in hand . From where we stood , we could see the man was bound and helpless , blood running already down his face ; he was dressed in the jerkin and hose of an English archer . Voices rose all around , and from the yard the women loudest of all . " Kill him ! Kill the English pig ! To the fire with him ! " The company sat or stood , frozen , like a scene in a masque , Owen with his hand still upraised . On a sudden , Walter Brut , the Lollard , broke from his place at table and ran to the men on the floor . " My Lord Owen , " he cried , ringingly , " this man has an immortal soul ! He must be heard ! " Rhys the Savage gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word , and raised his knife . The voices rose again . " He will not speak ! Throw him into the fire ! " Owen 's voice thundered where he stood . " Rhys Gethin ! Hold ! " And he spoke other words , in Welsh , too fast for my understanding . " Speak , man ! Where are you from ? " " Speak , speak ! " howled the mob , inside and out the hall . The bound man , loosed by the Savage for a second , struggled a little ways up from the floor . I saw his face clearly , white as chalk , with runnels of blood upon it . " God save King Harry ! " cried the Englishman . " God save Lancaster and to hell with . . . . " but his words ended in a long-drawn death cry , for Rhys the Savage did not hold his hand . There was a hush of horror upon the hall ; then , over the whole assembled crowd came shriek after shriek in a woman 's voice , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and went on and on , piteous and wild , until it stopped suddenly , in the middle of a wail , as if sliced by a sword . Again there was silence . Quiet , cool , like drops of rain , fell Owen 's words , as he faced the killer . " You shall answer to this blood , Rhys Gethin . In court of law , beast that you are , you shall answer . . . . " He made a  | sign with his hand to the soldiery . " Bind him . . . and take him away . " His voice sounded weary , with the weariness , I thought , for I am fanciful , of an old and sickened god . As they dragged the brutish creature from the hall ; he broke from his captors and ran toward Owen . Oh , my God , I thought , Owen is lost , for he carries no weapon . But this Rhys Gethin flung himself at his feet , grabbing at the hem of Owen 's tunic and kissing it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " he said in a broken sort of Welsh . " Do what you will with me , Prince . . . but save Wales only ! " " Save Wales ! Save Wales ! " rang through the hall , from a hundred voices . " Hail Owen , Prince of Powys ! Hail Owen , the rightful Prince of Wales ! Saint Derfel for Owen and the Red Dragon ! Owen and Wales ! Owen and Wales forever ! " Owen looked long on the figure at his feet , slobbering at his gown . He stood for a long moment , still as a stone ; then , stooping , he raised him up , kissing the filthy creature on his matted head . " My son , my son . . . poor animal . . . poor , poor creature of God . . . . " And the tears stood in Prince Owen 's eyes , glittering in the flickering firelight . " Go to your prison , my poor son . . . bear him kindly . . . . " And he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away . All was confusion in hall . Owen sank down onto his seat on the dais , his head in his hands . The Lady Margaret left his side and , quickly , for all her great size , went to the end of table , where the bard , Griffith Lloyd , sat , whispering in his ear . I saw the other Griffith , the belt of Eliseg still hanging askew about his neck , standing foolishly by his father , struck dumb . The Lollard knelt beside the dead Englishman ; he had torn his fine gown into strips to wipe the face clean of blood and hide the gaping wound in the throat . I saw him take , then , the small cross he wore at his belt and place it between the dead man 's hands , crossed now on his breast . There was a goblet of wine overturned on the floor , and blood and wine mingled , reddening the strewn rushes of the hearth and staining the remnants of Sir Walter 's gown . It was a scene of antique horror @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words within me like a doom .  | There was harp-playing all that sad evening , but it was the bard Griffith Lloyd , and not the ancient Iolo Goch , who would not leave his chamber after the violence below stairs . We were all herded to our quarters , too ; little Elliw had fainted clean away , and Meredith carried her up the stairs , handing her to nurse , who cuddled her as if she were a baby ; I think , though , that she was already come around in Meredith 's arms , for I saw a little gleam under her eyelids and a flickering , too . It must be pleasant to be carried so ; I fear , alas , it will never be my fate , though , unless the man be a giant , which Meredith is not . We could hear the harping from the hall , haunting and wild ; old dirges , and one new one that the bard improvised , more beautiful than all the rest . We could hear only scattered words though there was so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our brother , came to us soon , to tell the news . He is the Lady Margaret 's favorite , one can tell , for we can seldom welcome young men when the lamps are lit . He said that Owen had forbidden any war songs and was trying to clear the hall gradually . Already the great doors had been closed , and men sent to disperse the folk in the courtyard . Efa was furious that she had missed all the excitement and made us all sick with her blood-greed ; how old was the Englishman , where was he wounded and in which parts , how far did the blood spurt , how far did the knife go in , and so on . Elliw turned quite green and had to be put to bed , shut away behind her curtains and with her canopy over . It is difficult to fathom Efa ; Catherine says she is fey ; privately I think it is worse than that . Why should there not be minds that are ill , as bodies are ? It is a strange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not like her . She is the only one of the maidens I have no feeling for ; even Sibli , who is forever trying to fondle me , does not really annoy . One just must avoid her embraces , that is all . Griffith , I said , looked like a clerk ; he speaks like one , too , long-winded and precise . Meredith had to remind him that he  | was expected to join Owen , with some of the other young men , in the Saracen Room . ( This is simply a large chamber furnished with Eastern treasures , costly carpets , and beautiful , rare wall hangings . ) We have never been there , we girls , for some of the hangings portray scenes which the Argyllwyddes considers too lively for our maidenly senses . Naturally , we have imagined all sorts of things , obscenities , even , but Iago , one of the nicer of the pages , says it is simply a lot of naked women lying about seductively . So that , I conceive , it is much like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in an old sea chest . We both of us thought the women were too fat . Griffith told us that the two holy fathers , who were at hall , have left in a huff because Owen allowed the Englishman 's body to be put into our private chapel ; they argued that he was a Lancaster dog and should be thrown on the dung heap . Owen did not answer , but gave them escort for the ride back to the cloister . He has made two more enemies , I guess ; some of the clergy call Owen a heathen already , though many and many a night they fill their bellies at his table . I wish , myself , that they would go over to the English ; they are cut of the same cloth as old flamecrazy Arundel , anyway . The hall was emptied slowly , and the last strains of the harping died on the air . We were all in our shifts and locked in for the night ; Catherine and I shared a bed we were waiting to hear nurse snore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scratch at the door , and then another , and we heard nurse grumble and the clink of keys . There was no moon , but the ceiling was open to the sky , and by the light of the stars we could see that the serving maids were bringing something in , something like a body , long and still . Catherine and I sat up , and all over the chamber we could hear rustlings ; no one was asleep . After the maids came the Lady Margaret , with a candle ; in its light we saw her fingers pressed to her lips . " Sh-h-h . . . " she whispered . " It is a very sick woman . . . . " Sick , indeed , she looked , in the flickering light ; I would almost have thought her dead . The twins rose quickly and got other candles to light from the lady 's , and Catherine and I fetched the great rushlight from the mantel . All the maidens were up now , except Elliw , and she was peeping from between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from one of the serving girls and sponged off the blood from the face ; they had laid her on my bed , which was the only one empty , I having been in Catherine 's . I saw with a certain squeamishness that she was a very dirty wench , besides soaking blood into my coverings . I pushed the thought away , for it was not that of a gentlewoman , and held the light for the Lady Margaret . The woman  --  she was really not a great deal older than we , twenty , perhaps had several gashes on her forehead , and a great wound in her arm ; blood kept flowing from it , though the lady had wadded cotton against it . Her clothes were all filthy and mostly torn away ; she looked as though wild dogs had been at her . There was , too , a huge bruise already purpling on one cheek , under her eye . The lady turned to the serving maid , making a gesture . " Quick  --  fetch the Israel-ite ! " " I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is . . . he 's with Owen in the Saracen Room . . . . " And she darted out between the serving women , before anyone could stop her , running down the hall in her shift . I saw the lady bite her lips and frown ; Efa would pay for this . It crossed my mind that maybe the lady might even send her away , with all the young men home ; though she has spent most of her days here , Efa is as wild as a fox-bitch from the forest . I stopped thinking about her though , for the girl on the bed began moaning and moving her head from side to side . Her hair , if it had been washed , was pale as flax , long and very straight . It was hard to tell what her face might look like  --  it was so beaten and swollen but her body was very fair , with firm , rounded limbs , and white skin . She was sturdier of build than any of us maidens here but still comely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slapping the flags , quick and loud in the quiet house , and behind her the dragging limp of ' the Israelite . When she slipped in through the door , I saw her face was flushed and near to laughter , her reddish curls all tumbled about her face . Her shift had slipped off one shoulder , too , exposing a breast ; oh-oh , I thought , glancing at the Argyllwyddes . But she had not seen and had risen to speak to the physician . He was just coming down the corridor , Nathan ben Arran , Owen 's friend and doctor . Owen had brought him back from one of his Eastern trips long ago ; no one can remember when he was not here in the household . I think that no one yet ,  | under his care , has ever died ; he has great skill , far beyond any of our own people . Catherine and I take lessons from him , too , for we are the cleverest in such things , but we do not study doctoring but just some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a lame man , and bent his head to the girl 's heart . Then he straightened up and rummaged in his big box , which Iago , the page , had brought , taking out a wound-up length of cloth . This he bound tightly , very tightly , about the girl 's arm , a few inches above the bleeding gash . He explained as he worked . " This is to stop the flow of blood . . . her heartbeat is strong but very rapid . . . . " And he handed Catherine a twist of paper , telling her to empty the powder in it into a little wine . When he put the doctored wine to the girl 's lips , she made a face , though her eyes were closed still ; the stuff must have been bitter . He tipped her head back , forcing the potion down . " She will sleep now , " he said . " It is poppy juice . . . in a little while she will feel nothing , and I can get to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it gently ; she gave a little moan . " Not yet . . . who is the maid ? I have not seen her before . . . . " Catherine and I spoke at once , saying that we did not know , that no one knew . The Lady Margaret stopped us , saying , " They found her in the courtyard , after the people had been driven away . . . the women had beaten her and cut her with knives . . . we think she is from the castle at Ruthin . . . . " " I think she is the woman of that young Englishman " said Efa , in her important little way ; she was not even in hall but still she knows everything . Perhaps she is a witch . As a matter of fact , this proved to be the case , not Efa being a witch , of course , but the girl being the lover of the dead Englishman . We found all this out later , when she came around and could talk ; it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after Rhys the Savage had used his dagger . The girl ( she said she believed she was about eighteen , though she looked somewhat older ) was from the castle at Ruthin , as we had thought . Her name was Alice , and she had the surname Oxerd , in the English fashion , according to the occupation of the family . So this meant that she was a byremaid , or cattle girl , someone who worked in the stables . This was why she was so dirty , aside from the women having thrown her to the ground .  | Anyway , Alice had followed her man here to Glendower House ; he had been sent to spy , and she feared for him . When she cried out at his death , the women knew that she was English , too , and beat her cruelly , kicking and slashing at her with knives . The men-at-arms had finally dragged them off her , but she looked dead to them , and if the Lollard , Master Brut , had not intervened , she would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We did not find this out all at once but in pieces only ; Alice wept continually as soon as she woke from the poppy drug . She was in dread of all of us , too , and screamed if any came near her ; Nathan , the doctor , said she was in a state of shock and remembered nothing . Master Brut said she had miscarried of a babe , too ; it looked to have been about six months inside her . He buried it just outside our burying ground ; the priests would not allow it in hallowed ground , for that it was English and not shriven either , never having lived . Master Brut says there is nothing in the Scriptures that condemns a babe unborn to the flames of hell , or to limbo either , which is what some of the orders believe . He says all creatures , when they die , rest in the lap of the Saviour , even felons and madmen , even murderers , even the louse cracked between our fingers , and not humans only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Master Brut is very religious . We held the funeral services for the dead Englishman , burying him beside the babe . There was no priest who would officiate , so Nathan , the Israelite , read some Hebrew words over him , and Master Brut some Latin . Owen translated into Welsh , and both of the eulogies were very beautiful , especially the Hebrew , which was by an ancient king and poet named David , which is a Welsh name , also , strangely enough ; it had to do with green pastures and valleys and the infinite comfort of God . It made me think of our land here , Wales , which we mostly call Cymry , and Catherine and I both wept . The Ruthin girl was still not well and did not attend . She mended slowly , poor thing , her face turning all the shades of the rainbow before it finally looked human again . She is not ill-favored , but I fancy there is a sly , unpleasant look about her ; the Lady Margaret says she has been badly used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stories she tells are true at all , I can not blame her . She says that she was ravished over and over  | again by both the Lord Grey and his son , on her wedding night , so that when her husband had his turn she was near to dead from the rapings , and they could not bed for a week . It is hard to credit , but the Greys are known in these parts for their wickedness , and besides , such things are said to be an English custom , brought over by the Normans . They burned her mother , also , Alice said , for a witch . The strange thing is that Alice said she was a witch and could work evil . She herself boasted that she has learned much of it , too ; Efa is with her a lot , whispering , for she is very curious about such things . Alice is very ignorant , of course , and can not read or write ; as she recovers , the Lady Margaret is having lessons given to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the moment , but she does well , for a person who has never done anything except tend cattle . The Lollard has asked permission to visit her and read from the Scriptures ; he says it will comfort her for the loss of her man , and the babe , too . She was horrible about the babe and said she did not care if it burned ; she did not know whose it was anyway , on account of the things done to her by the Grey men . Master Walter spoke gently to her but said such thoughts were wrong , for all creatures have the right alike to immortality . She has come to look forward to his visits , preening herself , and listening to him in all meekness , and she does not with anyone else . Owen says that the teachings of Jesus have always gone down best with the very poor and the ignorant ; that is how , he says , the whole religion started , among the slave population of Rome . Also , he says , it appealed to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in Gaul , and other places , long ago , and so has spread over half the world . But Owen says that so much evil has been wrought over this religion , just like the burnings that are happening today , which are all on account of some small point of doctrine . He says to look at all the holy wars , the Crusades in Jerusalem , and the devastation there which went on for centuries and is even now going on , in a smaller way . Just two centuries ago a whole nation was wiped out and they were Christians themselves by other Christians ! He means the Albigensians , who had the Cathar religion , just differing a little from the established church , and they were all burned , by the hundreds !  | I asked him if that had not been so , too , with the old pagans , and he said it was lost in the mists of time , but that he did not think so ; they were all much alike , he said , with simple gods drawn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ argue about . Evil has certainly been done , I see that , but the Lollard , for instance , is a true believer in Jesus , and one can see that he is not in any way evil but almost , I think , a saint . Owen says there are many such but doubts that they can weigh very heavily in the scales against the prevailing horror . Owen , though he says these things , is not a pagan either , as many people imagine , but a thinker only . I once heard poor King Richard say that Owen was a man ahead of his times . I believe that Owen would be ahead of whatever times he lived in ; that is the kind of man he is . It is true , though , that religion is the cause of much strife ; even here in the castle there are arguments and shoutings among all the young men , particularly those who have come from Oxford . They are mostly Lollard , but even among themselves they disagree ; they will talk a point until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once , oh , centuries ago , in Paris , where the greatest minds of that time studied , scholars argued for weeks and months over how many angels might dance upon the head of a pin ! It is hard to credit , but some of these discussions around here are just as silly . And all over nothing , as I privately think , for I can not help agreeing with Owen . I do not voice this though , for even though women are given much freedom in Wales , no one would allow us to speak of doctrine . There is a woman in France , Christine de Pisan , who is much respected as a poet thinker , but she is a very orthodox believer and almost a mystic ; I have read her works and do not count them as very much . It is like applauding a dog who has learned to walk on his hind legs or a bird whose clipped tongue can imitate speech . Many of the young Oxford men are extremely rebellious to the new king , spitting and cursing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are fiercely Welsh , and are all for war with England . There are a few commoners among them , too , those who studied under Owen 's grants , and they want to bring about another peasants ' revolt . There is unrest all about , that is certain , but this castle is a hotbed of seething ideas . Owen does not speak but listens merely , showing courtesy to all .  | Every day the young men visit in the maidens ' quarters , or we ride abroad together , if it is fine , and there have been no skirmishes roundabout ; indeed , since the slaying of the Ruthin spy , there has been little fighting and no reprisals from Lord Grey . I had expected it to be the other way around . The Lady Margaret fears that it is but a calm before the storm . In the meantime , though , we are enjoying ourselves greatly , for it is nearly summer , and green everywhere , with all the little flowers abloom upon the hillsides , and the winding streams leaping down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but there is some pairing off . The twins , Gwynneth and Gwenllian , have found themselves two brothers , imagine it big , laughing boys from Ireland , with flame-red hair cropped around their ears in the new fashion . They are spoiling for a fight , and there is not enough going on in their own country , so they have come to offer their swords to Owen and Wales . I could see Owen 's lip twitch as he heard them swear fealty , but he spoke gravely to them and thanked them most kindly . Many of the young men have their hair cut in this way ; it is a fad started by Harry Percy , he they call Hotspur ; he is the biggest hero in all England , and even though he is allied with their enemy of Lancaster , even the dissenters copy him . In fact , they mostly refuse to believe that he will stay pro-Lancaster , but will come over in time to Owen . I privately do not care very much for the look of this hairstyle ; it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and scissors cut around the pot edges . Below , all is shaven , just the opposite of the monks ' tonsure . They call it the helm cut , to fit under a helmet easily ; you can see they are all afire to go to war ! Owen , I think , still hopes to avoid it ; the talk is that he has sent peace envoys even to Bolingbroke , but as yet there has been no answer . Meanwhile , he sits at hall like a broody eagle , at the high seat , listening but not speaking often . As I have said , there is some pairing off between us young folk ; besides the twins , Catherine has got her Rhisiart , and they go about hand-in-hand when the lady is not watching . No good can come of it , of course , for he is not noble , and she is the only legitimate daughter of the highest prince of the land . Owen has other daughters by the Argyllwyddes , four of them , but they are much  | older , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off in high places ; I have never met them  --  they are scattered all over Wales . Walter Brut spends most of his time with Alice , the Ruthin girl ; he is teaching her his Scriptures , and she has almost lost her sullen look . Indeed , now that she is clean and in seemly dress , she is very fair , in a large , white , Saxon way . She does not ride with us though or go outside the castle ; the lady is afraid the sight of her will provoke more battles with the Ruthin people . So they two , Alice and the Lollard , sit in corners , talking in whispers of the Bible , and cuddling , too , I suspect . Alice is not a wanton , like Efa , but I have seen the look in her eyes as she gazes at Walter , a look of hunger , truly ; it can not all be greed for knowledge ! As for myself , there are none to my taste here , though I like all my newfound brothers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I know all the names now , of course ; there is David , and Rhys , Tudor , and Evan . They are all for a great war for Wales , and all wear the helm cut , but they are gentle under , one can see . They talk of battles with eyes that are friendly as hounds ! Meredith is still my favorite ; we are much alike , I think , and can talk of anything . He has told me all sorts of tales about Harry , the king 's son , for he was at Oxford , too , Harry . Most people call him Hal , says Meredith , and he is much liked , even by those who hate his father well . They studied together , Meredith and Hal , under the famous master of law , Sir John Oldcastle , and much admire this man . This amazes me , for Oldcastle is the most famous Lollard in the whole realm , and Hal 's father so orthodox . But Meredith says that Hal does not agree well with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though he , Hal , is not a Lollard either . The strangest thing is that Hal has a name for tumbling all the wenches in the countryside he can not be turned fourteen ! Meredith says I must not call him little Harry anymore , for he has grown to be a half head taller than Meredith himself , and I have myself to raise my eyes a little to Meredith . This gives me pleasure to think on , silly though it is , when we are almost enemies now , Hal and I , on account of our fathers . Even so , when I think of Hal sporting with all those girls , I feel the blood mount to my face and have to turn my head away so that my brothers will not see . It is most strange .  | I can never forget the night of Iolo Goch 's death , for in a way it marked the true start of the war ; also it happened on Midsummer Eve , when all the fires were lit all over Wales . The two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been skirmishes before , and scattered fighting in our northern parts , between Grey 's men and ours , but Owen thought for a long time to avoid a fullscale conflict . This was not to be . I have said the bard was very ancient ; he had been around so long indeed that one began to think of him as more than mortal . Even Owen , I believe , did not realize that he was dying . He had been ailing since the night in early spring when the Ruthin spy had been murdered ; Nathan ben Arran ministered to him daily , but even he could not save him  --  his days were running out . He lived among the house kin , Iolo Goch , for he was Owen 's great friend . There was no harping in the hall , even on guest nights , for the music disturbed him strangely ; Griffith Lloyd 's great harp hung on the wall behind him where he sat at meat , and every night he waxed the strings and polished the wood , for it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had lit our own fire that Midsummer Eve , on the mound outside the walls . It is an ancient custom , from long before the Christian days , this lighting of the Midsummer fires ; no one can remember exactly what it means . It celebrates the summer and the yield of the earth , I suppose ; Owen says , again , it probably started with sacrifices to propitiate the Mother Goddess , and so is even older than Britain itself . They do not do this firing in England much nowadays , but Wales is full , still , of the old traditions , and ridden with superstition . Our fire was burning true , the flames leaping into the air as soon as the late sun went down . We had all come out to watch , the house folk and all the soldiery and company . It is a fine sight , a bonfire , especially when you know that no one suffers in the flames . ( Perhaps that is why they do not observe the custom anymore in English towns . ) The fire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mound , so that it could be seen for miles around . This mound is not just a hill , but something made by men , long ago . Owen says there are many of them all over Wales ; they date from Druidic times , or before , and are thought to be burying places of the Old People . The Great Mound at Mathrafal was struck by lightning , years ago , when Owen was a boy ; the whole hill was split asunder , and bones were strewn all about . Owen went to see  --  even then he was as curious as a cat ; he says the bones were small as children 's and bent in a posture like the child inside the womb . It was a thought that made me shudder , for I could not help thinking of child sacrifice , but Owen says no , the Old People were a smaller race than we are , that is all . The heads of arrows were found , too , at Mathrafal , and broken pieces of pottery , and even jewels , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believed in an afterlife , too , and buried their possessions with them for use in the other world . Owen says often that when he has time he will dig up our mound here , and study what he finds ; it is a pity he does not have nine lives , like a cat , also ! Our fire burned bravely , and we watched for a while , as people will , drawn by the flames ' patterns . We young folk stood on the wall , holding one another for balance , and looked at the horizon for the other fires . One by one , roundabout , they sprang up , far away ; we counted nine in all before we went back to hall . It is a lovely moment , that time of the first lighting of the fires of Midsummer ; something full and rare about it  --  the heart seems to burst with rapture , and laughter bubbles in the throat . This was all shattered , though , when we went back indoors , for a strange hush had fallen there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a corner , fighting over a bit of meat on the floor . Someone shooed them out , and we could hear a strange whistling sound . There was a little knot of people at one end of the hall , bending over something . As we drew near , we saw it was a litter set clown on the ground . The bard , Iola ( loch lay on it , his wasted body barely raising the coverings . The whistling sounds were coming from him , as he labored to speak . Owen bent over him like a son , trying to understand , his face drawn in concern and pity . The old man heaved himself up on his elbows with a mighty effort , straining the muscles in his throat , his eyes staring wildly . He was so tiny and withered , he might himself have been one of the Old People of the  | mounds . His head seemed no bigger than a fist ; it was crowned with a nimbus of white ringlets , soft as cotton . On his upper lip there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hairs of it were bright red , like copper . Once the hair of his head had been red , too ; it was how he had come by his name , Iolo the Red . We girls had always thought he dyed the hairs of his upper lip , but it could not be , now , on his day of dying . Those thin red hairs , gleaming in the firelight , seemed to draw into them all the life that was left in him , but for the staring eyes and the reedy whistle that came out of his throat . It was plain that he was trying to speak , but no one could hear his words under the desperate gusty breaths that came out of him . All over the hall the people crept close soldiers , archers , servants , guests , and pages  --  all crowding around the dying man . Many fell to their knees . There was the soft sound of women weeping and the harsher sound of the soldiers sobbing ; he was the most beloved figure in these parts . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head close to the old bard 's lips . There was a look of awful strain on his face as he tried to understand the sighing , bubbling breaths , and a terrible flashing of angry impatience in Iolo 's eyes ; over all there was , always , that dreadful , high whistling , louder now . Walter Brut was at Owen 's side , holding a plain wooden cross ; the bard pushed it away angrily ; he was a true heathen , proud and contemptuous , and blasphemous , too , in his time . Walter said to Owen , " Perhaps , sir , the other bard might understand him . . . ? " Owen signed to Griffith Lloyd , who pushed through the crowd and fell to his knees beside the litter ; the big man , bald as a mountain , bent his huge head to kiss one of the knotty , wisened hands of the dying poet ; then he , too , brought his ear close to the old lips . He listened long , while the whole company fell quiet . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the series of sounds were meaningless , the whistle shrilling now in a heartrending way . Finally Griffith Lloyd straightened up , shaking his head . The poet on the litter made a sign then , gesturing the people back ; there was a listening look on his face . As the crowd fell back , I heard someone whisper , " He is calling on Derfel ! " I heard , too , Walter 's reproving words , " He is praying . . . . " The bard did not seem to hear anything about him ; as I said , he  | looked to be listening to some sound within himself . I saw that Owen stood very still beside him , with big , unnoticed tears running down his face . As we watched , lolo Goch seemed to relax suddenly , his passionate tension dropping away . He sank back , and Owen knelt to support him . The bard accepted his support with a faint nod , and even something like a smile . For a long moment he lay there , in Owen 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I heard the Lollard murmur softly . I , too , thought the end had come , but the terrible whistling sound continued and the eyes still stared . Suddenly , he made a slight movement , looking , as I thought , toward me . But Elliw , beside me , started forward . I remembered that she was the poet 's kinswoman , on her dead mother 's side , and that she had been raised to the sound of his voice from infancy . He must have been , I thought , trying to get it straight , her great-great-uncle . She , too , bent over the old man , her slight figure bearing him up , taking Owen 's place . I remember she wore white ; her cloudy brown hair was tied back with a ribbon and fell loosely to her waist . I heard her voice , small but clear . " What do you say , Uncle Iolo ? Say it again , slower ! Whisper it  --  whisper it , Uncle lolo . . . I can hear you . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his lips . Owen raised his hand for silence , but there was no need . The entire hall was silent as death . It was easy to see that this was the great poet 's last chance to be understood . We all held our breaths , waiting . And she did understand him , though how she did it was a mystery . It was , I thought afterward , her instinct in making him whisper , perhaps . I was astonished at Elliw 's calm ; she had always been such a timorous thing , as jumpy as a deer or a rabbit . But this night she sat straight and listened and repeated clearly , in a voice that did n't even tremble , all his whispered words . I heard a little page somewhere behind me struggling not to cough , and there was a muffled sneeze from the end of the hall , but except for that every word Elliw said fell like a smooth stone into the silence . " He says he willed someone to come , " she said . " Me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says you must all swear on the belt of Eliseg to be Owen 's men against the English . He says September the " she paused then , and we could see her bend lower , frown- ing in concentration , trying to catch the word ? " September the fifteenth  --  no , the sixteenth  --  the sixteenth . . . you must all come here and proclaim Owen the Prince of Wales . . . . He says on Saint Matthew 's Day we must ? " She broke off . We could see that the old poet , light as he was , had become too heavy for her as his body slumped against her . Then in almost a cry she repeated the single word , " Ruthin , " and sank sideways beneath his weight . That word , " Ruthin , " the name of Grey 's stronghold , must have been the last word uttered on earth by Iolo , for he never stirred again , and his staring eyes looked now at the ceiling . Meredith ran forward and gathered up Elliw in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left , carrying her , we could see that the front of her white gown was all marked with Iolo 's blood , where it had gushed from his mouth as he died . I saw the Lady Margaret speak to Alice , and the girl followed the two to our upstairs chamber . Even in the shock and turmoil of events I found myself marking the Argyllwyddes ' circumspection . Never , never must a maiden be alone with a man where there is a bed nearby ! Owen still stood above the bard , his face all wet with tears , like a statue of grief . He took off his purple short-mantle and , kneeling , laid it tenderly over the wasted form . The dragon of Wales was embroidered on it in gold , and I had the sudden fancy that Wales itself lay there under it , lifeless . There was a little pause ; then from a knot of men Owen 's son Evan came forward , followed by his brothers . He advanced to the foot of the litter . " I swear by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice , sharp and clerkly . " Where is the belt . . . ? " he asked . I thought suddenly , no one had seen it except around Griffith 's neck when we laughed at him that first night . Everyone turned to Griffith , who looked bemused . The Argyllwyddes came close to him , speaking low ; he shook his head . Oh , the booby , I thought , he has lost it ! It was a strange scene , Owen , unmoving , in the midst of all the bustle , silent while the voices rose all about . Suddenly Efa pushed past me . " I know where it is  --  the bard has it ! It is in the bards ' chamber ! Hanging on the wall ! " Which bard , I said to myself , and how does she know ? That one is a puzzle , Efa ! But we turned to look at the bard Griffith  | Lloyd , and he nodded ; there were tears , too , on his face . Someone ran for the belt . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and a sound of many feet , as all the company lined up to take the oath . There were two Cistercian monks here tonight ; they pushed forward importantly , so as to be first . The Cistercians are the most Welsh of all the clergy , and fiercely patriotic . I knew one of them by sight , Father Ambrosius ; I saw that his eyes shone with excitement . There were both of them large , burly men , in rough wadmal habits , more soldier than churchman . At their girdles they wore short swords ; I saw no sign of bead or crucifix , and their tonsures were growing out , making their heads look very odd . Through all this Owen stood , unseeing ; someone thrust the belt into his hands . He looked down at it , from far away , as if it were a snake he held . Slowly I saw the understanding come into his eyes ; he gave a little sigh as of regret and turned to the waiting crowd . Briefly he raised the belt aloft ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strong , the cry , " Owen , Prince of Wales ! Wales and Owen ! " Father Ambrosius advanced to the foot of what was now the bier , and his deep , rich voice , trained to intone the Latin ritual , rose above the hubbub . " I swear by the Belt of Eliseg to be true man and liege servant to the puissant Prince Owen ap Griffith Fychan as long as my breath shall last ! " The second monk echoed his words , each touching the sacred relic in Owen 's hands . It looked , in truth , a sorry thing , an old rag of leather , moldy and black from all the swearing done already in its name , but no one but me seemed to see it in this way , and many even raised it to their lips as they made their vows . The noise in the hall was now so wild that it hurt the ears , but Owen did not raise a hand to quiet it ; he seemed to be in one of his " fits , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not there , but somewhere inside himself . The world flows about him like water around a rock in midstream ; it is strange and chilling but does not last long . I remembered that Rhisiart had asked me about it , saying that it made him shiver to see him so . Just then I heard Rhisiart 's name . Someone shouted , " Make him swear ! Make the little Hereford calf swear . . . make him give a kick at his king ! " I had a glimpse of Rhisiart 's face white with strain . He was liege sub- ject to King Henry , and to swear would be arrant treason and his life forfeit . " Make the damned Lollard swear , Prince Owen ! " cried another voice . " See how a heretic dog takes an honest Christian oath ! " At these words Walter came forward boldly , with a smile . He placed his hand , not on the belt , but on the hilt of Owen 's sword ; the other hand he placed tenderly over the dead man 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At this touch , Owen roused , looking down at the hand on his sword . When he saw who it was , a faint smile crossed his lips . " You , too , Master Brut ? " I had seen before that there was much accord between them . " I swear , too , " said the Lollard , " on the risen Christ , the Saviour of all . " Owen , roused from his trance now , saw Rhisiart where he stood , hesitating . " Make the cousin from Hereford swear ! " the same voice called again . " No need for any of my family to swear , " said Owen , with careless dignity , though most of his sons had sworn already . " Besides , " he said gravely , " we may need our cousin to represent us at Lancaster 's court , as he is a lawyer . It would be a mistake to narrow his freedom by oaths and vows . " He finished easily . Then he raised his head , looking all about . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and all my family , too , if everyone here tonight will vow with me , by Our Lady of Valle Crucis and Saint Derfel of Endyrnion , that we will seek the king 's justice for Wales and ? " He was interrupted by a thunder of voices and a savage clatter of arms , as every hand and every weapon was raised in the air . One voice rose above the others , guttural and wild . " Saint Derfel for Wales ! Saint Derfel for Wales ! " I saw , at the far end , the hairy creature , Rhys Gethin , standing in his chains , and wondered how he had got out of his prison and into hall . But other voices took up the cry , and not only the hall but the very palace seemed to rock and sway to the shout that arose , " Saint Derfel for Wales ! Saint Derfel for Owen Glendower ! Saint Derfel for Owen and Wales ! " Owen stepped lightly up onto a trestle table , raising his hands  | for silence . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Margaret and I have only to tell you that there will be mead and wine in hall till midnight . Griffith Lloyd ap Dafydd ab Einion will sing to you . . . he will sing of the dead and the living  --  of our wrongs and of our hopes . He will sing the glory of lolo Goch , our dead friend . . . he will sing of the rise and fall of Dinas Bran . . . He will sing of the great King Eliseg of our house upon whose belt you have sworn . . . . " And as he spoke , there was a movement of relaxation all over the hall , men began to sink to their places by the fire , their weapons clattering softly as they settled . I saw the menat-arms leave , and the great gate outside being opened , as the guard was relieved . Owen stepped down then ; taking a goblet of wine , he stood over the bier where the dead bard lay , muttering Welsh words low . He took , then , a long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sprinkled the body . It was some old ritual , I suspect , or maybe some private communication of his own , but it is such doings that give Owen a reputation for trafficking in magic . He made a sign , then , to some servants , to take the body into chapel . He stood there , for a while , sunk in thought , sipping the wine . I saw , sitting alone by the fire , my stepbrother Griffith , staring gloomily into the flames . All about him was excitement and chatter , but he sat on , rubbing first one shin and then another , as he felt the heat scorching him . I felt myself alone , too , for Catherine was at her Rhisiart 's side , and all the maidens had drifted off ; I would have gone to Griffith , but he made no sign , though he saw me watching , only turned back and went on gazing into the heart of the flames . I felt shy and foreign , suddenly , among all this Welshness ; the singing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , haunting and wild , on the air . I would have gone to my chamber , but a touch came on my arm . It was Meredith , and I smiled at him gratefully . " How is Elliw ? " I asked , for I knew he had been with her above-stairs . " She is sleeping soundly now  --  we gave her a potion . . . the whole thing is a great shock to her , of course . . . . " " She is such a little goose , usually " I began . " She is a very brave girl , " Meredith said quietly . Oh-oh , I thought , another love-struck one . But I said no more and pointed to Griffith . " He has not sworn either , " said Mere- dith . " I was upstairs , so could not come forward . . . but Father noticed Griffith , I think . " " But Owen said our family need not swear , " I began . " That was the reason  --  before anyone could call shame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the oath , I think . He never liked Iolo and thinks Father was bewitched in a way . . . . Griffith has no heart for music or poetry . He thinks the bards are all half mad . " He gave a little smile and looked at me in an impish kind of way . " I daresay he 's right , too . . . . " I nodded , smiling too . " It is the madness of genius , " I said . Meredith went on , more soberly . " Griffith will go along with whatever is decided , but he thinks it 's silly to break with the king just because of Grey . He hates all this Welshness and superstition and oath-taking . . . But Father feels  --  and I think he 's right that if Wales is ever liberated , it 'll be through madmen and bards , through hotheads and firebrands , through Derfelites and patriots , rather than through the counsels of the prudent . . . . " Rhisiart had come up then with Catherine , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be wiser to wait ? " he said . " Will Owen really let them proclaim him on September the sixteenth ? What was that all about ? " He looked more than ever like a young eagle , with his dark face flushed and his eyes shining . Meredith obviously did not trust the English part of him , for he brushed the question aside and said merely , with a vague wave of his hand , " Oh , Father will wait for another sign , I suppose . . . . " But I had seen Owen 's face when Iolo named the date , and I knew he took it seriously . Rhisiart 's thin lips drew in at Meredith 's withdrawal ; one could almost see his feathers wilt . Catherine , noticing this , said quickly , " Come , let 's go out on the wall and look at the fires . . . . It 's still Midsummer Night . . . . " It had grown a little chill ; there were no stars , and the night was very black . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wall . When we stood on top of it , a strong wind blew in our faces . " It feels as though September had come already , " said Meredith softly in my ear ; I shivered , and he put his arm about my shoulders as we stood staring at the fires . " How many did you count before ? " I whispered softly , watching . " Nine , " he answered , very quiet . I went over them again in  | my head  --  seven , eight , nine and , to the left , a tenth , larger , a wall of flame , blowing in great tongues to the west . Meredith 's arm tightened on my shoulder . " Valle Crucis , " he said . " It 's Valle Crucis . . . the English are burning Valle Crucis . . . . We four turned frightened faces toward one another in the dark . " Yes , " Meredith said slowly . " I think September the sixteenth has come . . . . "  | Since the burning of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Some were killed when the English attacked the monastery , and a few died in the flames , but most of them were saved . Of the nuns , not one remains ; there is no trace of them , so it is believed they were all captured . It is a very wicked thing the English did , for the monastery was without defenses , and all the people were helpless against the marauders . Already , though , they have begun to pay for it . When we sighted the Valle Crucis fire on Midsummer Night , Owen rode swiftly to its defense , with all his sons and a great company of armed followers . No one of our side was wounded , even , but the English suffered great losses , for those that remained were taken by surprise . Owen took some captives , too , among them Lord Grey and his son . They are in the donjon keep , awaiting ransom from old Bolingbroke . I would not be in their shoes , for Owen has asked an enormous sum for them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Owen will not put them to death , but they do not know that , of course ; it is satisfying to think of them lying there , underground , in discomfort and terror , after what they have done . I have never been vengeful or bloodthirsty , but jail is too good for these devilish men . Alice goes every day to look through the bars and taunt them , calling them all manner of filthy names . In a way , one can not blame her , seeing how she has suffered at their hands , but it is not the act of a gentlewoman . That she is not , of course , but Walter says it is not the act of a Christian either . He reproaches her constantly , quoting Scripture , but for once she will not listen . I saw these men , the father and son , when they were brought in that first morning . One could almost feel sorry for them ; they were in a dreadful state . Covered with mud they were , their clothes all tattered and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stumbled as he walked , for blood kept running down into his eyes from a great cut on his brow . All the women shouted insults at them , and threw stones and garbage , for they are  | objects of great hate among the peasantry roundabout . They have ever been oppressors of the people , in the English way , but lately they have done worse  --  rapings , as with Alice , and slaughter and plunder , too . Strange , that one can not read their wickedness in their faces ; they just looked wretched and sick and conquered . The father is even well favored , though the son looks somewhat like a frog . Old Grey , I saw , did everything he could to protect his boy , trying to shield him from the women 's blows . It is strange to think of such a monster knowing love , but Owen says such feelings are instinctive to most things that live , even rats . As I said , one can hardly walk about without bumping into a monk , and they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at corners , and exhorting them in the name of all that is holy to go to war . These same monks call it a Welsh crusade , and the Derfelites want to bring back all the old customs , while the students and Lollards want political and religious freedom and the peasantry want a revolt against all nobility . It is said that more and more students , Lollards , and just discontented serfs are crossing over into Wales , all ready to fight beside Owen . Owen , in the meantime , is playing a waiting game . I think he still hopes for some kind of peace terms from the king . There is a constant stream of visitors : high officials , prophets , and foreign dignitaries . He is closeted away with somebody or the other every night . There have been Frenchmen from the Valois king , and from Burgundy , too . Burgundy is like another king , there in France . I do not know much , but Meredith says Owen will not enter into real battle with Bolingbroke without help from France @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though Owen will not admit it and will make no move except for reprisals . Last night there was an envoy from the Pope at Rome . ( There arc two Popes , one in Avignon , which is really pretty silly , when you come to think of it . ) Anyway , this man , an Italian , very small , and swarthy , and sly-looking , pretended to have an important message for Owen from his master , and all the while , he carried another for the usurper Bolingbroke in a pouch beneath his shirt ! One of the pages found it while the man was bathing . Owen was very angry and sent the man on to Bolingbroke , with another demand for the Greys ' ransom , twice again what he had first asked ; the sum , he said , went up with each delay . The sixteenth of September has come and gone , and true to  | old Iolo 's memory , Owen was proclaimed Prince of Wales , not only here , but in other places all over Wales . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is not with Owen , except for Nannau , in the south , where Hywele Sele is lord . This Hywele Sele is a near kinsman of Owen 's , too , but he has always been an enemy and pro-Lancaster . No one knows why they are enemies , but it is some old quarrel of their youth ; one can see that Owen hates the man ; it is in his eyes whenever Nannau is mentioned . About a month after the proclamation , in October it was , and the days still beautiful but growing cooler , a great group of us young folk rode out along the road to Mathrafal . Halfway there , there is a beautiful woods , dense with all sorts of growth , the kind of place where you can almost see Arthur and Merlin . I had been there once before , in the spring of the year , but truly it is said to be a wondrous sight in autumn , with all the leaves changing color and blazing against the sky . We were all looking forward to it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were planning a whole day 's outing . It was a glorious day , diamond-clear , with a little wind from the north whipping into our cheeks and making them tingle . I wore a leather jerkin , dyed green , with a dragon , our arms , embroidered on the front . It is the mate to Catherine 's ; Owen had them made for us when I first came here . There is a shirt under , to match , and hose of a darker hue . There is a picking out of scarlet and gold threads on the dragon , so we are quite gay . All the damsels but Alice are in hose , so that we look like pages , except for our hair , which we wear braided , for neatness while we ride . Catherine , though , is riding amongst all her brothers ; she will not come near to poor Rhisiart . I am sorry for him ; he looks like a broody eaglet , hunched on his mount , an old piebald thing that he has had since he learned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cuddled with Efa in a dark passage abovestairs ; she did not tell the Argyllwyddes , but she will not speak to him either ; Catherine is not forgiving . I have told her that he is not to blame , a man would have to be made of stone when Efa comes rubbing against him ; there is not one , I warrant , that she has not dallied with , including the old minstrels and her own brothers even . But Catherine rides ahead , and Rhisiart is sunk in gloom .  | The road to Mathrafal is straight and smooth as though cut by a knife . It was made by the Romans long ago and has only fallen away in spots here and there . It runs between thickets of trees and bushes , all gold and red , and in places our horses ' feet go ankle-deep in the bright leaves that have fallen already . The birds make a small savage music all about , those that have not yet flown off to their winter homes . We have to look hard to find them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now and then one flits across under our noses . It is all pretty and magical , the scene , except for Rhisiart sulking . I tried to cheer him , humming an old rhyme that has to do with birds , but the only words I could remember were far from heartening . Surprisingly , though , he raised his head , interest lively in his face . " What is that song ? " he asked . " I had a Welsh nurse . . . she used to sing it to me when I was no higher than her knee ? " " I have forgot the words , " I said , laughing , " except the part at the end , and it is passing sad . . . . " " Sing it ! " I began softly : " Woe for us ! Woe for us ! The embers are dead. /The Birds of Rhiannon are all flown away , /Beauty has gone with the Blessed Head. /We are left to the sword and the wind and the clay ! " A voice joined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the verse . It was the Lollard , Master Walter , who had ridden up with his Alice . There was a glow on his face as though he listened to an angel ; I am not so good a singer as that , but I held back the merry quip that rose to my lips , watching his countenance . We four , even Alice , who is not any part Welsh , rode in silence for a while , thinking on the old lament . I thought of the fall of the Old Kingdom and the turmoil in modern Wales and shuddered to imagine what might be the outcome of this present conflict . Beside me , Rhisiart said , " A goose has walked over your grave ! " He spoke lightly , and I saw his mood had lifted . " I do not know the saying . . . . " I said . " Oh , it is English . . . they always say it when someone shivers . . " It is Latin , too , " said Walter . " I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to talking of language sources and such , their scholars ' minds kindling . By and by Walter began to point out the birds to Alice , naming their Latin names , and some , too , that have Greek ones . I know enough of both tongues for that , so we all began vying with one another to flaunt our knowledge . Except for Alice , of course , who has no learning . She did not mind though and repeated the words haltingly after us , like a child at its nurse 's knee . We were very merry and lagged along on our mounts , letting them nibble at will among the grasses by the side of the road . I noticed , somewhere in the back of my mind , that all the other riders had passed us , even the men-at-arms who were bringing up the rear . I looked ahead , seeing the road stretching empty before us . There was a sharp rise ahead , where the road bridged a goodsized stream ; we could not see over it and had lost sight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I said , spurring my horse . We all fell silent then and pushed our horses on . The bridge still climbed before us , rounding over the stream , so that we had no sight , still , of those ahead , but I caught a gleam , too bright for water , beneath , and gave a little cry , pointing . A head , helmeted , came into view ; a horseman , mounted and in armor , rode up from the bank of the stream under the bridge . Another followed and another , and then they were upon us , too many to count . " They are of Lancaster ! " cried Rhisiart , wheeling his horse . The poor animal , unused to any sudden move , rose on his hind feet , pawing the air and neighing in terror . All our horses took fright , too , and behaved like unbroken colts . I am a good horsewoman , but even I could not get sense into my mount , though I pulled at his head with all my strength . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We are unarmed ! " cried the Lollard . " Would you draw sword on ladies ? " shouted Rhisiart , his Norman face dark red in rage . " This one is no lady " one of the men guffawed , pointing to Alice " it is the Greys ' whore . . . . " At this Alice opened her mouth and screamed shrilly , as she had done that night when Rhys Gethin had slain her lover . I reached over and grabbed her arm , my fingers biting into her  | flesh to quiet her . " Sh-h-h " I hissed into her ear . " We are too few the others will hear you and ride back , and we will all be captured , or worse . . . . By now Rhisiart 's horse had stopped thrashing about , and he , too , had forced back his first quick anger . He spoke haughtily , with that high-nosed Norman look that cows all the English . " Where is your captain ? I will not parley with men-at-arms ! " He looked so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parting their ranks . A big , burly man came riding forward then , dressed in light mail , and with his head bare . He drew no sword , and his face had a good-natured look about it , for all he wore the Lancaster colors . " I am Denis Burnell , " he said , " constable of Dinas Bran . I am at your service , Lady Catherine , " he went on , turning to me . I opened my mouth to correct him , but Rhisiart , beside me , gave me such a kick on the ankle that I went pale . I stole a look at him and saw him frown warningly . The man Burnell continued . " I am come to bring you back to the castle , in the king 's name . You must stand as hostages for the Greys till your worthy father sees fit to release them . " There was a hint of irony in his last words , and a faint smile played about his lips , but he maintained his courteous attitude . Rhisiart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hostage gladly , and I can speak for Sir Walter too , I trust  --  but I must beg you to let these ladies go ! It is against the laws of chivalry to hold women . . . . " " They will suffer no hurt , I promise you , " Burnell said with dignity . " But stay they must . . . they will lodge in the Ladies ' Tower , the Lady Catherine and her serving wench . " His words had a final ring , and his face lost its look of good humor . " I am a citizen of Hereford , " said Rhisiart , " and liege subject to King Henry . I am at present acting-secretary to my kinsman , Baron Owen " " I have heard of you , sirrah , " said Denis Burnell shortly . Rhisiart subsided , with a chastened look . I saw that he suffered embarrassment before me and did not look at him just then . " Permit me to escort you , Lady , " said Burnell , bowing gravely in his saddle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a fully grown gentlewoman ; it flustered me , and I nodded my head , without words . He led the way , back down where he had come  | from . I followed , seeing that the streambed was dry and made , indeed , a passable road , cutting to the west . We did not even have to lower our heads as we passed under the bridge , it rose so high . They put no restraint upon us , letting us ride as we would , so we kept together , talking low among ourselves . There were soldiers all about , before and behind ; it was useless to attempt to free ourselves . Burnell rode some little way ahead , out of earshot . Rhisiart said , looking wise , " Let them think you Catherine ; it will give us better bargaining power . As for me , I shall make much of being close kinsman to Owen " I thought wryly , What difference will any of this make if the English mean mischief ? We are in their power . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are right . . . the more value they place upon us , the more care they will take . Me , they will have heard of , no doubt . But , as I have already been acquitted of heresy , they can not , with any fairness , bring me to trial again . It is Alice I fear for " As she made a sudden move , he laid a hand on her arm , saying , " Look I shall say she is my wife , Mistress Brut of Clyde . . . I am a knight ; it will give her standing . Besides , " he went on , " it is what I wish , if she will have me . . . I stole a look at Alice ; her face was very white , and there were tears on it ; she was too moved to speak . " Will you have me , Mistress Alice ? " asked the Lollard , smiling . " It is no great bargain I am a confessed heretic . . . She nodded dumbly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . Let them burn me , too ! " He raised her hand to his lips . " So be it then . . . but no talk of ' burning . The English do not burn women " " My mother , " she said stubbornly , " they burned my mother ! " " Your mother , " he said , with a sweet reasonableness , " your mother was an avowed witch . " And , so saying , he made the sign against the evil eye , the two middle fingers folded in , and the forefinger and little finger held stiffly outward . I was aghast . I have seen the soldiers and the peasants make just such a sign against Walter himself ! Rhisiart had been watching them curiously ; I think he won ' tiered at the Lollard 's choice  --  he has the Norman snobbery . He snapped his fingers suddenly .  | " I can marry you ! " he said . " I am a clerk-at-law ! " But then , as suddenly , his face fell . " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " No matter , " said Walter . " It is a fine idea . . . we can perhaps find them there at Dinas Bran . " I could not imagine what he thought to find there , in the enemy camp , but I said nothing and fell to thinking of our plight . None of us spoke for a little : I think we were all a bit afraid ; I know I was . I was surprised to see Walter ride boldly forward to Burnell and seek converse with him . We watched them talking , it seemed quite amiably . Beside me , Rhisiart bit his lip ; he was most likely chagrined that the Lollard had shown so bravely , while he rode along with girls . Walter came back presently , a smile on his face . " They are taking us to Dinas Bran , " he said . Well , we all have surmised that , I thought , a trifle acidly , but I said nothing . " The Percys are there , with some other English lords , all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to our cause . We may yet thank the heavens for this happenstance . . . we may perhaps be emissaries of peace even . . . . " " Hotspur ! " cried Rhisiart , his dark features lighting up . Ah , I thought , even our little scholar-clerk is not armored against the magic of Hotspur 's fame . He is the idol of all the youth of Britain . " They say the young prince is with him , learning the arts of war , " said Rhisiart . " He , too , has much respect for Owen . . . at Oxford he had many friends among the Welsh . . . . " " Among our Lollard brothers , too , " said Walter . " Oldcastle was his master . . . . " They both brightened visibly , while my heart , unaccountably , began to beat very hard .  | The first sight of Dinas Bran is enough to shake the heart , especially coming upon it as the sun waned and seeing it dark and wild against a blood-red sky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The castle stands upon a high crag and can be seen for miles around . Even so , none of us had ever glimpsed it , for it had long been an English stronghold . We all four fell silent , gazing at it , and even the rough talk of the border soldiers died down , though perhaps they were just weary . They had , after all , ridden both ways that day . Dinas Bran is the oldest fortress in Wales , getting its name from Bran the Blessed , who lived long , long ago , before written history , and only the old songs tell of him . He was a hero-king , a giant , so it is said . And indeed , the castle looks as though it were flung up by giants in a time beyond thinking on ; even its ruination seems to have been done by giants , hurling thunderbolts . Its roofline is jagged and savage against the sky , its windows like blinded eyes , red where the setting sun pours through . It broods above a gentle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the roadbed of the stream and journeyed along a winding trail beside a tiny brook where late flowers still bloomed among the reeds . The way seemed endless , always the lortress high above us ; it looked inaccessible . I glanced at Rhisiart , beside me ; his face looked gray and exhausted . I saw that it was covered with grime and dust , streaked where he had wiped away the sweat . We must all look like that , I thought , with some dismay , and pulled my linen smallcloth from under my jerkin . The Argyllwyddes made these I think they were her own invention ; they were for spitting into or blowing the nose and were very useful . I had a little flask , too , at my belt , and I tipped some water onto the cloth , and so made shift to wash my face , in a sort , pinching at my cheeks , too , to bring the color up . I saw Rhisiart look at me curiously and offered him the use of what was left in the flask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , swallowed it down . He handed it back to me , saying , " How do we get up  | there , do you think ? " and squinted at the blazing sky . " It looks deserted , too . . . Do you think they will feed us up there ? " I , too , was hungry ; we had had nothing at midday but some black bread and cheese and a strip of some dried meat , too tough to chew , soldiers ' rations . I thought longingly of the delicate meal we had packed , cold partridge stuffed with herbs , wine , too , and small white loaves fresh from the oven . Surely , they will not starve us , I thought ; we are hostages , after all , not prisoners . But a cold feeling went through me just the same ; who could tell with the English ? There was a soft whimper behind me , and Alice whispered , " Oh , Mistress Morgan , I am sore afeared . . . . " " Hush , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Have courage . We are in the Saviour 's hands . . . and she is the Lady Catherine remember ? And remember , too , you are Mistress Brut , wife of Sir Walter Brut of Clyde in Hereford ! " I prayed that she would remember , for her own sake , though , for myself , I did not too much care for this " Catherine " masquerade , though I knew our captors might well honor more Owen 's legitimate heiress . If indeed , they knew anything at all of honor . I felt a little creeping of fear and tried to push it down . I pushed down the thought of Harry , too , telling myself he would have forgotten me for sure , anyway , after all the time that had passed . We had begun the ascent of the hill now ; the road did not wind , as I had imagined it must but went straight upward , a steep incline . I looked again at the massive ruin above ; how , in Derfel 's name , had they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? My back ached as I thought of the poor slaves who must have done it . And I thought , too , of the common folk , still almost enslaved in England , and here , too , if truth were told . Will they gain really if Owen is victorious ? " It 's a real Welsh fortress , " said Rhisiart , looking up . " Built before Edward 's time , probably in the time of Bad John . . . . " I shook my head . " Oh , no , " I said . " It is much older than that , older than the Caesars . . . . " The Lollard said slowly , " Its foundations are older . . . it has been built upon an older site many times rebuilt , perhaps . . . . I have heard that it was first a hill-city , before it was a fortress at all . . . . " " All that is hearsay " began Rhisiart hotly , and they were  | off ! By Our Lady , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is the very pulse of life to them ! I reached behind me and took the reins of Alice 's mount . " Come , Mistress Alice , " I said , " let us climb this together . We shall rehearse our new selves myself a true-born princess , and you my waiting woman , and a lady-wife ! " And so it came to pass that I rode into the place of my birth , and into the torn pages of Welsh history alike , beside a Saxon byremaid ! There was , at the summit , a huge gate , obviously of recent building , made of some hard wood ; as it swung open I heard a creak of pulleys and knew it was very modern . It was as thick as a man 's body and wide enough for six horses abreast . The password sounded like " Owen whoreson , " which did not reassure me . Though the great gate was new , the walls were from some much earlier time , like the rest of the castle ; they , too , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I remember thinking , why take so much trouble over this fine new gate when all a challenger need do is storm the walls ? In places , indeed , they were completely fallen away , and mounds of rubble stood in their place . There were not so many defenders , either , I noted , scarce half again the number who rode with us . It was much darker inside the walls than out , and true to the Lancaster reputation for stinginess , there were very few lanterns or torches , though twilight was upon us , and the sun almost gone . I blinked , and my horse stumbled . " This way , milady , " said Denis Burnell , who had materialized suddenly before me out of the gloom . I followed him , holding Alice 's hand across the backs of our mounts . I felt , rather than saw , that there was grass underfoot ; we must be in the courtyard . 1 t was vast enough to contain hundreds of tents , it seemed , though it was empty now . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could sec quite well . The place , besides having been damaged in battle , had so fallen into neglect that many of the upper chambers had sunk into the courtyard , leaving only the lower rooms ; one had to pick a way through piles of stones and rubble to get to these . Burnell explained that only the Ladies ' Tower , and some rooms close to the outer wall were habitable ; the great hall , he said , was in use , though accommodations were crude , but the chapel , the library , and the little court were shattered out of all recognition .  | As he pointed them out , I could see , among the heaps of stones , some that still showed their ancient carvings and moldings , barbaric and intricate of design . A light burned in the entrance to the Ladies ' Tower , where he was leading us . As we drew near , I saw it was held by a girl no older than myself but oddly dressed and smelling of some Eastern scent , heavy and pungent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman , Mistress Alice , " the constable said , as he helped us to dismount . " They are to lodge in the tower tonight . . . . " The girl shook her head solemnly . Her eyes were very large , as you will see sometimes on a doe , with that same frightened look . " No coverings , " she said . " Coverings will be sent . " He spoke impatiently . To me , he said , " I will send a page to bring you to the dining hall presently . . . Till then , Catherine ap Glendourdy . . . . " I could not help laughing , as I corrected him . " Ab Owen it is . . . I could not very well be the daughter of two streams ' ! " That is what " Glendower " or " Glendourdy , " as he called it , means in Welsh . As we spoke , I saw that the lamp-bearer crossed herself with her free hand . She beckoned to us then and led the way up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the curving walls had huge cracks in them , enough to let in daylight , had it not been almost dark . But the flame of the lamp she held blew in the gusty drafts and all but went out ; the stones of the stairs were deathly cold , too I could feel them through my leather shoes . I saw then , with a little shock , that the feet of our guide were bare beneath a full skirt of some heavy , dark red stuff . The soles of her feet were dyed the same dull red , and there were twin bracelets around her ankles , gold-colored , and shaped like little snakes . What manner of place is this , I thought and caught myself up , remembering the dim talcs of the ladies of this very tower , of whom my own mother had been one . Was I born here , too , in this tower ? We climbed up and up , winding at every step ; it could not have been very high , but I was panting a little at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the day had tired us . We came out into a round room , surprisingly large and comfortable , with wall hangings and cushioned seats and fur rugs beneath our feet , lit by rushlights in sconces set into the wall .  | I turned to the strange girl . " Why did you cross yourself just now ! " " Owen , " she said , " Owen  --  you said his name . . . he has the dark magic . . . . " " That 's ridiculous ! " I said . " He 's no more a magician than you are ! " " Oh , " she said , nodding and smiling , " I know a little , too . . . from the Lady . . . . " I saw that her large eyes were stupid really , and her mouth hung open and was too wet . I wondered if she was feeble-minded , seeing that she crossed herself again . " The Lady will want to see you , " she said . " I 'll tell her you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place by another door , bewilderingly . I stared at Alice . " What lady is this ? " I wondered aloud . Alice only shrugged ; I think she was reassured by the looks of the place , half-expecting to be put into a cell-keep or worse . I saw a chest with washing things laid out , and a comb and bottles , and above it a mirror hanging . It was made of an old shield , silvered , and curiously wrought ; the design bordering it was a snake motif again , hundreds of little serpents writhing , with forked tongues . It brought to my mind the Medusa monster , who turned men to stone , and for a moment I , too , almost made the cross sign ; then I remembered that Medusa 's hair was made of snakes , and that she was mythical , anyway . I looked in it , seeing myself all nose , for its front was curved to turn aside weapons , but not so bad , otherwise , as I had feared . My hair was coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comb ; it , too , was crowned by a snake 's head . There came a kicking then , at the door where we had entered , and two young boys , in page 's clothes , came in , their arms laden . The taller carried a large caldron , steaming and smelling of lavender . " Where am I to put it ? " he asked , huffing and puffing . " Where is Angharrad ? " he asked , looking about him . " Is that her name . . . the barefoot one ? " I said , smiling at him . He was a pretty youth , curly-haired , with his shoulders broadening already , though his voice still cracked . " You do n't miss much , do you ? . . . Yes , that 's the one , Angharrad . She waits on the lady . She 's the only girl in the tower . . . till now . " He set the pot in the middle of a fine embroidered rug , where it slopped over , making a dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
