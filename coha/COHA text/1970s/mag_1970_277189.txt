Spiro T. Agnew is both weapon and target in this election year . Last week , between campaign forays , he took time out to discuss this dual role , with its problems and rewards , with TIME Correspondents Hugh Sidey and John Stacks . Seated in his luxurious suite in the Executive Office Building , a white marble bust of Socrates staring over his shoulder , the Vice President was tanned from a weekend of tennis in Palm Springs . But he looked and sounded a little weary , and as he spoke , he showed a curious mixture of nearly self-righteous assurance about the accuracy of his charges and an almost sad sense of his own fallibility . <P> I 'M not aware of why I 'm so controversial . But when I look back , controversy has followed me . I was controversial in Baltimore County ; I was a controversial Governor . A lot of it comes from being in a minority party . You have to be aggressive . It is high-risk politics . I have always played high-risk politics . I guess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fun and a lot more effective . <P> I 'm not trying for an image . I 'm not campaigning for myself ; I 'm campaigning for others . I 'm out taking the message to the people . My role is the same as the one Vice President Nixon played for President Eisenhower . It is a purely political role of being the partisan spokesman for the Administration in an election year . <P> I do n't think people are impressed with histrionics , with wild gesticulating . They come to hear what you say , and I want them to hear the words . I worry about the content , and if the mood strikes me I 'll use more alliteration . I also like metaphors . But I do n't need gimmicks to get my message across . <P> I am simply stating what America is all about . I guess it is a holdover from what my father taught me . He had very firm opinions on what was good and what was bad . I guess when you come from another country , like my father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When Agnew was Governor of Maryland he was characterized as a liberal . Has he changed ? <P> Life is a question of emphasis , really . I have n't changed one view since the time I was thought to be a liberal . If the issues under debate today were housing , water pollution and tax reform , I would come out with high liberal marks . If the issues yesterday had been violence and disruption and desecrating of the flag , I would have had high conservative marks . When I was Governor , I strongly supported Lyndon Johnson when there was a gubernatorial effort to rally support against the war . It is a matter of where the emphasis is . <P> I do n't think I 'm more sacrosanct than any radical-liberal because my philosophy differs . I have never had a head-to-head encounter where the opposition has n't scored some points . In that debate with the college kids on the David Frost Show , I found out they are really highly motivated . They are not simply looking for publicity . But I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such assurance . <P> Does Agnew like campaigning ? <P> Oh , yeah , it 's enjoyable . Particularly since the response is so good . I like the handshaking . I guess it grows on you . I did n't like it as well when I first started out . And it takes a little doing . But when you see me go to those airport fences , it is out of choice more than design .
