LAW AND DISORDER <P> Directed by IVAN PASSER <P> Screenplay by IVAN PASSER , WILLIAM RICHERT and KENNETH HARRIS FISHMAN <P> The shrink will not stand up . Here he is , at a tenants ' meeting of Co-Op Village , which he has agreed to address on the psychology of rape . He just sits on the rostrum , arms folded , waiting for his check . Only when one of the tenants breathlessly delivers his fee does he start in-and what a start . He leaps up , shoots a blank pistol out into the audience , frightens the women , describes instead the physiology of rape in such heated detail that tremblings because of the shots are replaced with giggles . He asks for a volunteer from the audience and proceeds to use her as what might be called a rape object . He is rather a madman . <P> This role is wonderfully defined by Alan Arbus , a resourceful comic actor Lest hopes be raised too high , however , let it quickly be added that Arbus is a supporting player in Law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a film that is otherwise filled with hollow horse-laughs about the hard lot of life in Manhattan . The two stars of the movie are Carroll O'Connor and Ernest Borgnine , who appear as a couple of working stiffs fighting back against the indignities of existence in a big city their children are molested , flashers approach their wives , their apartments are forever being burglarized . So they and their neighbors band together to form an auxiliary police force . The uniforms and the cop paraphernalia make guys whom politicians have called " the little man " all their lives feel a little bit bigger Law and Disorder lets Carroll O'Connor step only slightly out of his All in the Family role . O'Connor 's cab driver has the same inflection and bitterness as Archie Bunker Given a good scene , however-such as the sequence in which he tells his wife about his disappointments and dreams - O'Connor proves that he is still a dexterous and poignant actor <P> Law and Disorder is the work of Ivan Passer , whose Intimate Lighting was one of the highlights of that brief burst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Blonde and Closely Watched Trains . This is his second American feature and it betrays an addled , even desperate sensibility . Passer 's talents have received scant nourishment on American soil . <P> J.C .
