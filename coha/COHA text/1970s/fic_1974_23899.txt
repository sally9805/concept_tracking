NIGHT AND DAY AT PANACEA A story by Reynolds Price ? AUGUST 1904 E SCARED THE OLD NEGRO , not by intention Cif but because the path was wet and silent from the hard rain shower toward four o'clock and because  --  soaked himself and tired from the long walk  --  he looked more harmful than in fact he was . The old man dropped the plank he had loudly wrenched from the shed ( there were three more at his feet , good dry heart-pine ) and said , " Who you after ? " Forrest smiled ? " Nobody " and knew it was the first lie he 'd told in months . " They ai n't here then . They ai n't been here . I 'm the man here and the white man give me permission for this . " He pointed to the shed 's south wall  --  half stripped of siding , the uprights exposed to day . Green light slotted to the dry earth floor . Forrest looked to the floor . The white flint circles of masonry were there , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the center of the room to be dark . The old man said , " Who are you ? " Forrest bent to see . Both springs were there ? far down in the shade , clogged with the trash of years , spider silk , but visibly running , their overflow absorbed by buried piping that , miraculously open , carried the water outdoors , downhill . A chained enamel cup stood on the rim of the closer spring . Forrest reached to take it ( seeing , as he reached , that its mate was gone , ripped from its chain and nowhere in sight ) . " Drink a drop of that , you 'll die before night . " Forrest looked up , smiling . " I may anyhow . " " You sick ? " Forrest nodded and extended his soaked arms . " Pneumonia . " " Not in August , " the Negro said . " Then exhaustion . I have walked fourteen miles since breakfast . I have not eaten since . I am tired , wet , hungry ; and my wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ghost . " He intended fun . " You a man . What your name ? " " Forrest Mayfield . " " Where from ? " " Up north . Near Bracey , Virginia . " " That 's a hundred miles . " " You been there ? " Forrest said . The Negro said , " Near it . " " Who are you ? " Forrest said . " Eighty-some years old . " " How long you lived here ? " " Most of my life  --  last forty years . " The old eyes , yellow as piano keys , met Forrest 's , unblinking . " Where were you in April a year ago then ? " The Negro thought . " Bound to been here , " he said . " You were hiding then . " " What you aiming at ? " " I was here that April with twenty schoolchildren , a dozen mothers , three or four teachers besides myself , buggies and horses  --  there was nobody here . " The man said , " What 's the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He pointed at the springs with a black hand folded and dry as Forrest 's grip . " You think that 's one of them healing springs ? " Forrest said , " The old folks did . awhile back . " He squatted by the circles . " They all dead , ai n't they ? " " Who ? " " Them folks , and what they thought . " Forrest looked at the old face . It was almos surely smiling . " Dead and gone , " he said . The Negro said , " I know what I 'm talkink about . 1 worked at one of them places in Vir ginia , when I was a boy . Were n't nothing bu water . Make your pecker work . Like anybody ' : water . " He stood while the words worked ore to Forrest through cool damp dimness . Then 111 also squatted and faced Forrest , eye level , eigh feet away . Then he broke into high continuou laughter  --  a boy 's voice , young . Helpless , Forrest joined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LI of side meat and hominy and kettle coffee on the smallest stove in the kitchen of the abandoned Springs Hotel , using the boards from the springhouse as fuel . Then  --  the Negro leading ? they climbed the back stairs and walked the long hall to the front of the house , the second-story porch . The old man carried the hot iron pan with their mutual food ; Forrest carried the kettle and the two spring cups , haying wrenched off the last one at the Negro 's instructions . The porch floor was thick with branches , dead leaves , fallen hornets ' nests , a child 's shoe ; but a space had been cleared at the breezy north end . The Negro headed there and , with his free hand , motioned Forrest to sit in the better place on the floor with his back to the wall of the house , looking out at the top of the thick undergrowth which had reached that high . The man himself sat  --  as easy as a boy  --  with his back to the posts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knife , halved the meat , and pushed the pan toward Forrest . " Half of it yours . " " Thank you , " Forrest said and reached out his hand . " Forgot your spoon . " The Negro felt himself on both breast pockets , reached into one , and drew out a tin spoon and held it to Forrest . " Where 's yours ? " Forrest said . " Just one , " he said . " Just one , for company . I got good fingers . " He flexed his long fingers ? the spoon still in them . So Forrest took the spoon ; and they ate in silence  --  each consuming exactly half of all the pan held and hot cups of coffee . By then , with the thickness of leaves around them , they were nearly in darkness . Lightning bugs had started their signaling . The old man searched himself again , found a plug of tobacco , and again with his Mark Strodi 71 knife cut two equal chews and offered one to Forrest . He took it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silence continued while they both made starts on the rich dark cud . The quiet , the general peace was so heavy  --  despite the presence three feet away of a strange old Negro , maybe wild , with a knife  --  that it calmed whatever pain or fear had survived Forrest 's day , the long hot walk . Or not so much calmed as pressed it down by a greater force his need for rest having found perfect harbor in this place like a happy afterworld for heroes destroyed in the war of love , an Elysium promised in no religion palpably here , tonight , and his . At last the Negro rose , spat over the rail , and said , " Mayfield  --  that your truthful name ? " " Yes , " Forrest said . " That name I told you  --  that wo n't my truthful name . " Forrest was certain he had heard no name  --  its absence was part of the peace he 'd felt  --  but he said , " All right . " " I do n't tell my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right with me . I 'm obliged to you for kindness . I 'll be leaving at daylight . " " What you doing here ? " the Negro said . " You invited me to supper . " " In that shed , I mean  --  by them dirty springs . " He spat again . Forrest also stood and quietly turned out the contents of his mouth to the dark leaves below . Then he swallowed two mouthfuls of bitter spit in the effort to cleanse his tongue and teeth . His hack was turned to both the Negro and the springhouse , but his voice was clear and firm . This is where a young lady and I made a promise some time ago . I came back to see it . " " You seen it , ai n't you ? " " What was left of it , " Forrest said . " The little you had left . " He wanted to laugh but his head turned instead ; and he begged the Negro , " Who are you ? What are you doing here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Negro said . " I never knew you , never heard you was coming . All I thought was , nobody here for thirty , forty years ; nobody cooling ; I 'm keeping me warm . " Though the heat of the day had barely lifted , he cradled his arms on himself , rubbed his shoulders . Calm again , Forrest said , " Tell me something to call you . " The Negro thought . " You need to call me , you call me Gid . " " Thank you , " Forrest said . Then he sat again by the cold iron pan and looked up to meet the Negro 's eyes  --  hardly possible now , with the progress of evening . " Beg your pardon , " he said . " I 'd have blamed whoever I spoke to today . I 'm in serious trouble . " Gid nodded . " Who you kill ? " " That girl that loved me . " Forrest felt that his answer was in fact the truth , though he also knew it would throw this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted that  --  strike , counterstrike . " And you come back here to the place you found her ? " " Yes . " " They looking for you ? " ' ' No , " Forrest said . " They starting tomorrow ? " " No , " Forrest said . " They already found her ? and they ai n't hunting you ? " " They got her . They do n't care where I go . " She white ? " " Yes , " Forrest said . " You crazy , ai n't you ? " Forrest laughed a little and nodded . " But safe . " " Where you going tomorrow ? " " Back home . Virginia . " " Who waiting for you ? " " Kin-people , my job . " " That 's one more thing than waits on me . " " What 's that ? " Forrest said . " Dying . Sickness . That do make two . " He was smiling apparently ; his voice seemed filtered through a broad smile . " No people at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Oh , I 've got people , I 'm fairly sure  --  two questions about them : where they at ? they waiting for me ? " Forrest said . " Who are you ? " He waited a little . " I 'm perfectly safe . Never hurt a fly . That 's half my problem . " " Just killed your woman ? " Forrest nodded . The lie seemed a handsome gift , return for shelter . B ANKY PATTERSON , " the Negro said , " born what they called a slave , around here  --  somewhere around here , some eighty years past . A good while past , leastways , anyhow  --  this place wo n't built when I was born , not as I recall . What I recall  --  you seen I 'm in my good mind , ai n't you ? " Forrest nodded , all dark . " What I recall  --  my mama belonged to a man named Fitts that owned this land through here , 300 acres . His own house stood where we at now  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my mama had a little place near your springs . They was there , same as now  --  no shed to roof them but dirty as now . Every . body round here cleaned them out once at least , as a child , and drank a cold handful  --  bitter as alum , tasted like a fart , a month-old egg  --  but nobody ever took a second drink and , sure God , nobody ever thought the world would pay toy drink it . They did for a while so it look like , do n't it ? So word got to me  --  but I never had to watch it : dances and sick folks , sick folk dancing . I got out of here . " He stopped as if at the sudden end of a stock of generosity he 'd thought was larger . " When was that ? " Forrest said . " You tell me , " he said . " That 's most of my study  --  when things happen ; how they got away from me . " He stopped again and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  if I 'm eighty-some now , what was I at the freedom ? " Forrest calculated with his finger on the dark floor . " Forty-some , I guess . " " Seem like to me I was older than that  --  feel like it , anyhow . But maybe not . All my children were born after freedom , so I was still plenty good when it come . I never had married in slavery times . I waited it out . I knew I was waiting . " " For what ? " Forrest said . " A fair chance to see my way to the end . The Fittses was good but the Fittses was people . They did n't own many niggers , did n't need to ? rich as they was , little as they farmed  --  so they sold they surplus off every year , or give them away to they children and kin . I had good eyes ; I looked and saw ; and when I got to twelve and they kept me on  --  twelve was when they weeded , before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold your own . Tend your own heart , else they break it to hell . ' " Why did they keep you ? " Forrest said . " My mama fought for me . Some people say I was kin to the Fittses , and they kept they own . I used to be brighter in the skin than now ; bright niggers darken  --  you notice that ? I always aimed , when I got grown , to ask Mama what was the truth of that ; but I never did and now I reckon it 's past too late . " It was nearly full night . ER HUSBAND WAS DOLFUS , lived some miles ri from here on another place ; and when he come to see her once a month on a pass from his master , she make me sleep in the yard if it 's summer . But that do n't make me call him father , and I still ai n't . The thing I knott , is , Mama fought for me . I never heard her do it ; but Zack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ played with . He say my mama come in one evening to where they all set talking in the parlor and tell the master she need to talk . He rise up and go to meet her in the hall and ask what 's troubling  --  she they head cook , they jewel  --  and she say , Banky . ' What Banky done ? ' he say . ' Nothing , ' she say , ' but you want to kill me , you send him off . I dead in two months . My heart dry in me . ' Any nigger say that but Mama be beat  --  good as he was , he wo n't stand that . But Zack tell me his papa say ' Julia , go home and sleep , ' and she know she won . So I had me two debts ? to Mama and Master  --  and I paid on them for all them years till freedom come , a good blacksmith ; I 'm still strong as iron . And , like I tell you , I had me a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ruin it . I ai n't saying I turned into no steer  --  too many heifers around for that , and they coming at me  --  but I tell you what 's truth , white man , once I done humped and groveled my way through the two , three years I was getting my nature , I found out that stuff wo n't all they claiming . You can buy it and sell it or get it free ; but it ai n't going to cure one trouble you got , not the least boil rising on your black ass . " Forrest said , " Why ? " " You tell me , " he said . " I big a fool as you . By time freedom come , my mama was crazy ; had lost every bit of the sense she had . Times was hard  --  niggers all turning wild , white folks turning mean , white trash taking over , our master dead , Zack killed in the war , Mistress and her two girls setting out here just staring at the woods like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you say I am  --  full-growed man  --  and leave her , leave Mama with Dip her onliest sister and strike out north . Three reasons why : no work round here , nothing I can do for Mama but watch her eat dirt from the roadbank and pick at herself and some Yankee pass through holding a paper saying ironworkers wanted in Baltimore , a dollar a day . So I walk to Maryland , Baltimore . No such thing . They ai n't hiring niggers . I ought to come home ; but what I eat if I come here ? old honeysuckle ? So I walk down on the map a little and penetrate all round the state of Virginia , doing nigger jobs  --  a little blacksmithing , a whole lot of digging ; everybody back then always digging holes . " " Were you still by yourself ? Traveling alone ? " " I left that out . Well , to answer your question  --  yes , I traveled alone ; light as rabbit fur . But a whole lot of time I was standing still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Two or three wives ; three , four sets of children . All named for me . " " Where are they now ? " He looked round slowly , both sides and behind , as though they all might have gathered while he talked , as though by speaking he had summoned not only their memory but their faces , palpable bodies . " They ai n't with me . I ai n't with them . " " You 've come here hunting them ? " " No indeed . They never heard of here . I never used to tell present folks my past . " Forrest said , " Is the story you 're telling me true ? " He felt that an answer was urgent to him now ; he did n't know why . " Pretty nearly , pretty nearly  --  the way I recall it . " " Then go on . Tell the rest , to now . " The Negro waited . " Nothing else , " he said . " What you expect ? Eighty years of getting up , working , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you need eighty years  --  which I ai n't got . " " Please . Why are you here , in this old place ? " " Same reason as you  --  looking . " " For what ? " " My mama . " Forrest gave a little chuff through his nose  --  laugh , wonder . " She be in her hundreds , if you counting right . Nothing but a girl when I was born . She always say I parted her ways while they still was green  --  I her live firstborn . I looking for her . " Forrest said , " Why ? " " To see her again , see do she know me , did she ever get well , get her right mind back , let her blame me some . " " Blame for what ? " " Not fighting no harder for her , when I could . " Forrest said , " How could you ? " " Sat and watched her , talked to her , answered her questions . All the stuff I thought was vain . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Me , " he said quickly and struck at himself ? palm on his chest , twice , dry hollow thumps . Then he waited and thought and said , " Who the hell you ? all time doubting me , all time asking why ? I 'm telling you what , the what I recall , what I need to find . If you here to listen , you listen to what . It 's all I giving . " Forrest also waited . Then he said , " Beg your pardon . " " I do n't beg yours . Who you anyhow ? " Forrest told him again  --  his name , age , home , his work . " And you killed your woman ? " " What she felt for me , yes . " " But she still living ? " Forrest nodded , in the dark . " And you hunting her ? " The answer reached Forrest from wherever it had waited  --  or freshly burgeoned . In total dark it caused him no pain to give it to this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powerless to hurt . " No , I 'm not , " he said . " I am heading home . " Banky said , " I 'm there . And I 'm ready to sleep . You welcome to sleep in my poor home . " He waited , then cackled with laughter awhile , then bowed from the waist toward where Forrest sat , then entered the black house . T HERE WERE TWO LARGE ROOMS on the front of the house , the old public rooms . When Forrest stood and followed Banky indoors , he found him waiting in the hall , hand extended  --  found him with his own hand in the unrelieved dark . The dry old skin gave a rustle at his touch ? hide of a rattler , dragon , hermit ; the skin of all Negroes he had ever touched , the tough lov ing cooks ( spiteful and tender ) of his own childhood  --  but he did not refuse it ; and Banky said , " You ready ? " Forrest gave a nod that no human eye could have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  the center of that room  --  till his toes were stumped by a low soft obstacle . " This your bed . " Banky left him . Forrest squatted and felt at the mass on the floor  --  it seemed a pallet made of carpets or draperies ; dirt , vermin , he thought but did n't care . Again a huge weight , greater than fatigue , was pressing him earthward . So great even he did not struggle to see it to name it , discern its need , its diet . He loosened his high shoes and lay and sank . No fear . Surrender . After hours of pure sleep and lesser dreams , he came to this  --  he has walked for days , in familiar country , southern Virginia ( pine woods , rolling pastures , the trees and the air one enormous bell ceaselessly rung by millions of thirteen-year cicadas ) ; and now , tired but calm , he has come to a small town , a boardinghouse . He has signed his name in the book which the lady keeps by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but cool ; she is beautiful , a widow in her early forties , well-spoken , fighting with lovely and effortless grace to feed her children , herself , her servants by the hard expedient of opening her doors to a streaming world  --  he feels that in the dream ) . She leads him to a room on the back of the house , far from noise ; and once she has shown him the wardrobe and basin , she turns to go , then stops and says , " This bed is yours . " There are two iron beds , one large , one small  --  she has shown him the small . He does not ask why , only sets down his grip ( which by now he has rigged with rope , as a pack ) ; but she smiles and says , " You have paid for a room that holds two people . Now we 'll wait for the other . " Then she turns and goes ; and he does not see her , has in fact no life at all till evening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house a bell rings supper and he washes and goes . And has eaten a full meal steak , pan gravy , corn , snap beans , tomatoes  --  when the lady appears in the dining room door and , grave as a sibyl , searches the faces of his fellow feeders . It is him she wants . He knows that at once  --  there is someone behind her in the darkening hall  --  but he does not speak . A fellow guest  --  a young man at his right ? is asking him the purpose of his journey . As he offers his face to the lady 's search , he is also trying to answer the question , to remember the answer . Just when he knows and is ready to speak , the lady speaks also but not to him . She turns to the person waiting behind her and clear , ly says , " Mayfield  --  take the seat by Mr. Mayfield . " An elderly man  --  white hair in clean long locks to his shoulders , the clothes of a wanderer ( more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes , he studies only the floor , his shut ' ? fling feet  --  a careful mover , forced into care by . age and exhaustion . Forrest thinks he should rise to help the man ; but the young man beside him again asks the purpose of his lengthy trip ; so he turns and says , " My health  --  for my health , " and by then the old man is seated beside him . Silently . Breathing hard from his effort , the latest leg of his own long journey , but no word of greeting and no look , no smile . The old man faces only his plate , empty and white ; and when Forrest passes the coaling food to him , he serves himself in silence , staring down . The young man beside Forrest asks what is v , rong ? " You look quite well " ? but Forrest is openly watching the old man and knows , though he can not look up to check , that the lady stands on in the doorway , watching also . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and still she is grave , not from puzzlement but fear that something will not happen . It does . Then . The old man separates a biscuit into halves . He is For-rest 's father . Forrest sees it ; no question of doubt or error . He senses that the lady is also smiling . Forrest speaks the name " Robinson . Father . Robinson Mayfield . " The old man eats the biscuit slowly , still watching his plate . He does not seem hungry . He is eating because he has been led here where eating is expected . Yet when he has chewed it all and swallowed , he turns to Forrest , waiting with eyes from the morning which Forrest remembers ; but with this crushing difference : their gaze is no longer needy or searching , merely polite . He is trying to think of an answer for this stranger smiling beside him . No one but Forrest is waiting now ? all the others are eating blackberry roll ( it is mid-July ) ; the lady has gone . The old man  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for twenty-seven years , for whom he now yearns  --  that old man carefully says , " Forgive me . " He smiles . " Maybe so . You may very well be right . I am too tired to say . Too tired , too far . " Forrest does not wonder too far from what or why his heart yearns so fiercely tonight for the simple sound of his own name spoken in that old voice . He says , " Forgiven , " and turns to the food congealed on his plate . I IN- THE MIDST OF THAT ( at the point where Forrest heard the dinner bell ) , black Banky , . , ame to the door of the room and stood  --  no ight . Since leaving Forrest here , he had been o the kitchen to deposit their pan , then into the rreezeway to wash his feet , then back to the ' rout room opposite Forrest 's . He had sat in an armchair and tried to sleep ( he had not slept lot on his back for years  --  danger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinking : memory , faces he had hoped to see only in leaven ( he was certain of heaven , though afraid o go ) . So he 'd crossed the hall and listened for the sounds that would locate Forrest and , more , tell his nature  --  the secret signals of kindness or cruelty which . all his life , Banky had detected in darkness or light , near or far . He stood and listened till the end of the dream . There seemed to be sounds of quicker breath , two muffled blows of a fist on the floor ; but age had dulled the special keenness of his organ of knowledge ( that film of skin on his palms , in his nostrils , across his eyes , that received from the world  --  or had for eight decades  --  the urgent news : early warning or , rarely , confirmation of clear path ahead , invitation to safety , pleasure , rest ) ; and silence had taken the room again . So Banky moved slowly to enter the space . sliding each foot forward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body somewhere there asleep , afloat in its secret life , cast away . Banky thought some of that  --  and felt it all  --  and when he knew that his right foot had come to the edge of the body , he stopped and waited a little , thinking . The white man , covered in dark beneath him  --  in reach of all his organs of touch , his harmful instruments  --  seemed quiet again , entirely quiet . Banky slowly reached to his own hip pocket no fumbling now  --  and found his knife . He opened it silently and in one move , fluid and quiet as a snake no cracking of joints ? he knelt to the floor . His knees touched For-rest 's warm right hand where , abandoned in the dream . it lay open , empty . The knife was in Banky 's own right hand . He extended his left and with perfect aim inserted his forefinger , dry , and touched Forrest  --  lightly on the palm . Misery poured from the hand into Banky like the jolting current he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had just finished plowing  --  fifty yards away  --  and slammed through the damp earth to burn his feet . His finger moved on , still accurately , and stopped at the crest of the sleeping wrist where a pulse thudded up to meet him like cries , deep wide-spaced bellowing . He had not felt active pity for years , maybe since his mother lost her mind and raved ; but he felt it now and knew its name  --  and also thought he knew its demand . He drew back his probing hand , extended the other  --  the right hand armed with the open knife  --  and with no need to gauge his force or feel for his target , he pulled the sharp edge once across the wrist . Lightly though , a dry rehearsal . He felt again . The wrist was dry and in that instant of touch Banky knew he could not help this man , not give him the peace that lay in his power to render now . He drew back his knife , folded it , and hid it in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he would sleep and die unawares , he lay slowly back on the hard floor . Forrest was just beyond his reach  --  ten inches more than the length of his arm ; and to ease the morning , the strange awakening , Banky 's head was laid at Forrest 's 1 75 feet . At first light , Forrest would not have to wake to immediate sight of Banky 's eyes , open and waiting . E WOKE A GOOD TWO HOURS past dawn , not n from any external sound or movement or Banky 's nearness or the light full on him through the tall east window , but from satiation , a rest so deep and venturesome as to give him the sense , as his eyes broke open , of lightness and cleanness , of a life unburdened by past or future , all an open present like a cleared field in sunlight . A sense of healing that bore in its heart no threat to end . His dream had sunk beneath conscious memory , and the turbulence that rose from its plummet was hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way . And so he was happy  --  for twenty , thirty seconds . He had waked on his back and all he had seen till then was ceiling  --  the strangely intact , unstained white plaster twelve feet above . But Banky had waited as long as he could . When he heard the final sounds of waking , he quickly rose to his knees again and was there over Forrest ? " I 'm going with you . " Forrest looked . All the causes of misery stood in him , large and genuine , his respite ended . " Where am I going ? " he said . Banky smiled  --  the first time . " You say . I 'm following . " Forrest said , " Why ? ? " You by yourself now . You need some help , need somebody . I 'm free and ready . " Forrest said , " You 're hunting your mother . " " Did I tell you that ? " Banky said . " I was . When I came back down here , I thought I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I come straight here , found this . I knew it was the place ? somebody told me years ago the Fittses had sold out to some poor trash that had built this hotel and then gone broke . But before they left , they tore down all that was in my memory , except your springs and a tree or two I recognized . All the quarters was gone  --  my mama 's house , Dip her sister 's , the shop I forged in . Trees and foul water . So I walked on to Micro  --  I knew that good , ai n't barely changed  --  and asked this old white man in the store if he heard of Julia Patterson . He told me , ' Sure . Old crazy Julia . Lived back yonder with all them dogs . ' I ask was she live . He say he ai n't seen her for twenty years ; but he say , ' Do n't trust me . Heap of folks 1 ai n't seen ai n't dead , and some of ' em come back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I trust ; and he said , " Wo n't she a Fitts nigger ? Miss Caroline Fitts still living up the road . ' He tell me where ; so I go and there she  --  old as me. and meaner , and three-fourths blind ; but she knew me the minute she see my face . ' You 're too late , Banky , ' she say first thing . ' I 'm poor as you . ' It looked like she was , but she a bigliar . I say to her I ai n't here for money , but can she tell me where Mama is ? She say to me , no , as quick as that . ' When she die ? ' I say . Miss Caroline say , ' Who say she dead ? Maybe she living in the Washington White House , cooking angel food cakes for Teddy Roosevelt . Maybe she living in a shack near here with fourteen hounds , eating dirt and scratching . Either way , you 're no good to her now . Too late , Bankytoo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the crowd , Miss Caroline ; but she tell what her mouth think is so ; so I did n't backtalk none at all . I say to her , ' True . ' Then she say , ' Where you living ? ' and I ask her do she have a suggestion ? She say no again ; she quick as ever . I ask her , ' Who own that old piece of hotel where the house used to be ? ' She say , ' I do . ' I told her I heard the Fittses lost it . ' Did , ' she say , ' but the trash that bought it could n't sit there and work long enough to pay the mortgage , so it 's mine again . ' Then she study me hard ; then say , ' You want it ? ' I say yes  --  to see what she mean . ' Take it , ' she say . It 's mine to give . Take it , use it , and when you done , burn it . But do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or food . Do n't bring me your face another time . ' Then she shut the door . I swear to Cod  --  two weeks ago . " Forrest nodded . " I believe you . You 've got a grand home . " He smiled , waved round at the big bright room . Banky said , " This do n't mean birdshit to me . " Forrest said , " It does to me . " He had heard all that , half risen , arms propped behind him . Now he reached for his shoes and laced them on carefully . Then he stood and walked four steps toward the door ( nearer to the door than Banky , still kneeling ) ; then he turned and said , " I 'm sorry , Banky , and I thank you for kindness . I am going home myself  --  eventually , I hope .
