HEAVY TRAFFIC <P> Directed and Written by RALPH BAKSHI <P> Michael is a 22-year-old cartoonist who still lives with his parents in a grim flat on Manhattan 's Lower East Side . <P> His mother is a nightmare Yiddisher mama , a shrieking , swooping , loony harridan who plies her son with brimming trays full of food . Papa is a smalltime Italian hood who looks like an eggplant with a two-day growth of beard . <P> Mama and Papa war around him , but Michael stays safe from the battle by losing himself in his cartoons . <P> Such fragments of urban naturalism are littered all through Heavy Traffic . <P> Its novelty derives not from originality of insight but from the fact that virtually the whole movie is a cartoon . Animation has seldom been used to express purely personal experience . Heavy Traffic not only has an authentic tenement toughness but the rough feeling of unassimilated autobiography , of experiences and fantasies still keenly felt . <P> The movie is thus indebted less to Disney than to underground cartoonists like R. Crumb . Director-Writer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fritz the Cat , a feature-length film about one of Crumb 's most famous creations without any of Crumb 's clout . <P> Heavy Traffic is an improvement over Fritz , but it shares its scurrilous atmosphere and flair for capturing the surreal violence of the big city . <P> Animation lets Bakshi run free with arresting fantasies . When Mama and Papa battle , Papa lays Mama out with a haymaker ; Mama hurls a meat cleaver that catches Papa right in the crotch . <P> Michael 's sexual initiation on a rooftop ends with a brawl and the girl 's naked body dangling from a clothesline . <P> When the shock wears off , a few questions remain . Urban desperation is a familiar subject by now , and Bakshi 's private fantasies may be more startling than original . The film is a grab bag of drawing styles and animation techniques , some used once , then discarded , others used scattershot throughout , giving the whole picture the chaotic consistency of an experimental sketchbook . <P> Although none of the visual ideas are new , some , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ striking . Others are ostentatious . Michael , the Bakshi surrogate , is drawn with a cheap storybook realism while everyone else is grotesque . The hero looks like Snow White among the Seven Dwarfs , the kind of narcissism the movie not only indulges , but stresses . ? Jay Cocks <P> ? Ralph Bakshi tends to talk in manifestoes . " What I 'm doing to animation , " he proclaims , " is the same thing young film makers are doing to regular movies-cutting down budgets and gaining freedom that allows me to make the pictures I like . I want to do bang-out comedy . I also want to do The Penal Colony . " <P> The world will have to wait a bit for the first cartoon Kafka . Right now Bakshi is finishing " a homage to the black man " in the form of a collection of Uncle Remus-style tales called Coonskin . As in all animation work , progress is slow because each movement , no matter how imperceptible in the finished product , requires a separate drawing . " We turn out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bakshi , who disdains the larger animation outfits in town that finish a hundred or more feet a week by using fewer drawings per foot and settling for less lively results .
