In the Bible according to David Steinberg , Moses " saw a bush that was burning , yet it would not consume itself . A voice came out . ' Moses , take off your shoes from off of your feet , ' God said in his redundant way , ' for the land that you are standing upon is holy land . ' Moses takes his shoes off of his feet and approaches the burning bush-and burns his feet . God goes ' Ah-ha ! Third one today ! ' " <P> God may have laughed , but not the nabobs at CBS when Steinberg preached such a mock-sermon on the Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour three years ago . The network asked its affiliate stations to preview the show in order to determine if it was within the bounds of " good taste . " Later , after the Brothers refused to excise a second " irreverent and offensive " Steinberg sermonette , CBS canceled the series . <P> The incident might have made the diminutive ( 5-ft. 7-in. ) comedian a network pariah . But , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been born in the television age , " To everything there is a summer-replacement season . " This one finds Steinberg , now 31 , working for CBS again-as host of a five-week variety series filling in for the Carol Burnett Show . One of his guests will be Tommy Smothers , the man who is currently suing CBS for $31 million . Steinberg himself will be an anti-CBS witness in that case . Says he , savoring the irony : " It 's as though I 'm living in a David Steinberg situation . " <P> When Steinberg departs from religious motifs , his humor deals with the psychology , sociology and surrealism of modern life . As one of his show 's features he portrays an " existential psychiatrist " whose therapeutic sallies are interrupted by his own compulsive shrieking at vermin only he can see . <P> Skits seem to be Steinberg 's forte . In one he asked black Songstress Leslie Uggams her specifications for the ideal man . " I love a man who has a powerful chest , " she replied , and Steinberg stripped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Steinberg , like Moses , took the shoes from off of his feet . " And black , " she cooed . At that , Steinberg picked up his clothes and moped offstage . <P> Strange fruit from a man who once seemed destined to be a scholar of Hebrew literature . The son of a Winnipeg rabbi , Steinberg left home at 15 to attend high school in Chicago , then went to Israel , where he earned a B.A. in Hebrew letters from an institute for foreign students . Even then he had a happy-go-lucky attitude that put him at odds with his religiously zealous classmates . " I chased after girls , " recalls Steinberg , still a bachelor . " I was just normal , but around those students I must have come off like a Nazi . " <P> Steinberg then switched to the University of Chicago , where he studied for a master 's degree in English . He never got it , since his energies were diverted to acting in college productions . By graduation he was a mainstay of Second City @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nichols and Elaine May . " Then I saw Lenny Bruce , " Steinberg remembers , " and he was James Joyce on a nightclub stage-not just being a buffoon , but at the top of his intelligence . That influenced me.
