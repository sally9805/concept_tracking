Democracy depends upon the acceptance by the minority of the majority 's will , and most Americans acquiesce to election results with relative equanimity . Not so William Loeb , the ultraconservative publisher of the Manchester , N.H. , Union Leader . In the state 's gubernatorial election this fall , Loeb supported conservative Democrat Roger Crowley , hoping that a large voter turnout in Manchester would carry Crowley past the Republican incumbent , Walter Peterson , into the Statehouse . Crowley lost by 4,200 votes . Last week the Union Leader began publishing the names of the 15,000 Manchester voters who failed to show up at the polls . It is they , says Loeb , who cost his man the election .
