What is better than a good businessman ? Answer : a good lucky businessman . Charles Bluhdorn , the highly creative and sometimes abrasive chairman of Gulf &; Western Industries , is just that . In the 1960s he built G. &; W. into a prosperous conglomerate , piling one acquisition atop another , from auto parts to zinc mining . But along with many other conglomerates , G. &; W. foundered when tight money and recession struck a couple of years ago . Now Bluhdorn is making a comeback , lifted by a business where luck is a necessity : motion pictures . In his palmier days , Bluhdorn bought Paramount Pictures , lately the producer of The Godfather , which will probably be the biggest moneymaker in cinema history . <P> Bluhdorn is fortunate , because five years ago his Paramount executives bankrolled an obscure author , Mario Puzo , while he wrote The Godfather . Paramount got the rights to the screen version for a mere $80,000 plus 21% of the net profit for Puzo . Thanks to fine scripting , directing and acting , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ March 13 ) . Only eight weeks after release , it has grossed nearly $50 million. * By the end of G. &; W. 's fiscal year in July , The Godfather is expected to show a pretax profit of $10 million . According to industry experts , the movie may eventually earn $80 million in profits for G. &; W. At the same time , G. &; W. has another smash , Love Story , that will bring in an additional $16 million this fiscal year . Other promising films are in the works : a sequel to The Godfather , The Great Gatsby with Ali MacGraw , and , improbable as it seems , Albert Speer 's Inside the Third Reich . <P> Vienna-born Bluhdorn , now 45 and a bit thinner and grayer than when he was the wunderkind of conglomerates several years ago , expects that The Godfather will lift G. &; W. earnings close to their alltime record set in 1968 . The company is likely to report sales of around $1.6 billion and net operating profits of slightly under $68 million , up $ 13 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ G. &; W. 's Leisure Time Group its second most profitable arm . The company 's top moneymaker is Associates Corp . of North America , a finance and insurance subsidiary that brings in some 47% of the profits . Like other conglomerates , G. &; W. in the past propped up reported profits by taking advantage of liberal accounting rules . For example , in 1967-68 G. &; W. sold many of Paramount 's old films and recorded earnings from the deal as straight operating profits , instead of nonrecurring gains . But G. &; W. has not made such sales lately , and outside accountants who have read its recent financial statements say that the " quality " of its earnings is higher than in past years . <P> To revitalize the company , Bluhdorn has sold off unprofitable plants and cut staff . In addition , he says , " We brought in new top managers in almost every division . " G. &; W. is doing considerably better than several still troubled conglomerates , including LTV , Litton and Teledyne . Wall Street is taking notice . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mid-40s , way up from its 1970 low of $9.
