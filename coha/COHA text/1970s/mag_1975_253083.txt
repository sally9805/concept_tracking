A SEASON IN HELL by PERCY KNAUTH 111 pages . Harper &; Row . $6.95 . <P> <P> Whether they call it the blues , a case of the hoo-ha 's or " free-floating angst , " nearly everyone has wrestled with depression . Cures are various , and likely to be temporary : a cold shower , a new hat , pills , a chat with a doctor or a friend , or simply repeating to oneself that " tomorrow is another day . " Many people push a burden of inexplicable sadrtess through half a lifetime like Sisyphus with his famous stone , and try to believe that they are happy just the same . But when Author Percy Knauth fell into a depression , none of these things worked . <P> Knauth is a veteran correspondent , editor and writer ( the New York Times , SPORTS ILLUSTRATED ) . Returning from Europe a few years ago , he seemed , at 57 , to be sitting on top of the world ; he had a wife , a young family and a brightlooking future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yet he kept awakening ( if he managed to sleep at all ) with a sense of impending doom . <P> All day nameless dread dogged him so closely that he could not work .

It is not a new ailment ; doctors have known about it for centuries . But medicine has only recently learned how to treat it Merely telling a patient that his fears are groundless does no good at all . Conventional psychoanalysis is equally ineffective in most cases ; Knauth visited a Freudian therapist for six months without exorcising any of his personal demons . <P> Chemical Imbalance . A new class of drugs does seem to help . Doctors , as Knauth reports , have found that many depressed people have abnormally low levels of certain brain chemicals . Whether this imbalance is a cause of depression or one of its effects remains to be determined . What is known is that it can be corrected in some cases with drugs known as MAO inhibitors , which affect brain chemistry , not the progress of the People 's Revolution in China . Two weeks after he started taking MAO inhibitors , Knauth was able to function again . He took up his old editorial projects , wrote this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Association .
