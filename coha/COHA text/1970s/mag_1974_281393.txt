When Luther and Ida Aguchak failed to make payments on their new snowmobile and freezer , Montgomery Ward went into small-claims court in Anchorage , Alaska . A summons was issued and mailed to the Aguchaks , who live in a remote Eskimo village 500 miles away . Though they received the notice , the Aguchaks had neither the time nor money to make the $186 overnight air trip that was necessary to get to court . When they failed to appear to answer the summons , a default judgment was entered against them , and that seemed to be that . <P> Not quite . On the advice of a Legal Services lawyer , the Aguchaks sued , arguing that the action by Montgomery Ward violated the due-process clause of the state 's constitution . Last month the Alaska Supreme Court agreed . Noting that the U.S. Supreme Court has held that due process must be " appropriate to the nature of the case , " the Alaska justices unanimously concluded that the outlying areas of their state presented special problems . Indigent rural defendants , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but few of them would be near enough to a lawyer to get advice in time for a summons deadline . Thus the court ruled that the standard summons form must now tell the defendant of his right to request a change of venue to a court near him and of his right to send in his side of the story in writing if he prefers .
