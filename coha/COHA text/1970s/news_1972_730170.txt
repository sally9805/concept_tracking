txt In two years and a few months the first 1975 auto models will be paraded forth ? sleek , shiny , and environmentally clean . They 'll probably be powered by the same old gasoline-burning engines that have pulled cars for decades ? " internal combustion , " engineers call them . But stuck somewhere in every exhaust system will be a gadget called a catalytic converter . Its job is to get rid of most of two serious polluting components of auto exhaust ? hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide . The next year , when the 1976 cars debut , there 'll be a device which gets rid of the third deadly sin of auto exhausts ? nitrogen oxides . That 's the prospect now , in the wake of one of the biggest victories environmentalists ever have won in government . It was the weekend refusal of William D Ruckelshaus , administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) to agree to auto-makers ' requests and give them another year to rid pollutants from auto exhausts . These pollutants are a major cause of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cause . Best estimates are that nationwide some 40 percent of air pollution comes from cars . . A special study prepared for the White House found that in many large cities auto exhausts cause 90 percent of carbon monoxide , 80 percent of hydrocarbons , and 70 percent of nitrogen oxides . The last two are the major polluting ingredients in the smog that increasingly envelopes large cities . If the decisions by Mr Ruckelshaus are n't reversed or watered down between now and 1975 ? it is possible ' but not thought likely that they might be  --  the nation 's air-pollution problem ought to begin to diminish , for a while , once " clean cars " have begun replacing today 's " dirty " ones . // *Auto-exhaust ruling not enough ? // But experts warn this is only a short-term solution . If the population continues to rise and more cars per capita continue to be sold , even with these tougher auto-exhaust standards , the air-pollution problem likely will build back up again before the end of the century . Then , say specialists , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of internal combustion engines as- we now know them by somethig as yet undeveloped , or perhaps in some cars by the modern descendants of Grandpa 's Stanley Steamer . No controls reauired But for the next few years the standards Mr. Ruckelshaus has just upheld will help tremendously . The standards , which were established by a 1970 law , require that 1975 model cars emit no more than 10 percent of the carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons that 1.970 cars spew out . At present there are no controls required on exhaust emissions of nitrogen oxides , the hardest of the three to control . Relatively mild controls will begin on the 1973 model cars . Carmakers will have three years to develop a system ? to change most nitrogen oxides in exhaust into something else . And the 1976 auto models will be permitted to emit no more than 10 percent of the nitrogen oxides of the 1973 cars . Automakers complained to Mr. Ruckelshaus that they could n't meet these strict pollution-control requirements . But after 13 days of testimony he ruled that they had n't convinced him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exist for automakers . One is appeal to Congress to pass a new law watering down the pollution-control standards . Another is appeal to the courts . The third is presentation of stranger evidence to Mr. Ruckelshaus that auto exhaust ca n't be controlled that stringently that soon . He has said he ' would consider new evidence . In any case , most here expect automakers to continue working to meet the 1975 model requirements by using the gasoline-powered , internal-combustion engine , with pollutions turned into harmless vapors by the so-called catalytic converter . This is the principal effOrtbeing made by the " big three " American autonakersOne-of-them , already has ' made arrangements to buy platinum-coated converters for its 1975 autos ; it has provided a New Jersey concern with a $4.9 million guarantee to build two factories to make the converters . General Motors is working on the so-called Wankel engine , which some believe would be easier to " depollute . " But most here do not expect GM to put the engine into major production that fast , if at all . Engine modifications ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ using a modified kind of internal combustion engine ? called a stratified charge engine ? to meet the 1975 standards . Today 's internal-combustion engine works on the basis of a rapid series of explosions of a mixture of gasoline and air . By contrast , the stratified-charge engine has a continuous flame , or combustion ; it seems to be more efficient , for reasons not fully understood ? and to emit less pollutant . The stratified-charge engine is considered promising as a potential replacement for today 's engines . But it has not gone through anywhere near sufficient testing to be ready for use yet ; most doubt that it will be ready if ever ? before several years . Certainly , they say , not in time to meet the 1975 deadline . Testing thus far of the crucial catalytic converter has shown promising results . But converters have been unable to sustain their efficiency for the 50,000 miles that the law requires , as the longer the car is driven , the more it pollutes . Thus , in his weekend ruling Mr. Ruckelshaus said that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 50,000 miles . He said that one replacement of the basic element of the converter would be permissible ? in effect , telling automakers they need make it work only for 25,000 miles before replacement .
