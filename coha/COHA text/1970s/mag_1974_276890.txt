Long held in relatively low esteem by the U.S. public , Congress is now enjoying a new post-Nixon popularity . <P> Mainly because of the conscientious and dignified conduct of the House Judiciary Committee in its televised impeachment hearings , public approval of Congress climbed from 30% last April to 48% in August , according to a Gallup poll released last week . Overall , however , the Congress has not yet fully earned such a rise in confidence stemming from its handling of the Watergate scandal . It has yet to enact a single bill that would make future Watergate-type abuses of presidential authority and political campaigns less likely to occur . <P> Ironically , the freshening advent of Gerald Ford as President makes legislative-mandated reform seem less urgent . It strengthens those members of Congress who argue that decent leadership , rather than new laws , will best preclude more Watergates . Indeed , as Nixon and many of his men have ruefully discovered , there are many adequate laws that can be applied to specific Watergate transgressions . Yet , after its thorough study of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than 35 reforms , most of which would require congressional action . Explains Connecticut Republican Lowell P. Weicker Jr. , one of that committee 's most reform-minded members : " Ford is a fine man and I do n't doubt for a minute that he 's honest . But we have to go beyond this association with personalities and individuals and make this more a government of laws and less a government of men . " <P> Although there has been no final action on any Watergate reform bill , there has been a substantial amount of preliminary legislative activity , especially in the following areas of proposed reform : <P> CAMPAIGN FINANCING . A national disgrace long before Watergate , the solicitation and donation of political funds in a degrading climate of currying and dispensing governmental favors to special interests was dramatized by the cash-surfeited 1972 Nixon campaign . Probably the most urgently needed campaign-funding reform is also closest to some kind of congressional fulfillment . Both the House and Senate have passed bills that provide for full public financing of presidential general elections . Both bills also set limits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the House and Senate can spend , and both create more effective machinery to enforce campaign laws . There are , however , sharp differences in the two bills-most notably , the House fails to provide for any public funding of congressional campaigns-which will be considered by a House-Senate conference committee early this month . A more critical question is whether President Ford , who , like Nixon , has opposed public funding of political campaigns , will sign or veto the resulting legislation .
