Simultaneously , however , there were growing signs that Carter was in trouble with a startling array of prominent Americans , covering a wide spectrum of backgrounds and interests . The paradox is a fascinating and perplexing aspect of the new Administration . While winning such obvious broad support among Americans as a whole , Carter 's style and policies may also be alienating the leaders whose help he may need to reach the ambitious goals that he has set for himself and the country . <P> Labor leaders are outraged because Carter does not consult with them more often on economic policies and seems more worried about inflation than unemployment .
