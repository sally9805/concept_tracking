" Compliance with the mandatory system , which carres fines from $25 to $2,500 for violations , appeared to be good , although many dealers were relying on the honesty of their customers to observe the rule that prohibits sales when a car 's tank is more than half full . Compliance Emphasized - " I only asked the guys , " said A. Gattullo , owner of a Mobil station at Bay and Hannah Streets in the Tompkinsville section of Staten Island .
