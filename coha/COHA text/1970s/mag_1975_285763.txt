What has digested 50 million pieces of paper , chewed on 500 witnesses and has 38 legs ? Answer : the rival teams of lawyers appearing in court to argue the Government 's mammoth IBM antitrust suit . The largest such case ever to go to trial in the U.S. finally got under way in a New York federal district court last week , even bringing the usually officebound IBM chairman Frank T. Gary in to watch the opening session . Already , critics contend that the main thing the trial will prove is that the antitrust laws have become so complex to enforce in a modern economy that they are of little use in curbing business giantism . <P> The issues , to be sure , are important enough . One is a constantly vexing problem of antitrust law : how to define what " market " is involved . Raymond Carlson , 52 , the Justice Department 's chief lawyer for the case , contends that IBM controls a dominant 70% of the market for general-purpose computers and related equipment . IBM lawyers , led by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ General Nicholas deB . Katzenbach , reply that the true market in which the company competes is the much broader one for all kinds of electronic data-processing equipment , and that in any case a 70% share has not constituted a monopoly in previous cases . <P> Another issue : . How did IBM achieve its pre-eminent position ? The Government says it used predatory tactics . Barr retorted in court last week that the company 's success resulted simply from " better products , greater productive efficiency , better service , right judgments about the future at key periods of time and the willingness of management to back those judgments . " To support its claim that its triumphs have been based on quality , IBM is likely to call as witnesses purchasing agents of its biggest ( between $4 billion and $6 billion annually ) customer : the U.S. Government itself . <P> <P> The most impressive aspects of the case , however , are its complexity and the time it is consuming . Pretrial discovery proceedings took more than six years , during which a special crew had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sets each for the court , IBM and the Government ) and wound up delaying the trial for months when they bollixed the copying and collating . Chief Judge David N. Edelstein figures that the nonjury trial will end sometime in 1976 , and it might take him another year to reach a decision . Appeals could carry the case into the 1980s . And then , should IBM be judged a monopoly , comes the question of what to do about it . Government lawyers have asked the court to break up IBM but have not yet specified into how many companies of what size . In the event of a Government victory , wrangling over such questions will also add to the timetable . <P> Meanwhile , markets may change . <P> The Government has already filed two previous suits to trim IBM . Judge Edelstein supervised the 1956 settlement of the last such case and ruled that IBM should divest itself of or reform much of its electric accounting-machine division . But by then the business had changed so radically that IBM already was voluntarily moving out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jack Pearce , " had to sue the third time because the first two times did n't do it-whatever it was they were trying to do .
