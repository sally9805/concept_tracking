A DELICATE BALANCE <P> Directed by TONY RICHARDSON Screenplay by EDWARD ALBEE <P> A New England family : Mother ( Katharine Hepburn ) is a shaky queen who fills her days presiding over a wealthy household . Father ( Paul Scofield ) is a cultivated patsy . Sister ( Kate Reid ) is a puffy rummy who sweeps about in caftans . Daughter ( Lee Remick ) keeps ricocheting home after unsuccessful marriages . They all congregate in the heavily furnished rooms of the house , congratulate or chastise each other for the considerable amount of alcohol consumed , and make glum speculations on their neurotic lives . <P> Like its characters , Albee 's script - essentially the text of his 1966 play - is pompous , windy , arch ; it is a series of tableaux shaped out of crushed ice . <P> <P> Only when two close family friends appear ( Joseph Gotten , Betsy Blair ) does A Delicate Balance show some promise of interest . The friends seek refuge , having been driven from their home by some sudden , undefined , overwhelming fear . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Everyone gets to talk a lot about fear , death , honesty and devotion . The friends ' fear eventually evaporates for reasons not made clear . <P> Their presence has generated a series of uneasy confrontations , and as they depart , Katharine Hepburn is inexplicably moved to praise the psychic release found in sleep . " They say we sleep to let the demons out , " she proclaims . <P> There are no demons on these premises . What could have given A Delicate Balance a little resonance-nothing could have given it life-would have been some good , snarling , circusy dialogue . Instead there are a lot of labored epigrams that sound as if they came out of perfumed fortune cookies ( " Blood holds us together when we 've no more deep affection for ourselves than others " ) . In the prestigious cast , only Joseph Cotten manages to make something believable and occasionally poignant of his role . <P> This is the third in the series of eight subscription presentations by The American Film Theater , and it is the first to be betrayed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to give A Delicate Balance a cinematic flow is call upon the considerable talents of Cinematographer David Watkin . Having made that excellent choice , Richardson seems to have disappeared . Watkin uses a kind of embellished natural lighting . His uncluttered compositions can shock the eye with a shaft of light from a table lamp or lull it with a suggestion of the dark distances between night and morning . His craftsmanlike photography , at least , makes the film worth looking at .
