THE FIRST CASUALTY . From the Crimea to Vietnam : The War Correspondent as Hero , Propagandist , and Myth Maker by PHILLIP KNIGHTLEY <P> 465 pages . Harcourt Brace Jovanovich. $12.95 . <P> It is hard to believe that before Phillip Knightley took time out from his journalistic duties for London 's Sunday Times to write his history of war correspondents , the subject had lain underfoot like an undiscovered gold mine . The events are momentous . As for the correspondents , they are an irresistible assortment of idealists , artists , cads , hustlers , violence junkies and necrophiles . <P> Knightley 's lightly armed narrative charges from the Crimean War , where the modern techniques of reporting and censorship began , to Viet Nam , where television brought packaged blood and flame into the home and censorship was abandoned in favor of a massive public relations campaign to sell the war . Famous locations and faces flash by in Knightley 's 120-year extravaganza , but some things never change . In the correspondents ' rush to be first with the news , the truth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a government official gets around to asking a zealous reporter , " Whose side are you on ? " The journalist must then try to formulate a convincing answer out of his sense of professional responsibility , fear of losing his job , private prejudices , and not always flattering motives for chasing war news in the first place . <P> Richard Harding Davis ' pressure-cooked dispatches from Cuba , for example , were clearly calculated to inflame U.S. opinion and trigger the Spanish-American War that Davis ' boss , William Randolph Hearst , wanted . During the Boer War , the 25-year-old correspondent of London 's Morning Post , Winston Churchill , carried a Mauser pistol and played soldier . Twelve years later , as First Lord of the Admiralty , he was part of Britain 's censorship and propaganda machine . <P> Passions ran so high in the Spanish Civil War that many American correspondents joined the International Brigade . The New York Times 's Herbert Matthews defended his open partisanship on the ground that it would have been hypocritical to claim objectivity when he was certain that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Republican Spain . But he was able to see that the Stalinist left was as anxious to eliminate Spain 's independent left as it was to defeat Franco . <P> Some journalists at the time were not so open about their affiliations . Reporter Kim Philby was a Communist agent ( he defected to the Soviet Union in 1963 ) . Arthur Koestler also took instruction from Moscow and falsified atrocities . North American Newspaper Alliance 's Ernest Hemingway , by all accounts a mediocre correspondent , proved to be a dangerous nuisance as well . On at least one visit to the front he insisted on firing a machine gun toward the Franco lines . The result , reported one witness , was " a mortar bombardment for which he did not stay .
