Off duty , they arm-wrestle and break layers of bricks with a single karate-like chop . In battle they are fierce , frightening the peasants by the zeal with which they patrol their zones of operation , which are mainly in the central coastal region and include vital sections of Highways 1,19 and 21 . It is an area that is considered " hostile " ; much of it continues to be controlled by the Viet Cong . Even at this late date , the overextended South Vietnamese badly need the combat support of the ROK forces. * <P> As with other foreign troops , particularly the Americans , the Koreans ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and mistrustful relations with the Vietnamese . Rumors abound of incidents in which Korean soldiers brutalized the civilians - for example , by wiping out entire hamlets in retaliation for losing a single soldier to a Viet Cong sniper . One of the few incidents to be confirmed was in October 1969 , when eyewitnesses said that they saw uniformed Koreans enter a temple in Phan Rang and murder four Buddhist monks .

Beyond those simple facts , the events at Phu Long are disputed . The Koreans say that the civilians were killed in the artillery fire . But the villagers contend that they survived the battle by hiding in bunkers . After it was over , they say , Korean soldiers came into the village and murdered the 21 people . Tom Fox of TIME 'S Saigon bureau visited the province last week . " When they gather to tell their story , they speak with passion , " he cabled .
