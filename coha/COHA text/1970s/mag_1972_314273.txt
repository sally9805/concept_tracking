" I 'm more like a girl of 64 , " protested Britain 's grande dame of the theater , Actress Dame Sybil Thorndike . Actually , Dame Sybil had just turned 90 , and all Britain was helping her to celebrate . The post office arranged special deliveries every half-hour to handle the flood of greetings , and at London 's Haymarket Theater an all-star cast , including Margaret Leighton , Dame Peggy Ashcroft , Dame Edith Evans , Wendy Miller , Sir Ralph Richardson , Paul Scofield , Peter Ustinov and Lord Olivier offered their talents in tribute . As for Dame Sybil , who had begun acting in 1904 and was chosen by George Bernard Shaw in 1924 to play the title role in Saint Joan , she confided : " I would rather have been a pianist than anything else , but I was n't good enough . Standards are much lower in the theater . " <P> Pressing ever upward in his military career , Britain 's Prince Charles checked in for a brief refresher course at the Yeovilton Royal Naval Air Station @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and navy planes ranging from singleengine , two-seater training craft to more advanced jets , the Prince was ready for something new . In the co-pilot seat of a Wessex helicopter , he flashed a thumbs-up sign and with a rather wan look of determination clattered aloft . Afterward he went off to the R.A.F. flying school at Cranwell , where he graduated last year , and where he now plans to polish up his technique in various fixed-wing aircraft . Future projects : conquering the seas via minesweeper and frigate , and then , probably , his first command . <P> " It 's too bad that the State Department only has money to send us to our enemies , and not to our friends , " said Ballet Director George Balanchine after a five-week tour of the Soviet Union and Poland with his New York City Ballet . Looking back , Balanchine decided he preferred the warm , close-up Polish audiences to the cool , distant Soviet variety . " Soviet theaters were not theaters , just vast congress halls with the audiences well out of sight . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a present : an autographed piece of linoleum used by his company to cover the variable stage floors they danced on . The pleased Poles promptly sliced out the autograph and hung it in the Polish Ballet School for inspiration . <P> When Actress-Dancer Ann-Margret toppled off a 20-ft. stage set in a Lake Tahoe hotel seven weeks ago , it seemed her notably beautiful face might be scarred , her dancing ability impaired . But you ca n't keep a trouper down . While Husband Roger Smith autographed her cast , Ann-Margret announced through the wires holding together her fractured jaw that she will return to work at Las Vegas International Hotel a few days after Thanksgiving . The damage , though painful , turned out to be fatal for neither life , looks nor career .
