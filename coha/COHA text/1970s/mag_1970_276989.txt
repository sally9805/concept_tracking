Introduced with splashy promotion campaigns less than three years ago , enzyme pre-soaks like Procter &; Gamble 's Biz and Colgate-Palmolive 's Axion quickly became household words and laundry staples . Enzymes were then added to most detergents . Today , brands containing enzymes account for at least 60% of the $1.5 billion U.S. market for pre-soaks and detergents . Now , government officials in both the U.S. and <P> Britain are examining the enzymes for possible health hazards . <P> Official interest was first quickened by an article last June in the London medical journal , the Lancet , which reported that an unusually large number of workers exposed to enzyme dust at P &; G 's detergent plant in Newcastle suffered from asthmatic symptoms and skin irritations . Some dermatologists agree that enzymes , which split the proteins of stains made by chocolate , blood , gravy and other materials the way the stomach decomposes food , might also break down the skin 's fatty protective layer and cause inflammation , cracked skin and swelling . Though most specialists believe that more research is necessary before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Britons have complained of skin irritations caused by enzyme detergents . The Home Office two weeks ago announced a preliminary study of hospitals to determine whether a full investigation is warranted . <P> In the U.S. , enzyme cleansers are being investigated by three Government agencies . The Federal Trade Commission began a study in December to determine long-term effects of enzyme detergents . An official of the Environmental Control Administration , which is conducting its own study , says that complaints of rashes and asthmatic reactions received by his office have grown " astronomically " since the announcement of the FTC study . At the Food and Drug Administration , which is also investigating , a spokesman said that complaints have been coming in for 18 months and are increasing . <P> The big soapmakers-P &; G , Colgate and Lever-vigorously deny that there is a health hazard and produce a barrage of statistical evidence . P &; G pretested the effects of enzymes on the skin by applying patches smeared with detergent solution to more than 20 random groups of from 60 to 100 volunteers . The patches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and there was not a single case of skin irritation . Executives also say that they have all but eliminated enzyme dust in packaged goods . Just to keep the record clean , however , the soapmakers say that they intend to go right on testing their latest washday miracle . <P> Enzyme products have also been charged with polluting waterways . Last week a new indictment came from Entertainer Arthur Godfrey , whose avuncular endorsements for Colgate 's Axion are a major element in the pre-soak promotion campaign . " They call it an enzyme pre-soak , but that 's misleading , " said Godfrey , a dedicated conservationist . " They should say that it 's an enzyme-active detergent . "
