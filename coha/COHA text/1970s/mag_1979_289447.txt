Charges of overcharging <P> <P> For nearly two years , federal investigators have been probing overpricing in the oil industry , and last week they made their biggest charges yet . Even as the General Accounting Office was leaking a report criticizing the Department of Energy for foot dragging in its petro-probes of smaller middlemen , DOE was accusing seven of the largest oil companies of overcharging refineries by $1.7 billion since 1973 . The alleged method : selling petroleum at far higher prices than permitted under domestic crude-oil controls . <P> The major offenders , according to DOE , were Texaco , which is accused of some $888 million in overpricing , and Gulf Oil , with $578 million . Behind them came Standard Oil of California , Atlantic Richfield , Marathon Oil , Standard of Indiana and Standard of Ohio . <P> Rather than press criminal charges against the companies , DOE told them to refund the money , and gave the firms 40 days to appeal to an administrative law judge . Government attorneys fear that meeting the strict , " beyond a reasonable doubt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impossible considering the technicalities of the case . <P> The companies vigorously denied the charges and responded that they had simply been trying to abide by immensely confusing DOE regulations . At issue is the seemingly simple distinction between " old " oil and " new " oil . Under the price controls that Jimmy Carter will begin to phase out next month , petroleum discovered before 1973 can be sold only at a price that now averages $5.86 per bbl . More recently discovered oil fetches $13.06 per bbl . The companies are accused of selling the old oil to refineries for the new-oil prices . <P> DOE 's ever multiplying regulations have turned the distinction between old and new into a lawyer 's romper room . Complains an attorney for one of the companies : " The Government issues the regulations and leaves us to interpret them . Then the regulators sit down to decide what they meant in the first place , and they get as confused as we do . " <P> The DOE investigators say that the companies just played fast and loose in interpreting the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a now revised regulation stating that all petroleum pumped from a field that had even one well drilled before 1973 must be classified as being old oil . The idea was to stop companies from getting new-oil prices by drilling new wells into old reservoirs after 1973 . The companies are accused of , among other things , ignoring this provision whenever they actually struck new oil in an old-oil field . Instead of selling it as old oil , they are said to have charged top dollar .
