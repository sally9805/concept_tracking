Women 's mags close ranks <P> The November Cosmopolitan brims with the customary hints for foraging single gals ( " If you have invited someone to your home for sex ... it only takes a few minutes to change the sheets " ) . But it also carries some closely reasoned political advice : a 3,700-word article by Columbia Law School Professor Ruth Bader Ginsburg urging passage of the Equal Rights Amendment . To give the ERA cause a boost , Cosmo and 32 other women 's magazines from Ms. to Playgirl , from Vogue to House &; Garden agreed to run pieces about the amendment in their next month 's issue . <P> How each magazine handled the story was left to individual editors . Predictably enough , no one comes out against the ERA . Presentations range from perfunctory ( Playgirl devotes a mere 300 words in its editor 's column ) to intensely personal ( writes Essence 's editor in chief Marcia Ann Gillespie : " I did not stand up for my rights as a black person in America to be told that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . Ladies ' Home Journal has the most glamorous contributor in Senator Edward Kennedy . Also the most platitudinous : " The ERA will give meaning and vitality to the principles of social justice , economic rights and political equality . " <P> The group action , organized by Redbook 's male editor in chief Sey Chassler , is aimed at nudging some states closer to ratification-three more are required . <P> Even though the 33 magazines have a joint circulation of 60 million , one editor at least had few illusions about their collective clout , especially head to head with Opposition Leader Phyllis Schlafly . Says Cosmo 's Helen Gurley Brown : " All the women 's magazines together may not be as effective as Phyllis Schlafly with her rabble-rousing TV appearances . But we hope reason will prevail .
