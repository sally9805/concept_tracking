If there is one law in England and Wales that is dutifully obeyed , it is that all pubs and hotel bars should close at the appointed hours . It Is even unlawful for restaurants to serve wine with meals after hours . THE LICENSING laws are hard to explain , particularly if you are a tourist guide with visitors from countries where they have no such restrictions . Often , an English guide points out that although pubs close in the afternoon , there are liquor stores open all day . But just try to find one . In a typical London shopping street there were five liquor stores , but all were shut at exactly the same time as the pubs . " We may as well admit it , our licensing laws are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ British Tourist Authority said . " If people want to drink , they should be allowed to . The English and the Welsh should have followed Scotland 's example , " The Scots enjoy a ? drink , so Parliament gave pubs there the freedom to stay open all afternoon . All pub managers had to do was convince the local magistrate there was a " social need . " HUNDREDS OF taverns have been granted the necessary licenses , In the first few months of the new freedom it has been noted that just about the same amount of liquor was consumed during the longer hours as in the previous restricted period . " People can now take their time with their drinking , " said Harry Ewing , a minister at the Scottish Office . " Previously they had to drink up before 3 o'clock and in the process might have drunk more than they ought to . We have civilized our drinking habits . " The same situation could have applied in England and Wales , but Parliament has not found time to pass the new laws . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aware of the strong feelings of the temperance movement over any alteration of the law . So the government . appointed a committee to study the licensing laws to determine whether they should fall into line with those in countries where no such restrictions exist . For two years the committee held // Drinkers , beware England // hearings . Lawyers urged the committee to allow bars to stay open . Housewives ' organizations complained that too much drinking would have an adverse effect on family life . EVENTUALLY THE committee agreed to drop the restricted hours but only if the pub managers and their staff agreed . Members said the minimum age for being served a drink should be lowered from 10 to 17 . Britain , the committee said , also should have cafes where alcohol is sold . Another committee was appointed for Scotland , and its report said pubs should have flexible hours and the freedom to stay open .

But drinking was also a national past time , At the beginning of the century , the gin palaces did a roaring trade with a glass of the stuff costing only 2 or 3 cents . Drinking became such a problem that many Britons swore they would never touch a drop . At one time the Column 1 major temperance organization , the Band of Hope , had 2 million members , DURING THE war , workers in armament plants earned more money than ever before and this helped fuel the drinking habit . Factory owners complained to the government that employes were returning from lunch drunk and that this was hurting production . The wartime government took action . In the Defense of the Realm Act of 1915 , it was made an offense for bartenders to sell more than one pint of beer at a time to a customer . In this way , the British tradition of buying a round of drinks for friends was barred . Later laws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on drinking laws goes on . The Royal " College of Psychiatrists made a study of alcoholism and found that 300,000 Britons have a serious drinking problem . Each year hospitals treat 13,500 patients for alcoholism . Most of the managers and staff of the 74,000 pubs in England and Wales are content with the present laws . They say that the four hours in the morning and the five hours in the evening are more titan enough drinking time . They say their working day Is a long one and they deserve the two hours In the afternoon for relaxation .
