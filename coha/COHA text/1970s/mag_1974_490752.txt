Notes and Comment ONE of our occasional correspondents , an investment banker who spends much of his time in the country , has sent us an end-ofwinter report . " This was early last Saturday morning , " he writes . " I had just got out of bed and was putting on my robe when I heard the most ferocious squawking and screeching . It came from the back garden , where we have our bird feeder . I went over to the window and looked out . There were , as always , birds on the rim of the feeder , but the birds I heard were down on the ground , squabbling around a sprinkle of spilled feed . There were five or six of them , and they were doves . " Boycott S people who are concerned k -- / about the survival of whales set up tables and a mockup of a blue whale the other day in front of the offices of Aeroflot , at Forty-fifth Street and Fifth Avenue , in an effort to get signatures on petitions that would be forwarded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the two countries that wildlife groups consider the main culprits in the continued killing of species already severely endangered . The mockup was made of foam-core construction board and was about eight feet long . Beneath it was a sign bearing the same words that began the petitions ? " To the governments of Japan and the Soviet Union : we , the undersigned , hereby pledge that until you cease the killing of the Great Whales , we shall not knowingly buy a product from your countries , travel to your countries , or have any traffic with your countries . " Another sign read " Russia  --  Stop Killing Whales , " and bumper suckers that were on sale read " Save a Whale  --  Boycott Japan " and " Stop the Whale Killers . " We paused to talk with one of the young people who were taking signatures , and learned that he was David 0 . Hill , the executive trustee of the Rare Animal Relief Effort , which is known by its acronym , RARE , and which was sponsoring the demonstration . " This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the past three months , " he told us . " Till now , we 've concentrated on Japan  --  we did this same thing outside the Japan Trade Center , Nikon House , and Japan Air Lines . Today , we 're focussing on the Soviet Union . Right now , these two are the only countries that are still engaged in large-scale commercial whaling  --  the United States banned all whaling in 1971 . Along with the United States and eleven other countries , Japan and the Soviet Union are members of the International Whaling Commission , which sets annual quotas on whales , but now both Japan and the Soviet Union are reneging on their agreement and killing whales far beyond the quotas agreed upon . We 've been getting about a thousand signatures each time we 've demonstrated , and we plan to keep holding demonstrations every week until June , when the International Whaling Commission meets in London . Groups like ours have been taking similar measures in other cities , both here and abroad , and we think that if we can get a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and if the news gets to the economic interests of the Soviet Union and Japan , we may actually be able to make our point . In other words , we want to hit them where it hurts . " Mr. Hill handed us some literature , which explained that five of the eight surviving species of whales are in danger of becoming extinct . One handout included the grisly facts that over two million whales have been killed in the past fifty years and over thirty-seven thousand more , it is estimated , will be killed this year . Another handout stated that only between six hundred and fifteen hundred blue whales  --  the blue whale is the largest creature ever to inhabit the TOWN earth  --  are thought to remain alive , compared to some six hundred thousand before intensive hunting began , in the nineteenth century . According to one flyer ( and as wildlife groups have been saying for years ) , " commercial substitutes are available for all whale products at comparable or lower costs . " As we watched , a number of people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his colleagues , signed petitions , and gave contributions . A poster of a whale was available for two dollars , a lapel button for a dollar , and a bumper sticker for twenty-five cents . At one point , a man in a blue overcoat approached the card table at which Mr. Hill was sitting , signed a petition , reached into his pocket , and then frowned . " Listen , " he said . " I just got hack from Europe , and I 'm a little short of American money . I just wonder . Could I make my contribution for a button in  --  let 's see  --  in Dutch guilders ? " " I do n't see why not , " said Mr. Hill . The man reached into his pocket again , brought out eight coins , and placed them on the table . " I think you 'll find that I 've overpaid you , " he said . " But it 's worth it .

We did that just before the opening of the current exhibition , " A Tribute to Gertrude Stein , 18 741946 , " and found several members , in sweaters or shirtsleeves , busily pulling out of packing boxes , sorting on a long table , and arranging , more or less chronologically , all of the subject 's published writings . Many of the books were inscribed to such friends as Ernest Hemingway , F. Scott Fitzgerald , Sherwood Anderson , Katharine Cornell , and Picasso . Other books were inscribed to Miss Stein by frequenters of her Paris salon , at 27 Rue de Fleurus  --  a copy of " The Great Gatshy " inscribed " For Gertrude Stein with best wishes from Scott Fitzgerald , " and a copy of " Death in the Afternoon " with the words " A Bitch Is a Bitch Is a Bitch Is a Bitch " inked in a circle , and the inscription " From her pal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of photographs , including one of Miss Stein taken at the Rue de Fleurus in 1904 , shortly after she moved in , and one of Basket , her white poodle ; a Jacques Lipchitz bust of Miss Stein , and a Jo Davidson statuette , " which makes her look , " the poet Louise Bogan once wrote , " like Erda  --  or the miller 's wife , all done in and tired out with heaving the sacks she so much resembles ; " a group of miniature figures depicting the characters in " Four Saints in Three Acts , " the Stein-Virgil Thomson opera ; and a copy of her will . " The figures were made by Florine Stettheimer , who designed the scenery and costumes for ' Four Saints , ' and were lent by Columhia University , " Herbert D. Schimmel , who was one of the installers , and who had suggested the exhibit , told us . Other institutional lenders were Yale , whose Beinecke Library is the chief repository of Steiniana ; the Museum of Modern Art ; the Berg Collection of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Lilly Library , of Indiana University ; and the Rosenbach Foundation Museum , in Philadelphia . Most of the items were lent by private collectors , whom the Grolier keeps anonymous ( their names are invariably left off exhibition labels ) , but we were authorized to mention Mrs. Gertrude Stein Raffel , Miss Stein 's niece , who lent early family photographs ; Mr. and Mrs. Harold L. Knapik ( Mrs. Knapik was a close friend of Gertrude 's close friend Alice B. Toklas ) , who lent Miss Stein 's favorite vest ( a photograph of Miss Stein wearing it is on the invitation to the show 's opening ) ; and Robert A. Wilson , another of the installers and the exhibition 's major lender . Mr. Nilson turned out to be a transplanted Baltimorean , a Johns Hopkins graduate and a veteran of the Army and the Foreign Service , who since 1962 has been the owner of the Phoenix Bookshop , on Cornelia Street . " I was for six years manager of a MARCH 1 1 , 1 9 7 4 cuckoo-clock factor ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then I bought Phoenix . I began to collect Gertrude eighteen years ago . I collect anything by or about her  --  especially presentation copies . I keep the collection in my house , which is in Chelsea . My bibliography of Gertrude Stein will come out this spring . I never met her , but I did know Alice the last ten years of her life . " We looked at one of Mr. Wilson 's many loans two copies of the " Portrait of Mabel Dodge at the Villa Curonia , " which Miss Stein wrote in 1912 while visiting Mrs. Dodge in Italy . The author stayed up all night after a party to write it , and when she read it to Mrs. Dodge at lunch the next day , Mrs. Dodge was so delighted that she insisted on driving in to Florence , where she arranged to have three hundred copies run off and bought rolls of Florentine wallpaper for the binding . We next inspected a unique exhibit  --  Miss Stein 's small black Paris address hook , lent by the University of Texas . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Pierre Balmain ( who made suits for Gertrude and Alice ) , Louis Bromfield ( " Gertrude ... had not been particularly impressed with him or his writing , " James R.

One afternoon , at the rue de Ileums , she ... informed Alice that they would be having lunch , the next day , with Bromfield and his wife . Alice , puzzled , had asked why . ' Because .

We turned to a partly filled exhibition case and looked at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ score of the ballet " A Wedding Bouquet , " opened to a page that read " Music by Lord Berners . Words by Gertrude Stein . First Performance April 27 , 1936 , at Sadler 's Wells . " Miss Stein 's text starts out , " Any name of which one has known as least two Josephine Ernest Therese Julia and Guy and Paul and John . " " When we first began to plan the show , " Mr Schimmel said , " I was staggered to find how many Gertrude Stein titles were still in print . The younger generation of students has rediscovered her . She 's more popular with undergraduates now than she was in her lifetime . " Double Dutch BEFORE New York 's first Double Dutch Skip Rope Championship Finals got under way at Intermediate School 10 , on West 149th Street , we talked with Twana Hardman , age eleven , who is a dynamite Double Dutch skipper . Twana had just shown up Pia Lindstrom , the television newswoman , who could n't even get in between the fast-turning ropes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tries for her cameraman before she gave up . Twana made one businesslike try and jumped until the cameraman said she could stop . We asked Twana and a couple of her friends if they used any little ditties while they jumped . " Sometimes they say Get it , Twana , get it ! ' " Twana said . " Or ' Hit it , Twana , hit it ! ' " a friend added . " Any others ? " we asked . " Yes , " said Twana . " Sometimes I do ' Ice-cream soda with a cherry on top , tell me the name of your sweetheart . ' " After talking with Twana , we went and talked with Miss Maria DeJesUs , the coach of the seventh-grade team from the Manhattanville Community Center . " Now , there are three categories , " Miss DeJesiis said . " There is the speed category . There is the compulsory category ; that 's got a few tricks involved  --  jumping on one foot , and so on . And there 's the freestyle category , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We talked with Phyllis Timmons , a member of Miss DeJestis 's team . We asked Phyllis if she used any little ditties while she jumped . " I do Jack be nimble , Jack he quick ' sometimes , " Phyllis said . " I do a high jump when I do that one . " " And ' Ice-cream soda with a cherry on top , ' " a teammate added . " I do n't do ' Ice-cream soda , ' " said Phyllis disdainfully . The championship finals began with a few speeches . Vy Higginsen , the disc jockey , who , along with two police officers , had got the Double Dutch tournament going by hustling some montl out of Royal Crown Cola , said that the jumpers were jumping for the world championship . " You arc the world 's first , " she said . " I never heard of any other Double Dutch championship . " Miss Higginsen handed the microphone to a husky young man " Counters , are you ready ? " the young man began " Floor judges , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ladies . Start out at dead rope . " Squash for All HE equivalent of Double Dutch skip rope for grown-up lawyers and brokers who went to awfully good schools is a game called squash racquets , which involves hashing a little rubber hall around the walls of a boxlike white room with a racquet the size of a very large lollipop . Squash  --  the game is usually called by its first name is a sort of three-dimensional , strenuous billiards , with overtones of tennis and handball . It 's fast the ball comes rocketing off the wall at a hundred miles an hour if it is hit hard enough and it 's as much fun to play as any game we know of . Up to now , squash has been played almost exclusively in men 's private clubs that have membership requirements wholly unrelated to one 's enthusiasm for squash ( one may have to have attended a certain university , for example ) and that charge annual membership fees far in excess of the average worldwide per-capita income . The result has been to give squash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inclination than by right of birth . Last week , we paid a visit to an establishment that may well turn out to be the first tremor in a Leisure Revolution that will put squash courts in every shopping center in the country . The Fifth Avenue Racquet Club ( the name is the poshest thing about it ) occupies the eighth floor of a loft building a block south of Lord &; Taylor . The membership requirements are the same as for a library card  --  the ability to write one 's name . Dues are fifteen dollars a year , and it costs from five to seven dollars , depending on the time of day , for two people to play for half an hour . ( Half an hour on a squash court is enough time to get an hour 's worth of exercise . ) The Fifth Avenue Racquet Club is open from seven in the morning till eleven at night , including Saturdays and Sundays . John Copelin , whose architectural firm designed the club , took us on a tour of the facilities . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ T-shaped hallway , two to the right , and three at the end . The walls of the courts are made of concrete block covered with urethane and a hardwood panel  --  a combination that yields a true bounce . Mr. Copelin pointed out some of his favorite details : cutouts near the top of the court walls , which admit natural light ; meta catwalks , which lead to galleries overlooking five of the courts ; sauna baths in the locker rooms . The Fifth Avenue Racquet Club has a lounge with comfortable blue chairs , a charcoal-gray carpet , vending machines for snacks and soda pop , and backgammon tables . One of the courts has a glass wall , which makes it visible from the lounge , and we watched Stuart Goldstein , the club pro , play a fast game with Philippa von Berg , a willowy blonde . When Miss Berg came out , she told us that she is a ranked women 's player in Nairobi , Kenya , where she has spent most of the past six years . When she arrived in New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things she did was to try to find a place to play squash . " I rang up the New York Athletic Club , " she said . " I 'd seen it in the movies , in ' Love Story . ' They said , ' We do n't allow ladies to play . ' " The Fifth Avenue Racquet Club does allow ladies to play . ( What is even more revolutionary , it allows children to play . ) We got into sneaks and shorts , and took a lesson from Mr. Goldstein in the glass-walled court . Mr. Goldstein , who is twenty-three , is a former Stuyvesant High School tennis star and All-American intercollegiate squash player . He has a square jaw and shoulder-length brownish curls . He looks as if he might have sung with The Doors . Mr. Goldstein gave us one or two tips that resulted in an immediate , dramatic improvement in our game . Afterward , he told us that he likes squash a lot more than tennis . " Squash is so much quicker , so much more dynamic , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ squash . It 's all vector analysis  --  you have to calculate resultants . I know it sounds corny , but the most important thing is to keep your eye on the ball . " Happy , Hemispherical Birthday WE jetted out to the Coast the other weekend for Dr. Robert E. Ornstein 's birthday party . Fabulous party . Dr. Ornstein is the author of " The Psychology of Consciousness , " and he was turning thirty-two . He lives in a seventeen-room , pre-earthquake house in Los Altos , a town about forty miles south of San Francisco . He has almost three acres of land , which is unusual for Los Altos , where the groves and parks have been mostly broken up . He also has a sauna , a pool , and some seventy-year-old rosebushes . We took along some of the fine New York things to eat that the people out there just ca n't get adequate versions of : half a Pizza Rustica from the Italian Food Center , at Grand Street and Mulberry ; a couple of smoked mozzarellas from Alleva , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; two cream-cheese cakes from the Jon Vie Pastry Shop , on Sixth Avenue between Twelfth and Thirteenth Streets . ( We brought back twelve pounds of Barhi dates from De Martini 's Orchard , in Los Altos  --  a fine thing to eat that people back here ca n't come by . ) Dr. Ornstein 's presents included a three-speed bicycle in shimmering green ; a two-thousand-year-old Egyptian scarab ; a T-shirt that said " Know How Workshop ; " an hour of massage at the Ali Baba Massage Studio , on El Camino Real , in Palo Alto ; a twoyear-old peacock ; and fifty pounds of peacock feed . Dr. Ornstein named the peacock Hertel , but we thought he did n't really want it very badly . Peacocks can live to be twenty years old , and they go " THAW-houutmunnh " at the slightest provocation . There were waves of food at this party , which lasted quite some time : roast lamb , paella loaded with fresh shrimp ( cooked by Dr. Ornstein himself ) , a ham glazed with mustard and port , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Consciousness " and had on it , in honor of Dr. Ornstein 's research on the different ways the halves of the brain think , a pink icing cross-section of the hemispheres of the brain . There was also a chocolate cake , baked by one of the guests , name of Oona , which we dubbed Oona 's Curare Chocolate Cake , because it was , although delicious , so rich that after one bite we experienced paralysis of the motor-nerve endings of our striated muscles . There were also quite a number of guests at the birthday party . There was a telegram from the English journalist Pat Williams : " HAPPY , HAPPY , HEMISPHERICAL , HEMISPHERICAL , BIRTHDAY , BIRTHDAY , LOVE , LOVE , PAT . " There were two cats  --  a brown one , named Annie Chocolate Pudding ( a present from the novelist Anne Zoltan ) , and a calico one , named Bean Spasms . There was Fred Bjork , a Palo Alto stockbroker , and his wife , Nancy . There was Nancy Hendrick , Dr. Ornstein 's assistant , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Idries Shah called " Tell Me a Story . " There was Don Winsberg , who came in a van equipped with a shower , a Sony TV , a stereo , and an oven . ( The Curare Chocolate Cake was baked in this oven . ) He had with him a certificate that he had won a few days before in a restaurant in Amarillo , Texas , by eating a seventy-two-ounce steak ( that 's four and a half pounds ) in under an hour . In addition , there was Pamela Mae Tooth , who is working on a medical-research project at the Langley-Porter Neuropsychiatric Institute , in San Francisco , on the effects of marijuana . The subjects of this experiment smoke government-made , Virginia-grown marijuana cigarettes . The psychoactive ingredient in the cigarette is called **28;4719;TOOLONG . There was Faith Louise Hornbacher , graphic designer , co-author of a new book for ? ? home and office on how to take care of yourself called " An Everyday Guide to Your Health , " and practitioner of a system of body work called Rolf/Aston @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just started a company called Hornbacher &; Company Graphics . We asked her whom Hornhacher &; Company consisted of , and she said , " Me . I thought if I called myself Company people might see my activities as more unified . One ca n't be fragmented for one 's entire life . I would have been Hornbacher Inc. , but I have a cousin who 's that , so I thought I could n't do that . So far , I 've done illustrations for medical journals , designed letterheads , books , and a **37;4749;TOOLONG bookplate . I 'm interested in making the things that I surround myself with a positive force in my life . If I have a chair , I do n't want it to he just ' a chair . ' I want it to be a chair that speaks to me in some way . " Furthermore , there was Dr. David Galin , a physician and researcher , who is Dr. Ornstein 's collaborator ; his wife , Bronni Galin , who is studying clinical psychology ; their young daughters , Pauli @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and David Stuart Sobel , the other co-author of " An Everyday Guide to Your Health " and a medical student-on-leave , who is now writ-Mg a hook called " Ways of Health . " Sobel was thumping a new official National Football League football in his hands much of the time . He said , " I was at medical school , and I was beginning to learn a lot about disease when I realized I was n't being taught much about health . So I began to explore other systems of medicine , and I began to see that contemporary Western medicine is just one specialization that developed along a certain line , and that there are other , complementary lines that place greater emphasis on health , on preventive medicine , on treatment of the whole person . We 're only beginning to see in this culture that people can he taught to take responsibility for their own health . " Finally , we cornered Dr. Ornstein , poolside . He was pla ) ing a vicious game of Ping-Prang with Miss Tooth . He was also humming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm very busy , " he said to us after being demolished by Miss Tooth . " Very busy . I do n't know if I told you , but we are also celebrating the publication of my new hook , The Nature of Human Consciousness , ' which Viking is bringing out next week . It 's a hook of readings designed to accompany ' The Psychology of Consciousness ' ? which is going great guns , by the way -- -and to take anyone interested in the ideas in the first hook to their sources .

The hook will he called ' Common Knowledge , ' and The Real World is publishing several installments of it . I met Idries Shah last September , when I was lecturing in England , and told him about this project of mine . He said it sounded like a cute idea , but would I ever be able to find enough material ? So I asked him if I could look at the cop ) of Time he had with him . And I opened it up to page twelve , and there was this : Fred P. Shields , 73 , spotted a nest of copperheads one day last week in the 80-ft. well on his farm in Cheshire , Ohio , so he enlisted his 42-year-old son Fred D. and his 18-year-old grandson James to help kill them . They attached a hose to the exhaust pipe of their pickup truck , stuck the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . After a while , Shields lowered himself into the well to see if the snakes were really dead . When he failed to come out again , his son went in after him . When the second man failed to come out , the grandson went in . Rescuers from the sheriff 's office retrieved the three men , all dead , apparently of carbon-monoxide poisoning , but they found no sign of any snakes . Shah said he was convinced . "
