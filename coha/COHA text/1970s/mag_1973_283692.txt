THE PRESIDENCY <P> At the end of the year around the White House , dtente has a second meaning : harmony between Pat Nixon and the kitchen . Last week relations were superb . Assistant Chef Hans Raffert fashioned a two-foot-high house out of 16 pounds of gingerbread , mortared it together with six pounds of icing , shingled it with five pounds of cookies , and decorated it with gumdrops , a pound of hard candy and a dozen peppermint canes . An embassy child stood spellbound before this creation , reached out and broke off a piece of the front and popped it in his mouth . <P> When snow settles on the South Lawn , foreign policy is nothing so much as our relationship with the North Pole . <P> Last week S. Claus was loose in the corridors where diplomats and admirals usually stride on their awesome missions . Mr. Claus , otherwise known as Sandy Fox , head of the graphics and protocol office in the East Wing , has a good jolly ho , ho , ho . He carried a string @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his prestigious errand from the East Room to the North Portico . Sandy has been the White House Santa since the Kennedy days ; he has pieced together a flawless costume and has grown a real white mustache that can not be pulled off . His tummy is the creation of his daughter Debbie , who glued together several pieces of foam rubber and sewed it all up in red cotton for the benefit of the republic . <P> About a dozen of the young ladies who really make the White House run decided that a snowman was needed to brighten the South Lawn . During their lunch hour they went outdoors and formed an assembly line . The snow would not pack , so they got buckets of water , sloshed it around , and produced a handsome fellow at least six feet tall . <P> At first he faced down the lawn toward the Washington Monument . The girls wanted the children who were coming for the party to see a smile , so they made another face on the back of the snowman . Julie Eisenhower got her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother to pose for pictures . <P> It is an annual marvel that the White House melts so beautifully into human form at this time of year . The gears of state slow , the political combatants quiet down-ever so slightly . There is much to savor . Billy Graham preached at a Sunday morning service in the East Room ( " In the midst of all this chaos and crisis comes the message of Christmas , with all of its hope , good will and cheer " ) , and the soaring strains of Joy to the World and Mary Had a Baby rang out from the Army chorus . The White House staff , from lawyers to clerks , came together in small warm groups to nibble Christmas cookies and sip some eggnog . Nixon showed up briefly . <P> This week , on Thursday and Friday nights , the staff will dim the electric lights in the public rooms of the mansion . In their place , dozens of candles will be lit . Oak fires will be kindled in the eight fireplaces , and the President and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in . In the soft light one can stand for a moment and ponder where we have been and wonder where we are going .
