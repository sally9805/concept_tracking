by James Flowers ith the sound of a thousand quail being flushed the olive-green helicopter nestles down gently on the well-manicured grass near SHAPE ( Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe ) , Belgium . Minutes later , with the rotors still turning , a solidly built officer with four stars on each shoulder strides briskly toward the big bird . His aide , a major , keeps pace carrying a large Manila envelope . Before one can say " That 's a neat way to go , " the dark green bird lifts easily , gains altitude , and whirls away with its VIP passenger , General Alexander M. Haig , Jr. , Supreme Commander of Allied Forces in Europe . General Haig could be on his way to a NATO meeting in Brussels ; or to nearby Chievres Air Force Base where his private aircraft waits to jet him to a conference ; or to a one-on-one meeting with a Western European leader . It might be Germany , Portugal , Norway , Turkey , England , or any one of the 15 Alliance nations . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 54 on December second , maintains a grueling schedule . A recent visitor from Congress , observing the general in action , shook his head in wonder and said , " If a campaigning politician in the States had to set this pace , he would beg for mercy ! " The very nature of the job calls for a furious pace and instant decisions . Heavily guarded and tightly secured , SHAPE is the military nerve center of the 1.5-nation NATO Alliance . The vast complex houses a military and civilian mix of 12 nations  --  Belgium , Canada , Denmark , the Federal Republic of Germany , Greece , Italy , LuxemNow in his fifth year as Supreme Commander of Allied Forces in Europe , Alexander Haig is credited with bringing new optimism to the NATO Alliance . bourg , The Netherlands , Norway , Turkey , the United Kingdom , and the United States . In 1966 , France withdrew from the integrated military structure , and a year later SHAPE moved from outside Paris to its present site near Mons. Iceland and Portugal belong to Allied Command @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than 2,700 . Including other personnel and families , it is a community of over 10,000 people . Only seven men have occupied the military hot seat of Supreme Commander since 1950 , all American generals . ( The first was General of the Army Dwight D. Eisenhower . ) To reach the office of Alexander Meigs Haig , Jr. , the man currently directing operations , I had to sign a register at a front guarddesk and turn in my passport ( to be picked up on leaving ) . Before an identification badge is issued , a " big brother " escort , an Army lieutenant colonel , must proffer his signature as well as mine in order to endorse me . Safely through ? No . The colonel leads the way up-stairs and down a long hall . An-other security desk blocks the way . The restricted area is be-yond . A tough-looking guard checks the colonel and his identification . Then , with a protracted stare , he studies me and my identification  --  as if I were the international spy they have sought for years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , halfway down another seemingly endless hall the colonel ushers me into the Supreme Commander 's office . It is spacious enough for a " war room " ; but , no , that would have to be further down the hall in an even more restricted area . General Haig is a handsome man , cordial , cooperative . Striding across the large room to greet me , he looks and moves like a college halfback . ( He did , in fact , play for the Army service team in occupied Japan after World War II . ) Sitting on angled sofas in a room corner in front of a coffee table , the general chain smokes and chats informally , then listens intently to the questions . What about the long hours day after day in a sensitive pressure cooker ? General Haig fixes me with steady blue eyes and smiles faintly before answering . " Well , I will not complain about being bored , " he says . " The pace here is not an unfamiliar one ; it 's similar to my five years as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the White House , with Defense Secretary Robert McNamara and , at the time , Deputy Secretary Cyrus Vance , which spans some 15 years of fairly high level political-military experience . " And what about running President Nixon 's staff ? " Same pace , period , " replies General Haig evenly . And here ? " There is , if anything , greater variety in the challenges here , and in some respects fewer rather than more frustrations . I suppose I 've been called a work-aholic . I do n't believe I am ; I have the same lazy instincts as most . . .. " The General pauses to light another cigarette and , behind a cloud of smoke , smiles the smile of a private joke before continuing . " One of the great critics of the military mind once suggested that a certain degree of laziness is helpful to a commander . " * * * SatEvePost : Not long ago an Associated Press/NBC News Poll showed that 45 percent of the American people believe the Soviets are now ahead of the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on this . General Haig : In that context , we have put together a rejuvenation program this past year that involves a number of improvements in our military capabilities  --  and a greater integration of multinational efforts . We 've gotten a consensus for increased spending at a rate of three percent real term increases every year for the next five years . Yes , of course , there is a new sobriety with respect to the Soviet threat , and we have launched programs that are designed to reverse these dangerous trends , which , thus far , have not been properly tended . But we must not delude ourselves that correcting our deficiencies in NATO Europe will solve the problems we are most likely to face in the period ahead . SatEvePost : The primary objective of NATO 's power is to act as a deterrent . How long can this deterrent last if we do not reverse the Soviet arms build-up ? General Haig : I 've made the point repeatedly that deterrent is still viable today ; but if the Soviets continue increasing their allocation for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or decline  --  as we have been doing until this year  --  then by the early 1980 's our deterrent will no longer be viable . SatEvePost : Has anyone figured out Soviet intentions behind this massive arms build-up ? And have Western leaders , somewhat lulled by the hope of d  --  tente , miscalculated on our build-up ? General Haig : I think we were all somewhat lulled in the early period of cl  --  tente . There was a tendency to view d  --  tente as a substitute for strength and unity . There has been concern in Western Europe for some time about Soviet global activity and internal policies . The growth in Soviet power  --  which exceeds the needs of the Soviet Union for purely defensive purposes  --  is , indeed , worrisome and will continue to be . Intentions ? I have to worry about Soviet capability ; I 'll let the politicians worry about intentions . But I do agree with NATO Secretary General Joseph Luns who said that the question of Soviet intentions is irrelevant because they could change with incumbencies or international @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between East and West . And there will be confrontation as long as these differences remain . SatEvePost : Speaking of incumbencies , the Soviet leadership is aging , and Mr. Brezhnev is possibly ill . Would a changing of the guard at the top affect present policies ? General Haig : This is very speculative , and I think it 's dangerous to overly rationalize . There is no reason to assume that the Soviets will not be able to continue their policies if a change in leadership occurs , which means Russia will maintain superpower status with global military capabilities . As a matter of fact , I would anticipate that new Soviet leadership will bring increased self-confidence . Looking at the projections of Soviet force improvements in any sector  --  nuclear , conventional , naval power  --  we see that these plans and programs are going to continue . SatEvePost : How much do the Soviets commit to their military Alliance ? General Haig : In a 15-year period prior to last year the Russians were increasing their defense spending each year by three to four percent in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their gross national product to defense . Think about that for a moment . Today , they are turning out high quantities of high quality third and fourth generation military systems . The ability to spew out this sophisticated material has enabled them to build up their forces facing Western Europe and simultaneously build up to 45 divisions facing Communist China . SatEvePost : Do the 45 Russian divisions deployed against China relieve some of the pressure here ? General Haig : Not at all . Actually , they have given priority to improvements facing Western Europe with the first models of new equipment . Also , the Soviets have steadily increased their manpower here in the last five years , with a substantial modernization in the forces . SatEvePost : What about the multinational military maneuvers you hold here every year . Have they been successful ? General Haig : Yes , they have been highly successful . We call these exercises " Autumn Forge , " and this is their fourth year . At first there was a lot of skepticism among the member nations . But since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the concept was to exercise in peace under a common Allied Command Europe scenario in multinational configurations . It all started rather cautiously with some 21 or 22 exercises . This year we were well over 30 . In 1977 we exercised 2,000 aircraft and a million and a half men ; this year we exceeded that number . The exercises have definitely brought us together more effectively . SatEvePost : Concerning the Third World problems , please comment on the Soviet influence in Africa . General Haig : Soviet involvement in Africa today , which projects their power 2,000 miles from the Russian homeland , is , indeed , of great concern . It reflects a steady expansion of Soviet naval capabilities and influence , which poses a new threat to the Western industrialized world in relation to raw materials , energy , and other assets the Third World  --  the developing nations  --  controls . The Soviets are exercising this naval power in many places : in the Straits of the Bosphorus and the Dardanelles , in the Kola Penisular area , in Arctic water , in the exits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pacific fleet . The reality of the Soviet activity in Africa today  --  which could appear in the Middle East and Asia tomorrow , and has already in some respects  --  is a phenomenon which the West can not afford to ignore . For not only must we be concerned about long-term viability of Soviet influence , we must be equally concerned about the short-term implications of increased Soviet presence  --  bases , arms , and proxy states  --  in key strategic areas , globally . If , in the short-term , these assets will enable the Soviet Union to choke off vital supply lines and strategic lines of communication for the West , if only for a brief period , it could be fatal to the Western world , which is increasingly dependent on these lifelines . SatEvePost : What impact has the deferral of the neutron bomb decision had on plans to modernize in the European theater ? General Haig : Clearly , it would have enhanced our short-range defensive theater nuclear capability , especially against mass armored formations . The issue itself developed political and psychological connotations in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This added significance is the most important Continued on page 128 General Haig continued from page 54 aspect of the decision the President will have to make in the foreseeable future . SatEvePost : Are you satisified with the pace of progress in theater nuclear modernization programs ? General Haig : Although we have done a great deal in the last ten years to improve our nuclear theater capabilities , as we measure them against those of Russia and its satellites it is clear that we have some additional measures that must be taken  --  especially in long-term , long-range , and middle-range theater missile capability . SatEvePost : When you mention the nuclear capability of Russia and its satellites , I assume you mean the Soviet SS-20 missile . Please comment on this . General Haig : This system that is being deployed today by the Soviet Union  --  and there are a number of systems already operational  --  threatens all of Western Europe . The SS-20 has a 2,000-kilometer range and a multiple warhead , ballistic and mobile . It is therefore invulnerable to rapid countertargeting . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Soviet Union . SatEvePost : Does our cruise missile provide part or all of the answer to Western needs ? General Haig : I 've made the point that the cruise missile is not the answer to a maiden 's prayer . There are a number of uncertainties associated with cruise missile technology : It is not ballistic , and because it is air-breathing it takes considerably longer to arrive from launch to target ; in that context , it is not a one-for-one trade-off for the SS-20 missile which the Soviets are deploying in increasing number . It is an answer that , combined with several other possibilities , must be considered . By other possibilities I include ballistic systems of longer range than those we now maintain , air-launch systems , and offshore systems , perhaps submarine-launched . SatEvePost : Is the all-volunteer United States Army working ? And will you comment on the regulars and the re-serves ? General Haig : In the context of the total force , there are clearly problems developing with the all-volunteer structure . We 're short some 500,000 today in our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and active . The strength levels of our organized Reserve and National Guard are below what they should be for a host of reasons , not necessarily attributable to the shift from the draft to the all-volunteer system . Generally , morale is up and court-martials and disciplinary problems are down and , in that sense , we are surviving all right today with the all-volunteer system . On the other hand , if you look into the 1980 's when the manpower pool begins to shrink , you see some worrisome indicators on the horizon . SatEvePost : Would you favor a return to the draft ? General Haig : Well , I will not provide a quotable quote for you on that , but , as I just said , I think there are some worrisome signposts on the horizon . And I do share the judgment of President Carter when , at the outset of his administration , he said : " If we find that the all-volunteer force is not working , then we will have to reverse our current policies . " SatEvePost : Recent reports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , New York ) , among others , indicate a serious hard-drug problem among American G.I. 's in Europe . What remedial steps are being taken ? General Haig : We have not definitised to the degree that I would be satisfied about the actual scope of thehard-drug problem in Europe today . In the past four years the trends have been in a positive direction . Currently , due to increased availability , there may be a worsening trend in usage . We have launched a program designed , first , to handle the treatment , once a user is discovered , and , secondly , to improve our prophylaxis  --  that is , the prevention . I 'm not sure that the legal restraints of a commander who is faced with the problem are as responsive to the threat as is possible . In general , the big question is this : Is the Army ready to fight , or has it lost its combat effectiveness ? It is my judgment and the judgment of our commanders here that it is still a fighting Army . SatEvePost : With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't want to hear about war or talk about war . But with the focus now on Europe , many wonder about our commitment here . Is the United States carrying the biggest part of the load in NATO ? General Haig : Over the last five years America 's contribu-tions to the Alliance have de-clined about 20 percent while European contributions have steadily increased . Here are the facts : If I were to go to war today , assume command and conduct operations , I would get 90 percent of my ground forces from the Europeans ; 80 percent of my naval forces and 75 per-cent of my air forces would come from European countries , not from America . Also , there has been a misunderstanding about the integral dependence American security has on Euro-pean security and vice versa . We are , for better or worse , and have been , interdependent . Think about this Defense De-partment study for a moment : If the United States did not participate in the cost-effective , collective security effort of NATO , we would have to spend twice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provide comparable security for the United States . So this is a vital en-terprise for America 's national security . * * A couple of nagging questions remained for the general  --  especially about the year he spent as Chief of Staff in the Nixon White House in 1973-74 ? but , knowing that he has steadfastly refused to discuss this duty on countless occasions before , those questions did not come out . Pity the historians , for veteran Washington political observers say that Haig literally ran the country during that period . Indeed , publishers have reportedly offered General Haig more than half a million dollars to recount his version of the last days of the Nixon Administration . The answer is always No . " If I had been interested in money , " he told a friend at the time , " I would have never joined the Army . " Nor will he discuss his future plans . " I 'm very happy in my job here , " says the Supreme Commander . " Period . " General Haig has been pretty much his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Philadelphia lawyer , died . " I had to scramble around in a variety of jobs to help make ends meet . " He was a pretty good scrambler , for he saved enough money to attend Notre Dame for two years and then won an appointment to West Point where he graduated in the class of 1947 . Since that time his career has had a meteoric rise . Henry Kissinger , his former boss at the White House , says , " Al Haig is sure to become Chief of Staff of the Army or maybe Chairman of the Joint Chiefs . He has all of the attributes : intelligence , diligence , discipline , and experience . " And a former colleague in the Pentagon was equally impressed with this sophisticated Army officer . " Al knows politics , international affairs , and how to get along with people , " he remembers admiringly . " He has a first-rate mind , and he is not afraid to speak it . He is a man of great integrity . " General Haig is still very much his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with President Carter over the neutron bomb . Rumor had it that General Haig was prepared to walk off the job if the President did n't approve the manufacture of the bomb for his arsenal . " It did n't happen like that at all , " says a high-level source at NATO . " That 's not General Haig 's style . He would n't think of storming off the job in a 1978 huff , leaving things in turmoil and confusion . " Here 's what happened : Sure he was angry over the bomb decision , and he let the Administration know how he felt . He also let them know that they should be looking around for his replacement  --  nothing sudden , no hurry . That is Haig 's style . Fortunately , wise heads prevailed in Washington and , as we all know , they wanted him to stay on . And he did . " After four years in the top military job overseas , more than a few key diplomats believe the Supreme Commander has been a " knight on a white horse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off the suit , " as General Haig puts it , more than a few very important people are saying he could be a " knight on a white horse " in America  --  more than equal to any job he took on , including perhaps the Presidency . 1 "
