All things considered , it was not a bad week for Zare 's beleaguered President , Mobutu Sese Seko . After all , he had been struggling for a month to combat , both politically and militarily , the invasion of his country 's Shaba region by exiles who had fled the former secessionist province of Katanga in the mid-1960s . Finally , last week , Mobutu got some important signs of support from his friends . <P> Zare spokesmen announced that King Hassan II of Morocco had agreed to rush about 1,500 troops to support government forces in the mineral-rich southeastern district . The Moroccans-with Washington 's apparent blessing - were expected to join the effort to defend Kolwezi ( pop . 150,000 ) , the center of the copper-mining industry that provides Zare with more than 60% of its foreign exchange .

Uganda and the Sudan have promised supplies , France promised air support and China began airlifting 30 tons of aid to Zare . <P> Enhanced Stature . Meanwhile , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a standstill . In keeping with his charge that the Katangese invaders are armed with sophisticated Soviet weapons and are supported by Cuban advisers from neighboring Angola , Mobutu suspended diplomatic relations with Havana . <P> Now , with Moroccan and other foreign troops arriving in Zare to support <P> Mobutu , some observers speculate that the Katangese invaders may be tempted to make a fast push for Kolwezi . <P> On the other hand , as one Western diplomat in Kinshasa put it late last week , the new support from Morocco and the others " is a plus because it shows that Mobutu is not isolated . The Africans respect force . If Mobutu can put forces in the field , even foreign ones , it will inevitably enhance his stature . " <P> Faced with the Katangese invasion-which may be part of larger Soviet designs in Africa-and with rising dissatisfaction among his own people because of high prices and corruption , Mobutu has vented his frustrations on foreign newsmen , who were branded " an irresponsible gang of adventurers " by the government-controlled press . Zare even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a major rally , called by Mobutu to demonstrate popular support for his regime , had been marked by " an almost complete lack of enthusiasm . " No matter . At week 's end the government turned out 70,000 people for a better organized rally in a Kinshasa stadium .
