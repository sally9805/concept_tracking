txt Encouraged by victorious Gerald Ford and inspired by loser Ronald Reagan , a thinly united Republican Party closed its national convention Thursday and began an uphill struggle to overtake Jimmy Carter and the Democrats . After , accepting the nomination with a stirring defense of his two-year administration , the President was joined on the platform by his beaten foe , who brought tears to the eyes of his supporters with an unprecedented convention postscript . Despite the dramatic display of unity , some of the bitterness from the divisive fight remained to threaten GOP chances in the fall election , and in the face of these disquietening reminders , the President and his running mate , Sen. Robert Dole of Kansas , issued an upbeat challenge to Democrats while Reagan made an impassioned call for unity . " THIS NATION IS sound , " Ford said . " This nation is secure . This nation is on the march to full economic recovery and a better quality of life for all Americans . " With disappointment of losing apparent on his face , Reagan tied victory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the convention to adopt . " There is no substitute for victory , " he told the convention . Then , urging the delegates to follow Ford 's " call to arms " , he said the party is offering Americans a flag " of bold unmistakeable colors with no pale shades . " JUST liOW fragile the party unity may be was seen early in the session when Vice President Rockefeller rose to place Dole 's name in nomination . A few boos were heard , some delegations stayed in their seats , and many flashed " thumbs down " signs . The convention 's final session had a decidedly downbeat flavor until Ford entered the hall after the session began , sparking enthusiasm among delegates and guests who had been lethargic during Dole 's nomination and speech . As the band played , " Flail to the Chief , " and then , " Stars and Stripes Forever , " the crowd clapped , Ford waved , and even Reagan smiled . THE PRESIDENT then proceeded to deliver one of the most forceful speeches of his political career . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ campaigner as he aggressively assailed the Democratic Congress , praised his own record in office , and pledged " to do the very best I can for America . " The President took a few swipes at Democrats , claiming that he " stood for all the people against the vote-hungry , free-spending congressional majority . " He also said he would debate Carter " face to face " during the campaign. ? Carter confirmed the proposed debates a short time later in Plains , Ga . Dole , in a speech prepared in the hours after his surprise selection by Ford Tuesday morning , took note of the party division by urging Republicans to " take pride in the knowledge that the battle was honorably waged  --  honorably won . " He recalled that the last tough intraparty fight in 1952 " gave us Dwight David Eisenhower . and he gave us II years of peace and prosperity . " DOLE PROVED an acceptable but not wildely popular alternative to Reagan , whom conservatives wanted as Vice President . As a last-minute show of symbolic defiance , the conservatives nominated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the Kansas senator . But Helms withdrew quickly amid assurances from Reagan 's campaign manager , Sen. Paul Laxalt R. , Nev. , that " the Ford-Dole ticket has the enthusiastic support of Gov . Reagan . " Earlier in the day . Reagan had declared his support of Ford 's choice of Dole . And Reagan was on hand at the convention to cheer the new ticket . Like the President , Dole defended the two years of the Ford administration . And Dole praised the man who chose him , and criticized the Democrats for relying on " the discredited gimmics of government " instead of relying on the business system to solve the woes of the economy . DOLE 'S PRO-FREE enterprise and antigovernment remarks could have been a preview of one of the basic themes the Republicans will pursue during the fall campaign . The President spent most of his speech lauding his own record in office . " I come before you with a two-year record of performance , without your . mandate , " Ford said , " I offer you a four-year pledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then outlined his accomplishments in foreign and domestic policy and praised his own candor and openness . HE PLEDGED TO continue his policy of economic conservatism and a strong defense . But perhaps in an effort to soften the harsh conservatism of the party 's new platform , he also listed several socjal goals for the new admit : - tration . As if to counter the litany of - we cans , " with which Carter outlined his goals in his acceptance speech last month , Ford offered his own list of we wills " He insisted : " We will not abandon our cities ... we will make sure that the party of Lincoln remains the party of equal rights . . . we will create a tax structure that 's fair ... we will ensure that all of our young people have a better chance in life . " There were reports early Thursday that staunch Reagan backers might try a craft but the selection of Dole brought down those trial balloons . Dole is conservative enough to be acceptable to the Reagan wing of the party and also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eastern factions . KNOWN AS A TOUGH campaigner who came from far behind in the polls to grab a narrow victory in his 1974 Senate re-election , Dole has a glib and sharp wit that would make him a perfect foil to slash at the Democratic ticket during the campaign . Ford said in announcing his selection of Dole : " I 'm thrilled at the opportunity of having Bob Dole as my running mate . I 've known him Lumber of years . He served with distinction in the Senate and had an outstanding record in military service . . . . His philosophy is almost identical to mine . " And the President touched on the keys to Dole 's choice : " He is a team player .. he is a good campaigner . " BESIDES CONSULTING with Reagan , the President said he had consulted other party leaders and " all of them indicated their support ... their endorsement of Bob Dole . " Dole , dark-haired and youthful looking , immediately showed his wit , saying : " I did n't expect a call from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were M. " I 've known President Ford at a time when I could call him , Jerry , " said Dole , referring to their congressional days . " I 'm not certain what I can add to the ticket , but I will work hard to do what I can , not just for the GOP , but because I think the American people need President Ford for four more years . " Dole was accompanied by his wife . They were married last December . Dole 's previous marriage ended in divorce . IN SETTLING ON Dole , a fellow Midwesterner , Ford passed up choices that would have added more regional balance to the ticket but few of the other options would have brought the hope of a solidified GOP . One would have been Sen. Howard Baker of Tennessee , who all week appeared to be the favorite . Baker is at least on a par with Dole as far as party acceptance is concerned , and after his convention keynote speech Monday , he was applauded by moderates and liberals . Baker has been in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ won election to the Senate in 1966 , but this time he seemed to have the nomination within his grasp . IIE SAID IIE had " stirrings " early Thursday that the President was not going to pick him and described his feelings : " The tension is substantial . Another is disappointment . . . which you 'd expect . " Bob Dole is going to be a good hard campaigner . I would imagine the Democrats would have their hands full . " John Connally , the former Texas governor who had been given a dark horse rating because of his links to the Nixon-Watergate era , said : " I do n't know anybody he could 've picked that would have pleased more people in the Republican Party . " He 's smart , witty , has a great sense of humor . I think he 'll be a fierce campaigner . " DOLE WAS obliquely involved in the Watergate scandal too . As former President Nixon 's choice for Republican national chairman in 1971 and 1972 , Dole became an ardent and constant defender of Nixon . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he fought an uphill battle and won by 13,000 votes out of 000,000 cast . He obviously scored points with the President in his convention speech Monday . Dole , the temporary chairman , labeled Democratic presidential candidate Jimmy Carter a " political quick-change artist . " The Reagan cause ended shortly after midnight Thursday when the West Virginia delegation put Ford past the 1,130 votes needed for the nomination . The final tally was 1,187 to 1,070 , a remarkably close loss for Reagan considering his long challenge was against an incumbent President . BUT THE OUTCOME had been telegraphed Tuesday night when Ford won a crucial floor fight that showed he had th  --  delegates in his corner . The Wednesday night nomination speeches gave Reagan devotees their last chance to cheer , applaud , and blare through plastic horns , demonstrating several times once for nearly an hour  --  their support for their candidate . " California , Here I Come , " got more play than " Hail to Michigan , " but the Ford people , confident in their victory , were gracious and let the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breath . WIZEN IT WAS over , the President went to Reagan 's hotel for a 1:30 a.m. meeting and they met with newsmen at 2 am . Ford had pledged he would make the visit to talk about the vice presidency but declined tosay whether he had offered it .
