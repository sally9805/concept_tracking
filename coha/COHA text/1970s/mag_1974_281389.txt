The U.S. press-often accused of nitpicking and verbal overkill-confronted a remarkable opportunity , a story in which verbal overkill was virtually impossible . The transcripts of the presidential conversations of Watergate , released by the White House around 2:30 p.m. last Tuesday , were almost half as long as War and Peace . The more of this mass of material that could be got to the public , the fairer and more useful the press coverage would be , and the better prepared the nation would be to judge Richard M. Nixon . <P> Murine and Candy Bars . Newsmen found the hardest job was just reading the document . That task , reports Peter Lisagor , Washington bureau chief for the Chicago Daily News , " was a full day 's operation-with lots of Murine and candy bars for energy . " The New York Times assigned nine Washington reporters and four editors to the transcripts . The Wednesday morning edition carried nine bylined stories and ten pages of transcripts , the first of a four-part serialization of the whole thing . The Washington Post put 18 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working on Watergate for months . Distributing the text in small chunks , they read all night and produced perceptive stories on a range of subjects , including John Dean 's advice and Nixon 's personality ( " lonely , cynical " ) as revealed in the transcripts . <P> Besides scores of news and analytical stories , Associated Press and United Press International transmitted all of the estimated 350,000 words . Both carried it ( at 1,050 words a minute ) on highspeed wires normally used for stock quotations . For clients without high-speed facilities , U.P.I , also cleared one of its regular-speed wires ; clacking away 3,500 words an hour , the transmission lasted from Wednesday morning until Saturday afternoon . Says U.P.I. Night Editor Jeff Grigsby : " We 've heard that at least 25 newspapers intend to carry the transcript in its entirety . " <P> By week 's end that estimate seemed conservative . In addition to full serializations in the New York Times , Washington Post and St. Louis Post-Dispatch , one-shot Sunday supplements were scheduled in many papers , including the Los Angeles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Atlanta Constitution and Journal . The Portland Oregonian readied a 44-page supplement for sale this week ( at $1 a copy ) . Contrary to expectation , papers that have supported the President seemed as eager to practice full disclosure as those that have attacked him . The Wall Street Journal showed the split that often rends its front-page staff from its editorial-page staff . For three days the Journal ran Page One " leaders " that contained crisp summaries of the transcripts and interpretations critical of Nixon . But its editorial page was more cautious . One editorial concluded : " The President will not be impeached. "
