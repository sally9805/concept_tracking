txt Letters : Calling Home From Hotels FRITZ A. KUTTNERMRS . WALTER M. KARDYMERIL PENN YUHUGH HENEYETHAN TAUBJAMES F ... pg . 259 Letters : Calling ? Home From Hotels To the Editor : Having recently returned f=m 45 days of travel in Western Europe , I would like to bring to the attention of your readers a ripoff which appears to be frequent among hotel managements over there . If you can help It , do n't place transAtlantic telephone calls through your hotel switchboards ; the hotels are likely to double or even triple the official long-distance rates on your bill . As a typical example : for a nineminute call from Berlin to New York , which would have cost $27 in New York , I was charged $70 on my bill , and my protestations were of no avail . It is possible to save oneself this wild overcharge by placing overseas calls at the post office ; but unfortunately , most post offices are closed at the time of the night when transAtlantic calls are best placed to reach one 's party in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United States now in less than 30 seconds by direct dialing in one 's hotel room , the expense to the hotel of handling such calls is negligible , which makes such surcharges outrageous and indefensible . New York FRITZ A , KUTTNER Ed Carr , of the Long Lines Department of the American Telephone &; Telegraph Company , replies : A. T. &; T. is well aware of the problem , which has long been annoying Americans traveling abroad , and it has been working on this with foreign hotel associations and travel boards . Customers in some European countries have found hotel surcharges on telephone calls ranging up to 300 percent . In April , A.T . &T.; reached an agreement , called Teleplan , which substantially reduced and set limits on hotel surcharges for calls from Ireland and Israel to the United States , and it hopes to conclude similar agreements this summer with the Netherlands . the Scandinavian countries and Portugal . THE UNCROWDED WEST To the Editor : We happened to be on an airplane heading west on our first trip to Durango . Colo. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The West Without Crowds " ( Travel Section , July 25 ) and the next day we took one of the auto trips she suggested . We left Durango at about 10 in the morning , heading north through Silverton and Ouray . We stopped in Telluride for lunch , turned south to Cortez , then headed east back to . Durango  --  a perfect trip and a perfect introduction to Colorado 's magnificent mountain scenery . Even though we circulated the " dogeared " clipping of that article all week among our friends at the conference we were attending  --  and even though they too headed north for Telluride ? those Colorado roads remained uncrowded . We ca n't wait to go west again and try those other itineraries suggested in the article . MRS . WALTER M. KARDY Kensington , Ma . To the Editor : Grace Lichtenstein 's article is an . affront to anyone who can tell the , difference between the Rockies and Coney Island . Picking a bouquet of wildflowers is misguided at best . First , wuanowers frequently will not grow the following season @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law  --  picking them is illegal and subject to fines . Third , wildflowers are beautiful where they grow , but they make awful bouquets  --  they wilt . Visit our mountains , enjoy the flowers and leave them for others to enjoy . MERIL PENN Yu . Denver EXERCISES ALOFT To the Editor : The notes item ( Travel Section , Aug. 1 ) describing Lufthansa 's plans for exercises while traveling in an airplane for long periods of time brings to mind the fact that late Dr. Paul Dudley White , the noted heart specialist , tried unsuccessfully to get the transcontinental and transoceanic airlines to install leg-exercising devices at each passenger seat on their planes . It was Dr. White 's writings that introduced me to the idea of doing leg exercises aloft , and I can attest to the fact that on an eight-hour flight , the bending of the knees is a fairly , good substitute for walking and helps overcome travel fatigue . HUGH HENEY Randolph , Mass . FLORENCE To the Editor : As one who has visited Florence , I enjoyed Herbert R. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Piazza " ( Travel Section , July 25 ) . However , in // passing , Mr. Lottman mentions the Agenzia Enologica Italiana , and comments that it " bears a name . .. that many tourists will not be able to identify . " Unfortunately , he seems to be one of them . " Oenological " is not , as he states , " a Latinrooted word for that which has to do with wine . " Rather , it is a Greek one , the proper Latin word for wine being " vintun . " ETHAN TAUB New Haven , Conn . LAKE CHAMPLAIN To the Editor : Many of the smaller motels in the Lake Champlain area of Vermont are somewhat perplexed wondering " where all the tourists have gone . " The feeling among traveltransportation industry people here this summer is that rumors of overcrowded facilities resulting from the Olympics in nearby Montreal and the Bicentennial have caused many would-be visitors to change their plans . Actually , vacationers need not be concerned about finding a comfortable place to stay in the Lake Champlain area between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Furthermore , officials in Rutland , St. Albans and Grand Isle also report a surplus of accommodations . JAMES F. DALEY Lake Champlain Regional Chamber of Commerce Burlington , Vt . WESTPORT FETE To the Editor : The Westport Young Woman 's League will sponsor the first annual Westport Creative Arts Festival at Bedford Junior High School , Riverside Avenue , on Saturday , Nov. 13 ; from 10 A.M. to 5 P.M. and on Sunday from 11 A.M. to 5 P.M. There will be over 65 craftsmen involved in this show from many New England states , and the monies raised will go to various local charities and organizations . KOGARET A. PROD Westport , litmn . AIRPORT SECURITY To the Editor : A further comment on airport security as touched upon in your Letters Column ( Travel Section , Aug. 8 ) : While visiting Spain and Portugal last month , I flew Avianca , Iberia and TAP , and in no instance was there any precaution taken against hijacking . There was'no security check whatsoever of passengers or of luggage , and airport attendants expressed amazement that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Travel Agency Management New York THE LOIRE VALLEY To the Editor . In regard to the ? article , " What 's Doing in the Loire Valley " ( Travel Section , Aug. 1 ) unless things have changed drastically in the last six years , beware of the guided tours of the chateaus . The tourists become captive audiences of the guides , and we found no way to escape from the long-winded explanations of the most minute appurtenances . The guides would not allow us to wander around by ourselves , and we found the tours extremely long and very dull . I think tourists might have better luck going it on their own . MRS . ROBERT P. HERZOG Stamford , Conn . To the Editor : It is inconceivable to me how Mr. Lottman could possibly suggest to the reader to pass by Chinon and just traverse the city itself . Having just returned from a " mind-and-soul broadening " trip to this area , I was overwhelmed by the grandeur and the historic value of Chinon . Commanding the sweeping views of the Vienne and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come since time immemorial , the towers and rooms still preserved at Chinon today are worth a trip in themselves . Inside one of the remaining rooms one can see a complete replica of the chateau as it stood in its days of glory , a mighty fortress and miracle of architecture . In one of the remaining towers the Templars.were imprisoned during the 13th century . The secret writings , scratched into the soft limestone , tell of their sufferings and torture . It was at Chinon that Jeanne d'Arc sought out the Dauphin Charles , hiding among his courtiers , challenging him to take his rightful place as King of France and throw out the invading British armies . Today , the French historical societies are trying to raise sufficient funds to restore Chinon to its former state , by rebuilding it stone by stone . To my mind , all other castles are mere showplaces , eye - pleasing toys compared to Chinon , which , even in ruins , finds no equal in the historic Chateau Valley . RUTH B. MELCHET Queens NORWAY AND IRELAND To the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American relatives dropping in for a visit , I say shake hands with your counterparts , a Norwegian-American couple in the United States . It 's a known fact that when Norwegians come here to visit relatives , they expect and get the royal treatment , but strangely enough , it does n't seem to work in reverse . When we visited our relatives in Norway , the four of us spent days and days touring the countryside . True , they used their car , but we paid for gasoline , meals ( at least four every day ) , lodgings , souvenirs and all sightseeing attractions en route . Not once did a Norwegian make a motion toward his pocket . Later , our Norwegian host and his wife visited the United States on a two-week business assignment with a generous expense account . Now we picked up where we left off in Norway  --  auto trips , dining out , sightseeing  --  and a good bit of it all was paid by you-know-who . Furthermore , if we had not been alert , our home would have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it would seem that we are rather gullible to be so taken in . But not at all . Similar experiences have been related to us by many of our NorwegianAmerican friends , so ours was not an isolated incident . It will , however , be our last ; we have learned our lesson . May we , too , omit our names . We are just interested in letting Irish Husband know that he is not alone . NORWEGIAN-AMERICAN Brooklyn SHUTTLES To the Editor : I have frequent occasion to take Eastern Airlines ' shuttle back and forth between La Guardia and Washington , and in the past two or three months it has seemed to me that there has been a tremendous increase in the proportion of Lockheed Electras ( as distinguished from ** on these flights . Do you happen to know if there has been some subtle shift of policy in this respect ? WILLIAM A. RUSHER New York William R. Tow , regional manager of public relations for Eastern in New York , replies : The ** on the elf : shuttle undergo maintenance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ August . Each aircraft is out for six to seven days during this period of total overhaul ; and when this happens , the prime DC-9 is replaced by ad Electra . Eastern is planning to phase out the Electras from May through November ; 1977 . TRAVEL BY RAIL To the Editor : Jack Goodman 's article , " Crossing America on the U.S.A. Rail Pass " ( Travel. ? Section , July 18 ) , alludes to a few . " horror stories , " btkt , in my traveling across Ameti ? ca by rail and talking with : other passengers and stag , I 'm forced to conclude that bad service is the norm .

In my trek through Atlanta , Houston , Los Angeles , San : Francisco , Seattle and Chicago to New York the menu rarely changed , waiting time for most meals was over an hour , and the system for taking orders created such chaos that ' several ' dishes were brought out before the right one arrived .
