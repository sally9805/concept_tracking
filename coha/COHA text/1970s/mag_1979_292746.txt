Should state or parents decide ? <P> On a Pacific beach near Tijuana , Mexico , Chad Green , a frail but lively three-year-old American boy , was happily digging into the sand last week and laughing at squirrels scampering near by , quite unaware that he is the subject of a dramatic medical and legal controversy . Chad is suffering from leukemia , and an argument is raging over who has the right to decide how he should be treated : his parents , Gerald and Diana Green , or state officials in Massachusetts responding to the advice of doctors . <P> A blond child with a winning smile , Chad began chemotherapy at the University of Nebraska Medical Center in his home town of Omaha when he was 21 months old . Doctors there claimed that he was improving rapidly under their care and that the leukemia was in remission . But when they suggested radiation treatment for further protection , Green , who is a welder , and his wife moved to Massachusetts and placed Chad with Dr. John Truman , a noted specialist in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chemotherapy . <P> The Greens , however , had found that the chemotherapy was a painful ordeal for Chad . The injections turned him at times into " a wild animal , " his mother declared . Truman then gave her the chemicals in the form of pills , to be taken at home . When leukemia was again found in Chad 's blood early in 1978 , Mrs. Green reluctantly admitted that she had not been giving Chad his pills . " Chemotherapy does n't cure , " said Diana Green in desperation . Instead , the parents had been giving the boy Laetrile , a drug which is illegal for use in cancer treatment in Massachusetts , and which repeated medical studies have found useless for that purpose . <P> When the Greens refused to resume chemotherapy , despite warnings from Truman that Chad would die without it , a legal battle began . Chad was declared a ward of the state for medical purposes only . The parents retained custody , but chemotherapy was administered at state expense . Chad 's health improved . When the Greens asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well , it was denied . Last month the Greens fled to Tijuana with Chad , placing him in a clinic headed by Dr. Ernesto Contreras , who advocates Laetrile for its psychological benefits , rather than as a cure for cancer . <P> Chad last week was taking Laetrile , together with vitamins and health foods , as well as his chemotherapy pills . Massachusetts doctors warned , however , that Laetrile was incompatible with regular chemotherapy and had , in fact , caused signs of cyanide poisoning in Chad 's body . After considering a possible kidnaping charge against the Greens , Massachusetts Attorney General Francis X. Bellotti instead sought a court order demanding that the Greens return Chad to Massachusetts for treatment . Judge Guy Volterra granted the order . Last week he held the parents in contempt of court for disobeying it , but gave them another week to comply before assessing any penalty .
