I KNOW THERE 'S A COD . An old man who sits in heaven and judges . I do n't mean the God who throws lightning bolts into crap games or flies around balling wood nymphs who give birth to four-headed frogs . No , the God I believe in does n't give in to fits of rage , or indulge in whimsy . Maybe in the old days but not now . Centuries of massacres and not being able to find a parking place have worn down His passion for life . He is becoming a God of little faith , and when I tell Him my tale of woe , as I have done each night for the past two years , He shrugs His shoulders , nods , and says , " So ? " Not the " So ?

My tale of unrequited martyrdom begins in Chicago , that wonderful town . After the Great Trial , I was besieged with all sorts of not-to-bebelieved offers . There were half a dozen movie deals , including one for $50,000 and a percentage of the prof. its for allowing some filmmakers to follow me around for two weeks . There were offers of up to $10,000 for Dear Abbie letters received during the trial , of $15,000 for my trial testimony , which was public record anyway . A doll designer asked for permission to market a set of dolls , one a policeman and the other a caricature of me ( the Abbie doll always gets busted ) .

Now , no writer actually sits dov to write a book that no one wou publish , but I felt a compulsion to r ject the sensible course and plum my hand into the cookie-jar world publishing censorship .

And it was that difference I wanted to test . Books as theatrical props have always interested me . In Woodstock Nation , for example , there were three little tricks on the back cover that are relevant to this tale . First , there is a long quotation from the book which does n't appear in the book at all . Second , if you look carefully at the silhouetted photograph of the author you can discern a dirty word on the forehead , something the Random House censors would clearly never have allowed had they detected it . Third , in the upper left corner appeared the legend " Steal This Book .

I had him label the pages . Across each and every section he penned , " Taken word for word from 1LS handbook , " " The complete mini-manual by Marighela . " In the end about twenty pages were vaguely original . Lawyers were summoned , and the text was examined . It was agreed Haber would get 22 percent of any future royalties as a researcher and that I would continue the research and write the book . Contract signed . Exit Mr. Haber .

It was one of a kind . Christopher Cerf was my editor at Random House . He championed the book to the top- of the house . House said nyet . Chris quit . Damn it . The book then went to thirty other publishers . Change this , change that , they said . Mostly change the title . One offered $40,000 up front if all the proper changes were made .

The libertarians won . The book stayed . Battles were fought in Indiana , Connecticut , and Iowa . In Lansing , Michigan , the police caught two men running from a vacant building whose door had just blown off . A copy of STB was found on them . For a while , the police were trying to indict me on a conspiracy rap .

Register ( sic ) , executive director of the National Association of Retail Grocers , and The National Review all accused me of contributing to the rise in food prices because I gave shoplifting advice . How 's that for consensus ! The Department of the Interior called a press conference and denounced the book , saying they no longer give away any free buffalo . They had received over 3,000 requests . The R. T. French Company announced they no longer lent out a film on parakeets , saying they had had to hire a full-time secretary to answer letters .

None in the San Francisco Bay area either . The entire Doubleday chain of bookstores was boycotting the book . Vice-president George Hecht stated , " We do n't want to tell people to steal . We object only to the title . If it was called How To Live for Free , we 'd sell it . " Grove reported that nearly 40 percent of their outlets refused to carry the book . HEN WE GOT A BREAK .

I clipped the review , wrote a check , and sent the Times its own review as an ad . Reject . The Rader review shamed a few wholesalers , and some stores buckled under customer pressure . People actually started boycotting places for not carrying the book . As head of the promotion department , I criss-crossed the country appearing on talk shows and giving interviews . On radio shows I began by giving the credit card number for the station . That usually ended the show . A Judge Liebowitz tried to pressure a New York television show into canceling me . He failed . In Baltimore I did a great show with two professional shoplifters ( shot from the back , match ) . The station refused to air it . People are always saying they 've seen me on TV . It 's strange , because I 've almost always been censored or boycotted . After the Rader review there was a backlash of bad rapping . Some folks charged I was giving out trade secrets . Forcade wrote that I was making $500,000 profit . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was categorically refused any sort of credit . The local supermarket assigned a special salesclerk to check me out . Airline officials took me into little booths for examination . The Village Voice , in a sophisticated display of hairsplitting , charged that I was writing to titillate the New York magazine crowd . I had foolishly stated in the book that I knew two foolproof ways to fly for free but could n't mention them . I got about two hun dred letters that began , " You cal trust me never to tell anyone . " In ai I got about fifteen thousand Dea Abbie letters , most of which said i was their favorite book or asked hot they could get a copy . At about this time .

I wrote a defense to How could they do this without as ing for a comment ? " You 're famot therefore fair game , " was their a swer . Having been slaughtered in media massacre , I retreated to lick wounds . Naturally , all the talk of la suits was ridiculous . Haber and I n ( er spent a moment in court . He we back to Europe . Reenter Forcade . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . More press . Everyo thinks I 'm being sued by a dozen d ferent people . All I 've learned abc the media is coming hack to hat me .

After t months , he is awarded $3,000. 1 lawyers probably got most . I had ready given him $1,000 and agr ( to pay the rest later . Exit Forca Enter Barney Rosset . Barney Rosset is the head of Gr Press . According to its sales figtn Grove has sold 350,000 copies . According to Grove payment figures , I have received $41,000 , roughly $35,000 of which went into the publishing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousand bucks profit , all of which I owe to my lawyer , Forcade , and Haber . Under a standard writer-publisher contract , I would receive $70,000 on that many sales but , remember , I published the book . Ac7.ording to my reading of our contract , Grove sells the book for 97.5 tents , pays roughly 20 cents for printng , 2 cents for shipping , keeps 39 vents or more profit , and returns the ' est to me , minus , say , another 2.5 : ents for miscellaneous expenses .

I go to court with few lawyers . 4 THE TIME I was forced to stop printing the book , it was selling respectable 6,000 copies a month . , ancer Books knew this and asked ie if I would be interested in writing n updated version of the book for tem .

I agreed . Instead of mply updating , I again plunged Ito six months of extensive research ad writing , which ate up much of ie advance . I met counterfeiters , ink robbers , all the great phone Creeks in the country , professional toplifters , jewel smugglers , and lock ickers . In the two and a half years nce STB had appeared , a steady ream of outlaws had been using me a sort of Father Confessor . They erred more than willing to discuss Lch and every detail of their scam. any gave me their code names and anted to he mentioned in any future a ) k . I paid each one for any ideas at I used .

During the research on the ok . I ended up in a room it would have been best not to enter . As a result I was framed on a narcotics sale charge and now face a mandatory life sentence in a New York penal colony . Shipped off to the Tombs for a month , I persisted in finishing the book only to discover on reentry that Lancer Books had dropped the deal . So , once again a strange manuscript goes out to New York publishers . Once again I hear praise for the book and projected sales of a million copies . However , the next sentence is always , " It 's not our type of book , " or , " There will be hundreds of lawsuits , " there is nothing illegal about publishing the book l or , " Why do n't you settle down , Abbie , and write a nice book about sex or something ?

I 'm convinced I 've journeyed through this purgatory of publishing trials and tribulations to learn some greater truth about life . Forcade , Haber , Rosset , Frank Register , New York narcos , bankrupt book companies , courts , arbitrations , throwing away a million bucks just to write books telling people how to steal , censorship conspiracies ? all this happened for some reason . Methinks I flew too close to the sun . The M &; Ms in my mind have turned to a sea of chocolate mush . God sits in the easy chair in the corner of the room . His pudgy hands are folded across His girth and He is dozing . At the reading table by His side lies a copy of Franz Kafka 's short stories . The book is opened to the tale of " A Hunger Artist . " It 's one of my favorite stories . A hunger artist travels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from miles around just to watch this guy go without eating . He sets all sorts of records until finally there is no one to beat but himself . So he just keeps going and going until one day there is nothing left but some bones lying unnoticed in the straw at the bottom of a cage . Thus is the circus of life . God stirs and knocks the book to the floor . Gee , He looks a lot like Jason Epstein . And me ? Well , I 'm looking pretty skinny these days .
