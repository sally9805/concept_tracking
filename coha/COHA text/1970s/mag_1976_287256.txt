Hatched in open sores on cattle , their screw-shaped larvae can literally eat their way through a live steer . For years , they were a major scourge of the cattle country in the U.S. Southwest . It was not until the 1960s that screwworm flies were brought under control by a cunning form of biological warfare . Millions of flies , bred in a factory in Mission , Texas , were irradiated with sterilizing doses of gamma rays and released into the wild . When sterile males mated with normal females , which make only one sexual contact during their two or three weeks of life , the unions produced only infertile eggs-and the fly population and cattle losses dropped sharply . Now the number of infested cattle has begun to rise again , and three Texas scientists think they know one major reason why : the irradiated male flies are outperformed sexually by their normal counterparts . <P> Afternoon Heat . While probing differences between wild-and factory-bred flies , Zoologist Guy L. Bush and Biochemist G. Barrie Kitto of the University of Texas , with Zoologist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , found that the larvae were kept at an unnaturally constant , warm temperature , mainly to speed up growth . Also , young flies were unable to fly around much in their cages . Eventually , the researchers write in Science , a markedly different strain emerged . No longer as vigorous , the male does not become active until the heat of afternoon , whereas his wild brethren are busy impregnating females from early morning until late afternoon , keeping the species alive and well . <P> U.S. Department of Agriculture scientists concede that the Texas scientists could have a point , but insist that other factors are also at work in the new wave of cattle infestation : warm weather last winter and moist conditions this summer have increased the birth rate of the fly ; there are fewer ranch hands to check and treat cattle on the ranges ; and a recent proliferation of Gulf Coast ear ticks has resulted in wounds on cattle that provide ideal hatching places for screwworm larvae . In addition , some scientists speculate that because the factory males are smaller and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less attractive . In any case , future factory-bred males may be more formidable sexual competitors . The Texas factory and a large new breeding plant formally opened last month under a joint U.S.-Mexican commission in Tuxtla Gutierrez , Mexico , are now producing a more aggressive fly strain , tagged 009 . Explains a commission spokesman : " He is a macho Mexican fly , and factory breeding should not dilute his sex drive . "
