txt CHARLOTTE , N.C. I API  --  Operating in such urgency they had no time for anesthetics , Charlotte Memorial Hospital doctors cut into the chest of Randy Cook , 25 , a bartender , to save his life after an assailant had plunged a knife into his heart . One of the doctors halted the flow of blood from the heart by holding his finger in the hole made by the knife until stitches could be made . The work moved so quickly that Cook was still wearing his pants and boots when the operation was over 90 minutes later . IT WAS 2:30 a.m . Sunday . Cook was rushed directly from the ambulance to the operating room . Dr. Richard Glaser made the cut , felt around the rapidly beating heart until he found the hole in the heart wall , and then held his finger there , stopping the bleeding . Glaser , Dr. Michael Thomason , and the other members of the operating room team then began to do the things that normally would // Finger in heart saves his life // have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blood pressure , and , finally , give him an anesthetic . Glaser , 34 , just days away from finishing his thoracic surgery residency , used two big stitches to close the half-inch hole in Cook 's heart . " THE HOLE was very hard to find , " Thomason said . " Once we got in , we had 15 to 20 seconds to find the hole . " Both doctors said Cook would have died if everything had n't clicked  --  from the time he was picked up by paramedics at a downtown Charlotte restaurant , where he was stabbed while trying to stop a knife-wielding patron , to the time when surgery was completed . Cook was in satisfactory condition late Monday . He said he remembers only snatches of the hospital drama . " I remember rushing down the hall , and I remember feeling that first cut , " Cook said . Glaser said the whole incident hit him afterward : " I had to go over and sit down . That 's when it hits you  --  when it 's over . "  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
