Howard S. Levin opened his small fist and a cascade of varicolored business cards fluttered onto his luncheon table . One card identified him as president of Levin-Townsend Computer Corp . Others proclaimed separately that he headed three affiliates : Las Vegas ' Bonanza Hotel &; Casino , National Equities Inc. and Levin-Townsend Service Corp . " Take them , " he told TIME Correspondent Rudolph Rauch last week . " They are all obsolete . " <P> In a corporate coup organized with stunning secrecy , 45-year-old Levin had been bounced from the presidency of Levin-Townsend Computer , a seven-year-old leasing company that aspired to become a conglomerate . As Levin tells the story , he went to a board meeting in Manhattan after Co-Founder James E. Townsend had told him that there would be no agenda . " Suddenly , " says Levin , " there was an agenda and a motion removing me as president . " It carried 4-2 , and Levin trudged back to his office-which he says he found locked and watched by security guards . <P> A Fling on Broadway . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , teamed up with Townsend , a former Union Carbide executive , in creating a company to buy computers from IBM and lease them to users at a discount . The firm prospered , and Levin began spreading into the far-off fields of restaurant franchising , real estate and Nevada gambling , in which he had no real management experience . After Levin-Townsend bought the Bonanza Hotel last March , Levin got into what gambling authorities described as a " childish feud " with Nathan S. Jacobson , who owned an important minority share in the hotel and held its gaming and liquor licenses . Las Vegans say that the squabble intensified when Jacobson tried to fire Patty Miller , a blonde secretary whom Levin later made the hotel 's administrative assistant . ( Another secretary , Carol Parks , became Levin-Townsend treasurer , but was turned out in the cold last week with Levin . ) Levin-Townsend even played angel to two Broadway musicals , Maggie Flynn and The Fig Leaves Are Falling-both resounding flops . <P> Executives who have dealt with Levin say that he rammed through several acquisitions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " maybe I made some mistakes , " but insists that directors were fully informed and made no objections . The acquisitions generally expanded Levin-Townsend 's revenues but did nothing for profits . Sales in the first half of the company 's 1970 fiscal year , ended last September , rose to $33 million from $23 million a year earlier , but profits dropped to $3.6 million from $5.2 million . The company is expected to report a loss for the Dec. 31 quarter , and its stock has tumbled from a 1969 high of $58 to $13 last week . <P> Wall Streeters expect Levin , who owns 9% of Levin-Townsend stock , to start a proxy fight . He speaks with patronizing contempt of the executives who dismissed him . Of Onetime Friend Townsend he says : " Jim could implement that which I could conceive . " With MacArthur-like resolve , Levin vows : " I will be back . "
