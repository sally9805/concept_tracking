THE GOSPEL BOOM Snap on the TV , turn up the stereo , pick out a paperback . Thanks to modern technology , the Christian message has been amplified , and it 's coming through loud and clear . A nd Jesus came and spake unto them , saying , All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth . Go ye therefore , and teach all nations . . Matthew 28 : 1 8,19 The theme music begins , and on the television screen a PTL logo becomes a globe turning to show scenes of the different countries in which PTL is broadcast . The scenes change with the tempo of the music . The majestic ending is co-host Henry Harrison 's cue to introduce , in Ed McMahon style , PTL 's president , Jim Bakker ( pronounced Bayker ) . Thus begins another segment of the " PTL ( Praise The Lord ) Club , " America 's most viewed daily television program . The purpose of the popular show is to spread the Word of the Lord , a common goal in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unique way . The " greatest story ever told " may not have changed in 2,000 years , but the manner of telling it has been revolutionized . Utilizing such modern miracles as video tape , cable hookups , and satellite networks , PTL and other broadcast ministries are reaching millions of viewers . And that 's only the beginning . Aided by technology , the entire gospel industry  --  from records to radio spots to bestselling books  --  is booming . Gifted singers , songwriters , and musicians , committed to amplifying the Christian message , are using highly advanced equipment to mix sounds into innovative blends and record them on stereo albums and tapes . Result ? New listeners are attracted to the Christian cause . Add to this the enormous numbers of inspirational books being written , published , and distributed throughout the world , and the verdict is simple : Advanced methods of cornmunications are exposing more people to religion today than ever before . How successful are the efforts of these space-age missionaries ? Judge for yourself . Born-Again Airwaves Originating from the impressive Bruton Parish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the two-hour-long PTL Christian variety program mixes modern gospel music with old-time religion . Hollywood per sonalities such as Pat Boone , Dale Evans , and Dean Jones join the not-so-famous guests with testimonies of healings and miracles in a friendly talk show format which is viewed live via PTL 's own satellite network , not only in its home town of Charlotte , North Carolina , but also in Los Angeles and Canton , Ohio . In fact , the PTL Satellite Network transmits 24 hours a day to hundreds of cities in America through its cable affiliates , and the " PTL Club " video tape is quickly reproduced and mailed to 215 television stations throughout America and 25 foreign countries . PTL 's beginnings were less than auspicious . In 1973 , Jim Moss , PT L 's executive vice president , joined other Charlotte Christians in founding the " Praise The Lord " program . Broadcasting from minuscule studios , the fledgling program had difficulty in getting talent and raising the money necessary to keep the program on the air . " That old studio was so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " quipped one of the original guests . Later that year , Jim Bakker left the television ministry he founded in Los Angeles and joined the group as host . With an income the first year of $240,000 , the team , made up of young and aggressive men and women , began to grow . What has prompted PTL 's unusual expansion ? " While other ministries concentrated on larger cities , we went into the Paducah , Kentuckys , and Dothan , Alabamas , thereby building a strong base of support , " says Moss , the man responsible for building the network . " Jim Bakker is down to earth ; the common people relate to him . He 's not afraid to be spontaneous and show his emotions . " In 1977 a Spanish version of the program was formed called " Club PTL . " Now it is viewed in 18 countries in Latin America and has top ratings in four . With offices in Panama , this lively gospel program featuring well-known artists is having a significant effect in both the Roman Catholic and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taped at the Charlotte station several times a year after the English " PTL Club " is aired . The Rev. Benson Idahosa is the host of the African " PTL Club , " which is now viewed in Nigeria , Ghana , and Liberia . Plans are under way to develop an Italian , French , and Japanese " PTL Club . " " I do n't believe in tokenism . The gospel must be communicated to people in their own language , consistent with their own culture , " says Bakker , who had never left the United States until his around-the-world tour in October of 1978 . Bakker views television as the most effective modern tool to communicate the gospel , and plans are in the offing to diversify programing . Although the " PTL Club " will continue to receive the network 's main emphasis , other types of programs are on the drawing boards . An evangelical children 's program to compete with Saturday morning children 's shows is planned . Gary S. Paxton , known for his rock-and-roll hits of the ' 50 's , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A Christian soap opera with a strong emphasis on Christianity as the solution to everyday problems is also in the forecast . The CBN Story Sharing PTL 's success in the field of television ministry is the Christian Broadcasting Network ( CBN ) , Inc. , founded by Dr. M. G. " Pat " Robertson . The son of a U. S. senator from Virginia , Yale Law School graduate , and successful New York businessman , Robertson had been dramatically converted while in New York . He came to Portsmouth , Virginia , in 1960 with a family and $70 in his pocket to purchase a TV station . After 12 years CBN had grown from a dilapidated , UHF station into an expanding religious network whose popular talk-variety show , " The 700 Club , " could be seen by hundreds of thousands of viewers across the United States . Now , in 1979 , CBN has blossomed further into a major worldwide broadcasting network , reaching into all 50 states and 22 foreign countries with a variety of innovative Christian programing , and Robertson is now president of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ university , and a newly formed commercial network . More than 200 TV stations now carry CBN shows . In the midst of such swirling , rapid change , the message of CBN is still the same as it was in 1960 when Robertson deposited a token $3 into CBN 's newly opened bank account and promptly began to proclaim the gospel . Camera equipment broke down twice , film was caught in the projector , and the entire broadcast lasted only two-and-a-half hours . However amateurish the beginning , the message of salvation reached into the living rooms and dens of local residents , and CBN was born . Financial problems were legend in those early days , and it was out of monetary woes that " The 700 Club " was formed . Robertson decided to hold a fund-raising telethon and calculated that he needed approximately $7,000 a month for operating expenses . He asked that 700 viewers pledge $10 each month to meet those costs and thus dubbed the telethon " The 700 Club . " Pleased with its success , station executives made " The 700 Club @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the flagship show of the network and features such guests as President Carter , former President Ford , Chuck Colson , Eldridge Cleaver , Graham Kerr , Anita Bryant , and others . The show is slick and modern by industry standards . Relaxed in a comfortable studio chair , Dr. Robertson , along with co-host Ben Kinchlow , listens and asks probing questions while guests discuss conversions , healings , various religious issues , and personal testimonies . The format closely resembles that of other popular talk shows , such as Johnny Carson 's " Tonight Show . " " We simply took a format that had worked on the commercial networks and applied it to CBN , " Dr. Robertson says . " It was a proven format that had reached millions of Americans . " But unlike the commercial counterparts , Robertson makes no special claim to fame , nor does he expect his name to be on the tip of every Christian 's tongue . " Our job is to make people see Jesus . If they see us , we 've failed . They have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spread the word by visual means , a new , toe-tapping breed of gospel music appeals to the ears of the audience . Well-trained voices , experienced musicians , and professional sound engineers are producing high quality tapes and albums which offer not only superb sounds but music with a message . " The message is most important , " explains Dallas Holm , singer-composer with the David Wilkerson Crusade . " I make a conscious effort to make my songs easily understood . I consider myself not just a performer and writer , but a minister , too . " Holm 's approach might be described as soft rock , one of several musical styles that are gaining favor with concert and radio audiences . Other sounds run the gamut from hard rock to Southern gospel . Holm sees himself somewhere in the middle , which is exactly the position he prefers . " For so many years , gospel music was represented by the smooth-tongued , sharkskin-clad quartet types that ran around the country selling family Bibles and trips to the Holy Land . When you say ' gospel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those types of groups . We 're so far removed from that today ; I like to call our sound Christian contemporary music . " Equally contemporary in their musical ministries are vocalists Kathie Lee Johnson , from TV 's " Name That Tune , " and Sharalee Lucas , who spreads the Word not only through a uniquely rhythmic rock sound but also via a new book and concert appearances . Although both are devoted to the Christian cause , they are also sharp businesswomen who want to Continued on page 40 . succeed in a very competitive field . Success means more exposure , and exposure means touching new lives . " The ministry part of it does not stop an artist from being a good businessperson , " says Sharalee . " I want my records to do well ; if my records do well , then what I have to say in my records , in my music , and in my books will reach the people I ca n't reach personally . " Kathie Lee Johnson agrees . " If God has given you a talent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just sit there and frustrate you . I wanted to do something with my talent that would touch people musically , yes , but spiritually as well . Touching a person 's soul is the catalyst for changing him . " Kathie Lee 's current schedule has her reaching people through a variety of channels  --  commercials , " $100,000 Name That Tune , " and " Hee Haw Honeys . " A new sacred album , Finders , Keepers , includes country-flavored material to appeal to country fans . The Written Word Although the history of Christian literature can be traced back to the fifteenth century , modern technology has increased the impact of inspirational books . Now available in all languages , braille , and oversized type , Christian books are reproduced by quick offset printing methods and shipped throughout the world by way of ultramodern transportation networks . The supply is great , but so is the demand . A Gallup poll indicates one out of three Americans reads one or more books a month , and according to the poll , the Bible and a variety of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Zondervan Publishing House reports that over one million copies of the New International Version of the Bible were sold before it was even off the press  --  this , after the precedent-setting Good News for Modern Man translation outsold every paperback in the country several years ago . It 's not surprising that such noted publishers as Doubleday , Scott Foresman , and Harper &; Row have flexed in-house religious arms to feed this voracious reading appetite . In Colorado Springs , the Christian Booksellers Association enters its second quarter-century with some 2,800 member stores existing nationwide , in Canada , and in 32 foreign countries  --  double the membership of 1973 . And this does not include the 35 percent of Christian bookstores that are not CBA members . Sales at CBA-member stores exceed $600 million a year . An average of one store is opening or applying for CBA membership daily , and whereas general bookstores Continued on page 136 did n't it ? " I froze and looked to see if she were purposely twisting the knife . " No , Jane ! There are no ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ask , ' Was she happy then ? ' . . . every picture ! I wish you could tell me when the negative feelings started so I could at least feel good about the memories before that point . " My hurt and anger were apparent . " I ca n't tell you when , " she said softly . " But Jason , there are some memories I will always treasure . I hope that someday you will be able to remember some warm times we spent together . . especially like those with David and Patti , and Charles , or the Christmas tree with Matt .... " Then she looked away . The sad truth dawned for us simultaneously : We would be creating no more memories together . I could not imagine at that moment that just a few months later , sitting on the floor at David and Patti 's , I could laugh over popcorn and Cokes , about this memory and that memory  --  none of us afraid to speak Jane 's name . Today I feel free to enjoy the memory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was so natural as I decorated the Christmas tree to recall the significance of certain ornaments . It was a warm time of joy that I needed . Jane encouraged a lot of good , positive things in my life . I recalled her words spoken late one night : " I want you to become strong , and through this experience , you will . " This past Christmas Eve , I stood with many others , unable to get into Garden Grove Community Church for the annual candlelight service . As we stood in the crowd , we sang . It was my first Christmas in California , a warm , beautiful day . A strange and tentative sensation bubbled inside and spilled over in the old familiar carols , celebrating the birth of the Joy-Giver . My grandfather died on Christmas Eve ; our presents for him this year were unopened . At Granddad 's funeral , a quartet sang his favorite gospel song : " 0 they tell me of a home far beyond the skies .... 0 they tell me of a home far away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but he had a vision : the unclouded day . That raised the ultimate question : Can I trust God enough to totally commit all my weight to the belief that He wants the best for me ? And Granddad 's faith sings in my spirit . Yes ! I did not stand at a casket or graveside to say good-bye to Jane . But our farewell was just as final . I said goodbye to the person , and then , months later , to the memory . Jane now occupies a quiet place in my heart . /7 . Reprinted from Jason Loves Jane ( Bur They Got a Divorce ) by Jason Towner . Copyright e 1978 by Impact Books .
