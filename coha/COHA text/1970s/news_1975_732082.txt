txt Dmitri Shostakovich , the Soviet Union 's most celebrated composer , died yesterday evening following hospitalization for a heart ailment at the , beginning of this month . He was 68 years old . Shostakovich 's death was confirmed this morning by an official at the Kremlin-run hospital at Kuntsevo on Moscow 's western outskirts . The hospital cares for top-level Soviet party and Government figures and celebrities . The composer , who was admitted 10 days ago to the special hospital 's heart disease section , Was reported to have died of heart failure at 6:30 P.M. The official press agency , ' Tass , acknowledged this afternoon that Shostakovich had died " after a grave illness " but offered no medical details . He was known to have suffered from heart ailments that dated to his hospitalization for a heart attack in 1964 . However , Shostakovich had continued to compose up to his most recent illness and , according to Tass , had just written a new Sonata for Viola and Piano . The diffident , near-sighted composer Was perhaps best // Shostakovich , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes with the Fifth Symphony , composed the next year . This symphony , with the possible exception of the First , is the most popular work that Shostakovich ever composed . In 1946 , however , Shostakovich was called down by Culture and Life for his Ninth Symphony , described by that organ as too " playful and fanciful a trifle . " The argument ran that the symphony did not express the serious aims of the Soviet people . More serious was the rebuke that Shostakovich , Aram Khat- ' chaturian and Serge Prokofiev , together with four lesser composers , received on Feb. 11 , 1948 , from the Central Committee of the Communist party . Again Shostakovich 's work was declared " leftist " and an expression of " bourgeois decadence . " Shostakovich promised to " correct his mistakes . " Rebukes Withdrawn in 1957 In 1957 , the Central Committee 's rebuke of 1948 was officially reversed in a speech by Dimitri T. Shepilov , then Communist party secretary , to a congress of Soviet composers in Moscow , and Shostakovich and Khatchaturian were elected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United States three times .

He and a 17-member delegation arrived on March 23 and on March 29 were asked to go home by the State Departmeirt . The reason given was that the delegation had been admitted only for the three-day session of the conference . Many citizens and publications had attacked the conference as a " Red front . " In October , 1959 , Shostakovich arrived for a much more meaningful visit of a month , which had been worked out under the cultural exchange agreement between the United States and the Soviet Union . He came with four other composers ? Tikhon Khrennikov , Dimitri Kabalevsky , Konstantin Dankevich and Fikret Amirov  --  and a critic and musicologist , Boris Yarustovsky .

Wrangle Over a Score Perhaps the most publicized episode in relation to Shostakovich 's music came with the American premiere of his Seventh , or " Leningrad , " Symphony , a work that lasts about 80 minutes .

Just rights to his Eighth Symphony . because one work is criticized Shostakovich 's musical style changed but little from that shown in his astonishing First Symphony , and there were those who maintained that he never composed a better work . All of the elements of his style were already apparent  --  the wide melodic skips , the purposeful dissonances , the scherzolike dance tunes and unexpected harmonic ' juxtapositions , and the frequent marchlike sections . His music also was characterized by long , slow movements , usually in largo tempo , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which his detractors called so much pompous nonsense .

A review appears on September , 1968 , Issue of Neva , a Leningrad literary journal , noted that Shostakovich 's " personality and life are not well known to us ? it- is not a question of his life , which was uneventful , but the inner biography of the man . Shostakovich does not belong to those who willingly share their thoughts , reminisce , or who open widely the doors of their creative workshops .

About his work he says very // known among ordinary Russians for his " Leningrad " Symphony , which was written during World War II to honor that city 's spirited resistance to the Nazi siege .

Though no family details have been given here , Shostalovich is understood to be survived by his widow , Irina ; a son , Maxim , who is a concert pianist and conductor , and a daughter , Galina , a biologist . The younger Mr. Shostakovich was reported to be canceling a conducting tour in Australia to return home . No plans have been announced for the funeral . Wrote Symphony at 191 As a composer , Dmitri Shostakovich literally exploded into fame with his First Symphony , composed in 1925 at the age of 9 , when he was still a student at the Leningrad Conservatory . The score was first played on May 12 , 1926 , as his diploma piece , and from that time on the young Russian composer was steadily in the news . Shostakovich , who was born in St. Petersburg ( now Leningrad ) on Sept. 25 , 1906 , was - by far the most publicized and famous of contemporary Soviet composers . Part of this was due to the striking nature of his music , part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nineteen-twenties , thirties and early forties . Shostakovich was a child of the Russian Revolution . He had been brought up and conditioned by the Soviet ideology , and considered his music an exptession of the Russian people , in line with the doctrines espoused by the Central Committee of the U.S.S.R. Thus his music became a rallying point for left-wing intellectuals in Europe and America . During the Depression his influence was strongest . ' Even so , the composer could not always keep in the good graces of the Communist party . His first breach came with the opera , " Lady Macbeth of Mzensk . " Made Public Apologies This opera , which had aroused great curiosity and , in some quarters , antagonism when it had been performed at the Metropolitan Opera House on Feb. 5. 1935 , by Artur Rodzinski , the Cleveland Orchestra and a group of singers , was the subject of an article in Pravda , in Febraury , 1936 . Pravda called the work " un-Soviet , eccentric and leftist . " Upon his return home he said he found the experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ casual demeanor of an audience lounging on the floor must , he thought , instill a " neglectful attitude " toward serious music . Shostakovich did not join the Communist party until 1960 , and his ups-and-downs with it did not end when he did . His Symphony No. 13 was suppressed by former Premier Nikita S. Khrushchev in 1963 because it included poems by Yevgeny Yevtushenko that dealt harshly with anti-Semitism . That same year , however , a revised version of the oncescandalous " Lady Macbeth of Mzensk " was produced in Moscow with official and popular approval . Retitled " Katerina Ismailova , " the new version of the opera was introduced here by the New York City Opera on March 4 , 1965 . On Sept. 24 , 1966 , the eve of his 60th birthday , Shostakovich was given two of the Soviet Union 's highest awards . One was the Hero of Socialist Labor title , the other the Order of Lenin . The following day , at a festive birthday concert given in Moscow , composer Dmitri Kabalevsky referred to Shostakovich as " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Shostakovich responded by making " shy and clumsy bows as usual .

His grandfather had been exiled to Siberia for participation in a Polish liberation movement , but his father returned to St. Petersburg and became a chemist in a Government bureau of weights and measures . Shostakovich studied piano as a small boy and showed an interest in composing by the time he was 11 years old . He was 13 when he entered the conservatory of his native city . Aleksandr Glazunoff was conservatory director at the time , and a writer has recalled that a familiar sight in the school corridors was that of the fat , expansive composer deep in conversation with a small , bony student with thin lips , the boy Shostakovich . His father died before Shostakovich graduated from the conservatory , and the youth earned the money for his studies by playing the piano @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1923 and was graduated as a composer in 1925 . In appearance , Shostakovich retained a boyish quality most of his life . Thin , bespectacled , studious-looking , with a heavy lock of hair generally dangling over his forehead , he had nothing esoteric about his appearance . He liked sports  --  volleyball , tennis and soccer football  --  and played a good game of chess . Showed Little Temperament He had a spacious apartment in Moscow and a pleasant country home about 30 miles from Moscow that he rented from the Soviet Government . Although he was a chainsmoker and rather nervous in , his movements , he was not temperamental and could compose as easily in the city as in the country . He worked quickly , usually composing without a piano and notating his ideas directly on the score . He was a brilliant pianist and frequently played solo parts in premieres of his own works . Whether in or out of favor with the Communist party , he does not mean that orchestras stop playing the others . And I go on writing and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Link With Yevtushenko While the composer 's Symphony No. 13 was a setting of Yevgeny Yevtushenko poems that brought on Premier Khrushchev 's displeasure , and No. 14 was in effect a song cycle rather than a symphony , his 15th saw a return to his old style . It was given its New York premiere in October , 1972 , by Eugene Ormandy and the Philadelphia Orchestra . Harold C. Schonberg , music critic of The New York Times , called the work a pastiche , in a way , of familiar themes and unconvincing . " The materials are weak , " Mr. Schonberg wrote , " practiced as the hand may be . " Mr. Shostakovich suffered a heart attack in 1966 , when he Page 33 .
