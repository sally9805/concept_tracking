When Sue Raffety was attending high school in Blackwell , Okla. , in the 1950s , she and her classmates wore heavily caked makeup and ruby-red lipstick . " It looked like hell , " recalls Raffety , " and hurt our skin . At the time , however , we thought we were glamorous . " Like many women , Raffety has done , well , an about-face on cosmetology , and today she prizes those products that help foster a fresh , natural appearance . As the senior reporter-researcher in the Economy and Business section , Raffety suggested and worked on this week 's cover story about one of the cosmetics industry 's largest retail companies , Revlon , and its president , Michel Bergerac . <P> The assignment proved to be alluring . Raffety splashed on dozens of perfumes , smeared herself with lotions and creams and spread on a rainbow of lipsticks and eye shadows . To prepare for her first interview with the president of Revlon , she visited a midtown Manhattan skin-care salon and underwent a one-hour facial that included a massage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ topped off the treatment with a professional makeup job . " A session like that one can change your whole feeling about the world , " says Raffety . <P> Reporting on an industry redolent of mystery and the exotic , Raffety was most fascinated by Bergerac himself . Her explanation : " I always suspected that people in this business were somewhat artificial-speaking with broad accents , for example , or constantly using endearments like ' darling . ' Bergerac could not be more genuine : he is warm and friendly without being mushy , and he possesses a quick , dry sense of humor . I especially enjoyed watching him on his farm as he fed lettuce to his goat Dudley and played with his two baby lambs . Bergerac is as comfortable in the woods as in his Fifth Avenue office . " <P> For Senior Writer George Church , who expounds on trade deficits and inflation spirals with ease , the story of Bergerac and the beauty business turned out to be one of his toughest covers yet . <P> " The dollar I understand , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Smoky Mauve look ? " Exactly the way , we hope you 'll agree , that Church describes it in a cover story that turned out to be as much fun for him as for Sue Raffety.
