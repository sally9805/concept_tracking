Official Washington has often seemed to be an employment agency for the Ivy League . Even before Franklin Delano Roosevelt brought down all those bright young men from Harvard , Yale and Princeton , graduates of the Big Three and the other Ivy schools were almost beyond counting in Government . There are still hordes of them around , but after seven years of Republican rule in the White House , so many men and women from the University of Chicago have moved into Government 's command structure that Washington has begun to talk about " a University of Chicago Mafia . " <P> Among its most important members : Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens , Attorney General Edward Levi , Agriculture Secretary Earl Butz ( though he only studied at Chicago for a summer en route to a doctorate from Purdue ) , Solicitor General Robert H. Bork , Presidential Adviser Robert Goldwin and Librarian of Congress Daniel Boorstin . The biggest representation is at the State Department , an almost exclusively Eastern preserve until after World War II . Now Chicago takes credit for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Deputy Secretary of State who was educated at Yale but is a trustee at Chicago , its No. 3 man , Under Secretary for Political Affairs Joseph S. Sisco , at least eight ambassadors , and a dozen top-level assistants to high-ranking officials . <P> The Chicagoans in the Administration have numerous alumni allies in Congress : Senators Roman Hruska of Nebraska , Gale McGee of Wyoming , Charles Percy of Illinois and Abraham Ribicoff of Connecticut ; Representatives Abner Mikva of Illinois and Patsy Mink of Hawaii ; and House Parliamentarian William Brown . <P> Government officials with a Chicago connection range broadly from one end of the political spectrum to the other . Says Gale McGee : " The only school tie that carries over is in conversation at cocktail parties . There 's no real affinity . " Adds Marcus Raskin , a Chicago alumnus who directs the Institute for Policy Studies , an ultraliberal think tank : " The people from the university literally do n't know each other here . Chicago 's position was always as an outsider from among the ruling elite of American schools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and they see themselves as making it on their own . There 's a sense of great arrogance . " <P> Strong Cadre . Nonetheless , the university 's impact has been felt in a number of ways . During the Nixon Administration , the President and his top economic advisers embraced the monetarist theories of conservative Chicago Economist Milton Friedman . Chicago Political Scientist Leo Strauss impressed several generations of students with his vision of the general leftward trend of world politics . One of these students was Robert Goldwin , who now serves as President Ford 's resident intellectual .
