Few diseases are more feared than cholera , which in past centuries has decimated whole populations . Cholera is endemic to many Asian nations , where sanitation is poor and water supplies are contaminated . But the disease also maintains a tenuous toehold in the West . Last week it was frightening Italy , where the death toll had risen to at least 21 , and threatening other European countries as well . <P> Their concern is well founded , because the effects of cholera can be catastrophic . The disease is caused by comma-shaped bacteria that thrive in contaminated water supplies . The bugs do even better in the human intestine . <P> There they multiply rapidly , triggering vomiting and devastating diarrhea that can drain off as much as 25% of the body 's fluid in hours , depleting it of essential salts and causing dehydration , kidney failure and circulatory collapse . <P> Treatment involves intensive replacement of lost fluids and infusions of salts to restore the body 's water and chemical balance . It is almost always effective . But without prompt medical attention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ current outbreak began late last month in Naples , where it afflicted 94 victims and killed at least ten . Cases of cholera cropped up in the Adriatic port of Bari . The disease erupted in Rome , and finally leaped the Tyrrhenian Sea to Sardinia . By week 's end , cases had been reported in Florence and as far north as Bologna and Milan . <P> Health Ministry officials blamed the outbreak ( at week 's end it had not yet reached epidemic proportions ) not on contaminated drinking water , but on shellfish . Most of the victims , they explained , had eaten mussels , which were apparently taken from polluted waters around Italy and in North Africa . To prevent the disease from spreading any further , officials banned the sale and importation of shellfish throughout Italy and ordered large mussel beds in the Bay of Naples destroyed . <P> No Vaccine . In an effort to calm the jumpy public , officials ordered that streets and storefronts in Rome and Naples be washed down with disinfectant -a strategy designed largely to provide psychological , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by medics from the U.S. Sixth Fleet , managed to immunize at least 85% of Naples ' 1,278,000 people against the disease . <P> But the program failed to reassure many Italians . In Torre del Greco , a city of 83,000 on the Bay of Naples , some 500 people who could not be immunized because the vaccine supply ran out marched on the municipal building and had to be dispersed by police . <P> Fearing the spread of the disease , health officials in several countries began demanding that travelers returning from Italy show certificates of immunization against cholera . That action apparently is not enough to halt the march of the disease . Scattered cases have already been reported in Sweden , Britain , France and West Germany . The majority of those stricken in Northern European countries have not even been to Italy . Most appeared to have picked up the disease in North Africa .
