txt The battle for Vietnam is far from over and the outcome is still in some doubt , but at top levels in Washington there is rising confidence . This is partly because Saigon has not panicked and its troops have not run away . Also , the conviction grows that Washington has more to gain and less to lose than Moscow , no matter how it all comes out . The worst that can happen ( from the Washington point of view ) is a collapse of the Saigon regime . If that happened , Mr. Nixon would be going to Moscow five weeks from now in a weaker bargaining position . But even then , he still has the enormous leverage of his new relationship with Peking . The men of the Kremlin could of course regain some of their losses by a dramatic Hanoi victory , but not even that on top of their win in India ( over Bangladesh ) could begin to make up for what they lost in the way of world leverage on the day Richard Nixon was received in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other side of the coin is even more interesting . Hanoi has staked just about everything it has on the outcome of the offensive in South Vietnam . There are 15 divisions in Hanoi 's " main - force " Arriiy . Pattern of diplomacy Twelve of those now are committed and engaged in the fighting in the south . One more is moving south . It 's now about half way between Hanoi and the DMZ . The remaining two are training divisions . In other words , this is a " go for broke " affair for Hanoi . They have committed to this battle the men they have been training for some five years ; the best Russian equipment they have been accumulating for the same period of time ; and all that they have been moving south over the last year through the heaviest curtain of bombing the United States could lay down . Five years from now For Hanoi this is it . Either they arm big , or lose big . This is not something they could repeat every year . If they fail now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kind of striking power they are using now . And would Russia give them the equipment for another try  --  five years from now ? Unless Hanoi wins big , Mr. Nixon wins . It takes only a failure of the Hanoi offensive to make this a major success for Vietnamization . If those 12 divisions now in the south have to go back home without decisive victory , the Thieu regime in Saigon gets at least another four or five years of security . Washington planning has all along been on the assumption that if the Thieu regime holds out into the next rainy season  --  it wins . That next rainy , season will have started by the time Mr. Nixon gets to Moscow . It is already starting . The fighting is mostly under a heavy cloud cover which is impeding American air power . // *Hanoi plays its trump card and weakens Moscow 's hand // But by May 22 it will also be impeding the attackers . The chances are steadily rising that by the time Mr. Nixon reaches Moscow the fighting in Vietnam will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evidence now is deemed conclusive that the offensive was launched by Hanoi over the strongest Russian protests for two overriding ( to Hanoi ) reasons . First , time is running out on them . Either they win now , or Saigon has another six months of time in which to stabilize and train and consolidate . Mr. Thieu and his whole regime gets stronger by the day . It would be harder for Hanoi to win next dry season than now . Moscow aid in doubt Second , there is no certainty that Hanoi would get any further military aid from Moscow and Peking during the next six months . And there could be no certainty in Hanoi about what happens in Moscow when Mr. Nixon gets there . America 's clients are anxious on that point . But Hanoi must be more anxious . After all , what is to prevent the Russians from selling out Hanoi for the sake of a deal with Mr. Nixon over things much more important to Russia ? The net of it is that for Hanoi this was decisive victory which would give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ control over the whole of Vietnam and the enormous prestige of having won a major bout against the American giant . A ' force in being ' But a corollary of a Hanoi victory would be more independence for Hanoi . Neither Moscow nor Peking would be able to control it . Such an outcome would not be to Moscow 's advantage . Until this offensive was launched Hanoi 's " main force " army was a powerful " force in being . " It was bargaining power in any negotiation . Had it remained a " force in being " through the Nixon visit in Moscow , the Russians could have used the threat of it to advantage in their dealings with Mr. Nixon . The ability to unleash or leash it would be a major trading item . But once that force is launched into battle , Moscow has lost all ability to use it in a deal with Mr. Nixon . It has been played . It ca n't be played again . If it is used up in a military failure , nothing is left of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Hanoi before the Moscow trip measures Hanoi 's distrust of Moscow . Obviously , Mr. Nixon hopes for a decisive Saigon success before he goes to Moscow . But even if he does not get that dividend , he is ahead of the game from the mere fact that Hanoi took responsibility for its own affairs out of Moscow 's hands .
