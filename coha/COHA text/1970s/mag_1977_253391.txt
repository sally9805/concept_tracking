The perils of stop-go <P> In its efforts to keep the economy expanding steadily and avoid inflation , the Federal Reserve Board strives to hold the annual increase in money supply with-in a narrow range-at present , 4% to 6% . Yet for most of the past year , money growth has been riding a wild roller coaster-dropping all the way down to zero in one month , soaring to an annual rate of almost 20% in another . In the past few months , the money supply has been swelling at such a fevered rate as to cause anxiety even among powerful congressional Democrats , who usually favor an easy-money policy . <P> The sharpest critic is Wisconsin Democrat Henry S. Reuss , the scholarly chairman of the House Banking Committee . In a letter hand-carried by an aide to Federal Reserve Chairman Arthur Burns two weeks ago , Reuss charges that the board " has lost control of the money supply . " Reuss perceives at least two dangers to the economy : 1 ) " a real threat of nourishing inflation in 1978 , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may sell shares out of fear that the board will have to slam on the brakes suddenly . <P> In the five months from April to August , the basic money supply ( cash plus checking accounts ) has grown at an annual rate of as little as .7% , but twice it has topped 18% . Despite the stop-go gyrations , the monthly rate has averaged almost 10% . For a while the rise seemed to be moderating in August , but in the last week of that month the money stock ballooned by $3 billion , jolting many analysts . Then in the week ending Sept. 7 , money supply took a header , dropping by a dizzying $800 million . <P> Why the runaway rise and fall ? Some money-market analysts suspect that Burns and his colleagues may simply have misjudged the strength of the recovery , and pumped out more than the economy needed or could use . A more technical reason is an increase in money " velocity " - the speed at which money moves from checking account to checking account . Critics fault the Fed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grow more quickly than it wished . <P> Beryl Sprinkel , executive vice president of Harris Trust &; Savings Bank in Chicago and a member of TIME 's Board of Economists , suggests a third reason : the Fed sets targets for both money-supply growth and interest rates , and it has had great difficulty in choosing goals that are consistent with each other . For example , it may try to keep the " Fed funds " rate - the rate on reserves that banks lend to each other-at around 6% . But it may then find that in order to prevent the rate from rising above that , it has to pump reserves into the banking system , and that increases the money supply more than it intended . <P> The board is now trying to restrain the growth of money ; in consequence , interest rates are rising . Last week it let demand for money push the Fed funds ' rate as high as 6% , instead of pumping cash into banks to stop the rise . Other short-term rates are going up too .

Three-month U.S. Treasury bills , which traded at 5.57% during the first week this month , climbed last week to about 5.8%.
