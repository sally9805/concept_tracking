Among those indicted is Sister Elizabeth Me A lister , 31 , a cheery , impulsive New Yorker , who took her vows in 1966 as a member of the order of the Religious of the Sacred Heart of Mary . Sister Elizabeth has been an art-history teacher at Marymount College in Tarry town , N.Y . Last week she talked with TIME Correspondent Robert Anson about her life , the peace movement and the charges against her : <P> CALL her Liz , she asked , or Sister Elizabeth , anything but Sister Lizzie , which everyone calls her , and makes her sound so young . Her father , a prosperous contractor who is now dead , and her mother came from Ireland in the early ' 20s ; she was a twin in a family of nine . There is scant sympathy at home for her work in the peace movement . When her youngest brother brought the bail money to free her last week , he told her that the family thought that she had probably done everything the Government charged her with " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young Marymount instructor , Sister Elizabeth was assigned the task of maintaining the college 's current events bulletin board . The daily headlines she tacked up became talismans on her private path toward pacifism . " By 1964 I was going to New York City once a month for some kind of meeting or demonstration , " she recalls . In September of that year , Dan Berrigan came to Marymount to say Mass and speak ; for Elizabeth , he was revelatory . " What Dan was saying very beautifully was what I had been thinking and never been able to articulate . " She did not meet him until 1966 , when she was introduced by her provincial superior . " Dan was always somebody at a distance , " says Sister Elizabeth . " Phil was an easy man to know and like .

" I just started feeling that our Government was n't giving us the truth , that it was saying things to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be wrong . " She came to believe that " people have to take responsibility for their Government and what it does . Change is only going to be accomplished by bringing people to the point of consciousness that they change their own lives . " - <P> Was there a plot as charged ? " I 'm not going to answer that . " Then consider a theoretical question . What if all the nonviolent tactics had been exhausted and none of them worked and the only way things were going to change was through violence ? Could she approve of that ? " I ca n't answer . That is going too close to the heart of the matter . " She is determined not to discuss the trial , not even to deny her guilt , until she has seen and talked to the other defendants . " The group is involved . We are responsible for one another . It is a Spartacist thing . " She explains that in the film Spartacus , the Romans demand of the captured rebels that Spartacus identify himself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and replies , " I am Spartacus.
