A most amiable event <P> From a distant hill , the 40-mile-long multicolored ribbon , snaking through the Iowa cornfields , looks like the ultimate outdoor crazy sculpture . At hub and t-shirt level it turns out to be the American version of the Tour de France-sans hype , heartbreak , commercials , competition or prizes . It is the annual amateur week-long bicycle marathon from the Missouri to the Mississippi , as amiable a happening as any to be found in the U.S. <P> The event , sponsored by the Des Moines Register , is known as Ragbrai ( pronounced rag-bray ) , for the Register 's Annual Great Bike Ride Across Iowa . Last week , for the sixth and biggest Ragbrai run , some 5,500 bikers started from the Big Muddy at Sioux City and set out east across the lush , gently rolling heartland to dunk front wheels seven days later in the Father of Rivers at Clinton . En route , along 440 miles of tranquil back-country roads , the sportive pedalers pumped and panted , munched , sang and slurped through 42 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Maquoketa , Alice and Viola . If it was an exhilarating experience for the bikers , saddle sores and all , the Ragbrai caravan-accompanied by 500 four-wheel followers in cars , campers and motor homes-provided the event of the year for the sleepy communities it passed through . <P> Wheeling into Eagle Grove ( pop . 4,489 ) at 9:30 a.m. , dozens of thirsty bikers preempted the Alibi Lounge , chugalugging beers and cheering with every glass as if it were the last St. Patrick 's Day , later forming a conga line on Main Street . At midmorning , in Washta ( pop . 319 ) , Joyce Johnson and friends from the United Methodist Church sold 600 Ibs. of hamburger and 400 Ibs. of hot dogs , 1,500 pieces of fruit , 7,000 candy bars and close to 280 cases of soda ( no beer ) ; the women figured on a $2,000 profit for the church . Outside Iowa Falls ( pop . 6,454 ) , Robert Eddy and pals set up a keg of suds in his van with a sign proclaiming FREE BEER . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lions Club put on a spread ( ham sandwiches , apples , homemade cookies , hot dogs ) outside the elementary school , members thoughtfully spiked rolls of toilet paper on fence posts bordering the usefully protective 8-ft. - tall rows of corn . Night after night from the instant campgrounds across Iowa arose a bizarre melange of aromas : marijuana , freshly baked cookies , barbecues , sweat and suntan oil . Some folks thought the fragrance should be bottled . Essence de Ragbrai ? <P> Who would pump away a sweltering midsummer week in Iowa , when beaches and lakes and Laker beckon ? Just about anyone , according to TIME 'S Midwest Bureau Chief Benjamin Gate , who monitored the cornbelt caravan , part of it on a borrowed ten-speed Gitane bike . The Ragbrai army , he reports , comes from all over the U.S. and from every way of life and income bracket . On the road , its members fall into five loose categories : <P> The Bike Nuts , who pedal $1,000 coinage machines , complete a 70-mile leg in five hours or less and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that no one ever sees them , and they see nothing of the scenery . " <P> The Amiable Amateurs , who ride bikes year round but see the Ragbrai as the big annual adventure and stamina test .
