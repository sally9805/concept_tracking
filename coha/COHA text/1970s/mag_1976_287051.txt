No monument stands over Babi Yar ; A drop sheer as a crude gravestone . - Yevgeni Yevtushenko , Babi Yar . <P> <P> For three decades poets , writers , musicians and at least one politician in the Soviet Union have called for a monument to be built at Babi Yar , a desolate ravine near Kiev that is a worldwide symbol of Jewish martyrdom . There , on Sept. 29-30 , 1941 , a 150-man SS extermination team assembled the Jews of the German-occupied capital of the Ukraine , stripped them naked , lined them up on the edge of the ravine and machine-gunned them . Children were thrown into the ravine alive . The team halted only long enough to shovel sand over each layer of bodies . When the job was done 36 hours later , 33,771 Jews had perished-a record of efficiency unsurpassed even at Auschwitz . By the time the Germans were driven from Kiev in 1943 , 100,000 to 200,000 Jews and non-Jews had been murdered at Babi Yar . <P> Silent Screams . Yet all efforts to memorialize the victims foundered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particular targets of the Nazis . The postwar party chief in the Ukraine , Nikita Khrushchev , publicly promised to erect a monument at Babi Yar , but his plan was forestalled by Stalin 's anti-Semitic drives . Even after Khrushchev himself took power in Moscow , Babi Yar remained a refuse-strewn wasteland . Poet Yevtushenko was fiercely rebuked for singling out Jews as victims of the massacre . So was Composer Dimitri Shostakovich , who made Babi Yar a theme of his 13th Symphony . Soviet Jews seeking to commemorate the massacre 's anniversary have been jailed by local police . <P> Still , last summer construction of a monument near the ravine began . Yet now that the work has been completed , it is clear that there has still been no policy reversal in the Kremlin . Standing 50 ft. high , the memorial consists of eleven bronze statues representing such figures as a Communist guerrilla fighter , a Red Army soldier with clenched fist , and a sailor shielding an old woman . A plaque reads : " Here in 1941-1943 the German Fascist invaders executed over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Jews are nowhere mentioned or portrayed , thus underscoring rather than answering Yevtushenko 's plaint : " Everything here screams in silence .
