LATE LAST FALL , to the accompaniment of a loud and sus-tained media fanfare , New York was presented with the Lerican premiere of Einstein on the sch , an " opera in four acts " by Rob-Wilson and Philip Glass . Advance &city; and newspaper reports said work had been enthusiastically re-'ed in France , Italy , Yugoslavia , ; ium , Germany , and Holland . But igh Einstein became the media 's ural darling of the season , with ne-ations reported to present it in ; hington , D.C. , California , and Tex-ittle was written that came to grips the opera itself . There were , in. 1 , long stories on its technical com-ities , with paeans to the crew at New York Metropolitan Opera se and to the Wilson-Glass troupe its physical endurance and mim-ic ability in staging the five-hour uction ( a shorter Wilson epic . one s previous efforts , took twelve hours ! rform ) . ' ter the first performance , critics at pains to say that " What is it t ? " was the one question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one 's remaining outside erms of the experience , of being , implied , a cultural hick . little puzzled , we went to the seeerformance . According to the pro-notes , the opera was conceived by rt Wilson and composer Philip , with choreography by Andrew oat . Wilson directed and designed ! Ls and Glass wrote the music , and . The opera has nine scenes in four There are also five of what Wilnd Glass call " knee plays . " Two sed to open and close the work , hinge the acts . The knee plays use ' - ph Spieler is an editor and critic . two actors who continuously repeat phrases and gestures to the accompaniment of a droning electronic organ . The effect , similar to staring at a closed loop of recorded videotape , is to lull the audience and wear down its expectations . There is then some comfort , as well as occasional change , in Glass 's heavily amplified score . The music is constructed , not of melody or atonality , but of repeated bits of musical matter , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repeatedly typing a single letter , or series of letters , to a required pattern . The title Einstein on the Beach has no literal meaning . Images of Albert Einstein fill the work , but the closest we come to being " on the beach " is a conch shell that appears on stage right in several scenes . At one point an actress lifts it to her ear ; it is up to us to guess what she may have heard . Some critics thought the title referred to a civilization on the brink ( as in Nevil Shute 's On the Beach ) , or to Einstein 's love for sailing . There is no plot or action in the sense of traditional theater or opera . Instead , we are given a number of visual ideas or , more accurately , notions that are taken , often obscurely , from Einstein 's life and the effects his work had on the world . Some of the notions are obvious ; others assume a more than passing knowledge of the scientist . In any event , none is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them as they go by . These references include Einstein 's love for fiddling on the violin , for steam engines ( a steam locomotive and a train are among the principal sets in the first two acts ) , his theoretical contribution to the atomic bomb and to space travel , and his exercise of pure reason . All these lead to the last scene , in which flashing lights , violent dancing , and loud , churning music hint at some sort of cosmic cataclysm set inside a space machine . Even this simple list , however , implies a specificity to the opera which it lacks . For instance , the longest visual reference in Einstein to his theoretical work is in act four : a high rectangular building on an empty plain , seen from its narrow front , but slightly angled to give an idea of its depth . Near the top of the building is a window and through it we see a man , his back to us . His right arm describes ceaseless writing motions on an imaginary surface in front of him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ building and spends its time looking up at the window . The first to arrive is a child on a skateboard ; as the crowd wanders off , he is the last to leave . The scene ends as it begins , a building set on a lonely plain ; through a high window we see a man , his right arm in motion . We assume the man is Einstein . Is the building Science ? Is he , in his furious scribbling , working out formulas that will save ? or destroy ? mankind ? Why does the building look more like a prison than a scientific institute ? Are scientists prisoners ? Whose ? The silent people who gather below ? are they prisoners of Science ? Are they kept away from Science ? ( The building is massive , it has no door that we can see , the scientist inside is too high to reach . ) One wants to know more , but feels embarrassed to ask . w II-SON 'S RACKGROUND as a painter is clear in Emir-stein . His sets are surrealistic , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also remembers yellows and greens . The play seems to have any number of visual references . The scene inside the space machine could be based on Fritz Lang 's Metropolis ; an entire scene is given over to a pillar of light tin an earlier scene it was a bed i that rises slowly from the floor until it disappears into space , like the monolith in Kubrick 's 2001 . There are allusions in the sets to Max Ernst and Giorgio de Chirico . Indeed , the foreboding quality of the Einstein building left a more lasting memory than the action in and outside it . Another set is of a locomotive that creeps ? in starts , stops , and reverses ? onto stage left , while on stage right a young boy launches paper airplanes from the top of a gantry . An even more enigmatic one is the last car of a train ( green and yellow ) that recedes slowly backstage . Behind the window of the interconnecting door , a man and a woman sit facing each other for some time before she draws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scene . Other sets are a courtroom , in chrome and white , that becomes a jail , complete with a spoken reference to Patty Hearst ; a white bed that becomes the ascending pillar of light ; a field of dancers above whom a circular " space machine " ( it looks like a tabletop humidifier ) moves on a gen. tle diagonal ; an enormous grid , filled with frenzied people and flashing lights ? the apocalyptic event inside the space machine . Glass 's music is not difficult to understand . and is often interesting , if terribly loud , ( " My main approach , " he writes in a program note , " has been to link harmonic structure directly to rhythmic structure , using the latter as a base .... Melodic material is for the most part a function , or result , of the harmony . " ) The music , built around sequential tones , is accompanied by lyrics that use , instead of words , numbers ( " one-two-three , one-two-three , onetwo-three ; one-two-three-four , one-two-three-four , one-two-three-four , " et @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The score , though no musical revelation , is far more concrete an experience than Wilson 's drama , a result of its spare nonmelodic concept . Einstein on the Bench adds up to distinctly less than the sum of its parts . One senses an innocent humanism at work here . From the dancing in the two " field " ( space machine ) scenes , one could gather that Wilson would like the human race to survive . It is a nice sentiment . but it is n't developed , and repetition flattens it to a veneer . One possible thread through the opera is a figure made up as Einstein ( as is , at times , the entire east ) . He appears in several scenes sitting on a raised chair between the orchestra and stage and fiddles ? continuously , loudly , lamentingly . He has neither facial expressions nor lines to speak . In a most unclarify ing note , Glass writes : " His playing position ... offers a clue to his role . We see him , then , perhaps as Einstein @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ events , but in any case , as a musical touchstone to the work as a whole . " All the elements of our universe are somehow connected , this opera seems to say ? Einstein ? **27;3241;TOOLONG Hearst ? space travel ? but if our universe is to survive , we must first learn to love . There 's nothing wrong with that , but without examination , development , without a hint of dialectic , it has all the force of a nice pop song ? " All You Need Is Love , " by the Beatles , comes to mind . As such , Einstein does n't begin to accommodate the epic scale of a five-hour opera . Anything can be art , if only because people calling themselves artists have done all sorts of things and called th art , and sooner or later critics and marketplace have responded to them art . Einstein is art , but a quite limi art of static visual images put to tion , not dissimilar from choosing series of interesting and pretty p cards and moving them , in accompi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one 's eyes . Almost all the New York critics t Einstein to their hearts , even if I did n't know what to make of it . Gussow in the Times , writing about opera as theater , came to the end of review still searching for a definit " ' Einstein on the Beach ' itself sr less a play or an opera than an o nism with its own pulsating hearts A reviewer for the Soho Weekly mastered the event by writing " Einstein on the Beach answers questions asked of it by showin how ridiculous questions are .
