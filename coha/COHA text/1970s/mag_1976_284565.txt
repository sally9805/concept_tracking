Newspapers and petroleum companies are not obvious and natural allies . So it came as a surprise to many Britons last week when the Sunday Observer ( circ. 668,000 ) , one of Fleet Street 's most literate papers , was purchased by the Atlantic Richfield Co. , a $7 billion Los Angeles-based oil giant . The token price : one pound sterling , or about $1.65 . <P> The man who put Atlantic Richfield in the newspaper business is Robert O. Anderson , 59 , Arco 's chairman . A part-time cattleman ( his 1 million acres of ranch land make him one of the nation 's largest individual landowners ) , philanthropist and self-styled student of social problems , Anderson is chairman of the Aspen Institute for Humanistic Studies , a social science think tank with offices round the world . <P> Serendipitous Supper . Last month Douglass Cater , who directs the institute 's communications program and once served as Washington editor of the now defunct Reporter magazine , was dining in London with an old friend , Observer Contributor Kenneth Harris . " Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Harris asked . The Observer , it turned out , had been losing as much as $1 million a year and recently laid off one-third of its staff . The paper 's owners , heirs of the second Lord Astor , were willing to hand over control to the right investor . Cater telephoned the Aspen Institute , which reached Anderson , and Anderson invited Observer Proprietor and former Editor David Astor to bring the paper 's books with him to Los Angeles . Last week , ten days after Cater 's serendipitous supper , Atlantic Richfield 's board approved the purchase ; the price reflected the reality that the oil company was acquiring financial liabilities , not profitable assets . <P> The Astors had received other bids for the Observer-from Fleet Street , four Arab countries and even a Hong Kong patent-medicine heiress . Until last week the leading suitor was Publisher Rupert Murdoch , the Australian whose three-continent newspaper empire includes London 's Sun and News of the World and who two weeks ago agreed to buy the New York Post . But the Astors were troubled that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their attention to sex and scandal , and Murdoch would not guarantee editorial independence to Observer editors . <P> Anderson would , in writing , and he also promised that Atlantic Richfield would spend an undisclosed sum-believed to be as much as $10 million-to improve the paper and expand news coverage . " We do not propose to change the paper 's editorial policy , " said Anderson . " Our intention is solely to provide support for the Observer , one of the world 's outstanding newspapers . " <P> Anderson may have a couple of other intentions : to score a public relations coup for his company and acquire a direct pipeline to Britain 's ruling elite . Founded in 1791 , the Observer has published some well-known British writers - George Orwell , Arnold Toynbee and , posthumously , Evelyn Waugh-and taken a few risks along the way . The paper was persecuted by the Crown for reporting the secret trial of the Cato Street conspirators in 1820 , and alienated many readers by denouncing the British invasion of Suez in 1956.        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
