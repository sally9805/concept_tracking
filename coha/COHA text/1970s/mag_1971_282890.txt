Sometimes wittingly , sometimes not , California 's Governor Ronald Reagan has turned quite a few memorable phrases in his brief political career . Reagan was cracking the quip again when he announced that he would lead a delegation pledged to President Nixon at next year 's Republican Convention-and thus forgo for the time being any presidential ambitions of his own . Of New York Mayor John Lindsay 's plaint that his is the second toughest job in the world , Reagan said that it probably was- " the way he does it . " George McGovern , Reagan said , " is testing the water , probably to see if Teddy can walk on it . " The Democrats , Reagan concluded , " want to turn the country around : they may not have cured poverty , but they sure cured wealth . "
