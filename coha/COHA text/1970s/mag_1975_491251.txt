He " slept soundly until shortly after four o'clock , " as he later put it  --  actually . it was three-fifteen -- -and went into the Lincoln Sitting Room off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turntable : Rachmaninofrs First Piano Concerto , Eugene Ormandy conducting the Philadelphia Orchestra , Philippe Entremont , solo  --  ist . Manolo Sanchez , his valet , heard the music and soon appeared in a bathrobe to ask if the President wanted anything . The President , standing at the window looking at the small groups of students beginning to gather on the grounds of the Washington Monument , , aid no . Then he asked , " Have you ever been to the Lincoln Memorial at tight ? " Sanchez said no . " Get your clothes on , we 'll go . " They dressed ; at four-thirty-five they went out on the South Lawn of the White House , facing the Ellipse and Washington Monument . Egil ( " Bud " ) Krogh , who worked for the Domestic Council on matters affecting the Department of Justice , was at a Secret Service Command Post in the Peace Corps ' building when he heard the loudspeaker squawk : " Searchlight is on the lawn . " Moments later : " Searchlight has asked for a car . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home , then told his boss that the President was about to go out . Ehrlichman suggested Krogh go over to the White House lawn , introduce himself , and ask if he could be of assistance . Krogh arrived too late at the lawn and followed the President to the Lincoln Memorial . The President , who dictated a diary note later that he had never seen the Secret Service so " petrified with apprehension , " had insisted when he or  --  dered the car that nobody on his staff or in the press be informed of his plans . When Krogh , and later Ron Ziegler , showed up at the Lincoln Continued on page 87 // Before the Fall continued from peg* 43 Memorial , Nixon assumed with some irritation that they had disobeyed his instructions . In fact , they had not ; Krogh had overheard the flash . The President and Manolo got out of the car and walked up the long flight of steps toward the Memorial . Along with the inscription over the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier , the President said in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lincoln Memorial is the most unforgettable : " In this temple , as in the hearts of the people for . whom he saved the Union , the memory of Abraham Lincoln is enshrined forever . " After looking at the Gettysburg and Second Inaugural words on the walls , the President walked over to a group of about eight stu ? ment was picking up a soft shade of pink . There was a haziness about the morning , and the profound quiet of the Lincoln Memorial blended beau  --  tifully with the changing morning colors . " One of the students told the Pres  --  ident they had not been able to hear the press conference because they had been driving to Washington for the demonstration . The President said he was sorry they missed it , be  --  cause he had tried to explain that his goals in Vietnam were the same as their own  --  to stop the killing and end the war . Not to get into Cam  --  bodia , but to get out of Vietnam . This was met with silence , The President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but that he hoped that they would not allow disagreement on that issue to lead them to fail to give him a hearing on other issues . He particu  --  larly hoped that their hatred of the war would not turn into a hatred of our whole system . " 1 know that probably most of you think I 'm an S.O.B. , but I want you to know that I understand just how you feel . " He recalled when he left law school , just before he was married , how excited he was when he listened on the radio to Neville Chamber  --  lain 's return from Munich with " peace in our time . " " I had so little in those days , " the President told the group of students , " that the prospect of going into the service was almost unbearable , and I felt the United States ' staying out of any kind of conflict was worth pay  --  ing any price whatever . " As a Qua  --  ker , he was close at the time to being a pacifist , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Chamber  --  lain , " I thought Churchill was a mad  --  man . " In retrospect , he said , he knew he was wrong . Chamberlain was a good man , but Churchill was a wiser one , even though there was a time when Churchill was extremely unpopular because of his " anti-peace " stand . Nixon then tried to move the con versation into areas where he could draw the students out . Travel was a good subject to start dents , all men , half from upstate New York . He asked the usual ques  --  tions about where they were from and how old they were , what they were studying , and said he hoped they would take in some of the oth  --  er memorials while they were in Washington , though this was his fa  --  vorite . He said he had n't been at the Lincoln Memorial at night for ten years , but he 'd awakened early after his press conference and wanted Manolo to see it . The group grew to about twenty-five . A Krogh memo for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It was very quiet , even hushed , and the President was speaking in a very low , conversational tone to the students , really in with them , not out in front talking to them . He asked one girl where she was from and she replied , Los Altos , Cali  --  fornia . He then gestured about the hills around the town and indicated that he knew about it . The students were all very quiet , dressed in old blue jeans , some army jackets with wild , outlandish hairdos . I asked one of the girls if any of them had had some sleep and she said no . Many of them indi  --  cated that they had just come to town and did n't know where they could sleep . turned around , " wrote Krogh , " and looked out from the Memorial and saw that the Washington Monu ? with . When one of the young men said he could n't afford to trav  --  el , the President said that 's what he thought when he was young , but that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to Cen  --  tral America with his wife . " If you wait until you can afford it , you 'll be too old to enjoy it . " He urged them to start with the United States , particularly the West , and that got him talking about Indians . " What we have done with the American Indians is in its way just as bad as what we imposed on Negroes . We took a proud and independent race and virtually de  --  stroyed them . We have to find ways to bring them back into decent lives in this country . " The President ex  --  pressed concern to the students  --  all white  --  about the way that blacks are separating from whites on college campuses . " You must find a way to commu  --  nicate with the blacks in your universities , " Talking to the girl from Los Altos , Cali  --  fornia , he moved the conversation to the en  --  vironment . Right below where he lived in Cali  --  fornia , he recounted , there was a fine surfing beach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rine Corps property . He had turned this into a public beach -- one ex  --  ample of his campaign to put Government property to better uses Continued on page 106 continued from page 87 than military . Most of the group nodded in approval . He then said that it was one of his great hopes that during his admin  --  istration " the great mainland of China would be opened up so that we could know the seven hundred million people who live in China and who are one of the most remarkable people on earth . " Another nod of approval . He surveyed India ? " ter  --  ribly poor , but with a history and philosophical background and a mystique which we should try to u n d erst and " ; Malaysia ? " you 're right , we do have a Peace Corps there " ; and the Soviet Union . When a girl asked what Moscow was like , the President replied , " Gray . If you really want to know Russia , its exciting variety and his  --  tory , you must go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  ing there , he said , since they were not so much under the domination of the central government . While talking about cities , he commended to them Prague and Warsaw ; to an architectural student he suggested Novosibirsk , a raw , new city in the heart of Siberia , and Samarkand , where the people are Asians . One of the students wanted to know if she could get a visa to such cities ; the President said he was sure they could and if they contacted his office he would help out . That got a quick chuckle . What really mattered , said the President , coming to the point he wanted to leave with them , was not so much the architecture of the cit  --  ies , or the air pollution , or other ma  --  terial concerns . Travel , he felt , brought them in contact with the character of a people . The Haitians , for example , while poor , had a dig  --  nity and grace so moving that he wanted to return to see them . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is important that the stu  --  dents should not become alienated from the people of their own coun  --  try , with their great variety and char  --  acter . The group had grown and now included some older and less awe  --  struck members . One said , " I hope you realize that we are willing to die for what we believe in . " " Certainly , I realize that , " the President said . " Do you realize that many of us , when we were your age , were also willing to die for what we believed in , and are willing to do so today ? The point is that we are try  --  ing to build a world in which you will not have to die for what you believe in . " This got across , but when he began to point out how strategic arms limitation talks were progress  --  ing , he could see he was losing their attention . A girl , in a kind of delayed reaction to what had been said earli  --  er , said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that she was more interested in what kind of life we build in the United States . Nixon countered by pointing out that the purpose of discussing Prague and other places was not to discuss places but people . In the next twen  --  ty-five years , with the world getting smaller , he said , it was important that Americans know and under  --  stand people all over the world , be  --  ginning with the people in our own country . He tried again to make his central point : " I know the great emphasis that is currently being put on the environment  --  the necessity to have clear air , clean water , clean streets . " The President quickly reviewed his commitment to environmental pro  --  grams . " But you must remember that something that is completely clean can also be completely sterile and without spirit . What we must all think about is why we are here , what are those elements of the spirit that really matter . Honestly , I do n't have the answer , but I know that young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was searching forty years ago . But I want to be sure all of you realize that ending the war and cleaning up the streets and air and water are not going to solve the spir  --  itual hunger that all of us have  --  which has been the great mystery of life from the beginning of time . " Through the last twenty minutes of conversation , Manolo had come up several times to murmur that the President had a telephone call in his car ; as the crowd began to mount , the Secret Service was getting even more concerned , and was especiallyworried about the rally leadership getting wind of the visit . The Presi  --  dent shook hands , said he had to go , and walked down the steps into the dawn . Krogh , in his memo for the Pres ident 's record , picks up the story : " As we walked down the steps from the Memorial , a young man with wild , shaggy hair and a red beard darted down the steps to our left tak ing pictures of the President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bottom of the steps , the President motioned him over , and he came rather happily not knowing quite what to expect . The President asked him to hand his camera to Dr. Walter Tkach , which he did , and Dr. Tkach took a picture of the President and the young man on the third or fourth step up from the bottom by the street . The President then spent some time talking to the man , and you could see by the proximity of the President to each person he talked to that there was a deep effort to reach out and into the young peo ple he was seeing . Another small group formed about him at the base of the Memorial . A row of young girls ranging from twenty-one to twenty-four and a couple from Syra cuse University were approached by him . He asked each one where she was from , and to one of the girls , when she said she was twenty-four , the President said , ' That 's Tricia 's age . ' He said this with a smile and she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at him . When one of them answered that she was from Syracuse University , the President responded that he had been there once . He talked briefly about the Syracuse football team . " The photographer with the red beard " seemed to be quite delight  --  ed , " the President noted later . " It was , in fact , the broadest smile that I saw on the entire visit . " Hoping he would pass the word along , the Pres  --  ident reprised his main theme . " I know you came a long way for this event . I know you are terribly frus  --  trated and angry about our policy and opposed to it . But I just hope your opposition does n't turn into a blind hatred of the country . This is a great country , with all of its faults , and if you have any doubt about it , go down to the passport office . You wo n't see many people lining up to get out of the country-but abroad , you will see a number lining up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at 7:30 a.m. - the foray had been about three hours-and was still keyed up . Ron Ziegler had be  --  gun to brief the first of the reporters to arrive , Garret Horner of the Wash  --  ington Star , but the President came into the press secretary 's office to tell Horner about the night 's activi  --  ties himself . " I said to them , ' Sure , you came here to demonstrate and shout your slogans on the Ellipse . That 's all right . Just keep it peaceful . Remember , ' I said , ' I feel just as deeply about this as you do . ' " When Horner asked if he planned to have student leaders come into the White House , he replied , " The one thing I do n't want is to bring them in here and exploit them . I think this has been far more useful . There were no TV cameras , no press . They did not feel the awesome power of the White House . I was trying to relate to them in a way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Of course , reporters went out looking for students who had been there . The one most frequently quoted was a Syracuse University sophomore , one of the girls the Pres  --  ident had talked to briefly on his way to the car : " I hope it was be  --  cause he was tired , " the girl was quoted as saying , " but most of what he was saying was absurd . Here we had come from a university that 's completely uptight-on strike - and when we told him where we were from , he talked about the football team . " The girl was being truthful enough-she had not been at the ex  --  tended talk inside the Memorial , and she felt the few words she had heard were patronizing . The reporters were not deliberately slanting the reaction story - she happened to be the one they found who was around the scene , and all the others had scat  --  tered . But the result-especially after these reactions were reported on the evening television news programs - was that the President , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " bums , " had com  --  pounded his error by talking conde  --  scendingly about trivial matters like football or visiting foreign cities with students who had come in serious  --  ness to protest about the war . From a public relations point of view , then , the visit to the Lincoln Memorial was a flop , Had the visit been planned with public relations in mind , it would have been a success . As the President pointed out to Haldeman later , he could have made sure some cameras were there , and engaged in a spirited dialogue with the students about why we were in Cambodia , why we had not ended the war sooner , the morality of the war , a subject and a format that would have had him at a distinct ad vantage and one that certainly would have made more news . But he had not preplanned the visit . He had the impulse to get out and mingle with some young people who were frightened and worried about their country . When he got to them , most of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with , and it occurred to him that this was probably the only time any of them would talk to a President of the United States . They could see him on television as often as they liked discussing the subjects that brought them to Washington , but here was a chance , as he put it , " to try to lift them a bit out of the miserable intellectual wasteland in which they now wander aimlessly around . " So he veered away from making debating points , and instead of using the twenty-five or thirty students there in the Memorial as a device for talking to all students across the United States , he talked only to the students who were there . To a few individuals , he tried to get across something of what a President should mean to people . He did n't have a gimmick . He did not stage a " confrontation " with full coverage and the result never in doubt . He was their President . He was there with them , he did not have horns , he treated them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freedom or their country . His pres  --  ence there was not going to reassure millions of students or influence a single commentator , but there was something to be said for his being there , with a few people , at that moment . It was good for him , good for them , good for the nation . Was there an ulterior motive ? If there had been one , it would have gone this way : ( 1 ) The press pres  --  sure was on for the President to meet with a delegation of the students , to contrast his attitude of concern in 1970 to his attitude of studied indif  --  ference in 1969 , when he pointedly watched television football during the demonstrations . ( 2 ) If he were to meet with students , the only thing the leaders could do to satisfy their constituencies would be to de  --  nounce him to his face and then use the White House press room as a TV forum to tell the nation how they told off the President . ( 3 ) There  --  fore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situation would be to go over the heads of the rally lead  --  ers , go out and see the average pro  --  tester on hallowed ground like the Lincoln Memorial , and be able to avert subsequent confrontations with publicity-hip demonstrators by saying he met the students already . He could even take the high-handed position of not wanting to exploit the young people by putting them on display . Frankly , that makes a good " game plan " - I wish I 'd recommend  --  ed it . But the fact is , nobody did . If that had been in the President 's mind , it would have been given some modicum of planning to ensure proper coverage . And certainly Hal  --  deman would have known about it-there were no secrets from him . No , there is no explaining away Nixon 's night at the Memorial as a devious plot . On the contrary , it was an im petuous act of compassion that ironically-lack of planning made ' appear unconvincing . After the visit was treated by the papers as an example of Nixon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Haldeman if it would not have been better to have centered a televised discussion on what his Ad  --  ministration was doing to meet stu  --  dent concerns on the draft , on the war , on the environment . " I really wonder , in the long run , " Haldeman says the President replied , " if this is all the legacy we want to leave . If it is , then perhaps we should do our jol , as expeditiously as we can , and gel out . If the news gimmicks are all that count , if the big promises are the only thing that means anything any more , then maybe we should leave the responsibilities of the govern ment to the true materialists , the socialists and totalitarians , who talk idealism but rule ruthlessly without any regard to individual considera  --  tions the respect for personality that I tried to emphasize in my dia logue with the students . " All in all , it was one strange night for Richard Nixon . He broke out of the cocoon that separates the Presi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , enjoyed a taste of real life and the bitter aftertaste . He spoke to a small and unrepresen  --  tative sampling of today 's youth , and let his natural impulses carry him along in the aftermath of crisis . In so doing , Nixon deeply in  --  spired a young man who had neve , seen him up close before " Bud-Krogh- who , as head of a special in vestigating unit that called itself " th , plumbers , " followed orders in a way that led him to the break-in of Daniel Ellsberg 's psychiatrist 's office . From his close observation of Nixon on his visit to the Lincoln Memorial , Krogh regarded the President as a compas sionate and profoundly misunder  --  stood man , harboring no ill will to peaceful demonstrators . The thirty  --  year-old aide to John Ehrlichman would then have done practically anything the President asked hini , n
