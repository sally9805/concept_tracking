txt This fall , as the leaves turn color and fall to the ground , Ford Motor Co. will unveil two new cars , the Ford Granada and the Mercury Monarch . But it was last winter , when the trees were covered with icicles and the ground with snow , that the Granada and Monarch names were born . It was n't an easy delivery  --  the naming of new car models rarely is . Thousands of Ford employes had spent countless hours over the span of a year trying to determine if the new cars should be Granada/Monarch , Gemini/Monticello , Eagle/Park Lane , Fairmont/Madera , or Milano/Roma . You should know , first off , that the Granada and the Monarch are basically the same car , both boxy. compact luxury cars . One is the Ford division product , the other a Mercury , as is the case with the Ford Maverick and Mercury Comet , twins with different monikers . Originally , the Granada/Monarch combination was to replace the Maverick/Comet in 1975 , but the sudden appeal in small cars made Ford decide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ models at the top end of the line . " Granada actually was to be called the Maverick , " explained Henry Wolpert , manager of car marketing research for Ford Motor Co. , " but when we first started to show the car in marketing ' studies we got no Maverick response . And once we knew people did n't consider it a Maverick , the question was what to name it . " Using the Granada/Monarch as an example , Wolpert traced the steps taken to give a car an identity , steps fairly common industrywide . " Generally we start with a list of names compiled ' by our ad agency and our car divisions . They come up with a host of names-10 to 20 . " WITH THE Granada , he said , early market studies , revealed consumers associated the car with the German Mercedes , " so we thought about a name with a German sound to it . We fed the ' information into a computer and it spit out , ' Bismarck . ' We gave up that idea . " If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ford 's legal counsel might have , because once the initial list of names is compiled it is sent to the general counsel , said Wolpert . " They weed out those names which might present legal , ethnic , or cultural complications , and names that already may be trademarked . As an example , when the Mustang first came out in 1965 we had to call it the T-5 in Germany because there was a Mustang truck there at the time . " Once the initial names are whittled down , they are turned over to the marketing research staff to start its research . " And then it 's our problem to tet down to two to six candidates , " he said . WOLPERT EXPLAINED that videotapes are made of the car with accompanying narration on both the interior and exterior features . If the name list has been reduced to a choice of four , four tapes are shot , each one identical but using a different name for the car . The name is repeated frequently in the film and is superimposed on the screen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " One of the early choices for the Monarch was ' Madera , ' which sounded fine , but when people saw the name on the screen they associated it with wine  --  and booze and cars do n't mix ; " said Wolpert . Once the films are completed , they are screened for specially selected groups of consumers chosen from selected cities across the United States . Tho Wolpert admits the groups 31'C chosen because " we feel they are the kind of people that would buy the type we are trying to name , " all other specifics are secret . Groups of 10 or 12 are taken to a hotel for the presentation . Each group will see only one of the films so that each is being surveyed on only one of the name choices . These presentations are conducted in four to five cities to get geographic reactions as well . " The people do n't know the immediate reason we bring them there . At first we simply give them a list of words and ask them to associate them with some names . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person to match which word he would associate with the names . One such sheet had Monarch vying with Monticello , a name that nearly made it . " Which of the two , Monarch or Monticello , do you associate with such words as ' slow , young , old , strange , foreign , dead , pleasant ' ? " the respondents were asked . " We get the flavor of the name that way without talking cars , " Wolpert said . " Next we show the tapes . After each group sees a tape we give them a sheet with descriptive phrases on it , and ask them which ones apply or do n't apply to the car . This tests the word 's imagery . " A sample phrase would be " a car that looks well engineered . " " NEAR THE END of our research we throw in a benchmark word for comparison , such as Montego , which Is well known , and see which of the possible name choices comes closest to acceptance to the already established Montego . " With the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Park Lane , and Roma . Montego had the most appeal , Monticello and Monarch were about equal , and Park Lane and Roma had the least . " After this test , respondents are given the names and prices of several cars currently on the road and asked where the new model they just saw in the film fits in . Each sample name is tested to determine what price tag it implies . " Some names have value projection , " Wolper t said . " With Granada/Monarch we wanted a high price range to communicate to the public that this was the U. S. ' answer to the Mercedes . " FINALLY WE asked if they would buy the car . This simply is a test of the appeal of the name because we know we get an overstatement in buying preference at the test . " But the work still is n't over . Next Ford sometimes puts on a private show of its future vehicles along with the current products from the competition . " By now our role is finished and it 's up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ research findings , " Wolpert said . " On the Granada/ Monarch , we were done in December of last year . A car Is approved for production before we ever choose the name . " WOULD THE Edsel have sold any better if it had been called the Mustang ? " That name was never researched like we do it now , " Wolpert asserted . " The first time we did research on it was after it got on the road , yet now we take six months to a year before the car comes out . " Today Ford conducts research programs into product acceptance , package evaluation , product evaluation , product acceptance , secondary product acceptance , acceptance validation , name , merchandising , and advertising ? all before the name is chosen .
