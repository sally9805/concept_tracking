THE TALK OF THE TOWN Notes and Comment FOR several weeks now , we have been pondering the plight of the eight citizens whom the House Internal Security Committee has booted off its list of dangerous radicals without as much as a by-your-leave . The original list , made public last October , consisted of the names of people who had spoken on college campuses while supposedly belonging to or supporting organizations that the committee believed to be part of the Red Menace . ( The committee retains the same peculiarl ? broad view of what constitutes Bolshevism that it had when it was known as the House Un-American Activities Committee . HUAC , like the " front groups " it had warned Americans against for so long , one day simply changed its name without changing its policies  --  making its acronym HISC , which we find mildly onomatopoetic . ) Although the purpose of the list-gathering was ostensibly to discover how the revolution is being financed , civil libertarians asserted that its real purpose was to limit some people 's right ro be heard by intimidating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overthrow of the republic if they engaged those people as speakers . But if the people on the original list were wronged , what about the eight people who were left off a revised list that the committee published in December ? These are days , after all , when film producers in bellbottom trousers put out what they like to think of as revolutionary statements and when hankers give talks on how to stand up to the Establishment . Can there he a campus in the country where inclusion in a House Internal Security- Committee list of dangerous radicals is n't considered a minimum requirement for a political speaker ? It is possible , of course , for some radicals to claim that they were overlooked by the committee : since there were people on the original list whn turned out to have no connection with the organizations mentioned , it is reasonable to assume that there were people not on the list who were connected with the organizations . But someone who was on the original list and then was rejected must be someone who was considered , upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What college organi7ation would want to hire a speaker who is not even radical enough to be included in a list of people considered radical by the House Internal Security Committees When the revised list first came out , it appeared to as that the eight rejectecs had been permanently robbed of their source of income . Lately , though , we have begun to believe that their careers can be salvaged . The eight may , after all , show up on the list of people spied on by the Army . Or , if not the Army , the Air Force . Or it may turn out that their phones are being tapped as part of the Attorney General 's broader wiretapping program . Or they may he included in a list compiled by any one of a number of local police forces that collect photographs and license numbers at anti-war rallies . The eight rejectees must find it comforting to live in a country in which remedies are so readily available . Be fart MAY-RicE Bki ART , the Frencli choreographer whose " Ballet of the Twentieth Century @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Academy of Music , is regarded in Europe as the social revolutionary of classical ballet . Btlart 's convictions- ? that dance is a basic human ritual , that choreographers should emphasize men instead of women , that ballet must he taken nut of nineteentli-century opera houses and presented in twentieth-century sports stadiums if it is to survive in an age of mass communication  --  have demolished artistic conventions and hooked a generation of young people . If his idea of total theatre  --  ballet augmented by speech and song is not universally admired ( critics over thirty rend to he skeptical ) , his audiences are enormous : ten thousand one night in Paris , twelve thousand in Berlin , another twelve thousand in Montreal , twenty-five thousand in Mexico City . We travelled out to Brooklyn to meet M. BOart , who , of course , is playing to much smaller audiences at the Academy , and found him pacing back and forth in the gold-upholstered auditorium with the grace of a caged panther . Onstage , thirty girls , strikingly individual in appearance and personality ( Bejart 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prides himself on its international character ) , were performing classical barn- c xe hattements , and erabesqurs  --  un de r the watchful eye of a longhaired ballet master . M. 136. jart , a compact , ? electric man of forty-three who has light-blue eyes and a black Goyaesque mustache and beard , greeted us with a smile and indicated that he would he happy to talk about the company after a run-through of " Choreographic Offering , " a ballet that he had composed for this tour . " It 's a discourse between the two main elements in my work  --  classical ballet , which is choreographed to Bach 's ' Musical Offering , ' and modern dance , which appears during percussion passages , to interrupt and parody the traditional steps , " he said . " There is a struggle between the two styles , but we do n't resolve it . We end with a young girl holding out a rose to the audience . That 's our way of saying , ' In New York , you have the best choreographers and dancers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ballet . Come to your own conclusions " When the harres were pushed hack and the entire company had assembled onstage , M. Bfjart sat down on a rickety wooden chair in the center aisle , picked up a microphone , and said , " Al-l ? nes enfants ! " Five girls spaced themselves in the center of the stage and began to perform the famous thir ? ty-two fouettis  --  whipping turns on one toe  --  from " Swan Lake . " As the girls dropped out , one by one , a lithe redhead , who , M. Mart told us , was MaMa Gielgud , Sir John 's niece , completed the exercise and added a few extra spins to prove that she had energy to spare . Mart smiled , and waved to a man who was sitting at an electronic console in one of the theatre boxes . As the recorded sounds of Bach 's gravely beautiful theme filled the auditorium , Paolo Bortoluzzi , the company 's principal dancer , performed a few classical steps and then was interrupted by Micha Van Hoecke , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of drums , chimes , and the Iguanaphone , a towering instrument that resembles the backbone of an arthritic dinosaur Groups of dancers dressed in black or white alternated between classical passages of considerable beauty and modern sequences in which torsos twisted and arms and legs became angular weapons . Toward the end of the ballet , M. Mart picked up two metal bars and beat them together in gradually accelerating rhythm as Bortoluzzi circled the stage in a series of soaring leaps . Then , after the entire company had FEBRUARY ( .2 9 7 1 danced a passage combining the two styles ( Bach punctuated by some startling beeps and drumbeats ) , M. Bo:jart dashed onstage to arrange the dancers in a final tableau . When M. Mart returned to the chair , we asked why his concept of ballet was regarded as such a break with the past . " It should n't be , " he said . " As you can see , our fundamental training is purely classical . But we do try to use traditional techniques in ballets of ideas  --  ballets that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be . I am not interested in the fashionable audience that comes to a theatre for two hours of light entertainment . For me , dance is one of the fundamental activities of the human race  --  an art that has not developed completely , because it has been restricted to a small , specialized world . When you go to the cinema , you do n't need special knowledge to judge whether a film is good or not . I take the same approach to ballet . I speak directly with the body and the sense of movement , and hope that the audience participates to the extent of being concerned about what is happening onstage . " M. Mart added that there are two parts to his company 's repertoire . " To Brooklyn we bring intimate theatrical productions that were choreographed for the Thatre Royal de la Monnaii , in Brussels , but we also have large-scale works for sports stadiums  --  the Berlioz ' Romeo and Juliet , ' and Beethoven 's Ninth Symphony , ' which is performed with orchestra , chorus , and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mass audience in person  --  not on film or television  --  because dance is ritual , and ritual needs the living presence . " We asked M. Mart to describe the Academy repertoire , and he replied that it included " Le Sacre du Printemps ; " " Messe pour le Temps Present , " a two-hour episodic work dealing with love , militarism , and alienation in modern life ; " Bliakti , " Hindu love poem ; and " Les Vainqueurs , " a ballet about love and renunciation that is based on the music of " Tristan and Isolde " and on a libretto inspired by the life of Buddha that Richard Wagner was writing at the same time . " The libretto which is also called ' Les Vainqueurs ' ? exists , but nobody has ever discovered a note of the music , " said M. Bejart . " So I made a theory from my own experience as a choreographer . If you work on two ideas simultaneously and produce just one of them , the dominant work absorbs the ideas you prepared for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ music Wagner wrote for ' Les Vainqueurs ' ended up in ' Tristan , ' so I combined the two works . The final words of Isolde , when she says ' I sought to dissolve myself in the ocean of life , ' are very like a well-known Buddhist prayer . " " You have n't mentioned ' The Fire-bird , ' " we said , referring to a recent and startling ballet , also based on Stravinsky , in which M. B6jart has two men dance a role that is traditionally given to a woman . " Mail certa ; nernent , " said M. Wjart , giving us a Mephistophelean smile . " The music is so strong , so modern , so full of life , but the Russian legend on which the original ballet was based  --  the magical Firebird who enables a prince to rescue a princess from a wicked spreerer  --  is impossible to translate on the modern stage . So I thought there must he a way to reach the spirit of the music . The ballet was composed shortly before the Russian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as Esenin and Mayakovsky , I discovered that there was a small group of avant-garde writers , artists , composers , and dancers working in this period who called themselves the Fire-bird . So I did an abstract ballet but tried to give the feeling of young intellectuals grouped around one boy searching for something new in life . The Firebird leader is a phoenix . He is destroyed , but hr rises from the ashes and lives again . That is why we have two men dancing the Firebird instead of one ballerina . " " Are you undermining the concept of the . - na% " we asked . " Possibly , " replied M. Ikjart . " Ballet has been a woman-dominated art since the middle of the nineteenth century , but in ever ) folklore the male dancer is more important . In seventeenth-century France and Italy , where ballet was horn , women at first were not even allowed to participate . For example , Louis XIV was a very good dancer , but never his queen . They called him the Sun King because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ballets . In the classic repertoire , we have the entrcchat , the jump in which a dancer changes the position of his feet several times . The entrechat-trois is always called le royal , because the Sun King performed it exceptionally well . I think the day of the prima donna in dance , theatre , and opera has passed into the history of our civilization . Now we begin to go in the other direction . " ? SIGN observed next to the cashier 's 6 ? -3 cage at the Wollman Memorial Skating Rink , in Central Park : DIME REQUIRED MR USE OF FREE LOCKERS Flag Down IN the light of some of the issues at stake in the recent City Council hearings on taxi-fare increases , a Brooklyn correspondent of ours has reported an ominous experience he had the other night . He was standing en a street corner in Brooklyn trying to hail a taxi to take him to Manhattan , when a yellow , medallioned t i.e. , non-gypsy ) cab came to a stop in front of him for a red light . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flag was down , our correspondent made no effort to hail it , but as it stood there , he became aware that the hack seat was empty . His first reaction , he reports , was one of simple concern , as if he had noticed that a passing motorist 's tire was soft , his muffler pipe sagging , or his license plate loose . " Hey ! " he called to the driver . " You do n't have any passenger ! " The cabby assured our correspondent that it was nothing to worry about . It was not , as our correspondent had feared , that some irate passenger , perhaps caught in a traffic jam , had surreptitiously taken a powder , or even that the driver had inadvertently left the meter running after discharging a fare . Rather , as the cabby calmly explained , it was that he had got fed up with Brooklyn after working half the night there , and was making his way hack to Manhattan at his own expense , instead of employing the more prevalent but illegal ruse of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The driver added that it was a relatively economical tactic , since a dollar and a half , say , on the meter would he divided with the fleet owner and would cost him only about seventy-five cents . It appears that there is no law prohibiting a cabby from driving at his own expense and passing up passengers as long as his flag is down .

" Meet Barry Van Lenten , editor , and Bob Liehler , advertising director of our Boutique Magazine , " said Mr. Davis . " And I 'll go get Alan Larkin , our publisher , who started the whole thing . " He left , and we asked Mr. Van Lenten ( the dark hair ) and Mr. Liebler ( blond ) if they would mind telling us what they Mg , because we thought looked impressive . " Not at all , " Mr. Van Lenten said politely . " Around my neck , on this thin silver chain , this pendant is made of kingfisher feathers overlaid on silver .

" I stopped wearing T-shirts when the mercerized-cotton council tried to foist upon me the idea that I 'd he cooler in the summer wearing a T-shirt . If you like , I 'll start from the bottom up on my clothes . " " Please , " we said . " My hoots are full , high leather boots made by Italia , with a zipper on the side .

" " It goes directly to twenty-five thousand retailers , " said Mr. Van Lenten . " It costs six dollars a year . There was a gap between what the retailers were doing and the communication between them and all the established publications . Luckily , we got there first . " " Why ' boutique ' ? " we asked . " It is the lousiest name , " Mr. Lich. ler said . " It 's the most maligned name . But there 's no Netter word for what 's happening . It 's an attitude . " " It 's like Bendel 's is the department store of the future , " said Mr. Van Lenten . " Bendel 's is now almost all boutiques  --  shops within a shop .

A different type of selling . This show is boutique-oriented ; it 's not a mother-oriented show . There 's an outfit in London , incidentally , actually called Mother Would n't Like It . " " Why do you like being boutique-oriented ? " we asked . " I 'm very fashion-oriented , " said Mr. Liebler . " And , to use a tired phrase , this is where it 's at . " " And like the people , " said Mr. Van Lenten . " If you watch the young people here , you 'll see that they 're very warm , very gentle people .

" Now , here 's a guy , Kaymac , out in Royal Oak , Michigan , who did twenty-five thousand dollars in 1969 with his body fragrances , decals , patches , and heads . Last year , he did one million . This stuff is a body fragrance , a liquid incense , a room deodorizer , all in one . And he makes it in strawberry , lime , patchouli , raspberry " , and cherry besides the tangerine I put on you . Does n't it smell like tan- gerine ? " " Well ... " we began . A tall , lean , gray-haired , gray-mustached , gray-sideburned man wearing horn-rimmed glasses , a conventional Glen-plaid suit , a pink shirt , and a red silk necktie strode nervously into the room . He was followed by Sid Davis . " The man who filled the void  --  Alan B. Larkin ! " Mr. Davis said . " There 's a whole exciting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then he strode out again , hyperactively . " Why is n't Mr. Larkin dressed the way you are ? " we asked . " That 's true . He 's not together , " Mr. Liebler said gently " We 're working on getting him into some thrilling threads . " " You should have seen him last year , " said Mr. Van Lenten . " He did n't even have the mustache . " " But the world loves a doer , and he 's a doer , " said Mr. Liebler . Mr. Larkin returned , restlessly , and sat down . Sartorially , he was still not together . His threads were still unthrilling . " How do you like your show ? " we asked him . " Great ! " he said . " It 's great to see these beautiful young people , beautiful young people who would n't go near business a few years ago , now getting involved in the so-called Establishment . Suddenly , here are these young people , people with a fantastic vibrancy , and they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , beautiful people for years could not find what they wanted in the stores , and now , through their handicrafts , they have created their own . " " What made you come up with the idea for the show ? " we asked . " I 've been running shows for the ? apparel industry for twenty-five years , Boston-based , " Mr. Larkin said . " Apparel shows emanate from sales shows . Every major market has a sales show . For the past decade , for forty weeks out of every year , I 've been putting on thirty-two regional shows . I have a feeling about how to run a show . I ran trade shows for the discount houses  --  an industry that has gone from five and a half billion dollars in e 1962 to twenty-three billion in 1969 , according to Dun &; Bradstreet . A show shows cohesively in one place what 's going on , and those not in the show get pretty nervous about being out . There have been only three revolutions in the twentieth century . One , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , fashion . The boutique is part of the third revolution , and this is only the beginning . "
