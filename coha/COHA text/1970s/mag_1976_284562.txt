Saul Bellow loves the game . Elvis Presley has his own court . The football teams at Notre Dame and Michigan State practice it as part of their training programs . Illinois Governor-elect James Thompson and Wayne Rogers have learned it and , at a California club partially owned by OJ . Simpson , so have many others . In fact , nearly 3 million people have taken up racquetball-an indoor racquet game played on handball courts-in the past six years , making it the new boom sport of the tennis-conscious ' 70s . To accommodate it , new courts are rising as quickly-and conspicuously-as the welts caused by the hollow , rubber racquetball . <P> In 1970 , only 50,000 souls played the game , braving the clan-ridden handball courts of big-city gyms with their truncated tennis racquets . It was tough going ; prying loose playing time on a handball court made getting in to the Royal Enclosure at Ascot seem relatively simple . Still , racquetball aficionados persisted , hooked on the sport 's caroming speed . <P> Whooshing Sphere . Racquetball was invented by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he substituted a sawed-off tennis racquet for the wooden paddleball racquet and put strings in the handball-derived game . Played on a four-wall court 20 ft. wide , 40 ft. long and 20 ft. high , the 2-in. ball must be returned to the front wall before it bounces twice . Floor , ceiling* and walls are fair play for the whooshing sphere ; the ultimate shot-the handball-style " kill " - is a ball aimed at the right angle of front wall and floor , a shot that virtually rolls away . <P> In the crowded confines of the racquetball court , beginners need not chase errant shots as tennis players must , and singles , not doubles matches are the rule . The ball comes zinging back like a small cannon ball , and an opponent 's 18-in. stringed racquet can be a hazard , often inflicting racquetball 's most distinctive mark-waffle-face . It is hell in a very small place . <P> Despite injuries , racquetball is an excellent fitness game . The speed of the sport produces maximum exercise in minimum time ; tennis players report a more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours of tennis . So when commercial developers built the first racquetball clubs in suburban Chicago and Minneapolis four years ago , tennis players came streaming in from the cold . Today there are 510 court clubs-as distinguished from the old handball haunts-and more are under construction , mostly in the Midwest and the West ; high real estate costs have limited development in the East . <P> Fully a third of the new players are women . Strategy and " court sense " - the subtleties of caroms and positioning - can serve to neutralize male advantages in strength . One Chicago woman , however , reports a feminine disadvantage : " Women are more reluctant to push and shove the other player than men , and that sort of aggressiveness is necessary in this game . " Age does not seem to be a factor . The top woman player in the country is 40-year-old Peggy Steding , a professional racquetballer from Odessa , Texas . She has won every major title in the past four years , routinely whipping opponents young enough to be her daughters .    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
