They noted that he had served from 1969 until last month on the President 's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board . Rockefeller denied any conflict of interest . <P> Indeed , it was certainly premature , if not unfair , to fault the commission before its members had reported their findings and recommendations to Ford by his deadline of April 4 .

GRISWOLD , 70 , a former dean of Harvard Law School ( 1946-67 ) currently practicing law in Washington . As U.S. Solicitor General , a post @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Government 's unsuccessful Supreme Court case against publication of the Pentagon papers . He also argued before the Supreme Court that the Army 's surveillance of civilians from 1967 to 1970 was legal , though " inappropriate .
