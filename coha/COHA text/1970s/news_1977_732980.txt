txt Letters Letters - Of Deficit Thinking and ' a Flimsy Statistic ' To the Editor : Your Feb. 26 editorial " Deficit Thinking " had a concluding statement which struck an odd note . I was surprised that the writer should , at this late date , still regard the Alleged Unemployment/ Claimed Membership in the Civilian Labor Force ratio as having much statistical reliability . He summed up his hopes for a larger Federal budgetary deficit , presumably conducive to more inflation , by contending that without it we might experience " unemployment well above 7 percent . And that is too much to pay . " If the 7 percent was to be his point of reference , I do not see how anyone could debate the whole question with him because the 7 percent is a flimsy statistic , based on inadequate facts and on subjective evaluations . The denominator of the fraction may include people who ( 1 ) are not really looking for a job and ( 2 ) may be unemployable for mental , physical , moral or attitudinal reasons . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who actually believe that they are employable but whose job records do not reveal evidence of energy , willingness or trustworthiness . In short , the ratio which purports to To the Editor : In his March 2 letter , Senator John Heinz of Pennsylvania defends his Public Works Bill amendment with a combination of practical and implied theoretical argument . Under this amendment , no extra funds would go to states with extra high unemployment . New York and New Jersey would lose almost a quarter of the construction money we would otherwise get ; Connecticut more than half . As a measure of the sums involved , this would come to $113.7 million for New York alone . Senator Heinz sees this as a practical first step to long-range reform . The 16 " Snowbelt " states , he writes , " have long been the victims of a system that unfairly distributes Federal funds to various parts of the country . " He suggests that by forgoing this momentary advantage , we will be the long-term beneficiaries , presumably in the aftermath of a general disavowal of such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an especially practical plan . But none , I dare to think , will fail to see that at bottom what we have here is a revival of the 19th-century struggle over the principle of graduated taxation and the corollary principle of helping most those who most need help . It is an all but forgotten battle , but it raged for a generation and ended ( or was thought to have ended ! ) only with the adoption of the 16th Amendment , which gave Congress power to levy an income tax " without apportionment among the several states , and describe the rate of involuntary unemployment of employables really describes something entirely different , i.e. , the voluntary and involuntary unemployment of people who may or may not be employable . There is in wide use today a solid , factual ratio , and I am sure that your writer is familiar with it . It is Actual Employment/Working-Age Population . If he had stated , therefore , that without the larger Federal budgetary deficit we might experience " employment gains at a rate substantially slower than in recent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The point of reference would have been meaningful . Use of this strong statistic , though , would have put the writer at an initial debating disadvantage , which I am sure he recognized . The " actual employment " ratio proves that the remarkable American economic machine is doing a good job of providing employment in line with the growing population . As shown in the historical sweep of the ratio , employment is considerably higher than the average of the last 30 years and is even above the figure of the great boom year , 1972 . As an absolute figure , employment is , of course , at an ail-time high . without regard to any census or enumeration . " Senators Penrose and Oliver , sound Pennsylvania Republicans , voted for the 16th Amendment in 1909 , but evidently the issue persists among our gentle neighbors to the south . The principle of redistributive justice was sound in 1909 and is sound today . Those most in need ought to get more . But leave aside principle for the moment . After two generations in which the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regions of the nation . ought we to abandon the practice at just that moment when it begins to work in our favor ? During the recent campaign , President Carter said : " Today , America 's number one economic problem is our cities , and I want to work with you to meet the problems of urban America just as Franklin Roosevelt worked to meet the problems of the rural South in the 1930 's . " Secretary of Commerce Juanita Kreps , and the Administration , arc strongly backing the bill reported by the Senate Committee on Environment , and Public Works which rejects the Heinz amendment and retains the principle of " targeting . " Unfortunately , in the interim the House , by 14 votes , has adopted the Heinz amendment , The full Senate will act this week . DANIEL PATRICK MOYNIHAN U.S. Senator from New York Washington , March 7 , 1977 Those who have ideological fixes on the old method could patch it up and make it a fairly good one . All that would need to be done would be to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sample , question the respondents extensively and much more bluntly for detailed facts , and follow up with very thorough checks for misinformation and lack of veracity . It would cost a few hundred million dollars annually to do it this way , but the benefits in the shaping of national policy would be inestimable . The gross deception practiced by partisan groups on the American public might be slowed down . The end result would be a general realization that a massive , expensive , long-term program of " personal rehabilitation and training " would ' be vastly more appropriate in solving the problem than to continue with stopand-start , inflation-inducing spurts of Federal budget deficits and money creation . These are , in most cases , dangerous and unnecessary . JAMES L. KNIPE Sea Girt , N.J. , Feb. 28 , 1977 The writer is former consultant to the chairman of the Federal Reserve System 's Board of Governors . Smoking in Hospitals : The City 's Prohibition To the Editor : The article ( Feb. 28 ) about the failure of hospitals to curb smoking quotes spokesmen from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York City as saying John Cold ail hat bedridden patients are permitted to smoke in their rooms . It should be brought to the attention of the administrators of these hospitals that they are in violation of the New York City Fire Department laws , which expressly prohibit smoking in any patient rooms or corridors in a hospital , nursing home or convalescent home in New York City . Fire Prevention Directive 5-65 further states that a hospital may lose its authorization for designated smoking areas " for any infraction of these rules , or the failure to cooperate in confining smokers to smoking locations . " SHEILA STEMBER President , Greater New York Council Against Public Smoking New York , Feb. 28 , 1977 Public Works Bill : ' Those Most in Need ' Martha 's Vineyard Will Become a Dukedom ' Coffee : ' What Right Have We to Complain ? ' To the Editor : How , in a country which readily sells sophisticated armaments to countries which do not need them and can not readily maintain them ; which " transfers technology " to developing nations lacking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Eskimos is something to be proud of , can citizens complain when a nation it has helped learns its lessons ? Specifically , what right have we to complain about Brazil and coffee prices when at worst it is merely another example of " charging all the traffic will bear , " a business practice this nation has not hesitated to use , often with nations far less able than we to bear the costs ? A little less coffee may lead to a a little less hypocrisy . MICHAEL MIERNIK New York , March 2 , 1977 In Lieu of ' Minimize ' To the Editor : As a confirmed English-language reactionary , I have long protested against the insurgence of the incorrectly used " hopefully , " the overused " viable " and the ever-present postWatergate gibberish . Your recent article " So What 's the Bad Word ? " interested me greatly . One item , however , particularly caught my attention : Winthrop Sergeant , in " downgrading " the word " downplay , " offered a number of possible synonyms , among them the word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the lexicographers have n't mentioned much , and even the - ize- ophobes have let this one go . The word most people should be using instead of " minimize " is " minify . " A quick look in Webster 's ( 2d edition , of course ) shows the difference : To minimize is to reduce to the smallest part possible or to estimate at a minimum ; to minify is to make smaller or lessen . " Minify , " at least in the sense most people use , is the right word . Oddly enough , in his hook " Witch 's Milk . " Peter De Vries has his protagonist point out the difference between these two words . Houghton Mifflin , you 've got at least one good man on your panel ! DAVID GALEF Scarsdale , N.Y. , Feb. 24 , 1977 To the Editor : Martha 's Vineyard has been in the news recently over the loss of its representation in the Massachusetts Legislature . Perhaps you have read that Martha 's Vineyard might secede from the State of Massachusetts and maybe even from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been considerable talk about the governor and representatives of the new entity , I wanted to bring the real underlying thinking on the island to your attention . Martha 's Vineyard will become a dukedom  --  an independent nation . The duke has already been chosen . You 're laughing already  --  but wait ! Have you considered how fantastically attractive it is ? First of all , our future duke is very rich and will not he paid : so our overhead will be low . Second , we will be rid of U.S. Government ( and state government ) interference in our internal affairs . Third , we will then have amazing money-making potential ( something we do not have at the present time ) . Some of these income-producing opportunities are : the sale of stamps ; the sale of coins of the realm , and a tax-free status allowing us to attract banking business . Tourist revenue will also rise through tax-free shopping opportunities  --  not to mention a head tax . You have yet to hear about the ministries that will be required under the duke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) as they have not yet been finalized ; hut , fisheries , aviation , shipping , education , trade and tourism are immediately obvious . The change to dukes will be unannounced to the world until it happens . The duke of Dukes ' first official act will be to preclude immigration through a law which can not be divulged . Too many people will want to live in Dukes with our almost nonexistent taxes and our superb four-season climate only four miles from the United States . THOMAS M. CHILTON Vineyard Haven , Mass. , Feb. 25 , 1977 For a Madison Mall To the Editor : Five years ago The Times published my article on transforming Madison Avenue into a shopping mall . Since then the mall concept has been defeated by the Board of Estimate by a vote of 12 to 10 , but lesser visions of malls on Broadway and Fulton Street in Brooklyn have gained ground . At the same time . Madison Aveue has lost ground as a shopping street . The free access of autos on Madison Avenue has not kept stores from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Argentina and Brazil . In Buenos Aires , Sail ' Paulo and Rosario , shopping malls , blocks long , have saved the downtowns . Business and government there had the courage we lacked . Is n't it time for us to dream of Madison Mall again ? ROBERT N. RICKLES Executive Director Institute for Public Transportation New York , Feb. 28 , 1977
