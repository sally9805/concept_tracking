THE PRESIDENCY <P> Jean Baptiste Delisle may be the most skillful politician in Washington . Every noon he brings together the folks who count in the fractured capital and he sends them away a little mellower . Paul , as he is known to the cognoscenti , is the maitre d ' of the Sans Souci , the restaurant that has become a national institution . <P> Sans Souci may be the most significant extracurricular power arena in the Western Hemisphere , perhaps the world . It is the only place where the people who run things still see each other and behave in a civilized way . And eat well , too . <P> A couple of Fridays ago Pierre Salinger , John Kennedy 's press secretary , penned a note between bites of his shrimps sauts nantua and sent it over to Pat Buchanan , President Nixon 's speechwriter , who was deep into an omelette au parmesan . Salinger congratulated Buchanan for his performance before the Watergate committee . On his way out of the restaurant , Buchanan stopped for a cheery chat with Salinger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , George McGovern 's sometime campaign aide . <P> At another table on that day , Jeb Magruder dined on scampi and still looked a little selfconscious . But Paul is nursing this early Watergate casualty back to full participation . When Magruder called to see if he could still get a reservation , Paul said , " Of course , Mr. Magruder , you still belong to Sans Souci . " <P> Indeed , Buchwald , who is more or less the presiding elder , claims that before long it will be just like Harvard . A father will have to enroll his son at birth to be accepted at Sans Souci . <P> Most of the 32 tables are committed for as long as the republic lasts . At every lunch Paul can expect Republicans , Democrats , rights , lefts , ins and apparently outs . Sometimes , to keep them all separated but still within view of each other , he will have to change a person 's table 15 times before he or she arrives . The touchiest situation now is between the Nixon and Agnew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vic Gold , Agnew 's former press secretary and current White House nemesis , a respectable distance from Ken Clawson , a Nixon aide . <P> The other night Paul got a call from a man . " I am General Haig the President 's White House staff chief , " the voice said . " I would like a table for four and send the bill to the White House . " Paul knows his people and their voices , and that is not the way things are done . He politely informed the impostor that he had no tables left , and the incident was quietly buried in Paul 's memory , a rich lode of human behavior at the epicenter . Paul says , " I do n't hear anything , I do n't see anything , I do n't say anything . " <P> He does break a Sans Souci rule now and then , however . The restaurant does not send meals out . But on a lonely Saturday afternoon a plaintive request from Henry Kissinger for his favorite luncheon steak was instantly honored . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agent who had been dispatched for the pickup . The nation went on .
