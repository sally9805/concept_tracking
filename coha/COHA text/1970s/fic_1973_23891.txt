Notes From a Lady at a Dinner Party DUILIP ADLER , passing through the City in r November , had called his old professor of architecture , Clem Harris , and was at once invited to dinner that night at his house in Hempstead to meet some friends and his young wife Karla . She spoke of her husband 's respect for A filer . " He says about you something he rarely says about his former students ? that you deserve your success . Did n't you get an AIA national medal about two years out of graduate school ? " " Not a medal , " Adler said . " It was an Honor Award certificate for a house I designed . " Adler , at the time of the dinner party , was a heavy-bodied man who dressed conservatively and weighed two ten . " That 's what I mean . " She laughed in embarrassment , and he wondered why until it occurred to him she often laughed in embarrassment . She was strong-bodied and plain in an elegant way and wore her brownish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was twenty-four or twenty-five . She had on a short green dress with sandals , and her sturdy legs and thighs were well-formed . Adler , when she asked , said he was thirty-one , and Karla remarked that was a fine age for a man . He puzzled over that because her husband 's age was twice his . She was direct and witty , with a certain serious tensity of expression . It was during dinner that Karla Harris let Adler know about the note in his pocket . They were six at the table in the large dining room with a bay window containing a pebbled bed of chrysanthemums and pink begonias : the hosts ; a middle-age couple , the Ralph Lewinshe a colleague of Harris 's at the Columbia University School of Architecture ; and , perhaps to balance off Adler , Harris 's secretary , Shirley Fisher , had been invited , a thin-ankled , long-skirted , wet-eyed divorc  --  e , who talked and drank liberally . Harris , pouring red wine liberally , presided at the head of the long , neat table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see that everything went as it should ; from time to time her husband smiled his encouragement . Adler sat at her right , facing Lewin across the table , and on his right was Mrs. Lewin , a small , luminous-faced , listening person . Karla , when Harris was ladling the soup into bowls out of a handsome tureen , and the conversation was lively , whispered to Adler , " If you do n't mind surprises , feel in your left pocket when you can , " and though he was n't sure at once was the proper time , when she left the dining room to get the rolls that had almost burned , he casually reached into his suit-coat pocket and felt a folded slip of paper , which after a minute , lie smoothed out and was able to read . If anyone at the table had noticed that Adler 's head was momentarily lowered as though he were privately saying grace , or maybe studying his wristwatch with a view to catching a train back to the City , the architect would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ note , had initiated nothing . The slip of pink lined paper , in small printed handwriting , said simply , " Why do we think we should be happy ? " and for a while Adler , who took questions of this sort seriously , did n't know what to reply . She could easily have asked her question while they were having cocktails on the enclosed porch and he would have done his best with it ; but she seemed concerned about the dinner and had been in and out of the kitchen many times ; dealing also with a girl sitter who was putting the children to bed , really too busy to sustain a conversation with any of her guests . Since she had n't orally asked the question , Adler felt he had to respect the fact that she had found it necessary to write it out on paper and slip into his pocket . If this was the way she was moved to express herself , he thought he ought to reply with a note . He glanced at Harris , aged but still vigorous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the moment concerned with Shirley , listening to her attentively . Adler excused himself  --  he said to get his glasses in his coat pocket  --  to scribble a note on a memo pad ; and when he returned , though he was not comfortable in pretense , he covertly passed the paper to her , grazing her warm hare thigh . though he had n't intended to , then feeling her narrow fingers , as he touched them , close on the note . He had been tempted to say that happiness was nothing lie worried about anymore  --  you had it or you had n't and why beat your brains blue ; but he did n't say that . He had quickly written , " Why not ? ? it 's a short , hard life if you ca n't outfox it . " Karla glanced down at the paper in her hand , a fork in a piece of fish in the other , apparently not disappointed , her color heightened , expression neutral . She disappeared into the kitchen with an empty salad bowl , and when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Adler another note . " I want you to see my babies . " Adler , as he studied this , solemnly nodded , pocketing the paper . When he glanced up she smiled vaguely as her husband , who had once more risen to refill the wine glasses , gazed at her fondly . The others were momentarily quiet but not , apparently , attentive . Karla returned a resemblance of her husband 's smile , as Adler , wondering why she had engaged him in this curious game , felt they were now related in a way he could not have foreseen when he had entered the house that evening . When Harris , behind him . pouring wine into his glass , let his hand fall affectionately on his former student 's shoulder , Adler , who had felt a strong emotion on seeing his old professor after so many years , felt himself resist his touch . , L ATER HE ENJOYED TALKING with him over brandy in the living room ; it was a spacious room , about twenty-four by thirty , tastefully and comfortably furnished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the fireplace mantel and some bright modernist paintings on the walls . Karla was then in the kitchen , showing the sitter how to stack and operate the dishwasher , and Adler felt geared to anticipation , though not sure of what . He tried to suppress the feeling . As Clem Harris poured him a cognac he stealthily felt in his pocket , but there were the two notes only . The professor , a crisp , tall man with a clipped grayish beard , faintly red , and thick gray sideburns , who wore a bright green blazer with an orange shirt and white bow tie , was lavish in his praise of Adler 's latest work , some slides of which the architect had recently sent him ; and Adler once more expressed gratitude for the interest Harris continued to take in him . He had always been a kind man and influential teacher . " What are you into now ? " Harris asked . After two brandies he had gone back to Scotch and soda . His large face was flushed and he wiped his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often he glanced up at the dining-room door in anticipation of his wife 's appearance , " Nothing in particular , " Adler answered after thinking about it . " The same project you saw in the transparencies . What are you doing ? " " Renovating some slum units for a private low-income housing group . There 's not much money in it . It 's more or less pro bona . " " I ought to be doing more of that sort of thing myself . " Harris , after observing his former student for a minute , asked , " Are n't you putting on more weight ? " " I eat too much , " Adler confessed . " You ought to watch your weight . Do you still smoke like a chimney ? " " Not anymore . " " Bully . I wish I could get Karla to cut down . " He seemed concerned . When she reappeared , his wife had brushed and combed her hair . The green dress she had been wearing she had changed for a short , crocheted strawberry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the weave . The warm color of the dress brought out a bloom in her face . She was an attractive woman . " Ah , you 've changed your dress , " her husband said . " I spilled at least a pint of gravy on it , " Karla explained with an embarrassed laugh . She lowered the shades , switched out the lights , quietly closed the door . " I want you to see my study . " It was a light-curtained lavender room with a desk , portable sewing machine , and a circle of snapshots on the wall before her . Her father , who had sold insurance in Columbus , Ohio , was dead . The mother had posed in her flower garden . A shot of Karla taken in college showed a sober-faced thin girl with wire-framed glasses , dark eyes and brows , firm lips . Her desk was cluttered with books , sheet music , shopping lists , correspondence . She wanted to know if Adler had any children . " No . " He told her he had been married @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remarried ? " " N o . " " Clem married me when I was very young , " Karla said . " Did n't you marry him ? " " I mean I hardly knew what I was doing . " " What was he doing ? " " Marrying me when I was very young . " She raised the shade and stared into the night . The windows were wet . " I always give dinner parties on rainy nights . " She said they ought to go down but then opened the closet door and got out a large glossy photograph of a one-family dwelling project she had done in her architecture class with Harris . Adler said it showed promise . Karla smiled wryly . " Really , " he said . " I love your work , " she said . " I love the chances you take . " " If they work out . " " They do , they do . " She seemed to be trembling . They embraced forcefully . She dug her body into his . They kissed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We 'd better go down . " " He 's still on the phone , " Adler said , aroused . " No , we 'd better go down . " " What 's Shirley to him ? " " A tight-jawed hitch . " " To him I said . " " He 's sorry for her . Her fourteen-year-old kid is on LSD . He 's sorry for everybody . " T ITET KISSED AGAIN , then Karla stepped out of his embrace and they went downstairs . Harris was off the phone . " I showed him our babies , " Karla said to her husband . " Show-off , " smiled Harris . " Lovely children , " said Adler . Shirley winked at him . I 've lost the right to his friendship , the architect thought . Then he thought , Things change , they have to . " Now please stay put for a few minutes , " Harris said to Karla . " Catch your breath . " " First I have to pay Stephanie . " Harris went to his den @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ renovation project for a slum housing improvement group : before and after . Adler , his mind on Karla , examined the slides , holding each to the light . He said it was work well done . Harris said he was gratified that Adler approved . Karla was paying Stephanie in the kitchen . Ralph Lewin , smoking a cigar , also looked at the slides although he said he was the one who had originally taken them . Ada and Shirley were on the green sofa on the right side of the room , Ada listening as Shirley went on about her son on LSD . Karla carried in a silver tray ful of bone china cups and saucers . " I 'm always late with coffee , " she remarked . " Make mine tea , " said Ralph . She said she would get the tea in a minute . As she handed out coffee cups she gave Adler a note with his . He read it in the bathroom . " Pretend you 're going to the bathroom , then go Ieft in the back hall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He went to the left in the hall and came out in the kitchen . They kissed with passion . " Where can we meet ? " " When ? " Adler asked . " Tonight , maybe ? I 'm not sure . " " Is there a motel around ? " " Two blocks away . " " I 'll get a room if you can make it . If not tonight , I could stay on till tomorrow noon . I 've got to be in Boston by evening . " " I think I can . Clem and I are in separate bedrooms right now . He sleeps like a dead man . I 'll let you know before you leave . " " Just give me a sign , " Adler said . " Do n't write any notes . " " Do n't you like them ? " Karla asked . " I do but they 're risky . What if he sees you pass me one ? " " It might do him good . " " I do n't want any part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ write notes , " Karla said . " I like to write to people I like . I like to write things that suddenly occur to me . My diary was full of exciting thoughts when I was young . " " All I 'm saying is it could be dangerous . Just . give me a sign or say yes before I leave and I 'll wait there till you come . " " I burned my diary last summer but I still write notes , " Karla said . " I 've always written notes to people . You must let me be who I am . " He asked her why she had burned her diary . " I had to . It beat me up badly . " She burst into tears . DLER LEFT TILE KITCHEN and returned to LHl the bathroom . He flushed the toilet , washed his hands , and reappeared in the living room . At the same moment , Karla , her face composed , brought in Ralph 's tea . For a while they talked politics across the room . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new recording he had bought of Mahler 's " Songs of a Wayfarer . " Despite the singing , Shirley talked earnestly to Ralph Lewin , who suppressed a yawn now and then . Ada and Karla were chatting about the Lewins ' new house , and Harris and Adler , on the long beige couch , discussed developments in architecture . " I might as well turn off the music , " Harris said . After he had put the record away he returned and , resuming their conversation , characterized Adler 's latest work as more daring than ever . " That 's a quality you inspired me to . " " In moderation . " Adler said he appreciated his mentor 's sentiments . He felt for the first time he did not know what to say to him and it made him uncomfortable . Ile was now not sure whether to urge Karla to try to get out of the house tonight . On the one hand , he had gratitude and loyalty to Harris to contend with ; on the other , he felt half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the fireplace , where , to his strange surprise , she whispered , " Something 's coming , " and surreptitiously touched his hand with a folded slip of paper . Turning away from the company , Adler managed to read it , then thrust it into his pocket . Karla 's note said : " Can someone love someone she does n't know ? " " We do it all the time . " " Partly I think I love you because I love your work . " " Do n't confuse me with my work , " Adler said . " It would be a mistake . " " It 's on for tonight , " she whispered . As they stood , side by side , with their backs to the fireplace they reached behind them and squeezed hands . K ARLA , GLANCING ACROSS the room at her husband , excused herself to go up to see if the babies were covered . Adler , for a minute after she had gone , tried to think of a reason to follow her upstairs , but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt nervously expectant . When Karla came down from the nursery he heard her say to her husband . " Clem , I 'm having some anxiety . " " Take a pill , " Harris advised . Adler then seriously wondered whether to tell her to cool it for tonight . It might be better to call her from the motel in the morning , and if she felt she could , they would meet then . But he doubted , if they did not get together tonight , that she would be able to make it in the morning . So he decided to urge her to come as soon as she was sure Harris was asleep . Wanting to tell her the anxiety would go once they were in bed together , he sat down beside her on the green sofa where she was listening distantly to Shirley saying the drugs situation had made her frantic . He waited impatiently for one or the other to get up so that he could say what he had to to Karla . Harris , standing nearby , conversing with Ada @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Karla pretended to be unaware of Adler by her side ; but after a minute he felt her hand groping for his pocket . Without wanting to he moved away . Adler , at that moment , expected his pocket to burst into flame . She 'll write them forever , he thought ; that 's her nature . If not to me , then to the next man who comes into the house who 's done something she wishes she had . He made up his mind to return this note unread . At the same time Adler realized he could n't read it if he wanted to because the paper had n't gone into his pocket but had fallen to the floor . The sight of the folded pink paper at his feet sickened the architect . Karla was staring at it as though reliving a dream , She had written it in her study and it said , " Darling , I ca n't meet you , I 'm six months ' pregnant . " Before either of them could move to retrieve the paper , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had plucked it up . " Did you drop this ? " she asked Clem Harris . Adler 's head was thick with blood . He felt childlike and foolish . I 'm disgraced and deserve it . But Harris did not unfold the paper . He handed it to his former student . " It is n't mine , is it yours ? " " An address I wrote down , " Adler said . He rose . " I have this early train to Boston to catch in the morning . " Ada and Ralph Lewin were the first to say goodnight . " Bon voyage , " said Shirley . Harris brought Adler 's coat and helped him on with it . They shook hands cordially . " The air shuttle is the fastest way to Boston . " Adler said he thought that was how he would go . He then said goodbye to Karla . " Thanks for having me . " " Love , marriage , happiness , " she sang , standing in her crocheted short mini , on the stairs . She runs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
