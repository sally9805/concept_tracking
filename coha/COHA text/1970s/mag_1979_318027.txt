Beyond the issue of securing the release of the hostages in Iran , the biggest immediate problem facing the Carter Administration is how to manage the symbolism of the siege-and , perhaps more important , the symbolism of its aftermath . There is great danger that the spectacle of youthful radicals , backed by an aged and atavistic theocrat , humiliating and terrorizing American diplomatic personnel will have become a symbol of U.S. weakness . On the battlefield of domestic politics , the past two weeks offer Jimmy Carter 's bi-partisan legion of opponents an almost irresistible target for sniping . All a skillful stump speaker has to do is lament " the decline of American power and prestige , " and his listeners will grit their teeth at the memory of Uncle Sam , a goat 's skull for a head , burning in effigy in Tehran while the perpetrators , in a dramatic gesture of their discipline and outrageousness , collect trash in Old Glory . <P> In the international community , the reaction is likely to be more diffuse , but not less damaging to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ countries and Japan , ought to be aghast at an incident that so vividly demonstrates the limits of their senior partner 's power . Friendly states in the Middle East , like Israel , Egypt and Saudi Arabia , will probably be more ambivalent : on the one hand , they may hope that the outrage will provoke the U.S. into playing a more assertive role in their region ; on the other , they are sure to worry about how credible the U.S. performance will be . Said one prominent Saudi : " America has gotten a reputation for letting down its friends , and that wo n't be so easy to correct . " <P> As for U.S. adversaries , particularly the Soviet Union , the events in Iran come as almost unmitigated good news , at least in the short run . The Kremlin is eager for the world , particularly the Third World , to believe that America is on the defensive , if not on the retreat . At the same time , the Soviet leadership is anxious to avoid the impression that the U.S.S.R. is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of dtente , which enjoins the superpowers from " efforts to obtain unilateral advantage , " and it would jeopardize SALT II as well . Therefore , the Soviets prefer that the U.S. seem to be in a losing struggle not so much with a predatory Soviet Union as with the relentless " progressive " ( i.e. , anti-American ) forces of history . In that sense Ayatullah Khomeini , his mobs and his minions are doing the Kremlin 's work , even though they are not doing its bidding . <P> The Soviets concede privately that , in the longer term , the turmoil in Iran has potentially worrisome consequences for the U.S.S.R. Islamic fundamentalism is anathema to Communism , and the Ayatullah is religiously akin to the Muslims of Soviet Central Asia just across the border . On the other hand , the National Security Council last week pondered the possibility that anarchy in Iran could lead to a radical leftist takeover . No doubt the same possibility has occurred to Iran watchers in Moscow . That helps explain the ambiguity of Soviet behavior so far : provocative Farsi-language @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with begrudging diplomatic support for the U.S. at the United Nations .
