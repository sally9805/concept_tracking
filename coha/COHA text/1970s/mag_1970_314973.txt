One of the 20th century 's more resilient mysteries is the disappearance of Flyer Amelia Earhart in 1937 in the South Pacific near the end of a round-the-world flight . Almost the only claim not made by theorists over the years was that she was alive , well and living in New Jersey . <P> That omission was rectified last week with the publication of Amelia Earhart Lives ( McGraw-Hill ; $7.95 ) . In the book , Novelist Joe Klaas traces the ten-year pursuit of an ide fixe by Joseph Gervais , a former Air Force major . Amelia , they say , was really on a spy mission for President Roosevelt , was interned in Japan during the war and traded back to the U.S. in 1945 , where she has lived under an alias ever since . Their argument rests on a slithering foundation of fanciful codes , anagrams , leading but unanswered questions , and hints at deals among the Japanese , Roosevelt and an American industrialist . <P> The woman they name as Amelia is Mrs. Guy Bolam , widow of a businessman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long enough last week to ridicule the book as a " poorly documented hoax . " Hoax or not , the people 's appetite for myth and mystery seems insatiable . Before her press conference was over , the woman from New Jersey had convinced many she was not Amelia Earhart . But some wondered whether she was really Mrs. Guy Bolam , either .
