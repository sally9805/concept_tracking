Perskie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ State Legislature last summer , said he and other legislators from the area would meet in his office this morning to begin drafting a bill to govern casino operation . One proposed bill , written by Mr. Perskie , already is in the Legislature , but numerous objections have been raised to portions of it . During the sometime bitter campaign over the casinos , Mr. Perskie had said that Atlantic City would insist that casinos be operated only by honest and qualified businessmen and that it might take a year or more to get the first one in operation . An Atlantic City hotel owner who expects to get one of the first gambling licenses , Milton Neustadter , a partner in the Howard Johnson Regency , said casino approval by the voters was " the thing we have been praying for . " Atlantic City residents , who had reacted bitterly when voters rejected the 1974 casino amendment , were still somewhat angry .

The pro-casino groups spent more than $1 million in this year 's campaign , much of it during the last week . Atlantic City businessmen , who had seen their one-time premier resort town deteriorate , said that only gambling casi1os could rescue them from potential bankruptcy , and came forth with almost three-quarters of a million dollars to be used in promoting casinos . The remainder of the money came from other areas of the state and from companies hoping to get casino licenses . Organized under the name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ local public officials flooded New Jersey with assertions that financial benefits from casinos would spill over to other parts of the state .

The New Jersey Council of Churches , which led the fight against casinos , questioned the economic benefits promised by the pro-casino promoters , and accused the committee of holding out false hope to the state 's one million or so elderly and disabled residents that a tax on casino revenue would make life easier for them . Under the constitutional amendment voted on yesterday , any revenue from a gambling tax would be used in behalf of the elderly and disabled , although some pro-casino ads indicated that ti e state schools would also benefit . The Council of Churches argued that the ? income @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large as the casino promoters said it would be , would do little or nothing for most of the elderly . Problems Seen Compounded The Council of Churches said that it sympathized with the high unemployment rate in Atlantic City  --  l5 percent or more  --  but that opening casinos there would only compound the city 's financial problems . Casinos have not cured unemployment in Las Vegas , the council said , but have attracted many prostitutes , petty gamblers and organized crime .
