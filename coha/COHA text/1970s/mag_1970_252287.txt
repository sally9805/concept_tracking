Putnam. $6.95 . In nostalgic political memory , Alfred Emanuel Smith appears as a jaunty , cigar-chomping , roughhewn Irishman in a brown derby , the first serious Roman Catholic candidate for President , and the man who later turned on his aptest pupil , Franklin Roosevelt , to become a noisy opponent of the New Deal . All that is true as far as it goes-except that Smith was no more than half Irish . But the myth does little justice to the gifted , compulsive , frequently tormented man who created it in the first place . More important and more startling , as this pair of unevenly matched biographies show , the Al Smith myth entirely misses the man 's vital contribution to the art and science of government in the U.S. For it was through Smith that ethnic minorities in great American cities first found national voice and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writers of long standing , bring both knowledge , political empathy and personal affection to their biography of Smith . Onetime Hearst Journalist Richard O'Connor 's book is breezier and briefer , less analytical about Smith and less reflective about his special place in U.S. politics . <P> Smith 's reforming impulse was rooted in a compassion he learned from the near-slum environment in which he grew up .

As a backbench state assemblyman beginning in 1904 , he won friends among suspicious upstate legislators by entertaining them at weekly corned-beef-and-beer dinners .

As early as 1911 , he was also engaged in the fight for social reforms ( childlabor laws , maximum-work-hour legislation for women , factory safety regulations ) that made New York the most advanced welfare state in the nation , and in fact later provided a working example for F.D.R. 's New Deal . <P> To bring about such reforms , as well as to prosper politically , Smith made use of his own boundless energy and still legendary powers of persuasion and phrasemaking . " I could run on a Chinese laundry ticket and beat your bunch any time , " he once snapped at a hostile Democratic boss . He also could call on quite extraordinary mental abilities - among them a phenomenal memory for detail and a dazzling intuitive grasp of administrative structures . <P> Smith gradually enlisted a special brain trust-among them Robert Moses and Frances Perkins , later Roosevelt 's Secretary of Labor-who were the first modern-style technocrats in politics .
