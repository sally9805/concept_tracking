THE CAMPAIGN <P> THE battle for the summit of American political power this year has been a long and strange nonengagement . Yet on the democracy 's lesser plateaus-in Senate and House races , in gubernatorial campaigns-the two parties have been engaged in furious and more traditional partisan warfare . At stake are 18 statehouses , all 435 House seats and 33 chairs in the Senate-the nation 's balance of political power outside the Oval Office . <P> It is one of the anomalies of this campaign that Richard Nixon , with an almost Lyndonesque thirst for " consensus , " seems to have slighted those other battles . According to every indicator , the President now stands on the threshold of a personal triumph . The " born loser " of the early 1960s seems within reach of an overwhelming political victory : even millions of Democrats to whom he was once a partisan pariah will be pulling Republican levers . But Nixon , the loyal party man who owed so much to Republican Party workers down the line , now seems unwilling to share that popularity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party may be about to fumble its best opportunity in 20 years to build strength in the House and Senate during a presidential election year . Nixon seems equally oblivious to the party 's bid for statehouses . <P> Even with Nixon 's help , gaining control of Congress would be extremely difficult . The Republicans need a net gain of 39 seats in the House and five in the Senate . Realistically , party spokesmen now believe they will pick up only ten to 20 in the House and two in the Senate . Whatever further hopes they have depend not on any calculated White House strategy but on whims of the American people . If the voters reject McGovern 's candidacy to the point of giving Nixon a landslide on the scale of 1964 , enough congressional hopefuls may be swept into office to tip the balance of power . <P> Such hopes , however , hang on the very tattered threads of the " coattail " theory . Revisionist political scientists , looking back over old elections with new eyes , now wonder if coattails ever were very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years , three winning Presidents have actually run behind their party 's candidates for the House . In Politics , Presidents and Coattails , Political Scientist Malcolm Moos concludes : " The coattail influence of the presidential candidate has been demonstrated to be of minor significance . " <P> To be sure , in a growing age of independent voters there probably exists a cutoff point for ticket splitters . If Nixon can get past that point , then he might carry his entire party to victory . But Nixon has been doing almost no personal campaigning . Moreover , he and his staff have often denied party subalterns the money to work their own magic . While Nixon 's Committee for the Re-Election of the President has to scratch its head to think of ways to spend its anticipated $45 million budget ( bugging the Watergate was apparently one idea ) , the Republican Congressional Campaign Committee has only $3,800,000 to spread among 435 House candidates . Indeed , the C.R.P. has reached so deep into the pockets of big donors that Republican campaign managers across the country complain that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
