The lack of decent housing for poor people living in the nation 's largest cities has long been a national scandal . Doubtless it contributed to the fury of the race riots that plagued U.S. ghettos in the mid-1960s . In response , Congress in 1968 directed the Federal Housing Administration to help the poor buy homes in " high risk " areas by guaranteeing mortgages and sometimes subsidizing part of their mortgage payments . But with indictments last week in New York and Philadelphia and investigations under way elsewhere , that program itself was becoming a scandal in which the poor once again had become the victims of greedy speculators and corrupt Government officials . <P> The federal indictments charge that real estate dealers , lending institutions , lawyers and some FHA officials had conspired to inflate the reported value of cheap houses and sell them at high prices to people who could not really afford them . The ultimate loser was the U.S. taxpayer , since FHA guaranteed the mortgages and was left holding the low-value houses when the owners defaulted on their payments . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Romney , whose department includes the poorly administered FHA . In an eloquent if self-serving speech , Romney tried to divert attention to the broader problems of the ghetto , noting that bad housing was a result rather than a cause of ghetto squalor ( see box ) . <P> That in no way could excuse what the indictments contend has happened in New York , where a Brooklyn federal grand jury charged 40 individuals and ten firms with 500 specific criminal acts , including bribery , fraud , conspiracy and giving false statements to the Government . More indictments were expected , involving a possible loss to the Government of up to $200 million . <P> Already indicted were seven full-time FHA employees , two part-time FHA employees , eight real estate firms and ten lawyers . Shockingly , the indictments also named Dun &; Bradstreet , long the ultimate arbiter of the credit status of businesses and individuals , and one of the firm 's executives . The main lender indicted was Eastern Service Corp. , owned by Harry Bernstein and his wife Rose , one of the biggest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Long Island . <P> The Philadelphia indictments involved houses sold to Spanish-speaking residents . Two FHA inspectors and a real estate broker were charged . Nine other indictments involving FHA-mortgaged homes had been returned there earlier . Investigations of similar abuses or suits charging such frauds have begun in Detroit , Chicago , St. Louis , Boston , Miami , Seattle and Los Angeles . Similar indictments were handed down earlier this year in Paterson , N.J. <P> Falsified Forms . While details of the illegal transactions vary , a typical deal in New York worked this way : A real estate speculator would buy a ghetto house for $10,000 . He would find a poor but working black , induce him to buy the house for $200 down , and promise that monthly mortgage payments would be low , perhaps lower than his present rent . Before guaranteeing a mortgage , FHA would send an appraiser to check the value of the property . The appraiser , who was part of the conspiracy , would get $100 from the speculator for claiming that the property was worth $20,000 , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buyer would agree to pay that price .
