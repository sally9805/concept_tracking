ENTREAT ME NOT TO LEAVE THEE The options were clear : either place the aging invalid in a nursing facility or care for her at home . The decision was easy ; the family simply could n't part with Gram . by James A. Boyle , Jr Entreat me not to leave thee . ? Ruth 1:16 F irst he asked the score of the White Sox game . Then , a little later , he looked directly into my eyes and said , " Take care of Marie . " I pressed his hand and replied , " Do n't worry , Joe , we 'll always take care of her . " With that , he closed his eyes , sighed deeply , and died . I had seen men die . But I had never witnessed the special , selfless courage that my sleepy , quiet , " ordinary " father-in-law displayed on that hot day in July 1955 . It was a moment often recalled , and in that memory I could always hear his words , " Take care of Marie . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years , was never much of a chore . She was spirited , fun-loving , opinionated , and , at times , feisty . Most of all , she was fiercely independent and almost never sick . She subsisted on the interest earnings of modest funds derived from the sale of her home , which were augmented by small social security and civil service pensions . She was unique . She was " Gram . " Phase I Then one day it all changed . " Marion , " she shrieked into the phone , " come over here and see what they 're doing to me now . " My startled wife sped  --  with a daughter 's concern  --  to Gram 's apartment located about a mile from our home . There Marion found a greatly disturbed and angry Gram standing in the doorway of her ground-level apartment . " See what they 've done , " she whispered , pointing to a flower bed just outside her living room window . " What , Gram ? What are you pointing at ? " " Those leaves ! Those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flowers just to annoy me . " There , on a crisp and clear autumn morning , the long-ago promise to Joe was to demand fulfillment . At first the demand was modest . Gram would n't hear of moving in with us , and for days , and sometimes weeks , she would be normal in every respect . Slowly , her paranoia grew in intensity and duration . Finally , our constant reassurances were n't heard at all . Then one day Marion persuaded her to stay with us " for a while . " We had an extra second floor bedroom , and the stairs were easy enough for Gram to use . The change was immediate . As soon as she was relieved of the presence of her much maligned ( and absolutely innocent ) upstairs neighbors , all of her fears dropped away . She fitted into our noisy household of kids , cats , dog , TV 's , and confusion . Gram came back to normal and we all settled down . Peace at last ! We quietly told her that the apartment lease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our garage and in our basement . She never again seemed to want to live alone , but no special ceremony attended the subtle change from " temporary guest " to " member of household . " The change of dependency had gone quite well . We were pleased . Gram was content , and her little bank balance grew and grew  --  because she no longer had any expenses . Phase II I was at work in my office ( about six blocks from home ) in a tiny city in the far suburbs of Chicago . Again the phone . This time it was our ten-year-old daughter Gina : " Come home right now ! " " Why ? " " Never mind . Just come home right now ! " I had never heard her voice so full of horror and panic . The six blocks seemed forever . Then there she was . Gram , quiet on the kitchen floor ; Gina , weeping in the side yard ; and a pale , stricken Marion kneeling beside her suddenly helpless mother . " Take care of Marie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed for an indefinite time and to be slowly nursed back to health . Those inthe hospital assured us that Gram was " entitled " to a certain amount of time in a nursing home because her " stroke " had required hospitalization . " Medicare wo n't provide custodial care , but it will help with the nursing home care required for rehabilitation . " We simply could n't part with her . Nor could a tiny , middle-aged Marion and her huffing-puffing husband do all of those things that nursing home folks are supposed to do . We had a long , long talk . We talked of finances . We talked of nursing homes . We talked of what Gram had done for us . We talked of trying it " for a while . " Then Marion and I decided that we 'd do it our way and to hell with anyone who thought that we were being foolish . We concluded that Gram was " entitled " to more than prolonged hospital and nursing home care . She was " entitled " to our love , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No feelings of self-righteousness attended our judgment . No aura of nobility surrounded us . We just could n't send her away to what would be , at very best , a soft prison of possible neglect and inevitable loneliness . We were afraid , you see . We were afraid of forever remembering what we could have done when it would be too late to do it . It 's hard to recall the scenes of those hectic days . Ambulances , neighbors , paramedics , nurses , doctors , and long , white corridors are all merged in memory 's collage . But one clear image remains  --  a tiny , smiling , ancient lady in a hospital bed situated smack in the middle of our family room , watching the Cubs on TV . Marion guessed that she 'd need someone in the morning and until late afternoon to help care for Gram . We searched for and found a small corporation that would send nurse 's aides to the patients . The corporation charged $4.10 per hour for the hours that the aides actually spent with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anticipated pension income . She had a little more than $10,000 left . Her combined pensions amounted to about $195 per month . Thus , Gram could afford , for a while , to defray the cost of the special help , and we could afford the balance . Neither Medicare nor private insurance could help in such a nonprofessional program . We felt that we 'd only need the nurse 's aides on Monday through Friday , as I 'd be home to help on weekends . We rented a hospital bed , wheelchair , and portable commode , hired the nurse 's aides , and we were in business . With the establishment of our home nursing operation , we came to know a very special group of people , professional nurse 's aides , who were neither R.N. 's nor L.P.N. 's . Most of them were black , mid-20 's to middle-aged ladies . And they were great . All of them brought a remarkable range of skills and treated Gram with love , patience , and concern . After our program had been established for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as we had just about abandoned our outside social life , I thought that she needed a break from the demanding routine . An opportunity soon presented itself in the form of tour director for our local high school band , which had been invited to Florida . Our son Joe , a drummer in the band , went along , and the two of them stayed on for a short vacation after the band tour ended . Meanwhile , back at the nursing home , I increased the parade of nurse 's aides to round-the-clock service . It was odd to go to bed at night knowing that a total stranger was in the house , to be replaced by another stranger at breakfast time . But the arrangement worked beautifully . After three months , Gram was able to walk and to sleep in a regular bed , and she no longer needed the special equipment and nurses . So we had been restored as a family , complete with a lucid , functioning Gramma . And so it went for a few months . Phase III On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ running into the kitchen and fell in the doorway before anyone could catch her . It was n't a hard fall , and she had walked back into the family room afterward . That night Gram had to be Continued on page 98 Entreat Me Not continued from page 59 helped into bed , and the next morning she could barely walk with assistance . Once again , the ambulance , the hospital , and all the rest : endless forms to fill out , nurses , doctors , visits , and worry . This time her malady was diagnosed as a small , nondisplaced hip fracture . No surgery was indicated . She was safely assured of a long stay in the hospital practically cost-free , courtesy of both Medicare and Blue Cross . No doubt about it ! Gram had some really valuable " entitlements " this time . But once again that nagging inner voice : " What are they doing to her now ? What is she thinking ? " Gram was really disoriented in her hospital room . She did n't know where she was and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to be restrained or she would try to get out of bed . It was so hard to leave her , in confusion and uncertainty , tied to her bed each night . " Eventually , she 'll have to leave the hospital and go to a convalescent home , " was the gentle advice of her doctor . So there we were again . But this time we knew  --  or thought we knew  --  what would be expected of us . Could we give up our freedom and our household routines again ? Could Marion once more stand the rigors of such a task ? Could we really give adequate care to a completely immobilized lady ? Surely , no more could be expected of us . She had literally thousands and thousands of dollars ' worth of free " benefits " coming to her . Why should n't she take all of the " services " that she 's entitled to ? It did n't work . The thought of taking that frail , frightened lady to yet another " place " was more than the family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Phase IV This time we had a really sick patient . The job was to be tougher , the problems more complex . Fortunately , the master bedroom and its bathroom adjoined the first floor family room . Gram would have to have more privacy and quiet . The answer was obvious . We took all of the furniture out of our bedroom and stored it in the garage . And there it was , a cheerful , bright , convenient hospital room . Back came the hospital bed and the other equipment , and the nurse 's aides . I remember the night Gram came home from the hospital . I awoke late and went softly into her room . She was awake and was looking at me . " Who are you ? " she asked . " I 'm Marion 's husband . " She just said " Oh , " but continued to stare at me in suspicion . Just then our kitten , Daisy , brushed against my leg . On impulse , I picked up Daisy and placed her on the bed near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fur , her face softened and a little smile came and lingered . She still did n't know who I was , but if I liked cats I could n't be all that bad . Eventually , Gram drifted off to sleep , Daisy scampered away , and I went back to my new sleeping quarters , musing , " Midnight kitten-therapy . Try to get that in a nursing home  --  at any price ! " That episode was to be repeated again and again because it brought Gram love and gave her memories of better , happier years . Each of us in the family had his own special way of making Gram smile . It was n't a chore to visit her . It was impossible to forget her . She was still with us . During Gram 's ordeal , two very special people came into our lives . One was a physician and surgeon who was a Doctor of Osteopathy ; the other was a sprite of a girl who was a nurse 's aide and a devoutly strict Dutch Christian Reformed disciple . Both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saints . The doctor ( who had attended Gram in the hospital ) would " just happen to be passing by " on a Sunday night or on a Wednesday morning . He 'd come in , examine Gram , prescribe medicine , and give advice to Marion . He never sent a bill , though we often requested one . Jan , the little nurse 's aide , came to love Gram and , in turn , to be loved by all of us . Thank God that both of those dear people also had an affection for animals . There were always one dog and at least one cat as interested sniffers of medical bags and apparatus . Fulfillment We ca n't remember when we came to know it , because it came so quietly , so naturally . Gram was slowly losing her hold on life , and nothing could restore it . She became incoherent , incontinent , bewildered , and seemed only to want to sleep . She could no longer eat solid foods . Special skills had to be learned . Probably the most exasperating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be known by all as " that damned catheter . " It was n't that the skill needed to install and to maintain it was so hard to learn . The problem was political . It seemed that catheters were in the special custody of certain persons licensed by law to install , remove , and replace them . A " mere " nurse 's aide simply could not be " authorized " to perform such a complex medical procedure . Not only that , but a " lay person " could n't buy one . The corporation that supplied the nurse 's aides had the answer . They provided an R.N. who would perform that service " by appointment and as required . " So on Her schedule , Her Arrogancy would appear , complete with frozen face , starched hat , and patronizing comments . She never stayed long enough to see if the necessary result was achieved and , too often , it was n't . Finally , we 'd had enough ! Under the careful tutoring of a gracious neighbor ( an R.N. ) Marion and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out that its employee was doing an " unauthorized act , " a phone command told me that such activity must cease . I suggested that it was my home and my mother-in-law and that what transpired within either was none of their business . In the face of such ire ( and in respected memory of many checks mailed to them in the past ) it suddenly became " permissible . " They stopped giving Jan a hard time . Jan finally figured out a way of purchasing the devices . Problem solved ! The next big problem was nutrition . Because I like to cook , I took over the task of chief dietician . I learned to make a kind of " astronaut soup , " which would incorporate the ingredients necessary for a complete diet . The cooking techniques were controlled so that the natural nutrients would be preserved . The end product was then put through a food blender and frozen in little serving portions . For nearly four months Gram lived on that diet , augmented by juices , water , tea , and Jell-O @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enjoy her ( spoon-fed ) meals . Pushing the fluids was n't so easy , as Gram would store them in her cheeks , like a petulant little squirrel , and would swallow only with considerable reluctance . Bitter winter ended and the first green of spring appeared . With it came our final problem . " What will we do if Gram goes into a coma and we can no longer feed her or give her water ? " How could one answer such a question ? Another long conference was inevitable . It came to pass and it was tearful and agonizing . We struggled for objectivity and prayed for wisdom . Neither came easily . Our gentle doctor had assured us that Gram had only weeks left and that nothing , other than temporary life-preserving techniques , could prolong the inevitable . We came to the conclusion that our obligation was to offer the food and drink of life as long as she lived . Further , we were bound to do everything possible to keep her free from pain . We then decided that the only reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " intensive care " of a hospital would be to relieve pain that we were powerless to control . The ambulance , then , would await such pain , and nothing else would bring it . Thereafter , fluids or Jell-O were placed in her mouth whenever she could be awakened . She could n't swallow anything else . She slept constantly except when aroused to take those liquids . She showed no signs of pain or of distress of any kind . " She wo n't last more than a few days . " " How can you tell ? " " Because I just know it . " It was a short but profound exchange . I still do n't know how Marion could speak with such certainty . There was something in her voice and in her face that convinced me that there was no room for doubt . I had almost no time left to solve the last problem . In our society there are rules , regulations , edicts , statutes , ordinances , and mandates that attend our every experience " from the womb to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to figure out how to care for Gram in life that Continued on following page there just was no thought given to the procedure to be followed at death . After all , what do you do then ? To complicate matters , Gram had willed her body to a medical school , and she had been most emphatic that we do nothing to frustrate her intent . She carried a card in her wallet , which stated no more than that her body was to be given to a named organization , and the address and phone number were indicated . Perhaps a phone call would do it . I placed a call at about 5:00 p.m. one evening , and a crisply efficient female voice assured me that I was calling the right place . I explained the facts and that I wanted to be made aware of the procedure to be followed . Her response was  --  to say the least  --  one of the strangest I 've ever heard . I was scolded for attempting to deliver a body to her employer before if was dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , after-hours , phone-answering service . The next day , I found that the matter was simple to handle . A mortician of my choice would deliver the body whenever a death certificate had been signed . The doctor assured me that he would bring , fill in , and sign such a certificate whenever I called him to pronounce the death . All of those inquiries had to be made in the solitude of my own judgment and in the frustration of my ignorance . How could Marion be asked to face a death that she was still not quite ready to accept ? Her fight for her mother 's life was intensifying . There seemed to be nothing at all left for me to do . The hours of waiting had come . It then occurred to me that I had overlooked the Roman Catholic tradition of our family . None of us had spoken of calling a priest . Gram had no need for " confession " ? her life testified to that . But what about the " Last Sacrament " ? those hauntingly beautiful phrases and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what value would that be to Gram ? We did n't know whether it would have value ; neither did we know that it would be valueless . Things not done cause regret , and regret causes grief . With that in mind , and with Marion 's permission , I set the stage for one of the most moving vignettes I 'll ever see . There , beside our deeply sleeping Gram , stood a young man in priestly garb , softly ( so as not to awaken her ) saying words of atonement , faith , and hope . His hands touched her , ever so gently , and touched our hearts as well . Beside him gentle Jan , helping him , in solemn and wide-eyed attention ; and there in the doorway , a little white dog and two great cats all seated and uncharacteristically still , watching the priest and Gram . Early the next evening , on April 20 , 1977 , Gram , with her family nearby , quietly and serenely died . The good doctor came as he said he would . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of hours . Then the women in the family bathed Gram , whose tiny , withered body had not one bed sore or needle mark . They combed her hair , put her in a never-worn , pretty nightgown , and placed her hands together in repose . That was our wake . No ritual prayer , no clatter of conversation , just a quiet last good-bye and a kiss . I was alone . The family had gathered in another room as none could bear seeing our Gram taken away . I watched them carry the now shrouded body across the lawn to the waiting hearse . Then soft tears came , and into a fresh , warm spring breeze I whispered a prayer . " Please take care of Marie . " Afterword This little story was written for two reasons . The first was to pay a lasting tribute to the most beautiful and devoted woman I will ever know . She worked , and at times slaved , in an act of love that was beyond anything I have ever seen . She is my wife Marion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was she who kept my promise to her dad . The other reason for writing this was to offer encouragement to those who want to keep the " old folks at home , " but who hesitate to break their social routines and to ignore the well-intentioned advice of their peers . We were lucky . The regimen of Gram 's home treatment worked no financial hardship on us . Others not so fortunate ought to be helped by a revision of the Medicare and Medicaid laws . After all , based on nothing more than pure pragmatism , it 's a sensible thing for our society to do . It had cost less than $12,000 to give Gram the necessary help and equipment . That saved the American taxpayers a sum in excess of $75,000 for less effective " benefits . " It will be asked , I suppose , " what can a man know of what Marion did , and what does she feel about it ? " The answer was given last week  --  more than a year after Gram died . The TV blared in outrage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elderly in state-approved nursing homes . Marion turned to me and said , " Would n't you love to go and gather all of them up and bring them home ? " No hint of criticism is hereby intended of those who have , for any number of reasons , been unable to give their elderly loved ones home care . No one can pass such judgment upon others . But much can and should be done by all of us to demand that , wherever they are , our aged should live and be allowed to die in decency , tenderness , respect , and peace . Those are the obligations of humanity . The nonfulfillment of that obligation is our nation 's most shameful area of neglect of " human rights . " Cycles continued from page 48 ate program designed to accelerate the other , upward half of the cycle . The burning of coal fills the air with irritating and poisonous molecules of sulfur dioxide and with bits of fly ash . We could , if we wish , wait for the rain to wash the air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Human beings must take a hand , devise processes to clean the coal before it is burned , use filters or precipitators to hold back the fly ash , a desulfurization process to remove the sulfur dioxide . The advantage of the human effort is not only that it is certain and quick but that it can turn pollution into useful products ( as bacteria do when they break down natural wastes ) . When rain washes down the fly ash and sulfur dioxide , it dirties the land and acidifies the ground water . The human effort to hold back the fly ash and sulfur dioxide can convert the former into useful land fill and the latter into useful sulfuric acid , perhaps the most valuable of all industrial chemicals . Except for radioactive wastes ( which are a special problem ) there are no forms of pollution produced by man that ca n't be unpolluted given three things : energy , human ingenuity and determination , and time . Energy is required to drive the upward half of the cycle ( and we ca n't get away from that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supply is winding down , energy is a particularly crucial situation . Alternate sources : coal , tides , wind , running water , earth 's internal heat , nuclear fusion , the sun  --  again given human ingenuity and determination . Time ? We must use as little of that as possible . The upward half of the cycle must take no longer than the downward half or we wo n't be able to keep up . This means we must not only speed de-pollution as much as we can , but we must hold back on pollution ; find out ways of decreasing pollution without braking our technology , and that can be done  --  given human ingenuity and determination . So it all boils down to one thing after all  --  human ingenuity and determination .
