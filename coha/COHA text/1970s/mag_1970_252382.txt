Hawaii this week becomes the first state in the Union to legalize abortion on request , leaving the decision about the operation to the woman herself and her physician . The legislature completed passage of the bill last week and sent it to Governor John A. Burns . A Roman Catholic , Burns said he would not sign it but neither would he veto it . Unsigned , it becomes law in ten days . <P> The Hawaiian law is essentially what many physicians have been urging-so far , unsuccessfully-in several mainland states . It includes only minimal restrictions : the operation must involve a fetus that can not live outside the womb ( usually meaning less than 20 weeks of gestation ) ; it must be performed by a licensed physician or surgeon ( M.D. or doctor of osteopathy ) , and in a Government-licensed hospital . By comparison , the " liberalized " abortion laws passed by ten states , led by Colorado in 1967 , require that each abortion must be approved by two or more disinterested physicians . All specify some medical need , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or a likelihood that the baby will be defective . Britain is somewhat more lenient than these states , but still stipulates pre-operation approval by more than one doctor . The District of Columbia is now in a legal limbo , since Federal Judge Gerhard A. Gesell declared the restrictive District code unconstitutional because it was too vague . Gesell 's ruling is subject to reversal on appeal . Meanwhile , abortion is available in the District , but many residents complain that it is difficult to obtain . <P> Like every other jurisdiction that has liberalized its abortion law , Hawaii was fearful of becoming an " abortion capital . " So the legislators wrote in a 90-day residency requirement . Some concede that this may be unconstitutional , but they worded it so that the rest of the statute is unassailable . Hawaii thus becomes the first major jurisdiction in the Western world in which abortion is treated as an exclusively medical matter . Any woman over 20 can have one for the asking if she can find a doctor willing to perform it .     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
