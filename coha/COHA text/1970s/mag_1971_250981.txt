In 1942 , when French Undersea Explorer Jacques Cousteau explored the Sargasso Sea , he could see underwater for about 300 ft . Today , he reports , the visibility has shrunk to barely 100 ft . When he first started diving in the Mediterranean 25 years ago , it was filled with life . Today ? " You can hardly see a fish 3 in. long . " What has happened is that pollution has caught up with the seas ' and oceans ' ability to cleanse themselves . Cousteau estimates that the vitality of the seas , in terms of fish and plant life , has declined some 30% to 50% in the past 20 years . <P> In recent weeks , Cousteau and other worried specialists have been spelling out just how polluted the seas and oceans have become . Testifying before a United Nations symposium on the environment in Geneva , Swiss Marine Explorer Jacques Piccard warned that if nothing is done , all the oceans will be dead before the end of the century . Cousteau , who speaks with the authority of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deep waters , told Senator Ernest Rolling 's subcommittee on oceans and atmosphere that even the remote reef off Madagascar is " frankly dead today . " In a very few years , he added , " there will be nothing alive " in the deeper waters of the Black Sea and the Red Sea . <P> Scientists point out that while water covers 70% of the earth 's surface , it is a covering only , quite thin when compared with the bulk of the globe as a whole . It can not be treated as a bottomless sewer , capable of absorbing any amount of pollution . In fact , says Piccard , " Phytoplankton , the primitive plant life that generates most of the earth 's oxygen , is surface matter . It absorbs dirt and acts as a sort of pollution filter . Thus all you need to knock out is the surface phytoplankton , and the entire marine life cycle is fatally disrupted . " That disruption is accelerating logarithmically . At one Baltic measuring station , Environmentalist Barry Commoner points out , the oxygen content @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The figure gently declined to 2.0 cc. by 1940 , but in only 30 years since then it has plummeted to 0.1 cc . <P> Piccard estimated that what he calls Homo technicus releases between 5,000,000 and 10,000,000 tons of polluting petroleum products every year to float on the seas ' sensitive surface . Up to 1.8 million tons come from automobile exhaust emissions which rise into the atmosphere and eventually precipitate onto the ocean surface . Tankers spill another million . The world 's polluted rivers spew out the rest . <P> To help combat the problem of ocean pollution , Cousteau is pushing for expanded research , especially by such tools as the " Sky Lab " satellite for underwater observation , which could spot and measure concentrations of pollution . He has also called upon the 14 industrialized nations that he estimates are responsible for 80% of the oceans ' pollution to join forces and act quickly-before it is too late .
