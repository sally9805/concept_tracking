More often than not , crusaders for causes try to rally support by glooming over the darkness of their situation . So why is this man smiling ? Sitting in his pine-paneled office at the mid-Manhattan headquarters of the American Civil Liberties Union , Executive Director Aryeh Neier , 37 , is saying happily these days , " This is the best single moment for civil liberties in the past dozen years . " The statement may be impolitic , but Neier has a point . <P> Lately , the A.C.L.U. has been running up a remarkable record . When impeachment of Richard Nixon still seemed improbable , the organization was providing Congress and the public with extensive arguments for it . It successfully lobbied for strengthening the Freedom of Information Act and is behind a new law that will allow citizens to challenge most personal data in Government computers . The A.C.L.U. also has a major case on the rights of mental patients now before the Supreme Court . On top of all that , there is the $12 million it won last month for 1,200 May @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Last week volunteers and staffers were sorting through the 1,200 pieces of mail that have swamped the A.C.L.U. Washington office , seeking , in the words of one May Day participant , " a share of this delicious windfall . " The A.C.L.U. is checking claims against a court computer list of those arrested at or near the Capitol on May 5 , 1971 . So far , 400 to 500 applicants appear to qualify . <P> No Lawyer . The shy overseer of all this success came to the A.C.L.U. from Hitler 's Germany . Born in Berlin in 1937 , Aryeh ( Hebrew for lion and pronounced Ar-eeay ) Neier ( rhymes with higher ) was taken to London at the age of two to escape the Nazis ; after the war , he moved with his family to New York City . Young Aryeh went through the city 's public school system and on to Cornell , where he organized a speakers ' group that made a show of inviting a Daily Worker editor to lecture when the City College of New York refused to let him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thomas , then succeeded him as director of the League for Industrial Democracy , a union lobbying group . From lobbying , he switched to editing Current magazine before joining the A.C.L.U. as a field-development officer in 1962 . <P> Neier , who is not a lawyer , was picked to lead the A.C.L.U. in 1970 , following a six-year stint as head of the New York affiliate . By then , the 55-year-old civil liberties group had already begun to move away from its strictly legal approach . In the past , the A.C.L.U. had generally entered a civil liberties case by filing a brief as amicus curiae ( friend of the court ) . In 1968 the organization turned to more direct action ; its attorneys served as defense lawyers in the Spock conspiracy trial . In the face of internal disagreement , A.C.L.U. activists convinced colleagues that the new course was the only realistic response to a prosecution that attacked free speech .
