txt A guy can make a fortune in this fast-paced age of change if he can just come up with some new , modern product that catches the fancy . Some guys did it with computers . Others did it with the miniskirt . Gene O'Neill did it'with buggy whips . Now , you might think there 's not much market these days for a buggy whip . That 's what a lot of fellows have thought , ever since about 1910 . Which is why Mr. O'Neill has become a prosperous man since that day 10 years ago when he made his first 100 whips in the basement of his home . Right here in this wide spot on U.S. Highway 71 that claims a population of 200 is living proof that the buggy whip , that popular symbol of a product whose time has passed , is booming . Mr. O'Neill 's whip factory here ? an old bank building that he bought for $800 ? and another plant of his in Winnipeg , Canada , turned out more than 100,000 whips last year , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year . Moreover , he says he sees no reason that rate of growth ca n't be maintained year after year . Capturing the Whip Market Not all that business is in-buggy whips , which Mr. O'Neill sells to harness racers and to Amish people in Pennsylvania . Wonder Whip , Mr. O'Neill 's company , also turns out stockyard whips , show whips , training whips , cart whips , hog whips , horse whips , sorting whips , race whips and lunge whips . Mr. O'Neill has several things going for him . People are riding more horses . Harness racing is getting more popular . Most important , though , Mr. O'Neill makes a real 20thCentury whip . Indeed , he may have made the first basic improvements in your ordinary whip in centuries . It all started back in 1960 when Mr. O'Neill was% running a failing saddlery store in Spencer , ' not far from here . One day , a fellow from Spencer Foods , a local company , mentioned to him that the firm 's stockyard whips did n't last very long because the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made of a reed-andrawhide core covered with braided linen and sporting a leather handle and many coats of varnish , has a tip , called the popper , that is built into it ; when the popper snaps off , the whip is rendered useless . ) Mr. O'Neill started spending long hours at Spencer Foods ' cattle chutes , studying the way whips were falling apart . Then he headed for his basement and came up with a better whip . He used glass fiber rods that do n't break in winter or wilt in summer for the cores ; tough , braided plastic that does n't shrink in rain for the covering , and rubber-like plastic for the handles . And he made the poppers replaceable . Then he patented the whole thing and called it Wonder Whip . As a result , the 45-year-old Mr. O'Neill now serves more than a third of the nation 's whip market . " Wonder Whips certainly last longer , " says Jack Martin , who stocks them in his Libertyville ( 111 . ) Riding and Saddle Shop . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ titan Gene 's , " says John Norman , purchasing agent for Spencer Foods , which bought Mr. O'Neill 's first whips . Mr. O'Neill has also managed to make customers happy another way ? he does n't raise prices . Wonder Whips still sell for from $3.50 to $6 . A Furtive Business Mr. O'Neill has held the price line by turning whip-making into a snap . As he can reluctantly demonstrate , he can turn out a finished whip in less than five minutes , compared with the several days it takes to braid and varnish a traditional whip . He continually tinkers with procedures and machinery in the old bank building here to even ktuther increase the productivity of his nine employes . Mr. O'Neill does n't like to demonstrate his production process for competitive reasons . Wonder Whip is such a hit that other whipmakers  --  there are three major ones and a host of tiny ones  --  are turning increasingly to glass fiber and plastic . In fact , some of them have even turned to Mr. O'Neill 's patented design . " So far I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case alone cost me $12,000 in legal fees , " Mr. O'Neill says glumly . " I 've Concluded that patents do n't protect me from anything ; they just give me a license to defend myself . I think the best bet is just to keep things a secret . " Thus , when quitting time comes each afternoon at the Wonder Whip building here , a cover ' goes on top of the machine that performs a key operation so snoopers ca n't peek through the big front window . Materials are also carefully locked away , and all nine employes seal their lips when they walk out the door . Mr. O'Neill also likes to keep mum about how much money Wonder Whip makes him , although he ca n't resist dropping a few hints . Like the fact that except for one $3,000 loan long ago paid-off the company has no debt . For new equipment , expansion of the little plant and other improvements , " we just take ( money ) out of the company savings account , " he says . Mr. O'Neill is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jo An and two of his four children reside year-round in a new , handsome home in the resort area around Lake Okoboji , where waterfront lots alone run around $25,000 . A sleek motor launch is tied up at his private dock 25 yards behind the house and a four-passenger plane is sheltered in his own hangar at a nearby airstrip . Mr. O'Neill says in all his flying around to visit customers and promote whips , he keeps running into people who are amazed that there 's still such a thing as a whip company . But none of them are quite as dumbfounded as the lady who called up the whip factory here one day and ordered a case of Wonder Whip . " A case ? " Mr. O'Neill asked . " What for ? " Well , the lady said , her church was planning its fall harvest dinner and she thought Wonder Whip sounded like great stuff to put on top of the pumpkin pie .                    @
