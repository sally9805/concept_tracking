txt Slowly and timidly , refugees from Uganda who have slipped over the Kenyan border in the last few days told here today of a wave of death , fear and intimidation that drove many of them to flee without their families . T. KAUFMAN New York Times They spoke in the anteroom of the United Nations High Commission on Refugees as they waited to fill out applications for asylum . Their stories were similar to those told by refugees who have been arriving since Uganda 's Anglican Archbishop died in mysterious circumstances Feb. 16 after being accused of plotting to overthrow President Idi Amin . But their accounts carried the seeming authenticity of repetition . The refugees kept drifting into the commission office all during the morning . Almost all were members of the predominantly Christian Lango and Acholi tribes , which according to previous accounts have been undergoing a purge as suspected sources of opposition to Field Marshal Amin . Archbishop Janani Luwum was an Acholi . The Amin Government said he had died in an auto accident . African churchmen and others said he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intellectuals or professionals , doctors , engineers , students and civil servants . None would give their names for publication . Some would not talk at all to strangers . But 12 did . They asserted that the national campaign against the two tribes had not yet reached the proportions of the persecution of five years ago , but that the death toll was mounting . A few thousand have disappeared in the last two weeks , the refugees said , and they are thought to be dead . Thousands more are reported in flight and hiding . A spokesman for the United Nations High Commission on Refugees refused today to disclose how many Ugandans had registered at his office within the last week , saying this information was " sensitive . " One young Acholi civil servant recalled that he had returned to his village on Feb. 18 to begin his vacation holiday . The village is in the north and once had 2,000 people , most of them related by clan ties . Since 1972 , he said , 200 or 300 have been taken away by police authorities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " When I came back I learned 10 people had been seized , including my cousins , " he said . " There was a school teacher , a headmaster , some businessmen . " He said that members of the state research bureau , President Amin 's security organization , were in the village . " You can easily identify them , " he went on . " They are strangers but do not act like strangers . They are big and very dark men , members of Amin 's Kakwa tribe and though they wear civilian clothes they carry pistols . " The day after he arrived , his closest friend , with whom he had spent the previous night , was seized . He was frightened and the next day left his wife of two months and paid $16 to be hidden among bags of charcoal on a truck heading toward the Kenyan border . Gets Help in Crossing Border . In the town of Tororo , still in Uganda , he met some people who agreed to guide him across the frontier . " They were very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said . For the three days he has been in Kenya he has slept in churches . Another refugee , a Lango who had been a student in a large town , said he came home from classes to the house he shared with an uncle , a retired police officer . The student saw a crowd in front of the house and the yard was littered with books , papers and wrecked furniture . A neighbor quickly took him to her house and told him his uncle had been seized . While he was in the neighbor 's house , a child came to get him and led him to yet another house . There he met a cousin who was an officer in the army and two other Lango officers , all in civilian clothes . He said they told him there had been serious fighting in their barracks , with other tribes killing Langos and Acholis . " They said they had decided to flee to Tanzania and asked me to join them , " the student recalled . " I knew my money would not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car and crossed into Kenya I remained while they continued on . " Massacre of Soldiers Described The students said that on the journey the fleeing officers had told him that Lango and Acholi soldiers had been massacred at the barracks of the Tiger and Simba battalions in the towns of Mubende and Mbarara . He said he had been told that 1,000 to 1,500 had been killed at the two camps . Another refugee listening in interjected : " Use the low figure . The high totals are guesswork . There could be that many , there could be even more , but it becomes unimaginable . " The official version of these events , as given by President Amin , was that tribesmen in the army had attempted to mutiny in two widely separated places and that seven soldiers were killed before order was restored . All of the refugees interviewed today said in response to questions that everyone they knew had relatives or friends who disappeared in the six years since President Amin took power . ' A Reign of Terror ' In 1975 , the International Commission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Amin ushered in a reign of terror worse than anything in recent African history . " The report  --  based on testimony of witnesses who insisted on anonymity  --  concluded that 25,000 to 250,000 Ugandans had disappeared or been killed . The most harrowing story told today by refugees at the United Nations offices was by a young man who had been arrested on Feb. 22 and released on Feb. 27 . He had been a clerk in a Government office and was neither Lango nor Acholi , but had many friends from these tribes . " I was with Lango and Acholi people and that is why they took me , " he said . - le noted that his rather had also been seized , in 1975 , and had disappeared . The refugee said he was taken to Naguru prison in Kampala , where he was Dlaced in a cell measuring perhaps 25 Feet square . At times , he said , there were Is many as SO people with him . Periodically , names would be called out by the military police . The refugee said that people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be killed . During his own interrogation , he said , he was forced to place his head in a tire rim while police beat and kicked him around his kidneys . He was repeatedly asked what role he had played in what was described as a plot to overthrow President Amin on Jan. 25 . On his first night in jail he was called out to help load 12 bodies into a truck . " The skulls of the dead men were crushed , " he said . During the next six days , he said , he saw from his cell that men were being killed with hammers by military policemen . The man , short and thin , was tired . His eyes were red and bleary and he came I close to tears several times as he spoke . I He said he believed that in the time he was in the prison he helped load 120 bodies onto trucks . His cellmates , he said , were largely professional people , churchmen and businessmen . ' The Crying Was Terrible ' " Some prayed , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terrible , terrible . " Among the bodies he put on trucks were those of two friends arrested with him , the refugee said . He said he thought he had been released because " I was not Lango or Acholi . " The authorities kept his identity papers , without which travel was difficult , and told him to report every Monday and . Friday . The night of his release he slept " in the bush , " and then made his way to a friend to borrow money . He said he began his escape by local bus , but he declined to describe his route " because there are many , many who still want to come . " He acknowledged , though , that he had received help along the way . When the International Commission of Jurists issued its report on Uganda , it ' took note of the enormous fear of reprisals , saying that not a single witness would give permission for the use of his or her name . The commission said , however , that in each case cited in its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . However , there have been some cases in the past where , from exile , prominent Ugandans have publicly charged Mr. Amin 's Government with wholesale ; laughter . Among these are Wanume Kibedi , a former Minister of Foreign Affairs who  --  in an open letter to Mr. Amin ? listed dozens of " disappearances. " a word he said was in Uganda " a euphemism for dead . " In his long condemnation , he wrote : " Thousands of people since the inception of your misrule have been liquidated for personal , political or factional reasons , entirely outside the process of law . " One of the refugees said today that , except for President Amin 's Kakwa tribe , " I do n't think there is a family , in Uganda that has not lost someone who has disappeared or been murdered .
