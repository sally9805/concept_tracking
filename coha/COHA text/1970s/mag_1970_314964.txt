Extract from the posthumous papers of John H. Watson , M.D. : <P> Holmes put down his teacup , filled his pipe with shag and commenced : <P> " You have noted , Watson , in The Adventure of the Empty House , that after my disappearance , I wandered for two years throughout Tibet spending some time with the High Lama . Whilst in that country , I studied the space-time continuum and learned to forecast the future . " <P> " Preposterous . " <P> " Rudimentary , once you get the hang of it , " he replied . Examining the dregs of his tea , he continued , " I see myself in the next century played by a number of actors on jiggling celluloid . Raymond Massey , Basil Rathbone-hello ! what 's this ? - Here I am in 1970 , in The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes . " <P> " I say , Holmes , am I . . . ? " <P> " Yes , Watson , you are in it , portrayed at last as the oaken heart that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by that busker of amiable distinction , Mr. Robert Stephens . " <P> " Good show , Holmes , " said I , reaching for the tantalus and the gasogene . <P> " Hardly , Watson . My Private Life is directed by one Billy Wilder , a Vi ennese . From such a man one has the right to expect either gothica , like Sun set Boulevard , or antic farce , such as Some Like It Hot . Instead , we are presented with what future critics will call " Some Like It Tepid , " a listless ac count of ourselves v. the Kaiser 's agents . Moreover , it portrays me as inept . A lady twists me ' round her finger . " " Mmmmm . " <P> " And my brother Mycroft catches me in an intellectual trap . " <P> " Holmes , it is only a film . " <P> " And you and I , as longtime room mates , are mistaken for - ah - consenting adults . " <P> " Sacrilege ! Infamy ! Libel ! " I slashed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Even during those lonely days in Afghanistan , I never so much as glanced at a subaltern ! " <P> " Quite , " said Holmes drily . " Personally , I admire parody - when it pinks the host , not the parasite . Wilder never understood his subjects well enough to satirize us . He is even off in his details - my brother , for instance , is played by the lean Christopher Lee . As you have noted in The Greek Interpreter , Mycroft is ' absolutely corpulent . ' The entire effort may , I think , be ascribed to an insufficiency of imagination , not unlike Sir Henry Baskerville 's . " <P> " Too impudent , " I said , staring at the scattered tea leaves . <P> " On the contrary , Watson . Not impudent enough . For me , the mystery contained in this opus has but one satisfactory solution . A 7% solution . " <P> So saying , he reached for his sy ringe and his cocaine and was soon in a mist impenetrable even by pastiche . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
