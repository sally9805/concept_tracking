THE physician and comedian Jonathan Miller once pooled his two professional skills to describe the symptoms of a rare disease called cataplexy . Its victims are physically unable to laugh , though they desperately want to . " As they are about to laugh , " Dr. Miller explained , " they are seized by a total paralysis and they slither helpless to the floor . " The paralysis ends only when the impulse to laugh leaves them : the price of health is absolute sobriety . <P> Cataplexy-a sadistic punishment that might have been designed for the ninth circle of Dante 's hell-threatens to become a metaphor for the condition of humor in the 1970s . At the moment , the silent absence of laughter is deafening , though the will to laugh is agonizingly there . Where are the wits of yesterday ? The game is a humiliation to play . <P> When Miller wrote about cataplexy-almost ten years ago-he and his fellow Beyond the Fringers were about to bring their antic **25;4793;TOOLONG to Broadway . <P> Mike Nichols and Elaine May were catching with awful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wordy death just about everything , including sex . <P> If nothing else , TV offered the elaborate spoofs of Sid Caesar 's Show of Shows . Mort Sahl , carrying a rolled-up newspaper like a blunt weapon , had set almost academic standards for the stand-up comedian as social critic . Lenny Bruce , Salvationist manque , was preaching his credo of holy scatology and apocalypse , " trying to panic people into laughing , " as Sahl put it . <P> Humor was not just funny : it was seriously funny in those days . Tragedy was dean-everybody accepted that . But comedy was managing double duty , in plays like Samuel Beckett 's Waiting for Godot , Eugene lonesco 's Rhinoceros , even Edward Albee 's Who 's Afraid of Virginia Woolf ? Audiences laughed until quite literally they cried . In fiction , the selling phrase was " black humor . " Some of the best books of the ' 60s came out ghastly-funny , as if novelists were facing nuclear-age madness , crossed eyeballs to crossed eyeballs : Terry Southern in his underrated little masterpiece @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Kurt Vonnegut Jr . in Mother Night , Saul Bellow in Herzog . <P> <P> Yet the early ' 60s already seem another world . Somewhere along the line , the theater of the absurd turned into the theater of cruelty , homosexuality became the matinee audience 's concept of the in-joke , and Neil Simon went for meaning in the third act . The Beatles ran out of put-ons , and John Lennon took to bed . In accordance with Aubrey 's Law , sitchcom has swamped or drowned television 's handful of comic talents . Some Like It Hot shuddered into M*A*S*H , and the situation of cinematic comedy became a question of semantics . Debating topic : Is Catch-22 a " funny " film or a demonstration of cataplexy all by itself ?
