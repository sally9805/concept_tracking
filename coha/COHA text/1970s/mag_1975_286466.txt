" I 'm a Master Mind junkie , " says Molly Rambler , a teacher from Englewood , N.J. " I ca n't go to bed at night until I play a couple of games . " The game creating such helpless addiction is an import from Britain . Since Master Mind first came on the market two years ago , 5 million sets have been bought in 60 different countries . Since last spring , 85,000 Master Mind sets have been sold in the U.S. at prices from $2.50 to $20 . Thousands of players are addicted . <P> The game is the invention of Amateur Mathematician Mordechai Meirovich , a postal employee in Israel , who first displayed it at the 1971 Nrnberg Toy Fair . There it was spotted by scouts from Invicta Plastics , a games manufacturer in Leicester . Invicta immediately recognized the potential of Meirovich 's simple game and went to work producing , packaging and selling four different models . <P> In the basic model of Master Mind , one player , known as the " codemaker , " picks four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in any order he chooses under a shield on one side of a board . The object of his opponent , the " codebreaker , " is to place four pegs in holes on his side of the board , attempting to duplicate the color and order of the hidden pegs in a maximum of ten tries . After the codebreaker has set up his four pegs , the codemaker gives clues by placing in four small holes either black markers ( for correct color , correct position ) , white markers ( correct color , wrong position ) or no markers ( wrong color ) . The codebreaker next arranges another row of pegs and is given more clues , repeating the process until he has deduced the hidden " code . " Then the players switch positions ; the winner is the one who figures out the code in the least number of tries . <P> As their expertise increases , players can try out more complicated variations of the game . Explains Jose Ballester , assistant games buyer for the Brentano 's bookstore chain : " Chance plays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it 's logic . " In fact , manufacturers of educational materials such as Cuisenaire in New Rochelle , N.Y. , and J.L. Hammett based in Braintree , Mass , are already promoting the game to teach logic in the classroom . <P> Why is Master Mind so popular ? Despite the complexity of some of the advanced versions of the game , says Gene Lewallen , a student at Georgia State University in Atlanta , " it 's easy to understand the rules , and it 's not long and drawn out like chess average time to crack the code : 15 minutes . " Lis Nygaard , a television producer from Toronto , plays Master Mind on planes . She became a fan because , " You can break the ice with people . You get to know a lot about them : how they think , even what colors they like . " <P> What lies ahead for the U.S. may well be seen in Britain , where Master Mind has reached epidemic proportions . There Games and Puzzles magazine regularly carries letters arguing the strategy of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ students and teachers in British schools , and the results have been published in an article written to help inventors of other games . A nationwide elimination contest with hundreds of entrants is now under way . The 50 finalists will face-off in London next month at the Magic Circle Theater.
