txt ABOARD THE CORAL REEF , Ba ? hamas ? " We were about 80 or 90 feet down , and we knelt on the ledge , " Dan Christopher recalled with awe . " We looked down , and it was all blue . It looked like it was blue forever . " After kneeling briefly on the ledge that separates the coral blue waters of the island from the icy valleys of the Atlantic , Christopher and another diver slowly paddled up under their own air bubbles to the nets and cages of their work . k However distracting the chasm of blue water , their Job was to capture exotic species of fish from these unbounded , semi-tropic waters to place them in gloss-lined tanks in a building off Lake Shore Drive . For nearly ? three weeks , Christopher and the other men aboard this ungainly yacht equipped with saltwater holding tanks . dove into the.shallows of San SalPhotos on back pg. , sec. 3 vador , one of the Bahama out-Islands , on an expedition to replenish the tanks of the Shedd Aquarium @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swam under the gaze of barracudas and occasional yellow stingrays to gather speckled moray eels , queen angelfish , bucktooth parrot fish , and a single porcupine puffer . " By coining ourselves there 's a better chance of getting exactly what we want , " sate William Braker , sipping a tin cupful of coffee on the bridge of the 76-foot research vessel Coral Reef . " People would quickly tire of looking at goldfish . We have to offer as diverse a selection of aquatic life as we can , " Braker , a slim , balding man who ft years worked his way around the holding tanks and administrative offices to become Shedd 's director , was aboard not to dive but to work out some of the man-made problems of this expedition and others like it . While he coordinated the shipment of the specimens through U.S. Customs and back to Chicago , he also dealt with recalcitrant locals , especially an assistant of the island 's owner who refused to allow the divers to take fish from the most fertile reefs . ALTHOUGH THE Bahamian govern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has for the last 43 years , the Shedd expedition depended on the islanders for gasoline and fresh water . Because the Island monopoly is a diving and underwater photography resort , the management did not want the Shedd boat within sight of their diving grounds . " It 's great to have a nearly virgin diving reef here , " argued Braker after a long and fruitless discussion with the island manager , " But how many people can afford to come here ? We 're trying to do the same thing display the beauty of the reef fish for a million people a year . We 're bringing to people what they ca n't see themselves . " The argument Is part of a wider issue that faces the world 's aquariums the // Sea show for Shedd divers // Shedd is the world 's largest indoors one and strikes at their very existence .

USING THE same arguments as those ' who philosophically oppose zoos for land creatures , they cite such problems that aptive fish do not reproduce well and their belief that such exposure is cruel : lind it shortens the normal lifespan of the fish . ; , Though the few hundred fish captured Column 1 Flaring this and other expeditiods of the Shedd boat this year are infinitesimal when compared with the billions left in ( he oceans , Braker and Don Zumwalt , he curator of fishes at Shedd , insist 4uch collecting is not only aesthetically , mportant for those who will never see tie underworld of the ocean but It is Indirectly rewarding to the entire ocean environment . ; , " Aquariums are a tool for studying marine creatures , " Braker contends .

Although there were no incidents this trip , the men wear knives in case of underwater attack . " The barracudas usually just circle , they 're curious , you know , " said Ryder .

" The milk case gives them some psychological security that they 're back in the reef , " said Zumwalt , who added that such false assurances are important to their survival on the trip to Chicago . To add to their serenity , a dozen triggerfish , whose skin is so rough sailors used to dry it and use it as a striking surface for matches , swam nearby . As the sun settled and the tank darkened , the only sign of life was the thin , almost fluorescent , blue line that runs down the eels ' bodies , like bright pencils curving through the water . It was almost as dark as beneath the ledge of the ocean . " Depending on the Hine of day , I get homesick , " said Ryder , whose thigh was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fan .
