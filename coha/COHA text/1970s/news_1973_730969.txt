txt Bobby Riggs kicked me off the tennis court today so he could play against two men for only $5 each , winner take all . He simply can not play for nothing  --  even when warming up for his $100,000 winner-takeall tennis match against Billie Jean King at the Astrodome tomorrow night . He kicked me off nicely  --  always the gentleman  --  complimenting my forehand volley  --  and asked me what I 'm doing here . " Rooting for Billie Jean , " I said cheerfully . " SHE 'S TOO G 0 0 D for me , " Riggs said , graciously ? for him . Close up , he surprises me . He does n't look bad . He suddenly has lost his pot belly ; for a guy 55 years old he 's in good shape . He only looks about 54 . His pockets are stuffed with cash he 's hustled today . I thought it was foreign currency the bills were so high . " Does he always carry that much money , " I asked Hans Wichary of San Diego @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said loyally ? all Riggs ' entourage is fiercely loyal ? " Remember what happened in Beverly Hills when that woman stole $1,800 from the pants he left in his bedroom ? " " OH , " I REPLIED , " I figtired she earned that ? " " Eighteen hundred , " Hans whistled , " he 's not that bad . " Still fiercely loyal . At a brief scurry , after a practice match , Billie Jean , surrounded by the press  --  she has given no exclusive interviews ? interviewed me . ? " How 's Gloria Steinem , " she asked me . " Fine , " I answer , " she 's sorry she ca n't be here . Not enough money . " Gloria says you 've thrown the gauntlet in , " I said . " I have , I sure have , " she says . And then she moves quickly out of the practice court , smiling , but not talking much to anyone . THE NEXT SET and Beautiful People , some of them indistinguishable from each other and often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Howard Cosell , Rod Steiger , Jimmy the Greek , Robert Stack , Jim Brown have come bearing tennis racquets . They will play in the Celebrity Tennis Tournament tomorrow before the match which will keep them indoors and out of trouble . The excitement of opening night mounts however , and the whole show is Bobby Riggs . King , of course , does not involve herself in this type of gamble . The big one comes tomorrow night . Riggs is at all the cocktail parties . And since Billie Jean is not , they turn out to be in his honor . He hands out cards to a party for him as if it were a personal invitation . saw these same cards of admission on a counter in the airport , however . He gives away Bobby buttons and banners , working every minute . OF COURSE , the Big Question is what will he wear tonight ? No one would dare ask Billie Jean such a superficial query . Bobby says , " I 'll be wearing something , ha , ho , unusual " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also in a shirt with a bright pink pig on it and a redundant slogan , Chauvinist . In this phony , hustling atmosphere he has to hustle even harder to get attention . The competition from his friends is enormous . " Did you put in the paper the odds I gave you the other day ? " Jimmy the Greek asked me . " Oh , yes I did , " I reply , " 5-to-2 favor Riggs . " Okay , " says Jimmy the Greek , smiling happily , " I have a new slant for you . They 're now 21/2 to one , " " Oh , " he 's changed it , " I say innocently . " No dear , " he says patiently . " Its the same thing . " Thanks Jimmy . Thanks Bobby . Thanks Beautiful People . Come , Billie Jean .
