 | A Shuttle-borne workshop for men and women scientists in orbit- Spacelab @# By this year 's end a working model of Spacelab , called the most important payload planned for our coming Space Shuttle , is due to be finished by the European Space Agency ( ESA ) ? complete with electrical , electronic , and other subsystems . Preceding work already gives a revealing preview of what the Spacelab , Western Europe 's $300-to-$400-million contribution to our future manned-space-flight program , will be like . Beginning in 1980 , when U.S. manned space missions will have resumed with the reusable Space Shuttle , made-in-Europe Spacelabs in its cargo bay will offer Americans and Europeans a golden opportunity for a week to a month of scientific research in orbit , with ideal equipment and in shirtsleeve comfort . You wo n't need to be a qualified astronaut to work in a Spacelab . There will still be astronauts in the Shuttle 's cockpit , to be sure . But the Shuttle 's comparatively gentle ride aloft and back ( only three g 's of force instead of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tist , engineer , or technician healthy enough to ride an airplane to join a Spacelab 's crew . Not an independent spacecraft , Spacelab will remain firmly attached to the cargo bay of a Shuttle Orbiter throughout a flight . Its crew will go aloft and return to earth as passengers in the Shuttle . In earth orbit at a height of about 400 kilometers ( 250 miles ) , the cargo-bay doors open , and the un- covered Spacelab will be ready for it crew to occupy and use . A Spacelab consists of one or both of two basic types of modules : ? A pressurized lab has a roomy inside diameter of about four meters ( 13 feet ) ; a typical two-segment one apparatus ( interchangeable to suit each mission ) , with working spaces left for tests . The lab will have windows at top and aft ; and an airlock and hatch for EVA ( extravehicular activity , popularly called spacewalking ) . ? A trough-shaped pallet or deck , made up of modules with a length of 2.9 meters ( 91/2 feet ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vacuum of space . Visible from the aft lab window , the pallet instruments can be controlled from the lab , the Shuttle , or remotely from earth ; and can be visited if necessary by EVA with the use of a spacesuit . Either the lab or the instrument pallet may be lengthened simply by adding duplicate modules , to meet different missions ' needs . Spacelab 's design can be further varied by omitting one of the two basic kinds of modules . Some  | Spacelab missions will have a pressurized lab only , which could take up most of the Shuttle cargo bay 's length . Other missions will have an extended instrument pallet , only . But the most favored Spacelab design in numbers , among 276 Spacelab missions anticipated in 1980-1991 , will be the attractively versatile lab-and-pallet combination ; and its West German builder is giving priority to this kind . A NASA-added tunnel enables a Spacelab crew to enter the lab from the Shuttle , and return to Shuttle living quarters for meals and for sleeping . Weightless in orbit , crew members will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from top to bottom of the lab . By way of a utilities duct from the Shuttle , Spacelab is provided with an earthlike cabin atmosphere , electric lighting and power for instruments , and an intercom link with the Shuttle . Who 's aboard Spacelab ? Spacelab crews will number from one to four members . For the first time they can be chosen solely for science talent , and regardless of sex . Many crews are expected to include women as well as men . For some missions , an all-female crew is a possibility . A team of four women aspirants recently spent five days at Marshall Space Flight Center , rehearsing a proposed series of 11 tests in materials science . Fashions for Spacelabbers may depart from the conventionalized symbols in the sketch below . Jumpsuit-type togs may prove more practical in zero gravity , both for men and women . Spacelab experiments will explore fields as varied as physics , astronomy , zero-gravity materials processing , life sciences , meteorology , earth-resources surveys , and monitoring air and water pollution . Unlike a passive probe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gear as high-voltage accelerators capable of making artificial auroras , and a high-power radio antenna 305 meters ( 1000 feet ) long , seen extending crosswise in view on preceding page . Better understanding of radio blackouts , and how solar radiation affects our weather , may result . An attack on a Van Allen radiation belt , with light gases released from canisters , will test if it can be temporarily dispersed . What amounts to a luxury space cruise for experimenters will end with the Shuttle 's smooth touchdown like a plane on a spaceport runway . Although a Spacelab crew will be non-astronauts , any expert help they might need will be no farther away than the opposite end of the Spacelab-Shuttle intercom . In the Shuttle crew will be a science astronaut called the Mission Specialist , who presumably will have thoroughly studied the script of their particular mission . He would be well qualified to don a spacesuit and do any astronaut-type chores for them such as EVA 's ? say , to reload photo film in a pallet instrument , or perform other routine tasks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " back porch . " In the Shuttle cockpit itself , the Mission Specialist could be expected to supervise special flight maneuvers for certain Spacelab missions ? say , to launch and recover a free-flying subsatellite aboard some Spacelabs , or sic to have the Shuttle flown updown to give an earth-resources : -n lion a downward-looking vie't . Bargain-cost space science Especially attractive to th --  ! taxpayers will be how much fur : , Spacelabs will make our space aI Lars go . Since all elements of Si:n Shuttles are reusable ( except empty propellant tank ) , they sh : cut the cost of transporting ; loads into low earth orbit to alp. 15 to 20 percent of the expense ' A today 's expendable multistage rc.0 ets PS , Nov.

Recurring opportunities I Spacelab flights will allow a mis. plagued by a key instrument 's rn behavior to be repeated once trouble is fixed . That contrasts wtih the present unforgiving situate where , as a wisecrack puts it . 99.9-percent-perfect space missile might be identical with a complete mission failure . " Finally , the Shuttle will put an end to costly naval operations fish returning space crews from sea ? that orchestrated pageant fast carriers , helicopters , and teal of skilled frogmen , dramatic h needlessly extravagant by come standards . The story behind Spacelab l that of the successful US-U. @#  | manned space mission last July ? is a happy one of international cooperation , with mutual benefits . Airborne astronomy , meteorolo. geophysics ; and earth-resource surveys had been carried on for s ears by NASA in a Learjet , a Convair 990 , and a Lockheed C-141 . Results convinced NASA that much could be gained , and much money saved , if the " lifestyle " of these irplane operations could be moved into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transportation . But still missing was an equally reusable and versatile multipurpose laboratory that would fit into the Shuttle Orbiter 's cavernous cargo bay ? 18.3 meters ( 60 feet ) long and 4.6 meters ( 15 feet ) in diameter . How Spacelab came about The year 1972 found NASA in the predicament that it had barely enough funds to develop the Space Shuttle itself , and not a dime to spare to spend on the desired lab . Luckily the time was opportune to invite Western Europe to assume the cost of developing the lab , and share the privilege of its use . The Europeans had long been eager for a more active role in space ? a proven " cutting edge " for scientific and technological protress . But ESA 's predecessor , the European Space Research Organization ( ESRO ) , was then having all kinds of problems with an ambitious project of its own ? to develop a large multi-stage launch rocket called Europa . Each rocket stage was the responsibility of a different country . Fitting together the pieces was taking an inordinate amount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Moreover , America 's coming reusable Space Shuttle threatened to make a " throwaway " rocket like Europa obsolete before it was completed , for peaceful space missions at least . ESRO made the wise and logical decision , all things considered , to revamp its priorities , and accepted NASA 's invitation to develop the lab for the Shuttle . As a beginning it coined the catchy name , Spacelab . Avoiding its Europa mistake of failing to provide strong central management , it would put one prime contractor in overall charge of developing the Spacelab . West Germany 's contribution of 54.1 percent of the program 's cost was by far the largest , and so , un-@#  | der the ground rules of most European multinational projects , the prime contractor would be a West German firm . After a spirited competition , the winning candidate was chosen in June 1974 : the VFWFokker/ERNO group in Bremen . Other participating companies work as subcontractors , regardless of nationality . Countries taking part in the venture include Belgium , Denmark , France , Germany , Italy , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Engins Matra of France is responsible for data acquisition , distribution and processing systems , and equipment such as telephones and closed-circuit television . Aeritalia of Italy is in charge of the module structure and thermal control . Hawker Siddeley Dynamics of England builds the pallet structures , while Kampsax of Denmark prepares computer software .

How it 's coming along @# The right-on-schedule progresdate shows the success of the ESR ESA plan of Spacelab-progr management .

Thus , a subsequent mission not need to be held up until Spacelab returning to earth is fitted with science gear for an tirely different purpose .
