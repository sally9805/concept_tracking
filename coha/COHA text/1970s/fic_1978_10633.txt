If only I could somehow miraculously discover a volume , hidden away in our house , I thought . When I got home she was asleep . I went to my room and it suddenly came to me . I would write a story for her . I knew the things she liked . Lots of description of a stately house , a bit isolated but with beautiful trees and gardens .

" Remedios Varo might have painted it , only there 's nothing sinister about these three at all . Imagine ! Three elegant old ladies having a midnight supper in full view of the world . It 's almost indecent , spying on them like this . " " Oh , they do n't care , " said Milo , with the facility for instantlydrawn characters that had made Arabella rich . " They are completely involved in themselves . We are only part of their backdrop , two figures in the darkness of the promenade to enhancetheir supper .

What a relief , now , to be shown into the narrow , monastic little guest room at the front of the house with its darkbluewalls and neat white bedspread turned back on fresh sheets with the creases from the laundry still in them . Everything so chaste and sane . I felt as if I 'd left the strife and confusion of the emotional life and gone on a spiritual retreat to Milo 's guest room .

" And your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place , too . " " Oh , can I look at it ? " I suddenly wanted to see it very much . " Of course . " His workroom was at the back of the house , overlooking the garden . He went in first and switched on an arc lamp . When I saw his desk I experienced my usual pang of jealousy for his assuredand organized creative life . The way everything waited for him there , his books , his jars of pencils , the pristine squared stack of student 's loose-leaf notebook paper , you had every confidence that within three or four months of steady , almost automatic , application on his part  --  looking down from time to timep104to admire whatever was growing or promising to grow in his garden ; looking up an architectural detail or a date in English historyin one of his reference books  --  another novel would emerge and duly be typed up and sent across the river and printed and bound between paper covers and placed in the racks to be eagerlyplucked out again by the multitudes of lonely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ romantic conclusion was still possible . And there on the white wall above his worktable was my painting , the illustration for The Secret of Seven Towers , matted in light gray and framed in thin silver . " God , did I paint that ? " It was truly a lovely painting . I could say it objectively , coming on it after three years . I could look at it as if a stranger had done it . It was drenched with an inner glowing . The forms were right . The colors were right . Everythingfor once had come together . " The only painting I ever sold , " I said wryly . " Except once , when I first came to New York , I sold a pen-and-ink drawing of a house . But I have to be honest . It was of our old house in Charlestonand I sold it to one of Ambrose 's girlfriends .

She sat erect upon a barely penciled-in settee , with a scroll-like back , her hands folded on her lap , lookingout very solemnly from a warm rose-brown interior . To her left , on another plane suggesting the outdoors at night , a man stands enfolded in the color that surrounds him , a deep bluegreen . He is looking toward her , but of course ca n't see her . She 's in another dimension . And yet there they are , within inches of each other . It made you feel good to look at them . You felt you knew more than they did , even about their own eventualhappiness . I had used watercolors because I had felt inspiredand was n't afraid of making a mistake .

" Look , " I had argued , " this way , when people finish reading the story , they can flip back to the cover and say , Hey , that could be me ! This story may have been set in nineteenth-century England , but it can still happen to the likes of me . ' " And Williamson had laughed and said , " Okay , you win .

" " Something like that . " " But wo n't that turn things around romantically ? The man will be passive and the woman will be the aggressor . I mean , if you have him coming to her house . " But then I added quickly , knowing how tender writers are about their projected works , " It sounds great . It 'll certainly be different . " " A change , " muttered Milo , turning off the lamp in the study , " a new balance , perhaps . " He walked me back to my room .

" " Why have you been having trouble sleeping , Milo ? " " Oh , it 's silly . Since that episode in Greece , you know , aboutp106the baby , I 've been having a recurring dream . I dread it so much I keep waking myself up before I have it . In it , I 'm delivering that baby again . I 'm trying to get a grip on his head , but it keeps going beneath the water . In the dream I 'm pulling him out of a body of water . The mother , a grotesquely fat woman , is standing beside me and somehow I understand that if I do succeed in bringing him out of the water she will kill us . So I 'm trying to get a grip on his head , at the same time wondering how I can run with him once I do get him out . . . if I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awful . And how unfair ! Because you succeeded in delivering him in real life ! That sounds a little like my math dream I had for years . I was always too late for a math exam , in dream after dream . And I 'd always cry and cry and wake up sweating . Then one night I got disgusted during the dream . I decided to go up to the teacher and say , Look , I missed the exam because I could n't find the right building . Will you let me make it up ? ' And she smiled and said , Of course ! ' and that was the end of that silly dream . Maybe you should turn around and ask your woman why she wants to kill you . " Milo laughed . " Violet , you 're incomparable . Perhaps I 'll do just that . " There was something so safe and schoolgirlish about lying in the dark at Milo 's house . With the clean-smelling sheet tucked chastely up to my chin , I felt I 'd shed all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ workroom had inspired me , the story about his mother had intrigued me : if only I had had some productive influence in my life . Some doting person demanding a new painting or drawing from me every day . You needed to believe someone was waiting for what you could do ; it spurred you on . The perverse thing was that I felt more spurred on right now than in months . I felt : If only this tragic thing had not occurred , if only I did n't have to take the eight a. m. bus to Plommet Falls in less than six hours , I would go home and paint like a demon as soon as it gets light . But would I have felt that way if the call had not come ? I would still bep107passed out cold in a stupor of vodka and despair , the radio by now popping static to my unconscious ears , the sound perhaps influencing some vile dream . Poor Milo ; I did n't envy him his dream . One 's days posed enough difficulties without having to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I tried to visualize Plommet Falls , the cabin where Ambrose had faced his dark realization . Then my thought veered back toward Milo 's workroom , everything set up for the work that would come next , and blessing the whole endeavor , on the wall above : my lovely painting . I had been struck with the mergence of the two planes , the close-valued rose-brown interior ( like the interior of a humanheart ) and the airier , diaphanous outdoor blue . There was something immensely satisfying about the union of those two planes . I wanted to paint something like that again . Like it , yet different . Another version . Seeing it had reactivated some emotionalimpetus I had not followed through . Then I dozed and woke again to footsteps and low voices passing beneath the open window . A man and a woman going home together in the early hours . Windows , I thought , still partly asleep . Other people 's lives through those windows . All these people moving through their blue dusks and dawns . And suddenly I was back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dusks and dawns ago , waiting for it to happen , waiting for my fate to begin shaping itself . I waited mostly for the phone to ring , for Ambrose to call and ask me out again , for the lady from Vogue to call and offer me a job , for some outside voice to explain to me what I was doingthere and where I was to go next . The evenings went by . I would hurry back from supper , usually at a little Japanese place next door to my hotel where I 'd eat early before the couples came , and sit on my bed ( there was no chair ) and wait for the call from the one person I knew in this city . Each evening the spring light lengthened just that bit more , and I would tell myself as long as there was any light in the sky there was still a chance he 'd call . While I waited , I took out my sketchbook , and with a particularly nice ballpoint pen I had at the time , evoked the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over light and shadow with loose and tight crosshatchings . I had the proverbial poor girl 's room that faced out over the air shaft , and I could see into the windows of other girls with similar rooms . There were lights on already in some of these rooms , but I strained my eyes in the bluish gloom because I was afraid to risk breaking the spell of my own shadows . These neighboring windows were like squares painted into the indigo of the spring dusk , squares containing the secrets of other people 's lives . Girls lived there , girls like myself , who were biding their time in rooms that cramped their style till they could become something better . I saw a set of bikini panties and bra , in a leopard-skin print , drying on an octagonal wooden clothesline ; a window full of paperback books ; a windowsillthat looked like a cosmetics counter . In one window , catty-cornered to mine and a floor above , a green portable radio pealed out a sound bravely disproportionate to its small size and filled our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , one that had a significance for me . Still debating the merits of perilous freedom versus stifling security , I had contemplated its temptinglyrics over the last few months whenever I 'd heard them . It was called " Downtown " ; perhaps you remember it , too . Suddenly , on one of these blue evenings , a head of the most amazing hair began unfurling itself from this window . It was a rippling , wavy blond , the exact color and texture of a fairy princess 's . Its owner was apparently hanging it out to dry . But it kept coming ! It must have been down to her waist , or longer . She bent deeply forward until the hair finally reached the window directly below . " Mary Anne ! " called a muffled voice under the hair . " Mary A-anne ! " " Yeah ? " replied a burly voice . " Are ya usingyour big rollers ? " called the hair . " Nah , ya want ' em ? Wait a sec . I 'll send ' em up . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a clear plastic bag filled with pink metal rollers , deftly knotted a strand of her upstairs neighbor 's wet hair around the hag , and tugged twice . " Thanks ! " called the muffled voice , and the hair , bearing the attached cargo , was borne upward and withdrawn into the window above.  |p109And  I had put down my pen and my pad , enchanted by what I had seen . Reality had outstripped my ability to render it . For how could I possibly convey , through mere shape or line , all that this scene meant to me ? But now , looking across the space of nine years at that evening , I understood its essence . There I had crouched in the shadows of my own potential . I had my feelings and I had my materials , but I did n't know how to make one work for the other . There I sat , waiting for something to happen , for the phone to ring , for help to come from outside . That something was happeninginside , I never considered . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tonal values being locked away in my visual memory which could later be opened by the right combination of accumulated experience , I never dreamed . And if I had been told , I would have replied impatiently , " But I want something tonight ! " Now I saw the painting that might come out of all this . It would come out of that evening , but balanced by this one . " Violetin Blue " was how I thought of it . Of course , it would n't have windows filled with books or lipsticks or panties hanging out to dry . It would n't even have that marvelous Rapunzel moment when she let down her hair and brought up not the prince , but curlers to get the prince . All the outward indications of the theme , which had served to keep the memory full of energy for me , would be effaced . The literalness of the experience would be translated into paint . So , though I might know that " Violet " had originally stood for me ( and for all those lives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ongoing blue ) , the painting would have only the color violet , costumed in many tones , a color sometimes greedy with impasto , trying to steal center stage with the violence of its caked force ; at other times flattened to near extinction by the equanimity of the blue ; and  --  at a spot where the eye would want to return again  --  achieving finally a lovers ' merger , so that blue is deepened by violet 's shadow and her imprint is left on the long night of his memory . The painting 's challenge would be how well I could capturep110that state of precariousness , how well I could evoke , through paint , choices hanging in the balance , the way different thicknesses ( like different individuals ) strove to impose their color against all that would go on anyway . That their color was a reflection , a variation , an emanation of my own had come to me only in the course of this evening . Had not Ambrose 's act in some way been an echo of my own darkest wishes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between living and dying , betweendoing what we wanted and needed to do and not doing it ? Some of us drifted fairly steadily along the elected path , like Milo ; others went looking , like myself , for the easy miracle route ; and those like Ambrose . . . fell prey to the charming detour ? Confused the detour with the next leg of the journey ? " Boy , if I have n't gone and made a mess , " he 'd said . It was the night he 'd left Carol , the first and only time in my New York life when he 'd dropped in on me unannounced . ( For decency 's sake , should n't I call Carol and let her know ? I honestly had not thought of her till this moment , the woman Ambrose had suddenlymarried soon after I came to New York  --  and just as suddenlyleft , a little over a year later . Would she want to know ? What would it be to her now , that the man who had caused her so much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But what 's happened ? " It was very late . His knocking had waked me up .

I could put some ice in it . " It was a hot September night . I had not even known they were fighting . " That sounds wonderful , thank you . " And there we 'd sat , Ambrose sipping his Drambuie and ice , and me trying to squeeze in the pertinent question , to find out what had happened . " Well , let 's see what I can salvage from my mess , " he said.  | " I 'll go to Mexico for the divorce . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then she can marry a man worthy of her . I have in mind a little plan , to sort of tie in with my book . I 've been checking through Connie Ryan 's book on D-day . It has a list of all the men in the foist who took part in the liberation . You know what I 've been thinking of doing ? Looking up these men , finding out what they 're doing today , how they 've adjusted to civilian life , how they feel about this war we 're in now . I could use it as an episode in my novel  --  you know , the hero looks up some of his old buddies twenty years later  --  and , I was thinking , I could also publish it as a separate piece of reportage . I was speaking to a friend of mine this afternoon , he 's an editor over at the Saturday Evening Post . He says he can get me an advance for my travel expenses .

" Somethinglike that , " he said . " Oh . Would you like me to fix you some eggs ? An omelet ? I could make us a bacon omelet . " " Great idea , sport ! I 'm feeling more positive already .

"  |p112I  really did not feel justified in telephoning Carol at six-thirty in the morning to give her such unhappy news . So while Milo perked our coffee ( he was pale and shaky this morning despite his insistence that he 'd slept a dreamless sleep ) and set out enough cereals and fruit and wheat germ to turn me into a superwoman , I looked up C. M. Gruber , still at Central Park West , in the phone book , and made a note of the number . I decided to call her from the Port Authority Terminal just before I boarded my bus . This was sheer cowardice on my part . I did n't want to talk any longer than necessary . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just that the mere thought of her had made me feel guilty ever since their breakup .

She and I had endured ( at her invitation ) one painfulpost-divorce luncheon at Schrafft 's , where she had insisted she wanted to remain my friend and given me a little lecture on the importance of Drive . " Next time , you call me , " she had said . I kept meaning to and putting it off .

I found the Adirondack Trailways counter , bought my ticket and asked the gate number .

" Okay , Violet , get it over with , " I said . She answered , sounding rather cheerful . " Hello , Carol , it 's Violet here . Violet Clay . " There was a silence . Then ( with a tad too much heartiness ? ) : " I have n't forgotten you , Violet . How nice to hear from you again . What have you been up to ? " " Oh , nothing . Pretty much the same .

Where are you calling from ? " " From the bus station . Actually , I have to hang up in a minute . He was living in a place called Plommet Falls . I 'm on my way up there now . It 's in the Adirondacks . He 'd been living in a cabin up there , ever since he came back from Mexico this past spring . " " In a cabin ? " " Yes . He went up there to finish his novel .

I 've called a meeting of the board of directors for ten , at the Newark factory , but we could go together to the Adirondacks . . . my chauffeur could drive us . We could leave around noon . Why do n't you cash in your ticket and come on over here and we 'll go together .

It always had that funny knobbly place .. .. " I thought I heard her voice break . " Carol , I feel like a heel , but I have to hang up . Listen , I 'll call you from up there and tell you what I find out . " " Will you call today ? I 'll be home by midafternoon at the latest .

He enjoyed being in that . In fact , I think I have the old program somewhere . He was on a committee . " By the time I finally managed to hang up , I had to race downstairs to my gate . Dear Carol ; the Times was her arbiter of reality . If it was n't in the Times it did n't count . There was a line of people waiting to board the bus , many of them young , wearing heavy boots and orange backpacks . What if I did n't get on ? But the driver took my ticket and I did . I was afraid I would n't get a seat by the window , but I did . I froze myself in an aloof position and hoped nobody would sit next to me . Nobody did . Then I wondered why they had n't . Across the aisle , a boy and a girl took off their backpacks and settledthemselves in . They were very beautiful and seemed almost replicas of each other . They both had long shining blond hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I remembered how surprised I had been in my first life drawing class when the teacher told us that the male and femaleskeletons had exactly the same sets of bones , the same number of bones , and the same kinds of bones . What had I been expecting  --  Adam 's rib in the female ? Or a penis bone in the man , like the one in my uncle 's old joke about the duchess ? But if our teacher had shown me these two across the aisle , I would have been less surprised . There was not much of a male-female dividing line in their structures . Were the structures of male-femalerelationships changing as well ? I could n't , for instance , see this lanky girl waiting at home by the telephone for her boy . She 'd pull her Levi 's up over those long bones and lace up her boots and stalk out into the night and find him . And if she did n't find him she 'd probably go on walking . Today they 'd clamber up the side of a mountain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , after a supper from cans , in identical sleepingbags under the August moon . And then ? Would one of them shift his skeletal frame through the moonlight to the other 's sleeping bag ? Which one would come to the other ? Or did n't those things matter anymore ? And once together , would they shed this deceptive look-alikeness and plunge into the old ,  |p116time-honored  mysteries of the flesh ? Or was mystery between the sexes as old hat now as sleeping on either side of a sword ? I watched these two as the bus sped through an ugly industrialsection on the other side of the tunnel . The boy had put his knees up against the back of the seat in front of him , scrunched serenely down on his spine , and was either sleeping or preparing to sleep . The girl had taken a paperback book out of her knapsack and seemed to be gazing at the print rather than reading it . It looked like science fiction , with a cover depicting a rather cartoony tropical paradise . I wondered if she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the silly old plots on which my emotions and expectations had been weaned ? What would it be like , I wondered , to have been born this girl instead of myself ? Somehow , in spite of all my travails , I decided it would be less interesting . She was all light and surface ; there was n't any chiaroscuro . No signs of low simmering anguish or volatile desires . Or perhaps I was being unfair . Give her ten more years ; she 'd grow some shadows . But even the shadows would be a differentgeneration from mine . I doubted , for instance , that she worried about being an old maid . Did some unrealized ambition smolder in her breast like chronic heartburn ? Maybe so , maybe so . I could n't see any signs of it threatening to ruin today for her , however . I looked out the window and noticed , for the first time in weeks , that the world still had a sky , a very light , cloudless Prussian-blueone , give or take the bottom mile or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ river resumed the manageable proportions of a maquette , a harmless little table model on which I could project my dreams . It had looked like this when I rode the Carey bus into its center nine years ago from Newark . I still felt the old twinge when I looked at it now . I still wanted to leave my mark on it , even though it had left so many marks on me . Just learning to survive , those first months , had been exciting . I 'd had several immediate small victories , mitigated , I 'll ad/mit , by what came after , but quite exhilarating in their own hour . I 'd found a job doing sketches , a beautiful older-sister sponsor who took me under her wing . I 'd even had the perfect apartment , the one I secretly wanted , dropped into my lap rent-free . My uncle , as I have already mentioned , promised to put in a good word for me with the " nice lady " he knew over at Vogue , to help me find an art-related @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reputation as a painter . Well , after our evening together , his and mine , about a week went by during which nothing happened and nobody called . I almost picked up the phone to call him several times , but I did n't want him ever to feel Little Niece Violet might become a drag on his bachelor life . I restrainedmyself . I haunted the Museum of Modern Art by day ( it was much less painful to confront the Safely Famous , many already old or dead , than it was to return to the scene of my early defeat and gaze on the works of my luckier peers ) and sketched and brooded by night on my bed at the Martha Washington . When the phone did ring around nine o'clock one evening , I had become so used to the silence that I almost jumped out of my skin . A very friendly-sounding woman introduced herself as Sheila Benton . " I 'm health and beauty editor over at Vogue . Also a very close friend of your uncle 's . I was wondering were you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Wonderful . I 'll take you to this little French place I 'm fond of . Will you , by any chance , be seeing Ambrose before to-morrow ? " " I do n't plan to . Did you have a message for him ? " " No , not really . Nothing special at all . Well , then ... " She told me how to get to her office . " Around noon ? And be sure and bring your portfolio . Particularly any little pen-and-ink drawings . I really must run along now . A tout a l'heure ! " The next morning I went through my Anne Fogarty , good pearls and Chant d'Aromes ritual , the same as a week before , only this time , thank goodness , I did n't have the curse . I arrivedp118at the Conde Nast building fifteen minutes too soon and lurked downstairs at a newsstand , gazing with some disbelief at the glossy perfection of the women on the magazine covers and then furtively comparing my reflection in a long glass case full of cigars . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect with a smile , and rode up on the elevatorto Miss Benton 's floor , imagining that I already worked here . I could n't help staring when she came out to the reception room to meet me . Could anybody not pressed into the deceptive two dimensions of a magazine cover actually look so perfect in the flesh ? What a face . What a shape . And her whole person was clipped and colored , scented and coordinated to such a pitch of grooming that I became uncomfortable , for the first time since I 'd shed Pequena Bombal 's influence , about my unpainted nails , unprofessionally coiffed hair , and last spring 's hemline . Miss Benton , however , seemed delighted with me . " What a petite thing you are ! You 've got Ambrose Clay 's raven-black hair . Also , you know , you resemble him around the cheeks and nostrils a little . Wo n't you come this way ? I 'll show you my little cubbyhole . " She led me down a hall , setting a jaunty , swinging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silk blouse rustling , the little gold chains around her neck and wrists ringinglike tiny sleighbells . Behind desks in the cubicles we passed , women sat framed by open doorways as if on display . Even the older ones looked as though they 'd been up all night with a makeup man , getting ready to come to work . " Here we are ! " sang Miss Benton . " Why do n't we sit down and see what you 've brought me first . " She made a good-naturedattempt to clear a part of her desk , which was crammed with sample bottles of liquid makeup , packages of cold-water soap , tubes of hair conditioners and suntan lotions , false eyelashes , night creams and so on . Her nails were painted the exactshade of her blouse , and as she bent to tidy up , I got a glimpse of beige lace ornamenting a generous bosom . Her hair , a burnished red-gold , she wore in a sort of warrior 's helmet haircut.  |p119Together  we looked at my drawings . Whereas the week before I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my gallery critics , Miss Benton 's reaction seemed to come a little too quickly . She pronounced my nudes in conte crayon " charming , " my watercolor " Studies for Three Graces " " comme it faut , " my lithographs of the Dark Angels ( minus the one I had lost to biology ) " deliciously spooky , " and when she saw the little sketches I 'd been doing from my window in the evenings at the Martha Washington , she seized on them at once . " Now , this is the kind of thing .. . " She held up the one of a window sill crammed with cosmetics . " And I can tell from the nudes that you 'd be able to do little drawings of women doing exercises . Just line drawings , you know . Oh , what is this lovely old house with the iron gate and the piazzas ? " " That 's just a pen-and-wash thing I did several summers ago . It 's our old house in Charleston . It 's been sold now . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he grew up ? " The bosom heaved under the magenta silk blouse . I was beginning to put two and two together . Still , a job was a job . We walked to the French restaurant , as it was a nice day . I saw men turn their heads as Sheila ( as I had now been ordered to call her ) swung briskly along in her career girl 's stride , bright hair bouncing , gold chains jingling . " I 'm pretty sure I can get you seventy-five a week for a start , " she said . " You 'd legally be my assistant  --  the editor 's promised me one for ages  --  but I see no reason why we could n't run some little drawings as part of my column . The art department is run separately , you see , but this way you and I can work closer together . You 'd help me researchmy column as well . Would you mind that ? Jobs are hard to find here . And of course , this would only be a faute de @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world . " Over our lunch in a tiny basement slightly larger than her office , attended by three waiters with whom she took every opportunityof exchanging French phrases , we discussed wiiat I would do for her . " I 've already had one idea , " she said , daintily prying loose an artichoke leaf with her magenta nails . " I 'll sendp120you over to Michel on Fifty-seventh . He 's my hair stylist . A real wizard with hair . He 'd do wonders with your thick black mane . Not that it is n't nice now . But he could bring out its natural weightiness with a little shaping . And you could do sketches . Before and after , you know . I 'd call the column something like Bringing Out Your Hair 's Natural Shape . ' The natural look is the thing these days . All that teasing damages your hair , you know . " I agreed there was no reason why I could n't begin work the very next day . When we parted at the entrance of the Conde Nast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm so pleased about this , Violet . Do say hello to Ambrose . Will you be seeing him later ? " " Not today , " I hedged , not wanting to admit I 'd seen him only once since I 'd been in town . " Well , " she said , with a cheery little lilt , " if you see him before I do , tell him Sheila sends her best ! " I said I would , noticing , as we waved goodbye , how soft her silver-blue eyes were . They were the least voguish part about her , limpid and trusting , rather like a blue-eyed dog 's eyes . That night , I felt I had a good excuse to call Ambrose , to tell him I had got the job and thank him . He answered his phone in that same reserved way I 'd noticed the first time I called him , as if he was n't sure he wanted to talk to the person at the other end . But he warmed up when he heard my voice and said he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  it must be telepathy . " Truth is , " he said , " I 've got a little proposition for you . How would you like to apartment-sit at Two hundred Waverlyfor the next three weeks or so ? " " Are you serious ! " " Sure I am . I 'm off to Italy on an assignment for Holiday magazine in a couple of days . Why should you waste your good money on the Martha Washington when you could spread out at my place ? Besides , I need someone to water my begonias . " " Boy , this is my day , " I said . I told him about the job . " I owe it all to you . I have a strong feeling it was your friendshipp121with Sheila Benton more than my artwork that got it for me . " I put just a touch of insinuation in my voice in case he wanted to respond to it . He did n't . " Sheila 's a real fine girl , " he said , " but you are a finer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two in touch . Now listen , tell you what . My super 's name is Finney . I 'll leave the key with him , and then when you get ready to come over , just ring his bell . He lives on the ground floor . " " But are n't I going to see you before you go ? " " ' Fraid not , honey . I 'm going to be running all over the place these next two days . And I 've got to get my smallpox booster and do research at the library . " " For the novel ? " " No , no , for my Holiday piece . It 's going to be called The Writer 's Italy . ' I ca n't imagine why nobody 's thought of it before . This editor I proposed it to got real excited . Violet , stop and think . How many writers can you think of to whom Italy has been important ? " " Well , Dante ... or do you mean writers of other nationalitiesas well ? " " Sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Shelley and Forster and Lawrence and James and Mann . And Mrs. Wharton . . . The list is endless . What I 'm going to do is talk about the writers and their characters in Italy . You know , Von Aschenbach in Venice , not just Mann . " " And Isabel Archer got proposed to in Rome , " I reminded him . " Hey , that 's right . You ought to be going with me . You 'd be a real asset . " " I 'd love to . But starting tomorrow , I 'm a working girl . By the way , Sheila said for me to tell you hello if I saw you before she did . So I guess this will have to do , since I wo n't see you for a few weeks . " " I guess it will , " he said , not too enthusiastically . We talked a few more minutes and made arrangements for me to take up residence at Waverly Place in three days.  |p122Thus  began my Euphoric Era in New York , short-lived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or the illusion of it  --  rode uptownon the subway every morning to my job . It went with me over to Fifty-seventh , where Michel the Wizard Hair Stylist tilted his tight-trousered pelvis against the side of my chair and snipped and set and combed while I rapidly sketched out of existencethe old un-chic Violet and redrew her as a svelte duplicate-in-miniatureof her new boss , with the same warrior 's helmethair style . It followed me " home " after work , to my uncle 's lived-in lair , where I overwatered his begonias , played his records , and snooped a little . On the nights I did n't eat with Sheila , I made entries into a new hardbound sketchbook I had bought : one day if I became famous , these notebooks ( I had in mind the diaries of Paul Klee ) would be of inestimable value to art scholars . The verbal entries I therefore made in ink ; and whenever a pencil sketch turned out particularly well ( " Self-Portrait Sketching in Bed , " for instance ) , I must admit I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dulled by habit and routine , struck out in all directions . I had in mind dozens of projects  --  which would all have to wait , of course , until I had saved a bit of money and moved into a place of my own . My spirits were so high that I could even look back on the Gallery Fiasco Day as an important spiritual lesson for me , and  --  after I had made my name  --  a story both touching and encouraging to other young artists coming up . To preserve the memory before it faded , I jotted down the impressionistic details of the day and illustrated them with small drawings : the lady in the red hat , old Mr. Green standing in awe before several giant-sized burdocks and a few violets growing out of the gallery 's floor . The Frank Stella imitations on the walls . I colored my burdocks and violets with inks , but left the paintings on the wall black and white . Historywould appreciate this ironic touch of prediction . I even managed a cartoon of distraught Violet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her first humiliation . Sheila and I at her initiative had become intimates immediately . She was only six years older than I. The only daughterp123of a Dallas dermatologist , she 'd come east to attend Miss Finch 's . During her second year there , her mother had died suddenly . She 'd gone back to school briefly , then dropped out . After that she 'd lived in Paris for a year with a rich aunt . She 'd come back to New York set on becoming a high-fashion model , but both Powers and Ford had told her she was too well endowedup top . She got a " faute de mieux job " at B. Altman 's , after which she went to Vogue as an assistant to the fashion assignmentscoordinator . " And then one day the magazine was doinga special section on skin care and I called Daddy on the WATS line to ask him a few things , and ended up writing most of the copy , which everybody liked , and . . . here I am ! " But where she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she intended to be for long . I had begun to suspect where her real ambitions lay the first day we met ; I suspected a bit more when she insisted on buying my pen-and-wash drawing of the house on the Battery and paying too much for it even after I had pointed out a critical flaw in perspective between the secondfloorsouth piazza and Ambrose 's old room to the north ; but the truth had really hit home that first evening I went to her apartmentfor supper . As soon as we were inside , she gave me a drink ( in those days , I still preferred a Coke ) and told me to look around if I liked while she cut up things for our salad . I browsed about her modish living-dining area , furnished more appropriatelyfor a southwestern climate , with glass tabletops and bamboo furniture and bright floral prints . There were lots of mirrors ( well , why not , in Sheila 's case ? ) and some hard-edged pastel canvases that had probably been bought because they matched the curtains . There were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ current fashion magazines on a display rack at the end of her wall shelves . I did notice a sumptuous new volumeon Italy on her coffee table . " Do you mind if I use your bathroom ? " I called . " It 's through the bedroom ! " she called back . A thrilling tension went through the entire apartment as I crossed the threshold of that bedroom . There , across from the king-sized bed covered in a quilted rust satin , above an enor/mous kidney-shaped dressing table with more perfume bottles than I had ever seen , all around and above the three-way mirror , were at least a hundred pictures of Ambrose : Ambrose from all angles and in various dimensions , Ambrose in sharp-focused black-and-white , in grainy gray , in all his colors ; Ambrose wearingtennis clothes , Ambrose in a raincoat looking like a cheerful spy , Ambrose with his arm around a Sheila with a different hairdo , Ambrose in a bathing suit with his back to the camera , about to venture into the sea . A surfeit of Ambroses . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schoolgirl dresser was but a chaste prelude to this exhibition . I picked up a bottle of Bellodgia and abstractedly oversprayed myself . The exhibitionhad been mounted as a sort of collage mural . Whoever had done it had a good eye for balance and design . There was one Ambrose , wearing a tux and black tie , blown up even larger than life size  --  probably someone on the Vogue photography staff had obliged her . I think I completely forgot to use the bathroom . When I went into the kitchen , Sheila stood shredding a carrot . She looked up and met my look . " Well , ma petite soeur , now you know , " she said , blushing happily . As we sat at her round glass table eating our chef 's salads , she inquired with friendly interest about my life and my plans for the future . I gave her a portfolio sampling , mostly cartoons because I was in a good mood , of my travails as a boarding school orphan , my summer in stifling Charleston with Granny , my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over again and make my name as an artist . Whenever my history touched in any way on Ambrose 's , she became raptly attentive . " Did he come often to your school , then ? What was his life like during those years when he was in Hollywood , doing that ill-fated screenplay ? So many writers have had bad luck with Hollywood , have n't they ! It 's interesting , though , that he never married . Did you meet any of his girlfriends in those days ? Of course , that 's long ago , that 's the past , " and she laughed . " I would have been in grammar school . When Ambrose was my present age , I was eleven ! I 'm twenty-nine now . You 're fortunate to be onlyp125twenty-three . Twenty-three and you 've already been married . Nobody can ever call you an old maid . " She sighed and put down her fork . After supper , we curled up on the couch together and she brought out a scrapbook . In the scrapbook were articles , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clipped and inserted between transparent sheets of plastic . They were articles on food , drink and travel , and an occasional movie review . They were all signed A. Valentine . " His nom de plume , " she said . I pretended to know . I scanned a few articles . Some of them were only a couple of paragraphs . A. Valentine wrote a stiff , understated , condescending prose . There was no sign of Ambrose 's rangy , enthusiastic , hyperbolic speaking style . A. Valentine had never been a boy from down home . He seemed to have been drinking and dining and going through customs since the beginning of the world . I noticed foreign phrases scattered wearily through his low-keyed praise of newly opened bars and restaurants . I was a little disappointed at him , who cared so much about getting his " one true sentence " a day . Why waste words on these things ? Money , of course . The dear old till . I , too , was now indentured to the till . Why else would I spend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I resolved hereafterto create technical challenges for myself . Starting tomorrow , I would draw every bottle and beauty aid upside down . " Of course , for this big Holiday piece , " said Sheila , " he 'll no doubt use his own name . That 's the kind of piece that can bolster his reputation . He keeps the two separate , you know . The fluff and the real stuff , as he puts it . " " Oh , do you have any of his real stuff , then ? I have n't kept up as well as I should with what he 's been doing . " " Well , " she mused , turning the pages of the scrapbook but not finding anything representative of this higher category , " just now he 's putting his best efforts into the new novel . Which is as it should be , do n't you agree ? " I agreed . " Have you read much of it ? " " He read some of it to me once . It was just after we startedp126going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he read this really touching scene  --  I 'm pretty sure he said it was a chapter from his new novel . It was that scene where the lonely little boy is wandering around the big house trying to amuse himself and invents this sinister man who leads him upstairs to where his mother is making love with a stranger . You know that one ? " " I think I remember it , " I bluffed , wanting to learn more yet keep her from knowing how little I knew . " But I ca n't recall .. . Who was the stranger ? That part seems to have faded . " " Oh ! I was hoping you could fill me in on these details , Violet . Did your grandmother have some lover , perhaps ? " " Not that I know of . " " But of course she would n't have told you , would she ? The Clay family is so full of mysteries ! All so convoluted in that typicallySouthern way . The first book was based on your mother , he told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've even thought I owed a debt to her at times . " " A debt to my mother ? " " Yes . For keeping him so charmed by her memory that he did n't marry all those years . But I have to say , Violet , that there are times . . . well , when I have had reason to think that his allegiance  --  sacredas it has been  --  shows signs of fading . Do you mind that I 've said that ? " " No , I do n't mind . " " And you would n't mind if ... " The faithful-dog eyes entreatedme with all the fullness of their limpid blue appeal . " Of course I would n't , " I said . She threw her arms around my neck and kissed me and called me her petite soeur , which , till the end of our relationship , became her pet name for me . After Ambrose had been gone about two weeks , we each received a postcard . Sheila 's showed a detail from Botticelli 's " Birth of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sheila 's . I greatly appreciate your kindness to Violet , said the message , and am sure she 'll prove herself a real asset . The weather so farp127has been beautiful . Will leave for Rome tomorrow . Affectionately , " A. V. " My card had a self-portrait of Hans Holbein the Younger . Have just spent an enriching morning at the Uffizi . Kept wishing you could see these great paintings . Well , when our ships come in ! Look at Holbein 's searching eyes , the real artistready at any minute to pounce on his truth . Love , Ambrose . I was a little surprised that he had n't signed Sheila 's card " love , " as well . But she seemed quite pleased that he 'd sent her a card at all , which I thought strange , considering how things stood between them . And then , that evening or the next , when she and I were curled up on her sofa looking through her glossy picture book of Italy , sort of tracing his journey , she told me she 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Holiday assignment . " I took this to mean he had n't told her and I thought that strange , too . The Saturday following this , I was just heading out into a lovely morning , on my way to spend as much as I could of my pay check at a fabulous art supply store I 'd just discovered . All the artists in the Village shopped there and I got a great competitivestimulus from watching to see what papers and brushes and colors they chose . There was mail in Ambrose 's box and I debated whether to look at it now or to wait till I came back so I would n't have to carry it around in my purse . My innate curiositywon , of course . Along with what looked like a bill from Mark Cross and a reminder that his subscription to Playboy was about to run out was an airmail letter for me from the American Embassyin Rome . It was from Ambrose . I read the first sentence in his ceremonious , free-flowing hand beneath the imposing seal . I stopped walking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his building and read the whole letter . Violet honey , Your decrepit old uncle was married here at the consul 's office about fifteen minutes ago . This p.m. we leave Rome for Siena , where we 'll be staying probably through the most part of the summer . Things happened pretty fast but then miracles generally do.  |p128Carol  believes in the things we do . She says tell you she plans to write you a long letter soon . I am a lucky man and a thankful man . For the first time in years , I feel I 'm dealing with a full deck . Hope you 're finding the apartment congenial . I may be asking you to send me a few things , my lightweight suit and some more shirts . The coleus ( with the fringy leaves ) will need to be watered more than the Wandering Jew , and the begonias must n't have direct sun . Do n't worry about rent , I 'll take care of it through my bank . Now 's your chance to get on your feet . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wait and see . Tuo zio the box and pretend it had not arrivedtill Monday . I was having supper at Sheila 's , and one reasonI had so looked forward to this day by myself was that I knew I had somewhere to go at the end of it . How could I go and eat her food now ? But on the other hand , I reasoned , surely he must have sent her a letter , too . She would want to talk about it . She might even be telephoning me upstairs right now . Should I go back up ? But the sun was so warm and the day so lovely . PerhapsI should get on a subway and go uptown to her immediately , get it over with . But if she had n't received the news , I 'd just succeed in blackening this nice spring day for her . Yet at the same time my thoughts raced frantically back and forth on Sheila 's behalf , another part of my mind had set up its own counterpoint of jubilation . I could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for him , and I could stay on in his wonderfulapartment and paint . Really get my feet on the ground . I already envisioned a roomful of new paintings by the fall .. . a second , triumphant trip up to the galleries . Or maybe this time the gallery owners would come downtown to me . But I would need to keep my job as Sheila 's assistant , in orderto provide myself with food and the other daily necessities . By this time I had reached Washington Square . Still debatingwhether to call Sheila , or go on through the day as planned and simply show up at her place at six and let nature take itsp129course , I walked block after block up Fifth till I found myself at the Forty-second Street library . I felt I could more easily walk to Montreal than face Sheila . Then " Jesu , Joy of Man 's Desiring " pealed through the spring air like a nudge from God toward my charitable impulses . A black man playing the xylophone had gathered a large crowd around him on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hat , thinking of charity versus tinkling brass , and decisively crossed the street and headed east toward Sheila 's . I stopped to buy a bunch of jonquils at the outdoor marketacross the street from her building . Do unto others , I thought , and if I were in Sheila 's shoes I would want to know where I stood immediately so I could make other plans before grass grew under my feet . She was surprised when I announced myself on the intercom at half past eleven in the morning . " May I come up for a minute ? I was just passing , " I said like an idiot . Starting off on the wrong tack already . " Violet ! I 'm not even dressed yet . Sure , come on . " The door buzzed . I went up to her floor . She was waiting happily in her open door , in an orange kimono . Without her makeup , she looked like a scrubbed schoolgirl . I felt a dark flash of hatred for the stranger Carol . " What a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 've brought me flowers . I 'm glad you stopped by . " She hustled me in . " I 'll make us some tea . . . or would you rather have coffee ? " " I 'm not sure you 'll want to have me , " I said , sinking down on the sofa where we had so recently sat with our feet up , looking through " A.V. " ' s scrapbbook . " I 've just had the strangest letter from Ambrose . . . . I feel perfectly terrible . " " Why ? What ? " She sat down beside me . The shining look went out of her face . " Well . . . shit . It seems he 's gotten married . " " That 's impossible , " said Sheila . " If he ever marries , he 's goingto marry me . You 're lying . " " No , I 'm not . I wish I were . " I held up my hands in a gesture of impotence . Sheila was looking at me as though I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hospitable room . Well , I had . " What did the letter say ? Do you have it ? Let me see . " " Sheila , I 'm not sure you ought to see it . I mean ... " " Oh , come off it , Violet . Let me see that letter . That is , if this is n't some joke of yours . " I handed over the letter , feeling wounded . Sheila was not respondingvery decently to my charitable impulse . I examined the hard-edged paintings that I did n't like while she read Ambrose'sletter . She took a long time reading it . Perhaps she read it several times . " Je suis foutu , " she whispered savagely at last . " I 'm sorry , " I said . " I was just as unprepared for this as you were . " " I would n't go so far as to say that . " She was looking at me so coldly I felt shivery . The jonquils lay in their paper on the glass-topped table , where I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman ? Did you know he 'd been seeing her ? " " I never even heard her name till I opened this letter . He met her over there , from the sound of the letter . " " No , he 'd been seeing her here , behind my back . He took her to Italy . This was all planned out . " " Well , then , " I said , wondering how soon I could leave , " you know more about her than I do . I was n't even sure she was American . " " Let me see that letter again , " she said , snatching it back . She read through it once more , moving her lips . " Tuo zio fortunato. . . pretentious bastard . Good for everybody , ' eh ? I 'd like somebody to tell me how it will be good for me . " " Well , " I said , " is n't there some good in knowing the truth ? Then you can proceed from there . " " The point is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an acid inflectionon my pet name , " I do n't want to proceed anywhere . So what are we going to do about that ? " She folded her arms and stood up , looking down on me , as if this were just some nonsensicaljoke that I could set right anytime I chose . I , too , stood up . " I think I ought to go . It ca n't be pleasant for you , having me here . " I could n't wait to get out of there.  | " I 've got to think , " muttered Sheila , pacing up and down with her kimono trailing majestically behind her . She wrung her hands mechanically , going back and forth in front of me . " Just let me think . " " I 'll call you later , " I said , letting myself out . She was still pacing and did not answer me . Made braver by the real trouble of someone else , I decided to experiment with the New York subway system and discovered the E train , which got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bought a hot dog from a vendor and ate it sitting on the rim of the fountain in Washington Square , trying to imagine who Carol was and what she would turn out to be like . I reread the letter , searching for clues . She " believes in the things we do " must mean art , since the whole basis of Ambrose 's and my new relationship resided in this . A lucky man , a thankful man ... hmm . How come he had n't said a happy man ? But was n't " dealing with a full deck " one definition of happiness ? I would just have to wait . Water his plants , work on my painting , and show myself worthy of a rent-free summer . When I puffed up the five flights of stairs around four , carrying a secondhand studio easel , solvents and a number 22 sable , which I actually did n't need for the 14-by-18-inch canvas I 'd bought , Ambrose 's phone was ringing . It stopped when I got inside , then almost immediately started again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been ? She had been calling me all afternoon . " We 're still having dinner . Are n't we ? I ca n't stand to be alone . I 'm afraid I 'll do something awful . Do you know what I almost did , Violet ? " She had booked an afternoon flight for Rome . Then realized he would already have left Rome by the time she got there . " That 's when I started calling you . . . . I could n't remember where he said he was going . I was pretty sure he said Siena , but then I thought no , Sicily . Now that plane 's left . I had to call the airport back and change to tomorrow 's flight . Are you still coming ? Only "  --  she laughed wildly  --  " I have n't got any food , I have n't shopped . Wait , I have a better idea . I 'll just hop in a cab and come down there . "  | " Are you sure you want to do that ? I mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better she comes here than goes to Siena . Well , there went my quiet weekend of painting . I had planned to beginmy self-portrait , something on the order of Holbein the Younger . Now she gave a different laugh , a sort of menacing snarl . " And why not , ma petite soeur ? Two hundred Waverly has been my Village pied-a-terre for three years . Just as my humble abode has been a certain person 's cozy uptown retreat . That is , unless you 'd rather I did n't come . Perhaps you want your cozy retreat all to yourself . " I assured her I did not , that I was her friend and would expecther as soon as she could get there . Then I rushed out and bought a barbecued chicken , a pound of potato salad , and blew the remainder of my week 's salary on a fifth of gin , my departed grandmother 's favorite antidote to psychic pain . It was an eye-opening twenty-four hours in more ways than one . Accompanying Sheila up and down the scale of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I found myself wondering if you could ever know what someone else was really like . Perhaps no one had a stable personality , but people simply vibrated different emotional frequencies , depending upon the lights or darknesses of the moment . She had arrived wearing no makeup , her bright hair completelyobscured by a kerchief , clad in some nondescript gray slacks and a grizzled shapeless top that I swear to God resembled a hair shirt . The glossy health and beauty editor with her vivid-bright colors was nowhere to be seen . Also gone was any sign of the blushing friendly Big Sister . The trusting dog-blue eyes were shot with hours of weeping and rage . We talked mostly about him . Rather , she talked . " For three years we went everywhere together . He depended on me for everything . I was the one who went to Tiffany 's and bought your wedding present and had it sent . He said he could always trust in my taste . I almost got a silver calling-card tray , but who uses those anymore ? "  | " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather disappointed that my uncle had n't selected my wedding gift himself . " I remember looking at the stationery that day . I chose the kind I would order when . . . It was a light-gray background with a thin border of blue . I was going to have the Mrs. AmbroseV . Clay ' in blue italic , and our address . . . We would have had to move out of here ; it 's too small for two people really to function , no matter how in love they are "  --  and she dismissed the room with an airy flutter of her hand . " I mean , there is n't even a decent closet where I could hang my clothes . " Then she seemed to falter , unsure of where she was . " Oh , God ! " she shrieked . " It ca n't be true , it ca n't , it ca n't ! Please tell me it 's not true ! " I poured more gin into her ice and tonic and worried about the neighbors . A few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tiffany'sdissolved into a vengeful harpy who narrated to me in a low , brittle voice , how , several months ago , she had hired a detectiveto follow Ambrose . " I 'd seen him flash by in a Mercedes with a woman , only an hour after he 'd left my apartment to go home and write . ' Yes , my dear , I had your slippery uncle trailed for one whole week . That 's all I could afford , and the detective was a low-bred little man . Well , would you like to hear what I found out ? Do n't look so worried . It does you good to know the truth  --  were n't you preaching that to me just this morning ? My little detective came back with his greasy black notebook and enlightened me considerably . Three afternoons a week , from one to five , your illustrious uncle was a salesman at the Mercedes-Benzshowroom on Park Avenue . On the other afternoons , he played squash and swam at the Sixty-third Street Y. On the evenings he could n't see me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat downstairs in the corner bar telling dirty jokes with some gray-haired woman and playing boogie-woogie on their ratty piano . And the rest of the time  --  God forbid he might have to go back to his lonely room and face that novel !  --  he was over in Sheridan Square , loafing in the bookstore . Well , ma pe/tite soeur , voila ! Your uncle , the dedicated author who robbed me of my best years . At least you get the information free . I had to shell out a hundred and fifty bucks . " " At least you found out it was n't another woman , " I replied , a little crestfallen from these revelations . " That was three months ago . Who knows what he 's been doingsince then ? " " But I thought you saw him frequently . " " Not lately . He 's been acting strange . Every time I call him , he pleads his book . What a joke , that book ! He is n't interested in writing a book . It would be too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way married men use their worn-out wives on their mistresses . To get away when they 're bored . " " Maybe you 're better off now , " I said , helping myself to more gin . " Look at it that way . That you 're well rid of a slippery fake . " This triggered the appearance of yet another Sheila . " Do n't say that , " she moaned . " He was the gentlest , kindest man I ever met . Oh , poor , poor darling . He 's going to be miserable with this woman . She trapped him some horrible way , I 'm sure of it . When he understands , he 'll come back to me . I know it . I feel it . On this note she passed out . I hauled her dead weight , which could still stagger , to the big brass bed and covered her up and ate the potato salad and both legs of the chicken . I tried my new easel in various spots and drank a little more gin . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the other side of the bed . I was waked sometime later by a persistentmelancholy tune washing over my eardrums in wave after wave of amplified sound . The hi-fi was on full blast . I leaped out of bed and round the corner . There stood Sheila in a trance before the machine . " Jesus Christ , Sheila ! You want me to get evicted ? " I turned down the volume . " Do you know what this is ? " Tears splashed down her cheeks . She held out a plain record jacket . " It 's the music soundp135track they were going to use for his movie . They had already recordedit before everything fell through . We used to lie in bed and listen to it . " " I 've never heard it before . " " Come , " she said , starting the record over , " let 's just lie quietly and listen to it . Then I think I can sleep . Come back to bed . I 'm sorry I woke you . " I decided it was best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I listened for the first time to the background music to the story that had been based on my mother . It was the sort of music the trained ear is embarrassed by and the emotions secretly adore : a searching but comfortably repetitive melody of low strings against a background of muted horns that evoked the sea . " We would lie here and he would tell me all his hopes and plans , " she said . " He had this way of stroking the back of my neck . " She turned sideways away from me and reached over and guided my hand to her neck . It was very feverish . " Like this ? " I asked . " No , lighter . Just teasing , like feathers . Yes , like that . Oh , God , is it possible ? If I could have looked into the future a year ago  --  I was probably even lying in this bed  --  and seen this coming . . . He might even have been stroking my neck . " She burst into the most heartbroken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play games like that with yourself , " I said , curling up against her , as years ago I had lain beside my roommate Pequena , who often woke up and confused the darkness with going blind . The sound track for the dead Lora Lee switched itself off . When my arm got too tired to tickle her neck anymore , I kept it protectively round her and we fell asleep that way . On Sunday I fed her breakfast and at about three in the afternoon she pronounced herself over her foolishness and asked if she could borrow my lipstick , which I thought was a good sign . She took a taxi uptown and said she was going to write to her daddy and have an early night . Monday I arrived at work at the usual time . Sheila was not there yet , but she was often tardy , so I got out my inks  --  Ip136worked in a closet-sized cubicle next to hers  --  and started work on a series of summer shape-up exercises . At ten-thirty her phone rang . It was Sheila herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me a favor and tell Marge I wo n't be in today ? " " Sure . Are you feeling okay ? Maybe I could come by on my lunch hour . " " Oh , I wo n't be in , I 'm afraid . I 'm feeling fine , though , since you ask . The reason I wo n't be able to make it to the office is . . . Do you promise you wo n't tell a soul ? " I promised . " I 'm getting married . That 's why I wo n't be able to come in today . Or tomorrow , for that matter . " She gave a faraway tinkly laugh . " You 'll just have to carry on without me . " " Sheila ? Are you kidding ? " " No , dear , I have never been more serious in my life . It 's you who 've been kidding inc . " " Sheila , I do n't understand . " " Oh , yes you do , you naughty girl . Though I ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yourself . But luckily I saw through you . I 'm on my way to him now . " " What airline ? What flight ? " I had the presence to ask , for an unpleasant truth was surfacing . Again the glassy faraway laugh . " Now , Violet . Tout va bien . Do n't try and spoil it again . " She hung up . After I regained my calm , I used that telephone within an inch of its life . I beat her to the TWA building at Kennedy by an hour . I had encountered what might be called " madness " only once . One day in sixth grade at Pine Hollow our math teacher started throwing chalk at us and chanting , " Dirty little beasts , dirty little beasts ! " Someone slipped out and got the principal . Several days later we were informed that Miss Greany had had " a nervous breakdown . " But how could anyone , watching Sheila saunter through those glass doors , as composed as if she 'd just stepped off thep137cover of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nervous anything ? Ever since that day , when I watched her glide up to the ticket counter , set down her little Louis Vuitton overnight bag and slap down her credit card , I feel differently about the beautifully composed people I see crossing my perimeters . I no longer dismiss them as all-of-a-piece figures , luckier and simpler than I. Of course , the overnight bag was one of the giveaways to Sheila 's condition . The doctor from Payne Whitney who had met me at the airport and now waited with me explained this . The distressed Sheila was acting out going to Rome ; the practical , clothes-wise Sheila had not packed to go any farther than where she knew , somehow , we 'd have sense enough to get her to . She had been there before . I had called her father , the dermatologist in Dallas . I explainedwho I was and he said yes , his daughter had written to him about me . He believed Sheila had been seeing a good deal of my uncle for some time , as well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ambrose had gone and gotten married and the effect of this on Sheila . " She was terribly upset at first , then she got better , but now she suddenly says she 's flying to Italy to marry him . . . or maybe she 's just kidding me . " " She 's not kidding you , " he said , and became very professional . He told me he was going to call a friend at New York Hospital and asked me to sit there till he called me back . Now I said to the doctor , a pleasant-looking balding man in his mid-thirties , wearing tennis shoes ( Dr. Benton had caught him just as he 'd been leaving for his game ) : " Should n't we stop her before she buys the ticket ? " " No , let her complete the transaction . It 's no problem cancelinga credit card charge . " He laughed ruefully . " Some part of her knows that , at this moment . " He had helped treat Sheila during her last stay at the clinic . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her mother died . She had calmly received the news by telephone  --  it had been a first heart attack  --  and flown home to Dallas . She went to the funeral and did not break down once , kissed her father goodbye and re/turned to Miss Finch 's . Several weeks later , she began telephoninghome , asking to speak to her mother . The first few calls were taken by the maid , a Negro woman who had cared for Sheila since childhood , and who , for some kindly superstitious reason of her own , would simply reply , " Sheila honey , your mamma 's not here now , you know that . " But then Sheila wanted to know when she would be home , why did n't she ever stay home anymore ? By the time one of her calls reached the doctor , Sheila was screaming . She accused him of hiding her mother to punish her for leaving them . Dr. Benton had taken the next plane east . Now the nice balding doctor went up to Sheila , who blinked flirtatiously and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he going to Rome on the same flight , by any chance ? She either did not see me sitting in the background , or she pretended not to . The doctor explained that her father had called and wanted her to have some tests before she left the country . She nodded , very serious and amenable . She seemed to have forgotten the ticket she had just purchased and slipped into her purse . She agreed to ride back to town and check into the clinic and have the tests . " Is n't it lucky that I brought my gown and toothbrush , " she told him . Then he pointed out my presence and said we could all ride back together . " Why are you here , Violet ? Why did you come ? " asked Sheila . " Why are n't you at your desk , at the office ? I told you not to come out to see me off . It 's such a waste of money . I 'm in very good hands , I can assure you . " She opened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Take this and run along back to work . " I started to refuse it , but I got a look from the doctor . " Violet will make her own way back , " said Sheila firmly . " She 's a big girl now . " Then , before we went our separate ways , she nudged me aside and whispered in my ear , " I have known this doctor for years . He has always been in love with me . . . hopelessly , of course . He somehow found out I was going to elope with your uncle . I 'm going to play along with him and go quietly so he wo n't make a scene . I hate scenes , do n't you ? "  |p139Then  she winked at me and giggled like a schoolgirl , and off they went , the doctor springily , in his tennis shoes , and Sheila erect and beautiful with her swinging career-girl stride . He had taken the Vuitton bag and held her arm lightly , like an escort . I returned to town on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go back to work and took a taxi down to the Village . I would probably lose my job anyway . With the rest of Sheila 's twenty dollars I bought a cold supper and some more tonic and another fifth of gin . I thought of Ambrose , lucky and thankful with his bride in Siena , now safe from the transatlantic arrival of a certain beautiful skeleton from " A. Valentine " ' s closet . And of Sheila , surrounded by anxious professionals all dedicated to cleansing her mind of this new layer of painful shadows . Having been the Strong One all weekend , I now felt let down when there was no pressing reason , nor any audience , for my further good example . I curled up in the window seat , my head tickled by the friendly swaying of the hanging coleus , watching the afternoonfade , sipping a cool gin and tonic , and reading Ambrose'sold letters to my grandmother . He had divided them up , according to various periods of his adult life , in separate plastic sandwich bags . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Newbury , England , where he 'd been stationed before D-day , a bag for Hollywood , a bag for New York , and one bag labeled simply " On The Road . " He had marked various passages of certainletters and , in some cases , written notes in the margin  --  " Use for scene on beach , " " Have L. say this . " He obviously planned to use these letters in his novel . When I had first discovered the letters in the bottom drawer of his desk , I had determined to inflict a moral handicap on my snooping intentions by making myself read them in chronological order . The Basic Training ones were a drag . He was either " on duty , " or having dinner with " one of the boys who lives at home " ( much descriptionof food ) , or washing out his clothes ( with a touch of self-pity ) back at the base , or speculating ( with a touch of Rupert Brooke ) on his impending active duty . I felt I 'd done enough for him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the New York bag ( by far the thickest ) ,  |p140to  see what else I could learn about the secret life of A. Valentineup until the death of my grandmother . I had not found any trace of her side of the correspondence . " Many thanks for the small loan , " I read , in one of the early letters . His writing was leisurely , with lots of flourishes , as if the hand had been in love with its own penmanship . " Am changing my tactics on Last Hero , using more understatement now . If I get on paper what I want , we 'll throw a shindig that 'll send all the old biddies on East Battery to their fainting couches , then we 'll build a bonfire and roast marshmallows over the embers of our old mortgages . " " Have been in a slump , " began another ( written the summer I 'd been with Granny ) . " Better now , thanks to your care package and the good advice . A man of words had also better be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And a bit later , " You are one angel Momma . And thanks also for the nice socks . Have been reading Dostoevsky 's Diary of a Writer tonight to put some fire into me . Women are our great hope , he writes , they will manage to save much . " True to her promise , Ambrose 's new wife wrote to me within the week . My first thought upon turning over the envelope and seeing a crest on the back with Castello Marciano , Siena , in raised script beneath was : Of course ! Ambrose has married a princess , castle and all . It seemed fitting somehow , since he had waited so long to marry anybody.  |p141But  on skimming the closely written pages , to take the edge off my curiosity before I could settle down and read calmly , I learned that her maiden name was Gruber , that she had grown up in New York City , that she was forty years old  --  born , coincidentallyon February 14 , 1926 , the same day as Ambrose  --  and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leather known as Dura-Pelt . And every spring she made a working-holiday trip to Italy 's leather capital to garner new ideas for her own future lines . " I first laid eyes on your uncle , " she wrote , in a brisk and regular script I would come to know well , " in the Uffizi , in the room with all the blondes , as I now tease him . All those North Italian girls with their pale tresses , the Botticellis . A handsome twentieth-century man surrounded by a roomful of beautiful fifteenth-centurywomen . It was an aesthetic sight in itself . As an artist you will understand this . " She had thought he was Italian . But a while later , he sat down at the next table from hers in an outdoor cafe and after writing several postcards ( the ones to Sheila and me ? ) looked up and asked her in careful Italian if she knew where he could buy stamps . ( " The funny thing was , he thought I was Italian , becauseof my black hair and Gucci shoes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in New York and he joined me at my table and we had lunch and some wine . Then we mailed his postcards and went to look at Dante 's house , which was very near . " ) He told her about his Holiday assignment . He 'd already done Venice and the photographer was meeting him the next day in Rome . " And I offered to drive him , since I had a car and he had been planning to take the train . " She wrote , rather disarmingly , that " I fell in love with him almost at once , on the first day I think . He fell in love with me too , not at first sight or anything , but after we had been together a few days and discovered more about each other . " I read much into this sentence . But I had been correct about the castle . It was a real castle , in the Tuscan hills , built by a fourteenth-century duke . It hadp142an Olympic-sized pool and central heating . ( " Some friends of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up ; they rent it out , mostly to Americans who have always had a yearning to live in a real castle . " ) She and Ambrose would stay through the summer , she said . She had been married to her job long enough and it would be good for him to finish " The Writer 's Italy " while in Italy ; it would give it that bit of extra snap . ( " Then also , he 's full of ideas for his new novel , which sounds very exciting . " ) She promised to send " some snapshots of the castle and the late-blooming lovebirds " in her next letter and told me she had half a notion to tempt me into flying over and joining them . " But I wo n't tempt you , because you 're starting to make your own way and that is so important . I went overboard in making mine ( after my parents were killed in a stupid car crash twenty years ago , I just had to prove that my father had been justified in leavingso @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I had practically forgotten how to live . But your uncle is lovingly reteachingme . Now I look around me and take deep breaths of air and enjoy each moment as it comes . " Then she tactfully damped down the ardor that was beginning to rise from the page by saying that Ambrose sent his love and said not to bother about sending any shirts , he would have some made in Florence , and that she already thought of me as the sister she had always wanted . Well , I thought , each time I reread her letter , it 's no crime per se to marry someone with money . And who is to say he did n't fall in love with her before she told him she owned factories ? And she does sound interested in his work . Now he can get on with it with no distractions . He does n't even have to bother sending for his old shirts . Knowing she thought of me , too , that she already claimed me as a sister , made my present financial situation less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything . But knowing she was out there with Ambrose , annexed to the Clay family for betteror for worse , I could take a more tranquil attitude toward thep143future . " This marriage is going to be good for everybody , " Ambrosehad said , and now I felt the same . Not surprisingly , I had been let go from Vogue . The new health and beauty editor would want to hire her own assistant , if she felt she needed one . I was given two weeks ' pay for my services , which was generous , considering how little I had actuallycontributed to the magazine during my short occupancy in my adjunct mini-cubicle . Sheila was doing nicely over at Payne Whitney . Her father invited me to have dinner with him at the Plaza . He was a slim gray-haired man who watched his diet . He thanked me for my quick thinking and for being his daughter 's friend , and said he knew I 'd understand that she was n't quite ready to meet me again . He claimed to know very little about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said , was skin , and he had his hands full just keeping the many afflictions that could affect that surface in control  --  or sometimes not . He reported that his daughter was responding to medication , had stopped looking out the window , waiting for Ambrose to come and marry her , and had even admitted to the doctors that she had n't seen Ambrosea whole lot within the past year . Dr. Benton planned to take her back to Dallas at the end of the week . She had already been on the phone to Neiman-Marcus and had a job waiting for her . Her father said that in his humble opinion , everybody had one or two crazy areas , just as there were certain areas of the epidermis that , through a combination of factors , were more liableto " breakouts " than surrounding areas . Sheila 's mental makeup was on the whole very sound and practical . " It simply refuses to tolerate the loss of loved ones , that 's all . " He very much wanted his daughter to fall in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . As for me , the high was beginning to fade from my New York experience . I , too , now ran for the subway , even when I was n't in a hurry . I had stopped noticing my surroundings as much . Beingunemployed , I took to sleeping late , and then it needed all my will power to stay inside and paint when the sun was alreadyp144high . Even as I worked , my mind was distracted . I was thinking : I should begin looking for another job soon ; or , more ignobly : If I do n't go out for lunch soon , all the interesting-looking people in that restaurant will have finished their lunch and gone back to wherever they go . I ate in the same restaurant every day  --  joint would be a better description of it . Most of the clientele ate eggs and hash browns at noon and had paint on their clothes and under their fingernails . I gave as much thought to the book I took along with me to " read " as I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eye that I would be worth striking up a conversation with . But so far , my Either/Or and Fry 's Last Lectures had seemed only to reinforce my isolation . Perhaps the eye that I would have been interested in decided it would be useless to compete with such perspicacious companions . I was left to plow undisturbed through " The Diary of a Seducer , " and " Negro Art " until I all but floated back to my apartment on coffee refills , to dutifully resume work on " Self-Portrait . " I am sorry to report that the thrill had gone out of it almost as soon as I 'd set up my work space and done the preliminary sketch and imprimatura . Why had I wanted to do a self-portrait anyway ? The impetus was Ambrose 's Holbein postcard , probably . But exactly what , at this point , did I want to record for posterity about my self-concept ? The trouble , seemed to lie here . What about me was interesting enough to commit in oil pigment to canvas ? In retrospect , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aspect of my youthful self , like Diirer 's silverpoint of himself at thirteen , would be cause for celebration . Meanings would be assigned to chance brush strokes , flaws in perspective , even . The afternoons were long , especially now that there was no prospect of company in the evenings . One afternoon , out of sheer need to be recognized for myself , I made an appointment with Michel , the hairdresser of Fifty-seventh , for a wash and trim . " And how are things at Vogue ? " he asked , shampooing me himself . I brought him up to date , saying merely that my bossp145had decided to move back to Texas . " Ah , so now you will be looking for something else , " he murmured . He seemed to have a genuine French accent , rather heavy at that . " Oh , I may just stay home and paint during the summer , " I said , " or at least till my money runs out . My uncle is honeymooning in Italy and he 's left me his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl , " he replied , smiling . He had nice teeth that reminded me of a small animal 's . " Relax your neck , now . Your neck is so tense . " " What are you doing ? " I asked . " Massaging the scalp a little . Lean back . Relax . " His fingers made strong , practiced little circles around my head , working from back to front . By the time he reached my temples , I was almost in a trance . " You like that , eh ? " He stood above me , a small , self-proud man , his pelvis tilted close to my cheek . A look passed between us . I quickly closed my eyes , embarrassed . " Did you learn that in your school ? " I asked , trying to sound like a patron . " I learned the relaxation points . . . here and here , " he said , " but the touch is my own . " A few nights later the phone rang . " Is this Violet Clay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a crank call , someone parodying a heavy foreign accent . It was Michel . " How did you get my number ? " I asked . " Oh , that is not so difficult . I made a few false tries , that is all . " He asked me how my painting was going and how I was enjoying my rent-free apartment . He then asked if I would like to go out with him sometime . " Thank you , " I said , " that 's very nice of you . I 'd love to , but ... you see , I 'm trying to finish this painting . " " You paint all day and all night ? " " No , but ... " I hedged . " It takes a while for me to work up the right mood . I 'm ridiculously easy to distract , so I just have to make it difficult for myself . " " I think you also like to make it difficult for me , eh ? " " No , no , it 's not that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . some reason you would prefer not to go out with me , " he suggested . Which was of course the whole thing . I was lonely , but notp146desperate enough to start dating my hairdresser . " No , you 're very nice . I 'm sure any woman would be pleased to go out with you . " " Well , what is the problem ? A friendly dinner will not upset your painting . It will relax you . You are a very tense girl . " " I am ? " " Yes , I noticed it when you came to the shop . But I do n't want to make you more tense . Have you a pencil ? Yes , all artists have a pencil . Here is my number . I am almost always home in the evenings . Me and Beatrice . That 's my toy poodle . When you feel like some company , a nice meal , pick up the phone and call Michel . " Really touched by the gallant way he 'd let me off the hook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I said it might be some time , I just could n't predict how my summer would go . " I understand . Anyway , it has been nice having this conversation with you . " Then I hung up and felt like a bourgeois snob . I saw him as a kind man , who had noticed my tenseness . My loneliness probablystuck out a mile as well . And he was attractive . Those small , healthy animal teeth . . . and foreign accents always added that little bit of mystique . If I had met him , say , at a diplomatic party , I would not have had a moment 's hesitation in accepting his invitation . Besides , a man who spent most of his evenings alone with a dog named Beatrice could not be too bad . I picked up the phone and called him back . " Hello , " he said . " And how has your summer been going ? " I got into the habit of going to Michel 's several times a week . We both hated eating alone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a modern high-rise building with a fountain in the downstairs lobby . I 'd meet him at the corner of Fifty-seventh and Fifth when he got off work , then we 'd take the bus to his street , go up and get Beatrice and take her back down again for her walk , and then Michel would cook supper ( he was an excellentchef , baked his own bread and made his own tarragon dressing ) and we 'd eat it in front of the TV . He already had a colorp147set . When we got better acquainted he showed me movies of his immigration to America and the friends he 'd made on the ship . I noticed that his teeth in the movies were brownish and broken ; he had had them all capped as soon as he prospered in the New World . He was in love with all modern devices : his apartment was crammed with complicated stereo components and lamps that bubbled up designs in colored oils . After we 'd eaten , and drunk a bottle of Bordeaux and watched our programs ( Ed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ switching on gadgets , and as soon as the lamps began bubbling their oils and Frank Sinatra had settled into his first album , Michel would lie down on one of the angora rugs , very still and fully dressed , even with shoes , and then it would be my duty to " awaken " the Reluctant Robot . I would have to do all the work , undress both of us , a little at a time , till our two pale bodies danced with eerie reflections from the bubbling colors . I would endeavor , in the manner he 'd tacitly instructed me , to bring to life his furled sex . This was not always successful . But on the evenings it was , he would writhe and moan and finally begin chanting in rapid French ; then suddenly his flesh would become steel and he would turn on me like a machine man , and I 'd find myself in the grip of a monster with a mindless will . It was the nearest I 've ever come to being satisfied by a machine , quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meditatively on the angora , often with furry Beatrice wriggling around between us , neither of us speaking , watching the patterns the lamps made . Around midnight , he and Beatrice would escort me down on the elevator and I would be sent home , like a lady , in a taxi . On the evenings I did not go to Michel 's , I had concocted for myself a rather desperate little act to relieve the loneliness . I would dress very carefully and then " whisk down " to the little corner bar  --  the one with the old piano to which Sheila 's detectivehad tracked Ambrose  --  and buy a pack of cigarettes , and whisk right back upstairs again . It made a break in the long summernight to follow , and it gave me something to look forward to . I understood perfectly why Ambrose had sought refuge downp148there . If I had been a man , I , too , would have sat at the old painted piano and played boogie-woogie and waited to see who 'd come along . But the ideals of Southern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might play robot games on the floor of my hairdresser 's apartment , but I would never sit down by myself with a drink in a public bar . What I vaguely hoped for , however , was that on my nightly cigarette run ( I did n't exactly smoke ; I could never learn to inhale ) , someone would detain me , in a gentlemanlike way , and ask me to sit down . But such a person , when you thought about it , could not possibly be a gentleman to make the kind of time he 'd have to make if he were to snatch me out of that split-second nightly sprint . One evening , I was just on the verge of giving up and retreatingback to my lonely pinnacle for a solitary read ( I was attempting to reread my uncle 's first novel , Looking for the Lora Lee ) when a husky , amused voice called from the darkness of one of the booths , " Where 's your guy ? Where 's old Fitzie ? Have n't seen him around lately . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hang-down hair . She beckoned me over to where she was sitting comfortably in the company of her drink and an ashtray full of cigarette butts . I sauntered over , trying to keep the pleasure from spilling absurdly from every crack in my face . " Hi , " I said . " Ambrose is in Italy . By the way , he 's not exactly my guy . He 's my uncle . " " Your uncle ? Sit down . Have a drink . What 's Fitz doing in Italy ? " " He 's on assignment for a magazine . " Having just lost one friend to Ambrose 's marriage , I was being more cautious . " And what about you ? You live around here ? What would you like ? I 'm drinking Scotch . But maybe you 'd rather have beer . " " Yes , thank you . Beer would be nice . I 'm staying at Ambrose'splace till he comes back . " She was looking me over , smiling a sort of side smile and nodding ironically , either at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . Close up she looked older than she had on the street . She smelled of years of cigarettes . " How about letting me have a fag , " she said . " I 'm fresh out . " " Sure . " I handed over the pack . " Help yourself . Take a couplefor later , too . " She raised her eyebrows and expertly slit open the pack with a dirty nail . " Thanks . What did you say you were doing in New York ? " I remembered how Ambrose had said she had once been a successful painter , with shows and everything . Suddenly I felt very shy across from this ironic-smiling , world-weary woman . I made light of myself . " I 'm just one more Southern girl who 's come north to seek her fortune . " " Hmm , " she said , lighting the cigarette and taking a hungry drag . " And what are you going to do to seek it ? " " Well , " I said , " I 'm a painter like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Used to be . Now I 'm more of a designer . I design other people 's dirty thoughts . What do you do  --  abstract ? " She said this last word with such a sneer that I realized there was no need for me to be defensive about my figurative leanings . " I have done a few , " I said , " but to tell the truth , they bore me . I 'm just not interested in setting up some problem about hot and cool or white on white or flat on flatter . Or ruining my eyesight making tiny little straight lines that ruin everybody else 's eyesight when they 're hung on the walls . " " You 'd better get your pretty ass back to the South , then . You 're hopelessly out of fashion . " But she was looking at me with more liking as she said this . What had happened to her career ? Had she gone out of fashion ? " Surely , " I said , " there are some people who still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Surely . " Was she mocking my accent ? " People wealthyenough to have their portraits painted  --  flatteringly , of course . Or there 's always the women 's mags , illustrating for them . Orp150there 's what I do , which is all too human . Only humans could imagine such degradation . " " if you feel like that , why do you do it ? " " There are certain advantages to not starving for one 's ideals . I 'm saving up for my old age . I 'm going to retire to Vermont . I 've already bought a farmhouse there . " " And then you 'll go back to painting , " I said encouragingly . " Nope . I 'm going to raise dogs . I 'm going to have little doggiesrunning all over my ten acres , barking their hearts out for joy at being able to run where they like and shit where they please , when they please . " " I think I saw your dog that night I was with my uncle , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go on about painting : " It was a very attractive dog , very unusual . " " You saw Tang ? My little Tang 's worth ten human beings . " Her voice rose a pitch and all irony went out of it as she told me about Tang . He descended from a very valuable litter of Shih Tzus brought from China to England in the iggos by Lady Somebody . Tang 's ancestors had been raised by eunuchs at the Chinese court . The best dogs had their portraits woven on tapestries and the eunuchs who had raised them were given gifts by the emperor . Tang himself was lively , arrogant and highly intelligent . She told me the tricks Tang did and how he had once almost died choking on a chicken bone . I guess I acted interestedand made all the proper responses because she got quite friendly and asked me how I planned to support myself until I made my fortune . I told her my Vogue story . " I still have a little cash left because I do n't have to pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to get something soon . I suddenly had an idea . Why not see if I could get on at her place of work ? It would probably pay ten times what aboveboard magazines did , and I could work at home and have time for my own painting as well . " I 'm very good at doing figures , bodies in all sorts of positions , " I told her . " Do they happen to need anyone else where you work ? " " There 's no one place , " she said . " I 'm free lance . They call me . You might say I 've become known in my field . "  | " Oh . I see . " I must have touched her sympathies in some way , because , after stubbing out one cigarette and lighting another , she said , " Maybe Landsborough might have something for you . It 's not a fancy place , but if you need to pick up a buck or two . .. I used to do stuff for him . He 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eye for the girls . Let me have that pack again . " I thought she was going to demand another handful of cigarettesfor the price of her job tip , but no , she only wanted to tear off a corner to write down a telephone number . " I think this is still right , " she said . " It 's been a long time since I did stuff for him . But if it 's wrong , it 's Landsborough Productions  --  youmight look it up in the directory . If it 's not there , he 's gone out of business or left town or something . Anyway , it 's worth a try . If he 's still in business , you trot on over and show him your stuff . You 're a cute kid ; he 'll probably come up with something . " " Thank you . I really appreciate this . " " Glad to do it . How long did you say old Fitz 'd be over in Italy ? " " It 's sort of nebulous at the moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might be all summer . " " Some assignment . Well , it 's nice if you can get it . I 'm happy for him . He deserves a break . He 's kept us all laughing down here many a night , and I say a guy that can make others laugh deserves to have a few breaks . Do n't you agree ? Want another beer . . . Hey , I do n't even know your name . " " Violet . Yours is Elvira , he told me . No , thanks . I ought to get back . " " He told you , eh ? Is n't it a pisser ? Named after a great-aunt . What else did he tell you about me ? " " Just that you all were good buddies . " " That we are , " she said , looking almost young and shy for a minute . She blew out a long stream of blue smoke . " You tell him Ellie says hi when you write him , okay ? " " I will . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I suddenly sawp152myself twenty years hence , sitting in a bar with long untidy gray hair , counting the days till I could retire to the wilderness and raise dogs when once I had hoped to be a great painter . " Call old Landsborough , " she said , " but watch his hands . " Carol 's next letter arrived . Several color prints fell out . One of the happy couple , standing by the pool , the famous Tuscan hills in the background . Carol wore a simple one-piece suit , like a racing suit . There was nothing awful about her body . Her hair was dark and wet . As she was facing into the sun , it was hard to tell about her face . Her teeth were good and white . Her smile seemed very happy . Ambrose looked less of the man about town , possibly because his hair fell down over his forehead and was not parted in its neat F. Scott Fitzgerald way . There was a tiny roll of flesh around the waist . He , too , looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the castle , one taken close up , from in front of the peeling stone walls where they parted for the iron gate , and one from the bottom of the hill , on the other side of the vineyards . The castle was a dark ocher , with faded orange shutters , and looked more like a rambling old country house with a perpendicular wing at either end . In one of the photos were two men in the distance . They were wearing what looked like pajamas made out of mattress ticking . From their demeanor , I guessed they must be servants . Had one of them taken the photo of Ambrose and Carol ? In the letter , Carol described the high ceilings , the parqueted floors , and the redblack-and-whitemosaic tiles in the bathrooms . And the marble stairs , the old portraits , the flowers in the garden , the stone fireplaces . An eighteenth-century harpsichord with candleholders built on . She wrote that the headboard of their bed had medievalfigures carved into the pine , " Some kind of procession , with horses and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ palio . " She described what the palio was ( " a local horse race with costumes and religion thrown in  --  the first one takes place in early July " ) . She said she and Ambrose were taking Italian lessons and had met a very nice American couple ; he was a Fulbright professor whose specialty was the influence of the Italian Renaissance on Germany . ( " He 's taken a great interest in Ambrose 's article ,  |p153given  him all sorts of information he did n't know . . . . ApparentlyGoethe believed no poet 's apprenticeship was complete unless he knew his Italy . . . so Ambrose is deep into Wilhelm Meister and then we 're all going up to Lago Maggiore because he feels he must get the atmosphere right . I 'm hopeful that he 'll soon be winding up this assignment and getting back to the novel .... " ) My own " assignment " was not turning out at all . Every time I looked at my self-portrait , a sick feeling rose up in my chest . It got to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at it for the idea of it to sap my spirit . One morning I lay in bed , made my resolution , then before I could change my mind rushed over and took a big brush and a jar of gesso and covered it over . There : all white again . I was too divided at the moment , I told myself . How could anyone paint from the wellsprings of the soul with half her vision focused on dwindling cash reserves ? For days , the scrap with Landsborough 's phone number had bided its time stuck in the corner of Ambrose 's mirror . Now I felt its hour had come . I called and a man 's rich Scottish burr replied , " Landsborough Productions , Stewart Landsborough here . " I made my pitch ( I was so nervous , I had written it out first on a piece of paper ) and he said he had nothing to offer an artist at the moment . " My firm does mostly reprints these days . The market for new war books has sadly declined . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long nut-brown hair to her waist ? " War books ? Was he trying to put me on ? " I 'm afraid it 's mostly gray now , " I said . No , maybe he was testing me . After all , I might be a policewoman in disguise , trying to get him to reveal his dirty enterprises over the phone . " Look , Mr. Landsborough , could n't I just come and see you for about ten minutes and show you what I can do ? " " Gray , is it ? Has it been that long ? I suppose it has . We 're all getting on . How do you happen to know Elvira ? " Ah , I was beginning to see . He had to make sure I was n't a policewoman trying to break his front . " Actually , she and my uncle are good friends . " " And who is your uncle ? "  | " Ambrose Clay , the writer . " " What has he written ? " " Well , his most popular book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It came out a little while ago , actually . " " It sounds familiar . In fact , I think I read it . About a girl on a yacht giving a GI a hard time ? " He pronounced it " girrul . " " That 's the one ! Actually , the girl is based on my mother . She 's dead now , of course . " " I 'm sorry to hear that . " He asked me a few more questions about myself . " You sound like a very enthusiastic young woman . As I say , I 've nothing for you , but if you 'd care to drop by my office about eleven-thirty next Tuesday , perhaps I can come up with some suggestions after we 've talked . " " And you 've seen my work . " " Yes , by all means bring your work along . " He made it sound naughty and poetic : " wirruk . " I felt we understood one another perfectly , without ever having once referred to pornography . Why , social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much like Charleston . Everything based heavily on nuance and whom you knew . I felt very pleased with the way I 'd handled things , and set about to " wirruk " up my porno portfolio for Mr. Landsborough between then and Tuesday . Sick of my easel 's reproaches , I covered Ambrose 's dining table with newspapers and got water and inks . Now to think of something dirty . The only pornographic art I had seen was Rowlandson'sand Picasso 's and Dali 's . What exactly was pornography ? That it was intended to arouse sexual desire I knew , but that depended on whose desire you were trying to arouse . When I was sixteen , I had been throbbingly aroused by a scene in a historical novel when a woman announced to a man she wanted to " give herself to him completely . " Whereas it might take more than that for the jaded pervert who went to blue movies every afternoon . What level should I aim for ? The thought of hard-core stuff made me sick . It made me hate the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something light and witty , a combination of playfulness and eroticism . I set to work ,  |p155already  imagining myself bringing a fresh dimension to the old art . Elvira might be the lady pornographer ; I would be the ladylikepornographer . I shuffled through my own recent erotic experiences . What could I use from them ? I tried a quick " comic strip " of Michel 's and my ritual  --  a metal-jointed robot with a single human attributelying curled like an early spring fern , and then its progressivecultivation by the maiden till it bloomed dangerously and turned to steel and retaliated upon the maiden 's tender bud . It was not very good . It was coy  --  banal , wooden in movement , and lacking any surprise . All it succeeded in doing was making me telephone Michel to invite myself for dinner . I was much more successful when I left the men out altogether . I did a somber pen-and-ink sketch of a beautiful woman resembling Sheila lying on a bed and calling upon her own body in a roomful of pictures . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all her hair . The black-and-white man in the pictures wore a selection of Toulouse-Lautrec capes , Charles Dana Gibson dinner clothes and Bogart trench coats . The placement of that single color made an interesting sort of statement on her activity , I thought . Then I did a woman with long witchy hair , kneeling arse-up beside her bed , being diddled from behind by a small dog with a chrysanthemum face and a plumy tail . I left everything in grays and inked in the caption : " My doggy 's worth a dozen men . " Then , getting into the swing , I did two women in a big brass bed . I took this one more seriously . There was the charged echo of the poignant night with Sheila to guide me toward a truly sensualrendering of what it might be like to give oneself up to the caresses of your own kind . With the use of sepia highlights , I heightened the mirror effect so that they became like reflections of one another . " Narcissa 's Lover , " I captioned this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it resolved itself into a flat picture plane against which the two rounded figures seemed to hang swaying in their rapturous embrace . It was eas/ily the most moving and lyrical figurative study I 'd yet accomplished . I was amazed to find I had worked uninterruptedly for a whole afternoon on my " porno portfolio " without once thinking self-consciously : I am now painting what will one day be seen as a breakthrough work of the young Violet Clay . For the first time since I left art school , I had painted with such keen absorptionthat my mouth watered , my cheeks burned and time suspendeditself . When I walked into Landsborough 's office on Tuesday , I really admired the thoroughness of his " cover . " On the walls hung framed enlistment posters for four American wars . In the showcase featuring Landsborough Productions were paperback books with titles like An Anthology of Famous War Stories , Alexander the Great ( for Young Readers ) , A Boy 's Guide to Great Battles and The Valorous Years . Landsborough himself , with his neat black mustache @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man himself when he emerged from an inner office to greet me  --  except for the pronounced limp , of course . One leg was shorter than the other . " How do you do , Miss Clay , " he said , giving me a crushing handshake . " I 'm afraid my girrul 's out sick , so I 'm my own receptionisttoday . Let 's go into my room ; this front one is just for show . " " So I figured , " I said , catching his eye with what I hoped was a knowing look . He reciprocated with an equally direct look , which then roved stealthily over the rest of me and finally came to rest , respectably , on my leather portfolio . " Come , show me your work , " he said , and led me into his inner sanctum . The walls in here were covered with battle scenes . Well , you could n't be too careful , I guessed . He sat down beside me on an old plaid sofa . " Now then , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while he massaged a spicy-smelling tobacco down into the bowl . " What have you brought me ? " He lit up and sat back , waiting to be entertained.  |p157I  had a moment of embarrassment and then unzipped my portfolio , very businesslike , and took out my small sheaf of erotica . " These are just samples , " I said . " There are lots more where these came from . " I passed them over to him and concentrated on the family pictures on his office desk . A nice-looking blond wife with a pained smile , a girl of about fourteen ice-skatingon a pond with a smaller boy . My cheeks felt hot . I hoped he would n't notice and think I was a neophyte at this line of work . I heard him leaf through the heavy watercolor papers . I heard him puff , then puff again . Aromatic smoke trailed past my eyes till they burned . I could n't bear it anymore . I had to look . He had the papers stacked neatly on his lap . He was just sitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sharp blue eyes . " You have very fine draftsmanship , Miss Clay , " he said with his burry r 's . " Thank you . " " And a sense of humor , as well . " " Thank you . " " Remarkable drawings , really , for such a modest young gir-rul . " " Do you think you might . . . use some of them ? " My hopes rose . " Use them ? These particular ... er . . . works ? " " Why , yes . I mean , I do n't exactly know what level you aim for in your books . I probably would n't work out too well illustratingthe hard stuff , but . . . my sort of thing 's more a witty , lyrical eroticism , I think . " " It certainly is , " he agreed . " But tell me , Miss Clay , where do you think I could use your sort of thing ' in the kind of books I print ? Not in Churchill 's boyhood reminiscences , certainly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Front I 'm bringingout this fall . " " Well , " I coaxed , " how about some of the other books on your fall list ? " " But that is my list , " he said . " As I told you on the phone , my market is a sadly declining one . "  |p158I  thought it was time to lay my cards on the table . " Look , Mr. Landsborough , what about the pornographic books , the ones Elvira did drawings for when she worked for you ? " He looked really abashed . " Elvira ? But ... Elvira did jacket designs for me , when I still had a hard-cover line . What on earth are you talking about ? What 's this about pornography ? " " Look , " I said , " Elvira makes no bones about what she does . I do n't see why you should , either . I can promise you I 'm not a member of the vice squad or anything . Besides , I thought the Supreme Court had loosened all that up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little food money , and later some rent money , and I prefer to work at home so I can paint my more serious stuff at the same time . " " This is n't your serious stuff , then , what I 've just seen ? " He was beginning to look amused as he sat there watching me and puffing that infernal pipe . " Of course not . I sat down one afternoon and did these just for you , after Elvira gave me your number . She said she 'd once worked for you , and I naturally assumed ... " So Elvira 's gone over to the porns , has she ? " he mused . " Wonder why ? She had such big plans . That 's why she left me . " It was becoming clear to me that I had made too big an inductiveleap , which had led to this gross mistake . " Oh , God . I feel like such a fool , " I said , beginning to shrivel . " Oh , come , come . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chuckle  --  " it is really very funny . " He took another puff , then removed his pipe from his mouth and burst out laughing . " It is hilariously funny ! Me a publisher of dirty books ! It would certainlysolve some of my financial woes ; perhaps it 's not too late for me to look into the market . Why , what 's the matter ? Good gracious , Miss Clay  --  Violet  --  do n't cry . There 's nothing to cry about . Please do n't . Now please do n't . I have absolutely no defensesagainst a woman 's tears . " Out came the proverbial handkerchief . " You must think I 'm terrible , " I wailed . " Coming in here and showing you these ... "  | " I think they are delightful , " he said . " Now wipe your eyes . I 'm going to take you to lunch . " " Oh , no , please . " " Why not ? A girrul has to eat , does n't she ? I know a nice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or an ale , whichever you prefer . It 's the only place in New York that serves genuine Cornish pasties and Scotch eggs . Come , do n't spoil your eyes . You 'll need them for your wirruk . " " I do n't have any work to speak of . " " We 'll put our heads together over lunch and see what we can come up with . I 've been in this business over twenty years . I have a few connections in the trade , you know . " " You 're very kind , " I snuffled . " You 're very nice yourself , " he said , putting his hand gently on my knee . Too late , I remembered Elvira 's warning . If I were doing " The Apprentice Years of Violet Clay " as a cartoonstrip , I would signal the end of my Euphoric Era by drawingStewart Landsborough and me sitting side by side on his plaid sofa , my portfolio on the floor beside us , his hand on my knee . It would prefigure the rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his honeymoon  --  and his Holiday assignment . And as Ambrose 's shape-shifting summer article , " The Writer 's Italy , " would prove sadly emblematic of his secondnovel 's fate , the second half of my first summer in New Yorkp160would contain most of the seeds of my nine-year-long Era of Compromise . Landsborough took me to his favorite pub , where we filled up on British Isles snacks and he introduced me to my first Guinness  --  first four Guinnesses , to be exact . In the beery haze of our high-backed wooden booth , we exchanged life stories . I shaded mine with Orphan Annie pathos to mute down any overly garish impressions my erotic drawings might have made . He , in his turn , disarmed me by his unself-pitying tale of how he 'd got what he called his " gammy leg . " At eighteen , he 'd come to visit his rich cousins in America  --  the uncle had made a fortunein chewing gum . During a camping trip in the Rockies , Stewart had contracted polio . The uncle , feeling terribly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own sons ) , lavishedhis nephew with the best to be had in physical therapy and settled an immediate legacy on him . " Then the war came . As I could n't enlist on either side of the pond , I went into journalism . I was rewrite man on the old Trib . Then when the regulars came home from overseas , they wanted their old jobs back , so I bought into a pulp syndicate and learned that trade . When the war stories started trickling off the presses , I saw the potential book market  --  this was already the end of the forties ; everybody was beginning to have the blahs . Well , it was high flying while it lasted . " He sighed and laid down his pipe . " Now all folks want to read about is sex and their own neuroses . They do n't give a damn for high courage anymore ; all they want are new ways to indulge themselves . " He clamped a hand over mine . " What do you say , my poor wee fatherless sprite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I agreed , moved in spite of myself by this epithet . Arm in arm , like two Dubliners after a pub crawl , we swayed back to the inner office at Landsborough Productions . I wondered if he even had a secretary . His office phone turned out to have a wall plug and the plaid sofa to conceal a bed . Orphan Annie comes to the city and is seduced by Daddy Warbucks , I thought . But somewhere , it did n't count . I was still nobody in this town , nobody knew me , therefore it did n't really count.  | " Love affairs , " I would explain rather high-mindedly to Jake some years later , after our passion had worn thin and we were beginning to go in for philosophical discussions , " are sometimes a way of exorcising one 's own psychic ghosts . At different stages in the psychodrama of your life , you suddenly find you need to go to bed with your father or commit incest with the brother you never had . Or sometimes you need to balance things out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maybe sheer Eccentricity . Many of our lovers are just projections , externalizations . " " Violet , if they gave a Nobel Prize for whitewashing , you 'd get it . I never knew anyone so adept at manipulating the languageto call a spade everything but a spade . What psychic ghost ' do I represent , then ? " " I do n't know . Besides , I said sometimes . Perhaps you 're the exception . Also , maybe some love affairs last longer because each lover keeps changing into the next necessary projectiondesired by the other . What would you call the spade , then ? " " I 'd call it promiscuity , " he replied ominously , folding his short , muscular arms and looking like a bully . But whatever epithets I might coin to justify or condemn the caprices of the past nine years , nothing could bring those years back , any more than pinpointing where Ambrose chose wisely or wrongly could raise him from the dead . At some point , for each of us , our summer promises had taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first , just like the slightly tired green on the trees along the Thruway outside the window of my bus . It was too late to see them in their spring glory , as Ambrose had when he 'd driven north to the Adirondacks four months earlier . I knew from a recent nature editorial in the Times that leaves stopped producing chlorophyll in mid-July . But they would persist in their disguise of being active till the first frost compelled them to admit the game was up . I wondered if  --  unknown to myself as yet  --  the game was already up for me . People talk glibly of selling out . " So-and-so was a writer ,  |p162then  he went to work in an ad agency . He sold out . " " So-and-so the actress  --  you know what she 's doing now ? Hand-cream commercials . She sold out . " But looking back on it , I did n't feel I was selling out when I took the job at Harrow House . Georgia O'Keeffe had done illustrations for an embroidery company in Chicago in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't it better to earn it at the drawing board , where , at least , I would face daily challenges and choices involving line and color ? And illustrating romantic fictions was a step up , I told myself , from line drawings of thigh-reducing exercises and little bottles of beauty potions . And , as I 've said previously , Williamson , who was art directorin those days , had a way of making it all right . That first day in his office , among the cozy bric-a-brac , he made us each a cup of Lapsang souchong and we talked first of Landsborough ( who had sent me to his old friend " in the trade " ) and then of the nobletradition of book illustration . ( " Why , people looked forward to the drawings by Phiz as much as they did to Dickens ' next installment , " he proclaimed in his reedy voice , his nervous bony hand , prehensile when it came to books , curling behind him to a place on the shelf he knew by heart , plucking out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point .... " Or take Dore : when most of us picture Heaven or Hell , we see his Heaven , his Hell . " ) By the time I left his office with my first assignment , his already cluttered desk was piled high with books : an 1894 edition of Charles Dana Gibson drawings ; a fascinatingbook-length poem called Lucile ( Boston : 1881 ) , with dozens and dozens of high-quality engravings ( including those of an artist listed modestly as T. Cole ) of beautiful women sitting alone at the edge of craggy precipices , or reclining pensively on Victorian chaise longues while earnest and well-dressed gentlemenplied their suits , or of isolated houses swathed in overgrownbrambles and eerily lit by the moon . I could n't wait to get out my paints and add my contribution to " the genre , " as Williamson called it . In fact , looking at my lithographs of " Dark Angels Fly at Night , " he had actually likened my style to that of Samuel Palmer.  |p163At  the time , of course , I did not know that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Compromise was subtly setting in . On the contrary , as the summer wore on I was very much under the illusion of my " progress . " I was always rushing somewhere now  --  down to the art store to pick up more illustrator 's board , uptown to meet Stewart for a tete-a-tete lunch at that dark little pub , or to Michel 's for an evening of fun and games , or to deliver anothermaiden in distress to Williamson , who would give me tea and praise and write out a voucher for two hundred dollars ( in those days ) for me to take upstairs to the business office . Then I 'd head home with another batch of proofs , or sometimes one of Williamson 's own detailed precis , which were little pearls of gothic narrative in themselves , and , on the evenings Landsboroughcame down to me , I 'd often be working when he arrived , my next maiden and her house already sketched in  --  I liked to hear him clump unevenly up the stairs and find me plying my trade as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " plucky girrul . " I was proud of how well I was surviving in this city that was supposed to be so difficult to survive in . I felt like a woman about town with my busy schedule and double life . When the phone would ring I 'd say to Stewart , " I wo n't answer it ; it 's just some woman for my uncle , " when I knew it was Michel ; I 'd explain to Michel I had to " work " tonight , when I was seeing Stewart , remembering how Ambrose had used this same old trick on Sheila . A chunk of the old fickle Clay , that was me ! Also contributingto my illusion of momentum was the lovely false consolationof the deadline . " How soon can you have this ready , Violet ? " Williamson would ask . " I do n't want to stint your quality , but would a week from today ... ? " And I 'd get high on my own sense of importance as I blocked out my third . . . fourth .. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's self-image depends on feedback . I knew , as I cribbed a Norman facade or a sixteenthcenturymanor house from Pevsner 's useful little book , or stood in front of the mirror sketching my fist against my mouth in an attitude of shocked maidenhood , that uptown Williamson waited for this painting , was perhaps even now thinking of me at work on it . Whereas with my fizzled-out " Self-Portrait , " nop164one had anticipated its completion or imagined iCs stages of creation . By August I had grown so accustomed to the unearned accoutermentsat 200 Waverly that I was slightly miffed when Carol 's note arrived announcing their return on such and such a flight at the end of that week . I went out to Kennedy Airport for the second time , this beingadmittedly a more festive occasion ( I had splurged on a bottle of champagne in their honor , lugging it out on the bus in a Bonwit 's shopping bag ) ; it was still in those times when you could stand upstairs on that glass-enclosed balcony and watch people going through customs  --  before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watching so intently for the first sign of Ambrose and Carol that some moments went by before I realized I had looked upon them , opening their bags for customs , and then looked away , not recognizing them . For one thing , Ambrose had on these light-colored , pointy shoes that some minor official of the Mafiosi might wear ; for another , he had grown curly sideburns and put on weight . The two of them were very tanned and had obviously been leading the good life . While Carol was chatting animatedly with the customs official , who appeared to be in a good humor with her , I watched Ambrose . A funny , petulant expressioncrossed his face . His eyes roved round the customs hall as though contemplating escape . Then he tipped back his head and lazily scanned the upper floor . When he saw me , his expressionchanged instantly . Up went the hand in a jaunty wave , one cohort to another . Then he touched Carol on the arm and said something and she looked up and they both smiled and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kissed me . " It sure is good to see you again , sport , " he said . He 'd been drinking on the flight . " Violet darling , at long last , " said Carol , embracing me . She smelled of some very good perfume . She wore a wellcut , open-necked black suit that emphasized her tan ; even the disciplined threads of white in her neat black French twist seemed svelte accessories to her outfit . I fumbled in my Bonwitp165bag and presented her with the bottle of warm champagne . " How sweet , " she said . " Thank you , Violet . Look , Ambrose , champagne for our homecoming . " " Very nice , " he agreed abstractedly , already looking around for a porter . Carol and I followed behind to the taxi rank . " Well , " I said , " how was Italy ? Were n't you a little bit sorry to leave your castle ? " She frowned into the sun , walking crisply along with the awkward champagne bottle , the toes of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was a beautiful three months , Violet , I wo n't deny that , but I 'm very glad to get back . To tell you the truth , I started feeling slothful towards the last . I need my work to complete me , to make me feel I 've used up the day . Are you like that , too , by any chance ? " " Oh , yes . I feel awful when I do n't use my day well . " " You do n't know how happy it makes me to hear you say that . I 'm sure you and I are going to get along . I loved your letters , by the way , with those darling colored drawings of Ambrose'splants missing him . I think it 's good for him to get back , too . New York stimulates people 's drive . Italy 's a bit too full of pasta and all that dolce vita procrastination for my stern Yankee tastes . " Did I detect the beginnings of sourness in those efficient Northern vowels , the first decibel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ambrose 's latest mail out to the airport and he sat in front with the driver reading it while Carol and I sat in the back and I built my initial impression as the hard-at-work ingenue struggling toward a place in the sun . " And you 're able to do a cover a week ? " said Carol approvingly . " I think I 'll probably be able to do two , when my work catches on . I 've just seen the proof of my first painting . It really looks great , even with the four-color process . " " Now , Violet , does your painting get photographed and then separated for engraving , or  --  "  | " Why , that ninny ! " Ambrose burst out . " That thickheaded , uncomprehending boob ! " " Darling , what ? " cried Carol . " Contemptible flunky ! " " Who , Ambrose , who ? " " The mercantile mentality of these people overwhelms me .... " Whose mercantile mentality ? " " That goddamned Rosen , over at Holiday . He wo n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Do n't they ever run out of bosses when they 're too lily-livered to answer themselves ? It seems my article has to make the issue with all the Italian wine ads , or else forget it . As if it has a goddamned thing to do with wine ! " " Well , do n't you still have at least a week on your old extension ? " asked Carol . " That 's not sufficient . Hell , I could have shaped this into something really fine if I 'd had that extra month . " " But would n't it be better to type up what you 've got and hand that in ? " persisted Carol . " Hand it in ' ? Honey , this is n't some inventory report . It 's an in-depth essay about the love affair of the greatest writers in the Western world with a country . " " Pardon my mercantile mentality , " murmured Carol . The color rose on the back of Ambrose 's neck . Then , slowly , he turned and gave her the appealing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Aw , honey , " he said , " let 's not give this cretin the satisfaction of spoiling our homecoming . You do n't want Violet to think we 've started squabbling like old married folks . " He winked at me . " Besides , if I break my back , I think I can probably get something to Rosen by the end of the week . " " We 'll live at my place , for the present , " Carol explained to me . " There 's so much room . It 's one of those rambling old West Side apartments that a whole family can grow up in without getting in one another 's way . I grew up in it . Ambrose will no doubt want his studio outside . A man needs to go out to workp167every morning . " Then , in a conciliatory gesture , she reached forward and stroked Ambrose 's neck with the back of her nails . " I 'm sure you can finish it beautifully by the end of the week , " she said . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apartment . ) The taxi deposited us at a somber , well-kept building across the street from Central Park . An old doorman rushed out at once , wreathed in smiles . " Welcome home , miss ! Or Mrs. , I should say now . " Carol introduced Ambrose and me , and the old man welcomed us . He bustled us all three along to the elevator and while we were going up Carol told us , " Parks has been here ever since I was a little girl . Apparently I once asked Father if Parks was his father . " She giggled , seeming suddenly to shed years in her childhood environs . We got off at the fifth floor , already in a sort of private foyer , with a large oval mirror and fresh flowers arranged liberally in a Chinese vase on a lacquered table . Carol pressed a bell and the door was thrown open almost at once by a tiny brown woman in a black uniform with white apron , who fastened herself on Carol like an appointed fate and began to weep . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awkwardly by while the two women clung and sobbed and alternately patted each other 's backs for several minutes at least . Then Carol straightened up and rather shyly asked Ambrose if he would carry her over the threshold . It seemed a bit ridiculous . I sensed he felt that way , too , but it was done , and once inside , we were introduced to Elena  --  who had also been with Carol for eons . ( She had pressed her thin little lips together and looked the other way disapprovinglywhile her mistress was being hauled over her own thresh-old . ) My experience of city apartments had not prepared me for Carol 's . To me an apartment was by definition transient , a place where you marked time till home came along . But this was clearly home for Carol . Its rooms spread out in all directions , like a house . Its walls and floors were covered in that layered , solid fashion that bespeaks a long , assured residence and the slow ac/cumulation of things for themselves and not because they " go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the factories " and sent away my champagne to be iced , and discussed with Elena which bags were to be unpacked where . " Mr. Clay 's things should go in Father 's old room , Elena . He 'll want his own space to spread out . Also there 's a desk in there . " She brushed past Ambrose , who was standing at the window , looking down into the latesummergreen of Central Park , and murmured playfully in his ear , " If you 're good , you wo n't have to sleep in Father 's room . " Ambrose laughed shortly . " Much obliged , madam . " " Is this a Gifford ? " I asked about the large painting over the beige sofa , a sunset over New York Bay . " No , it 's anonymous , " said Carol , coming over beside me . She had kicked off her shoes and she stood flatfootedly , digging her long , dark-stockinged toes into the thick pile of the carpet . She was completely at home in her own territory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always thought . Definitely worthy of the Hudson River School . However , the little woodsy scene over the mantel is an authenticated early Inness . And later I 'll show you several rather valuable Dutch interiors in some of the other rooms . " " The Grubers are patrons of the arts , " said Ambrose pleasantly , still with his back to us , gazing out the window . Somethingabout the way he stood made me think of a sleek plump panther , testing the view from his new cage . " Minor patrons , " corrected Carol . " And now look at me : I 've married into a family of artists . " " Who 'd better not be minor , if they know what 's good for them , " quipped Ambrose , with a slight edge in his voice , I thought , although I could not see his face . I dozed , on and off , until Albany , where we got a change of drivers . The look-alike blond couple got off at Lake George . As I watched them leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ metal stairs in their thick boots , then squinting purposefullyp169into the sunshine and shouldering their orange packs , I recalled that O'Keeffe and Stieglitz had once had a place at Lake George . I was in her territory . This stimulated me fully awake and I looked out my window with a painterly eye , trying to see the landscape as she might have seen it . But these ranges looked too cool for her , too mythically suggestive , not earthy enough . If I were painting them , I would feel strongly tempted to do a bit of anthropomorphic meddling : they looked so much like morose blue giants lounging torpidly atop the faded noonday green . When the driver announced , " Plommet Falls , request stop only , " over the intercom , I pulled the cord and hurried forward and within seconds found myself in the middle of an abandoned crossroads with a derelict old wooden hotel and a handful of unappetizingstorefronts . I could n't imagine what had made Ambrose want to stop at this desolate little junction . Far from being inspiriting , everything seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Coach Inn , whose porches crumbled and whose chipped Doric columns all bore large warning notices that this edifice was no longer safe ? At least fifty years had passed since the moth-eaten raccoon in the taxidermist 's window had been a threat to any camper 's stores . Next door was a grocer 's , whose window suppliesdid n't look much fresher . Was this the " country store " from which Ambrose had made his last happy phone call to me ? There was a single car in sight , parked in a patch of shade round the side of the old inn . It was a shiny green Gremlin with a HUNTERS PAY FOR CONSERVATION bumper sticker . At first I thought a child was playing some game with me , waving and ducking up and down in the driver 's seat . Then the glass was rolled down and someone sang out , " Yoo hoo ! Violet Clay ? " I recognized the odd , rarefied voice of last night 's telephone call and went over . " I 'm Minerva Means , " said the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet somehow giving the impression of a wizened child peering out at me . She wore a pink cotton pant suit and a matching grosgrain hair ribbon in her surely dyed black hair . For this time of day , for any time of day , she was ludi/crously made up . " Get right in , to the air-conditioning , " she said , " out of this terrible heat , " already rolling up her glass again . I went around to the passenger 's side , thinking how Carol need not have worried about any competition here . The door was locked . She sat behind the wheel , staring straight ahead , a fixed little smile on the wizened face . When I knocked on the window , she gave a nervous start , recalled herself and unlocked my side . " So sorry , " she sang out . " I 'm not quite myself today , dear . This has been an awful shock . Is there any room left back there for your bag ? Slip it on the floor between the seats . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a prisoner has escaped from the big state prison near here  --  or correctional facility , ' as they say nowadays  --  and I 've taken to carrying my valuables with me when I leave the house . " Sure enough , on the back seat of the little car were piled severalfur coats in their plastic bags , a silver tea service , also under plastic , and a stack of leather boxes stamped with fleurs-de-lis . " These days , you have to protect yourself , " she said in her child-pitched voice . " Nobody else is going to do it for you . " She looked me up and down and seemed to approve of what she saw . " Fasten your seat belt , will you , dear  --  otherwise the buzzer will make a racket . " I did so , and she pressed a dainty foot , clad in a white vinyl ankle boot , upon the accelerator , and off we went at a snail 's pace through the desolate little village with its substandard frame houses and ragged lawns sporting various-sized collectionsof @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exactly Beverly Hills , " she said . " I would n't look , if I were you . It will make you all the more depressed . I wish you could have seen Plommet Falls in its heyday . Now it has become a village of mechanics , and mechanics on welfare , at that . Do n't worry , we 'll soon be into the part they can never spoil . I 'm taking you to Mr. O'Halloran 's first . " " I was wondering how my uncle happened to stop in PlommetFalls . Do you know how he happened to pick this particular village ? "  | " Well , dear , as far as I know , he went to Dean 's real estate office down in Schroon Lake . Ever since I had my fiasco with the hippies who burned down my other cabin , I let Mr. Dean handle my rentals . But the moment I spoke to your uncle on the telephone , I felt I would n't have to worry . And then he came up to the house and I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pleasure to rent to him  --  more like having a relative nearby , really . That 's why , when this little Indian from the Meditation Ranch in Schroon Lake started pestering me about a fall rental , I made sure Ambrose did n't want to stay on . I drove up to the cabin to ask him . He was sitting outside smokinghis pipe , that lovely relaxed way of his ; I told him I 'd just come to find out his plans and if there was any chance of him staying on I wanted to get this little Indian guru off my neck once and for all . He laughed and laughed . Then he insisted on bringing out a chair for me and we sat there enjoying the afternoon and talked about all sorts of things . That 's the way he was . Always had all the time in the world for you . He always made me feel so clever and entertaining . Then I said I had to be going and he promised to let me know his plans within the week . Two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was walking with the little girl , Cheyenne , the daughter of the neighbor I was telling you about ... . " " The little girl who actually found him ? " " Yes . I 'm afraid so . Such a terrible thing , her finding him like that . I 'm sure he never meant that to happen . But . . . I was thinking last night , lying awake after the troopers had gone ... who did he imagine would find him ? It was pretty certain to be one of us . And Samantha was much nearer ; she has to use the road that goes right past the cabin . Oh , dear , I just ca n't quite take this in yet . " I somehow could . Not the particulars , but the fact . " But you were saying how he came by your house with the little girl . " " Yes . He said he had thought the matter over and though he 'd been tempted to stay on a while longer he 'd finally decided it would be better to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could count on having the cabin vacated in a week . But Ip172thought you intended to stay till the end of the month , ' I said . Then I felt bad because I was afraid I 'd rushed him off . I told him that , and he put his arm around me and patted me and said , Do n't you think any such thing . Once a person 's made up his mind to leave , it 's better just to go on and do it . My time 's up here . ' That was a week ago today , when he came to tell me that . I do n't know how many times I went over those words last night . Saturday a week ago . And then they walked down my driveway and up the road . The child hung around with him a lot . I just ca n't think how he could have . . . and yet Samantha was telling me  --  I saw her this morning  --  that Cheyenne was acting very stoical about it . But Cheyenne is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own counsel . " " How old is Cheyenne ? " " Let 's see . Eight . No , she was eight when they came here two years ago . She must be ten now , must n't she ? " She gave a high-pitched laugh , sounding not much more than ten herself . " It 's just the mother and daughter . Both of them are very reticentabout the father and I do n't like to pry . My mother always told me if people want you to know something they 'll find a way to tell you . People here assume the child is illegitimate . But I like Samantha . Or Sam , as she calls herself . She 's an excellent neighbor . I suppose you could call her a liberated woman . She can do carpentry and plumbing , fix anything . You should see what she 's done to that old ruin of a hunter 's shack her father left her . Yes , in the two years she 's been with us , she 's made herself quite indispensable around here . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back of that jeep of hers , she 'll repair your gutters , patch your roof . No going on welfare for her . And with an illegitimate child most would . No , Samantha is a good girl . Hard-working . Handsome in her own way , too . " " She sounds worth knowing , " I said , already wondering what she and Ambrose might have been to each other . " Mmm . Now you may look out the window again with pleasure . This is the Plommet Falls that ca n't be ruined . See ? All that on your side is national forest plantation . Is n't it somethingp173the way they put in those pines so straight ? And on my side you have the old family homes . Some live here all year round , like I do , and others open their houses just for the summer months . Of course , when Mother and Daddy were alive , we lived in Albanyin the winter ; we 'd close up the house as soon as hunting season was over . Daddy was quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm sorry to say . Mr. O'Halloran 's father buried my father . Mr. O'Halloran himself took care of Mother . But that was much later . She 's only been gone fifteen years . " The afternoon sun sailed in and out between the tall needly pines with their long , clean trunks . Minerva Means ' beribboned black head barely crested the dashboard as we wound slowly up the steep curved road . The houses , large old brown-shingled boxes , some with Victoriangable roofs , sat aloofly back from the road , protected by rough stone walls or cloaked in thick foliage , offering the occasional , imagination-provoking glimpse into the summer lives of their inhabitants : a glossy magazine turned face down on a green wicker chair ; a man 's bathing suit with white drawstring drying on the wooden railing of an upstairs sun deck . I was reminded of Lewis 's summer cottage in Flat Rock , how as a new bride I had sat on its deck , trying to imagine the lives of the people down below who slowed their automobiles and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a glimpse of my tan shoulders and yellow sundress . " Odd , is n't it , " Minerva was saying , " how undertakers never seem to go into undertaking . They always take over from their fathers . I know you 're going to like Mr. O'Halloran . His wife , Sadie  --  she 's quite a bit younger  --  keeps trying to get me to go to Florida with her . She goes every year . Ca n't stand the cold weather . I 'd like to go . I 've never seen the ocean further down than Cape May . But I ca n't go . I ca n't leave the house . If I went , I 'd just worry about the house all winter . " We turned into a circular shaled driveway . A gleaming black Cadillac was parked in front of the door . The house was square and brown-shingled , like the others I 'd seen on the road , withp174dark-green trim on the windows and door . Only everything was neater here , more visible , the lawn clipped low and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like old lanterns , a little too shiny . A gothic-lettered sign , O'HALLORAN 'S FUNERAL HOME , EST. 1884 , hung over the porch . A bleached-blond lady wearing lots of perfume and a silk print pant suit of turquoise and lavender swirls opened the door . She hugged Minerva , calling her " Minnie Mouse , " and very cordially took my hand in hers and offered her condolences . " Dick 's changing ; he 'll be right out , " she said . " We had ourselvesa few holes of golf , but it was much too hot to play . " " Oh , much , " piped Minnie in her high voice . " Sadie , ought n't I to drive the car round back ? I 've got the coats and silver and Mother 's jewels in there . That escaped convict  --  did you hear ? Everything goes wrong at once , it seems . " " Oh , Minnie , you silly . That was all the way up in Dannemora . You mean to tell me you dragged all that stuff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get a long way in a short time , " said Minerva , her voice wavering a little , like a child who anticipatesbeing balked . " All right , darling , if it makes you feel better , " capitulated the other at once . " You drive it around to the annex . You 're looking very pretty today . I love you in that pink . Violet , would you like to freshen up after your long ride ? Come , let me show you where to go . " Not one word pertaining to death was mentioned over luncheon , which I was given to understand had been prepared for me , after the long trip . We sat outside , on a flagstone patio under a striped awning , amid the fragrance of roses and the splash of a little fountain , and Mr. O'Halloran , a pink-faced man with curly white sideburns , asked polite questions about my life in the city . " I am fond of New York , " he said , " though I have n't been down there in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explained that by " a while " her husband meant1949 . O'Halloran smiled with good nature and said yes , his wife was the traveler in their family ; he himself preferred to stayp175home and potter about the place . " Though I have , " he said to me , " visited Charleston , many years ago . I noticed from his papersthat Mr. Clay was born in Charleston . Were you born there , as well ? " As if by prearranged signal , the women rose and began to clear the table . " Minnie , I want to show you the darling beach outfit I bought last week in Albany , " said Mrs. O'Halloran , pattingher husband 's cheek in passing . Off they went , like two girls , leaving us grownups to serious matters . " I especially loved the grounds of those old churches in Charleston , " went on O'Halloran reflectively . " Let 's see , is n't it St. Philip 's that has the graveyard with the Spanish moss ? And the other one , the one whose bells have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " St. Michael 's , " I said . " That 's one of my first memories , those bells . " " Lovely place , Charleston . Is there , perhaps , a family plot waiting in one of those historic old churchyards where you will wish to bury your uncle ? " Well , well , I thought . For a diplomatic transition , that gets full marks . " I 'm afraid not , " I said . " My grandmother got the last space in our family plot . " I saw no reason to dispel his romantic illusions by adding it was not in either illustrious churchyard . " I really do n't know what the best thing to do is . I do n't recall Ambrose ever expressing any wish about such matters . " " In that case , you must be guided by what you think best , then . You are , I believe , the next of kin ? " " Next and last . " " I see . Well , you be thinking about these things . I will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matters for you , but I should in all fairness inform you that although I 'm the coroner here , there are other funeral directors in the vicinity . There are some papersyou must sign for me after you 've viewed the body , but afterthat you are free to make your own arrangements . " " Oh , of course I 'll stay with you . I would n't want to go anywhere else . " After that nice lunch , how churlish , besides . " I thank you for your confidence . We are the oldest es/tablishment in Essex County . I 'll do my very best for your uncle . Just so you know where we are , the decisions to be made are these , " and he ticked them off on his fingers : " How you wish to put the body away . And then where , of course . And thirdly , what kind of burial service you think would be appropriate . What was your uncle 's religious preference ? " " Episcopal . " As far as I knew , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for my grandmother 's funeral . " The rector down in Schroon Lake is a congenial fellow . We might give him a ring later . You may decide on one of our local cemeteries . Now , do you feel like stepping over to the annex and viewing the body ? It 's quite all right , nothing to be nervous about . " The " annex " sat discreetly behind a row of Norway spruces . It was a remodeled barn , painted a pale yellow , with the darkgreentrim used on the main house . It faced away from the house and had its own parking lot . In a shady area , a young man was hosing down a hearse . The one Ambrose had come in ? " Will it be too cool for you in here ? " asked O'Halloran , as we walked down a dark-tiled hallway . The building was air-conditioned , but I was shivering for other reasons . " No , no , I 'm fine . " " He 's in here , " he said , going first into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A man with a gray beard lay on a trolley , covered up to his chin by a sheet . I was just about to explain to O'Halloran that he 'd made a mistake , but no , it was Ambrose , all right , looking like some saintly ascetic . I 'd never seen him with a beard . It completely changed his looks . Elongated the face . Made him look old . All the white , of course . How strange that the beard should be so much whiter than the hair . Except for a discolored area around his right temple and closed eyelid , he looked serenely untouched . There was something about the mouth that looked prim . . . as if he were congratulating himself on some achievement . " Do ... dead people often look so . . . pleased to be dead ? " I asked O'Halloran , who stood tactfully to one side.  | " There is a certain repose in many instances , " he replied . " It often has nothing to do with the manner of death . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , expecting to die , will often have a surprised look , as if he 's been caught off guard . And sometimes , when the death has been a violent one , the person will look perfectly calm , as though he 'd been carried off gently in his sleep . You recognize your uncle , then ? " " Yes . I did n't know he 'd grown a beard . " " Well , when you 're ready , I 'd like you to step down to my office and sign those papers . Then perhaps we can discuss the other arrangements . " " Why is he . . . I mean , he 's naked under that sheet , is n't he ? Did he shoot himself naked ? " " No , that 's because of the autopsy . He was fully dressed . I have his personal effects for you in the office . " " But why an autopsy ? " " That 's standard procedure in a case like this . Just to make sure . Though , based on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll be anything new to learn . Would you care to be alone with the body for a few minutes ? " " Yes , thank you , " I said . As soon as he had closed the door , I whipped out the small sketch pad I always carry in my purse and stood shivering and sketching the remote new contours of my uncle 's dead face . I knew if I did not , that my memory would falsify this last impression , would retouch it with some of his old roundness , or else exaggerate the new asceticism . If his face at the moment of death had left me any message , I wanted to have it intact  --  or at least as best as my combined hand and eye could catch it . My emotions were curiously in abeyance for the time being . I felt only a taut fascination for this mysterious face . It was so remote from the living man I knew that after I had made the sketch , I was able to push back the hair that O'Halloran had combed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hole . It did n't look big enough to put an end to forty-nine years of pulsing , dreaming life . His dark hair was surprisinglysilky to the touch . The silky hair of the princess , I thought , whose scalp you must get inside , as he told those youngp178writers-to-be at the Pine Hollow School , that long-ago day when he was in his robust prime . Had he any inkling , then , of the dark future he might be creating for himself when he suggested to the little girls they write about something they did n't want to happen , then hurriedly retracted himself ? I gave him one last , long look , knowing that even in his casket I would not see him this way again . Now it was O'Halloran 's turn , an artist by his own lights , to prepare these remains for their finalappearance as " Ambrose Clay . " " I 'll take you up to the cabin now , " said Minerva . We drove up a steep , lonely road with thick pine forest on both sides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daylight . I can leave you there , if you like . You might prefer to pick out his burial clothes on your own . Then whenever you get ready , walk on down to my house and we 'll have some supper . You 're welcome to stay with me as long as necessary . There 's plenty of room . In the old days , when Father was alive , we often had ten or twelve people for the weekend . When we ran out of bedrooms , Mother just put up camp cots on the porches . " " That 's really kind of you . " " Oh , it will be nice to have company . My sister is the only company I ever have , and she 's so busy she seldom gets up from Albany anymore . She 's in real estate . All she ever thinks about is buying and selling property . She 's been after me for years top179put up more cabins ; I 've got the acreage for them , she says , as if that 's all it takes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I worry too much . I worry whether the tenants have left their stove on or if they 're tramping around in their ski boots ruining the wood floors or if they 'll come and do their skiing or hunting and then steal all the furniture and leave in the middle of the night . And everything I worry about comes to pass . That 's the worst part of it . I told you they already burned one cabin to the ground . I knew it was unwise to rent to hippies , but they were rather sweet , a young couple , and so excited about living in the woods . Also , it 's not the easiest thing to find year-round tenants , even when you 've put in electricity and plumbing . Peopledo n't want anything to do with these steep , icy roads . That 's why I guess I must consider myself lucky to have that little Indianguru , though I 'd much rather have gone on with your uncle . Oh , dear . This time yesterday , he was still alive . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a whisk broom . They waved and drove on past because they 'd already said goodbye earlier . They thought he was getting a late start . Later , after supper , on an impulse , Sam sent Cheyenne over to ask if he 'd like to have some dessert with them . This morning she told me she wished she 'd gone herself . " " I 'd like to meet Sam . Do you think she 'd mind if I talked to her ? " " Of course not , dear . She 's sure to have seen a great deal more of him than I did . You 'll have plenty of opportunity . The funeral 's not till Monday , and then you may have to stay a bit longer to settle the estate . You do n't have to be running back to a job , do you ? " " No , I do n't have that particular pressure just now , " I said . It had been a relief to forget my troubles for several hours , to be caught up in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choice of a casket , setting up an appointment with the local rector , telephoning Carol , as promised , to inform her of funeral time and place . The activities surrounding an accomplisheddeath seemed so prescribed and solid next to the greatp180yawning question of my own nebulous future . " I doubt if there 'll be much of an estate to settle , " I said . " As far as I know , Ambrosewas as poor as I am . " " Ah , but there 's red tape , no matter if you 're penniless , " said Minerva . " Forms to be filled out for the Internal Revenue . And there 's the car , do n't forget . You 'll have to have the title transferred , even if you plan to sell it . I do n't expect you 'll want a car in New York . It 's awkward , it being the weekend . The banks and county offices are all closed . Otherwise , you could get a start on matters between now and the funeral . " She sighed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I suppose . As it was , he was more considerate than most . If you could have seen the way he had those things laid out on the table : keys , papers , wallet . That businesslike note stuck in the typewriter , signed by his own hand . Now , that 's my house , through those cedars , to your right . So you 'll know when you walk down again . I could come back for you , I suppose , but I hate to unload all that stuff in the back and then have to load it up again . " " Oh , I do n't mind the walk . It 's been years since I 've been near anything resembling country . " I was straining to see as much as I could of the imposing old hunting lodge with its brown gables and massive stone chimneys . It seemed incongruous , this apprehensive little woman with her child 's voice and pink ribbons , living all by herself in such a dour forest retreat , like some faded Red Riding Hood , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we went , the little green Gremlin puttering in secondgear , till the paved road ended at the bank of a stream . We turned left and began descending cautiously down a badly rutted dirt road . Blue and purple wildflowers grew in profusion . The stream descended , too , rushing alongside us down its rocky bed . We bumped over a loose-planked wooden bridge and Minervasaid , " I must ask Sam if she ca n't do something to steady this . Every time I drive over it , I feel like I 'm going to fall through . Not that I come here all that often . " " This is all yours , then ? All these woods , too ? "  | " Yes , dear . And all the property taxes that go with them . Daphne  --  that 's my older sister , the one in real estate  --  is always after me to put up cabins or sell . But it 's my heritage . I do n't want to see it changed . Daphne and I feel differently about these things . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too much of a realist sometimes . You ca n't buy new memories , I tell her . I 'll never understand how she could sell the old house in Albany . Each of us got a house , you see . She sold hers within a week of her possession of the deed : a lovely old stone house , built by one of the first settlers . It had been in the Means family for a hundred and fifty years . She 's quite content to live in her modern apartment . She goes out dancing every night and dances into the wee hours , but when morning comes , she 's on that telephone making deals . I prefer a more reflective life myself . " I could see her point . The woods , the soft summer afternoon light , were working their charms on me . In such a setting as this , prospects became both exalted and simplified . Minerva said , " I remember when I took your uncle to show him the cabin . Rather , he took me . We rode in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he might be an actor , or some public figure who wanted to getaway for a while . I remember he wore an ascot , a silk ascot . There is something about men with ascots , do n't you think ? I admired him , the way he kept himself up , even when he was here all by himself . That afternoon I was telling you about , when I came to ask about his plans . . . he had finished his work for the day and was sitting outside , dressed so nicely  --  casual clothes , of course , but as though he cared . I was n't crazy about that beard he cultivated over the summer , it made him look too old , but that was his business , I guess . " We bumped through a long patch of shade almost as dark as a tunnel and then took a sharp upward curve back into the sun . To the right was a small log cabin with a green roof , set in a clump of dark spruces . An orange lawn chair faced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Wild lilies grew up around the windows and curled against the screens . Parked in the shade ofp182a pair of old birches was a well-cared-for gray Pontiac , of late sixtiesvintage . Minerva pulled up into the grassy clearing and switched off the ignition . " Well , dear . This is it . " We got out . I could n't believe the quiet . There was n't much breeze , but you could hear it blowing through the lilies . And there was the rush of water from the stream . I was to look upon this scene many times , in a variety of moods , but my first impressionremains as vivid as ever . It was like suddenly coming across a beguiling landscape illustration in an old book  --  the kind of book Williamson used to keep in his office at Harrow House  --  and not knowing without reading the text whether something marvelous or awful was supposed to happen in that setting . And somehow being beguiled by its very ambiguity : the way the light fell at just this time of day in burnt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or was it reassuring ? Had the shadows been put there to emphasize the sunshine , or the other way round ? Of course , something bad had already happened here , but the ambiguity seemed to lie in the scene itself , in both the promise and the warning such a spot would alwayshold out to those who came wanting something of it . It was as if I were seeing the place in the same light that Ambrose had first seen it , when his fate had still been forked . " Was that the chair he sat in ? " I asked . " Yes . It 's almost as though  --  with that chair at just that angle and his car parked under the tree  --  he 'd only gone in for a minuteand was coming right out again . " She unlocked the door and we went in . Bare-looking , but neat and somehow inviting . If I had come twenty-four hours ago , what would I have found him doing ? Packing the two cardboardboxes that stood beside the large brown suitcase with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pockets , his back to me , staring out at the dense woods through the small window above the kitchen sink ? ( A red plastic mug was turned face down on the drainboard . ) Lying on the old horsehair sofa next to the wood-burning stove , or on the narrow pallet bedp183built into the wall , watching the sun make its rounds one last time ? Or perhaps he had sat at the table covered with red oilcloth , looking out the big window , where you could glimpse the stream running past : sat there , his fingers on the keys of the portable typewriter I remembered from Waverly Place , thinkingof what to say in his note . Or had it come to him yet , how he would end the evening ? Beside the typewriter was a key ring and the papers for the car . " It looks much the same as last night , " said Minerva . " Only they 've taken the note . And you 've got the wallet back from Mr. O'Halloran . I saw the things on the table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't want to see . . . I did n't come in until after they 'd taken him away . But Sam saw . He was just there , on the floor beside the couch . Mr. O'Halloran said he lay down first , to keep from falling . " " I wonder if you 'd know . If you fell , I mean . " " Oh , dear , let 's hope neither of us will ever know such a thing , " said Minerva . " His suits and jackets are in that plaid travel bag hanging on the peg by the curtain . Behind the curtain is the bathroom . It 's a comfortable cabin , plain but with the amenities . Sam calls it my softy cabin . ' Her place is a real showpiece , since she 's fixed it up , but they still have an outdoor bathroom . Which is all well and good for two young people living the pioneer life , but you just try and rent a wooden box today without the proper plumbing and electric facilities . I only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Those wall heating units can keep this room warm as toast . But people like the idea of a fire . That 's what happened to my other cabin . The hippies tried to make themselves a stove out of an old oil drum , to save on heating bills . If it had n't been for our excellent firefighting squad , all these woods would have gone up in smoke . Sam put in this stove all by herself , built the chimney and all . She had just the slightest bit of help from the man who delivered it . " " She sounds like quite a girl . " I was more and more curious about this paragon woodswoman . " Oh , I do n't know what I ever did without her . I used top184think it was a man that was missing , when a fuse blew out or the pump stopped or there was some carpentry that needed doing . But it was n't , of course . It was just someone who knew how to do things . " " Where exactly is her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stream , it 's straight down through those trees , just below the waterfall . If you take the road , it 's longer , about a quarter of a mile . It belonged to Sam 's father . He was a sea captain . He 'd come up here by himself whenever he had time off . He was an odd sort , a hermit in his way . I rememberseeing him  --  that was years ago  --  going up and down the hill in an old station wagon , fishing tackle hanging out the back , frowning as though he was scared to death somebody might say hello to him . Poor thing 's in a nursing home now . It was a strange marriage , from what I gather . He was already in his fifties when Sam was born . She never saw much of him as a child . But she apparently does n't hold it against him . Families are interesting configurations , do n't you think ? I 've often thought a family is a whole world by itself . Now , would you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can look around and maybe get his clothes ready to take down to Mr. O'Halloran 's first thing tomorrow ? You wo n't need shoes ; I remember that from my own father . Mother , too , but in her case I insisted . I ca n't bear to think of her without anything on her feet , ' I told him . All her life she complained about her feet being cold . ' " " What time should I come down to your house , then ? " " Whenever you like . I 'll go and see what I can find for our supper . Here 's the key . Do n't forget to lock , will you ? " After she 'd gone , I walked around the cabin . Except for the plastic mug on the drainboard , he 'd pretty much removed all traces of himself . I sat down on the narrow bed and looked through his wallet which O'Halloran had returned to me . Severaldollar bills ( not likely for someone starting on a real trip ) and the honorable discharge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his driver 's license and . . . what was this ? A printed calling card , in Spanish , advertising that Ambrose V. Clay , anp185escritor norteamericano , was available for English lecciones individualeso en grupos . He would also , for a reasonable fee , compose cartas o documentos en Ingles . Had he had any customers ? I wondered , going through his brown leather suitcase . It was not packed as one packs a suitcase to go somewhere . The underclothes had all been stuffed into a transparent plastic bag ; they were n't even folded . Sundry items had been stuffed unceremoniouslyinto the side flaps : pipes , a pair of sunglasses , a new wallet still in its box from a shop in Puerto Vallarta , his passport , some woolen socks , three packets of 9-millimeter ammunition , and a small jewel case containing cuff links and tie clasps . Was that the ammunition a Luger used ? And where was the Luger now , that eccentric-looking weapon he had unwrapped from his handkerchief with a special flourish , that long-ago birthday of mine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boxes had been taped crosswise with masking tape . It was loose . Someone , probably the troopers , had lifted it and looked in , then replaced the tape . As I did now . What had I been hoping for ? The manuscript of the long-promised novel , which I could now take back to town , to vindicate him posthumously ? Some notes , at least , which would expand on the nature of the bankruptcy already declared in his note to me ? I recognizedsome of the books from his old Waverly Place shelves : the novels of Fitzgerald and Hemingway , the dictionary and the thesaurus , his confirmation Bible . . . . There was also a Spanish grammar and dictionary and a history of the Normandy invasion , it looked like . And below these , a couple of copies of Looking for the Lora Lee , which had been out of print now for years . He had kept several dozen copies on his shelf at Waverly Place . Where were they all now ? Had he given them away ? Besides the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wearing a soft pleated dress from the twenties , with her dark hair crimped in the style of that day  --  I remembered that picturealso from Waverly Place ; and the black box with his war medals ; and the inscribed photo from Ava Gardner . I knew that , too.  |p186At  the bottom of the second box were two ioo-sheet packages of Corrasable Bond , one package still unbroken . Not many sheets had been used from the broken package , as far as I could tell . I went into the little bathroom behind the curtain . An oldfashionedtoilet with the tank high up on the wall ; a tub on legs , painted dark green on the outside . Everything clean , not even a hair in the sink . A can of Ajax on the floor . I had to stand on tiptoe to look at myself in the dime-store mirror that had been nailed above the sink . The dense foliage pressing through the tiny screened window gave my face a greenish tinge . I imagined myself living here , week after week , seeing no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Would I see visions ? Would I wake up one day , scrub out the sink and tub , cram all my belongings into the smallest space possible , take one last look at the sun wheeling through the green world and then , with relief , lie down and extinguishmy own flickering lights ? Perhaps , replied my face , suddenly spooky in the greenish shadows . Perhaps if you were a little older than you are now , you would . If you 'd looked into the mirror a few more thousand times , and each time said : You have n't become what you wanted to be and each day now only diminishes your chances and increasesthe mockery of the comparison . I remembered the look Ambrose 's face had given him from the mirror , that time when I sat on his bed , reading the passage about charm . Nine years ago . He 'd just turned forty then . In seven years I would be forty . To get away from such thoughts , I turned with something almost like enthusiasm to the task of selecting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lighted on when I unzipped the plaid clothes bag was the famous hound's-tooth jacket . I took it out and ran my fingers along the durable wool , hearing an impossiblynaive younger self say brightly in the lobby of the MarthaWashington Hotel , " I 've always loved that jacket . It connectsme to the past . " " Maybe that 's why I like it , too , " he 'd bounced back . And all those girls watching us as if we were in a movie , when we floated out into the spring dusk.  |p187Could  you bury someone in a wool jacket in August ? I heard a car approaching . Thinking it might be the wonder woman Sam , whom I very much wanted to meet , I hurried to the door . The car stopped . I poked my face out the screen door . A prim young man with a round butterscotch face got out of a bright-yellow Volkswagen . He wore crisp khaki shorts and his legs were curiously hairless . Across the grass he tripped , in preciselittle steps , in his white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I said . " Hello . Is Mr. Clay here ? " " I 'm afraid not . " " Oh ! I am sorry I could n't get here last night . Something importantcame up . When do you expect him back , please ? " He had some kind of accent . " Well , to tell the truth , I do n't . " " He has already left ? But I see his car is still here . Are you perhaps . . . er . . . ? " " I 'm Violet Clay , his niece . And you ? Are you a friend of his ? " " I 'm sorry , no . I have only met Mr. Clay once . I came on Thursday , to measure the cabin and learn how to operate the stove . But he said it was not convenient . He asked me to come back . We made a date for yesterday at seven , but I was detained in Schroon Lake . Is it all right to come now ? " " Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the new tenant . " " That is right . Conrad Chakravorti . " He held out a plump hairless hand . " Did you say he asked you to come back last night at seven ? " I must have looked odd , or threatening or something , because he went into a long apology about some mixup down at his meditation center .... a speaker had arrived unexpectedly , a day early . " I really do apologize . I have inconvenienced Mr. Clay ? " " Well , I 'm not sure . No , probably not . " A new idea had dawned on me , very much in keeping with Ambrose 's style . He knew someone had to find him , and since someone did , why notp188a perfect stranger ? Why not set up a time for the stranger to return , find what he had to find , and efficiently notify the proper authorities ? This young man looked very efficient . Even at this moment , he was withdrawing a shiny metal tape measure from his pocket . On the other hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he was supposed to , maybe he would have arrived in time to avert the suicide . " Is there something wrong ? " he asked , sensitive to my scrutinyof him . " Well , sort of , " I said , " but there 's no reason why you should n't measure whatever you need to measure . I 'm afraid I ca n't help you with the stove . Miss Means will have to show you how that works . I understand it 's pretty warm without it , though . " I held the screen door for him . He edged diffidently past me , already eyeing the place possessively . It suddenly hit me that I resented his being here and I did n't want him to live in Ambrose 's cabin . I wanted to live here myself . I saw him lookingat Ambrose 's things in the open suitcase . " Mr. Clay killed himself last night , " I told him . He flinched . " Here ? In this place ? " The plump brown fingersclosed tightly around the tape measure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time you were supposed to come . I 'm not saying you could have saved him , but anyway , I thought you ought to know . Since you 're going to live here . You 're not superstitious or anything like that , are you ? " " Oh , no . No ... " He looked up at the rafters as though he expected something might be getting ready to jump down on him . " It 's a nice place . I need a place when the Meditation Ranch closes in September . I am very sorry about your uncle , of course . It is very sad for a man to take his life . Perhaps he was ill ? " " Perhaps . I do n't think so . Go ahead and measure . I 'm just getting some things for his burial . " I shook out a blue oxfordclothshirt . " It 's not too wrinkled , is it ? I mean , he 'll have the coat on over it . And a tie . " He opened his lips to say something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unseemly time . Perhaps I should come back later , after you 've had a chance to remove his effects . " " Well , it might make you more comfortable , " I said . " Why do n't you come back next week sometime ? Late next week . That way , the funeral will be over , and if the troopers need to come up and look around some more , you would n't have to talk to them . Though to keep things clear  --  for yourself , I mean  --  I really think you ought to let them know about your appointment with my uncle last night . " After Conrad Chakravorti drove off , I felt a little ashamed of myself . But not much . After all , I reasoned , something had come over me and I had simply obeyed its demand . And why should he ease right into the space of a dead man without any difficulties ? I had done him a service , in a way , telling him straight out . He was bound to hear it in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live here , he would feel some psychic quiverings sooner or later . After all , meditation was his line of work . No , better to know what he was in for before he committed himself to the cabin . However , I doubted he 'd be rushing down to report to the troopers about his unkept appointment with Ambrose . Why ask for trouble ? I was pretty sure he had alien status . I locked up the cabin . Already I had second thoughts about my " impulse . " Now that Chakravorti had gone , I began to thinkp190maybe whatever had come over me had n't been a genuine desireto live here myself so much as it might have been a desire to keep a stranger from meddling with the atmosphere until I could finish drawing from it whatever messages Ambrose 's living and dying here had left behind . Frankly , I was n't sure I had it in me to live in a place like this all by myself for very long . How would I deal with so much unstructured time ? Could I make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in town ? And what if I could n't ? What excuses would be left me ? For years , I 'd had one or another escape clause to put between me and my .. . what ? Sloth ? Faintheartedness ? Self-indulgence ? Fear of failure ? There 'd always been either a man or a job to blame for keeping the precious energies dissipated . Ambrose may well have found himself in this predicament . Before I started the trek down to Minerva 's , I went and sat in the Pontiac for a few minutes . It was very tidy , not even any of the dust you always see on people 's dashboards . But then , according to Minerva , who 'd had it from Sam , he 'd cleaned it out with a whisk broom yesterday . For whom ? For me ? Or for the same reason that my grandmother used to keep her drawers in order ? ( " If I die , I do n't want people going through my underwear and things and casting aspersions on my personal habits . " ) He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the driver 's side . The sight of them brought home to me , more than anything else , how recently he had been alive . So this was now my car . My license had expired almost as many years ago as this car was old . It had been Lewis who made me learn to drive . He could n't believe that a twenty-two-year-old American woman had never bothered to learn to drive . " Somebody may not always be there to pick you up and take you where you want to go , " he 'd said . The time Ambrose had come to speak at our school , Pequeiia Bombal and I had followed him out into the waning afternoon to see him off . All by itself in the school parking lot crouched a sleek foreign car with a snarling animal 's head on the hood and plush red bucket seats . I almost burst with pride . " Is that yours ? " I asked  | " No , actually it belongs to a good friend of mine , " he said , " but when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 's impractical to keep a car in New York City . " " Oh ! May we Beet in it ? " cried Pequena , jumping up and down  --  overdoing the jeune fille enthusiasm even for an eightyear-old , I remember thinking at the time . " Well , sure , " said Ambrose , smiling at her . " You two go ahead and both sit in it for a minute if you like . " She made a beeline for the driver 's side and I rather sourly climbed into the passenger 's seat . While she was pulling and pushing various knobs , comparing the dashboard setup to her father 's Mercedes , Ambrose looking in on us benevolently , I spotted a light-green angora cardigan with pearl buttons balled up carelessly in a heap on the shelf behind the seats . I could n't have been more shocked if I had suddenly turned around and seen a soft green snake curled there . Pequena chattered on , animatedby all the attention she was getting . That night after lights out , her accented voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , what do you bet he has a meestress ? " " What makes you think that ? " Had she seen the sweater ? " Because my father has one . It is all right . He is a widower . All men who are successful have them . It is the way of the world . You know what else I bet ? " " What ? " I did and did n't want to know . " I bet he and his meestress are spending the night together in a motel right now . " " You do n't know anything , " I said , thinking of the soft green sweater tossed carelessly down . Where had she waited for him , then ? In town ? It somehow spoiled the whole day , such a thought . What exactly was a meestress ' ? I left the car and started walking back down the road toward Minerva 's . It would be nice to have somebody fix supper for me . It was lovely to be in the open air , in the woods , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alert , considering I had n't gone to bed at Milo 's till after two , not to mention the drunken binge before . My angle of vision had shifted withinp192these last hours to make me see how narrowly I had been living my life , if you could call it living . Was that me , yesterday at this time , juicing up on Stolichnaya , in that shadowy apartment ? How depressing ! I stood on the rickety wooden bridge and looked down at the stream hurrying over the flat , oddly shaped rocks . I saw white cutouts beneath a thin wash of viridian green : Arp-like geometry , with a touch of Ryder 's romanticism to soften the hard edges . As a painter , I had never , for any period of time , submergedmyself in nature . If I did do so , which way would I go ? Would she overwhelm me into making slavish replicas of her creations ? Or would her creations offer themselves as guides towardmy own inner shapes ? The latter , I hoped , but how could I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paved road that led down to Minerva'swhen a large white jeep came roaring uphill . It slowed at the last minute before the road dead-ended at the stream , and the driver , a deeply tanned woman with long braids of an uncannysilver color , executed a hairpin turn to the left with the ease of one who drove this route regularly . Beside her was a young girl with an aureole of pale fuzzy hair and wide , curious eyes . She turned round in her seat to look at me as the jeep bumped off , down the rutty road up which I 'd just walked . The driver herself had afforded me only the briefest of glances . My uncle 's neighbors ? Undoubtedly . How many handsome women with girl children would be likely to drive down this particularroad with the reckless expertise of habit ? Besides , Minervahad mentioned the jeep and the handsomeness . The woman who chopped wood and brought it to her customers , patched roofs , fixed gutters : who was she ? My curiosity was all the more piqued from having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her ? If I knew him , he 'd had a try at something . Had she responded ? If so , how did she feel today ? Her face had shown nothing , but why should it ? For all she knew , I was just a weekend hiker , wandering the woodsy roads . Fantasizing on the many possibilities that might lead ap193young , attractive woman to live in a remote spot such as this , bringing up a child in a cabin in the Adirondacks , I ambled through the remainder of sun and shade , admiring the little blue daisies and goldenrod that shot up in such profusion . I rememberedmy old violets-and-burdocks painting and wondered if Mr. Green was still alive , still gallery-sitting for his son on odd days , or whether both the old man and the gallery had gone the way of my lost nine years . That little painting  --  where was it ? Stashed away with my other apprentice works somewhere in the cramped studio from which so many damsels in distress had been eked  --  questionably  --  into life , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their future homes into a cobalt-bluenight I could mix in my sleep . I had never sent to Lewis for the larger paintings left behind in his basement . By now his new wife , the mother of his twins , had no doubt discoveredthem and dispatched them where ? To the annual school or church bazaar ? ( In an aside to a close woman friend , as she set them up against a box hedge : " Lewis 's first wife , you know , fanciedherself a painter . She went off to New York to make her name , though nothing has been heard from her since . There was one I obviously could n't bring : a nude of Lewis , smoking his pipe . He was so skinny in those days ! I had to cut it out of the stretchers with the boning knife , so it would go in the garbage can . I saved the wood , which was still perfectly good . " ) Minerva 's lodge had a certain brooding aspect that , had I not been fired yesterday by Doris @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sketch pad and jot its lineaments for a future cover . It had the gothic gloomy grandeur , all right . The weatheredbrown shingles . The gabled windows . The giant stone chimneys . But more important : the air of desolation about it , the ghosts of better days hovering in the flower beds gone to weed , the stone deer with a broken antler standing proud and neglectedon the patchy lawn , the rustic porch furniture that looked as if it had stayed outside for many seasons of rain and snow and had long ago given up any hopes of ever being sat upon again . There was a queer little stained-glass window to the rightp194side of the door , with a red rose enclosed in a yellow circle , insidea pine tree which dwarfed all but the edges of a blue sky . I pushed the bell but heard no ring , so knocked lightly on the colored window . Through it I watched Minerva emerge , as if from under water , a small timid shape , now in blue , with a touch of matching blue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undone after she had called through the door to make sure it was me . " Come right in , dear . I 've already brought in your bag . My , you were up at the cabin quite a while , were n't you ? " She was wearing some kind of wispy at-home wrapper , vaguely Orientallooking , white dogwood print against a sky-blue background . The white vinyl boots had been exchanged for black ballet slippers . In the soft brownish interior light of the lodge , she seemed eerily younger , a diminutive eternal maiden , hermetically sealed behind the four walls of her parents ' old summer retreat . " You had a telephone call , " she said . " A man from the BCI called , from their headquarters up in Saranac . About your uncle . Routine , he said . I told him he could reach you later tonight . One good thing . He told me that runaway prisoner had been apprehended . So we wo n't have to worry about him to-night . " Nevertheless , she rebolted the bolt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handed over the key to the cabin and decided I might as well tell her about Conrad Chakravorti at once . " Well , " she piped in her ethereal voice , " I suppose he had to know . It had crossed my mind that such a thing might put a potential tenant off . And those Indians believe in reincarnation , do n't they . " We stood in the vast , high-raftered room , from whose dark walls a large assortment of stuffed creatures gazed down at us out of stoic , glassy eyes . She gave a resigned little sigh . " I can always resort to Mr. Dean 's real estate office again , " she said . " He may be able to come up with someone for the winterif Mr. Chakravorti begs off . After all , he did find me your uncle , Mr. Dean did . And looking on the bright side , all thosep195curry dishes he 'd probably cook would stay in the walls for years and put off the desirable summer people . " " I was thinking , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ devotingmyself totally to my painting . So if by any chance the cabin does become available , I might be interested . " " Would you ? In spite of everything ? Though ... why should n't you ? After all , I live in this house where my own mother died . She 's still here , in a sense . Her ashes , I mean . It 's a very solid little cabin . And I showed you the units , did n't I ? On the really cold nights you might want the stove , just to providethat extra bit of coziness . More of a security than a necessity . I shall certainly keep you in mind , dear , if Mr. Chakravorti falls through . Though if he still wants it , I suppose I must honor my word . That 's only fair . " " Of course , " I agreed , deciding to leave it at that . Not commitmyself yet . See what would happen . I looked round the big brownish room , furnished in the strangest mixture of fussy antiqueand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rough-hewn crossbeams ; a collection of old fans in a glass case guarded by a stuffed white owl with outspread wings who looked as if he might take off any minute from his wall perch . There were several hulking cupboards made entirely of varnished twigs and displaying both porcelain figures and guns . But from whatever angle you happened to look up , some large bird or animalhead looked back down . There was a wall coatrack , made of one long row of upturned deer hoofs . Minerva surveyed the animals possessively , with a certain tenderness . " Father was an avid hunter , " she said . " He was n't just a careless killer , like some are today . He liked to say he 'd had an encounter with each of these animals . When he prepared for the hunt , he would begin thinking about the animal he was going after . . . that white-tailed buck , for instance . . . or the wolverine there . Or even "  --  she daintily toed a frowzy bear rug with her ballet slipper  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been at you again this summer . He would concentrate , Father would , until he could feel the movements of thep196animal 's mind . It was almost like a love affair between them , right to the end , he said . " " Fascinating place , " I murmured . It was . Mother 's ashes and Father 's stuffed soul mates , and this childlike old woman in her glad rags and matching hair ribbons , living out her days in a sepia wash of family history . " Thank you , dear . I wish you could have seen it in its heyday . I try to keep things as they were , but I lack my mother 's touch . She was an artist when it came to her own homes . If she put the simplest meal on the table or arranged a few flowers in a vase , it became a creative act . They say these talents always skip a generation . My sister Daphne ca n't boil an egg properly , and it 's certainly so in my case . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the waningsummer light and dined , in the company of the best linen , china and hefty old silver , upon a meat and squash casserole still partially frozen at the center . " Oh , dear , " said Minerva . " I think maybe I ought to have left this in a little longer . " " It 's very tasty , " I said , sipping some water from a cut-glass goblet . " That 's kind of you . What I do is , I make up a dozen or so at a time . Then I do n't have to bother to think of what I 'm going to eat every night . If I had thought of it , I would have asked Sam for one of her lettuces , from her garden . We could have had a salad . " " This is fine . I think I saw Sam . Very tanned , with silverlookingbraids , driving a white jeep ? " " That 's her . Still so young to have gone completely gray . You wonder she does n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instinctively to her own jet-black coiffure . " But anything of that sort would probably be against her principles . " " What are her principles ? " " Oh , she has n't enumerated them for me , or anything like that . She 's not a great talker . Takes after her father , I guess . She talks more than he ever did , of course , but that 's not sayingp197much . And she 's in a different position than he was ; she has to earn her living from the people here . When I said her principles , I mean only what I 've observed about her . We 've had minimalsocial contact . When she arrived , I invited them down for supper as a neighborly gesture . She never invited me back . But she was quite nice that time . She asked all sorts of questions about the area . They 'd been living down in Florida , with the father ... Sam 's father , I mean ; she 's been close-mouthed as a clam about the child 's father . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't even know what she was doing for a living till the Newkirk sisters over on Witch Tree Road told me they 'd answereda general handywork ad in the Plommet Falls Pennysaver , for someone to trim their trees , and even when they talked to her on the phone they thought she meant her husband was coming . When she showed up , they did n't feel they could discriminate on the basis of sex . It was a matter of principle with them . And then when she did such a good job , they asked her if she could do carpentry work and she built them the cleverest little house for their outdoor cats , with insulated walls and separatelittle sleeping berths and a swinging door so that they could go in and out . Since then , she 's had all the work she can handle . Word gets around . Especially if the Newkirk sisters have anything to say . " " I wonder where she learned to do all those things . " " Out west somewhere , she told the Newkirk sisters . She and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of commune . Though she is n't your typical hippie . Nor your typical feminist , either . The only time she 's ever made any sort of fuss like that was when the principal at Cheyenne 's school would n't let her take beginner 's shop . Sam went to the president of the school board  --  she 'd just done a big shingling job on his barn  --  and convinced him that a little girl living in a cabin in the woods needed to know how to use a hammer and saw more than she needed to learn to cross-stitch tea towels . Now Cheyenne 's made herself a little dressing table for her room , and when she was down here with your poor uncle the other day , when hep198walked down to say he would n't be keeping the cabin , she told me four of her friends were signing up for shop this fall . I just hope what happened last night , and her finding him like that , wo n't mark her in any way . Though Sam said she seemed to be taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cool little thing . Would you like a cup of Sanka ? It 's only instant . I do n't keep coffee for myself or I 'd never get to sleep . " " I 'd love some Sanka . " We rose together in the thickening gloom and I helped her clear away our few dishes . Minerva was obviously not a person to turn on a lamp till she fell flat on her face in the dark . In the murky , none-too-clean kitchen , she put on water to boil and got out two exquisite cups and saucers . " What a brave girl you must be . Do you live all alone in New York ? " I told her I did , which was now true . " And you 're an artist ? " Her face tipped up to me , and in the semidarkness I could see how she had looked at my age . " Mostly an illustrator , these past few years . " " That must be exciting . My sister Daphne lived in New York for a while when she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stay once . I was going to take voice lessons . But I got sick and had to come home . " " Oh , too bad . " " I 'm not sorry . I saved myself a lot of time and disappointment . And I 've enjoyed what little gift I have . When Mother and Father gave their entertainments , I would do a bit of Schubert , or the aria from Gianni Schicchi . The response was always rather gratifying , if I do say so myself . And when Mother was ill , during her last years , I am so grateful I was able to give her pleasure . I often sang her to sleep . " We returned to the table and sat sipping our muddy nightcapsfrom fine china . The last bit of greenish light was fast disappearingin the sky outside . " Was n't it . .. about this time last evening ? " I asked . " You know , that he . . . "  | " Yes , dear , about now . But it does n't do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She cocked her head shyly . " Would you like me to give you a little song or two ? It 's all I have to offer in place of dessert . " " I ca n't think of anything I 'd like more , " I said , disarmed . " Let me see . I do n't think I 'd better try any of the arias . I have n't practiced in quite some time . Shall I sing a few of Mother 's favorites ? " " By all means . " She took a last gulp of Sanka and sat up very straight and stationedher hands , singer style , in her lap . Her pale face , which seemed to float in the preternatural greenish light , took on a rapt expression . With the voice of a young angel , she began to sing : My Mother and Father are deep in the graveAnd I 've given to the poor what they told me to save ... After I got over the shock of that pure and beautiful voice welling out of this fusty old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told . It was real bathos . Lovelessness , poverty and despair . Doubled and tripled , verse by verse . Yet when death rescuesour poor heroine , who despite all , never loses her virtue , I felt a lump in my throat . I was on familiar emotional ground . After that came one about a little matchgirl named Dot . Sobbing , shivering with the cold , All her matches yet unsold ; Visions of a cheerless garret , Cruel blows not soon forgot ... and the refrain : " oh , I 'm only little Dot . " Whether Minerva was a born performer wasted away in these woods or whether she simply happened to identify passionatelywith victimized young girls , I found myself extremely moved . The back of my neck tingled and there was such a fairy/tale atmosphere in the room that I half expected to see the heavy-antlered deer and the fierce white owl and the motheatenbear begin to weep in concert , real tears rolling from their round glass eyes . After that came " Mary of the Wild Moor , " who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " Father , oh , pray let me in , Take pity on me , I implore . . . But the wind is howling so loudly her father hears nothing . Oh , how must he have feltWhen he came to the door in the morn ; There he found Mary dead , and the child Fondly clasped in its dead mother 's arms , While in frenzy he tore his gray hairs .. . This one almost did me in . The father part , I think , combined with Minerva 's sweetly plaintive rendering . Sobbing waifs and life 's cruel blows : Minerva 's mother seemed to have had a sweet tooth for all the ingredients that made up what Jake used to call my " Poor Little Me jags . " There was then one that made me think of my own mother . Sung from the point of view of a policeman : Many a young girl I have saved From a dark and watery grave While walking the streetsAt night on the job .. . If he had been patrolling the East Battery that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Would I like it any better than where I was ? At my urging , she sang an encore , " The Pardon Came Too Late , " which showed that men could have problems , too . It had an irresistible melodramatic refrain , which we ended up singing together : A tear , a sigh ; alas , goodbye ! The pardon came too late.  |p201At  about the ninth refrain , we both started to giggle . I felt we were the same age . Then the phone rang , and Minerva stumbledthrough the darkness , feeling for the light switch . It was the inspector from the BCI , making his routine inquiries about what might have caused Ambrose to take his own life . A few minutes of his " routine " questions ( he sounded as though he was reading them off a prepared sheet ) and the spell of the evening was broken . With my help , Ambrose was being turned into a statistic . The inspector used the phrase " pretty clear-cut " several times , and said he had hoped to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Saranac , two CB-ers arguing over their radios , now both in critical condition . I could tell from his voice he thought the CB case was more interesting than Ambrose'ssuicide . I asked him what had been done with my uncle 's Luger . " It was kind of special  --  he got it on Normandy Beach . I 'd like to have it back . " " Highly unlikely you 'll get it , " he said . " The troopers usually destroy the weapon in a case like this . " " Even if it was a family memento ? You mean they wo n't returnhis property to me ? " I heard him sigh . Probably dying to get this over with . " Maybe if they took out the firing mechanism , " he said . " Tell you what . Why do n't you give Lieutenant Quentin a call ? He was on the case . Better yet , stop by state police headquarters at Schroon Lake and see him . Big redheaded guy . Very amenableto the ladies , so I understand . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 've investigated a lot of suicides in my time . Fact is , it 's rougher on the survivors . There was a man in Keene Valleynot long ago . Shot himself because his trucker 's license had n't been renewed . His widow said to me , It 's like someone asking you a question and then not staying around to hear the answer . ' " " We 'll track Lieutenant Quentin down tomorrow , " said Minerva . " And if he 's not on duty Sunday then we 'll get him Monday , before the funeral . It 's the nice young trooper who wasp202here last night . I love their outfits . They remind me of Canadian Mounties . Of course you should have the gun back if you want it . " She waved her small hand at one of the hulking cupboards made of twigs . " I have all of Father 's firearms . Not that I 'd know the first thing about loading a single one of them . Now I think we ought to turn in . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where I 've put your bag . You 're in Mother 's room . " She led me down the hall from the big room . When I 'd visitedthe bathroom earlier , marveling over the wooden toilet tank with the tiny gold knob you pushed down to flush , I had peeked into a half-opened bedroom door and wondered who would sleep among so much white organdy . " This is my room , " she said , seeing me slow down as we passed it . " Would you like to see it ? " We went in and she switched on a ruffly lamp . It was a veritablevirgin 's bower , white flounces everywhere , on window curtains , dust ruffles , the canopy over the bed ; even the princess telephone and the portable TV were white . Framed over the old brick fireplace ( also painted white ) was a reproduction of Lawrence 's " Pinkie , " flanked by assorted family pictures . A wistful adolescent frozen forever in a brown vignette peered out of an oval frame . Minerva 's hair was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ below the ear lobes , with bangs . " It 's a very feminine room , " I said . " It must be fun to sleep under a canopy . It must feel so secure . Hey , wait  --  here 's one of my covers . " Stacked on the lower shelf of Minerva 's cane bedsidetable were at least fifty dog-eared gothics , with Conspiracy at Thorncroft right on top . I picked it up . " Not one of my best , " I felt compelled to admit . Though there was no use admitting the rest of the shameful truth : how the house the girl was stumblingaway from in her too tight gown had been copied from the Penguin cover of The Woman in White . At the time , I think I had been in a hurry to go away with Jake for the weekend somewhere . Minerva was bowled over . " But ... I 've just finished this ! You mean you . . . ? What a coincidence . To think I lay in thisp203very bed . . . I often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel closer to the character if I have a clear impression of her looks . I particularlyenjoyed this book . My goodness ! I wonder if . . . would you mind autographing it , just inside the cover ? Yes , here are your initials , at the base of that old tree ! ' V.C. ' Well , I declare ! " Feeling a bit ridiculous , I signed : " To Minerva Means , with many thanks for the hospitality of her house . Violet Clay . " Across from my signature the blurb read : " Years ago they had robbed her of her wedding . Now they were trying to arrange her funeral . " " I shall treasure this , " she said . " You are the first real artist I have ever known personally . " " Now that I think of it , " I said , " you are the first reader of these books I 've ever met personally . " " Come , you must be tired , " she said , with a touch of new respect . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hall . I existed now as an artist for her . Yet if I had told her I had a onewomanshow currently running at Knoedler 's or the Tibor De Nagy , she would have been unimpressed . Mother 's room was as ponderous and red as daughter 's had been flouncy and white . It was more of a Victoriana museum than a bedroom , with the heavy red draperies and **25;4768;TOOLONG and velvet lampshades with black fringe . My suitcase had been laid across the arms of a bishop 's chair . The high , rather narrow bed , also covered in red , had been turned back for me , though I began to doubt how much sleep I would get in here . Directly opposite the bed was the largest and most outlandish of the twig cupboards I 'd seen yet , its shelves crammed full of family photographs in frames of every size and material  --  including several in a sunburst design , also made of the ubiquitous varnished twigs . As I saw Minerva looking round with the unrestrained satisfaction of a faithful curator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot of interesting furniture ! Especially these enormous old cupboards made out of sticks . " " Depend on an artist to single out the most sought-after thing in the entire house . I 've just about made up my mind top204promise this to the Adirondack Museum . All the cupboards were made by a caretaker of ours , Bob Jarvis . A real old-timer . He would make furniture for us when he stayed here during the winter months , looking after things . Each spring , he 'd surprise us with several new pieces . Father used to say , I wonder what monstrosity old Jarvis will have waiting for us this time . ' But Mother was fascinated by the craftsmanship and insisted Bob Jarvis teach her how to do it . It 's a type of rustic furniture completelyindigenous to the area . Mosaic twigwork veneer . This cupboard has three kinds of maple in it , two kinds of birch , and ash , beech and wild cherry . Those lower doors carry the design of the rose inside of the pine  --  that was my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ window put in both houses , with the sign of the rose inside the pine , when they were married . " " What a lovely idea . I noticed the window on the porch . But this cupboard must have taken months to make . " " Oh , it did . But the winters up here are long . When you 're alone , if you do n't have a project , Bob Jarvis used to say , you 're a sitting duck for cabin fever . We once had a caretaker who went stark raving mad . Took his shotgun and went down to the foot of the hill and started shooting at snowflakes . Of course , Daphne is furious that I wo n't promise her this cupboard . I do n't know what makes her think she 's going to live forever ; she 's older than I am . But she 'd just sell it , if she did outlive me . If it goes to the Adirondack Museum , there will be a metal plaque on it foreverthat will read : Gift of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reverently along the side of the big old cupboard , clearly in her element and loath to leave . " And there we all are ... , . There 's Mother  --  was n't she beautiful  --  and there 's Father with a buck he just shot . That was taken up at the cabin , in the days when it was just a lean-to . And here we all are sitting on the front porch . Mother made that frame out of witch hobble and shadbush twigs , after Jarvis showed her . Now , Violet dear ... when Daphne sleeps here , she always makes me remove this urn to my room ... "  |p205On  the bottom shelf was a pompous-looking porcelain urn , set on a golden pedestal and painted with garlands of roses . The lid was fastened down with wire clasps . I guessed what was inside. " ... which I gladly do , " Minerva went on . " Daphne would get no sleep otherwise . Her guilt would haunt her in the presence of our mother 's remains . Daphne knew she ought n't to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must n't bore you with family problems . The question is , if you would feel more comfortable .. . " " I do n't mind , " I said . " It 's her room , after all . " I swallowed a yawn and suddenly realized I was bushed . " You are a sweet girl . And I ca n't get over the coincidence of that book cover ! Well , dear , I 'll let you go first in the bathroom . It 's comforting for me to have someone in the house . I sometimes lie alone and imagine . . . Well , I told you how my father would think about the animal he was going out to hunt . I imagine someone out there in the night , like that escaped prisonerthey 've just caught . I 've often thought a criminal could feel me , waiting and frightened , a perfect victim . And my own fear could lead him , like a kind of ESP , right to this house . " I met her once more as I left the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and had lifted her hair into a dark topknotwith a white ribbon . Well , at least she 'd be dressed for him if he ever got in . " Good night , dear . " She offered up her cheek to me , somewhat in the fashion of a beloved bride . " Sleep as late as you wish . " I got undressed and climbed into the high bed . The sheets were not as fresh as Milo 's had been the night before . Had they been changed since Daphne 's last stay ? Poor Daphne , unable to sleep with the urn in the same room . My own mother was buriedin Anderson , South Carolina . My father had been attending Clemson when he met her . Her father was foreman in a cotton mill . Once my other grandparents came to visit me at boardingp206school . They had been to Chimney Rock , they said , and thought they ought to look in . I remember my relief at its being just beforeEaster . Most of my friends had already left for vacation . I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her father was picking us up late , on his way back from somewhere . I walked the ill-at-ease old couple up to the athletic field because I knew it would be deserted . He wore white socks with a brown suit and kept turning his hat round and round by the brim . She spoke in whispers , as though she were in church . On the way back to their shabby car , he took out his wallet and handed me a five-dollar bill . " If you ever want to come stay with us , you just call , " he said , going suddenly red and angry . " Now , Dad , " she admonished , " watch your pressure . " " Well , I do n't give a damn . She 's Liza 's child after all . Why should n't she come and see her grandparents ? " " She will , when she 's older . We ca n't give her the advantages . You 'll come when you 're older , wo n't you , VioletIsabel ? She favors Liza , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her shiny black purse for a handkerchief and began to sniffle . " Now , Mother , you promised if I brought you , you would n't . " Was I relieved when they finally climbed back into their dusty coupe and drove out the school gates ! In my dutiful seasonal greeting cards and rarer letters to them , I habitually concluded , " One of these days , I 'm coming to see you , wait and see ! " But they died before I could honor my promise , he first , of a stroke , she some years later of a kidney infection . Whenever I thought of them , my mother 's " people , " as my Charleston grandmother would have said , I felt sad for them that their only grandchild had not been more of a joy to their last years ; I had a hard time , however , thinking of that grandchild as myself . " I 've often thought a family is a whole world by itself , " Minerva had said . I was not of their world . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ More than anything , I had been in the habit of thinking for years , I existed as a world unto myself : the privilege of an orphan . To be used when necessary to prove underprivileged status , as Jake had pointed out on that day of truth when we were both going for the jugular.  |p207Well  , my last vestige of family had wiped itself out last night . Up till this time I had been partly formed by the family presencesin my life ( as well as by their more extended absences ) ; but as of now , I would have to consider my heritage complete . A few stray memories might still be holding out on me , but the returns that went with being a Clay were , for the most part , in . I was as alone in the world as Minerva . Only there would be no ancestral fortress for me to hide out in daintily , drawing my consolationsfrom its hoards and shadows , dressing and undressing myself in front of comforting old mirrors that still bore my child 's imprint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ create my own fortress soon , my ravagers were going to be more pitiless than any anticipated thief or prison escapee . On such a note I turned off the fringed lamp and lay in a darkness so thick it smelled old . I was not in the least disturbed by the " presence " of Mrs. Means . August as she had appeared in her photographs , she connected me with no memories , fears or guilts . For a time , I lapsed into a sort of attentive suspension , watching the movies on the insides of my eyes , those retinal afterimages that often follow an active day . I saw acrobats , speeding cars , lonely blue landscapes , the imprint of an emperor 's , no , Ambrose 's face on an old coin . At some point , my own " hand " took over and I began to control these images , to a degree . I often draw or paint on the verge of sleep ; I fill empty spaces with abandon , the images appearing always a little ahead of my brush @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marvel at my own facility and wonder why I ca n't carry over this gift of inspired recklessness , the disinvoltura that Vasari so admired , into the daytime world when I have real brush and tangiblesurface in front of me . I feathered in a gypsy caravan with quick watery-brown brush strokes , in the calligraphic style of Daumier 's Don Quixotes . It had stopped right on top of a barren hill . I painted a curtainin the side of the caravan . It was open , as if for a show . And in the center lay a woman strapped flat on a kind of pallet bed . Then a little girl appeared in front of the caravan and a crowdp208gathered below her . I painted the backs of their heads , the tops of their old-fashioned hats . I was behind them , waiting to see what would form next . The child opened her mouth and began to sing . I could n't hear the words , but supplied some of the sad verses from Minerva 's songs . I was , you understand , awake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to an extent , guide their progress . Then the scene became animated . The crowd threw coins into the child 's skirt . They were much moved . The poor little thing had to hold on to her skirt for dear life as it grew heavier and heavier with the weight of coins . Suddenly the mother broke her straps ; they came flying away like cooked spaghetti . She swelled up and sort of poured out of the caravan and began to envelop the crowd . Soon they were knocking around inside her like toys inside a cloud . The little girl struck up another song ( this time I myself created the words : " Sad as sad can be . . . that 's little me , oh ! little me " ) . Then the whole thing speeded up like a movie run too fast ; it took on a comical air , as well : the little girl turned into a helium-balloon figure and floated up into the sky , where she soon joined the others , most of whom turned out to be plump @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a time by the effortless process in which my serious beginning had turned into a painted soap opera and finallya child 's cartoon , until I finally got bored with my " creation " and wiped it out by simply opening my eyes . " I 'm really tired of all this old stuff , " I said . It was less dark now . I could make out the outlines of two windows and the hulkinggreat twig temple to Mother 's ruins . But it was n't that old stuff I meant I was tired of . Soon I was drowsing , this time doing a superrealistic paintingof an old woman in bed . I worked small areas in a deliberate , craftsmanlike way , using smooth sable strokes to keep me from cheating on the small details . I did every piece of fringe on her lamp , highlighted every greeny-blue vein in her old hands folded formally upon the counterpane . The old masters worked like this , I reminded myself . No impressionistic shortcut or splashy impasto . Just solid , slow attention to each matter at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revealed . Then this " painting " also degenerated into a scenario . Two masked figures dressed in black rubber , like deep-sea divers , entered the old woman 's room . " What are you going to do ? " I heard myself croak as they approached me with menacing gestures . Then one of them made ready to part my legs while the other brandished a poker . I struggled either to wake or to scream . " Relax , " said one . " We 've only come to clean out your fireplace so you can build a decent fire . " Somewhere a phone started ringing . " Hell , " I said , turning the fringe lamp back on . " Do n't tell me this room 's getting the better of me , after all . " It was reassuringto hear Minerva 's high-pitched voice conversing with someone . She talked for some time , first in a questioning , then in a cajoling tone . Her sister Daphne , perhaps ? I got up and opened the thick red curtains . The window was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forehead against the screen . A half-formed moon floated above the conical tips of the cedars . Then I went back and turned off the lamp and waited to see if there would be more light . There was . A luminouspatch of night graced the lower part of the bed . Try , try again . I lay down and , as a sort of litany toward sleep , went over the things I still had to do for Ambrose : the funeral clothes to O'Halloran , the visit to the rector , tombstone could n't be orderedtill Monday morning , flowers . . . . Carol was providing the wreath through the local florist ; she had been adamant , and she would be coming , as well , if she could postpone some importantmeeting until Tuesday . And Ambrose 's interesting neighbor woman with the silver braids , would she be at the graveside service ? When I did finally get to sleep , I dreamed about her . She was driving us somewhere very fast , along a bumpy road , in a high vehicle , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It felt good being with her ; she was the young mother I 'd never known , yet we were both the same age . She scolded me goodnaturedlyfor letting my license expire . The only thing that impededmy total enjoyment of our trip together was that I had top210keep watching the back seat to make sure something would n't fall on the floor . This something turned out to be Ambrose , dressed in his hound's-tooth jacket and cavalry twills , who lay pale and posed like Wallis 's " Death of Chatterton " on a piece of old fringed brocade . He was reciting something softly under his breath  --  his last words , maybe ? He bounced precariously toward the edge of the seat . " Please , ca n't you slow down a little ? " I begged her . But she laughed and explained we were late already . Despite all this , I woke early and refreshed . As I dressed , I found myself looking forward to the day for the first time in months . Not that I had anything all that pleasant to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place seemed a nice prospect . Of course , I had n't had anything to drink for over thirty hours , that may have had something to do with it . Minerva 's door was still closed . I went quietly through the house and let myself out through the much-locked door . I walked round the old lodge , imagining the neglected flower beds weeded and in bloom , the flagrantly overgrown forsythia trimmed down to reveal the view of the mountains that I now saw went with the site . It was still very early , about six . The grass was wet and the morning light was whitening through the cedars . Behind the lodge , the land sloped steeply down , and there , out of sight from the lodge , was a stream ( the same stream that wound up to Ambrose 's and down the falls to Sam 's ? ) and , beside it , a quaint brown-shingled gazebo with an old pointy roof that looked exactly like a bashedingray straw hat . The picturesque old ruin set against the particularlight of the sky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not have my inks , Bristol board and sponge . I would first go after that light : that would n't wait , gleaming like some very modern , radiant metal not yet discovered . If I could catch that sky , and then dip down quickly and set the shadows in place , then spend the rest of the morning squinting obsessively over every fine line of weathering and neglect . . . I would have capturedthe essence of a certain mood : the mood felt when you find yourself standing directly over the seam of one of time 's juxtapo/sitions . The lower half of the composition would be Time Past , with all its complex and ornate lacings and crosshatchings of things that ca n't be undone , only eroded or romanticized by memory ; in contrast , the whole top area would glow with that blank , almost brutal , silvery-yellow sheen of a young day which has not quite made up its mind whether to be sunny or overcast . " Yoo hoc ) ! There you are ! " It was Minerva , wearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slope . " I thought surely you 'd sleep till eight or nine . Did you get some sleep ? " " Oh , I managed fine . I feel great this morning . The air up here is so clean . I was just looking at your gazebo and wishing I had the whole day free . I 'd love to paint this scene , just as it is now . " " The dear old gazebo . As a child , I spent many happy hours here . I have n't been down here in ages . The poor old roof . I 'll ask Sam if it can be rethatched . As far as your having the whole day to paint . . . well , you may have more time than that , if you meant what you said yesterday about wanting to rent the little cabin . Mr. Chakravorti called last night . He was having second thoughts , he said , about whether the place would be suitable to his needs after all . He and another fellow down at the meditationcenter are thinking of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he realized yesterday that it might be a bit too rustic for him . I said I 'd never pretended it was anything but rustic and gave him Mr. Dean 's number . Did I do right ? " She looked at me shyly , as people do when they 've offered you something you might not want . I did n't want to dampen her gesture with niggling reservations , so I replied , " You sure did , " at once and tried to look pleased . After all , I had told her I was interested . Within a few minutes of our sitting down on the steps of the old gazebo and going over details , I found I was interested , even excited . My polite precipitousness had been just what was needed to push me into a decision . It was what I wanted , was n't it ? A chunk ofp212undivided time  --  at a price I could afford  --  in which to set up my things and see what I could do . Indeed , the longer I thought of it , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could n't affordnot to seize this opportunity . Post-Mortem " You 're actually going to live up there ? " asked Carol . " For a while , anyway . " " But wo n't you get lonely ? " " New York 's lonely . " " Yes , but there 's so much going on . I should think you 'd miss being near the galleries , all the museums .... " " I 've been near them for nine years . Most of the time , I could have been living in Plommet Falls , for all the use I made of them . " Carol sighed . " Well ... " She kicked off her shoes and tucked her dark-stockinged legs up on the roomy back seat of the limousine . " If you 've made up your mind .. . " We were driving  --  being driven , rather  --  back to the city on Monday , after the funeral . I planned to dispose of my apartment , store some things with Milo , and get right back to PlommetFalls before the old fetid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps the most important legacy my uncle had left me . ( Man , that is born of a woman , hath but a short time to live , and is full of misery . He cometh up , and is cut down , like ap213flower ; he fleeth as it were a shadow , and never continueth in one stay . The rector had read well : a genuine Englishman , on summer exchange with the local rector . The funeral had had the simple formal composition of one of those old " Mourning Pictures " that used to be de rigueur in the art classes at female seminaries . Ambrose would have been satisfied , I thought , with the tableau we made , his faithful clique of mourners , including a uniformedchauffeur , gathered in a semicircle around the silver cylinder with an extravagant spray of red carnations I complimentsof Carol alive on its breast like a heart . The round green clumps of summer foliage set on straight dark boles . The purplebluewash of a distant mountain range . And , over it all , the rector'ssolemn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life we are in death . . . . The only missing mourners from our picture had been the very two I was counting on meeting there : the handsome woodswoman with pale braids and her little girl with the wide , curious eyes . ) Carol had n't changed much . She had simply become a hardedgedversion of her old self . Born on Ambrose 's birthday , she was going on fifty , but she had the fashion-adept woman 's knack of knocking off ten years by shrewd grooming . She looked chic , well cared for and in control . Of course , contributing to this effectwas the patina of plain old money , evidenced in the understated , excellently cut clothes , the dark-blue limousine in which we rode , with its soft dove-gray leather upholstery and sliding glass panels between us and Chris , the chauffeur . As formerly in Carol 's presence , I found myself being slightly cowed by her values as she reigned so confidently among them . I could tell that she thought my plan to live in the cabin was more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clays : always able to dream up new flights to postpone getting down to earth . So let 's get off that subject , I thought . I said I thought the funeral had gone well and complimented her on the spray of red carnations . " Yes , he loved red carnations and he was born on Saint Valentine'sday . We both were . My former analyst had an inter/esting theory . He said I was initially attracted to Ambrose because he was my dark twin , the side of me that had learned to waste time and have fun . I 'm not sure I buy that . When I marriedhim , I was convinced he could be an important man . Whereas the analyst I see now thinks I was a sort of super ego for Ambrose . She says he was probably drawn to me because he thought I was capable of locking him in a room until he came out a great writer . " " Hmm . Not very flattering , " I said . " You do n't go to an analyst to be flattered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've never gone . You did n't , when I knew you before , did you ? " " No . All this has been post-Ambrose . It was not an easy time for me , Violet . " There was the slightest reproach in her voice . " It 's taken me the better part of the last eight years to get over the one year and four months I spent with him . Marrying your uncle was the only romantic act I ever committed in my life . Now I 'm content to make what I can of reality . It was strange , seeing him in the casket . He did n't look like his old self . He looked more as I used to imagine he 'd look when he became distinguished . For just a second I had a glimpse of an alternate way things might have turned out . Within nine years , if he 'd been serious , he could have finished that book . It could have made him famous . And then he might have died of something sudden ... like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today , with that beard , and that dignified expression on his face , as if he 'd completed his work . And I was the widow , the widow of a distinguishedman , with whom I 'd been happy for nine busy years So that 's what had gone through her head when , gazing down at Ambrose at O'Halloran 's , before the casket was closed , she had disintegrated suddenly into a few hoarse sobs and then just as suddenly pulled herself together . Yet I liked her better for her " alternate glimpse . " It showed fanciful things were not yet completely denied entrance inside that businesslike head . It made her more like she 'd been when I first knew her , throughp215her brisk but warmly confiding letters and  --  briefly  --  after they 'd come back . It occurred to me that Ambrose had harmed her most not by his failure to produce or by whatever other inconstancieshe 'd been guilty of , but by the mere act of taking himself away from her after having shown her what her full self could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ analyst as well as her current one . I remembered what she 'd told me in her very first letter : how , from ages twenty to forty , she had been so busy living up to her inherited responsibilities that she had neglected to take deep breaths of air and enjoy each momentas it comes . " What a shame it could n't have worked out with you two , " I said . " In a way each of you was the other 's neglected half . I remember what Ambrose said when he wrote he had married you . He said he was at last dealing with a full deck . " " Did he put it like that ? " She laughed . " He had more colorfulfigures of speech than anybody I ever knew . He lies so much you could n't trust him to call his dog , ' he 'd say . Ah , if only he 'd put it all into a book ! " " Carol , do you mind if I ask something ? What did happen to that book ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been through the few things he left , and there 's not a sign of anything . And yet I know he had written some of it . I remember holding a chunk of it in my own hands , once in his apartment on Waverly . He even read me a passage . It was about charm . " " I ca n't tell you where it is now , but in my day , I had the honor of hearing two chapters . The second I hated . The first was a large factor in my marrying him . He read that to me just after we 'd met in Florence and I offered my car when he had to meet that Holiday photographer in Rome . On the way , we decided to stop overnight in Orvieto . It seemed so romantic , a twelfthcenturywalled city , perched up there on its mountain . We arrivedlate and everything was full , except for this rather grand old dilapidated pension . Ambrose was given a sort of passageway with a curtain for his bedroom , because they had one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were n't married ,  |p216we  could n't share it . Officially , that is . " She laughed . " The passageway , however , was right off my room with only the curtain between us , but that did n't seem to count . Oh , the Italians ! Anyway , we were in such good spirits , we decided to play along with the decorum . Ambrose retired modestly and dressed for dinner in his passageway and I in my baronial bedroom that could have accommodated a large family , and then we went out to dinner and afterwards walked around the narrow streets and looked at the cathedral and Ambrose was really inspiring about this book he was trying to finish in his spare time . He had a way of talking that could get anyone excited and I asked him if he would consider reading some of it to me . If you would n't be bored . . . ' he said , and when we got back , he came into my big room and we turned on all the old-fashioned lamps and he went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then he read me a fascinating chapter . It was about a small boy who 's left to himself a lot in a large house  --  all the antiques were described so well , I remember  --  and to amuse himself he imagines he is giving tours of the house . One day he has this customer , an imaginary person , of course , a sinister man who turns things round and takes the boy on a tour  --  " " Oh , yes , and they go upstairs and the boy finds his mother in bed with somebody ? " " That 's right . You 've read it , then ? I thought you said he only read you a passage about charm . " " Er ... that 's true . I must have read this some other time . When I first came to New York , maybe . " Too late , I had rememberedwhy the story had sounded so familiar . I 'd heard it from Sheila . It was the same chapter Ambrose had read to her at Fire Island , years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have talent , " Carol went on , apparently buyingmy extemporaneous cover-up . " I may be in the luggage industry , but I can recognize a good piece of writing . A child would make up something like that , so it would n't be his fault when he found out . . . what he must have known all along . It would be a way to deflect some of the guilt at discovering hisp217mother . No , that chapter was psychologically brilliant . And the suspense ! I remember sitting in that baronial bedroom : it could n't have been better chosen to match the mood of his story  --  all those antimacassars , the heavy furniture , the baroque lamps . I remember thinking : What a shame that this man has to write something this good in his spare time only . He read beautifully , too . " She gazed raptly out the window and , after a moment , shrugged . We had left the mountains behind some time ago . I could just imagine the night in Orvieto : Ambrose , changing into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city eight centuries old ; the soft light from the Baroque lamps ; the lonely , deserving boy peeping now and then from the eyes of the Man of Charm to see how he was doing ; the rich , melodic voice recitingpassages that had had their effect before . . . some of which by this time he may even have known by heart . " I realized after our marriage that , for him , the performance was more gratifying than the act , " she went on . " His enthusiasm for his project stopped exactly short of the drudgery . That famousHoliday article , for example . I could almost have written it myself after listening to him talk about it for six weeks . He talked eloquently , mind you . If only I 'd had a tape recorder at all those candlelit suppers , and at Lake Maggiore when we were driving around with that Fulbright couple , and by the pool , and ... a couple of times in bed I would have had enough to feed into a Dictaphone machine and come out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but many scenes from the great unwrittennovel as well . But I did n't have a tape recorder . More 's the pity , I guess . My fault . I was still under the spell of being a happy , useless bride in the castle . " " Well , it was your honeymoon , after all . " " That it was . As I told my analyst , however disappointingly my marriage turned out , I certainly did have a honeymoon . As long as we stayed in that castle in Siena , the setting was on our side . It made me unlike myself and gave Ambrose the chance to be more nearly his true self than ever before . It was an illu/sion we lived in , but as long as we were in it , we got along excellently . " " But how were you then ? " I awaited her answer with interest . The people I 'd met in the city who went regularly to analystsall had this marvelous facility of packaging their past mistakesinto shapely revisions that shimmered with insights or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she said , " and he lorded . I drifted about wearing long feminine things ; I played the one Polonaise I knew on the antique harpsichord with built-in candleholders ; I wafted down to the kitchen after siesta hour ' and consulted with the cook about dinner . I would see her stealing these sly looks at my body . I knew she was thinking : This one just made it under the wire , but now she 's got herself a hello sposo , and the rest will surely follow . As for Ambrose , he walked about the place as if he owned it , or sat by the pool with a pitcher of ice and a bottle of Punt e Mes , making occasional notes , as the spirit moved him , in a tooled leather notebook with marbled endpapers he 'd bought for himself in Florence . We might still be there now , if old breadwinner Gruber had n't had to go back to work . . . . No ; the truth was , I was aching to get back to work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for both of us . You can just languish for so long . My languishing span is probably shorter than most . " She laughed mirthlessly . " Certainly shorter than Ambrose 's . " " And so you came back , " I said , wanting to hear her side of it now . " And so we came back . And you met us at the airport with your bottle of champagne . And then there was that awful to-do about that Holiday piece . And then he started going down to Waverly Place to work every day , and coming home full of enthusiasmin the evening , and for a while it was okay . Even though the Holiday thing fell through I still believed in his book . And after a while I asked him when I could hear some more of it . He said he was battling his way to the end of a new chapter . I said why not make a ceremony out of it , set a date for the reading and have a champagne dinner afterwards . Ip219thought this would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ender pressure ; I know I do . Well , first the champagne dinner was to be Thanksgiving , then it got delayed till just before Christmas . Then , let 's see , I think it was about then he decided to chuck that chapter  --  it had no place in the book , he said  --  but he was already into another one that he was very excited about . As that deadline approached  --  we were then up to our joint birthday for the champagne celebration  --  he warned me that I might not like some of the material in this chapter , he said he had doubts about reading it to me if I was going to take it literally . I promised I would n't , and at last , on the snowy evening of Saint Valentine 's Day , we opened the first bottle of PiperHeidsieckand my husband read me a very strange chapter entitledFor Pilar  --  with Requited Love . ' " " What was it about ? " " It was about this little girl who had been in love with him for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for years . We ended up having quite a scene over the word protagonist ' that night . " " But how was it strange ? " " Well , it was not at all like the chapter he read in Orvieto ; that was so straightforward , like a real story . In this new thing , it was difficult to tell what time people were in and who was doingthe thinking . But the gist of it was that he the protagonist , I mean  --  had once been a sought-after writer who went to give a lecture at a girls ' boarding school . This beautiful child , a little girl from South America , falls madly in love with him . She writes to him for years after , sends him expensive gifts , dedicatesher schoolgirlish poetry to him . There is one poem with a line that says , Why must our love go unrequited ? ' During all these years , the man  --  the protagonist  --  sinks deeper into a meaningless , dissipated life . But in his letters to the little girl he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man who came to her school . Then  --  now comes the part that was hard to take  --  they meet again . On Madison Avenue of all places . He has becomea copywriter for an ad agency and married a wealthy soci/ety woman ' . . . all the old cliches for selling out , you see . She , the beautiful Pilar , is locked in one of those forever Catholic marriages to a tyrannical young husband , a diplomat at the U.N . who 's a little on the nutty side . He sometimes keeps her in their hotel suite for days , until she agrees to see things his way . " " What things ? " " I do n't know . It was n't made clear in the story . Anyway , I had questions of my own that night . They have a passionate affairat his place in the Village , you see . He called me literalmindedand I ended up crying . " When , I was trying to think , had I last heard from Pequena ? The last letter , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be mother , had come while I was still in college . But Enrique ( what was his last name ? ) had been something in the diplomatic service , I recalled . Was it possible that one day eight years ago , my old roommate had rediscovered the " Primer Caballero " of her childhood on Madison Avenue and become his " meestress " on Waverly Place ? And all this about my grandmother . How literal-mindedwere writers ? That 's what I wanted to know . " And what happened afterwards ? " I asked . " Oh , he smoothed it over in that way he had . We had our feeble champagne supper . " " I mean , what happened in the chapter ? " " Oh , not much . That is , they had the affair . It went on and on during the whole chapter . And then one or the other of them , it was not always clear which , would have a flashback . But things kept coming back to the bed . That was what 's called a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She narrowed her eyes and frowned at the industrial outskirts of New Jersey we were now passing through . If Chris could hear anything on the other side of the glass panel , he gave no sign of it in the erect set of his neatly barbered neck beneath the light-gray cap . " There was one sentence that I still remember , " she said . " She was the only woman in the world who had toes he wanted to kiss . ' " Carol unfolded a stockinged leg from beneath her and wriggled a set of knobbly toes against the plush upholstery . " I hardly think he had these in mind . "  | " Oh , the toes , " I reassured her , " probably came out of his imagination , or , you know , out of that storehouse we all carry around of how we like things to look . The Greek ideal of beauty , certain proportions . . . hands . . . feet ... " I trailed off lamely , as she did n't look in the mood for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said , I am honored to grant you fidelity in real life , but you can hardly chain my imagination to the wedding vows and still expect me to plumb the passions of the human heart . ' I could accept that he made up the girl who had adored him from childhood  --  that was a bit farfetched  --  but . .. there was something that smacked of recent experience , the way he described those toes . " What was the point in bringing up Pequena 's existence now ? We 'd never know whose toes they were in the chapter anyway . " I 'm really sorry , " I said . " I had no idea you two were having trouble till he came by my place one night in September and said he was off to Mexico . " " Oh , we had a few more good times . Things went up and down . Marriages do n't just die from one blow . It 's a cumulative thing , like snow piling up on a branch till the branch breaks . Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had that tubular pregnancy . We did n't tell you , you had your own problems at the time  --  you hated that West Side apartment you 'd moved to and yet I felt it was important for you to make your own way . And you 'd started going to the Art Students League , I remember . You were never free for dinner on the week nights . " " Perhaps everything would have worked out differently if you 'd had a child . " " I honestly doubt it , Violet . Ambrose liked his dreams . The problem with me was I kept waking him up and telling him the day had started . Well , anyway . . . we 're almost to the tunnel . Come home and have dinner with me , wo n't you ? Elena said she 'd leave a lobster salad or something . We 'll open a bottle of nice wine . " " Thank you , I 'd like to . But I do n't think I 'd better . I want to go back to the apartment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call the landlord and see if I can get out ofp222the lease . It should n't be a problem . People are always trying to move into that building . I told Miss Means , the lady you met at the funeral today , I 'd try to be back in Plommet Falls by the end of the week . " " Suit yourself , then . " I could tell she was disappointed . " So you 're really set on banishing yourself to that cabin . What happenswhen the cold weather comes ? " " I 'll turn on the electric heating units . It 's not the kind of log cabin Abe Lincoln lived in or anything . " " And he did pretty well without electric heat . But he had so much ... " She checked herself . " Drive ? " " A sense of purpose , yes . " " So do I. Now . I feel if I do n't start painting all day every day within the week , I 'll be doomed . " " But why not stay in your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Because that place is the scene of so much failure . It would be like trying to start a smooth new painting on a scumbly old canvas . Also I have to get out of there soon , anyway . The rent 's too much for just one person . I took it with someone else and now we 've split . And also , " I hurried on , afraid she might think I was angling for a loan , " and this is really the most important reason of all , I need the gesture that moving up to Plommet Falls implies . " " You Southerners and your gestures . But did n't Ambrose go up there for the same reason , to make the same sort of gesture ' after wasting all those years in Mexico ? I 've always liked you , Violet ; better than you 've liked me , I think . I mean it when I say this : I 'd sincerely hate to see you throw away your talent like he did . Are you very sure that this move to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carol , when I first came to New York , Ambrose took me to the Top of the Sixes and bought me my first Manhattan and showed me his eagle's-eye view , ' as he called it , of the city . He was in top form that night and so was I. I thought it was all going to be so easy . When that English priest threw the handful of sodp223on the casket today , I buried my last hope for any easy victory . Also Ambrose said something else to me that night . We were talking about how the channel that lets ships into New York was called Ambrose Channel and he laughed and said , You got to go through me , kid . ' I remembered him saying that , today at the cemetery . And I thought to myself , how nice if I could live in his place and make good a few Clay promises , after all . I feel almost religious about going back up there and seeing what I can make of it . " " Ah , in that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be it from me to tamper with any more creative spirits , much less a religious impulse . No , Violet , I 'm not making fun of you . I really hope you make it . For several years after Ambrose left , and you and I had that polite luncheon at Schrafft 's , I would check the gallery ads every Sunday in the Times . Every week I 'd steel myself for the sight of your name in one of those little squares . I had mixed feelings . I wanted you to make it , but I was bitter because I would no longer have a share in your happiness . I had hoped the three of us would be a sort of family . Well , let me tell you something . If and when the day comes that I do see your name , my feelings wo n't be mixed anymore . Both of us buried somethingup there today . I buried my resentment . There was a lot of it , but " she put her hand on mine  --  " I really think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her , touched by her candor . I was half tempted to say I had changed my mind about the lobster salad and wine . But just then we entered the Lincoln Tunnel and as the tiled walls , yellowish in the underground light , sped monotonously past , I felt the old inertia lurking even now in the edges of my resolve . I did n't trust myself in Carol 's territory with a full stomachunquickening my blood and a good wine displacing gravity with effervescence in my head . I would sit there in her well-appointedspace , the relics of her family 's solidity and what her own industry had added grouped round us like testimonials , and I might begin to doubt the solidity of that little cabin , shimmering , as I had first seen it , in its equal mixture of sun and shadow . It represented my vision of what might still be done . But it wasp224a frail and fledgling vision balanced precariously between the practical and the ideal . The least tipping of my attitude toward skepticism or sloth could render it into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her Gucci bag . " Here 's my card , so you wo n't have the excuse of not knowing where to reach me . I 'd like it so much if you 'd just call every now and then .... " " I 'll write . I wo n't have a phone up there . " " You really are going , are n't you . Well , I wish you luck . Will you keep in touch ? I have a genuine curiosity about what will happen to you . " " I 'll write , then . " " Promise ? " " I promise . " She leaned over and laid her cool cheek against mine . She still wore such nice perfume . " Oh ! And do n't forget your Times . " Arriving in Plommet Falls this morning , she had presentedit to me folded open to Ambrose 's obituary as modestly as if it had been her own gift . " It 's placed well , people can see it , " she said now , studying it possessively . " Of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day . Even when compressed into two paragraphs , he manages to come out looking glamorous , does n't he ? " Between FriendsIt was late Friday afternoon , exactly one week since Ambrose 's suicide had put the finishing touch on my Day of Lost Options , as I 'd come to think of it . I was sitting in Milo 's garden , sketch/ing his brilliant array of late-summer flowers with my new set of Marvy Markers , their forty-eight colors listed on the inside of the box in four languages . I had gone a bit wild at the art supplyshop the day before , following my success at having sublet my apartment to three members of a mime troupe . ( " I do n't much like the idea of three , " grumbled the landlord . " Oh , but they 'll be as quiet as one , " I 'd assured him . " That 's their profession . " ) Three young hopefuls , full of enthusiasm for everything to do with New York , they had padded on tensed dancers ' legs from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A girl with thick flowing hair to her waist , and two boys : a couple and their friend . The couple bought the double bed Jake and I had occupied ; I hoped our old animosities would not haunt them . The boy would make his bedroom in my old studio . To him I sold a table , a chair and the studio couch from the living room . They bought the dishes and rugs as well . They wrote me out checks still drawn on a bank in Urbana , Illinois . " We 'll take any work we can get , till we get established , " they explained . The girl was excited because she was pretty sure she had got a job doing a shampoo commercial . I had mailed myselfthree boxes of art supplies care of Minerva Means , and managed to compress nine years ' worth of accumulations into two portable bulks . My stereo and record collection , as well as a dozen or so paintings not bad enough to throw away but not good enough to live in a one-room cabin with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with me on the morning bus to PlommetFalls . Milo was watering his flowers . His form hovered so gracefullyover a cluster of brilliant dahlias that I had half a mind to include him in the composition . In the late-afternoon light he looked like some serene gold-dappled ascetic in a Pisanello . But if I remained true to the hard , hot-hued flowers , I would render him pale and insubstantial ; on the other hand , if I set my mind to capturing his ethereal grace , the flowers would appear gaudy in contrast . No , Milo was more of a watercolor than a Marvy Marker composition , and having decided , I put a rich splotchp226of magenta right where the loose-flowing line of his creamyshirtedrib cage would otherwise have gone . " Ha , " I said , consulting the multilingual color chart . " You 'll never guess what the German is for magenta . Rotviolett . I hope that 's not symbolic or anything . " " No , your color is New Violet now . " " Hmm . It does n't seem to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Violet would be . " " Let 's see , " he said , turning to consider me . " I see it as a color with lots of light in it . . . an airy , spacy color . . . but also with muscle to it . " " Oh , really ? But what makes you say that ? " I sensed a complimentglimmering behind his description and , frankly , wanted to include it in the crucial baggage I would take with me to the Adirondacks . " It 's already begun to show in your work . Of course , I do n't mean color ' in the sense of the spectrum . I mean it as a recognizablequality in your painting . It 's the way you leave light in and around things so they have room to breathe . Perhaps even to change , or move . " " But what about the muscle ? " I coaxed shamelessly . " That comes across in the way you do your lines . They have firmness , yet there 's the suggestion of stretch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see this in my less good things , like the ones I brought over today for you to store ? " I pursued it hungrily to the dregs . " Well , perhaps not as much . " He scrupulously drew the line between constructive praise and detrimental flattery . " But what 's important , Violet , is what you will do now . It 's exciting , both of us embarking on new projects , do n't you find it so ? " " I was awfully glad to hear you 'd started something again . I was a little worried about you last week , to tell the truth . " " I was beginning to get worried myself , if you want to know . " He eased onto the redwood chaise longue next to mine , crossed his long legs at the ankles , and pressed his fingers to/gether above his chest , cathedral style . " Seven months , in all , of lying fallow . First the fruitless trip to Greece . Then coming back and making at least a dozen false starts . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know how many times I went through it , trying to pull that infant out of the sea , while his frightful mother did her best to do me in . Actually , it 's you I have to thank for rescuing me . " " Me ? " " You remember you told me how you confronted your math teacher in your dream , and she agreed to let you make up the exam ? You told me to ask my woman what she wanted , why she was trying to kill us . " " And it worked ? " " Not quite in the way you advised . I could n't manage to carry my question all the way into the dream . What I did do , one night , was sit down and write her a letter on my typewriter . I invited her to respond and offered my services at the keyboard . " A weird little smile , half embarrassed , half astute , flickeredover his cool profile . " And did she ? " I loved it when Milo entered this dimension @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was difficult to shut her up . I ended up promising to give her a full hearing in my new book . . . if she 'd let me write a new book . " " If she 'd let you ? Was it she who was stopping you ? " " I think so , yes . " " But ... who was she ? Who is she ? " " She 's lonely and neglected . And the loneliness and the neglecthas made her angry . And when she gets angry , she is powerful . She is capable in her way of creating quite a havoc . " I squirmed in a sort of mental frisson and recapped the magentamarker . " And what did she say in her reply to you ? Was her style different from yours ? " " At the beginning it was an outburst of all kinds of things  --  grievances , lamentations , potluck philosophies , ominous warningswhich tended to be couched in Old Testament rhetoric . You ask was the style different from mine . I certainly hope so.  |p228Hers  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ semisuperstitiousmanner , he looked up over his shoulder , toward his workroomwindow upstairs . " I feel a bit nervous even now , criticizing her . But the essence of her message was : I was n't always an object to be feared and shunned . I had my dreams , just like you . Any you 'd better make it your business to find out what they were . " " And so you 've already started . It 's going to be her story , then , your new book ? You 've abandoned the idea of the male Jane Eyre , the thing you were talking about last week ? " " No . She 's made him all the clearer . I 've already felt the terrorshe 's going to feel in relation to her . What she 's done , Violet  --  she has a name now , by the way  --  is provide the psychic force which has brought it all together for me and may make it possible for me to aim for a new level of writing . She first came into my life through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floor in Greece . I tried to suppress her then ; I found the whole thing oppressive as well as unappetizing . I wrote off my trip to Greece as a waste and determined not to set my next book there . But she followed me home and settled her ominous bulk right into the middle of my nightmare . I dreamed about her for four months , Violet . When you dream the same dream over and over for four straight months . . . well , it 's a step towards the edge . I might have gone over if it had n't been for a favorable combination of things . Your wonderful suggestion about getting into conversation with the figures inside one 's unconsciouswas the catalyst . You put me in touch with Kaatjethat'sto be her name . Now I 've got her , she 's mine , and she 's going to work for me . " " Oh , Milo , this is fascinating . I envy you . I wonder whether I have any figures like that who 'd be willing to work for me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It 's Dutch . No , it may be fascinating , but it could have been the other way round . She could have got me , and I might not have fared too well in her employment . Take my advice and do n't go raising sleeping demons . If and when they stir , you 'll know it . Quite honestly , I would n't wish them on you . "  | " Well , then , you must compensate me by sharing yours . Why is she Dutch ? I want to hear all the details . " I made a choice between Bottle Green and Oriental Blue for a patch of shadow behind the dahlias . " It all started when I returned from Greece . At first I did n't suspect I was in for any trouble . I went to my workroom my first morning back , as I go to my workroom most mornings of my life , and I sat down to begin Arabella 's next novel . I had opted , after all , for an English setting . I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with my talents than an island of unrelenting blue sky and cooks having babies in the kitchen . The first morning I could n't write a line . I could n't imagine anything  --  nota glimpse of a landscape , not one overheard phrase of thought or conversation , nor a single expression on a face . In the past , I could take off from any of these and go on from there . But that morning there was . . . just nothing . " He hugged his arms to his chest as though he were suddenly chilled . " I concludedI was suffering from jet lag and went to bed and slept all that day and through the night and into the next afternoon . I woke feeling a bit fuzzy , but I went to my workroom . Nothing again . Every time I 'd range round in my mind looking for an impetus , all I saw was that woman writhing on the floor , blood and water pouring out . It was then I decided to force something . If I could n't see any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the typewriter and begin to write as if I were transcribing them . I 'd imitate my old methods . I selected one of Arabella 's early works from the shelf , opened to the first page and simply made a variation on the first sentence . It went something like : When Louisa opened the solicitor 's letter and learned that her great-uncle Marcus had bequeathed her his cottage in Lyme Regis , her first reaction was one of mild inconvenience . ' " Milo laughed dryly . " I struggled through sixty-odd pages with the inconveniencedLouisa , who at last gave me to understand that she did n't want to be in my story any more than she wished to be forced to poke around her great-uncle 's moldy old cottage . After Louisa came Margaret , also a recalcitrant heiress , and after her came Clare , who started out as a promising restorer of oldp230paintings . . . . I remember I almost phoned you at the time to ask you some technical questions . By the time Clare got trapped under a top-heavy load of research @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the workroom had become a penance I imposed on myself merely for the sake of honoring my old friends discipline and habit . After a dozen or so more false starts , I began to resign myself to the idea that Arabella Stone had writtenher last and Milo Hamilton would have to find other work for himself . But I continued to go every morning to my workroom . To be honest , I found I could n't not go . It was ingrained into my life . But now I ceased altogether attempting fresh starts and just sat at the desk , looking out at cloud formations or letting my mind drift where it would . Suddenly one day I had a perfectly clear vision of a house . " " A house you made up or one you know ? " " It was a ruin of an old stone house on the Hudson River . I saw it just once when I was small . Then I forgot it and the circumstancescompletely . Which is odd , because that day was the last happy memory I have of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mad for the final time and never came out of it again . But this day we saw the house was a beautiful midsummer 's day . We 'd been on vacation and were driving slowly home to Rochester , taking the scenic route along the Hudson . When all at once this ruin of a house swam up in front of us like a hallucination . It was four stories high , with a steep single-pitched roof and nothing to soften its harsh lines . It looked as if it had been empty for years . At the very top were two small oblong windows that seemed to squint at us like closeseteyes . My father laughed and said , Whoever could have wanted to build such a rawboned , unlovable house ? ' And my mother said , Whoever built it probably thought it was very beautiful and loved it very much . ' And my father answered , ' Ellen , you 'd have something good to say about Hell itself . ' Then he pulled her over to the driver 's side and kissed her and when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He narrowed his eyes dreamily at his flowers and was silent.  | " And the house , is it going to be in the book , too ? " " Yes . The house that Kaatje built . When she came into her patrimony and determined to make up to herself all she 'd missed . Only it 's late , you see . She 's almost forty . She 's never known any company except her father 's and he was . . . well , he was mad . Now she 's deaf in one ear from a bout of her late father 's violence , and whatever attractiveness she possessed is pretty well obscured by fat . But she 's determined to have the good things of life , as far as she 's been able to learn what they are in that isolated region of New York in the early eighteenth century . " " Oh , it 's historical , then . " I would n't have let him know for the world , but my heart sank at the mention of the date @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . promising . Something that I could use myself : a story about a woman who got started late and still managed to recoup her losses . " Only that it starts then . I plan to carry it into the present . Though Kaatje 's spirit will dominate the entire thing , it will be about her descendants , as well . " " Ah , so she finds a husband and has children . " " Not a husband , " said Milo . " And only one infant . And after his birth she never looks on him again . But I 'll spoil the suspensefor you . I 'd rather you read it . It 's to be a working out of a curse , you see , Kaatje 's curse , over two hundred years . But I had started by telling you how Kaatje 's letter to me consolidatedall this . Because the house was n't the breakthrough , not by any means . I filed it away as an image whose time had not come , whose time might never come . Just as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a voice , the voice of a young man , say , I 'm afraid to go in there ! ' Just that , as clearly as though he 'd been in the same room . Nothing more . When I was weeding the garden that evening , I thought : Why not a gothic novel in which the man is the figure who is acted upon , for a change ? And I heard myself telling the idea to you , as I used to use you as a sounding board in those days when we saw more of each other . Well , she 'll call again one of these days , when shep232wants to see me again , I thought , and then , for the first time in weeks , I felt hungry , I felt like cooking something . And I made a salmon mousse and went out and bought black bread and cheese and some wine , and as I was walking home I had a vision of a young man , rather like a younger version of myself , walking up to that forbidding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then . . . just standing very still , listening . And then that very same night you called . And the nature of the evening being what it was , we spoke of things that people do n't often speak about . And then you dropped your good hint about conversing with the people in your dreams . And . . . well , after a few more bad days and nights , I wrote my letter . And my fat woman let it be known that it was her house . After I had that much to go on , the rest followed with an uncanny ease . I went to the library and looked at books about old Dutch houses in the Hudson Valley . In one book I found a photograph of a house very similar to the one I 'd seen with my parents that long ago summer day . And in the same book I found the seed of my story . Just the barest hint of a story , but I could tell it was right . It was as if my woman , my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I could fit very well there ' " " An actual story about something that happened ? " " Yes . In the seventeenth century in a place called Coeymans , New York , there was a Dutch immigrant who 'd made his fortune in the New World . Little is known about him , except that he left a large estate to his daughter , a spinster in middle life . As soon as she inherited she began to build an enormous house , incorporating all her ideas of elegance ; she also had a lifesizeportrait painted of herself , though she had no claim to beauty , ' as the book puts it . The only other thing we know about her  --  the real woman 's name was Ariaatje  --  was that she took seven years to build this formidable house and then , at fifty-one , she married a man of twenty-eight and the marriage was unhappy . But I 've altered a good bit of the facts for my purposes . Kaatje does n't marry . Except for . . . well , except for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do her , she livesp233quite alone . And I 'm not telling you one sentence more . It 's bad luck . Perhaps I 'll send you some later , for bedtime reading in your cabin . " " But now you 've got me fascinated . It sounds ultra-gothic already . There 's something about a person alone in a certain kind of house . I told you about poor Minerva Means . Only she 's just preserved like some butterfly in all her family history . No , on second thought , there 's nothing very gothic about Minerva . " " On the contrary , Violet , I think the very essence of what we have come to call gothic , ' all those winding passageways and trap doors and dark stairways , may have a great deal to do with the family . With things we have n't been able to deal with . So we put them underground or in the attic , whichever you choose . We forget they 're there except when they manifest themselves in some form of brooding terror , or a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " What ? The parents , or the things we have n't dealt with ? " " I 'm . .. not sure it makes a great deal of difference . I 've thought a lot about this . It 's been on my mind , you see . Whether or not Demuth knew he was painting his mother when he painted James 's governess . Whether that armored hand on Horace Walpole 's banister in Otranto was n't his heavy-handed father 's hand . I read everything I could find on the subject when I was unable to write . I know a lot more than I did about it . And a good deal more about myself . " He flushed slightly . " And do you know now why the young man says , I 'm afraid to go in there ' ? " It had just occurred to me that I had been privy to the rarest of treats : a guided tour through the creative channelsof another person 's psyche . In some ways to offer such a tour to another was more intimate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I know that , too . I 've been there myself . Now no more , Violet . If you like , I 'll sent you some of it when it 's done . Which may not be awfully long . I 've been going like the wind since the evil spell broke . And you 've been the midwife . You 'll understand I do n't use the word haphazardly when you read the first part of Kaatje 's Curse . "
