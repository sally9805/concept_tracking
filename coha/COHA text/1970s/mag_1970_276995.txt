THE dynamism , the energy of the Japanese " was a recurring theme of Tokyo Bureau Chief Edwin Reingold 's many dispatches for this week 's cover story on Japan , its people , and its place in the world and history . The Japanese could easily return the compliment . Reingold and his colleagues , Frank Iwama and S. Chang , covered the country from Hokkaido to Kyushu and Okinawa . They attended cheerful festivals as well as grim student riots ; they interviewed philosophers , business magnates , artists , shopkeepers , critics and politicians ( including Premier Sato ) . " In a way , I have been working on this cover ever since I arrived here just one year ago , collecting interviews , impressions and material , " says Reingold . If that is true of Reingold , it certainly is doubly so of Iwama , who has been a member of the Tokyo bureau for 20 years , and of Chang , a mere neophyte of nine years with TIME . Iwama specialized in Japan 's industrial and business growth while Chang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Correspondent Louis Kraar provided an overview of the Japanese abroad . Says Reingold : " We got excellent cooperation from almost everyone involved . Their punctuality was incredible , at least to me , after having worked in Africa and Latin America . One difficulty is that many Japanese can be too convincingly self-deprecating . They are just too good at telling you how inadequate they find themselves , while you can see all around you the abundant evidence of their adequacy . " <P> And so , we believe , will TIME 'S readers see that evidence in the cover story written by Timothy James and researched by Marion Knox . Tim and Marion have yet to make their first visit to Japan , but Senior Editor Ronald Kriss qualifies as an old hand in the Orient after military service in the 1950s plus a Pulitzer traveling scholarship ; in fact , his first child was born in Tokyo . <P> The Cover : Design and photography by Robert S. Crandall . <P> <P> In the Feb. 9 issue , TIME announced a new pamphlet prepared by our Education Department @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help adults understand the youngsters ' problems , and to encourage the kids themselves to find less risky ways of turning on . Distributed tree to teachers enrolled in TIME 'S subscription program , the pamphlet was also offered to the general public at $1.50 per copy .
