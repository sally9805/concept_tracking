It was over in a matter of minutes . The police van braked to a stop , 40 civil guards in tan shirts and steel helmets jumped out and , while most of Lima slept through a foggy March dawn , Peru 's leftist military junta took over two opposition newspapers , the morning Expreso and evening Extra . The remaining opposition Lima daily-La Tribuna-was then reduced to a mimeograph edition when the regime embargoed its presses . <P> Military repression is no novelty in South America . But in Peru , where press freedoms have gone relatively unchallenged for nearly 50 years , the latest muzzling came as a surprise . Following the same course that Dictator Juan Pern took in seizing Argentina 's La Prensa in 1951 , the junta declared that the two expropriated newspapers would be turned over to a staffers ' union and cooperative . As La Prensa learned nearly two decades earlier , the move was not so liberal as it might have seemed . Not only must the union rely on junta funding , but the reporters and editors also face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Last week a La Tribuna editor and an editor of Norte were sentenced to six months in prison for violating Peru 's euphemistically named " Press Freedom Law . " <P> Shock Waves . Censorship in all its forms is spreading in South America . In Bolivia last month , the leftist military regime decreed that " press workers ' ' would henceforth " enjoy the Sunday rest . " In fact , the Sunday work suspension snuffed out the Monday morning editions of all four major papers that are hostile to the government . In addition , the government 's insistence that newspapers provide space on the editorial page for reporters to " freely express their ideas under their signatures " was actually an attempt to curb antigovernment editorials . <P> Bolivian journalists have more to fear than tricky decrees . Alfredo Alexander , publisher of La Paz 's morning Hoy and evening Ultima Hora , was with his wife at his elegant estate when a man with a visor cap and large dark glasses delivered a shoe-box-size package . It contained a bomb , and minutes later the explosion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across the continent . <P> Simpler Still . New York Governor Rockefeller 's visit to South America last June-and the disorders that accompanied it-gave some governments the excuse they were looking for to crack down on the press . Shortly before the Governor 's arrival , Brazil issued " recommendations " to the press that banned all stories on any visit-connected disorders in any Latin American country . <P> In January , Brazilian right-wing leaders decreed a new censorship law aimed mainly at pornography and obscenity , under which 5,000 copies of the February Playboy were impounded for three weeks before being released for sale in opaque plastic wrappers . Political censorship is somewhat more subtle . By telephone or personal visits , Brazilian army officers tell publishers and broadcast executives which subjects are taboo . The latest taboo is any mention of the torture methods that are blatantly used by police and military against political prisoners . In Paraguay , Panama , Haiti and Cuba , the rules are simpler still . No opposition newspaper is allowed , and all papers are subject to seizure .     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
