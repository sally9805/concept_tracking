 | The prostitute puts her lighted cigarette on an ashtray and begins to undress . The man , carefully keeping his eyes on her eyes , asks , " Are you really twelve and a half ? " The girl ignores the question . " Listen , mister , " she says . " It 's your time . Fifteen minutes ai n't so long . When that cigarette burns out , your time is up .... So how do you want to make it ? " Pornography , right ? Wrong . The scene is from Taxi Driver , one of last year 's most acclaimed Hollywood productions ? a movie which was nominated for four Academy Awards , including Best Supporting Actress for Jodie Foster in the part of the child streetwalker . Jodie was 12 at the time the film was made by Columbia Pictures . She is now not yet 15 . Along with Linda Blair and Tatum O'Neal , she has become one of Hollywood 's three reigning teenage stars . At a time when important roles for women are very hard to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they know what to do with . How come ? What put them where they are today ? First , of course , it was their talent . All three are shot through with ability .  | Second , it was their willingness ? with the apparent backing of their parents ? to accept a part that , no matter how rough , promised to advance their careers . Third , and most important , was Hollywood 's discovery that when it uses children as sex objects , the skies do n't fall . On the contrary , profits go through the roof . It was Warner Brothers ' The Exorcist that broke the ice . In it , Linda Blair , then 14 , played the part of a 12-year-old who , when possessed by the devil , turned into a foulmouthed. screeching banshee , making lewd overtures to adults ( including her mother ) , and shrieking the most obscene language ever heard on the screen . Although some moviegoers ( myself among them ) found it too distasteful to sit through , many , many more were willing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be shocked out of their skins . When the final count was in , The Exorcist had sold enough tickets to make it the third most popular film in Hollywood history . Linda Blair was nominated for an Academy Award . Since then there has been no stopping the trend , either in movies made for movie houses or for TV . Perhaps that 's because there has been little protest from the general public . And perhaps that 's because so many people do n't go to the movies these days . As for TV , the networks have sidestepped trouble by scheduling questionable material at times when children are presumably asleep and by conscientiously flashing " viewer discretion " warnings . But there have been complaints from one unlikely source : the pornographers . To a man , they are dead set against child exploitation because they claim it 's hurting their business . In 1974 , a bad year for porn in which profits went down two-thirds from ' 73 , the manager of an " adult " bookstore fired a public blast at the legitimate film industry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " They 're now showing films to children we used to get arrested for . " Obviously , he was exaggerating . The Exorcist carried an R rating and if children saw it ? as many did ? it was because their parents took them . And anyway , as the saying goes , people in glass houses should n't throw stones . As for the pornographers themselves , who use young children and adolescents in explicit-sex films and in nasty magazines , virtually everyone deplores their activities . But somehow they keep slipping through the loopholes of the law . In the March 1977 Good Housekeeping , a fighting , young prosecutor in Memphis , Tenn. , unfolded his plan for eradicating flagrant pornography in just two years , and has already succeeded in getting some convictions .  | Meantime , many parent groups are waging their own counterattacks . The PTA Board of the C.J. Going School in Birmingham , Ala. , for example , has sent a sharply worded protest to state officials demanding , " a stronger , enforceable law preventing criminal exploitation of children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a knotty problem in law enforcement . But what about the mass-circulation films made by major studios and seen by millions of viewers at home and in movie houses ? Should n't you , 1 , our friends and neighbors make it our business to see that children are protected from sex abuse in these films ? all children on both sides of the camera ? Consider , for example , how youngsters were used in these recent pictures : Born Innocent , a made-for-TV film aired by NBC in 1974 , starred Linda Blair as a teenage runaway who is shunted off to a juvenile detention home and there raped with a broom handle by a gang of lesbian inmates . The film spared us none of the horrors of its heroine 's life , including an alcoholic mother and a deeply neurotic father . It proved to be the season 's second biggest hit among made-for-TV dramas . Sarah T : Portrait of a Teenage Alcoholic on , NBC , also starred Linda Blair and also omitted no horrors . It ranked high in the TV ratings . Sweet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time it aired last fall on ABC-TV , however , she was 17 and therefore an adult in the eyes of the film industry . ABC promoted it as " a bizarre drama about a young woman , kidnapped by an escaped mental patient , who is led into a strange world where her abductor becomes her teacher , friend and lover . " It turned out to be only a moderate hit . Could it be that people are getting sick of the seamy side of life ? Or could it be that Linda is now too old to be titillating as a sex object ? It should be said that TV 's rationale for Born Innocent and the rest is that they make the public aware of serious social problems . No such case can be made for the moviehouse counterparts of the TV films . To wit : Bugsy Malone , in which Jodie Foster appears as a speakeasy queen , is a song-and-dance picture from Paramount that 's supposed to be a lighthearted spoof of gangster movies . The cast is made up exclusively of children . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be convincing in their own right , I found Bugsy less offensive than many pictures . Still , it bothered me . Is n't there something sick ( or at least dubious ) about trying to make a joke out of gangland warfare ? And when children are asked to play " let 's pretend , " are n't there better models than mobsters and their molls ? The Little Girl Who Lives Down the Lane is Jodie Foster 's most recent release . Produced by Zebra Braun , it 's another " bizarre " tale in which Jodie plays the part of a well-scrubbed 13-year-old who is forced by circumstances to dispose of her vicious , thieving , drunken mother . The deed is done by means of poison and is handled delicately in the film . But nonetheless ... . We have yet to see little Tatum O'Neal as either a prostitute or a murderer . But in Paramount 's Paper Moon we saw her as a street-smart , cigarette-smoking nineyear-old , a master at con games and small-time heists . That was her first picture and a smash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only adults are considered . But surely it ca n't be good for children ? either in the audience or in the cast ? to see juvenile delinquency pay off so handsomely and for such an irresistible delinquent . Tatum 's second movie , The Bad News Bears , was a very funny picture , thanks largely to the unprintable language of its 12-year-old star and her even younger Little League teammates . Although Paramount Pictures had worried about how it would be received by parents ( a line like " Blow it outa your bung hole " is relatively mild ) it turned out to be a huge box-office success . It not only made Ryan O'Neal 's 12-year-old daughter a full-fledged movie star , but won her the distinction of being the only female . on Variety 's list of the 10 top box-office attractions . Nor is the end in sight . Paramount Pictures recently began work on a movie called Pretty Baby which centers in the New Orleans red-light district and features a child , born and brought up in a brothel , who steps into her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the picture will be produced and directed by the great French director , Louis Malle , it is sure to be artfully handled . But artful or not , Malle appears to be fascinated by sick sex . His Murmurs of the Heart , about a 10-year-old boy 's incestuous relationship with his mother , was a shattering experience for the viewer . This time he 's cast a child who is not yet 12 in the role of the child prostitute . Her name is Brooke Shields and she is an exquisite little girl who is already being billed as competition for Jodie Foster and Tatum O'Neal . At 11 months old , when she was discovered by photographer Francesco Scavullo , she was used in a soap ad . More recently she has posed in a shampoo advertisement and was murdered on screen in a horror movie , Communion . Possibly you remember way back when the movie industry went to almost ludicrous lengths to protect the sensibilities of its audience ? and its own reputation . Under its former Production Code , administered first by Will Hays and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a kiss ; men and women ? no matter how long married ? were never shown in bed ( even for the purpose of sleep ) ; nudity was so fiercely proscribed that a girl in a bathing suit could n't cross her legs for fear of revealing a glimpse of inner thigh . During the ' 50s and the ' 60s it became increasingly obvious that that kind of self-imposed prudery had fallen out of step with the times . And therefore there were few mourners when the Production Code was finally scrapped in the late ' 60s . Since then Hollywood has made no attempt to be a moral policeman , but restricted itself to alerting moviegoers as to what kind of picture they 're about to see . That 's the function of the Motion Picture Association 's four-part rating system , ranging from X ( no one under 17 admitted ) , through R ( children must be accompanied by parents ) , to PG ( parental guidance called for ) , to G ( for general audiences ) . On the whole I think the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adults have the chance to see even the ugliest movies , provided they 've been alerted as to what they 're in for ? ) But the system breaks down when it comes to the protection of children ? both children who go to the movies and children who act in them . One of the ironies of the present situation is that all the pictures we 've been talking about have had either an R or a PG rating . That means that they ca n't be seen by their young stars ? or their friends ? without a parental okay .  | In the days when they made movies like National Velvet and The Wizard of Oz , an ironclad , industry-wide taboo stood guard over the innocence of childhood ; today there is no one to say how a child may or may not be used ? except the child 's parents . When reporters questioned Linda Blair 's parents - about their decision to let her take on The Exorcist role , her mother said , " I knew Linda and I knew it could n't bother her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . There have n't been any problems . " Linda herself seems to be justification for her mother 's confidence . When a script has called for obscenities , she has recited them ? and very effectively ? but the language has never seemed to get to her . Nor the gestures she 's had to make . Nor the fact that she 's been so often raped and abandoned and otherwise abused in the course of her working days . For her it 's all been simply a job to be done . She 's a very cool young lady . So is Jodie Foster , according to her mother , Brandy . ( Jodie 's parents are divorced and her father has played little part in her career . Her mother is her manager and both she and Jodie say yea or nay to the roles being offered . ) When the streetwalker part in Taxi Driver came along , Brandy Foster turned it down . But later she reconsidered . " I know Jodie well , " she explained on a CBS interview . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that we had n't discussed .... I do n't think you put ideas into a **25;70;TOOLONG . " Mrs. Foster has reported elsewhere that her judgment was later corroborated by a UCLA psychiatrist with whom Jodie spent four hours before she was finally allowed to sign for the part . The doctor found Jodie equal to anything . And so has almost everyone who 's ever worked with her . There seems no doubt that Jodie is truly a remarkable child . Listening to Brooke Shields ' mother you almost think you 're hearing Jodie Foster 's . " Brooke has such a level head , " Terry Shields told me . " I know her so well , and I always know what she 's thinking . " Terry Shields , like Brandy Foster , is divorced and serves as her daughter 's manager . She says she 's a tough disciplinarian , but also that she 'd never pressure Brooke to take on a part she did n't want to do . Brooke was offered a role as a teenage swimmer in Jaws ii , but Terry turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brooke said she did n't want to be eaten by a shark . " A childish reason , is n't it , since obviously the shark would be made of plastic ? But that 's what I found most appealing about Brooke Shields . Her reactions are still those of a child and not a movie star . She 'd far rather talk about horses than the celebrities she 's worked with . For all the murder and mayhem she 's been exposed to , her eyes still brim with tears at the thought of the dog she lost last Christmas . But I wonder . Can her childishness survive the job she 'll be doing for Louis Malle as a prostitute ? Can childhood , no matter how stable the child , survive such experiences ? And it 's not only the current crop of child stars I worry about . Granted they all are ? as their mothers so confidently claim ? remarkably steady , easy , " normal " children . What about the youngsters who 'll be knocking at Hollywood 's door tomorrow and the day after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be so foolproof that no amount of sex exploitation can throw them off track ? That hardly seems likely . And just as the content of films today is far rougher and bawdier than it was five or ten years ago , what about the films of the future ? Is n't there every likelihood that sex exploitation of children on the screen will escalate alarm-ingly ? And let 's also think about the children out front in the audience , for we all know that many youngsters watch TV without parental supervision , and many parents are indifferent to the rating guidelines for movies . Can we be sure that all juvenile viewers are sufficiently stable and " together " to remain untouched by subteens spouting vile language , little girl streetwalkers and offbeat sex practiced on or by youngsters their own age ? That , too , hardly seems likely . Is n't it about time , then , that mothers make their voices heard .
