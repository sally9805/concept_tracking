THE TALK OF THE TOWN Notes and Comment WITH the departure of the Shah of Iran from his country on what promises to be a long , long " vacation , " one of the strangest political confrontations of recent times approaches its close . On one side was a head of state who possessed all the formidable means of control with which our brutal century has supplied unscrupulous rulers . He commanded one of the most lavishly equipped  --  or , to use the modish term , " sophisticated " ? armies in the world . He had at his disposal a secret-police force that was known internationally for its cruelty and efficiency . He controlled the channels of mass communication . He had banned the political opposition and jailed much of its leadership . His family 's fortune , amassed in what may be the largest single case of financial corruption in history , amounted to an estimated twenty billion dollars . ( India 's latest annual budget was eighteen billion dollars . ) In addition to all this , he enjoyed the unreserved support of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States . Iran was seen by most of the world not only as an " island of stability " ( to use President Carter 's infelicitous phrase of last year ) but also as a " regional superpower . " On the other side was an amorphous , unorganized ( at first ) , and unarmed opposition movement that appeared to be led by an Islamic clergyman who was living in France . According to most methods of reckoning political power , the Shah should have been nearly invincible ; yet after only a few months of political struggle he was defeated , and his opposition , which now seemed to consist of almost the entire nation , was dancing in the streets . The opposition did not espouse a philosophy of nonviolence ( its slogan , " Death to the Shah , " was hardly pacific ) ; yet the fact is that it carried out one of the very few nonviolent revolutions in his tory . Its first move was to launch enormous public demonstrations ; its second move was to go on strike , most notably in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grke was to physically embrace the soldiers in the streets and put carnations in their gun barrels . Among the most remarkable features of the Iranian revolution was the uselessness to the Shah of his control over the apparatus of force . Surface-to-air missiles and squadrons of advanced jet planes were of no help in dealing with workers on strike and with demonstrating citizens . And one diplomatic observer on the scene said of the Shah 's troops , " They can shoot people , but they can not make them work ; even the most honeheaded general must realize this . " Of course , soldiers did in fact kill thousands of demonstrators , but these killings only weakened the Shah 's hold on the nation . The economic and political measures that had made his government a regional superpower left him powerless within his own borders . Even the military help of the United States was of no use . President Carter , wishing to show American support for the Shah , ordered an aircraft-carrier task force to sail from the Philippines into the Persian Gulf , but before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be credible , a show of force must threaten some move that can at least theoretically be made , but in the Iranian situation there simply was no suitable action for an aircraft carrier to take ; you can not stop a revolution with bombs . Force , which is often said to be the final arbiter in political affairs , was stalemated . The instruments of violence were all in the hands of the Shah , but power , it turned out , resided in the Iranian people . ? ? Restrained Toy THERE was good news out of the New York Public Library last week to cheer the more than six hundred and thirteen thousand people from New York and around the world writers , scholars , fashion de-signers , patent lawyers , magazine researchers , horseplayers , cartoonists , oil executives , college students , and general readers  --  who during the last fiscal year consulted , free of charge , something like two and a half million hooks , manuscripts , posters , prints , broadsides , clay tablets , and periodicals in the library 's noncirculating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because it was one of the few times since the late sixties that library officials had more good news than bad news to report , they were experiencing what Richard Salomon , the chairman of the library 's board of trustees , called " restrained joy . " Thanks to two **45;5998;TOOLONG gif ts  --  one from the Gladys Kneble Delmas Foundation ( Mrs. Delmas is a scholar who uses the library a lot in researches into English literature and incunabula ) and the other from Time , Inc. ( one of the many New York corporations that use the library 's books and maps and manuscripts and documents every week ) the two-block-long Main Reading Room of the library 's central building , at Fifth Avenue and Forty-second Street ( a room connecting to eighty miles of shelves in the main stacks ) , will now be open until 9 P.M. three nights a week , Mondays , Tuesdays , and Wednesdays , instead of only on Tuesdays . At the same time , the library has reallocated some other money to open several of its special divisions  --  Rare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arents Collections  --  at ten in the morning five days a week , like the Main Reading Room , instead of at one in the afternoon . The library is still closed all day Thursdays and Sundays , and it is still open only until 6 P.M. on Fridays and Saturdays , but it is now open forty-nine hours a week instead of forty-three , as it had been since June of 1976 . ' What restrained the joy ? Bad news of the familiar sort : the city had just proposed cutting half a million dollars from its contribution to the library 's budget for 1979-80 . If the cut should be sustained , it would affect only the hours of service and the numbers of new books bought for the eighty-odd branch libraries that the New York Public Library maintains in Manhattan and the Bronx and on Staten Island , since the city , together with the state , pays the library to operate the branches but pays only for maintenance and security at the central building . The cut , therefore , would not affect the library 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exchange , about a hundred and fifty thousand new hooks and other documents a year for the Research Libraries  --  the standard number of annual acquisitions for the only metropolitan research library to he ranked with the Library of Congress , the British Library , the Bibliothkpie Nationale , the Lenin State Library , in Moscow , and the Harvard University Library as one of the greatest libraries in the world . Except for Harvard , the New York Public Library ( exclusive of its branches ) is the only great library that buys its hooks mostly with private funds . Like the Bronx Zoo and the American Museum of Natural History and many of New York 's other treasures , the library is a private institution ; its endowment for the Research Libraries , together with the financial support received every year from more than forty thousand individuals and corporations and foundations , amounts to more money than the Research Libraries get from all government sources . But various city cuts in the last decade have had their effect . In the past , when money ran free , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact , from May 2:3 , 1911 , when President Taft cut a ribbon to inaugurate New York 's palace of hooks , which the city built for the library over a period of nine years and spent nine million dollars on -- it has walls of Vermont marble , Philippine-teak floors , French-walnut panelling , gold leaf on the ceiling of the Main Reading Room , and , of course , the lions  --  the library was open every day until V-E Day , which was spontaneously declared a holiday . As recently as November , 1970 , the library was open eighty-seven hours a week : from 9 A.M. to 10 P.M. Monday through Saturday , and from 1 P.M. to 10 P.M. on Sundays and holidays . At that time , the city started kicking in less money , whereupon the senior library staff petitioned the trustees not to take any irreversible steps ; they meant that it was better to cut hours , which could always he restored later , than to stop buying hooks , which if they were once passed up might never again he available . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I learn something new about this library every day I 'm here , " we were told by Richard Salomon , who had invited its over to his office for a corned-beef sandwich and a Pepsi and a briefing on the latest developments . " Did you know it takes an hour just to walk through all the rooms here ? Speaking as a levelheaded businessman , I have never seen such treasures , so much romance . " Salomon , who is dapper , affable , and , currently , full of delight , sold his Family business , Lanvin-Charles of the Ritz , to Squibb eight years ago , when none of his sons wanted to go into the business , and he now sits on the boards of Squibb , Channel 13 , and Brown University . He got involved in the library a couple of years ago after telling one of his sons that he did n't have enough to do . " I 'm so pleased with the new gifts that have extended our hours  --  particularly because the money is coming from people and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm going to he talking to more of them . Being a trustee is a very different business these days from what it was when Washington Irving became president of the Astor Library , one of our two predecessor libraries . Or when an uncle of mine was on the hoard of a French hospital at the turn of the century . His only job was to meet with the other trustees at the end of the year , find out what the deficit was , and then make it up out of his own pocket . To day , if the library is going to get more public support , we have to become more open and welcoming , and show ourselves off . Have you seen the beautiful exhibit hall downstairs ? Probably not  --  it has been cut up into office space since 1932 , when we first started to bulge at the seams . It 's one of my projects to get that room hack  --  after we start opening on Thursdays . We probably have just enough space to last until the end of the century @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stand hooks on their long edges now in the stacks , so they wo n't stand so high . Have you seen the stacks ? Fourteen current university presidents were once pages in our stacks . The hooks are dustier than they used to he , because the city ca n't pay for porters to dust them anymore , but perhaps that is fortunate ; a recent theory suggests that dust helps preserve hooks from deterioration . But what ahout the honks printed since 1850 ? That 's when books started to he printed on pulp paper that has an acid content that turns the paper itself into dust eventually . Luckily , we do n't have to worry about that with our current phone books . We have phone hooks from virtually every community in the United States and from hundreds of foreign cities all over the world . Have you seen the Picture Collection ? That consists of two million catalogued pictures from magazines and newspapers and prints , arranged by subject , and it is used every day by cartoonists and illustrators . Have you ever seen the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the world , made , probably , in about 1510 . Richard Morris Hunt , the architect of the Lenox Library , which was our other predecessor institution , picked it up in a little Paris shop and brought it home for his kids to play with . Eat up ! I have to show you these things , because how could I describe them ? " We ate up , and Salomon gathered a couple of colleagues  --  Mrs. Susan Lamb , vice-president for development , and Walter Zervas , administrative associate  --  and whirled us around the building . And we kept wondering , How could anyone describe this place  --  the things it has , the use it gets ? At the little souvenir shop in the main hall , after our tour , we bought the " Guide to the Research Collections of the New York Public Library , " to see if we could begin to suggest an answer . This is a three-hundred-page scholarly book , in eight-point type , two columns to a page , that does nothing but describe what 's in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what 's in a human mind . " I 'll miss you . ' Mary ' is a grand old zame . " Anyway , we took it home and poked through it , and here are a few things the library has : six card drawers listing books in the collection which were printed before 1521 ; the first book ever written and printed in the Ladino language , " Regimento de la Vida " ( 1564 ) ; the Spencer Collection , of finely illustrated hooks , which includes a tenth-century palm-leaf manuscript from northern India , and also includes a copy of Firdausi 's " Shah Narnali , " or " Book of Kings , " made for Shah Abbas the Great , of Persia , in 1614 , with forty-four illustrations ; the two Arents Collections , one of books in parts , like the Dickens novels that appeared in serial form , and one of anything to do with tobacco , which has an original Thomas Nast drawing of Santa Claus smoking a pipe , the drawing that standardized the image of Santa Claus for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fifteen thousand hooks , which includes the " Arha Turim , " by Jacob ben Asher , printed on vellum in Italy in 1475 and probably the first dated hook ever printed in Hebrew , and also includes an English translation of the first Jewish sermon preached in America ( it was delivered in Spanish by Rabbi Haim Isaac Carigal at Newport on May 28 , 1773 ) ; the Rare Book Division , which has the first book printed in the American colonies ( the Bay Psalm Book , printed in Massachusetts in 1640 , of which there are eleven copies left ) , the first Gutenberg Bible brought to this country ( only the first leaf is missing ) , Mrs. Helen Hay Whitney 's collection of two hundred cookbooks , Walt Whitman 's own heavily corrected and revised copy of the 1860 edition of " Leaves of Grass " ( when the Secretary of the Interior found this hook in Whitman 's desk , he dismissed him from the department ) ; the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture , on West 135th Street , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lemuel Haynes , a black minister who was pastor to a white congregation in Rutland , Vermont , for thirty years ; and , here and there in the library , a Chinese mulberry-bark banknote of the Ming dynasty , a thousand books printed in Latin America before 1800 , the original manuscript of " A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur 's Court " and the corrected typescript of " The Waste Land " ( both in the Berg Collection ) , every issue of the New York Post ( founded in 1801 ) , practically every issue of The Sporting News ( founded in 1886 ) , silver annual passes for New York Giants baseball games which were designed by Charles Dana Gibson , a hundred and fifty English-language editions of Izaak I'Valton 's " The Compleat Angler , " thirty-five hundred books in Latvian , and a hundred and twenty books in Sorbian , the language of well over a hundred thousand Slays who live in East Germany . And what about Shakespeare ? Five first folios , ten second folios , three third folios , and four fourth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind that the library acquires a hundred and fifty thousand new books and other pieces of material every year . " The New York Public Library , " says James W. Henderson , former Andrew W. Mellon Director of the Research Libraries , in his preface to the book , " is , in actuality , a universe of libraries containing virtually every kind of library collection and service yet described . " Stationery AS we were just about to step off a curb , our friend Janet plunged out of the hack door of a No. 7 bus flourishing a piece of paper . " This reminded me of a story I meant to tell you last winter . Where were you ? " she said . We shrugged . " Everything was on sale all over town , " she said . " I was at my bank on Fifty-first Street , so Saks was the nearest . I went around to all the reduced counters there , and I ended up in reduced stationery . I asked the saleswoman , ' What are those plastic things ? ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ openers . ' I looked at the plastic things more closely . Three of them said ' Leslie R. Parker , ' two said ' Lawrence Markman , ' and my favorite one said Steven H. Glovstky ' ? which reminded me of my ex-husband 's name . Which E do n't use . A name like that you have to spell all the time . You spend your whole life spelling . I thought it would be nice to send the ' Steven H. Glovstky ' to my friend Joe . However , I asked if it was reduced from eight-forty to what , and the saleswoman said no , it was reduced from fourteen dollars for a name of your choosing down to eight dollars and forty cents for either Leslie , ' Lawrence , ' or ' Steven . ' I said I thought two dollars would be enough for a joke . She said the buyer had reduced the merchandise and there was nothing she could do about it . I said I 'd like to speak to the buyer . She said , ' You ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the service manager , around the corner . ' I stood in line while the service manager was taking hack personalized gift items , and when it was my turn I asked to have a Lucite letter opener with the name ' Steven H. G/ovstky ' reduced to two dollars , as I JAN Mai 2. 9 , 1979 was planning to give it to someone named Joe . Or maybe Ed . The service manager said to me and I wrote these very words down ? " Janet checked the piece of paper , and read , " ' It is not the policy of the store to negotiate sales items with a customer . ' " She went on , " So I ended up buying a key chain that was n't reduced . " We nodded , and stepped off the curb . A Theatre Life AH , to be stage-struck all one 's life , despite loud protestations to the contrary ! Oh , to be able to play with Mies Anderson and Miss Cornell when one is in , or barely out of , one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Theatre and some summer stock already behind one I Ah , to be able to dedicate one 's life when one is very young , and never deviate ! Such is the story of Marian Seldes , at present acting in " Deathtrap , " Ira Levin 's eminently playable but strangely mirthless and charmless comedy thriller . Now , midway in her career , she has published a book ? " The Bright Lights : A Theatre Life " ( Houghton Mifflin ) . Tall in her flat shoes , dark-haired , pair , fast-moving , finely bred , and regal , Marian Seldes goes around in the evening in a black velvet coat , and carries an old-fashioned square silk bag with a gold clasp , inherited from her Aunt Marian . " It was taken away from me , darling , right here on the street , " she said to us the other evening . " The only reason I got it back was that I screamed so loud it was recovered almost immediately . " M a ri an Seldes was always articulate . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which made her suspect , because it was generally thought that hrains tended to inhibit Method acting . Still , she knows instinctively how to scream very loud in order to recover her handbag . This young woman does n't covet anything that money can buy . At the mention of a mink coat : " Darling , I have THE NEW YORKER one from my aunt . One of those old ones  --  only it 's warm , and I love it . " Speak of a maid to clean up ? " My dear darling , I 've never had a maid . What would I do with a maid ? " She is looking for appreciation , she says . " Desperately . I fall right into that line . I think I 'm honest , though , in saying it 's a need for appreciation more than for approval . I want whatever work I do to be recognized . " It is . Back at the Playhouse , if a teacher wanted a paper , Marian Seldes was always the one to comply . Most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a voice teacher  --  never from the acting teacher , Sanford Meisner . Because Marian Seldes is the daughter of the playwright and critic Gilbert Seldes ( " When you are growing up , my darling , and the man you most admire is in theatre . . . " ) , Sanford Meisner would call her out to one of his improvisations with a pitiless " Miss Bel Geddes " Marian would blush  --  she was always a great blusher , which tempted the students as well as the teachers  --  and keep very quiet . And then Meisner would tell his blush story : Eleonora Dose , alone , stage center , playing an old woman . The maid comes in to announce a visitor . He is her love : of long ago . At which point , Duse 's face is overtaken by such a flush that she automatically hides it in her hands . That was Meisner 's " Blush and Best Actress " story . No student ever forgot it . Marian Seldes has always danced . First at the School of American Ballet . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later , she appeared with Martha Graham 's company in " Mendicants of Evening . " And in 1977 she danced , and played the tide role , in " Isadora Duncan Sleeps with the Russian Navy , " in Wynn Hand-man 's American Place Theatre . Her first stage credit was as a super in a 1942 Ballet Theatre production of " Petrouchka , " at the old Metropolitan Opera House . On the " Today " show , Marian Seldes gives a voluble performance . She imitates Miss Anderson . Her first professional role on Broadway was that of one of Miss Anderson 's attendants in " Medea , " directed by John Giclgud . Then came " Crime and Punishment , " directed by Theodore Komisarjevsky . When " Crime and Punishment " folded , Gielgud was kind enough to plant her right back in " Medea . " Where does an actress begin ? Not necessarily with a struggle . Marian Seldes ' father thought his friend Robert Edmond Jones , the famous stage designer , could guide her . He lived in the building . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1945 , " she writes in her book , " I put on my best dress , navy-blue with accordion pleats and a white organdy collar ; nylon stockings ; and patent-leather shoes . I walked down the stairs and knocked on the oak double doors ; a tall , gentle man with a birdlike body a gentle eagle  --  asked me to come into the dining room , where he worked and ate at an enormous table . ' Sit here . We 'll have B. and B. and cake . Will that be all right ? ' Fascinated by his bright , staring eyes , not knowing what B. and B. was , I nodded and obeyed . I loved the warmth and sting of it and tried to drink it slowly , so that the time with him would last . He told me stories about the theatre . He acted for me in a bizarre , funny way . I felt i was seeing Sarah Bernhardt rip the bracelets off her arms in Phedre . ' I wanted to shout ' Bravo ! ' and laugh at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his mood and made me weep . I do n't know how long I was there . I came back to the eighth floor and kissed my parents good night and wrote him a letter . " Two weeks later , Jones sent for her . He meant to deter her , hut , of course , the maneuver was useless . From the time she had played an angel in a school pageant at Dalton , all deterrents had been useless . What is surprising is how few of them there were . Instead of going to college , she went to the Neighborhood Playhouse . She had sent in college applications , and had been accepted , but there was no question of her going to college ; directly after school came " Medea , " in which she played One of Miss Anderson 's attendants . For thirty-seven dedicated years now , she has been working in the theatre . For almost three years , she was in " Equus ; " she played both female leads  --  Hester end Dora . Of theatre life she writes perspicaciously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all . It is a book about acting : about the chemistry of acting and of the stage . She writes with great exactitude . She should . She teaches in both the Drama and the Dance Departments of Juilliard . Although Marian Seldes is still not recognized on the street , she has reached a measure of fame . At Sardi 's , where she sups off antipasto after " Deathtrap , " and calls the waiter " darling , " her caricature hangs on the wall above her .
