The waterfront boss is convicted in Manhattan <P> As a vice president of the International Longshoremen 's Association and head of its Local 1814 in Brooklyn , Anthony Scotto , 45 , has long been laden with two very different reputations . A personable and articulate man who favors $500 pinstripe suits and expensive Manhattan restaurants , Scotto has lectured at Harvard University on labor relations , serves as a trustee of the Brooklyn Academy of Music and counts some of New York 's most prominent politicians among his friends . But because of his occupational affiliation with the city 's notoriously corrupt waterfront and his 1957 marriage to the niece of Mobster Albert Anastasia , police considered Scotto to be a criminal . In 1969 , the FBI went so far as to identify him as a capodecina , or lieutenant , in the Mafia family of Carlo Gambino , an allegation that the union leader vehemently denied . <P> For ten weeks , the two images of Scotto have clashed in a federal courtroom in Manhattan where he was tried on 44 counts of accepting illegal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , after deliberating for five days , the jury found Scotto guilty on 33 of the charges . Convicted with him was Anthony Anastasio , executive vice president of Local 1814 . <P> The major charges against Scotto were that he had accepted $300,000 over five years from two dockside businessmen , William Montella Jr . and Walter D. O'Hearn Jr . As evidence , the prosecution produced 27 tape recordings from FBI eavesdropping on Scotto 's conversations over a period of five months . On one 1978 tape , he could be heard accepting $5,000 in cash from Montella in the men 's room of a New York City hotel . Montella , the onetime owner of a marine carpentry company , testified that the payment was supposed to help prevent labor troubles . <P> Montella was hardly a model witness . He told the court that he could go to jail for " 100 years " if he confessed all his past crimes . Said he : " On the waterfront , no business is completely honest . " Montella even explained how to persuade a reluctant bar owner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair blower , " he instructed the rapt court , " get it hot and put it on his neck until he signs . He 'll sign . " <P> The trial also produced evidence that Scotto , who is paid a salary of $120,000 a year by Local 1814 , operated in a style far removed from the grimy docks . Montella testified , for example , that he had built Scotto a swimming pool cabana for free at his Catskills summer home . Scotto answered that he had paid $10,200 for this work but that he had paid in cash . Scotto also acknowledged that he acquired a 13% interest in a multimillion-dollar East Side apartment building for only $26 . He dealt mainly in cash , he said , to thwart the continuous harassment by Government agents . <P> Scotto admitted receiving a total of $75,000 from Montella and O'Hearn but insisted that the money was intended for political contributions . The union leader said that he in turn donated $25,000 in cash to New York Governor Carey 's re-election campaign in 1978 and $50,000 in cash through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for mayor of New York City in 1977 . Making political donations of more than $100 in cash is illegal , but Scotto claimed ignorance of the law . Both Carey and Cuomo denied any knowledge of the contributions .
