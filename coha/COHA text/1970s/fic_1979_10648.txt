movie begins and you , James Dean , are lying drunk in a gutter , your face framed in a closeup . Curled childlike about a toy mechanical monkey , your sidekick , you are mooing , mooing , mocking the sirens that blare with anger and danger and with fear from somewhere in the dark adult distance . WhereverI go everything is changed , you moo . At the police station you slouch drunkenly yet Cool in a chair , still mooing , mooing : All I ever wanted was compassion , understanding , love . All I ever wanted was a real chance . In this movie it is Easter . Also at the police station on Easter in this movie are your co-stars Sal Mineo and the beautiful Natalie Wood . Sal Mineo 's movierole Plato , confused , lonely , frightened , is at the police station because he just celebrated his sixteenth birthday by blowing out the brains of five puppies . All he ever wanted also was compassion , understanding , love : especially on his sixteenth birthday , especially on Easter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ police station because she was picked up walking the dark adult streets alone . Her father had called her a tramp because of the ruby red lipstick on her sweet teen lips . She had run out of the house into the dangerous adult night to suffer , perhaps to die . It is chilly in the police station on Easter and Natalie Wood 's movierole Judy looks cold so , wrinkling your forehead and arching your eyebrows and letting your lower face collapsep31into smiles , which is your most magic Cool look , as tender or tough as you need it to be , you tenderly offer her your sportcoat . She nervously refuses , her full , rich , ruby red lips trembling so childlike , breaking your heart . With her love I might make it after all , you think . Some movie , you think . Some co-star . At last your folks show up , called from an Easter party , dressed to the gills . Immediately your dear old moviemom begins to moan that now the family will have to move once again , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the towns before when you got into trouble , when you fell into disgrace . It 's the same old song and dance , your moviemom moans . Your movie dad , starring Jim Backus , offers a fat Havana to the tough but understanding cop who is in charge of your case . The boy just got a little loaded on Easter is all , your movie dad says , laughing nervously . Right , Jimbo ? he says , still laughing . Just tied one on to celebrate Easter . The tough but understanding cop takes you into his office for a little heart-to-heart . They 're a circus , you tell him about your family . Why did you have to leave the last town ? he asks you . I beat a kid up . I beat him up real bad , you say , wrinkling your forehead . Why , son ? I had to , you tell him , arching your eyebrows . He called me chicken . The tough but understanding cop continues to ask you touchy questions . Finally , on cue , you take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then shoves you into a chair and takes his coat off ready for your teenage action . He suggests that if you want to hit something and stay out of trouble why not take on his desk ? Really ? you ask , your lower face collapsing into smiles . Sure , he says , why not ? In a closeup the tough but understanding cop 's face flinches with pain and recognition and , most of all , with adult guilt as you beat your fists bloody against the desk . You moan . You moo . You moan . You were not born to survive . You will never grow old in America . In a closeup your face , wrinkled , arched , collapsed , is Cool perfectly in its pain . On that mythic Friday night he first saw Rebel Without ap32Cause , Jimbo Stark slouched out of the Palace Theatre as James Dean 's moviedouble and was for the first time in his life Cool . But Jimbo soon discovered that it was not easy to stay Cool . He had to practice . He had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It took him months to master his Cool slouch . And in every reflecting surface he encountered , mirrors , plate-glass windows , hubcaps , Jimbo practiced his Cool expressions like piano : arching his eyebrows , wrinklinghis forehead , letting his lower face collapse into smiles , until his flesh ached with the effort . But more difficult than these things was the never-ending effort it took for Jimbo to be truly intense , to be sensitive , to be confused , to be misunderstood , and , most important , to suffer . Ultimately , Jimbo became the most intense , sensitive , confused , misunderstood , suffering James Dean moviedouble in his whole highschool . He resigned his positions as vicepresidentof the sophomore class and as treasurer of the science club . He was tossed off both the basketball and track teams for public drunkenness . He started cutting classes and smoking in the washrooms . He started keeping a pint of vodka in his hall locker . He got into fights . Finally the principal of Central High called Jimbo into his office for a heart-to-heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years earlier taught Jimbo 's old man highschool algebra . The kindly old principal had taken an interest in Jimbo and was truly distressed that Jimbo had started to go bad . He lectured Jimbo about how he could be a real credit to his family and his community and even his country someday , son , if only he applied himself like he once had . A lawyer perhaps , or a doctor or engineer . Who knows ? The sky is the limit in America , son . Now , it is supposed to be confidential information but maybe you should know that according to our tests you have the third-highest IQ in the whole highschool , son , so there 's absolutely no reason for your poor showing of late . But there was a reason , Jimbo said , arching his eyebrows and wrinkling his forehead and slouching ever deeper in thep33chair in front of the principal 's desk . I am , Jimbo explained patiently in his special quiet , faltering voice : confused , misunderstood . Then , to the kindly old principal 's astonishment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poundinghis fists against the desk . With actual tears in his kindly old eyes , the principal suspendedJimbo until such a time as he decided to sincerely shape up , son , and fly right . Jimbo spent the rest of that morning playing pinball machines in the greasy-spoon diner across the street from the highschool . At lunch hour he had his pal Pace give him a lift to the edge of town . Tell them you last saw me heading down the Mississippi on a raft with a runawaynigger , Jimbo said to Pace and winked . Jimbo slouched to the side of the road and stuck out his thumb . Jimbo 's old man had to drive over three hundred miles to pick Jimbo up after he was caught hitchhiking by a nosy sheriff . After picking Jimbo up at the county jail Jimbo 's old man checked them into a local motel for a night 's rest before the long trip home . Jimbo 's old man was grim . Jimbo preparedhimself for pain . The first thing Jimbo 's old man did when they got into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hide the screams and pleas for mercy , Jimbo figured . But Jimbo 's old man was strangely quiet and he just sat there on the end of the bed , not even taking his overcoat off , elbows on his knees , his huge hands flopped like fish between his legs . Old Popeye the Sailor cartoons were on the teevee , but Jimbo 's old man did n't change channels or anything . Jimbo sat in a chair in the corner waiting for his old man to make his move . But his old man just sat there looking like a worn-out John Wayne after a roundup or something . That 's who he was a deadringer for all right , Jimbo thought . John fucking Wayne . Everyone said so . After a time the teevee began to roll but Jimbo 's old man did n't do anything about it . He just sat there on the end of the bed watching old Popeye and Olive Oyl rolling on the screen as though that was the way the cartoon was meant to be . More time passed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he got up to adjust the set himself . As Jimbo passedp34by suddenly his old man jumped up and grabbed him by the front of his shirt . Oh Jesus , this is it , Jimbo thought . Jimbo 's old man pulled Jimbo 's face so near his own Jimbo could smell his breath . It struck Jimbo that this was the closest he had been physically to his old man since he was a kid and for some reason he suddenly felt more embarrassed than frightened . His old man 's breath smelled like whiskey and wintergreen mints . Jimbo could smell his old man 's Old Spice after-shave . Images of the teevee screen were gathered like crazy moons in the centers of his old man 's thick glasses and instead of his eyes Jimbo could see only those rolling cartoons . Finally , after what seemed hours , Jimbo 's old man just shook his head slowly and let Jimbo 's shirt front loose . A little later they went out to a diner for sandwiches , then returned to the room where they spent the rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about that night years earlier when his old man had taken him for the first time to discover television , and how for a long time television had been a sort of hobby for them . It had been the only way they could usually talk . They would sit watching teevee , making jokes and comments about the shows , as though teevee were some strange medium they , ghosts from different dimensions , different channels , had to filter themselves through to talk . But even that had long ago ended . They had to sleep in the same bed together that night in the motel . Jimbo lay there on the edge of his side as still as death . He hardly breathed . He stared at the ceiling . He was afraid to close his eyes . He did not want to fall asleep . He was afraid that if he did fall asleep he might roll over somehow and touch his old man . Jimbo 's old man 's nickname was Captain . He got it early in boyhood , when as the boldest and toughest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Captain . He was preparedat any moment at any place to monster-fart , to ape a cripple , to fake a fit . He would take any dare , would waterballoonor snowball old ladies , teachers who might recognizep35him , copcars , the blind . He would howl insanely from bushes beside old maids ' windows . He would ring their bells , then ( lash into the giggle-filled darkness , leaving against their doors leaning Coke bottles of steamy squirt piss . He would stuff three fingers down his throat and off any movie theatre balconyin town puke like a dog . On the morning after the December 7 , 1941 , low-down Nip sneak attack on Pearl Harbor , Captain led a crew of his local buddies down to the recruitment office two hours before it opened . The enlistment line would begin behind them , by God . They waited there in a freezing rain . They stamped their feet and cursed and blew in their cupped hands- Some of them were drunk . Boomer , Captain 's best friend and sidekick since childhood , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mortician 's son and he had been a clown all his life . He was the town 's most feeble twenty-year-old coughing drunk and no one took him seriously at all . It was a joke that he was standing right behind Captain waiting to sign up for the Second World War . Now and then Boomer would try to musterthe boys in line into a patriotic song , but most everyone ignored him . Most everyone just stood there in the cold rain grimly . Captain did not sing along with Boomer either , but he was not grim . Captain was not even particularly cold . Captain had never been happier in his life . Because he had attended a military school all through highschooland for two years of college Captain entered the army as a second lieutenant and after basic training and officers ' school was sent to Fort Benning in Georgia as an instructor . After being stuck stateside until he almost despaired , until he felt almost as rejected by the Second World War as Boomer had been , Captain was shipped finally to the European @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first time at the Battle of the Bulge . It had been near Christmas and presents and even fruitcakes from Mom had been flown to the troops and for weeks they had been capturing mere Nazi boys and old men . The Nazis were whipped , by God , and the Alliesp36were confident in Christmas that year , confident it would be jolly and white and perhaps even star Bob Hope or Bing . Then , suddenly , in night assaults Nazis were coming down the chimney and Bastogne was surrounded and there were rumors of American prisoners being massacred , boys being taken by truckloads to lonely snowy fields and there machine-gunned down like dogs . Captain had been a hero in that Christmas battle all right . He had held his position and he had led a daring Christmas counterattack . And for the rest of his life Nazi panzers would push relentlessly through the it winter woods of his Christmas dreams , emerging suddenly out of the swirling snow , emerging always silently in his Christmas dreams from the snow-white forests to roll across the frozen open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to lieutenant . Ij All in all Captain 's picture was in the town 's local newspaperfive times during the duration and twice it even made the front page of the state 's biggest newspaper , making him truly famous . The picture the newspapers published was always the same one , the photo taken just before Captain was shipped overseas , in which he is in full uniform and is smiling a wide , toothy , confident smile . Captain 's young bride dutifullysaved a dozen clippings each time his picture appeared , even during the dark days of the strange laughter behind II closed doors and the parade of new uncles for Jimbo . She kept them in her hope chest , along with the linens and monogrammedtowels , the china and the silver settings , all the wedding gifts she hoarded for the time the world became real once again . How or exactly when Jimbo got to the clippings she did not know . One of those lonely , rainy afternoons she overnipped and napped perhaps . She wept when she first found them . But later , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come accidentally across them and laugh , enjoying them , enjoying the Captain 's goofy crayoned face , the blacked-out teeth , the red mustaches and green beards , the pointy purple piggy ears , the crossed cartoon eyes . Captain was at some point somehow promoted to Captainp37of the Second World War and for years and years afterward this illuminated his life . So Jimbo 's old man , his daddy , is coming home a hero from France . France is across an ocean . Jimbo tries to imagine France . He tries to imagine an ocean . Who are you going to vote for when you grow up ? big people ask Jimbo . Not that Harry Truman , Jimbo tells them cutely and they laugh and laugh . Where is your daddy ? they ask him . In France shooting Hitler , Jimbo says cutely and they laugh and laugh . Jimbo tries to imagine Hitler and shooting and he tries to imagine his daddy with a tommy gun doing it . Rat-a-tat-tat , like in the movies , Jimbo imagines , and Hitler grabs his spilling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far below . Lots of people go to meet Jimbo 's daddy at the train station . There is a band playing and later a parade . But does Jimbo really rememberthis ? Does he really remember the station or band or parade ? He does remember loud voices coming from somewhere in the house . But is he asleep ? Perhaps he is dreaming . Should he be frightened ? The room is suddenly so noisy and bright and Jimbo 's eyes are so sleepy . He is being lifted up so high . The room is full of big people . He is being kissed and kissed and his neck is nuzzled and for the first time he smells his daddy . I have everything you sent me from the army , Jimbo tells his daddy . Jimbo sits in his daddy 's lap and in one of his favorite books points out all the words he has somehow magicallycome to know . When he asks his daddy if he is going to live here now all the time his daddy laughs and hugs Jimbo tightly and tells Jimbo he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A beautiful waiting wife . A healthy **25;6049;TOOLONG boy . A world made safe . Nearly two thousand bucks won at poker on the ship home . A waiting job managing old Uncle Bob 's appliance store , good enough for the time being , good enough for a start . Then the whole goddamn town turns out at the train station . A band , the mayor , a state senator , a parade . So pert and pretty , so sweet/smelling this waiting wife , this cute , slightly daffy June Allysondreambride of his memory . But these signals she claims she gets from God . And this strange , quiet little kid who can read at three . Hell , I could hardly talk at three . But , hell , two thousand bucks , a shiny new Ford , some snazzy furniture , brand-new appliances , cute little house . Maybe later a shop in the basement and a big Lionel train set for the kid . Damn right . A shiny new Ford for drives on warm summer evenings with the little lady and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , looking in the picture windows of the big brick homes , checking the fancy layouts for decoration ideas , or sometimes just cruising around town singing songs together , the kid even piping in , harmonizing on the old sweetheart torchtunes , picking up some vanilla icecream on the way home . In the middle of this new life you return home from driving around town one warm summer evening , your boy sleepy in the backseat , your little lady humming softly along with a song on the radio , the vanilla icecream getting nice and melty the way you like it . You pull your new Ford , which you washed and waxed that afternoon , into your driveway . You click off the headlights and then for a few moments just sit there waiting for the song to end , just sit there enjoying the smell of the summer evening and of your wife and the new smell of the Ford 's interior . Well , you say , turning off the radio and engine and patting your little lady 's thigh , you tote the icecream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of your new Ford and stretch . The glow of the streetlight is silvery on the leaves of the frontyard maples and over the old bricks of the street and the lawns shine like snow . You rub your eyes , yawning , then open the backseat door and gently shake your boy awake . You pick him up , enjoying as always the clean boysmell of his hair . Still half asleep , he wraps his arms around your neck . As you wait for your little lady you gaze about . You just ca n't get over how beautifully strange everything seems tonight , the rich smells , the way the neighborhood shines in the streetlight 's glow ,  |p39grainy  and mysterious somehow , like an old-timey photograph , and you have this haunting feeling you somehow have been here in this exact time and place before but just ca n't quite remember when . Captain , hey , Captain , someone huskily whispers from your neighbor Bill Fox 's front porch next door . In that same instant you notice that your neighbor across the street , Pat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sitting at the top of his front porch steps . By the glow of the streetlight you see that he is sitting there in the dark holding in his remaining hand , his right , a shiny , nickel-plated pistol . He 's already shot out in the yard twice , Bill Fox pants as he emerges suddenly from the dark of his yard . He says he 's gon na shoot Mabel when she gets home . He 's drunk as a skunk . We already called the sheriff . Then you realize that the porches all along the street are buzzing with whispering neighbors . Oh sweet Jesus , your little lady whispers . Here , take the boy , you say calmly , handing him gently to your little lady . Then you , Captain , Captain , Captain , stroll slowly down your driveway into the sweet , luminous street . You stop in its dead center , a glowing bell of streetlight about you , and call calmly : Pat . Pat , old boy , it 's Captain . Oh sweet Jesus , no , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on back here . Honey , she calls , come back . Pat Massy jerks suddenly up to his feet and stands there3 weaving on his porch 's top step . He waves the pistol about , its metal gleaming silvery in the streetlight . Who goes there ? he yells . It 's just me , Captain , you say , or someone says , for somehow you are outside yourself . You feel as though you are outside yourself looking at yourself . You are a neighbor in this momentseeing yourself from a neighbor 's front porch and in this sight suddenly your life has a clarity it has never had before . You walk slowly on across the street and through Pat Massy 's frontyard up to his steps . In your ringing ears the intensep40whispering of the neighbors is like wind of insects . You feel strangely light-headed , dizzy almost . Your mouth tastes like brass , but it is sweet . You have never been happier . Not even as a boy . Not even in your war . Who goes there ? Pat Massy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on you , the pistol held limply now at his side , the stump of his left arm twitching randomly as though a thing independent of his thin body . Who goes there ? he mumbles again and his gold front teeth gleam . He slumps back down to sit on the top step again . It 's just me , Captain , you say quietly , taking out and lighting a cigarette , then offering it to him . What , with my stump ? Pat Massy says , still trying to focus his wet , runny eyes on you . Vomit covers his shirt front and pants . Hold it with my stump . Is that how ? I ca n't hold it with this hand , he says , shaking the pistol in the air . I got to hold my gun in this hand ' cause it 's the only goddamn hand I got so fuck your cigarette , see ! Why do n't you just put the gun away , Pat . You do n't need it . The shit I do n't need it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet again , then , failing , falling back to his seat . The shit I do n't . I need this gun to stick up Mabel 's whore pussy and pull the goddamn trigger . I 'm gon na stick it up in there and blast away . I 'm gon na blow Mabel 's whore pussy to hell . You do n't mean that , Pat . That 's just bad trouble is all , old buddy . The sheriffs patrol car , siren off and lights out , glides slowly up in front of the house and stops . Sheriff Dipero and his deputy , Bob , get out . Both are carrying shotguns . Is that Mabel , that cocksucking whore ? Pat Massy mumbles , trying to focus his eyes on the sheriff and his deputy . That 's no one , do n't worry , you tell him and calmly wave back the officers , old friends of yours who will be confident you have the situation well in hand . Now , come on , Pat , old buddy . Let 's put the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a drink . By God , I could use a goodp41stiff shot . Let 's tie one on and talk about it all . How 's that , old buddy ? Gon na blow Mabel 's pussy a new hole . You do n't mean that , Pat . You do n't really want to do that . Fuck I do n't . Just ' cause you were n't man enough . What , Pat ? I did n't get you , old buddy . Big hero . Just ' cause you did n't have the balls . Big hero . I did n't have what ? Balls ! Balls ! Big hero . Some big shit hero . What 's that mean , Pat ? I do n't get you . Balls ! Buddy , you did n't have ' em plain and simple . Big hero did n't have ' em when it was his turn . I just do n't get you , Pat . Balls , goddamn it ! To shoot your own whore when she had it coming . Should of shot her stinking pussy off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hero 's wife . Big hero 's whore ! Big hero off winning the war . Whore sucked off half the cocks in town . Your first blow , a looping left hook , blasts into the dead center of Pat Massy 's laughing face , arching him backward onto the porch where he thuds heavily . The pistol clatters across the boards . Pat Massy 's legs twitch . Pat Massy vomits like a fountain . Pat Massy 's face seems bird-frail beneath your raining blows , as it breaks up bleeding , its parts shifting strangely about , caving at last inward , until they pull you , Captain , the winner again , from him . Your June Allyson dreambride dutifully clips the front-page article about how you saved the neighborhood and adds it to the other clippings in her collection . They use the same old photo they have always used , the full-uniform , toothy , confident one . As it turns out this is the end of your dreambride'scollection , the end of her longtime hobby , for you , Captain , will never get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Coke and candy handy , soldierboy ? Captain asks . Jimbo nods yes . They are sitting on boxes in back of the appliance store . The only light is from a small lamp on a deskp42across the room and all about them are the darkened shapes of appliances humming like sleeping creatures . Everything else is quiet . Jimbo feels strangely like an intruder in some sort of sanctum . He thinks of the grave-robbing scene in the Wolfman movie and he shivers . At any moment he half expects to hear some floating , spooky radio voice like the one on Lights Out telling him to beware of the unknown , telling him there are things men were not meant to know . Beware of the unknown . Beware of the unknown . Go back . Go back before it is too late . Only the Shadow knows . Only the Shadow knows , Jimbo says to himself and shivers with excitement . He is sitting on boxes in the spooky near-darkness with his dad , and they are going to discover television together . They almost did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jimbo 's mother had been dead set against it . What would your Uncle Bob think about you sneaking around the store at night like a low-down common nigger burglar ? Jimbo 's mother had said , standing at the kitchen sink washing dinner dishes , her back to them , her orange hair glowing in the bright overhead light like filament . It wo n't do any harm , Captain had said . Uncle Bob does n't have to know a thing about it . He never goes by the store at night . They 're the first two television sets in town and we 're displaying them starting tomorrow morning . It wo n't hurt a thing to let the boy see television ahead of his pals . It 'll make him a big shot with his little pals to see television first . Well , I 'm dead set against it , Jimbo 's mother had said and turned around from the sink to glare at Captain . For a few moments Jimbo 's parents remained like that , eyes locked , and Jimbo 's heart sank . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ milk . Nuts , Captain said . Captain takes a long pull from his brown-bagged pint bottle of bourbon . Are you ready , soldierboy ? Captain asks and lightly cuffs Jimbo 's head . Jimbo nods yes , grinning so hard it hurts . Well , here she goes , Captain says and reaches forwardp43to click on the strange machine before them , a small fishbowl embedded in a dark wooden box with knobs . They wait silentlyin the near-darkness . Each time Captain takes another pull from his pint , Jimbo drinks from his Coke . Finally , from the dark depths of the embedded fishbowl an asterisk of light flickers . What the hell , soldierboy , Captain says , laughing , why not sit on your old man 's lap for this big even  --  imbo clutches his Mars bar and Coke as he is lifted suddenly through the air and plopped roughly on Captain 's knee . Television , soldierboy ! Captain says , laughing , and bounces Jimbo up and down on his knee . The Coke is Jimbo 's third of the special evening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the asteriskexplodes into a dazzling starburst of silver light . As the images , shapes , and finally faces begin to slowly form on the screen , Jimbo thinks of the bright aquariums at Murphy 's Five-and-Dime . He thinks of the fish , usually angelfish and goldfish , darting like little pieces of light about the bright aquariums : aquariums whose sides ' thick glass was like a lens which made everything inside seem slightly larger than it actually was and which rarefied the green of the flowing plants and the cool colors of the pebbles , and sometimes a fish would swim up close to one of the sides and hover there , pressing its face near the glass as though it wanted to get a real good look out . The phone is ringing . The phone rings and rings . For a moment Jimbo does not know where he is . He has been dreaming that the back room of the appliance store is actually the inside of a set , a radio , or perhaps even a teevee set , and that the humming appliances are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mysterious electrical parts which magically weave the words , the pictures , out of the thin haunted air . In his dream Jimbo dreams himself a circuit , his bones thin and silvery as filament , the current of his blood electric with flowing images . The phone is ringing . Jimbo opens his eyes and blinks for a moment in confusion . The picture on the small teevee screen is rolling slowly . Jimbo realizes where he is and in the next moment realizes he is stillp44sitting straddled on Captain 's leg . Then , in the next moment , Jimbo realizes in horror that he has pissed his pants . He glances up at Captain 's face . Captain 's chin rests on his chest and his mouth hangs partly open . He is snoring loudly . Jimbo slides off Captain 's leg . There is a large , dark , wet stain on Captain 's pants . Oh no , Jimbo thinks and immediately begins shivering . He pounds his head with his fists . Oh no oh no please oh no please , Jimbo screams inside his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a start . What ? Captainmumbles . What ? He looks around . He puts his face in his hands and shakes his head . The phone is ringing . What the hell ? Captain says and slowly pushes himself up . Who the hell ? The ringing phone is over on the desk beneath the lamp . Captain nearly stumbles twice as he walks stiffly across the room . Hello . Hello . Who ? Oh . Oh yes . Uncle Bob . Yes . No , sir . Well , I had some stuff to do . I had . . . Well , Uncle Bob , I did n't see any harm . No , I 'm not , sir . Not a drop . She did ? Well , sir , that 's not . . . What ? No , I 'm not . Not the least goddamn bit .

Yes , good night . That two-bit goddamn bitch whore ! Captain yells as he slams the receiver down . Jesus goddamn fucking Christ ! Jimbo has never heard Captain curse like this before . Not these words . Jimbo stands shivering in the near-darkness by the boxes , his legs spread wide apart as if he is straddling an invisible saddle , his hands gripping his wet crotch , gripping , pushing , as though he is trying to rub the awful fluid back into his awful flesh where it belongs . Bracing himself often on boxes and appliances , Captain walks slowly back across the room . He is shaking his head and muttering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standsp45quietly looking at the rolling teevee . Then he looks suddenly at Jimbo and Jimbo jerks with a start . Jimbo ca n't stop shivering . Can you beat that ? Captain says to Jimbo . She went and called Uncle Bob . She called Uncle Bob and leaked to him we were down here watching the new teevee set . Now why in the world ? Why in the goddamn world ? Captain shakes his head and looks back to the teevee set . Why in the world ? he mumbles . Why in the world ? For a few moments he just stands there in the near-darkness quietly shaking his head . Then , suddenly , he reaches out , roughing Jimbo 's hair , and almost yelling says : Well , by God , soldierboy , we just bought ourselves a goddamn dandy teevee set ! Now how 's them apples ! Captain laughs and laughs until tears run down his face . He sits down on a box finally and holds his face in his hands . For a long time he just sits there like that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about . His eyes are wet and shining in the teevee 's light . When his gaze falls on Jimbo he winks broadly . He burps and then begins to faintly hiccup . The paper-bagged pint bottle is lying on its side on a nearby boxtop . Captain picks it up and holding it before his face as though he expects to see through the paper bag shakes it . He puts the bottle to his lips and throwing back his head polishes off whatever is left . Where 's the bottle cap ? Captain mumbles , glancing about . Where 's the cap ? Jimbo does n't say anything . You seen the bottle cap anywhere ? Captain mumbles and awkwardly gets down on his hands and knees . He begins to slowly scoot about , running his hands over the dark floor . You seen the bottle cap anywhere , soldierboy ? Captain mumbles vaguely several times as he crawls around the dark floor among the boxes and appliances searching . Jimbo does n't say anything . Jimbo stands shivering in the light of the teevee , pressing his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Captain says at last . Here it is , by God ! Found the little bugger right here . The bugger was here by this box all the damn time . Captain stands up stiffly and with a flourish of gestures screws the cap on the bottle , then puts it in his suitcoat'sside pocket . All set , Captain says , chuckling , and winks atp46Jimbo . You and me and our own teevee ! Brand-new teevee ! Bound to be the first folks in this goddamn hick town to have one . Now you 'll really be a big shot with your little pals . You 'll be hero of the block . You 'll be boss of teevee . Captain of teevee ! Just wait till she gets a load of teevee . Talk about sin ! Jesus H. Christ ! Captain starts laughing again . He laughs until he chokes . He pulls his handkerchief from his back pocket and almost stuffs it in his mouth to smother the coughs . Whew , Captain says at last , wiping his face with the handkerchief . Whew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at last , Captain makes the discovery . What in the world ? he says and pats his wet pants leg . What in the world ? He pats at the stain , then sniffs his fingers . He pats and pinches and tugs lightly at the stain and then sniffs his fingers again . Jimbo locks his eyes on the rolling teevee . A rippling American flag fills up the screen and the Star-Spangled Banner is being played . Oh say , can you see , Jimbo sings to himself , concentratingtotally on the song 's words , filling his mind with their images . By the dawn 's early light . Bombs bursting in air . I must have spilled my bourbon all over myself , Captain says . Look at the mess I made on myself . Jimbo glances at him . Captain is pinching the wet cloth away from his skin with his thumb and forefinger . He is grinning broadly . Accidents will happen , right , soldierboy ? he says , chuckling . Even to the best of soldierboys . Hey , there , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ? he asks , still chuckling . Jimbo quickly looks back to the rippling flag on the teevee . Blood . That 's what Jimbo has a sudden thought of , almost like a wish . That the dark stain was blood . Blood from a wound in Captain 's leg . A war wound . Like the war wound Captain had told Jimbo about tonight for the first time and had even lifted his shirt to show Jimbo the jagged scar on his side . Shrapnel , Captain had said and asked Jimbo if he wanted to touch it . No , Jimbo had shaken his head shyly . Oh , go on , soldierboy , Captain had said , go on . For luck , he added . In the teevee 's polar light Captain 's flesh had looked as pale as a fish belly and the wide , slightly puffed scar line was purple . Here , for luck , Captain said . He tookJimbo 's handp47and began tracing its forefinger along the thin , hard , crooked ridge of flesh . Jimbo tried to jerk away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flat against the war wound . For luck , soldierboy , Captain had said , laughing , then had launched into another war story . It seemed no matter what had been on the teevee set that night something would occur to remind Captain of an incident of his army days and he had told one war story after another , until at last his stories blurred , cross-faded strangely in Jimbo 's sleepy mind with television . No , not you , Captain says , lightly cuffing Jimbo 's head . You would n't spill any of that good old Coke now , would you ? No , I went and spilled my goddamn bourbon all over me , that 's what happened . And you know , son , it 's probably for the best , by God . If I 'd have drunk it all I might have gotten right down shitfaced . Captain laughs , then , noticing the teevee , says , Hey , soldierboy , that is the flag of the good old U.S. of A. on teevee . Captain tries to adjust the rolling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He turns the volume up full blast . He clicks his heels together , snapping to attention . He smartly salutes the teevee 's rolling signoff . Hey there , soldierboy , attention ! Captain calls out like an order over the blaring bombs bursting teevee signoff . Jimbo snaps to rigid attention and salutes just as he has been drilled to do . Drilled to do , drilled just as he has been drilled how to march correctly , how to left-face , right-face , how to about-face , so that when he does this for visitors perfectly , Captain barking the orders proudly , they always laugh and laugh and comment on what a smart and cute little soldierboy he is.  |p48For  his tenth birthday Jimbo 's parents gave him the best gift he had ever in his life received . His mother had been well enough to work again in her sister Garnet 's beauty parlor and Captain had not only had a good year at the appliance store but had also done well on his moonlight job for the Paramount Collection Agency . They had splurged and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something he had dreamed about , requesting it each Christmas and birthdayfor years , years . Along with it came several short silent films , things like Woody Woodpecker cartoons and Hopalong Cassidy westerns . Jimbo played them again and again , projectingthe magic light against the wall of his darkened bedroom for hours sometimes , often until the machine seemed almost to glow . The small bright rectangle became like a strange window for Jimbo , through which he could watch Hopalong Cassidy , dressed all in black , wearing two shining silvery guns , ride his huge white stallion silently across a luminous western world completely at Jimbo 's will . Jimbo found that if he messed around with the projector he could slow the West down or speed it up . He could stop the West cold . He could make the West run backward , the strangest trick of all , with smoke returning like imploding ghosts to gun barrels and dead men falling upward alive into the movies again . Also , hep49found that if he became weary of the movie he could use the projected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of huge rabbits , big black birds , all sorts of strange creatures , who could eat their way across the western movie at their leisure . Over the years Jimbo had never forgotten how to use the projector correctly . He had never tired of it , ever . He got twenty bucks for the thing . He got a half-dollar each for his twenty white mice and five for the two mousemazes he had built . He sold off his elaborate chemistry set , with all of its gleaming flasks and delicate glass tubing , which when arranged for an experiment looked like some strange miniature shining city of the future . He sold his microscope and his exotic collection of stained slides . He sold the radio he had built whose vacuum tubes he had so often sat softly fondling while thinking strangely of eggs . Finally the telescope . It was a four-inch reflector he had built alone , gently polishing the curved surface of its mirror for weeks , weeks , until it could reflect at last galaxies glowing from even deep space . From a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often spent whole evenings with the telescope , dialing in the seas of the moon , Saturn 's rings , the red moons of Mars : dialing in starry circles of the night sky like celestial teevee channels . Jimbo got thirty bucks for the thing . Still there was n't enough money for the only ring in the whole wide world . Jimbo would lie awake at night in his dark bedroom trying to think of something else to forsake . But there was nothing else . Now this was that summer of strange dreams when Jimbo had begun to make the silver cones , the magic transformers , after having read that story in Fate magazine ( limbo 's favorite magazine ) about how this sensitive , misunderstood , fired L.A. highschool science teacher had stumbled onto a surefire , simpleway to tap in on those fields and flows of ghost energies which haunt the world together . Silver cones , shaped from cardboard and covered carefully with tinfoil , which after removingthe plastic model fighter planes Jimbo had hung fromp50his bedroom ceiling , their points focused evenly upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dreams for the first time . One morning Jimbo woke up unusually refreshed from the strange dreams and he discovered that they had left him with a bright idea . The dreams that night had been dreams of gangsters , of jobs and shootouts and getaways and of gangster deaths . Gangsters take what they need , Jimbo thought , and while they live they live sleek . And gangsters blaze away at death not easily vanishing . Hell , why not become a gangster ? Jimbo thought and yawned and laughed . An outlaw . A desperado . Just like in the movies . Jimbo had long before guessed he could live his life like a movie , and as its star he could become always just what he imagined he was . He did n't have much gangster experience though . Ever since he had become Cool he had been a wildass all right , but he had never been much of a thief . Of course he had shoplifted a little , like that beautiful yo-yo , glossy black with rhinestone stars on both sides . And he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which he had carried in his wallet , their imprints clear through the smooth leather . Not much experience , but he was young and quite willing to learn the trade . From now on he would watch gangster movies sincerely . He would get all the gangster lingo down cold . From that moment on , Jimbo decided , grinning , yawning , stretching in the early morning sunlight , he would plan how to raise the rest of the four hundred bucks for the only ring in the whole wide world in terms of jobs . So you do n't have any idea about what happened to your movie projector ? Captain asks Jimbo in one of his favorite Captain of the Second World War voices , the sort of tough but understanding one , a voice great for talking the frightened punk private out of going over the hill . Your mom and me have to make a lot of sacrifices , son , to get you a swell gift like that movie projector . Do you have any idea how long I have to moonlight to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't know where it is , Jimbo says , hating the whine in his voice . Anyway , you gave me that old thing over six years ago . That , son , is not the goddamn point at hand , Captain says , his voice now one perfect for forced marches through winter woods . Jimbo 's family is sitting around the dinner table , eating , at his mother 's insistence , by candlelight . Something they do often , for , as Jimbo 's mother points out , just because they are n't as filthy rich as some folks does n't mean they ca n't show some class . Tonight by candlelight they are eating waffles . And your mom says that the projector is n't the only goddamnthing missing from around this house , Captain says , drinking from his water glass of scotch and milk and leveling his eyes on Jimbo 's face . Jimbo averts his eyes from Captain 's . He glances at his mother . In the soft candlelight the gauntness of her face is n't so apparent . Her face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she studies her plate where she worries bits of waffle about in the syrup . Screw her , Jimbo thinks . Fucking snooping my room again . Like the last time when she had discovered his Playboy magazines . Un-Christian magazines , she had declared and burned them with great ceremony out back in the barbecue pit . But Jimbo could remember her otherwise . Vaguely now . Always , it seemed , more and more vaguely . Memories of being rocked and sung to , of having his ears tickled with a bobby pin for hours it seemed ; memories of sitting at the kitchen table together whole evenings sometimes , listening to their favorite radio shows , or sometimes she would just talk about their plans together of days-long train rides west to Hollywood where she would be discovered in a drugstore and break into showbiz and become overnight a star , and filthy rich beyond belief they would live in a hilltop mansion with walls of gleaming glass and a swimming pool , its water California sky blue and heated , and he could have a pony with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ train-rode west to Hollywood . Instead they moved in with Garnet , Jim/bo 's mom 's older sister , to wait for Jimbo 's old man to wrap up the war and return home like a parade . And then Jimbo 's memories , still vague , were of his mom and Garnet and of Garnet 's friends sitting around the kitchen table at night drinking from quart bottles of beer and laughing : memories of strange voices through closed doors and laughing and of streams of new uncles until that strange day of salvation . It was on a cold rainy day in December and I had myself a case of the sniffles , Jimbo 's mom would tell when remembering that distant afternoon of salvation at Ketchum 's Funeral Home . Her sister Garnet 's beauty parlor was contracted at that time by Ketchum 's to fix the final hairdos of corpses being prettied for viewing and Jimbo 's mom was there that afternoonalone working on old Miss Lawson 's hair . I remember Iwas thinking about your dad , Jimbo 's mom would tell , declaringshe could remember it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him in a couple of weeks and she knew from the papers that heavy fighting was going on in his theatre . She was worried that maybe he had n't received the nice Christmas presents she had mailed . She was feeling sort of tired and blue while she worked slowly on old Miss Lawson 's hair . I remember it perfectly , she would tell . I was just pinning a big curl by old Miss Lawson 's right ear and Bing Crosby was singing I 'm Dreaming of a White Christmas on the radio when suddenly she sat up . Old Miss Lawson just sat up as big as you please like she had totally forgotten she was dead . I mean I have heard of dead bodies floating up in water before but never in thin air . I must have hit my head on the table when I fainted for I went into sort of a coma or a trance or something and I did n't wake up until the next afternoon home safe in my own bed . But from the very moment she did wake up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had had a religious experience , a signal from God . God would n't just go around terrifying a body like that for no good reason . Jimbo 's mom just knew that God had picked her out special . She had been waiting her entire life to be picked out somehow , to be made special , and she had never lost faith in its eventuallyp53coming to pass . Now it had and she was saved by it . She was reborn . And do n't ask me how I knew , Jimbo 's mom would tell in her hushed , religious voice , but somehow deep in my heart I was sure that old Miss Lawson 's corpse sitting up the way it did was a special signal direct from God to me that the Allies were destined to win the Second World War and that your dad would come home safe and sound and a hero to boot . They went religiously then , Jimbo and his mom , every Saturday evening to the movies to witness the Second World War , the star of many films @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surely as a serial . Outplotted again and again by the cunning and courage of Hollywood , German generals , cast as cartoons , goose-stomped their monocles in rage . With whole rising-sun battalions being beaten by handfuls of Seabeeswith bulldozers , Japs jabbered more and more hystericallyand began dive-bombing their funny little yellow cartoon Zeros splat against the miraculous metal of American ships , vanishing to no avail . Old Miss Lawson 's rising corpse was but the first of many signals Jimbo 's mom was to discover and identify over the years , including the most recent , when one morning just six months earlier Jimbo had trotted down for breakfast to find her sitting quietly alone at the kitchen table , an ashtray of smoldering stubs before her , the radio softly humming gospel songs . I do n't think I 'll get around to cooking up breakfast this morning , she had said , her voice hushed , a strange tight smile on her lips , and her eyes wide and bright . Terrific , Jimbo said and trotted over to the refrigerator . She started humming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few moments said : You know , I had wonderful , wonderful dreams all night long that our Lord Jesus came back to earth and walked among us again making miracles right and left . Here we go , Jimbo thought , scanning the refrigerator shelves , amen city . Yes indeedy , Jimbo 's mom said , Jesus touched all the lame and the blind and all the sick and He cured them . There was no pain nor misery anymore . Nobody had to die anymore . And I justp54know deep in my heart it 's going to come to pass soon . Because I got me a signal , Jimbo 's mom said , turning her face toward him , its creamed skin glistening in the bright overhead light . You know , this morning when I took my bath I discovered a lump . Well , what about it , son ? Captain asks , and except for the low drone from the teevee in the living room , everything falls silent . Things just do n't vanish into thin air . You best come up with some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the thick fingers enfolding the water glass of scotch and milk . He remembers having heard somewhere that big fingers meant big dicks and for a moment , in spite of himself , he wonders . Jesus , but he is a big bastard , Jimbo thinks , sizing his old man up , as he does at least once every single day of his life . And goddamn if he is n't just like everyone says a deadringer for fucking John Wayne . Well , son , answers , Captain says in his firm but polite Captain of the Second World War interrogating a Nazi officer voice . I do n't have any answers , Jimbo says . Things just get lost sometimes . But they always turn up . Anyway , why do I always get blamed for things vanishing around here ? Jimbo 's mother 's fork , spearing minced waffle , clinks china . Pitched battle noises flare up from the teevee in the living room : shouts , exploding shells , machine gun fire , screams . From where Jimbo is sitting he can see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ low moon in the left bottom corner of the living room 's picture window , the battle raging across its ghostly surface . Captain carefully forks another waffle from the platter and butters it slowly , the movements of his huge hands precise . Jimbo is fascinated , as always , by the strange grace , the delicate touch , of Captain 's powerful , frightening hands . Jimbo thinks of Captain 's hobby , his miniaturearmies of tiny toy soldiers , with all the small features of the faces , all the details of the uniforms , so exact : all the brightp55colors so cleanly painted , so painstakingly perfect . Those huge hands , Jimbo thinks . Big dicks . Big dicks . The candlelight glistens like liquid on the butter knife , its motions , and on Captain 's wide gold wedding band . Small moons of candle flame are gathered in the thick centers of Captain 's glasses and Jimbo worries . He always worries when he ca n't see Captain 's eyes . Carefully Captain covers the waffle with syrup , the liquid spreading thickly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a perfect puddle . Captain is smiling faintly . He is smiling his tightly grim smile , the most dangerous of all . Jimbo 's stomach knots with fear . He has a sudden urge to swirl from the table and run . Run for his life . He remembers suddenly that long-ago day he failed at fishing . That fearful day he could not touch the silvery form flopping to death in the deep grass . You have to snap its neck , Captain had told him . So it wo n't suffer too much . So it wo n't have to drown in the air . Could not . Could not meet the eyes , the fish eyes , Captain 's . Captain had had nothing but contempt for him , had even hated him at that moment , Jimbo had more than suspected as he watched Captain pick up the still twitchingtrout and walk grimly toward him . It ca n't hurt you , Captain had said . It 's just a fish . Here , do it . Goddamn , I said do it ! Goddamn girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the back of his shirt . Captain cupped the back of Jimbo 's head and neck in one of his huge hands and with the other slowly rubbed the trout over Jimbo 's face , until at last the fish hung limp and dripping . Jimbo is being held up like a fish . His mouth feels torn . A thumb stuffs a gill . Fingers burn scales . Perhaps he is dreaming . Should he be frightened ? Actually , he is numb and more sees these things than feels them . No , he only sees them . He does not feel them at all . It is a dream . It is the old fish dream , a dream he has had often since that day he failed at fishing . The pressure is gentle , a gentle squeezing . asleep ? Hisp56right foot is being held , squeezed gently . Jimbo awakes slowly . His right foot is warm in a huge hand . Jimbo blinks his eyes in the darkness . The dark form sitting on the bed beside him is framed in the hall light coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whispers . Jimbo can smell whiskey . The warm hand holding his foot is damp . Soldierboy , you awake ? Yes , sir , Jimbo nods in the darkness . You want to camp out tonight , soldierboy ? the form whispers . Yes , yes , sir , Jimbo says and sits up . Jimbo rubs his eyes in the bright hall light as he follows the slightly weaving Captain toward the kitchen . Camping out ! Hot dog ! It had been a long time since Captain had asked him to camp out . Maybe everything was all right now . Maybe it did n't matter that he had failed again . Failed today at the Dreamland Swimming Pool . Failed this time at swimming . Maybe it was all right now . Captain had gotten him up , right ? And Captain had asked him to camp out again , right ? Maybe he would not have to go to summer camp after all . Maybe swimming would not matter now . Uncle Boomer is sitting at the kitchen table . His face is very pale in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his eyes and in the hollows of his cheeks . He is wearing his old , battered gray fedora tilted back on his head as always and as always a cigarette dangles from the corner of his mouth . With his fedora and his thin black mustache , Boomer looks , to Jimbo , like that teevee detective , Boston Mackie . Jimbo wishes he had a fedora and a thin black mustache . Jimbo wishes he was a teevee detective . He will be someday all right . Someday . Anyway , Boomer sure does n't look like an undertaker , which is what he is . Worm pies , Boomer always says , that 's my business . Worm pies . Hello , squirt , Boomer says to Jimbo in his deep , froggy voice , the source of his nickname . Jimbo grins at him . Uncle Boomer is his best buddy . Jimbo sits down at the kitchen table . Jimbo blinks , then rubs his eyes . Jimbo stares at the snow-piled tabletop . No , it 's not snow , Jimbo realizes , squinting his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , spotting the opened sugar canisterp57at the table 's edge . Sugar ? Two , maybe three pounds of sugar , white and sparkling in the bright light , spread out over the tabletop , shaped into little rolling hills with finger tracks traced like small roads through them . Damn , Captain says . Jimbo glances up at Captain 's looming , weaving form at the end of the table . I went to wake up my soldierboy and I clean forgot to relieve myself , Captain says . You forgot to go potty ? Boomer says and pours a water glass nearly full from a bottle in a paper bag . Yes . Yes , I did . I clean forgot to drain my hog , Captain says and walks unsteadily back toward the hallway . Boomer chuckles and takes a long drink from the water glass . Jimbo touches the nearest hill of sugar , then puts his finger in his mouth . How does it taste , squirt ? Boomer asks and winks one of his droopy-lidded , always sleepy-looking eyes . Sweet . Like sugar , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're kidding , squirt , Boomer says , taking another drink . It should taste like cheese . It should taste like the moon . That 's a lunar landscape you 're nibbling at , squirt . The man-in-the-moon 's cheeks . What 's that mean , squirt yourself ? Jimbo says , tracing a finger around the sugar 's edge . Does n't mean a thing , squirt , Boomer says and winks again . I do n't mean to confuse you . I 'm pulling your leg actually . Actually that 's the Second World War you 're tasting there , squirt . Actually that 's your basic Battle of the Bulge you 're calling sweet . What 's that mean ? You 're just talking silly . ' Cause you 're drunk . And Daddy 's drunk too . Why you 're not quite as dumb as everyone says you are , Boomer says and chuckles . Sometimes you 're the one that 's dumb , Jimbo says . Captain walks back into the kitchen and turning a chairp58around from the table straddles it . His thick glasses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plastered against his damp forehead . He rolls a toothpick about in his mouth and for a time just sits there staring at the sugar on the tabletop . Jimbo stares at the sugar also . The moon , Jimbo thinks . The man-in-the-moon . A sugar moon . A sugar manin-the-moon . Do I look like a worried man , Boomerboy ? Captain finally says , squinting his eyes at Boomer . Just because I piss bright red . Are you a worried man ? Boomer says , polishing off his drink and pouring another . Not me , Boomerboy . Just because I piss blood . Why would pissing blood bother an old warhorse like me , Boomerboy ? You 're right . It should n't . Just a goddamn leaking war wound probably . Right , Boomerboy . And by God , red 's a patriotic color . Red , white , and blue , Boomerboy . When I piss it 's like a goddamn salute . No , Boomer says . Sorry but you 're wrong there , Cap . Red 's a commie color . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says . Boomer flashes his small yellow teeth . Check , Captain says and holds up his glass . Check , Boomer says and clinks his glass against Captain 's and they both toss their drinks down . Boomer pours them both another drink and for a time they just sit there silently sipping and staring at the table . Captain , almost absently , begins smoothing the small hills of sugar and retracing the little roads , the sugar dimpling faintly in the wake of his moving finger . Jimbo intently watches the slow movement of Captain 's huge , hairy hands as they gently shape and reshape the sugar . A wooden kitchen match is stuck blue tip up like a small flagless pole near the sugar 's center , and it occurs to Jimbo , as he watches Captain 's hands , that Captain is shaping everything , all the little hills , the roads , around this match , that the match is the center of it all . It occurs to Jimbop59that the match is the Captain , and he has a sudden crazy picture of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helmet . Yes , sir , Captain says , they thought they were being smart when they split the goddamn column . Captain takes the toothpick from his mouth and flicks it toward the garbage pail under the sink . With his forefingers Captain carefully traces two lines that circle the bottom of a sugar hill toward the match . Suddenly he flicks little sprays of sugar like small explosions . They thought they were cute until we nailed their asses . Captain laughs and takes the match from the sugar and puts it between his teeth . Right , soldierboy ? Captain says and covers the top of Jimbo 's head with his huge hand like a helmet . They thought they were cute , did n't they ? Captain says and shakes Jimbo 's head . Hey , soldierboy , did you tell your old Uncle Boomerboy about summer camp ? Yes , siree ! Old soldierboy here 's heading for old Camp Six Nations a week from Saturday . Get him ready for old Greenbrier Military someday . Got your heart set on it , right , soldierboy ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Old soldierboy here 's been getting all set for old Camp Six Nations . We 've been getting ready for weeks . Getting in shape . Practicing everything . Got him batting and fielding like a Cincinnati Red . Like old Gus Bell or Ted the K. Even been going out to the driving range a few evenings a week . Listen , the kid just might make another Slammin ' Sammy someday . Had a little trouble with the swimming over at the Dreamland Pool today though . But we 'll get it licked . He 'll be swimming like a fish by the time he heads for camp . Right , soldierboy ? Yes , sir , Jimbo says . Swimming like a fish you say , Boomer says . Like a goddamn fish , Captain says . Right , soldierboy ? Yes , sir , Jimbo says . Yes , siree . Soldierboy , how 's about I go get things set up ? Captain says and polishes off his drink . He rises heavily to his feet . Boomer , you stick around , buddy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soldierboy 's cot ready . While I can still crawl , Captain says and laughs and walks unsteadily over to the basement door . He stomps heavily down the basement steps . Swim like a fish , eh ? Boomer says and chuckles . I 'll probably drown first , Jimbo says and flicks at the sugar with a finger . Then you 'll be one of my customers , squirt . A soaked squirt worm pie . Who cares ? Jimbo says . Is this a private party ? Jimbo 's mother says . She is standing in the hall doorway . Her blond hair is rolled up in curlers and her face is shiny with cold cream . No , come on in , my dear , Boomer says . You do n't need a ticket for this party . What the dickens are you doing up , little man ? she asks Jimbo . As she walks toward the table she clutches the top of her blue quilted robe together tightly with both hands . Do you have any blessed idea what time of night it is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and flicks at the sugar . We 're going to camp out together . He 's down in the shelter fixing my cot . Oh , that 's peachy . Oh my word , what in heaven 's name is this mess ? she says and bends over the table squinting her eyes at the sugar . That mess is your basic Second World War , Boomer says . You remember . Boom boom . Bang bang . Do n't you recognize a basic Battle of the Bulge mess when you see one , my dear ? I do n't believe it . I just do n't believe it , she says , shaking her head slowly . The sad , tired look comes over her face , the lines around her mouth deepen , and her eyes get wide and watery . Well , this is just peachy , she says . Well , just how far gone is our Captain tonight ? No more than half , Boomer says . About like me . Thanks for getting him home anyway . A pleasure , my dear . Jimbo 's mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begins to scrape the sugar into it . Boomer stands up and helps her . Jimbo scoots his chair away from the table and just watches as the little sugar hills and roads disappear . He feels vaguely sad . Well , so how have you been , Bob ? It 's been a spell since you 've been around here , Jimbo 's mother says . Ca n't complain . Business is brisk , Boomer says . He carefully scrapes the last of the sugar off the table into the canister which Jimbo 's mother now holds with both hands . Worm pies forever , he says and sits back down . How 's it been with you , June ? I stay busy with my church work , she says . She puts the canister on a shelf over the sink , then returns to the table with a washrag and begins to slowly wipe the grainy surface . Still Jesus , eh ? Boomer says and raises his glass toward her . Well , here 's to you two . You never did understand , she says . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boomer . You never really tried , did you , Bob ? Wrong , Boomer says and drains his glass . You 're the party who never tried . When Captain calls for himJimbo jumps up from the table . His mother glares at him and he looks away . He walks eyes downcast slowly over to the basement door . He noisily hops down the basement stairs two at a time . Such a nice full basement , warm enough in winter , cool enough in summer . But no shelves of jellies and jams , no rows and rows of mason jars of green beans will you find in this basement ; and no boxes or barrels or trunks or old furniture will you find stored along its walls or stacked in its corners . There is room only for Captain 's battle tables , tables Captain has built all around the walls of the basement and then in exact , miniature detail has lovingly landscaped with chicken wire , with papier mache , with earth and stone , the terrains of famous battlefields . There is a Battle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table , and along with three otherp62Second World War tables , a large Battle of the Bulge table . This is Captain 's hobby . Night after night , scotch and milk in hand , Captain descendsinto his basement to drink alone and play war games on his battle tables with his tiny toy soldiers for hours , hours : recharging the great charges , reretreating the great tactical retreats ; companies , legions , whole armies of tiny toy soldiers Captain cast himself , then painstakingly painted and each night breathed battlelife into , whole armies of tiny toy soldiers rising and falling and rising once again , all by Captain 's command . He could save Napoleon at Waterloo with an unexpecteddaring charge of confederate cavalry . He could crush the Normans at Hastings with a surprise Roman ghost legion and pluck that fateful arrow from Harold 's eye just as he pleased . Then there was the one toy soldier Captain had made special , had cast him larger than the others and had fashioned him in an elaborate , princely uniform of his own design . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always led the victors to their glory , no matter what battle of what armies of what age . For years , night after night , for hours sometimes , hidden in the dark beneath the basement steps , Jimbo would watch Captain 's intense face as he fought . I 'll turn the teevee on , soldierboy , Captain says . You can watch the late show until I get back , how 's that ? Why do n't you stay now ? Jimbo asks . He sits cross-legged on the army cot Captain has spread over with a sleeping bag . Well , fellow , I 'll be right back . I just want to say goodnight to old Uncle Boomer is all . I 'll come directly back . Listen , there 's a good late show on I bet . I want you to stay down here . It 's no fun being down here by myself . Why , you 're not afraid , are you ? A tough old soldierboy like you ? Afraid of the buggerman ? I 'll leave the lights on . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you to stay here , that 's all . Why ca n't you stay here anyway ?  |p63Now  do n't you start any of that damn whining . Yes , sir . Oh hell , soldierboy . Listen , I 'll open you a Coke . How 's that ? Only do n't tell your mom , all right ? Mom 's up . She is ? She 's up with Uncle Boomer in the kitchen . She is . She and Uncle Boomer cleaned your sugar off the table . Well , listen , soldierboy , I 'll be right back . Can we use the ham radio tonight ? Sure . Damn right . We 'll call all over the goddamn place . We 'll call Cincinnati . We 'll call Hollywood , California . Hell , we 'll call the goddamn moon ! Will you tell me some monster stories like you used to when we camped out when I was a little kid ? Damn right , Captain says . He gets a Coke out of the refrigeratorwhich he opens and gives to Jimbo . I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll tell you about the time old Count Dracula and the Wolfman teamed up to fight Frankenstein to the death in this spooky old castle . And some spook stories ?

Hey , soldierboy , just who the hell do you think fought off the moon spooks ? The good old U.S.A. Army , that 's who . Do I have to go swimming anymore , Dad ? Captain walks over and clicks on the teevee . He stands there beside it until its screen lights up , then he adjusts the picture until it is steady and clear . How 's that picture ? Captain asks . It 's all right . Looks like a cowboy movie . Yeah.  |p64I  'm sorry , soldierboy . Captain has to duck slightly as he passes through the shelter'slow door into the basement . Jimbo listens to Captain walk across the basement , then stomp up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shit , shit , fart , puke , damn , hell , fuck . Fuck . Double fuck . Double shit fart fuck . I wo n't go to sleep , Jimbo thinks . He shakes his head to clear it . I wo n't go to sleep before he comes back no matter what . Jimbo looks around the room . He has n't been down here for a long time . This was Captain 's room and you did not come down here unless he asked you . Captain had spent almost a year digging the room off the basement , then cinder-blocking its sides and finishing it up inside with knotty-pine walls . There was a small refrigerator in one corner and a teevee set in another . There were floor-to-ceiling shelves along one wall which were stacked high with cans and jars of food and with rows of gallon jugs of spring water . On a long table along another wall Captain had set up his ham radio outfit and on wooden racks above the table were his four favorite rifles and two shotguns . On another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state all stuck with small red pins showing the area civil defense locations . On another wall were framed photos of General Patton and General MacArthur and of President Ike . This was the only bomb shelter in the whole county . Those commies wo n't catch me with my Pearl Harbor hog hanging out , Captain would say when he was showing someone around the basement and shelter . Captain was fully prepared for World War Three and for a long time he had been sleeping nightly down in the shelter on a rollaway bed . Jimbo hears loud voices from the kitchen , his mother 's voice , Captain 's voice . This means Uncle Boomer has left . This means Captain wo n't be back down for a while . Jimbo hears shouts from the kitchen . Shit , he thinks . This means Captain might not be back down until morning . Or tomorrow night . Or next week . Shit , Jimbo thinks . Shit fart fuck . Well , I won'tgo to sleep , Jimbo thinks . I do n't care how long it takes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Easter . Jimbo opens his eyes wide and stares intently at the teevee . The shouting from the kitchen suddenly stops . Jimbo tiptoes from the shelter across the basement to the bottom of the stairs . The kitchen door is shut . Jimbo can hear his mom crying . She cries for a long time and no one says anything . Suddenly she shouts something and Captain shouts back . They start shouting and shouting again and someone smashes something glass . Jimbo runs back to the shelter . He slams its door and locks it from the inside , something he has been ordered never , never to do . Let him whip me , Jimbo says out loud . Who cares ? Who cares ? No , he ca n't whip me anyway , Jimbo thinks . Even if he wants to he ca n't . He ca n't get in . The shelter door was closed and locked and Jimbo would never open it again . Never . Never . They could beg him but he would n't open it . Please , please , they could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call back . Even if World War Three started up and commies were dropping bombs all over town . Even if moon spooks invaded town . Jimbo still would n't let them in . It was his room now . There were Cokes in the refrigerator . He had a teevee set . He could camp out in the shelter forever . And he would n't have to go to summer camp . And he would n't have to worry about the deep end ever again . The shouting from the kitchen gets louder and louder . Even through the closed shelter door . Jimbo puts his hands over his ears . He shakes his head . Nothing helps . He pulls the cot over directly in front of the teevee set and turns its sound up full blast . He takes the four remaining Cokes from the refrigerator and opens them , then sets them in a line on top of the teevee . He checks to make certain the shelter door is really locked , then sits on the cot with his face only inches from the blaring teevee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see . He can feel the teevee 's heat on his face . There is a faint crackling on his flesh . He squints his eyes until they water , until the cowboy forms fade , dissolve , become shadowy fish shapes his skin can feel . Captain took him for the first time to discover teevee . A night long ago . A hundred years ago . Jimbo shakes his head.  |p66He  does n't want to remember things outside the shelter . He does n't want to remember Captain at all . He wants to dissolve in the teevee 's light , to be a shadowy fish form in teevee 's deep end . Let 's head for the deep end , Captain had said . You can swim like a fish , soldierboy , Captain had said . Just jump in and swim to me , son . I 'm right here , soldierboy . Jimbo curled his toes over the pool 's edge . The deep end . He could smell chlorine . The choppy , faintly green water shivered with light . Squeals of laughter , screams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the air . Jimbo shivered . He wanted more than anything to be with Captain in the deep end . Come on now , Jimbo , Captain called . I 'm right here . You 're not going to drown , damn it ! Jimbo gazed at the blue , onionshapeddomes of the dressing rooms at the far end of the long pool . He wished with all of his heart that the day was over and that he was in that dressing room right now . Jimbo knew he would not drown . He knew that . He knew that . Damn it , jump ! Jump ! Captain shouted and slapped the water with a cupped hand . It sounded like a shot . Jimbo flinched . He stared at his toes , at the deep end only inches beyond them . He felt dizzy . Jump , damn it ! Slap . Jump ! Slap . Why do n't you go on and jump , chicken ? someone from behind Jimbo said and laughed . You ai n't gon na drown , chicken . Others laughed . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Laughter . Jump ! Slap . Jump ! Slap . Jump , jump , jump , they began to chant along with Captain . It was not really much of a shove . More a touch , a mere pressure of fingers from someone behind him . The deep end 's water strangled into Jimbo 's throat . He chopped desperately to the deep end 's surface . He chopped choking , half blind , towardCaptain . That 's it ! That 's it ! Captain called as he paddled backward in the deep end away from Jimbo . From where Jimbo is sitting he can see the image of thep67teevee screen reflected like some strange low moon in the left bottom corner of the living room 's picture window . Well , answer me , son , Captain says . Where is your movie projector ? Where are the radios and that telescope you built ? Things do n't just vanish into thin air . They 're all my things , Jimbo says , sliding bits of waffle about on his plate , wishing those moons of candle flame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , wishing that tight , dangerous smile was not on Captain 's lips . They 're my personal business . She has no right nosing around in my room . I beg to differ , Jimbo 's mother says , tapping her lips lightly with a napkin . I have every right . I am your mother , after all . And I worry about you day and night . Here I am sick and all and I have to worry and worry about you . Honey , I do n't like those crazy books you read . I 've told you and told you . And then I find all those dirty poems you wrote about that little Catholic girl . And now all your nice toys have up and disappeared . I just worry myself sick . And I am already sick enough . Bullshit ! Jimbo yells . Stay the fuck out of my room ! For a backhand it is a good blow , quick , solid , and Captain 's middle knuckle catches Jimbo high on his forehead cleanly . Jimbo falls over backward in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A series of freezeframes . A slow-motion cartoon backward fall . In less than two seconds the back of Jimbo 's head will strike the baseboard and he will be knocked cold for nearly five minutes . It is in that slow-motion moment before Jimbo 's head strikes the baseboard knocking him silly that he plans fully the last job he will need to pull to purchase the only ring in the whole wide world . Yes , Jimbo gets the bright idea to steal the Second World War and to sell it off soldier by goddamn soldier.  |p68Sandy  Dee and Troy Donahue are french kissing behind a large rock on a secluded beach when several guys come trotting past and slow up to make wisecracks about Troy getting some . Troy jumps up and chases after them but they run , laughing , on down the beach . When Troy returns and flops back down beside her Sandy sees he is embarrassed . She takes his hand . After a few moments of silence Sandy shyly asks Troy if he has ever been bad with a girl . No , Troy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calls him with the bad news Troy runs away from prep school and hitchhikes to her side . They will need money , lots of it . Sandy gives Troy her mink coat , a Christmas present from her father , to hock , and with the money Troy buys an old Plymouth for their getaway . It is their first home , they joke . They will make the perfect getaway in it all right . No one will ever find them . They have their truelove , and they will have their baby , and they will be happy forever and ever . But things just do not work out for them that way . They find themselves hiding out under bridges as copcars wail through the dangerous adult night . They decide to face the music . They will confess to their parents . Troy 's father is a sad old drunk who blew his inheritance . Sandy 's mother is a bitch obsessed with the evil of sex . Troy 's mother is married currentlyto Sandy 's father . Hand in hand the stepbrother and stepsister confront @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understanding and forgiveness . People in glass houses should n't throw stones , Sandy 's father , Troy 's stepfather , starring Richard Egan , says and they all embrace . Sandy and Troy will live on the beautiful island in the lovely old rambling Victorian mansion among the pines . In the fadeout they stand arm in arm on a cliff above the blue summer sea . The music is by Percy Faith . There are a lot of strings . Theme from a Summer Place will remain high on the charts for over a year and thereafter it will remain a favorite oldie-but-goodie . As they walked up the crowded aisle out of the theatre Judy pressed tightly against Jimbo and squeezed his hand . Jimbo looked down at her and he saw she was smiling at him and that her eyes were bright and glistening . Perfect , Jimbo thought as he kissed her forehead . The movie had been perfect , perfect . For Judy to see this movie right now was perfect timing . The young and in truelove teenagers who ca n't help but go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ works out wonderfully for them in the end . Jimbo could n't have asked for anything more perfect . He kissed Judy 's forehead again , then whispered to her that the movie was just like them . It was their own special movie . When they reached the lobby they found Penny and Pace waiting for them by the water fountain . Judy and Penny immediately pranced off to the little girls ' room whispering excitedly . Jimbo and Pace fired up Camels and slouched against the wall . Although Pace had a face shaped like a wolf , thick lips , kinky blond hair , and about the worst case of acne in the whole highschool , he was the first of Jimbo 's crowd to get pussy . Indeed , he and Penny had been going all the way for over a year and because they both enjoyed talking about it everyone in town but their parents knew . Because Penny had perhaps the second worst case of acne in the whole highschool , she and Pace were even more certain than Jimbo and Judy that their love would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's shaking , man ? Pace said , nodding his head and looking sheepishly at Jimbo.  |p70Not  much , Jimbo said , wrinkling his forehead and arching his eyebrows . You still cut off , man ? Pace asked and frenchinhaled deeply . Yeah , Jimbo said . I 'm still cut off cold . Got the blue balls . Tough titty , Pace said . Tough titty . Right , Jimbo said . Well , this might help you remember how sweet it was , Pace said and waved his right hand 's middle finger under Jimbo 's nose . Thanks a lot , man , Jimbo said . You want me to cream in my jeans or something ? Not bad , is it ? Pace said and sniffed the finger himself . Yes , sir , that was a good year . What 's this test shit about ? Jimbo asked . Judy said Penny 's married cousin told Penny about it . The old puffed pussy test , Pace said . It 's a bunch of crap , man . Penny 's cousin is a real turdhead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ai n't about to knock old Penny up . I always pull the hog out , man . Always . Willpower , daddy . Willpower . The only thing I 'm going to ever knock up is old Penny 's belly button , man . But every goddamn month old Penny gets the sweats . I figured it was a bunch of crap , Jimbo said . Right , man . It does n't prove nothing , man . Except maybe that Penny 's got a nice wet pussy . Fuck , man , if I ever felt anything hard in Penny 's box I 'd figure some cat lost his watch up there or some shit . What would you do if you ever did knock Penny up ? Never happen , man . Like I said I pull the hog out . An accident . What would you do ? Operation Summerplace , man . What 's that ? Like the movie tonight . You know something , old Penny has seen this goddamn movie eight times . Eight goddamn times ! Well , like the movie , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excited . We 'd let everyone get used to the idea . Then we 'd come back and get forgiven . Penny 's old man would put mep71through law school . We 'd live happy ever after . Operation Summerplace , man . So you 'd do it ? You 'd marry her and everything ? Sure , man . Hey , I love old Penny . Like with all of my heart , man . We 'd be happy . We got a lot in common . And I mean a lot more than just liking to screw and our pimples . Dig it ? Well , what about you , daddy ? What happens if sweet Judy is knocked up ? Besides Frankie putting you in the hospital . Frankie ai n't putting me in any hospital , man , Jimbo said and arching his eyebrows dropped his Camel 's butt on the lobby 's carpet where he ground it in slowly . Well , what would you do ? Seriously ? Who knows ? Jimbo said and shrugged . Probably the same thing you 'd do . Your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it had been falling apart for years , its narrow , chuckhole-pocked pavement twisting up through the wooded hills south of town seeming to go nowhere at all , just circling through the hills turning back and back on itself . According to the local legend , the road had been started many years before by work gangs of prisoners from the state penitentiary . Later on in the 1930s it had been worked on by federal WPA laborers . Why it was started in the first place and just where it was supposed to go , no one seemed really to remember for sure , at least no one Jimbo ever talked to about it . For many years this road had been the town 's main lovers ' lane , where several generations of highschoolkids had gone up to knead their love in parked cars at night . It was also the place where the even younger kids of the town went to learn their own early lessons about love : went to hide behind trees and bushes beside the road , hoping to catch a glimpse of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place where during the past spring and early summer someone else had taken up hiding behind trees and bushes beside the road . Someone who had been only glimpsed but who looked like your basic dirty old man , everyone who had spotted him agreed ; whose leering phantom face wouldp72appear suddenly at a car window , then vanish just as quickly into the darkness ; a phantom face no one could recognize , for through the fogged windows it was like a mask . The Peeker , everyone called him . The crazy , perverted Snake Road Peeker creep . Jimbo pulled the goddamn BozoBoat into his and Judy 's special parking spot and stopped . He switched the key in the ignition onto auxiliary so they could leave the radio playing . At least the goddamn BozoBoat had a goddamn radio . The BozoBoat : that described it perfectly all right . An old , fireenginered Plymouth station wagon with Paramount CollectionAgency painted in large silver letters on its doors : and instead of a regular horn , a regular beep-beep white man 's horn , it had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a horn as loud as a siren which Captain would turn on and leave blaring when he pulled up in front of a deadbeat 's house to make a collection . You ought to see the neighbors hit the windows , Captain would tell , laughing , when I pull up and blast that goddamn horn . I know how to nail a deadbeat all right . Shame ' em . Shame ' em in front of their neighbors . Jesus , Jimbo thought . He seldom drove the BozoBoat anywhere , much less on a date with Judy . Not that Captain ever offered it anyway . But who the fuck care  --  imbo seldom even got near the goddamn BozoBoat if he could help it , except sometimes when he came rolling home late at night and figured it was time for a BozoBoat bath : late at night , in the dark , after holding it sometimes for hours , saving up until he thought he would pop , he would piss all over the goddamn BozoBoat . Tonight , the night of the big test of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her family 's cars and since Captain was away Jimbo had hotwired the BozoBoat . Slumped as low in the seat as he could get , Jimbo had driven back streets to pick Judy up and after the show he had refused to take her to the Beacon Drive-In . They had come directly parking and Judy was pouting about it but shit man no way was he going top73cruise the BozoBoat around the Beacon . Besides , Captain might get wind of it . But fuck , who cares ? Old Captain . Pecker tracks , Jimbo thought . Now if only he could leave pecker tracks all over the goddamn seats . Old Captain would shit a brick . Old Captain was going to shit a brick anyway . Old Captain was on the first vacation he had taken in ten years , a t wo-week fishing trip with a couple of old army buddies , and man , did he have a surprise or two waiting for him at home . Things had sure been easier with Captain gone all right . Stealing the Second World War @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been one hell of a job . Do you think we ought to roll up the windows and lock the doors ? Judy asked . She had her shoes off and she was sitting with her legs tucked up in the seat under her . Her cotton dress was pulled high on her thighs and Jimbo could see the dark lower edge of her hose . She had not let him touch her since she missed her period a month ago . Not even her breasts . They had not even frenchkissed . Afraid of the Peeker ? Jimbo said . He fired up a Camel and frenchinhaled deeply . I 'm just nervous . Do n't you think I can take care of you ? Where 's all that old-time confidence in the kid ? Do n't make a federal case out of it . Sorry , Jimbo said . He rolled up his window and locked the door . I 'm not really afraid , Judy said , smiling shyly . The edges of her teeth were very white in her tanned face . Not when I 'm with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For a time they sat silently listening to the radio and looking out at the view from their special parking place of the town 's lights and of the lighted bridge over the dark river to Ohio . The red lights of a radio tower on the next hilltop blinked in lazy sequence . Lightning bugs blinked like small hot eyes from the dark . Judy 's perfume filled the car.  |p74Well  , honey , Jimbo said , what about this test business ? Judy folded her hands in her lap and gazed down at them . Well , she said , using her cute inhaling husky voice , it 's soembarrassing . Honey , what could possibly be embarrassing between us ? We 're too close for that . We 've been as close as two people can be . Like , our love has made us close . Well , Penny 's married cousin told her about it . You have todo it with me . The test that is . Oh , this is so embarrassing ! Judy put her hands over her eyes and shook her head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't help it if I 'm embarrassed , Judy said , a slight break in her voice . I 'm so sorry . I 'm sorry I 'm the way I am but I just ca n't help it . Hey , sweetheart , Jimbo said . He took Judy 's hand and kissed it . I understand . Really . It 's not your fault . You just take your time , honey , and tell me about this test the best way you can . Just do it your own way , honey . Judy smiled and kissed Jimbo 's hand . He could feel her tongue between her lips on his skin . Her eyes were shining with tears . Well , she began with a sigh , one part of the test is to feel my breasts and see if they seem to be getting larger . I tried but I ca n't really tell if they are or not . Getting larger I mean . Judy put Jimbo 's hand to her lips again and for a few moments was silent . Well , honey , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I mean , what 's it supposed to show and all ? Well , Judy said with another small sigh , according to Penny'smarried cousin the other part is to touch me . Down there . To see if that little thing is hard or not . That 's it . That 's the whole test . I still do n't get it , Jimbo said . He turned down the radio . I mean , exactly what 's the test supposed to prove ? According to Penny 's married cousin , if my breasts seem to be getting larger and if the little thing is hard too , thenp75probably I 'm going to have a baby . I do n't know if it 's true or not but that 's what Penny 's married cousin told her . Oh , yeah . Right , Jimbo said . I 've heard about that test before . I read about it somewhere I think . Did you really ? Yeah , I 'm sure I did . Like , in the Reader 's Digest I think . Well , maybe we can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for sure . Right . At least it 's worth a try . Yes , 1 guess it is . Right . We 'd better be finding out for sure as soon as possible . So we can make plans and everything if we have to . Yes , I just have to know . I 've been sick all month from worrying . This is the first time in my whole life I 've been so late . I 've prayed for I do n't know how many hours . I just hope God forgives me and I 'm not pregnant . I even thought about telling it in confession . For Christ 's sake , do n't do that ! I mean , honey , a priest would run right to your parents . I mean , he 'd make you tell them . And , like , that would sure be the end of us . I 'm just so worried and confused about everything . Look , honey , do n't sweat it . I 'll take care of everything . Things will work out . Jimbo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kissed her wrist . Penny says she does n't care if she is pregnant , Judy said . She says she loves Pace and that they can work something out no matter what just as long as they 're together . That 's the way I feel about us , Jimbo said . He kissed the inside of Judy 's elbow and then her shoulder . Penny says that they 'll run away if they have to . They 've even been making plans and things in case . They 're going to leave clues that they ran off to Florida but really they 're going to run off to California . There are lots of jobs in California . Pace has even been getting California papers and checking the want ads.  |p76If  you 're pregnant would you want to run off with me to California ? Do you still love me enough ? Of course I love you , silly . I love you more than anything in the whole wide world . Jimbo kissed Judy 's neck . Well , honey , you sure have n't shown it much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since you proved how much you love me . Please ! Judy said , pushing away from him . Please ! Please do n't start that . Not now . Please . Start what ? What the hell have I done wrong now ? Oh , you know what I mean all right . Do n't play dumb . I ca n't help the way I feel . Why make it harder for me ? I feel so guilty about everything . About my family and my faith . And all you do is make it harder for me . Look , I know , honey , Jimbo said . He hugged Judy to him and kissed her hair . I feel the same way a lot of the time myself . I mean , you 're not the only one who has let God down . But like , we talked about all of that before we ever went all the way in the first place . Like , God is n't going to leap on someone'schest for being in love . God understands if anyone does . He 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God is supposed to be love itself and everything , honey . Sweetheart , like , we love each other and that 's all that matters . A stupid piece of paper is n't going to make our love any more real or deep than it is right now . I 'm sorry , Jim , but I ca n't think of it as a stupid piece of paper . You 're right . You 're right , honey . It 's not stupid . I did n't mean exactly that . It 's right to be married in the eyes of the church and all . I know that . Like , it 's being respectful to God for what He has given us . It 's like a covenant with Him . You know what I mean . All I 'm saying is that God is n't going to come down on us for being young and in love . Especially since we 're going to get married for sure and everything . Do you really think God understands ? Sure He does . Like , God is no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I love you , honey . And if you are going to have our child then we 'll work something out . We 'll go to California like Pace a n d Penny . I know everyone will be upset and everything but alter we get married and settled somewhere and have the baby , then they 'll come around . Just like in the movie tonight . They were young and in love and they made mistakes just like us . But everything worked out for them in the end . And it will for us , sweetheart . I promise . I really do love you , Jim . I want to spend the rest of my life making you happy . And I want to make you happy , babe . And I could make you happy right now if only you 'd let me . We could really make each other happy . If you 'd let things be like they were . Oh for God 's sake ! Judy cried . You just wo n't quit ! You just wo n't ! Jimbo flopped back in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Judy covered her face with her hands and began to cry . Fuck this bullshit , Jimbo thought and turned up the radio . He was a goddamn human being , was n't he ? How was he supposed to handle this sort of bullshit ? I need some air , Jimbo said and got out of the car . He slammed the door . He suddenly thought of the Peeker creep who was supposed to be prowling around Snake Road spying on parked cars . He shivered and looked over his shoulder . Well , at least someone is getting his jollies , Jimbo thought and spit out into the darkness . But not if he was spying on the old BozoBoat . If the Peeker creep was spying on the old BozoBoat he was wasting his time . That was a goddamn fact of life . Jimbo walked around to the front of the BozoBoat and sat up on the hood . By the dashboard light he could see Judy was still crying . Fuck it . He flicked his half-smoked Camel out into the dark , then immediately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cars coming across the bridge from Ohio . A warm breeze stirred the fat summer leaves on the trees around the small clearing and he shivered again . Fuck it , he thought and lay back on the still warm hood and slowly blew a series of smoke rings into the night air . The sky , cloudyp78earlier in the evening , had begun to clear , and as the dark clouds shifted Jimbo could see several pale stars and the bright , full moon . Wolfman moon , Jimbo thought and shiveredagain . Jesus Christ , what 's wrong with me ? Old Captain Nerves of Steel with a case of the shivers . Jimbo laughed quietly . He looked over at the radio tower on the next hilltop and began blinking his eyes in sequence with its flashing lights . Jimbo slid off the hood and walked around to the back of the BozoBoat and pissed along its bumper . When he finished he ducked low and sneaked around the car . Judy had her head resting back on the seat , her face turned away from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , smudginghis features on the glass . He twisted his mouth into a wide leering grin , then gently tapped on the window . Peek peek peek , he called when Judy turned to look . Judy screamed and ducked down in the seat . Honey ! Honey ! Jimbo called , trying to open her door . I 'm sorry ! Honey , I 'm sorry ! Jimbo ran around the car to his door . Baby , I 'm sorry ! I was just playing a dumb joke , he said and pulled Judy to him . She shivered and pressed her face into his neck . Hey , honey , come on now . Hey , there , sweetie . Settle down . Settle down now . I 'm sorry . Really , baby . I was being dumb . Jesus , I 'm sorry . You scared me silly , Judy said . I did n't know who you were . Hey , there , Jimbo said . He lifted Judy 's chin . Hey , there . Forgive me ? Please ? Pretty please ? You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cute husky inhaling voice . I can be a bad boy , I know it well , Jimbo said and kissed her eyes . Hey , honey , listen there ! Jimbo turned up the radio . Listen to those sounds . Theme from a Summer Place . Our song coming right over the radio just like the doctor ordered . Our song . Judy kissed Jimbo 's hand . Her eyes were bright . May I have this here dance , ma'am ? Jimbo said in his John Wayne voice . He opened his cardoor.  |p79Oh  , silly . No , ma'am , I reckon I insist . I reckon this here is our dance , ma'am , Jimbo said and clicked on the headlights . Come on now , ma'am , do n't tarry . Let us shake a foot while the band is cooking . Silly , I 'm barefoot , Judy said and pulled back . I 'll ruin my new hose . You are such a nut .

Jimbo led Judy around to the front of the BozoBoat and they began to slowdance in the headlights . Jimbo clasped his hands in the small ofJudy 's back just above the swell of her hips and Judy clasped her hands behindJimbo 's neck and began playing gently with his hair . Jimbo pressed his face into Judy 's freshly washed fragrant hair . Jimbo could feel Judy 's breasts and thighs as she pressed tightly against him and they swayed slowly together to the song , their song , their summerplace song , on the car radio , their feet nearly motionless in the deep grass . In the headlights they were a moviecouple , incandescentand romantic perfectly . And somewhere beyond the edges of the shimmering light , somewhere out in the darkness where lightning bugs blinked like tiny flashbulbs , an ice cupid melted slowly bluegreen . Jimbo shut his eyes .

Yes , sir , Bebop Billy had said , our little Judy is Sweet Sixteen today . And Jimbo here has a very , very special surprise for you , sweetheart . Right , Jimbo ? And he wants to give it to you right here live on camera so you two lovebirds can share this happy moment with everyone out there in teeveeland . Right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face collapsing into smiles , and he took the only ring in the whole wide world from his sportcoat 's side pocket and taking Judy 's left hand slid it quickly onto her ring finger . Judy 's blue eyes popped wide and her mouth popped open . She held her hand up , letting the only ring in the whole wide world glitter in the bright studio lights . Judy squealed and covered her face with her hands and jumped up and down . Suddenly she threw her arms around Jimbo 's neck , knocking him off balance , and they staggered backward across the slick dance floor until Jimbo regained his footing . He frantically arched his eyebrows and wrinkled his forehead . Judy covered his face with kisses . Everyone laughed and applauded . Hey , gang , Bebop Billy said , let 's dedicate this next slow number to the lovebirds and let them have the floor to themselves , OK ? The studio lights dimmed and the platter Sixteen Candles began playing . Jimbo pressed his face into Judy 's hair , his breath thick with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Judy 's essence . Soft blond down on her arms . Her skin . Her blond smell . Her blond ponytail , which bounced relentlessly when they bopped . Because Jimbo was tall Judy danced on tiptoe . See Judy press against Jimbo . See Judy play with Jimbo 's hair . Everyone witnessing Jimbo and Judy 's slowdance smiled . Thunder sounded far off in the hills across the river and a warm breeze stirred the fat summer leaves on the trees around the small clearing . Jimbo opened his eyes . The song , their special summerplace song , was ending . Ugh ! Judy cried , jumping back away from Jimbo . What ? Jimbo cried . What 's wrong ? What 'd I do ? Ugh ! Ugh ! Judy cried , pointing at the grass and hopping upand down.  |p81What  ? What ? I stepped on something ! Something slimy ! A snake ! I think it was a slimy snake ! Snake ! Jimbo cried and hopped backward himself . Snake ? What goddamn snake ? Ugh ugh ugh ! Judy cried . She ran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are n't slimy , Judy . Squinting his eyes in the bright headlights , Jimbo bent over to peer into the deep grass . When Judy hit the BozoBoat 's siren Jimbo jumped straight up in the air , then stumbled backward falling into the grass . He scrambled to his feet and ran to the BozoBoat . What the hell do you think you 're doin  --  imbo yelled as he jumped into the frontseat . Judy had both hands clasped over her mouth and was laughing too hard to speak . That 's really funny as shit , Jimbo said , arching his eyebrows and firing up a Camel . Really goddamn funny , Judy . It was , Judy said , gasping . The way you jumped up and fell down . You jumped so high . You looked like a frog or something . Judy clasped her hands over her mouth again and started laughing . Oh yeah , Judy . Really goddamn funny . A million goddamn laughs . You 're a real card , Judy . Real cute , Judy . Jimbo said and frenchinhaled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you scared me first . What 's the matter anyway ? Afraid of a little biddy snake or something ? Me ? Me ? Me afraid of snakes ? Are you kidding , girl ? Are you crazy ? Of course I 'm afraid of snakes , lamebrain . I 'm scared shitless of them , the horrible creatures , Jimbo said and grinned . Did I really jump like a frog ? Just exactly like a frog , Judy said , laughing . Old Captain Rebel Without a Cause hopping like a frog , Jimbo said , grinning , and slowly shook his head . Well , hey , little Miss Wiseass , did you really step on something in the grass ? Yes , now I really and truly did step on something ugh ugh ,  |p82Judy  said in her cute inhaling husky voice . I cross my heart and hope to die I really and truly did step on something . Probably just a used rubber , Jimbo said . What ? A what ? Nothing , Jimbo said . Nothing . Whatever it was I scared it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with old Captain Badass . It crawled off in the grass to save its ass . My hero , Judy said . Damn right , Jimbo said and in several poses flexed his muscles . Judy chuckled and taking Jimbo 's hand kissed it . To Know Him Is to Love Him began playing on the radio and Judy turned it up . Judy ran her tongue slowly over Jimbo 's knuckles . When the record was over Jimbo quietly said : Well , honey , what should we do ? About the test I mean . I want to do the test , Judy said , almost whispering . I just have to know for sure . Right , honey , Jimbo said . We should find out . So we can make plans and all if we have to . For a few moments Judy just sat there looking down at her hands in her lap . Slowly Judy began to unbutton the front of her dress . In the dashboard 's faint light the down of her bare tanned arms glowed golden . The only ring in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pearls glowed on Judy 's engagement finger . Operation Summerplace , Jimbo thought . If Judy is knocked up then it 's Operation Summerplace . And they would find their summerplace too , by God . Jimbo scooted over beside Judy and casually slid his arm around the back of her seat . Judy sat there looking down at her hands in her lap , the front of her dress open . Jimbo put his arm around her shoulders and gently drew her to him and kissed her forehead . Whatever happens , honey , Jimbo said , remember I love you . And I 'll always take care of you . Always . We 'll be together no matter what . And as long as we 're together nothing can hurt us . I love you so much . I love you too , Jim , Judy said and smiled shyly.  |p83The  moment Jimbo 's fingertips touched the smooth skin ofher stomach Judy shivered . Jimbo jerked his hand away . Did I hurt you , honey ? Did I scratch you or something ? No , Judy said quietly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jimbo lifted Judy 's bra and gently took her small right breast in his hand . In the evening airJudy 's breast felt cool at first but warmed quickly as Jimbo caressed it . Besides her delicate perfume a faint scent of sweet soap lifted from Judy 's skin . After a time Jimbo took her left breast in his hand . Judy closed her eyes and leaned her head back on the seat . Can you tell yet ? Judy said , in her cute inhaling husky voice . Are they getting larger ? I ca n't tell yet , Jimbo said and moved his hand back to her right breast . Her nipples had stiffened under his fingers . Jimbo kissed her ear . Can you tell anything at all yet ? Judy asked . She opened her eyes . Not yet , Jimbo said . Well , it should n't be all that hard to tell , Judy said . Her voice quivered . She placed a hand over the back of Jimbo 's hand and held it in place . Well , honey , Jimbo said and removed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think they are getting larger . Now I could be wrong but I really think they are . Oh no , Judy whispered . She slowly pulled her bra down and straightened it . She started to rebutton the front of her dress but stopped and just sat there staring at her lap . Honey , please do n't worry , Jimbo said and lifted her chin . He brushed her lips with a kiss . Please do n't worry . We 'll get married and we 'll have our squirt and everything will work out fine in the end . You 'll see . Just remember God is on our side . God is love itself . And since we 're in love that means what we have is a part of God Himself . We should thank God for what we have . He 's been so good to us . We can thank God by raising this child for the church , Judy said . Her eyes were bright . Dig it , Jimbo said and kissed the palm of Judy 's hand.  |p84Yes  , Judy said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to be a nun . And if it 's a boy we 'll raise him up to be a priest . A priest would be great , Jimbo said and kissed Judy 's shoulder . He might even be a missionary someday , Judy said . Dig it , Jimbo said and softly kissed Judy 's neck . Why , who knows , he might even go on to get himself martyred . Boiled in the Congo . Eaten by savage niggers . Then someday get voted in as a big-shot saint . A bishop , Judy said . He might be a bishop . Or even someday a cardinal . Dig it , Jimbo said and slowly ran his tongue along the edge ofJudy 's jaw . Any squirt of ours is bound to get his name up in lights . Hell , the kid might turn out to be the first pope in history who ai n't a goddamn spaghetti sucker . Oh , Jim , please , please do n't talk like that ! Judy said and pulled away from him . Hey , honey ! I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to him . I did n't mean anything by it . I only meant that any rug rat of ours will turn out to be a star no matter what he does . Well , sometimes you really worry me , Judy said in her pout voice . Sometimes I think you do n't mean to convert at all . Like you promised . Sometimes I think you intend to go on believing in all that crazy , sinful reincarnation stuff forever and burn in hell for it . And Jim Stark , if you intend to burn in hell , well , then I just do n't intend to many you at all . Even if I 'm pregnant . Oh , honey , come on . Do n't sweat it . I promise I wo n't burn in hell . I just told you how thankful we should be to God for our love . And I think raising a squirt for the church is a great idea . And let me tell you , babe , I intend to be one gung-ho , mackerel-snapping , bead-squeezing demon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like that then ? Like you 're making fun of everything ? I do n't mean anything by it , honey . Listen , I 'm serious whenp85I say we should thank God . We should trust God . Do you trust God , honey ? I trust God , Judy said . Trust me too , honey . Please . I trust you . Well , honey , Jimbo said , I guess we best get on with the test . I guess so , Judy said . I love you , babe . I love you too . I really do . Jimbo put his hand on Judy 's knee , then moved it slowly up under her dress , his fingertips gently scraping her hose . When his hand reached the soft flesh of her upper thigh above her hose Judy parted her legs slightly . Jimbo worked his middle finger under the damp crotch of Judy 's panties and after briefly brushing her pubic hair slipped the finger into her pussy . Can you tell anything yet ? Judy asked immediately . Not yet , for Christ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean , like , relax , sweetheart . Relax . I love you , sweetheart . I love you too , Judy said and put her head back on the seat . She shut her eyes and licked her slightly parted lips . Her breath was uneven . We 're so lucky , Jimbo whispered and kissed Judy 's ear . So lucky to have each other and our love . The love God has given us . I love you so much . So much . So much . Jimbo kissed Judy 's eyes , then ran his tongue along the hollows of her throat . He began using two fingers . Do you really and truly love me ? Judy whispered . You bet , Jimbo said . Everything will work out . I just know it will . I know it . I almost hope I am pregnant . Dig it , Jimbo said and began using three fingers . Judy wet Jimbo 's ear with her tongue . When Jimbo kissed her lips Judy opened her mouth and sucked his tongue into it . Judy arched her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thighs . She put a hand overJimbo 's hand and pressedp86it and french kissing deeply they slid slowly down in the seat . Jimbo lifted Judy 's bra and sucked her right nipple gently into his mouth . When Judy screamed Jimbo rolled off her onto the floor . What ? Jimbo yelled . My God , what ? The window ! Judy screamed . A face ! A face was at the window ! Face ! Jimbo cried . He arched quickly up and around off the floor and seeing a face at the window fell backward onto Judy . My nose ! Judy cried . Your elbow 's on my nose ! Jimbo scrambled up off her and seeing the face again froze until he realized it was his own reflection in the glass . There 's no face , Jimbo said . What goddamn face ? There was too ! Judy cried . She pushed frantically at Jimbo trying to get her legs out from under him . There was too ! There was ! Oh , my nose . You broke my nose . I did n't see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Judy slide from under him and sit up behind the steeringwheel . Jimbo reached across her and clicked on the headlights . It was God , Judy said and began to cry . God ? God ? What the hell does that mean ? God ! Jesus Christ ! God made it happen . To stop us . We were getting carried away again . And God made that horrible crazy man peek in our car to stop us from sinning again . Oh , my nose . I just know my nose is broken . Oh bullshit , Judy ! Fucking bullshit ! I almost let God down again , Judy said , crying . But He saved me . And He taught me a lesson . He punished me . He had you break my nose . Fuck it ! Fuck it ! Jimbo yelled and opened the cardoor . What are you doing ? Close that door ! He might still be out there ! I hope he is ! I 'm going to get that creep son of a bitch ! Jimbo jumped out and slammed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the window . What are you doing ? Are you crazy ? Get back in this car ! I 'm going to hunt down that creep , Jimbo said , arching hisp87eyebrows and wrinkling his forehead . Someone has to do it . I guess that someone 's me . Oh , Jim , do n't be so silly . You always try to act so big . Jimbo walked slowly out around the front of the car into the headlights . He stopped and stood legs spread wide apart and looked intently into the dark trees around the small clearing . Dark clouds moved swiftly across the full moon and the wind blew into the trees , twisting their fat leaves in the headlights ' glow . Jimbo arched his eyebrows and wrinkled his forehead and took his switchblade from his windbreaker 's pocket . With an elaborate flick of his wrist he clicked the switchblade open and held it up in the headlights . Oh , creepo . Oh , creepo baby , Jimbo called out . He waved the switchblade before him . Oh , creepo baby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and get it , creepo baby . Jim , quit acting silly ! Judy called . Get back in this car right now ! Jimbo began flipping the switchblade into the air and catchingit by its handle . He began flipping it higher and higher , light flickering like quicksilver on its metal , until it began disappearing for moments into the darkness above the carlights . Jimbo felt light-headed , dizzy almost . Jimbo felt his eyes go away . They went away and then looked back at himself flipping the switchblade in the carlights . They looked back from the trees . When Judy hit the BozoBoat 's siren Jimbo jumped and then for a moment froze , forgetting the switchbladespinning down from the darkness above the carlights until it hit him on the head . Jesus fucking Christ ! Jimbo yelled . He clutched his head and hopped around in the grass . He could hearJudy laughing from the BozoBoat . He looked at his hands . Sure enough , there were traces of blood on his fingers . He held his fingers up in the carlights for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he yelled . I 'm bleeding like a stuck pig and you think it 's funny ! Get back in the car ! Judy called . Jimbo pulled out a handkerchief and held it to his head . He began kicking about in the deep grass searching for hisp88switchblade . Jesus , he thought , what if it had been the fucking blade instead of the handle that drilled him . He had a sudden picture of a quivering switchblade sticking out of his bloody head . Jesus , Jimbo thought , what a joke . What a fucking cartoon . Just as Jimbo spotted his switchblade in the deep grass and reached for it Judy clicked off the carlights . Goddamn it , Judy ! Jimbo yelled . Turn those goddamn lights on ! Jimbo bent over and began feeling around in the grass where he had dropped the switchblade . Snake , he suddenly thought and jerked his hand back . Fuck it ! Fuck it ! Fuck it ! Judy , turn those goddamn lights on ! I mean it , Judy ! Get back in the car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lightly about in the grass . He could not afford to lose another switchblade . It was the third switchblade he had bought in six months and he had shelled out ten bucks for the thing . The other two switchbladeshis dear old mom had discovered while searching his room for dirty poems and had tossed away . The dark clouds over the full moon suddenly parted and in the bright moonlightJimbo spotted a gleam in the grass . He snatched the switchblade from the grass and held it up in the moonlight , looking it over carefully . He waved it screw you , sweetie in Judy 's direction , then closed it and put it back safe in his windbreaker 's pocket . Jimbo dabbed lightly at his head with the handkerchief , then looked at it closely . He was bleeding all right , no mistake about that . Please , please get back in this car ! Judy called , clicking the carlights on and off , on and off . Hey ! Jimbo yelled . He pointed to the trees down the slight slope in front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! The Peeker creep ! Right over there ! Quit that ! Judy called . Please , honey , get back in the car . I got the old Peeker creep spotted , by jove ! And he 's all hairy like an ape , by jove ! Look , Judy ! Over there . Right over there . His face is all hairy , by jove ! You 're not being funny one bit ! Judy called and clicked the carlights back on . I want to leave , Jim . Please.  |p89He  's there , by jove ! He 's right over there and he 's a hairy devil , what . Great scot , the bloke 's a wolfman ! You 're so dumb ! You 're acting like a dumb little kid . Duty calls , my pet . Duty ! God and country . A man has to do what a man has to do ! Jimbo called and saluted the moon . He whipped the switchblade out of his windbreaker 's pocket and with a flourish clicked it open and held it high in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Switchblade ! Hi-ho , Silver , away ! Jimbo shouted and jumped out of the carlights and ran yelling charge , charge down the slope toward the dark trees . Jim ! Jim ! Jim , please ! Please ! Jimbo ducked under the low branches of a spruce at the edge of the clearing and skidded to a stop in the underbrush . He crawled on hands and knees back up the slope to a slight depression under the spruce and flopped there on the soft needle loam and watched the BozoBoat intently . Blood pounded small explosions behind his eyes and in the hollows of his ears . OK , Judy Judy Judy , it 's your turn , baby , Jimbo thought and laughed softly . The carlights ' beams shone brightly into the trees above him . He scraped away a small patch of fallen needles and then while still watching the BozoBoat dug absently at the moist earth with the switchblade . The rich smell of the turned needles and of the moist earth filled his nose . He sniffed the tips of the three middle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under his nose slowly in turn and inhaled deeply . Ah yes , he said and grinned , that was a good year all right . Jimbo stabbed the switchblade into the loose earth to its handle . The wind blew suddenly up and thunder clapped overhead and Jimbo could hear rain hitting higher in the trees . He suddenly snatched the switchblade from the earth and swirled about . What the fuck was that ? Jimbo stared intently into the darkness behind him . He crouched and thrust the switchblade before him . Maybe Judy really had seen a face , he thought and shuddered . Hey , man , just cool it . Captain Nerves of Steel , man . Jimbo arched his eyebrows and wrinkled his forehead and spit out into the darkness . Well , come on , creepo , makep90your move , Jimbo said aloud . Come on and get your cold bite of old Captain 's singing switchblade , creepo baby . Again . Jimbo jumped backward and fell down . He heard it again . He lay on his back and laughed . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Branches in the wind and old CaptainNerves of Steel about shits his pants . Jimbo laughed again . Who 's afraid of the big bad wolf , the big bad wolf ? he chanted quietly . Jim . Jim . Jimbo rolled quickly onto his stomach . Judy was standing behind the BozoBoat 's driver 's side door . Leaving the door open , she slowly rounded it and gazed intently about . Jimbo could hear faint radio music . Jim . Jim , honey . Please , Jim . Judy slowly crept toward the front of the BozoBoat , tiptoeingalmost , running her hand along its fender . When she reached the front she bent near the carlights and stared out their beams into the trees . Rain flicked out of the dark across the carlights and in their glow Judy 's wet face was pale . Please , honey . Are you all right ? Honey , are you OK ? When Jimbo screamed so did Judy . Jimbo screamed and screamed and thrashed wildly about in the brush . Judy screamed and tumbled backward against the cardoor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wolf at a full moon and Judy frantically jerked open the cardoor and scrambled into the BozoBoat . Jimbo rolled over and lay there on his back under the tree alternately laughing and howling , howling like an outlaw wolf at a full moon , imagining himself transformed in moonlight , a face of growing hair , fangs , nails for ripping : howling , howling his ancient beastheart out , a beastheart he could almost imagine remembering . When Judy hit the BozoBoat 's siren Jimbo as always jumped . Jesus fucking Christ ! Jimbo shouted . I swear to God I 'm going to bust hell out of that goddamn horn ! Then Jimbo began to alternately laugh and moo , moo like a cow . Jimbo arched his eyebrows and wrinkled his forehead and mooed like James Dean did at the sirensp91blaring with anger and danger and with fear from somewhere in the dark adult distance . Finally Jimbo rolled onto his stomach laughing , laughing so hard he was almost choking . Ile bit his fist . He pounded the ground . Then he looked up and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he would ever be . What 's going to happen anyway ? Jimbo said quietly to himself . Judy had turned on the BozoBoat 's interior light and was sitting far forward with her weeping face pressed almost against the now rain-streaked windshield , and seeing her weeping face like that , so strangely shadowed , pale and dissolving , staring through water , Jimbo suddenly imagined her , imagined himself , imagined everything , submerged in some deep end , drowned.  |p92Say  your life breaks down . You are only seventeen and already your life breaks down . After wearing it for only three days your girl returns the only ring in the whole wide world : a ring you have gone into a life of crime to buy for her , a life of pulling jobs  --  shoplifting , stealing spinner hubcaps , knocking over parking meters  --  a ring you stole the Second World War for , a job you are now going to pay for dearly . Keep the goddamn ring , Jimbo had told Judy . Judy had cried , cried softly . She still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that at all . And she still wanted more than anything in the world for them to someday marry and to have their twelve children , their six boys and six girls . But they had to be realistic about their love . God had answered her prayers . She was not pregnant after all . God had given her another chance to be good . And she was just being realistic . She knew that if they continued going steady , being together and so intense all the time , they could not keep from going all . the way again and she could not let that happen ever again until they were married . God had forgiven her and she would not let God down again . She would not be bad again until she was married and that was final . So it was best they did not let themselves get into tempting situations if you know what I mean . From now on they would always double date with couples who were not themselves going all the way . And theyp93would go only to shows , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parking . And to be really safe they would not even frenchkiss . And what 's more they should both date other people . Oh , that 's cute , Jimbo said . Well , if our love is real it will last until we can get married someday . Who do you have in mind anyway ? What old flame is waiting in the wings , Judy ? I do n't have anyone in mind . I love you . I really do . We have to be careful , that 's all . Is it good old Hutch ? My old pal old buddy Hutch Bodine ? Old college joe himself ? Is that who it is , Judy ? I do n't have Hutch or anyone in mind . God has given me another chance , that 's all . If I was really thankful I 'd become a nun . Oh Jesus fucking Christ ! Do n't you talk like that ! Well , hell , keep the damn ring anyway . No . I do n't think I should . That 's not fair to you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it to , Judy said and put the only ring in the whole wide world in Jimbo 's hand . Well , suit yourself , babe , Jimbo said , arching his eyebrows . And by the by , babe , just to keep the old record straight , I never intended for a fucking minute to join up with your goddamn bead-squeezing , mackerel-snapping church , dig ? I still believe in that crazy , sinful reincarnation stuff and I always will , dig ? And , babe , if you ask me the goddamn pope is queer as a three-buck bill , dig ? Say your life breaks down . You are only seventeen , it is summer before your senior year , and your life is coming down around your ears . Your old man , old Captain himself , returnedover an hour ago from the first vacation he has taken in ten years , a two-week fishing trip with a couple of old army buddies , and he must have had swell luck for you could hear him happy and hooting around downstairs about all the won/derful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trout around this old house the rest of the goddamn summer , he hooted . Gosh old Captain sure is a great fisherman . Gosh he sure is a great sport . Old Captain can take his stinking trout and stick them up his ass . Old Captain is not really lucky at all . Old Captain sure has a homecoming surprise or two waiting for him all right : just as soon as he goes down into his basement and spots his almost empty battle tables , especially his absolutely empty Battle of the Bulge table . So Jimbo lay there on his bed smoking and waiting and now and then examining the only ring in the whole wide world squeezed on his thumb tip and he was sick to his stomach . It was only a matter of time . It was only a matter of time . Jimbo smoked and waited . He looked up at the silver cones hanging from the ceiling , hanging in place of all those plastic fighter planes he once had strung up there in some strange freezeframedogfight . Jimbo smoked and waited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all of his heart he was safely deep within one of their strange gangster dreams . Jimbo felt around under his pillow for the one soldier he had kept : Captain 's special soldier , the one who always led the victors to their glory , no matter what battle of what army of what age . Jimbo held it up and examined its elaborate , bright blue and red , silver-trimmed uniform , its silver , high-pointed , plumed helmet . Jimbo had not sold it with the rest . He could have scored a few bucks off the bozo thing all right but he did not . Maybe if he gave Captain back his special bozo soldier Captain would only break his arms and legs . Sure . Hell , Jimbo thought , he might as well keep the thing as a goddamn souvenir . His very own personal Second World War bozo hero souvenir . Jimbo stuffed the bozo soldier back under his pillow . And all for this , he thought , holding up the only ring in the whole wide world . In the dim light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diamond and surrounding heart of small perfect pearls glittered faintly . It 's not fair to you blah blah , she had said . You might find someone else you want to give it to blah blah blah . Fuck her . He should have stuffed it up herp95ass . Stuffed it up her precious pussy . Knocked her up with the only ring in the whole wide world . Puffed her pussy with pearls . Tears suddenly flooded Jimbo 's eyes and he threw the only ring in the whole wide world against the far wall . He listened with pain as it bounced about . Well , hell , she is a fine girl , Jimbo thought . Goddamn it anyway . And he was a jerk . An asshole . That 's for sure . To give her all that punk grief . Jesus Christ . Jesus fucking Christ . Oh , well . Hell , what old Captain Boohoo needs right now is a little distraction . A little entertainment is just what old Captain needs . Damn right . Like a good old whack-off . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good old basic whack-off . One last mythic whack-off in honor ofJudy-poo 's pussypie , by God . Jimbo stubbed out his Camel , then rolled onto his stomach and felt around under the bed for the sock . Well , here goes your basic terminal case of the hairy palms and pimples , Jimbo thought and laughed . He rolled onto his back and unzipped his jeans . It was an old athletic sock with blue and green stripes around its top and it was stiff as a corpse . Jimbo crunched it gently in his hands until it softened . Jimbo shut his eyes . Jimbo opened his eyes . The hell with this , he thought and tossed the sock back under the bed . He zipped up his jeans quickly . Jesus . What if Captain happened to come marching in about right now . Captain comes stomping in to square off with Jimbo and there Jimbo is flopping his dork . That would be cute all right . About as bad as that time old Captain nearly stared a hole through Jimbo 's dork . How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Seventh grade , anyway . When on a dare he had put an unwrapped cherry popsicle in his homeroom teacher 's top desk drawer to melt . What a neat mess it had made . Sticky cherry juice all over everything , even gluing the grade book 's pages together . Old bitch Scott had really shit a brick all right . She 'd stomped and hooted around like crazy . And old bitch Scott had suspected Jimbo right away , of course , for although he had the highest grades of anyone in the homeroom she had his number as a troublemaker . He would never help clean the erasers and he wasp96always squeezing his hands together making obscene fart sounds and whenever it was his turn to lead the class in either the Lord 's Prayer or the Pledge of Allegiance to the Flag he would quack them like his favorite cartoon character Donald Duck . A troublemaker for sure . So when some fink squealed that Jimbo had , indeed , put the popsicle in her desk drawer old bitch Scott had cackled and jabbered with hateful joy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's office . Jimbo had been immediately suspended for three days and sent home where he went directly to the bathroom and sat on the commode to wait . Somehow he felt that if he was sitting on the commode Captain would not immediately break his arms and legs when he got home . After all , no one walks in on someone taking a shit , Jimbo figured . Then maybe Captain would have a chance to calm down . It did not work . Captain had thrown open the bathroom door and charged in yelling and slapping at Jimbo who was in turn crying , I 'm on the commode ! I 'm on the commode ! Jimbo jumped up and with his pants down around his ankles tried vainly to hop to safety . I 'm on the commode ! Jimbo kept crying as he hopped about trying to duck under Captain 's slaps . Then suddenly Captain stopped slapping and Jimbo peeked up through his guarding arms and he saw that Captain was staring a hole through his dork . Only then did Jimbo realize with amazement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they both flushed and looked quickly away . Captain turned abruptly and stalked from the bathroom . Jimbo flopped back down on the commode . He sat there on the commode and held his face in his hands . Jimmy . Jimbo jumped up off the bed . His mother was standing in the doorway . She was clutching her bathrobe to her throat . Why do n't you ever knock ? Jimmy , what in the world have you done this time ? she asked . Her eyes were wide and bright . Done ? I have n't done anything . Why do n't you ever knock anyway ? This is my room you know.  |p97Well  , your dad wants to see you . He says for you to come down to the shelter . What in the world did you do this time , honey ? I 've never seen him so . . . Well , I 've never seen him like this . I did n't do anything I said . And I 'm not going down to his damn shelter . Well , he says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him like this before . I 'm not going down there I said . I 'm busy . You best do what he says , honey . I 'm busy I said . I do n't know . I just do n't know what to think . I 've never seen him like this . Honey , you better go down . No , damn it ! I 'm busy ! I just do n't know what to think . I try and try and it does n't do a bit of good . I pray for you all the time . And I pray for your dad . I 'm so sickly and all and you give me nothing but more worries . The both of you . Well , I 'll tell your dad you wo n't come down I guess . I 've never seen him like this before , Jimbo 's mother said , shaking her head and turning away slowly . Hey , close that door too . And how 's about knocking for a change ? Oh Jesus fucking Christ , Jimbo said aloud . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt dizzy . He had a sudden urge to crawl under the bed . He could not believe it . He held his hands up in front of his face . They were actually trembling . He shut his eyes and leaned back against the wall . Well , big bad boy , this is it , Jimbo thought . The big squareoff . Because by God , he was not going to let Captain just pound around on him this time . This time he would fight back , by God . If Captain came in swinging he would swing back . Goddamn right , Jimbo thought , arching his eyebrows and wrinkling his forehead . The big squareoff . The big showdown . Jimbo suddenly picturedCaptain 's huge , hairy hands , his thick , powerful fingers . More like the last showdown , Jimbo thought and smiled grimly . He leaned there against the wall with his eyes shut , feeling weak , and he thought of the ending of Red River , ap98movie ending he had thought about a lot lately , an ending he had rerun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wayne , big as a barn , stalking through scattering cattle toward where Montgomery Clift waited in the dusty cow-town street for their big showdown . John Wayne had been like a father to Montgomery Clift , had taught him how to ride and rope and shoot and how to quickdraw with the best . John Wayne had taught Montgomery Clift everything and they had loved each other like father and son and now they were going to gun each other down like dogs in the street . Wayne thought Clift had stolen his herd of Texas longhorns but Clift had not really and when it came down to it Clift could not quickdraw against Wayne . Wayne tried to force Cliffs hand . Wayne quickdrew and scattered hot lead all about Clift , once even grazing his cheek , but Clift just would not go for his big iron . What 's it take to make you act like a man ? Wayne said and stalked right up to Clift and punched his face . Wayne punched Clift again and again , belting him bloody all about the dusty cow-town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let fly . Clift let fly with a roundhouse haymaker right and caught big John flush on the jaw . Wayne went down like a ton of bricks with a look of surprise and , more important , pride spread on his kisser . A good one ! A haymaker right smack in the kisser . And John Wayne , John Wayne , big as a barn , big as all outdoors , went down on his ass . And of course John Wayne forgave MontgomeryClift and they loved each other like father and son once again . And to prove his love John Wayne drew the ranch 's new brand in the sand with a stick : a brand using both their names ' initials . Blam , a roundhouse haymaker smack on John Wayne 's kisser . Jimbo kept rerunning the surprised but proud look on John Wayne 's face as he sat on his ass in the dusty cow-town street looking up at Clift . Blam . Blam . Pow . Socko . Jimbo danced around the room tossing lefts and rights , tossing jabs , uppercuts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stairs and he quickly backed to the wall farthest from the door and held his breath . Jimbo listened as Captain walked heavily down the hallwayp99to the bedroom door . Jimbo could hear Captain 's heavy smoker 's rattle as he then just stood there outside the door . What the fuck is he waiting for ? Jimbo thought . Make your tucking move , cowboy . At last Captain slowly opened the door and Jimbo thought he would piss his pants . Captain just stood there framed in the hall light , his big-as-a-barn , big-as-alloutdoorsbody a massive shadow filling the doorway , blocking all hope of escape . I want to talk to you , soldierboy , Captain , after what seemed to Jimbo minutes , at last said in a quiet voice not of the Second World War at all . Yes , sir . Captain clicked on the overhead light and Jimbo blinked in the brightness . Then Captain just stood there not speaking again . He was weaving slightly and he lightly pressed the backs of his hands against the doorframe to steady himself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes looked swollen and watery and he blinked them often . Fisheyes , Jimbo suddenly thought . They made him think of bulging , filmy fish eyes staring out through the thick glass sides of some aquarium . And there was no glint , no look , in those strange fish eyes Captain could not seem to focus on Jimbo 's face : they seemed not even to reflect light , but to absorb it , suck it in , flat , lifeless . Did you have a good trip , sir ? Jimbo said at last . Where are they ? Captain said . What , sir ? Where are they ? Where 's what , sir ? Where are they , soldierboy ? I took them and sold them . You took them and sold them ? Yes , sir . You sold them ? Where ? Well , I sold some down at Bob 's Hobby Shop . But most of them I just sold around to kids . You know , just around the neighborhood.  |p100You  sold them ? Yes , sir . Why ? I had to buy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sir . What ? A ring . A what ? A ring , sir . A ring ? A ring for Judy . A ring for Judy ? Captain said and stepped on into the room . He shut the door behind him . Yeah , a ring for Judy , Jimbo said . It cost four hundred buckeroos . Four hundred what ? Buckeroos . Bucks . Dollars . A four-hundred-dollar ring for Judy , Captain said and walked slowly toward Jimbo . Right , Jimbo said . He clenched his fists at his sides . Captain 's head bumped a silver cone and he stopped and stared at it . He blinked his eyes . As though in slow motion Captain reached up and touched the silver cone . He stopped its spinning and then just held it still and stared at it . He squinted his wet eyes . With a slight tug he pulled the cone 's string loose from the ceiling . Captain turned the silver cone over and over in his huge hands , examining it intently with his wet , blinking eyes . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the hell Captain had raised when Jimbo had first taken the plastic fighter planes down and put up the silver cones . There 's nothing new about those things . They were the same old silver cones . A fish , Jimbo suddenly thought . The silver cone looked like a small silver fish in Captain 's huge hands . As though Captain had just landed it and was getting all set top101gut it . Jimbo pictured Captain carrying the still twitching silver cone grimly toward him . Jimbo pictured Captain slowly rubbing the still twitching silver cone over his face , until at last it hung limp and dead . Captain tossed the silver cone onto Jimbo 's bed . He looked back at Jimbo , still blinking his wet eyes as though trying to focus them . In the bright overhead light his face looked lined and old and his shoulders were slumped like Jimbo had never seen them before . Attention ! Jimbo suddenly had an urge to yell . Shoulders back ! Belly in ! Left face right face about-face ! So you sold them ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the battle tables . You sold all the rest ? Yes , sir . How much money did you get for everything , Jimbo ? I do n't remember exactly . You do n't remember exactly ? No , sir . I did n't exactly keep count . You did n't exactly keep count , Captain said and rubbed his lined forehead with his hand like some strange , slow salute . Here 's the ring I bought , Jimbo said and bent to pick up the only ring in the whole wide world from where he had spotted it glittering faintly on the floor . He held it up in the light . Two of its small perfect pearls were missing . Judy gave it back to me . It 's almost as good as new . Except a couple of its pearls are gone . You want it , Dad ? What , Jimbo ? The ring . You want the ring , Dad ? You can have it , Jimbo said and held the ring out . You can sell it and maybe get your things back . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call your Grandma Carver , Jimbo , Captain said quietly and ran his fingers back through his hair . I 'm going to call her tonight and see if you can live with her down in Hundred Mines next year . You can finish up highschool down there . Here , Dad , why do n't you go on and take it ? I 'll pay your expenses and she 's got plenty of room in thatp102old house so it will probably be all right with her . She can probably use some help around there . And I 'll send you some allowance I guess . Here , Dad , please take the ring . Please . You can sell it . I do n't want to live with Grandma , Dad . I do n't want you to live here anymore , Jimbo . Hey , Dad , here 's the ring . Please , Dad . I do n't want your goddamn ring , soldierboy , Captain said and turned and walked from the room , closing the door quietly behind him . It was the night of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the next morning to Hundred Mines to live with his grandmother . His dear old mom had spent two days washing and ironing his clothes and now he was all packed and ready to blow this burg . Here he had stolen the whole Second World War from his old man and he had gotten off scot-free . His old man had not laid a hand on him . His old man had only tossed him out on his ass but who in the fuck cared anywa  --  imbo was bored with this burg anyway . In Hundred Mines he 'd be a big frog in a punk pond . He 'd screw every halfway clean coal miner 's daughter he could find . Jimbo was going to celebrate his last night in this burg by cruising around town with his best buddies Boots and Pace in Pace 's planed and decked and lowered midnight blue ' 49 Ford and by getting drunk as a skunk on orange-flavored sloe gin and by at long last kicking the shit out of Hutch Bodine . Jimbo , sitting at his desk , checked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him up . He fired up a Camel and glanced through his notebook of poems once again . Now and then he stopped to read a poem through , trying as he did to imagine Judy reading it , to imagine her sorrow , her heartache , as she realized what she had done . Jimbo put the notebook and the letter in a large already addressed envelope and sealed it . Well , that 's that , he thought and smiled . He had destroyed all other copies he had of his poems . Judy would have the only copy in the whole wide world to do with as she wished . Andp103he did not give a damn what she did with it . She could throw it in the river for all he cared . He was through with that sort of sissy shit . He would never again write another poem . There was a light knock at the door . Yeah , Jimbo said . He pushed his chair back and swung his feet up on the desk . It 's just me , Jimmy , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I got some hankies here I forgot to pack for you . That 's what I need all right , Jimbo said , frenchinhaling deeply . Your basic snot-rags . Jimbo 's mother arranged the handkerchiefs in the open suitcase on the bed . There , that ought to hold you for a while , she said . She retied the belt of her bathrobe and then , hummingsoftly , she walked slowly , aimlessly , around the room touching things . You know , this is a nice room . It gets that nice morning sun and all . I know , Jimbo said . Jimbo 's mother walked over to the bedroom 's front window and pulled back the curtains : cowboy curtains , she had called them when years earlier she had made them special for Jimbo'sbedroom , made them from cloth decorated with horses ' heads . She stood there humming and staring out into the frontyard and street . God 's ways are ways of mystery , she said after a time and absently patted her cheek with long , flutteringfingers . So maybe it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me being ill and all . Maybe you staying with your grandma is what God thinks is best right now . I do n't know . Maybe so . Maybe . We are n't what you 'd call a happy family right now I guess . I wish we were a happy family . Maybe when I get cured things will be happier around here . I pray for it every night . Right , Jimbo said , stubbing out his Camel and immediately lighting another . Happy , happy . Just like on teevee . Like the Nelsons . Like Father Knows Best . I used to be so happy when I was a girl . And pretty too I 'll tell you . And I was always so gay . So lighthearted . I was always singing and laughing . You remember the laughs we used to have ? When you were little ? You remember how we'dp104sit out in the kitchen after supper and listen to all our favorite radio shows ? You remember that , Jimmy ? I remember . Did n't we have some laughs back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monkeys . And I 'd make up stories for us about riding a train all the way to Hollywood where I 'd get discoveredand we 'd be filthy rich and buy us a big fancy house with a big old swimming pool . And I 'd get a pony with a silver-trimmed saddle . And I was pretty enough too . Everyone used to say so . We sure had some fun , you and me . Yeah , Jimbo said . We had some fun . Oh , well . Oh , well . God 's ways are ways of mystery . I guess everything is just a test . Life is just one big test . You know I 'll miss you , you stinker . I know we fuss a lot around here but I 'll miss you . Yeah . I 'll miss you too , Mom . Really . Well , I 'll be down to visit you and Mom whenever I feel up to it . And your dad did n't say anything about you not visiting here . Forget it . Well , your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down . I do n't give a damn what he does , dig ? I pray every night for things to get happier around here . And I have faith they will . Just as soon as I 'm cured . You 'll see . I think I 'll say a little prayer for us right now , Jimbo 's mother said and shut her eyes and began moving her lips silently . Jimbo watched her . He squinted his eyes and stared at her . Although she was only feet from him she seemed strangely far away , as though he was observing an image of her that had been in some way magnified from far away : as though she was not happening here and now with the room at all . The more intently Jimbo stared the more rarefied with clarity and sharpness her features became , yet always with that sense of magnified distance . Then her image seemed to slowly recede . Past the window she went , out into the evening yard into thep105darkening trees , then beyond . Jimbo squinted . his eyes at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the window into the evening shadows . Who is she ? Jimbo wondered . Who is she ? Who is she ? God 's ways are ways of mystery , Jimbo 's mother said aloud and turned from the window to look at him . Jimbo shook his head slightly and blinked his eyes , trying to focus on her here and now evening-shadowed face . Streetlight coming through the window behind her trimmed her hair like a thin encircling flame . Yeah , sure , Jimbo said . Like , amen . Yeah , sure , she repeated , imitating his voice . Like , amen . Honestly , Jimmy , what 's going to come of you ? I swan to gracious I do n't know . Suddenly she laughed , giving her head a slight toss , and in the desk lamp 's light her white teeth flashed and the electric glow about her hair shimmered in the dark . In the soft light laughing she looked almost young and beautiful again . Smiling , she walked over to the bed and fussed briefly with the packed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come visit I promise I wo n't be so gloomy all the time , she said , still smiling . Amen , Jimbo said . Amen is right . Yes , indeedy , I will be downright lighthearted . We 'll have us some laughs like the old days . Anyway , I have what you might call a little bon voyage surprise for you . Gee , you should n't have , Jimbo said . Oh , it 's not much . Just a trifle . Just an old book actually . An old book someone gave me once . Your basic Gideon Bible . Now , do n't you be cute , young man . No , it 's not a Bible although that 's not a bad idea at all . Anyhow , it 's packed in here under your socks . I hope it has pictures . Oh , you , Jimbo 's mother said and walked over beside him . Well , I guess I better get some supper for your dad . You surep106you wo n't come on down and eat a bite with us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I just know . I bet your dad would even like it . Forget it . I 'm going out with the guys anyway . Oh , please do n't get in any trouble . Please behave . Sure . I promise I wo n't do anything you would n't do . You stinker you , she said and roughed Jimbo 's hair and winked . You sure are a handsome devil , I 'll say that . I just hope you 'll turn out a good boy . Well , I 'd actually settle for a pretty good boy . I 'd be happy with that I guess . And be lighthearted . You can be lighthearted and good too . You do n't have to turn out gloomy like me just because you 're good . Well , I ' promise I wo n't turn out gloomy anyway . What about being good ? Do n't I get any credit around here ? Did n't I tell you that my dirty-poem-writing days are over ? I 've turned in my dirty quill for good . How 's them apples @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so good or not after all . I do n't know . I used to know someone who sure liked poems . I think I was just being gloomy about those poems . I do n't know . Sometimes I think I 've just been going around here like a wicked old stepmother or something . What if I told you I was taking up praying instead of poeming for a hobby ? You stinker you . I 'd say you 'd best watch your nose does n't start growing right off your silly face . That 's what you get for fibbing . That 's what I 'd say . Well , I just have to get busy on supper . Please behave tonight , you hear now ? As soon as his mother had left the room Jimbo rummaged through the suitcase on the bed . Well I 'll be damn , he thought when he found the book . Your old basic Sonnets from the Portuguese . Your old basic How do I love thee syndrome . Jimbo turned the thin leather-bound book around in his hands , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said aloud and laughed quietly . Let me count the basic ways blah blah . I love thee to the depth and breadth and blah blah my soul can reach blah blah blah . So someone once laid old love sonnet cityp107on old Mom . Love sonnet city . Damn . Jimbo looked for an inscription . The title page had been carefully cut out . Jimbo smiled and put the book back in the suitcase under his socks . Well , boy , this is the night of the big sendoff , Jimbo thought find checked his watch . He shadowboxed for a few minutes in front of the full-length mirror on the back of his bedroom door . Blam blam pow socko . Blarn blam Hutch Bodine . Blam your ass is grass tonight , baby ! Jimbo laughed and flopped on his bed . He was going to kiss this two-bit burg good-bye in style , by God . Shit yes , man . Hell , he was n't being run out of this two-bit burg like a goddamn dog with his tail tucked . Hell , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God ! Ile was going to kiss this two-bit burg good-fucking-bye in style , man . But first , Jimbo thought and checked his watch again , how about taking a little time out for a final whack-off . Yes , siree . Now that just might hit the old spot . A little old whack-off for old time 's sake . It would probably be the last whack-off this old bed would ever see . This bedroom . It was on August 15 in the Lord 's year of 1959 that our hero Captain Rebel Without No Cause last took dork in hand and for a final time puffed his imaginary honey 's pussypie with pearls . Yes , siree , Jimbo said and unzipped his jeans . He rolled over onto his stomach and felt around under the bed for the sock . He did n't know what to think when he found the sock . He rolled over onto his back and held the soft , limp , laundered sock up before his eyes . Jimbo just did n't know what to think.  |p108The  movie continues . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sit in the L.A. Planetarium 's darkened auditorium , a projection of the universe glowing on the dome above them like a giant expanding movie , on whose curved screen the lecturer may at will expose stars , inflate galaxies , collapse constellations , or just spin them near for a closeup . For many days before the end of our earth , the lecturer drones , people will look into the night sky and notice a new star , an increasingly bright and increasingly near new star . New at Dawson High School and arriving late for the field trip to the planetarium , James Dean , perfectly on cue , enters the darkened auditorium . When in a stage whisper he announceshis name to the teacher checking names at the door the lecturer hesitates and all of the students turn in unison to stare at James Dean . Letting his lower face collapse into smiles , James Dean slouches to a seat . As this star approaches us the weather will change , the lecturer drones on . The great polar fields of the north and south will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Whew , James Dean sighs , leaning back in his seat and looking up at the projected stars . Once you 've been up there , you really know you 've been someplace , he says quietly to no one in particular.  |p109As  the lecture on the nature of the universe continues , the le cturer points out constellations and describes them and tells the students their myths . And this is the crab constellation , Cancer , the lecturer says . Hey , I 'm a crab , Buzz , the leader of the pack , says and walks his fingers across Natalie Wood 's breasts and pinches Goon 's nose . The other pack members giggle . James Dean , sitting several rows behind them , lets his lower face collapse into smiles . And this is Taurus , the bull , the lecturer drones . Moo , James Dean moos . M00000000 . The members of the pack turn around and stare at James Dean . Nobody laughs . Yeah , moo , Crunch says . Moo . That 's real cute . Moo , Buzz says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I bet he fights with cows , Crunch says . Moo , Buzz says . James Dean slumps back in his seat . You should n't monkey with Buzz , Sal Mineo whispers from where he is sitting in his movierole Plato behind James Dean . What ? Buzz is a wheel . So 's Judy . It 's hard to make friends without them . I do n't want to make friends , James Dean says . Later , outside the planetarium in the dazzling L.A. sunlight , Crunch asks Buzz what they can do now for kicks . What about Moo ? Goon suggests . OK , Buzz says . OK . Moo . James Dean , sitting on a parapet outside the planetarium , watches the pack circle his raked black Mercury parked in the driveway below . Dancelike , Buzz swings Natalie Wood around beside the raked Mercury 's right front fender and she hops up on it and dangles her beautiful nylon-stockinged leg beside the right front whitewall . Taking out his switchblade , Buzz kneels slowly and clicks the knife open . Only inches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's tip against the tire . He hesitates a moment , then plunges the switchbladep110deep into the whitewall . They all stare up at James Dean . James Dean lets out a slow painful breath of air and slides from the parapet and slouches slowly down the winding driveway to where the pack waits patiently around the wounded raked Mercury . You know something ? James Dean says wearily as he walks past Buzz . What ? Buzz asks , grinning . You read too many comic books , James Dean says and opens his Mercury 's trunklid and takes out a tireiron . Hey , Buzz says to the pack . Moo is real abstract . I 'm cute , too , James Dean says , taking off his sportcoat and tossing it onto the trunklid . He slouches slowly around the Mercury to the stabbed whitewall . Suddenly Goon begins clucking softly like a chicken . One by one the other pack members pick it up . Buzz , the last , crows loudly . Does that mean m  --  ames Dean yells and draws back the tireiron . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his cheek . Chicken ! When on cue James Dean has finally been egged into picking up the switchblade someone tossed to his feet to knife-fight Buzz says : Remember , no cutting , just sticking . Jab real cool . I thought only punks fought with knives , James Dean says . Who 's fighting ? Buzz says . This is the test , man . It 's only a crazy game . James Dean and Buzz circle each other , their switchblades flashing in the dazzling L.A. sunlight . Buzz snarls , grins , rolls his tongue in his cheek . James Dean is hesitant , awkward . The L.A. sunlight is fierce . Things seem to steam in the heat . The heat presses James Dean 's shoulders and back . It begins to scorch his cheeks and beads of sweat gather in his eyebrows . He thinks suddenly of the horrible heat at his mother 's funeral that day long ago in the Midwest . Veins seem to be burstingp111through the skin of his forehead . It strikes James Dean that all 1w would have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think no more about it . Go back to the Midwest maybe and think no more about movies . Suddenly a shaft of light shoots upward from Buzz 's knife and James Dean feels it as if a long , thin blade has transfixed his forehead . Sweat from his eyebrows splashes down , covering his eyes , and beneath the veil of brine and tears he is almost blind . Buzz is a blurred dark form dancing in the heat haze . James Dean is aware only of the keen blade of light flashing up from Buzz 's knife . Everything begins to reel . James Dean lunges at Buzz who steps easily aside . Oh , that was cute , Moo , Buzz says and laughs . The other pack members laugh , laugh . James Dean makes another quick , awkward lunge and Buzz deftly jabs Dean 's stomach with his switchblade . A spot of blood blossomson James Dean 's shirt . Cut ! Cut ! Nick Ray , the director , yells when he spots the blood . He calls frantically for a first-aid man . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Nick Ray . Ca n't you see I 'm having a goddamn real moment ? Do n't you ever cut a scene while I 'm having a goddamn real moment !

They are parked up on Snake Road in what was once Jimbo and Judy 's special spot overlooking the city 's lights , radio blaring , the midnight blue ' 49 Ford 's doors wide open , the headlights on . This is the third time they have checked the special spot this evening . They have driven slowly past Judy 's house five times and past Hutch Bodine 's house four . They have cruised the town 's main downtown drag and through the Beacon DriveIn'sparking lot a dozen times each . No sign yet of Judy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Ford 's warm hood with their backs pressed against the cool windshield passing a pint of sloe gin between them . Boots , at sixteen a year younger and sort of Jimbo 's sidekick , is bopping about in the carlights in time to the blaring rock and roll whilep113he slashes and stabs at invisible foes with his brand-new switchblade . Hutch Bodine is going to fall , man , Jimbo says and takes a pull from the pint , then passes it to Pace . Hutch Bodine is bad news , Pace says . He is going to fall , Jimbo says , arching his eyebrows . His ass is grass and I am a power mower , dig ? Well , man , like , I ai n't poor-mouthing your fistic abilities , dig ? I mean , like , I 've seen your action , right ? You 're no pussy , man . But Hutch Bodine , man . Hutch Bodine .

Some asshole trainer you are . You 're fired , man . I 'm going to get a new trainer . A trainer who has faith in me . Damn it ! I 'm telling you Captain College is going to fall , Jimbo says and smacks his sock-covered right fist into his left palm . What the fuck are you wearing that sock on your hand for anyway , man ? You 're getting crazy as batshit . This is your basic clean and well-laundered sock , man , Jimbo says and holds his sock-covered fist up like a hand puppet , his fingers and thumb its mouth . Its name is Plato , Say hello to Uncle Pace , Plato . Hello , Uncle Pace , you cocksucker , Plato the puppet quacks . Plato sounds like fucking Donald @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of gin . Yeah , well , old Plato may sound like Donald Duck but he knows some shit . He knows that Captain College is going to fall tonight . Plato has faith in me . Faith . That figures , Pace says . Fucking Donald Duck . Plato is my new trainer , man . Because Plato has faith . Yes , I 'm Jimbo 's new trainer , Plato quacks . And in myp114expert trainer 's opinion Jimbo needs another hit off that pint so pass it , Uncle Pace , you cocksucker . Quack , quack , Pace says and passes the pint . Yes , old Plato knows all right . Plato knows I 'll kick shit out of Hutch Bodine , man , because Plato knows God is with me . Destiny is on my side , man . Fate , man . We heroes know who we are . The stars , man . The stars are with me . Quackshit , Pace says and takes a hit of gin . Let 's talk about something important . Let 's talk about pussy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Plato 's mouth . Ah , pussy , Pace says . What the fuck am I doing driving you around town so you can find Hutch Bodine and get your ass kicked when my sweet Penny and her pussyquack are at home all alone ? All alone and unfulfilled . Yeah , pussy , Jimbo says and shuts his eyes tightly . Pass that fucking pint , man . My baby loves the western movies . The radio blares from the planed and decked and lowered midnight blue ' 49 Ford : My baby loves the western movies . Boots still bops about in the carlights slashing imaginary monsters with his brand-new switchblade . Do n't slice your quack ass off , Jimbo calls to him . Hey , man , I 'm a cool cat , Boots calls back and snapping his fingers bops over to the car . Cool cats do n't get cut , man . Hey , you really gon na lay this blade on me ? For keeps ? It 's all yours , Jimbo says . For quack keeps . It 's your very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care of it , man . It 's special . I had to pull that sucker out of a magic stone to get it . I was the only cat in the realm who could do it . Everyone had tried to pull it out . All the big shots . Knights , princes , the king , the goddamn Duke of Earl . But I was the only one who could pull the sucker out . Dig it , Boots says . Quackshit , Pace says . Let 's roll , Jimbo says and takes Plato off his hand and stuffsp115it in his red windbreaker 's pocket along with Captain 's bozo troy soldier . Jimbo slides down off the hood and bounces around in the carlights flicking punches . Well , man , I do n't see Bodine anywhere , Pace says , as he slowly cruises his midnight blue ' 49 Ford down the town 's main drag . Why do n't you just forget it , man ? Fuck it . Quack it , man .

What you gettin ' so hot about , man ? Boots says . Cool it , Jimbo says . He takes a swallow of warm beer from a bottle . He is lying in the backseat , his feet sticking out the left window . Try the Beacon again , Pace . It 's your ass , Pace says and peels out . Jimbo takes another swallow of warm beer and through his squinted eyes watches the lush neon lights along the drag as they gather like schools of small , bright tropical fish in the curved rear window , then flow and fade dreamlike . It had been in this very backseat . Jimbo and Judy had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this very backseat . Jimbo polishes off the warm beer with a final big pull and tosses the empty bottle onto the floor . One more dead soldier , Jimbo says . Pop me another brew , Boots . Well , man , Pace says , as he deftly left-turns off the busy drag into the Beacon 's parking lot , you finally bought it . Bodine 's here , man . Hot shit ! Boots yells . Action , man . Stark is gon na bring that asshole down , man . Is Judy with him ? Jimbo asks.  |p116No  , man , Pace says . Bodine 's sitting on his hood shooting the shit with some of his flunky cronies . They 're all parked at the end of the lot . So what 's the script , man ? Just pull in somewhere . I want to kill this goddamn beer . Hey , man , Pace says , as he slides his bomb into a vacant slot , I actually think you can take Bodine . I was just jiving you about him kicking your ass , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to be a bad news brawl . And you 've been boozing all night . You 've been boozing like it 's going out of style , man . You 're half shitfaced . Half , my ass , Jimbo says , laughing . Total , man . I 'm wrecked . Dig it , man , Pace says . Listen , why do n't you fight the cocksucker sometime when you 're straight ? Then you can really kick his ass proper , man . I 'm pretty shitfaced all right , Jimbo says . Right , Pace says . And from here Bodine looks sober as a goddamn judge . I 'd love to see you kick his ass , man . Take the punk on when you 're straight , man . Boring , Boots says . Fuck , man , Stark can take Bodine anytime . Drunk as a skunk , man . Do n't matter , man . Stark is a mean man . Shut your fucking mouth , man , Pace says . Hey , you assholes , cool it , Jimbo says . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? We 're a team , dig ? Anyway , Boots is right . I 'm a real mean man . You 're a jerk , Pace says . Quack you , man . Get your ass quacked , man . It 's not my ass . Hey , Pace , old pal , Jimbo says and sitting up in the seat pats Pace 's shoulder . The stars , man . The stars are right , re-member ? Quack the stars , toughboy . I do n't have a choice . The fuck you do n't , man . You got a choice . No , I do n't , man . Action , Boots laughs . Gon na have some action tonight . Action , Jimbo says quietly and opens the cardoor.  |p117You  sure you do n't want your blade back ? Boots says . Knife-fighting is for punks , man , Jimbo says . He zips his red windbreaker up to his throat and pulls its collar up in back . Resides , man , I got one fist of iron and the other of steel and if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one will . I can dig it , man . Boots laughs . Quackshit , Pace says . I do n't reckon one of you seconds would like to double for me , Jimbo says , letting his lower face collapse into smiles . Double for you my ass , Pace says . I 'll dub in your quack screams for you though . Hey , pal , thanks , Jimbo says and pats Pace 's shoulder . Action , Boots says . Let 's rumble . Right , man , Jimbo says and fires up a Camel . Action . Lights . Scene one . Take one . Camera . Roll ' em . Jimbo polishes off his beer , drops the dead soldier onto the backseat floor with the others , and climbs slowly out of the car . Whew , he thinks , leaning back against the door . Fuck , I am shitfaced . Whew . Jimbo squints his eyes in the strange bluegreen light , light in which he feels submerged , light he can almost imagine as water . Jimbo shakes his head to clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he climbs out of the car . Fine as wine , Jimbo says , arching his eyebrows and wrinklinghis forehead . He takes the Camel from his lips with his left hand and flicks its ash . He stuffs his right hand into his windbreaker 's pocket and squeezes Captain 's bozo toy soldier . He squeezes it until he feels pain . Jesus , he thinks . Steady , boy . Jimbo puts the Camel back in his lips and shakes his head again . He rubs his eyes and gazes slowly around the packed parking lot . Everything looks so goddamn strange , all the cars , the people , as though they are all slightly out of proportion somehow , slightly larger or smaller than they should be , as though he is , actually , seeing them through water . And in the strange , submerged bluegreen light the colors seem so intensely technicolor they burn his eyes . Jimbo tightens his grip on the toy soldier in his pocket and tries to push erect from the cardoor : but suddenly dizzy , almost sick to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , boy , Jimbo thinks to himself , shutting his eyes . Ca n't lose it . Got to stay in touch . Hey , man , just fuck it , Pace says . You 're in no fucking shape to tangle with anyone , man . Much less Hutch Bodine . You can hardly stand up , man . Let 's take a drive and get some air . Then come back later . Dig , man ? I did n't know I was getting so fucked up , man , Jimbo says , rubbing his closed , aching eyes . Come on , man , Pace says . Let 's cruise for a while . Maybe you 're right , Jimbo says . Let me think a minute , man . Jimbo takes a deep breath and leans his head back on the cartop . He watches the beams from the two huge searchlightson the Beacon 's roof as they sweep across the gatheringsummery rainclouds like swift , ghostly moons . Opening night , Jimbo thinks as he watches the searchlights . Your basic Hollywood premiere . The premiere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the Beacon Drive-In . Pace was right . Captain Rebel Without a Cause was going to be the star at his own asskicking . Well , at least he was going to be the star of something . There 's just no fucking way I can beat Hutch Bodine , Jimbo thinks , closing his aching eyes and rubbing them . Hey , daddy , Boots says , lightly rapping Jimbo 's shoulder . Get a load of who just made the scene . Jimbo opens his eyes and blinks them , trying to focus.Judy . Driving a load of giggling girlfriends in one of her old man 's fancy black Lincolns . Jimbo and Judy 's eyes meet and Judy glances away . Laughing and waving often to friends in other cars , Judy idles the Lincoln along in the bumper-to-bumper cruising drive-in traffic . Finally , she pulls into a vacant slot only three cars away from Hutch Bodine 's Mean Green Machine , a 1958 green Impala with long chrome lakes and glass-pac mufflers , a bomb almost as famous far and wide as the Silver Ghost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not even out with Bodine tonight , man . Like I told you , Penny just saw them out at thep119Country club together today . She did n't know if they had a date anything . They were hanging out together all afternoon , Jimbo says . You said so , man . You said Penny saw Bodine carrying Judy around in the pool . Forget it , man , Pace says . It 's no big thing . I should of kept my fucking trap shut . The scene is set , Jimbo says , arching his eyebrows and wrinkling his forehead . Action , man . Camera . Roll ' em . R-O-L-L , roll ' em , man . Jimbo flicks his cigarette away . He pushes erect from the cardoor and stuffs both hands into his windbreaker 's pockets . Ile shuts his eyes and squeezes the toy soldier tightly in his right hand until the dizziness passes . Got to stay in touch , he thinks and takes several unsteady steps . Fuck this , man . Just fuck this . Jimbo stops and takes a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gon na stagger-ass like a goddamn drunk nigger across this fucking parking lot , man . No way , man . No flicking way . Imagining with each heavy , self-conscious step that he is walking through some giant aquarium 's deep end , Jimbo , flanked by Pace and Boots , slouches slowly but steadilyacross the parking lot toward the Mean Green Machine . WhenJimbo reaches the edge of Bodine 's circle of flunkies Bodinelooks up at him and grins broadly . Trying to stand withoutweaving , Jimbo puts a Camel to his mouth , and after successfullystriking a match with one hand , a trick it took him twoweeks to master , he lights the cigarette 's center . Jesus Christ , Jimbo screams inside himself and tosses the burned Camel tothe pavement in disgust . In spite of himself , Jimbo glancestoward Judy 's car only to discover that she is , indeed , laughing . Like , I mean , Bodine will fuck anything that crawls , man , Bob Tweel , one of Bodine 's flunkies , says , and all Bodine 's other flunkies laugh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circle of flunkies telling Hutch Bodine stories while Bodine sits on the hood of the Mean Green Machine grinning.  |p120I  mean Bodine will fuck anything that even scoots , man , Tweel squeals . And , man , I mean the chick we picked up that night was really a dog . Really ugly . I mean ugly . So I say to Bodine , man , I would n't fuck this dog with your dick , and so Bodine says to me , man , you turn cunts upside down and they all look just the same , then Bodine says to the dog , honey , for my good deed of the month I 'm gon na mercy-fuck your brains out your ears . Well , boy , like I always say , pussy is pussy , Hutch says and laughs and all his flunkies laugh and nudge each other . Ai n't that right , Jimbo baby ? Pussy is pussy . Nudging each other and grinning like crazy , all Bodine 's flunkies turn to look at Jimbo . Jimbo arches his eyebrows and wrinkles his forehead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on this scene , to smack that shit-eating superior smirk off Hutch Bodine 's handsome , tanned , country club kisser with a devastatingly clever right-cross roundhouse reply . But he ca n't . He just ca n't think , ca n't focus . Sweat pops out on his forehead and runs in thin , cold streams from under his arms . He just ca n't think . Durnbfuck . Dumbfuck . And there is smartassHutch Bodine , big college jock , neat Princeton haircut , country club cool and summery in bright plaid bermudas and a blue boat-neck shirt , sitting so superior on the hood of his Mean Green Machine grinning at Jimbo the jerk . On this sweet , sweet summer night , Jimbo the jerk , in his scuffed motorcycle boots , his jakey jeans , his ratty red windbreaker : Jimbo the jerk , with his long hair swept back hopelessly unsummeryon the sides , swept back almost like a low-down punkboy Presley DA , hopelessly uncountry-clubby , unsummery , unbright and neat , hopelessly low-down and greasy . Greasy . Greasy is the word all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grease sliding slowly from his hairline , sliding over his sweaty forehead , sliding in thin , bluegreen , snail-track streams down his face and neck . Jimbo arches his eyebrows and wrinkles his forehead and lets his lower face collapse into a sappy grin.  |p121Yeah  ; Hutch says , my experience has been that pussy is pussy . You agree , Jimbo boy ? You read too many comic books , Jimbo says , his grin feeling sappier by the second . Hutch laughs . He drops his arm around a flunky sitting on the carhood beside him and whispers something to him . Hutch holds the middle finger of his left hand up and runs it slowly under his nose , sniffing it . Hutch laughs , then runs the finger slowly under the flunky 's nose who sniffs it loudly and rolls his eyes . Come over here , Tweel , Hutch says . Let me get another opinion on this . Tweel bops over to the car and Hutch slowly runs the finger under his nose . Oh , la la ! Tweel squeals and bops about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Yeah , I guess I 'll have to amend what I said about pussy , Hutch says , sniffing at his finger . Some pussy is sure sweeter than other pussy . Some pussy is downright finger-licking good . Yum yum . Hutch licks his finger , then runs it slowly in and out of his mouth . Right , Jimbo boy ? Hutch says . Finger-licking good . Fuck you , Bodine , Jimbo says . Hutch laughs and slides down off the carhood . Jimbo stares at Hutch 's muscular , college-fullback arms . Jimbo 's own arms feel like noodles . He tries to imagine throwing a punch at Hutch 's face . Hutch blocks the punch easily and Jimbo pictureshis noodle arm wrapping helplessly around Hutch 's thick wrist . Jimbo 's legs suddenly also feel like noodles . He grips the toy soldier in his pocket until pain shoots up his noodle arm , shoots up his neck , and spreads like a blush on his right cheek . Please , God , Jimbo thinks . Please . Please , at least do n't let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself . You want a whiff , Jimbo boy ? Hutch says as he walks slowly toward Jimbo sniffing and licking the finger . Hell , boy , you canp122even have a lick if you want it . For old time 's sake , kid . Hell , I ai n't greedy . Yum yum . Fuck you , Bodine , Jimbo says . My , my , Hutch says and stops a couple of steps in front of Jimbo . Now what kind of language is that , son ? You never did learn your lessons good , did you , boy ? You just have n't got any manners at all . When a party offers to share a sniff of the sweet stuff , son , you ought to accept . Now that 's good manners , see ? Otherwise a party might take offense . Then , boy , you might find that your ass is grass and some party is the mower , see ? F-U-C-K , fuck you , boy , Jimbo says . Well , Jimbo boy , Hutch says , laughing , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So if you take a great big whiff of this sweet stuff on my finger , and maybe even give my finger a little lick or two , or maybe just suck on the tip a bit , just the tip mind you , I might not kick the shit out of you . See ? Why not let me have a little whiff ? someone says from the edge of the gathering crowd . Everyone turns to look . The crowd parts as Frankie walks through it toward Hutch . Althoughhe is short , Frankie slouches slump shouldered , and except for his arms , more muscular even than Hutch 's , he looks almost frail . A cigarette dangles from his mouth and his heavy-lidded eyes look almost shut . He walks slowly through the parting crowd right up to Hutch and tilts his head back to gaze up into Hutch 's face through squinted eyes . Me too , Bodine ? Frankie says , almost in a whisper . He smiles and runs both hands back through blond hair almost as long as Jimbo 's . Yum yum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , smiling weakly . What 's shaking , man ? Long time , man . What 's shaking , Bodine ? What 's shaking ? Hey , gosh , I want a little sniff , Bodine , Frankie says , still smiling . I want a little sniff . Or maybe a lick , Bodine . Yum yum , Bodine . Hey , man , Hutch says , laughing faintly . We 're just fooling around , man . Oh , Frankie says . Oh . Fooling around . Oh.  |p123Yeah  ; man , Hutch says and shrugs his shoulders . Just jiving old Jimbo here , man . Oh . Just jiving old Jimbo here , Frankie says . Hey there , old Jimbo . Hey , Frankie , Jimbo says . How you doing , old Jimbo ? Frankie says . Hanging in there , Frankie . Hanging , man . Well , what 's new , old Jimbo ? Frankie says , still smiling and squinting his eyes at Hutch 's face . Not much , man , Jimbo says . I 've been drunk a lot . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you seen any good movies lately , old Jimbo ? Fuck no , Jimbo says . I been drunk a lot lately . Oh . Well , check out Thunder Road , man , Frankie says and takes the cigarette from his lips . He holds it up between his thumb and forefinger and blows lightly on its ember . It 's playing out at the StarLite Drive-In . Great flick , old Jimbo . Starring badass Robert Mitchum . And starring his kid too . Co-starring Mitchum 's real-life kid . Only , Mitchum 's real-life kid plays his kid brother in the flick . Hey , you seen that flick , Bodine ? Yeah , Frankie , Hutch says . Sure , I saw it , man . You 're right , man . Great fucking flick . Yeah , man , Tweel squeals , snapping his fingers . Great fuckingflickeroo . Please do n't do that , Frankie says quietly and squints his eyes at Tweel . Please do n't talk so loud . You do n't have to shout around all the time . Or snap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ headache , friend . Sure , Frankie , Tweel says . Sure , Frankie . Sure . Hey , Hutch , Frankie says and squints his eyes up at Hutch 's face . He smiles . You remember that wonderful , wild scene where this moonshining gangster cat is trying to run Mitchum off the road ? Remember that scene , Bodine ? Right , Hutch says . Great fucking scene , man . Yes , it was . Yes , it was a great fucking scene , Frankie says . He blows on his cigarette 's ember . And remember how oldp124badass Mitchum and the moonshining gangster cat pull up even while they 're roaring over them twisty backcountry roads smashing shit out of each other 's bombs and then old Mitchum suddenly flicks his fag through the cat 's open carwindowand it fucking hits the cat in the cheek ? Crazy , man . Fucking sparks everywhere , man . Crazy . And the cat loses control of his bomb and runs the fuck off the road and boom it blows the fuck up and the cat fries . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Yeah , man , Hutch says . Great scene . Gee , Bodine , Frankie says and winks at Hutch , why wo n't you let me sniff your finger ? I never smelled my sister 's pussy before , Bodine . Pretty please , Bodine . Hey , Frankie , Hutch says , I was just shooting the shit , man . Honest , man . Just jiving Jimbo around , man . Oh , Frankie says , smiling . Oh . Frankie flicks his glowing cigarette at Hutch 's face . Hutch flinches and the cigarette splatters against his throat in a shower of sparks and falls down the front of his boat-neck shirt . Jesus Christ , Frankie ! Hutch yells , slapping the front of his shirt like crazy and hopping around . Jesus fucking Christ , man ! Shit , man ! His hand heavy with the metal toy soldier , Jimbo swings a roundhouse right at the center of Hutch 's face . Hutch 's eyes pop cartoon wide with shock as Jimbo 's weighted fist slams into his upper lip and nose . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blood splurts . Hutch screams and tumbles crazily backward , bouncing against the Mean Green Machine . He staggers forward two steps , then falls to his knees , holding his dripping face in his hands . He slowly rolls over onto his side and draws his knees up to his chest , moaning . Staggered several steps backward by the force of the blow himself , Jimbo , dizzy , tingling , stares at the fallen Hutch in stunned disbelief . No one in the pressing crowd moves or speaks . Jimbo holds his right hand up before his eyes and looksp125it slowly over as though it is a thing not his own .. His middle three knuckles are bloody and misshapen and pushed back on his hand but he feels no pain at all . He opens his hand and examines with interest how several parts of the toy metal soldier are actually embedded in his bloody palm . Beautiful , Frankie says quietly , breaking the spell . Beautiful punch . The perfect punch . Jesus Christ ! someone in the crowd says . Goddamn ! someoneelse says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jimbo to where Hutch is lying , leans down over him , and waving a finger in the air begins to count : one two three four five six seven eight nine ten you 're out , you cocksucker ! Boots runs over to Jimbo and raises his battered right hand in the air . Winner by a fucking KO in one second of the first round ! Boots shouts . The new champ , Jimbo Stark ! Fuck that ! Tweel squeals . Stark suckerpunched him . He suckerpunched Hutch and he 's got something in his goddamn hand too ! That 's not fair , goddamn it ! No , Frankie says quietly , squinting his eyes at Tweel . But it 's over . Fuck that ! Tweel squeals . Stark suckerpunched Hutch ! Yeah , Stark suckerpunched Hutch ! another flunky yells . Yeah ! Tweel squeals . That 's not fair ! That 's chickenshit ashell . Yeah , chickenshit ! another flunky yells . Chickenshit ! others yell . Chickenshit ! Chickenshit ! You goddamn chickenshit ! Tweel yells and runs toward Jimbo . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ catches Tweel rushing in with a looping left hook to the gut . Tweel squeals and doubles over and starts staggering about grunting for breath . Anyone else want a piece of my heart ? Frankie says , smiling . Hey , man ! Jimbo says , pushing Frankie aside . This is mymovie , man ! I 'm no chickenshit , goddamn it ! I 'll fight any oneof these punk cocksuckers , goddamn it ! Come on , you punkp126cocksuckers ! Let 's rumble ! Jimbo yells and stalks toward the flunkies crowded around the fallen Hutch . Pace grabs Jimbo 's arms from behind . Come on , man , Pace says . It 's over , man'You won . Let 's get the fuck out of here , man . I 'm gon na kick ass all night ! Jimbo yells , trying to shake loose . Your buddy is right , Frankie says and steps in front of Jimbo . It 's done , kid . You ought to cut out . The fuzz are going to appear . Cut out , old Jimbo . Shit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night ! Jimbo Stark has n't even started to kick ass ! Be quiet , Frankie says to Boots . Yes , sir , Boots says . Jimbo sees Judy emerge from the crowd . Her eyes are wide and bright and she is clutching her throat . She looks at Jimbo and starts quickly toward him . Then she spots the fallen Hutch and stops dead in her tracks . She looks back and forth between the fallen Hutch and Jimbo , her mouth open wide with astonishment . Jimbo arches his eyebrows and smiles . Suddenly Judy swirls and runs to the fallen Hutch . She falls to her bare knees beside him and making sympathetic cooing sounds takes his head onto her lap . She runs her fingers through Hutch 's hair . She is wearing short shorts and her brown bare legs become smeared with Hutch 's blood . You hoodlum ! Judy cries at Jimbo , glaring at him , her eyes filling with tears . You gangster ! What ? Jimbo shouts , trying to break free from Pace 's grip . No ! That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him out of here , Frankie says to Pace , and together they muscle Jimbo backward across the parking lot . I did it for you , Judy ! Jimbo shouts . I love you , Judy ! I love you ! Just as Frankie and Pace shove Jimbo into the backseat of Pace 's Ford the fuzz arrive , the black and white patrol car swinging into the parking lot with red bubble flashing . Can you handle him ? Frankie asks Pace.  |p127No  sweat , Pace says and hops into the frontseat . Wait for me , man , Boots calls , running up to the car . Vanish , punk , Frankie tells Boots . Yes , sir , Boots says and walks quickly away . Firing up a cigarette , Frankie strolls slowly across the lot to here the Silver Ghost is parked . You stay the fuck down in the fucking seat , champ , Pacesays to Jimbo and starts up the engine quietly , with no revving , no muffler popping . Pace drives off the parking lot slowly . So where to , champ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She did me dirt . Come on , champ , where to ? Pace says . Home , man ? Home ? Home ? Are you shitting me , man ? Jimbo says . I do n't have a home . I do n't have shit , man . Jesus Christ ! Pace says and shifts into low , peeling out . Do n't start blubbering on me , man . Come on , Jimbo , where to ? Boomer 's , Jimbo says . Where 's Boomer at , man ? Out at his summer camp ? Yeah , Jimbo says . Hey , Pace , do me one last favor . Name it , champ . The big envelope I brought with me tonight . Give it to Judy for me , man . Tell her she can do anything she wants with it . Tell her I dropped her ring in it and that she can do anything she wants with it too . And tell her I loved her . Sure , champ . Sure.  |p128The  old cemetery at the edge of town had not been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Boomer 's father and the richest mortician in town , had closed it and incorporatedthe rolling slopes of several farms south of town into burial lots whose reasonable rates marked them from the beginning as good investments . The old cemetery was mostly overgrown now , with many toppled tombstones and sunken graves . The old , one-story stone caretaker 's house , its front rooms gutted by fire years earlier , stood at the top of steep , narrow stone steps that wound up around the hill at the town-side edge of the old cemetery . Each year at the first sign of warm weather Boomer would move from his small apartmentabove the mortuary to the back unburned rooms of this old caretaker 's house for the summer . The old stone house was cool inside and private and the overgrown graveyard had almost returned to forest . It made a dandy summer camp , Boomer always explained . And every red-blooded American boy ought to get to go off to summer camp . Jimbo watches Pace peel out in the spraying roadside gravel . He watches the Ford @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and begins stumbling up the steep stairs . Panting , he sits down on the top step and awkwardly with his left hand fires up a cigarette . His right hand is swollen nowp129and aching . With his left hand 's fingertips he lightly brushes the smashed knuckles and winces at the shooting pain . Oh Jesus , he says aloud and blows on the knuckles . He takes the sock out of his windbreaker 's pocket and carefully slips it over the battered hand . The old soldier tends his bloody war wounds , Jimbo thinks and smiles . The perfect punch . Jimbo cradles the hand close to his chest and gazes out over the lights of the town and the headlights and taillights of the cars coming and going across the new bridge to Ohio . The old bridge , a half-mile south and closed for years , is dark except for small , red , blinking lights scattered about its piers to warn riverboats . He could buy that old bridge for a lousy buck . That was the rumor anyway . You could buy the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to tear it down yourself and apparently the salvage was not supposed to be enough to make it pay . But for a lousy buck . A whole goddamn bridge for your own . He ought to buy the sucker and refuse to tear it down . Buy it and live on it . Live right in the middle of it . Like the mean old troll , Jimbo thinks , looking at the blood spots spreading on the sock . No one fucks with mean old trolls . Wind rises up in the trees behind him and Jimbo looks back over his shoulder . Summer rainclouds have covered the earlier clear sky and the old caretaker 's house is just a large shadow higher on the hill . Here and there on the hillside among the trees Jimbo can see the dark shapes of tombstones . He shivers . He used to run through these tombstones at night when he was a squirt : run with his pals playing insane spook , hooting and screeching and sometimes toppling over tombstones . And there was that one Halloween night when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people 's porches : small stones with little lambs perched on their tops or carved on their surfaces . For a long time after that Halloween night Jimbo had had horrible dreams of rotting babies rising from their graves for revenge , their little bald heads pushing up out of the earth like mushroom caps after a rain : dreams of rotting babies dragging him screaming and kicking back to be buried with them in the old cemetery . Jimbo shivers again and stands up.  |p130The  old cemetery , he thinks , looking around the dark , silent hillside . The last , the ultimate boondocks . The boondocks of death . For a moment Jimbo thinks of running down the stone stairs like a bat out of hell . Jesus , he thinks . I need another goddamn drink , Jimbo says aloud and laughs . The shades are drawn in the windows of the back room Boomer uses but Jimbo can see a dim glow of light behind them and he hears low music coming from inside . Jimbo walks across the small back porch and raps lightly on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to boo like a ghost . For years the town squirts have been deliciously titillating their terror by skulking around the old haunted caretaker 's house at night . Jimbo smiles . He can remember running crazily down the hill as a squirt himself , pop-eyed with delightful fear . Oh 00000000000000h 0000000000000h , the haunter moans . B000000 b00000000000 , the haunter boos . M00000000000o m00000000000 , yourself , Jimbo moos . Hey , squirt , come on in , Boomer calls , in his deep , froggy voice . Boomer is sitting at the old kitchen table in the center of the small room . The only light in the room is from a portable teevee sitting on a chair in one corner . The teevee 's sound is turned off and the music , a country tune , is coming from an old Silvertone radio placed on top of the teevee set . Get yourself a brew , squirt , Boomer says . Thanks , Jimbo says and gets a beer out of the refrigerator , then pulls a chair up to the table across from Boomer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get around to saying bye-bye to your poor old Uncle Boomer , Boomer says , the cigarette dangling from the corner of his mouth jerking little perfect clouds as he talks . He pushes his old , battered gray fedora even farther back on his head with a thumb , then carefully fills the shot glass on the table in front of him to its brim from a quart bottle of bourbon . He refills a half-full water glass with beer ,  |p131then  freely sprinkles its top from a large-sized circular Morton'sSalt container . I 've been saying a lot of bye-byes tonight , Jimbo says , staring a t the sinking salt crystals as they dissolve in effervescent bubbles in Boomer 's beer . Jimbo takes a long pull from his own bottle of beer . What time does your bus depart tomorrow , squirt ? Fuck the bus . Now that could n't be a great deal of fun . That 's sure a cute glove you 're wearing there , squirt . That 's my sidekick Plato , Jimbo says , laying his sock-covered bloody hand out on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So I see . War wounds , Jimbo says . With his left forefinger and thumb he picks at the blood-soaked sock . I kicked shit out of Hutch Bodine tonight . That was a bye-bye I wish you could have seen . Not me , squirt . The sight of blood makes me burp . But congratulations anyway , Boomer says . He drinks half the bourbon from the shot glass , chases it with half the beer from the water glass , then carefully refills them both . What a goddamn mess . I 'm only seventeen and already everything 's broken down , Jimbo says , shaking his head . He holds the nearly empty bottle up before him and rotates it slowly , watching the small image of the teevee move like a tiny moon over the curved dark surface of the glass . Across the room , on floor-to-ceiling shelves , glass jars reflect hundreds of tiny teevee screens : rows upon rows of glass jars full of dead little creatures floating in alcohol . And they were only a small selection of Boomer 's Grand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steadily for years . Eyes , Jimbo suddenly thinks . The tiny teevee screens reflected in the glass jars are like hundreds of eyes : bright , unblinking , busy little eyes , as though all the little creatures in the jars are suddenly alive and staring at him . Jimbo reaches for Boomer 's quart bottle of bourbon.  |p132I  'm going to miss you , you old weird duck , Jimbo says . You 're about the only friend I have . You and old Pace . Well , I suppose I 'll miss you too , squirt . You 're about the only witness I have . An old weird duck needs a young weird duck around for a witness . Dig it , Jimbo says and takes a drink . Listen , squirt , Boomer says , as rain suddenly gusts against the windows . Sounds like a nice night out . For spooks and weird ducks anyway . Dig it , Jimbo says . He picks up the Morton 's Salt container and studies the little blond girl with the umbrella who spills salt behind her as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it pours , Jimbo reads . He pours a small mound of salt out on the tabletop . Profound , Boomer says . Profound . Fuck , man , Jimbo says . He puts his head on the table . I 'm only seventeen and everything is already fucked up . Now , now , squirt , do n't get my tabletop all teary , Boomer says . He drains the shot glass . He puts the empty quart bourbonbottle in the middle of the table . One more dead soldier , squirt , Boomer says . Maybe our last dead soldier together for a spell . Yeah , I guess so , Jimbo says . He holds the empty bourbon bottle up in the light and shakes it , then puts it back on the table . He takes the toy metal soldier from his windbreaker 's pocket and places it beside the empty bottle . Now , here 's your basic dead soldier , Boomer . What do you think of this basic dead soldier , Boomer ? Boomer picks it up and turns it around slowly in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ red , silvertrimmeduniform , its silver , high-pointed , plumed helmet . When Boomer puts the toy soldier back on the table beside the bottle Jimbo picks it up and begins marching it around the tabletop . Forward , march , Jimbo says . Your left , your right , your left , your right , your left . Marches pretty good for an unknown soldier , right , Boomer ? Pretty goddamn good . Hup , hup , hup.  |p133Not  bad at all , Boomer says . Marching the fuck over hill and hup hup dale , Jimbo says and marches the toy soldier through the small mound of salt . Marching , marching , marching bravely through the goddamn snowy dead of winter . Marching the fuck all over the goddamnsnowy Second World War 's dead of winter . Leftfucking-face . Right-fucking-face . About-fucking-face . Right-fucking-face , Boomer says . He begins marching the empty bourbon bottle about the tabletop too . You 're in the goddamn army now ! Jimbo yells and jumps up from the table , knocking his chair over . You 're in the goddamn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lungs and begins to stomp around the table . You 'll never get rich , you son of a bitch , you 're in the army now ! You 're in the army now ! Boomer croaks , pounding the bottle on the table . You 're in the army now ! Onward Christian soldiers ! Onward Christian soldiers ! Jimbo sings , stomping and waving his bloody , sock-covered hand in the air . Onward as to war ! With the cross of Jesus going on before ! The cross of Jesus ! Boomer croaks and pounds the table . Jimbo flops down onto Boomer 's cot near the door and lies there laughing . Finally , catching his breath , he just lies there listening to the rain and staring up at the strange shadows the teevee light flickers over the ceiling . Coughing , Boomer gets up slowly and walks unsteadily over to an old chest of drawers against the wall opposite the door . From its top drawer he takes an unopened quart bottle of bourbon . Back sitting at the table , still coughing , Boomer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cocksucker is the one , Jimbo says . He 's the one who taught me to march . Drilled my ass off . Left-fucking-face . Right-fucking-face . About-fucking-face . Jimbo swings his legs over the cot 's side and sits there holding his face in his hands . He 's the one I should have given the big good-bye to . The cocksucker . The big good-bye in the sky . Banished his ass to the big boondocks in the sky . He 's thep134one I should have drilled with the perfect punch , Jimbo says , standing up wearily . He picks up his knocked-over chair and sits down at the table . He stretches his bloody , sock-covered hand out on the tabletop . Rat-a-tat-tat-tat-tat , Jimbo says and flicks the toy soldier 's face with Plato 's stiff upper lip , knocking it over . He picks up the Morton 's container and slowly covers the fallen toy soldier with salt . Dead as a doornail , Jimbo says . The unknown cocksucker . Amen . Do n't get salt in your wounds , squirt , Boomer says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Amen , squirt , Boomer says . How could you love him ? Jimbo asks . How could you ever love him ? It was supposed to be the grandest Fourth of July celebrationthe town had ever witnessed . The mayor at that time , who happened to be Boomer 's father , spent months planning the whole shebang . Planned a grand parade . Grand patriotic floats . Every highschool band in the county . A crack army reserve drill team . The parade paraded all over town . It did not miss a main street . Boomer 's father was its grand marshal and , carrying an American flag , he marched out in front of the grand parade all over town . The parade ended up on the old bridge late in the afternoon where they were going to shoot off the grandest fireworks show of all time . But first the crack army reserve drill team was to shoot off a grand twenty-onegunsalute from the center of the bridge . I can still see all those shiny spent shells bouncing all over the bridge in the late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up a whole pocketful . I pretended they were some kind of strange coins . Exotic coins from China . I can remember wondering how high those bullets would rise before they arched and started back down . I remember wondering if the fish would be able to dodge them when those bullets hit the river.  |p135Another  grand attraction was also planned before the grand fireworks show . My dear old departed dad had in a moment of sublime inspiration hired a certain Chief Soaring Eagle to perform a thrilling stunt to really give the folks something to remember . Old Chief Soaring Eagle was a part-time wrestler and circus daredevil quite famous in that day . He claimed to be a bona fide Aztec Indian war chief , although there were a few dastardly rumors to the contrary . Dastardly rumors that Chief was actually a wop from Dayton , Ohio . At any rate , my dear old departed dad hired the great Chief to dive off the bridge into the dangerous river far below . His splashing entrance into the dangerous current was to signal the first flares of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eagle looked magnificent , his eagle-feather headdress gleaming in that late afternoon sunlight . And when with great solemnity he removed his beaded and brightly feathered ceremonial chieftain 's cape there was no doubt in my squirt mind . That beautiful , brown , sleekly muscled body was no Dayton , Ohio , wop 's body . He was truly an Aztec war chief . An Aztec god . You have to picture this , squirt . Chief Soaring Eagle carefullyremoves his cape and headdress and with grave dignity prepares to daredevil dive into the dangerous river far below . Barefoot , he balances on the narrow railing , his head tilted back as though in worship , his long , black , gleaming hair falling straight back almost to his waist , sunlight golden on his calm , brave face . The highschool bands ' drums roll . My dear old departed dad , resplendent in his World War One infantry captain 's uniform , stands ready to fire the first rocket personally . The crack army reserve drill team is poised to fire a final volley . Slowly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Suddenly , bursting through the crowd , yelping and hooting like a movie redskin devil savage , your dad , the captain of all the squirts , jumps up on the railing beside Chief Soaring Eagle . Your dad is bareback and his body and face are streaked with bright red and yellow paint and he is wearing a bandanna with several old bent chicken feathers stuck in it . Listen , squirt . Old Chief Soaring Eagle looked downp136at that painted , feathered , yelping dad of yours with an expression of such bug-eyed , open-mouth , goofy astonishment as I 've never again seen on another human face . The crowd gasped . The drums stopped rolling . My dear old departed dad squealed . Your dad laughed and jumped . Then suddenly I was jumping too . And damn if I know why . I do n't even remember thinking about it . Just suddenly I was watching the river rise up to greet me . I do n't remember being afraid or anything . Actually , I think I was rather calm about the whole thing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jumping into the river behind your dad . And , although I do n't remember really thinking about anything in particular , I do remember how it all seemed so slow , like everything was happening in slow motion , and I remember how clear all my impressions were , how clearly I was seeing things , small things like branches floating along in the current . I remember seeing your dad below me in the water and I remember giggling when I saw the amazed look on his face when he spotted me . There I was giggling and I was probably going to drown . Probably going to take the big drink . Hell , I could hardly swim . I do n't remember hitting the water at all . And I do n't remember your dad pulling my ass out of the drink . But he did . He saved me . He pulled my ass out of the big drink . And you know , squirt , that wop from Dayton , Ohio , refused to dive after that . Old Cap always protected me . Always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big brother . I was under his wing . And for no reason at all . I was always the puny squirt of squirts and old Cap was always the captain of squirts . I was nothing and he always took up for my worthless ass . And besides that time he pulled me out of the big drink there was another occasion when you might say he saved my worthless ass . You mean he saved your life another time ? You might say that . When was it ? What happened ? I was so drunk I can hardly remember it.  |p137Come  on , Boomer . Tell me . Forget it , squirt . Come on , Boomer . How did he save you ? He did n't shoot me . What ? He did n't what ? He did n't shoot me . He did n't shoot you ? When ? What happened ? Forget it , squirt . Fuck , Boomer ! Come on . Goddamn it , squirt ! I said forget it . Sure , Boomer . Sure . Pass the goddamn bottle . Sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You want to camp out here tonight , squirt ? I 'll get out the other cot . No . Come on . Why do n't you stay here tonight ? No , Jimbo says . He picks the toy soldier up out of the mound of salt and puts it in his windbreaker 's pocket . No . I got things to do . You 're welcome to stay . But suit yourself . I got places to go , Jimbo says and gets up . He walks slowly over to the door and opens it . Rain sweeps in . I need a big drink . That 's what I - eed . Plenty to drink here . That 's not the kind of big drink I need , Jimbo says , arching his eyebrows and wrinkling his forehead . Now , now , squirt , do n't get melodramatic . Do n't sweat it , Boomer . Well , what can I tell you ? Boomer says and tilts back in his chair . He blows a series of perfect smoke rings into the air . Wish I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought . Do n't sweat it , Boomer . Well , do n't do anything I would n't do . Do n't take any wooden nickels . Do n't piss against the wind . Life is no bed of roses . By the yard life is hard , by the inch it 's a cinch . Neverp138use sobriety as a crutch . Behind every dark cloud there 's a silver lining . Hitch your wagon to a star . A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush . The truth is always leaked . The highest motive is to be like water . Never go to reality stag . The good traveler leaves no tracks . Thanks for the tips , Uncle . You 're welcome , squirt , Boomer says and smiles . The smoky air about his shadowed skullface is luminous in the flickering teevee light . Catch you , Boomer , Jimbo says and walks into the rain . On bare feet Jimbo balances himself carefully on the railing in the center of the old bridge . The rain is cold now and comes in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he can taste rain in the corners of his mouth . He can hear the rushing dark river far below and he thinks about how terribly cold its water must be . His clothes are soaked and he shivers in the cold , rising river air . Farther up the river , lights from the new bridge shudder on the swift , dark current . For a time Jimbo watches the lights of the cars crossing the new bridge . Jimbo closes his eyes and tilts back his head . The big drink , Jimbo thinks and smiles . Jimbo tries to imagine hitting that dark , cold water . How cold would the water be on the bottom ? he wonders . Would he be able to see at all underwater in the dark ? How long would he be able to hold his breath ? He could hold his breath underwater longer than anyone he ever knew . He had always hated to swim on the surface , but he liked to swim underwater , to swim close to the bottom for as long as he could hold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fish , Captain always said . The cocksucker . Jimbo would not even try to swim when he hit that cold water . He would not even try to swim underwater , and he would not hold his breath . He would practice his deadman 's float , that 's what he would do . And it might be days before they found him floating on his face far downriver . And by that time his body would be horribly bloated and fish would have eaten out his eyes . We found him practicing hisp139deadman 's float , the cops would explain when they brought Captain andJudy to identify his corpse . But he could swim like a fish , Captain would tell them . I taught him to swim like a fish myself . You can swim like a fish , soldierboy , I told him . Just jump in and swim to me , son . I 'm right here , soldierboy . Jump , son . Jump . Jump . Jump . Jump , damn it ! Jimbo curls his bare toes over the railing 's edge . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Jump ! Jump ! Jump , goddamn it ! Jimbo slowly raises his arms above his head and stands on tiptoe . Jimbowants more than anything to be with Captain in the deep end . Jump ! Jump ! Jump , goddamn it ! You 're not going to drown , goddamn it ! Captain shouts and slaps the water with a cupped hand . It sounds like a shot . Jimbo flinches . Jimbo falls . He breaks his fall back onto the bridge with his battered , bloody hand . He screams and rolls over . He can feel the metal soldier in his windbreaker 's pocket stab painfully into his side . Oh Jesus oh Jesus oh Jesus , Jimbo cries and curls childlike about his bloody hand . Oh Jesus oh Jesus oh please Jesus oh please Jesus oh please Jesus . When he comes to , Jimbo rolls slowly over onto his back . Jesus , he thinks . He holds his bloody hand up close before his eyes , trying to see it in the dark . Jesus , he thinks and rests his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , letting the cold rain hit the back of his throat . Wonder how long it would take , Jimbo thinks , letting rain puddle in his open mouth . To drown in the rain . Jimbo sits up and for a moment feels faint again . He shakes his head to clear it . He feels around in the darkness until he finds his motorcycle boots . Jimbo throws away his wet socks and after emptying the rain from the boots he slowly and with great difficulty pulls them on with his left hand . He feels dizzy again and lies back down until it passes . When he sits up he carefully peels the blood-soaked sock off his hand . He tries to examine his hand in the darkness . He blows on the hand and then , gently , he kisses the smashed knuckles . He kisses them and softly licks them . The blood is still sticky in places and tastes salty . Jimbo holds the hand up and slowly turns itp140around and around in the rain . He tilts his head back and catches rain again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again the salt taste is gone . Jimbo reaches across himself with his left hand and tenderly touches his aching right side . He takes the toy soldier out of his windbreaker 's pocket and holds it up in the dark before his face . It seems to be bent but he ca n't be certain . Thanks a lot , cocksucker , Jimbo says aloud and tries to laugh . Well , Jimbo thinks , I guess I blew this burg all right . Look the fuck out , boondocks , ' cause old Captain Rebel Without a Cause is on his way . Jimbo picks up the bloody sock and stuffs the toy soldier into it . Consider yourself one drowned cat , cocksucker , Jimbo says . He tosses the sock and toy soldier far out into the darkness over the river.  |p143zoom  in on Jimbo Starlc refusing to remember . Jimbo Stark , one week after his highschool graduation , roaring through a rainy southern night , warm can of beer between his legs , window down , radio on , his steely eyes on the shiny , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seat beside him : Jimbo Stark making the perfect clean getaway at last and refusing to remember : refusing to remember slouching across the auditoriumstage at his honorless highschool graduation ceremonyafter his hopeless year of boondocks banishment : refusing to give a shit that Captain was not there ; refusing to remember falling down drunk again and again as he tried to bop at graduation parties , to remember stealing money from girls ' purses after coming to on a bed of coats , to remember bouncing shirtless about the highschool 's parking lot barking fight challenges to all corners , then losing quickly to a freshman football star in the dazzling headlights of circled cars . . . closeupof Jimbo Stark 's face , the tight , ironic grin , the steely eyes searching the roadside unafraid in the flashing headlights for ghost hitchhikers , headless truck drivers seeking their smashed , long-rusted rigs : ghostgirls in prom dress shrouds still trying to return home safely to Mother after that fatalp144crash twenty years ago : Jimbo Stark 's steely eyes sweep the haunted roadside and he refuses to remember the press @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picnic only days earlier when they had held each other in swimsuits under a tree during that sudden summer rain and she had told him tearfullythat this time it was real , this time she was pregnant for real . Jimbo Stark takes a sip of warm beer and listens to the tires purr on the wet pavement and refuses to remember his mother 's quick , burning eyes , her face shining in the bright revival tent lights , as she slowly unbuttoned her blouse .. . Jimbo Stark grins and fires up a Camel . He arches his eyebrows and wrinkles his forehead and refuses to remember . Jimbo Stark , who is going to live his life like holy lightning , who is going to be a holy mad one , mad to live , mad to be saved : Jimbo Stark , old Captain Rebel Without a Cause On the Road , steely eyed , grinning tightly , his soul whoopeeing , roars relentlessly through the rainy southern night as he makes the perfect clean getaway in the stolen Silver Ghost . The gas tank was nearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Silver Ghost off the highway onto a narrow blacktop road which he followed for a mile before pulling over under some trees by a small stream . He gave Pace 's shoulder a perfunctory punch . Pace grunted and tried to curl into a smaller ball on the bucketseat.Jimbo fired up a Camel and for a time sat there smoking and listening to an all-night hillbilly music station . He had always thought he hated hillbilly music , associating it with those school bus country hicks everyone Cool made fun of . Right now he felt differently . Right now those sad songs of faded love hit the spot . After a time the windshield covered with steam and Jimbo rolled down his window . He could see his breath in the cool morning air . He got out of the Silver Ghost and stretched in the warm sunlight . He walked slowly down to the small stream and took a leisurely leak into its shallow current . In the glistening morning light small spiderwebs sparkled from the damp grass along the bank . A hillside meadow on the far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and small blue flowers and Jimbo could see grasshoppers flicking through the high grass . Birds called and thrashed in the thick leaves of the trees around him . Jimbo zipped up his fly and then shut . his eyes and just stood there on the bank feeling the warm sunlight on his face . It all starts right here , he thought . Right here . I ca n't believe this shit , Pace said from the car . What 's the matter , amigo ? Jimbo said and walked back to the car . I 'm so fucked up , man , Pace said . He had his cardoor open and was sitting bent far over , his feet flat on the ground , his face in his hands . I 'm sick as shit , man . This is the one that kills me . Oh Jesus . Where the fuck are we anyway ? I 'm not sure , Jimbo said and offered Pace a drag on his Camel . Somewhere in Virginia I guess . Or maybe North Carolina . Why did you pull over , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handed the Camel back to Jimbo . It 's daylight and we 're about out of petrol , partner . Well , why in the fuck did you stop here , man ? Pace asked , looking around . Jesus , this ai n't a gas station . We 're in the middle of the goddamn woods , man . Woods , man . Wolves . Fucking bears . You do n't know much about getaways , do you ? You do n't wheel a stolen getaway car into a gas station in broad daylight , man . Not a stolen getaway car like the Silver Ghost anyway . Partner , this is where we part company with the old Silver Ghost . We ditch it right here . Oh , that 's cute . Then what ? Do we walk to fucking Florida ? Pace said . He adjusted the mirror on the door and after studying his face for a moment began to methodically pop pimples . You do n't really think your hero would make you walk all the way to Florida , do you ? We fly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the open road , Jimbo said and wiggled his thumbs winglike in Pace 's face.  |p146Oh  , what in the holy shit am I doing here ? Pace said and jumped out of the car . You really did it to me this time , Stark . What the fuck am I doing here ? Why did I ever let you talk me into this shit ? Now , now , little amigo , Jimbo said . He hopped up on the right front fender . Where 's that old spirit of adventure ? We 're soldiers of fortune , amigo . Soldiers of fortune do n't whine around . You ca n't waste your time bellyaching when you 're on the road in search of adventure . And you remember what I told you soldiers of fortune get plenty of , do n't you ? Tell me again , Pace said . Convince me . Pussy , Jimbo said . Soldiers of fortune get more pussy than they know what to do with . And amigo , I mean exotic pussy . Beautiful , exotic princess pussy . I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his hands and moaned . I ca n't believe it . A week ago I had a beautiful bomb and a honey who loved me . Then you hit town . I get drunk . I wreck my bomb . My old man raises hell . I get drunker . I lose my honey . I get drunker . My old man kicks my ass . You ruined my life , Stark . Now , now , little amigo , Jimbo said . Baggage . That 's all baggage . You got to travel light to be a soldier of fortune on the road . Baggage just slows you down . And you leave tracks . The good traveler leaves no tracks . Oh Jesus Christ , Stark ! You and your goddamn beatnik babble , Pace said . He walked down to the stream , then stood there on the bank weaving and shivering while he groped with stiff fingers about his fly . I 'm so fucking cold I ca n't even find my goddamn pecker . I think it froze and fell the hell off . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fender and began to bounce about on the balls of his feet flicking punches . Just think about exotic princess pussy . You 'll find it soon enough , amigo . Quackshit , Pace said . Jimbo stopped shadowboxing and just stood there inhaling deeply . Whooee ! Whooee , world ! he yelled and pounded his chest.  |p147Whooee  my quack ass , Pace said and pissed a thin , quaveringarc out into the water . A week ago I had a beautiful bomb and a girl who loved me and my whole life was planned out . College next fall . Then after college Penny and I would get hitched and I 'd go on to law school . Then after law school we 'd have a kid and I 'd be a hotshit lawyer raking in the dough . My old man has been a cop for seventeen years and all he ever wanted was for me to grow up to be a hotshit lawyer . He 's been saving for my college for years . And here I 've been out of highschool less than two weeks and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A car thief Thanks to you , Stark . Thanks to you . What a bunch of crap , Jimbo said , firing up another Camel . None of that chickenshit crap means a thing , man . Do n't you understand ? We are on the road . Let me tell you something , amigo . Right now  --  right this very minute while we 're standinghere  --  an old man with flowing white hair and wide , knowing eyes is waiting patiently out there somewhere on the road for us to find him . He is waiting patiently for us with the Word . The Word , amigo . The Word . When we find him he will give us the Word and make us silent . Oh Jesus fucking Christ , Stark ! Give me a break . You and your goddamn beatnik crap . Give me a break , man ! Amen , amigo . Jim , let 's go back . Seriously . Fuck that , man . Seriously . Let 's just get in the car and go back home . It 's not too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's always been too late . Quackshit , man . Listen , Jimbo . It was a joyride , man . We just got drunk and took a crazy joyride . Things just got out of hand , that 's all . We 'll tell them that . They 'll understand . Hell , even Frankie will understand that . Frankie has done a lot of crazy things himself before . And Frankie likes you , man . I bet old Frankie will just laugh it off . I 'm not sweating old Frankie , pal . I want to go back , Jimbo . I want to get Penny back . I wantp148to fix up my bomb . I want to be a hotshit lawyer and rake in the dough when I grow up . Suit yourself . Go back if you want to . I 'm not holding you down or anything . What about Judy , man ? She does n't exist . Hey , Jim , that 's not being fair . Just because of one dumb mistake . There is no Judy . I should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have told you if it had been the other way around . Shit , man . Come on . Let 's go back . Like I said , suit yourself . I ai n't stopping you . But I 'm not going back . Ever . I 'm on the road for good , man . Splitsville , daddy . Forever . This was no punk joyride for me . This was a clean getaway . Using both hands , Jimbo picked up a large , egg-shaped rock from beside the road . Hey , Jim , Pace said . Come on . I 'll tell you one thing , though , partner , Jimbo said and hoisted the rock up to his chest . If you go back you 'll have to walk . Hey , Jim . Come on , man . Just cool it . I 'll cool it all right , Jimbo said . As though shooting a set shot , Jimbo pushed the rock into the air . The center of the Silver Ghost 's windshield , tinted green with reflected leaves and shivering like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into it . Jesus fucking Christ ! Pace yelled and jumped backward . You 're fucking crazy ! You 're insane ! Amen , Jimbo said . He walked over to the Silver Ghost . He ran his hands slowly over the warm metal of the hood . Well , that 's that , he thought . He leaned over and peered into the hole in the windshield . The black leather bucketseats were covered with shining , broken glass . Jimbo suddenly felt dizzy , almost sick , and he shut his eyes . I just ca n't fucking believe it , Pace said.  |p149Dig  it , Jimbo said . Now what in the fuck can we tell them ? Pace asked . How can we explain that ? Jesus . Who care  --  imbo said . Tell them you got hit by a goddamn meteorite . Tell them you were just cruising the Silver Ghost along on a joyride minding your own goddamn business when all of a sudden out of the blue you got drilled by a falling star . Tell them the fucking sky is falling . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , I 'll catch you around , amigo , Jimbo said . He took his small suitcase out of the Silver Ghost . I 'll drop you a postcard from never-never land . Jesus , Pace said , just standing there staring at the Silver Ghost . He shook his head . Jimbo walked slowly up the blacktop road toward the highway . He could hear distant traffic . Oh , fuck it anyway , Pace said . Hold up , Kemosabe . What ? Jimbo said and turned around . Wait a goddamn minute , will you ? Let me get my goddamn transistor radio out of the goddamn car . It 's my old man 's graduation gift . I do n't want to leave it . Dig it , Jimbo said , grinning . Jesus Christ , Pace said as he trotted up to Jimbo . Have a little breakfast , Jimbo said . He handed Pace a pint of bourbon he took from his suitcase . I still ca n't believe this shit , Pace said and took a long pull . Hey , partner , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they walked toward the highway . Things are going to be cool . Take your hero 's word for it , boy . First we 'll get a little truck driver cafe grub in our soldier of fortune guts . Then we 'll fly south on the swift wings of the road . Hey , amigo , things will be cool . It 's going to be a piece of cake . Listen , Miami is hopping this time of year . It 's tourist season , amigo . They 'll be begging for busboys and bellhops . You know , we might even get on as lifeguards . Like at one of those big fancy hotels . We 'll have room and board in one of thosep150fancy hotels and plenty of dough in our pockets . That 'll give us plenty of time to look around for something really interesting . Like on a boat or something . A sunken treasure expedition . Some smuggling . Adventure . Adventure . Just keep picturing a beautiful , exotic princess sitting on your face . I could use some breakfast , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jacket up in back and pushed up its sleeves to his elbows . He clicked on his red transistor radio . Listen , Jimbo said , just remember what old Alfred E. Newmanalways says . What 's that , man ? What , me worry ? Jimbo quacked in his Donald Duck cartoonvoice . Quackshit , Pace said . Quackshit . Jimbo shaded his eyes with his hands and gazed down the narrow , two-lane blacktop road . In the distance the hot blacktop looked strangely wet , as if covered with pools of shining , dark water . Not a car in sight . In either direction . The road was a secondary route back road which Jimbo had figured would be safer for their getaway , safer than the main highway from sleepy-eyed , slowly patrolling , southern deputy sheriffs with time on their hands to stop and ask questions  --  Hey , boy , ai n't I seen a poster out on you ? Hey , ai n't you Jimbo Stark ? Christ ! Pull your rod , Clyde , it 's the Jimbo Stark gang ? but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearly two hours . Sun blazing in a cloudless sky : flat , hot fields spreading to horizons : the air , hot , still , smellingof steaming cow dung : a single wretched-looking crow perched on a nearby speed limit sign evil-eyeing them like potential crowlunch . Pace was doing a little dance in the roadside 's dust while holding his red transistor radio tightly to his ear . Alley Qop Oop , the radio played and at each Oop Pace snapped his fingers and grunted and Jimbo flinched . The bottoms of Pace 's pegged jeans and his black penny loafers were powdered palep151with the dust he stirred . Jesus , Jimbo thought and coughed in the rising dust . Some gang . Some getaway . Do you have to kick up all that goddamn dust ? Jimbo said . He was squatting in the feeble shade of a dust-covered bush beside the road . Gee , Kemosabe , I 'm so sorry , Pace said and continued dancing . I 'm just having so much fun at this adventure I 've got me an uncontrollable case of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man , with you flitting around like a goddamn fag . Tra la la , Pace said , dancing on tiptoe . Oh , tra la la . Why me , God ? Jimbo said and spat into the road . Hey , hero , Pace said and looked intently at his watch . It 's almost two o'clock , man . We ai n't had a lift in a long time . Stuck in the middle of nowhere . Hungry . Hot . Hung over . Hey , man , this adventuring is a real kick . Glad you dig it . Hey , Kemosabe , let me ask you a question . Have we had an adventure yet , man ? I mean , you 'd be sure to tell me if we were having an adventure , right ? I 'd hate like hell to miss out on adventure . I 'll tell you all right , turdface . Some sturdy sidekick you are . Yeah ? Well , some hero you are . Turdface . Asshole . Turdface , Jimbo said . He hit the nearby speed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flapped to a fencepost across the road from where he resumed his glare . I guess the turdface has a point all right , Jimbo thought . Some adventure . Some getaway . Maybe he should not have ditched the Silver Ghost after all . Maybe he should have driven it to the end . Maybe he should have pulled the Silver Ghost out into that stream and floated off on it . Made a raft out of the old Silver Ghost and he and Pace could have perhaps floated it safely all the way down the Mississippi to New Orleans . Now , that would have been some getaway . No , Jimbo thought . Hep152was right about ditching it . The old Silver Ghost , Jimbo thought , suddenly picturing its smashed windshield . He wished with all of his heart he could take that back . Frankie did n't deserve that . Frankie did n't deserve any of this shit . Frankie had always done right by Jimbo . He had even gotten Jimbo and Judy back together last summer . Frankie had told Judy what Hutch Bodine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ punch at the Beacon that night . And after Pace had given her the ring and poems Judy had called Jirnbo at his grandmother 's in the boondocks . I feel so awful , she had wept . So guilty . They had begun writing daily and calling weekly then and Jimbo was certain their love was more true than ever . He was certain this time their love would grow and grow until the end of time , until the twelfth of never . Well , the old laugh had been on him once again . But never again , Jimbo thought and spit into the road . The old laugh would never be on him again . Jimbo would never again believe in truelove . A car appeared in the shimmering watery distance of the road and Jimbo jumped up . He brushed off the back of his pants . He carefully took his glasses out of his shirt pocket and put them on . Glasses , amigo , Jimbo said . Glasses are the trick . Makes you look smart . Sincere . Safe . Makes you look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like it , Pace said . Christ , Pace , why do you have to wear that highschool hoodlum jacket all the time ? Even in this heat . At least put the collar down . Try to look like a nice college boy . Not a goddamnpunk highschool hood . Bang bang bang , asshoje , Pace said , hiking his leg high and farting loudly . Just as the car approached , Jimbo smiled broadly and waved his thumb and hoped he could fasten his sincere eyes onto the driver 's . The car , a 1956 red and black Ford Victoria with jeweled white mud flaps and several squirrel tails tied to its aerial , was packed with teenage girls who yelled and waved furiously as they roared past . Jimbo flipped them the finger.  |p153The  air inside the drugstore was cool and had a fresh icecream smell to it . Jimbo and Pace walked to the fountain area in back and sat on stools . Pace immediately began to spin himself around and around on his stool while trying to imitate the buzz of a helicopter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his usual three hotdogs with everything and a large double cherry Coke . Do n't you ever eat anything else ? Jimbo said . Not if I can help it , Pace said . I got to think about my figure . Christ , Jimbo said and laughed . Listen , partner , how much money do you have left anyway ? We better do some accounting . Not much , man , Pace said and took out his wallet . About six bucks and some change is all . God , Pace , where the fuck is all your graduation loot ? In the bank , man . My old man made me put it there for college next year . For college ? Jesus . Well , I ai n't got no rich Uncle Boomer , man . I ai n't got it made in the shade . Made in the shade . Sure thing . I 'm not going to any fucking college myself , man . The road of life is going to be old Captain Rebel Without a Cause 's college . That 's just peachy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ degree in bumism . I 'm going to be a lawyer myself , daddy . Make the bucks . Bail bums out of jail . Well , anyway , college boy , I have about twenty bucks left . Here , take seven . That keeps us even . Hey , speaking of loot , what the fuck happened to all your wad , man ? A two-week drunk for one thing . Anyway , hoard this cash , man . It 's got to last us until we get to Miami and land jobs . I ai n't worried about it , man . I do n't expect to ever see Miami . I expect to be starved to death long before then . Well , I 'll give you a decent burial . Then I guess I 'll have to be a handsome lifeguard at one of those fancy hotel pools gettingp154pussy all by myself . And when I get on a sunken treasure expedition I 'll think of you . I 'll never see Miami , Pace said . No way . Not if you keep eating nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ applepie . Jimbo and Pace both got popsicles for dessert and Pace ambled over to a revolving rack of comic books . Jimbo found a paperback bookrack , which he spun slowly , scanning titles . Well , well , Jimbo thought and smiled when he spotted a copy of On the Road . He had given his latest copy away a month ago , the sixth copy he had either bought or stolen and then given away to someone since he had first read the book . He had given two copies to Judy , both of which she had lost before ever opening . Jimbo casually glanced around the drugstore . The waitress was busy washing dishes and only a fat girl looking at movie magazines was anywhere nearby . Holding the popsicle to his mouth with his left hand , Jimbo picked the paperback from the rack with his right and with a quick move smoothly slid it up under his loose shirttail and stuffed it in his pants waist . Jimbo arched his eyebrows and took a long sweet suck from his cherry popsicle . When he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking at him . She was wearing tight black pedal pushers and her hair was up in huge yellow rollers and when Jimbo looked at her she grinned . Jimbo looked back at the paperback rack . Caught in the act ? he wondered . Well , it was too late now . If she said anything he would just pay up and try to talk his ass out of it . A group of teenagers , three girls and two boys , came into the drugstore and walked back to the fountain stools . The two boys were tall and thin and had long greasy ducks . The sleeves of their white T-shirts were rolled up high on their arms and in the tight folds both carried packs of cigarettes . Punk localyokels , Jimbo thought with a sneer . They were cracking stupid jokes and trying to flirt with one of the girls who was blond and very pretty . She was wearing red short shorts and when she sat down on a stool the flesh of her tan thighs spread softly over the black vinyl top . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by its handle like it was some sort of musical purse and she set it on the countertop and turned it up . The pretty blond began spinning around on the stool , snapping her fingers in time to the music and kicking out her smooth legs . She glanced toward Jimbo . Jimbo held the popsicle down at his side and slowly edged over to where Pace was intently reading a Little Lulu comic . You want this popsicle ? Jimbo said . What ? What ? The man do n't want his popsicle ? Jesus . Just take the fucker , Jimbo said and looked around . The fat girl was watching him and grinning . What 's with her anyway ? he thought . Jimbo walked over to the postcard rack and began spinning it slowly . He took his glasses off and put them in his shirt pocket . He ran a hand slowly through his hair and then rubbed the back of his neck and rolled his head around in a little circle . Ah , yes , the handsome , mysterious stranger from the road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and wrinkled his forehead and examined the postcards intently through his squinted eyes . He took out his pack of Camels and tapped it lightly against the edge of one hand , smoothly sliding a cigarette out , which he then took from the pack with his lips . With his right hand he got out a book of paper matches and flipped it open with his thumb . Using only his right hand , he folded over a match and flicked it against the striker with his thumb . He lit his cigarette and frenchinhaled deeply . Glancing up , Jimbo saw that the pretty blond was sitting with her back to him and talking intently with one of her girlfriends . Fuck her , Jimbo thought . She was chattering about a date she had for tonight with this real cute boy who had a tough red convertible . Red convertible , shit . Fuck her . Jimbo was certain this information was for his benefit . Her voice was just too loud to be natural . He wondered if she really did have a date with a guy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just trying to make him jealous . He wondered if she screwed , if she banged like a screen door and went down like a submarine . He wondered if the guy in the tough red convertible wouldp156have her down in the seat tonight . Wonder what old Judy would be doing tonight ? Probably still waiting for him to pick her up . He 'd left her cooling her heels once and for all . That was for sure . He wondered if her suitcase was still hidden in the bushes beside her house where he was supposed to pick it up and stash it in the Silver Ghost before he came to the door to get her for their heavy date . A heavy date Frankie had loaned him the Silver Ghost for . A heavy date that little did Frankie know was supposed to be a getaway for Jimbo and Judy to find their perfect summerplace where Judy could have their baby and they could frenchkiss forever in peace . Well , he had made a getaway all right and this time the joke was on old Judy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hutch Bodine fuck her all he wanted . Jimbo did n't give a royal shit anymore . Let her run off with Hutch Bodine somewhere and have the goddamn little bastard . One thing was for sure . The joke was not going to be on old Captain Rebel Without a Cause On the Road this time . Come on , Pace , let 's cut out , Jimbo said and picked out a postcard of a local Dixie Court Motel . He could write " Wish you were here " on its back and mail it to old Judy . Now that was abstract . Jimbo liked being abstract . It went along with being cute . Jimbo grinned and ambled to the counter up front near the door and paid for the postcard . Hold up , man , I 'm going to get some shades for the Florida rays , Pace said and pointed to a revolving rack behind the counter displaying sunglasses . You better hold on to your cash , man , Jimbo said . He glanced at the rack himself . It looked like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaves . Hard rays in Floridaland , man , Pace said . A cat needs shades . Suit yourself , amigo , Jimbo said and picked up the suitcase and walked out the door . The hot air nearly took his breath away . His skin felt immediately sticky again and he had to blink back salty tears in the bright sunlight . The sidewalk was dazzling with small bright points of light and heat wavesp157quivered up into the air from the blue metal of a Pontiac parked at the curb . Jimbo fired up a Camel and studied the drugstore 's display window . Taped to the bottom right corner was a hand-painted poster announcing a revival meeting at the Grace Baptist Church Sunday night which would be broadcast live over a local radio station . Broadcast live . It made Jimbo think strangely of bait stuck on a hook and cast live into water . Live bait is the best , Captain always said . Live bait wiggles . Broadcast live . Broadcast live into the airwaves . Like his mother had almost been . The gang had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drinking and hunting for something to do for kicks . They were celebrating . Jimbo Stark was back from the boondocksand buying all the booze they could drink with his highschool graduation loot . Hey , there 's a tent revival at the edge of town , Boots had said . Well , let 's just cruise out there and get a few laughs at the Christians , Jimbo had said . They had gotten a.few laughs all right . Christians testifying live over the radio about what they had been cured of by the love and grace of Jesus amen . I was cured of a deformed foot amen . I was cured of the piles thank you Jesus . The gang had stood at the back of the hot , brightly lit tent near a door passing a pint in a paper bag and getting lots of laughs . I was cured of throat cancer , the tall , gaunt man had croaked into the microphone . Sounds like he 's got a frog in his throat , Boots had said and the gang snickered . I was cured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dress shyly said . Lots of laughs all right . Get a load of that , Boots had said and punched Jimbo 's arm when a middle-aged midget woman beating a tambourine lightly against her leg walked down the sawdust aisle toward the stage . Probably cured of bad breath , Boots said and the gang snickered . Hey , Jimbo , look over there , man , Pace had said and pointed to a far aisle . Her face was glistening in the tent 's heat . Her eyes were wide and bright and a strange smile was frozen on her face . She was walking down the far aisle toward the stage . Jesus , Jimbo thought and shut his eyes and pressed hisp158forehead against the display window 's warm glass . He had to refuse to remember . That was the trick . When you are on the road you just refuse to remember . That 's what being on the road was all about . Memory was like tracks . The good traveler left no tracks . I seen what you did in there . Jimbo blinked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was standing behind him holding a flabby armful of movie magazines . When he looked at her she gave a little nervous laugh and glanced away . What ? Jirnbo said and blinked his eyes . I seen what you did in there , the fat girl said and winked . What 's that supposed to mean ? What 's with you anyway ? I seen you steal that book in there , she said and laughednervously and winked again . You do n't sweat much for a fat girl , do yo  --  imbo said and arched his eyebrows . Well , I like you too , the fat girl said and turned and hurried away up the street . Hey , wait up , Jimbo called and trotted after her . Hey , listen , I 'm sorry . I did n't mean anything . Well , like I always say , sticks and stones can break my bones but words can never hurt me . Listen , I 'm sorry . Here , Jimbo said and took the book from under his shirt . You want it ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Really . It 's a good book . It 's one of my favorites . Stick it up your ass , the fat girl said and walked away . Jimbo and Pace had been let out after a long ride at the edge of a small city and after a local copcar had slowed down as it had passed them , the one cop in it giving them a long onceover , they had walked for a couple of miles to get out onto the open road before hitchhiking again . They were on a straight stretch and could see car headlights at a distance so they walked in the middle of the road , clomping along in cadence on the blacktop . Jimbo could hear frogs from the brush onp159both sides of the road and fireflies were blinking in the deeper shadows under the trees . To their left were stands of pines , which sent a clean resin smell into the air . To their right the land was mostly clear and in the distance at intervals across the open fields they could see lights from farmhouses . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . Courage , amigo . Man , I 've never been so beat , Pace said , adjusting the sunglasses on the bridge of his nose . You do n't need those shades , amigo , Jimbo said . It 's dark out . I like to be Cool at all times , Pace said and adjusted the sunglasses again . I owe it to my fans . Fans my ass , Jimbo said . The sunglasses had bright reflectingsurfaces , as though Pace was wearing two little mirrors over his eyes . All afternoon Jimbo had stared at the two small images of himself he saw reflected in those glasses . He wished he had bought a pair himself . You owe it to your ass not to fall on it in the dark , amigo , Jimbo said . Cool cats do n't ever fall down , man , Pace said and turned up his radio . The car did not even slow down as it approached them . Jimbo and Pace hurried to the side of the road and stuck out their thumbs . Jimbo had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cocksucker ! Jimbo yelled as the car sped past them . He rubbed his eyes with his fists . Hey , man , Pace said , tapping Jimbo 's shoulder . The car had pulled to a halt up the highway and was slowly backing toward them . Maybe he heard you , Pace said . So what ? Jimbo said . I 'm in an ass-kicking mood , amigo . When the car reached themJimbo bent to the closed shotgun seat window and arched his eyebrows . The driver , a darkhairedmiddle-aged man , stared intently at Jimbo through heavy plastic-rimmed glasses.  |p160Thanks  for the ride , mister , Jimbo said and gripped the doorhandle . The driver made no move to unlock the door or roll down the window . His intent stare made Jimbo glance away . What 's with this guy ? Jimbo thought . Toss your suitcase in back , the driver said after finally opening the door . He still kept glancing at Jimbo . Jimbo and Pace climbed in the frontseat with Pace in the middle . The car was a current model Chevy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smell . Do we know each other , sir ? Jimbo asked the driver . I do n't think so , the driver said . He pulled the car back out onto the highway . I did n't mean to gape like that . You look like someone . I 've been told that before , Jimbo said and laughed . People tell me I look like this moviestar . What moviestar is that ? the driver asked . James Dean . People say I look like a deadringer for James Dean . Except I have dark hair . Is that a fact now ? Well , sorry , James , but that 's not who I had in mind . You know , everyone seems to think they look like this or that moviestar . In fact , people tell me I look like the late , great Humphrey Bogart . Can you see it ? The world-weary face . The sad , knowing eyes . The voice . Listen . Play it again , Sam . I guess so , Jimbo said . You guess so , the driver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again , Sam . You 're gon na have to take the fall , sweetheart . And you only guess so . Sure , Jimbo said . I can see it . Who was it I reminded you of ? You do n't know the party . What 's your destination , sports ? Floridaland , Pace said . Gon na soak up rays . Suck oranges . That 's a long haul . How far are you going , sir ? Jimbo asked . Oh , I guess I 'll know when I get there . Where in Florida are you boys heading ? Miami , sir , Jimbo said . We have jobs lined up with myp161uncle 's construction company . We 're saving up for college next fall . Well , well , the driver said . Boys with ambition . I 'm dulyimpressed . What 's going to be your chosen profession ? I 've been thinking about the ministry , sir , Jimbo said . Bullshit , sonny , the driver said and laughed . What makes you say that , mister ? Forget it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guys go by ? If you do n't mind telling me that is . We do n't mind at all , Jimbo said . Not at all . I 'm Sal . Sal Paradise . And my friend here is Dean Moriarty . You do n't say , Jake said , laughing . You do n't say . Old Sal and Dean . Old Sal and Dean on the highroads of America . Searching high and low for old Dean 's long-lost dad I bet . You guys must be on the lam . I thought so as soon as I saw you . What gives you that idea , sir ? Jimbo said . What did you tough customers do ? Rob a bank ? Knock over an armored car ? Snatch an old lady 's purse ? Hey , am I in danger ? You tough customers would n't knock me off , would you ? A fine fellow who picked you up and all ? No , Jimbo said . We 'll give you a break . We wo n't knock you off . That sure puts my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , boys ? Reach in that glove compartment , Sal boy . There 's a little bottle of hooch in a paper bag . Help yourselves , boys . This I can use . Thanks , Jimbo said . He got out the bottle and took a long hit . You want a drink , sir ? No thanks , Sal boy . I have my own special poison right here , the driver said and took a small medicine bottle from his shirt pocket . He opened it with one hand and took a deep drink . Let me have a hit , Pace said and Jimbo passed him the bottle . Old Sal and Dean on the road , the driver said and laughed . Jack will get a real kick out of this all right . When I tell him I ran into a couple of real tough customers named Sal and Dean on the road . He 'll get a real kick . I do n't get you , sir , Jimbo said.  |p162Old  Jack is a pal of mine . Jack ? Jack who ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , come on now . What are you all talking about anyway ? Pace said . Do you really know him ? Really ? Jack and I go a long way back , the driver said . He 'll get a real charge out of this . Who ? Pace asked . Who in the hell is Jack ? I 'll be goddamned , Jimbo said and laughed . Some aliases you came up with , Sal boy . Some aliases . Will someone tell me what the hell you guys are talking about ? Pace said . Jack Kerouac , Jimbo said . He knows Jack Kerouac . Who 's that ? Pace said . So what ? Jesus , turdface , Jimbo said . He wrote that book I gave you last year . On the Road . My goddamn favorite book . Sal Paradise and Dean Moriarty are the heroes of On the Road . Well , sort of the heroes I guess . Sort of is right , the driver said , laughing . Why do n't you run some more aliases by me . I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I guess you could say we are sort of on the lam . Hey , who are you anyway ? How do you know Kerouac ? I 'm Jake . Jake Barnes . You ever hear of me ? No . I do n't think I have anyway , Jimbo said . Should I have ? I mean , are you famous or something ? Not lately . Well , I 'm glad to know you , Mr. Barnes , Jimbo said . Hey , cut the mister crap . Please . The mister and sir crapmakes me feel old . I 'm only forty , for Christ 's sake . Well , how do you know Keroua  --  imbo said . What do youdo ? Oh , I guess you could call me an engineer of sorts . Somethingof a troubleshooter . When there 's trouble on a job I hop in and clear it up . Good thing about my job is I have to bust ass for a few weeks or maybe months sometimes but then I get to lay off with pay for long spells . Get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I met old Jack about ten years ago when I was hanging out in the Village pretending to myself and to the world I was a poet . The world knew better . Jack and I have done our share of shitkicking together since then I 'll say . I 'll be damned , Jimbo said . I write poetry myself . I 'm not surprised , Jake said . Do you mind if I turn on the radio , Jake ? Pace asked . Feel free . Feel free . Listen , can both you boys drive ? Sure , Jimbo said . Well , to tell you boys the truth , it so happens that I 'm heading for Miami myself . And I 'm in something of a hurry , see . So if you boys can give me a hand with the driving we 'll just team up for the rest of the trip . Jesus ! Jimbo said . That 's great ! Hot shit ! Pace yelled and rapped furiously on the dashboard in time with a rock-and-roll song on the radio . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Jimbo said . This is just great . Well , it works both ways . You sports are doing me a favor too . I could use the company and you boys both look like you can hold up your end of a deal . You seem like boys I can count on . You better believe it , Jimbo said . We 'll do our share all right , Pace said . Hey , Jake , let me ask you something , Jimbo said . Shoot . How come you 're in such a hurry to get to Miami ? Jimbo said , laughing . Are you on the lam too or something ? Jimbo , everybody is on the lam from something , Jake said . It 's part of the human condition . Actually , I just finished up a big job and I 'm taking a well-deserved , extended vacation . Now the reason I 'm in such a hurry is that I 'm horny as hell . And there 's a sweet , beautiful , willing woman waiting for me in Miami . You 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an old dog like me that sweet , beautiful , willing women are hard to come by . And this lady is something special . Cuban lady , with darkp164flashing eyes and long black hair and mystery in her laugh . I met her during my smuggling days and she 's held a piece of my old heart ever since . Jesus , you were a smuggler ? Jimbo said . In a manner of speaking . I was n't a pro . I did n't do it for profit . Arms to Castro when he was still in the hills and I still believed in him . And I really did believe in him once . That commie cocksucker . Does your Cuban lady have any beautiful sister  --  imbo said . Do n't worry about that , Jake said , laughing . Stick with me and I 'll fix you up good . Hey , turdface , Jimbo said and punched Pace in the shoulder . This is it . We 're adventuring , amigo . Dig it , Kemosabe , Pace said and turned up the radio . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here we come . Damn right dig it ! Jirnbo said , laughing . Jake , mind if I roll down the window for a while ? Feel free , Jimbo . Feel free . The window had a sticky new-car feel to it as Jimbo rolled it down . Jimbo shut his eyes . The rushing night air was warm on his face . Well , this is it , Jimbo thought . On the road . Really on the road . Roaring through the sweet southern night with a mysterious madman poet toward Miami . Miami . God , how that name burned in his brain . Wild tropical nights in smugglers ' beachfront bar hangouts . Glasses of dark rum poured by black-haired Cuban beauties with mystery in their laughs . Jimbo opened his eyes and watched the white line in the middle of the road reel them relentlessly south . He was leaving confusion and sadness and bullshit behind at last . He had found the groove of his life at last . Sure , there were things he felt bad about . But there was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't do anything for his mother . No more than he could that horrible night when he spotted her walking down the aisle unbuttoning her blouse . He had charged out into the darkness and run until he collapsed , exhausted . And Judy . But she had made her own bed . Even if she had fuckedp165Hutch Bodine only once . I swear it only happened once , she had sobbed over the phone . It 's you I love . Please . It 's our baby . I swear to God it 's our baby . Sorry , Judy . Once was once too often . Sure , he still loved her . But he would get over it . At least there was nothing about old cocksucking Captain to make him feel bad . He had spent a year in the fucking boondocksjust like Captain had ordered . And he had kept his nose clean . No fights . Drank alone secretly . Kissed his crazy grandmother'sass . Got good grades . Had not asked for a thing . Had even returned the allowance Captain had sent . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Captain had not even come to his highschool graduation . Well , so what ? Who gives a big shit ? Anyway , Jimbo had gotten the last word . He had kissed off old Captain and his chickenshit once and for all . Last night . God , was it only last night ? It seemed like a year ago . Ten years ago . Blaring the radio and beating crazily on the horn , Jimbo had roared the Silver Ghost up Captain 's street . He had pulled the Silver Ghost up over the curb right into Captain 's frontyard . Leaving the radio blaring and the bright headlights on , Jimbo had stalked out in front of the car . He had stood there in the bright headlights shouting for Captain . Come on out and play , Captain old boy , Jimbo had shouted at the dark front of the house . Come on out and slide your ass down my cellar door , Captain old boy old pal . Neighbors ' porch lights began to flash on . Pace yelled from the car for him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ na call the cops , Pace yelled . Hey , Captain , come climb in my rain barrel , Jimbo shouted . Hey , Captain , let 's be jolly friends forevermore . No light came on in the dark house , no sign of Captain at all . The goddamn BozoBoat was parked in the driveway so old Captain had to be home . So what 's the story on old Captain ? Jimbo had wondered . Well , either he 's hiding in the dark behind one of those windows too chickenshit to come out and play or he 's passed out down in his chickenshit bomb shelter . Neighbors came out onto their porches . Come on , Pace yelled . The cops will be here , man ! Jimbo had fired up a Camel , thenp166slouched slowly over to the BozoBoat . He had taken a long , leisurely leak into the BozoBoat 's open front window . Flashing the finger at all the nosy neighbors , Jimbo had slouched back to the Silver Ghost . He had backed it out into the street and , blasting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  |p167Jake  Barnes had been about everywhere and done about everythingall right . As they drove south that night and the following day , taking turns behind the wheel , Jake told one story after another about his wild youth . When they passed a chain gang chopping brush beside the road in the early morning , Jake told about the six months he had once spent on just such a chain gang before finally escaping with a big spade through the Georgia piney woods . He had been in on an assault charge after a roadside tavern fight in which he had beaten a bullying off-duty deputy sheriff silly . Those six months on the chain gang had been a living hell , Jake told them . He and the big spade had been lucky in their escape and before the hounds tracked them they had made it to the railroad tracks where they had hopped a freight north to freedom . All that had happened years ago but if he was ever stopped for anything in Georgia and they ran a check on him he would probably end up right back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So drive carefully in Georgia , boys , Jake had said and laughed . When Jimbo was stopped for going through a caution light in a small Georgia town by a local redneck cop , Jake said , Well , boys , this might be the end of the ride and he got out of the car to do the talking . Somehow he soon had the redneck cop laughing and they got to go on without even having their licenses checked . Early that afternoon they pickedp168up a hitchhiking soldier whom Jake talked with at great length about his own days in the service . He had seen a lot of action in the South Pacific and had been wounded at Okinawa . He had reenlisted when the Korean conflict broke out and had been wounded again at Pork Chop Hill . Jake insisted on turninginland west for nearly fifty miles to take the soldier to his hometown . " Not many guys would do this , mister , " the soldiersaid when Jake let him out in front of his parents ' home . Jake had been stopping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Florida line in the late afternoon Jimbo and Pace were high and happy . They yelled and cheered and from the windows tossed confetti they had made by tearing up a newspaper . Damn , but I wish my boy Nick was with us right now , Jake said . You have a son ? Jimbo asked . Yeah , Nick . Old Nick just turned twenty . Let me tell you he 's a pisser . That goddamn kid is always into some kind of goddamn beef . Where is he ? Jimbo asked . Atlantic City . My wife passed away a few years back . Nick stays with my sister most of the time . Comes up to stay with me at my place in New York every now and then but we always end up tangling over something and he takes off . I 've got a cottage over on the Jersey shore and he stays there during the summer sometimes . Real independent kid . He gets around all right that kiddo . Gets in a beef in Atlantic City , then hightails it up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York until he gets his ass in a jam there . Then he takes off again . Some kid . He sounds like a tough customer , Jimbo said . Tough customer is right . But he 'll be all right . I was worse when I was his age . He 'll settle down . Meanwhile , though , all he thinks about are fast cars and chippies . Just like his goodfor-nothingold man used to . Just like me I guess , Jimbo said and everyone laughed . Pace turned up the radio and Jimbo rolled down his win/dow . The evening air was hot and moist and smelled heavily sweet like rotting fruit . Jimbo had a sudden picture of rotting oranges glistening with flies . Through the insect-smeared windshield he watched the carlights illuminate the high walls of trees looming at the narrow road 's edges . From his side windowJimbo stared intently into the close , dark swamp . The Everglades , he said to himself . Jungle . Tropics . Tropical . Even the word was mysterious , magical . Deadly snakes camouflaged among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black water . Showers of exotic insects . Glowing swamp gas . Shimmering apparitions . Lost Spanish spirits . Ancient , unknown Seminole villages . Indian holy men chanting in firelight . Low drums . Voodoo . Jimbo shut his eyes and breathed in the hot , moist night air deeply . He was getting closer and closer to the true beginning of his life . Somewhere near a tropical rebirth waited for him . He would be someone new , nameless , mysterious . His life was unfolding now like an opening black orchid . Moths swooped in from the darkness about the brightly lit SAVE sign above the gas pumps . The rambling , one-story , wood-frame building was blazing with neon beer signs and two old men were sitting in rusted lawn chairs on a narrow concrete front porch . One of the old men got up and walked slowly over to the car as Jake lined it up at a high-test gas pump . Jake told him to fill it up and check the oil and do n't forget to clean the dead bugs off the windshield @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around stretching . Boys , I have some calls I better make before it gets too late . Why do n't you sports go in and grab some snacks ? Jake said . He walked over to a phone booth at one end of the porch . The old man sitting on the porch silently stared at Jimbo and Pace as they crunched across the gravel to the mothencrustedscreen door . There was a DRINK NEHI sign on the door and along both sides were signs advertising FRESH RIVER FISH : CATFISH , PERCH , DRUM , EEL , BUFFALO . What in the hell is a buffalofish ? Jimbo wondered , getting a crazy picture of a shaggy , big-headed fish with a huge hump.  |p170Pace  let the screen door bang behind him when they entered and several men standing around a pool table in the back of the long , low room looked up . The front part of the room had several narrow aisles of shelves stacked with canned and packaged goods and along one wall were pop coolers and racks of silvery potato-chip packages . Along the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ building . Pace headed directly for the pop coolers . Jimbo browsed among the aisles until he spotted a swivel bookrack of paperbacks . He fired up a Camel and idly glanced through the titles . A jukebox blared hillbilly music from the back and Jimbo hummed along with a tune as he turned the bookrack . Most of the paperbacks were westerns or thrillers with words like naked or lust or virgin in their titles and had covers with half-naked voluptuous women lying tangled in sheets on damp-looking beds . Miami , Jimbo thought . This time tomorrow night they would be in Miami . Black-haired harlots . Cuban mulatto lovers . You gon na buy that book , boy ? Jimbo looked up from the bookrack . A young , heavyset blond man in a military uniform was leaning against the counter only a few feet from him . Two other men from the back were standing nearby watching . The young soldier grinned at Jimbo and took a long pull on his bottle of beer . What book ? Jimbo asked . That book you stole , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ copy of On the Road in his hip pocket . I had that book when I came in , Jimbo said . He looked back to the bookrack . I saw you slip it in your pocket , boy , the blond soldier said . I told you I already had this book , Jimbo said and arched his eyebrows . Yeah , he had that book before he came in here , Pace said . He was sitting on a pop cooler sipping an orange soda . Hell , man , he swiped that book yesterday . You mind your business , the soldier said to Pace . Now , I say I saw this boy stick that book in his pocket . He stole it off thisp171rack . Hell , this is my old friend Sam Harlin 's store . I ca n't let you steal something from old Sam . I did n't steal it here , man , Jimbo said . You see , boy , I just got out of M.P . training . I 'm with the Military Police , do n't you see . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your ass , see .. I 'm gon na put your ass in custody . You know what ? Jimbo said and wrinkled his forehead . What , pretty boy ? You read too many comic books , Jimbo said . Oh Jesus ! Pace muttered . He hopped off the pop cooler and rushed over beside Jimbo . Hey , man , he really did have that book when he came in . Honest , mister . Too many comic books , huh ? the soldier said . He put his beer bottle down on the counter . Well , like I said , I got my duty . Let 's you and me take us a little stroll on out front , pretty boy . I got all kinds of brand-new judo tricks I want to show my buddies . Hell , I been home on leave two goddamn weeks and I ai n't had the chance to kick one single ass with all my new judo tricks . Until now that is . Hey , come on , mister , Pace said . We just came in here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Pace . Come on , now , the soldier said and crooked his forefinger at Jimbo to follow . Let 's get to it . You boys get everything you need ? Jake said . He was standing in the door . This guy claims Jimbo stole a book , Pace said . Must be some mistake , Jake said . I say I saw him , the soldier said and squinted his eyes at Jake . Must be some mistake , friend , Jake said , smiling . That 's my son you 're accusing . He would n't steal anything . I 've raised him to be a real good boy . Churchgoing . An Eagle Scout . Did you boys get anything ? I got an orange pop , Pace said . How about you , son ? Jake asked Jimbo.  |p172I  do n't want anything , Jimbo said . This should cover things , Jake said and spread a dollar bill on the counter . He walked over and put an arm around Jimbo 's shoulder and moved him toward the door . Jimbo turned his head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , Jake said and herded Jimbo through the door . Pace scooted after them . That prick , Jimbo said as they walked across the gravel lot to the car . I could take his ass , man . He 'd be sucking soup till his teeth grew back in . I believe you , Jimbo , Jake said . But what 's the percentage ? Why bother ? It 's just trouble , sport . One thing you do n't need when you 're on the lam is trouble . The screen door banged in back of them . Hey , buddy , I ai n't quite done talking to your boy , the soldier said . He was standing at the edge of the porch . Several of his buddies leaned against the building . They were all grinning . The soldier took a swig from his beer bottle , then tossed it out beyond the front lights . He hopped off the porch . I got a duty to my cronies here , do n't you see ? the soldier said . I promised to show them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Jake said , laughing , let me buy you a drink . Listen , I 've got a little bottle in a paper bag right here under my frontseat . Great hooch . Twelve years old . What do you say , friend ? Have a shooter with me , OK ? I ai n't gon na bang your little boy up too much , buddy , the soldier said and walked slowly toward them . I 'll just toss him around a little while . Just till I work up a little sweat , O  --  ust for a little exercise . I want him , Jimbo said and moved toward the soldier . Jake shoved Jimbo back against the car . Get the hell in the car , sport , Jake said . I mean it . Either get in the goddamn car or get out of here . If you do n't get in the goddamn car you can walk to Miami for all I care . Fuck , Jimbo said . He slid into the frontseat and sat there pounding a palm with a fist . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , friend , we do n't want trouble . Come on over and have a shooter of this great hooch with me , Jake said and reached under the frontseat . Hell , maybe I 'll just toss your ass around awhile instead of your boy , buddy , the soldier said . He walked slowly up to the car . I kinda hate to throw old guys around though . I hate to hear them old bones breaking . Using the open cardoor to shield its sight from the men standing on the porch , Jake took a shiny , nickel-plated pistol out of the paper sack . Holding it low , he leveled it at the soldier and cocked it . The soldier 's eyes popped wide and he just stood there looking back and forth from Jake 's face to the pistol . Well , you went and bought it , boy , Jake said quietly , smiling . Oops , the soldier said . Oops is right , friend , Jake said and chuckled . Well , friend , just how serious do you want to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you really want to get down to some serious cutting and shooting ? Hey , listen , mister , I ai n't nearly as serious about this situationas I thought I was , the soldier said . Well , good , friend . It 's such a nice , pleasant , balmy night out for any serious cutting and shooting . So we 'll just say good night now and be on our way . Is that perfectly all right with you ? Listen , mister , that 's fine with me . Good night , then . Say good night to your friends for us . You bet . Good night , mister , the soldier said . He began backing slowly away from the car . Jake uncocked the pistol , put it back in the paper sack , then stuck it under the frontseat . He got in the car , started it up , and pulled it slowly out onto the highway . Jesus Christ , Jake , Jimbo said . Were you serious ? Oh , I can get as serious as I need to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? I did n't figure it would come to anything like that . A punkp174kid like that does n't have it in him to get too serious . You see , I believe spitting teeth is for suckers . Hell , I do n't believe in any kind of trouble unless there 's a percentage in it . You can usually talk or bluff your way out of trouble . Thing is , never call a bluff unless you 're able to back it up if you have to . Then you would have shot that guy if he 'd come on ? Oh , probably not , Jake said and laughed . I would have probably just slapped his punk ass around a bit . I guess I was just sort of showing off to you guys by pulling the rod . Give you something to tell your friends back home . You did that all right , Jimbo said . Hey , what kind of pistol is that ? Can I shoot it sometime , Jake ? A .45 automatic . Sure , you can shoot it sometime . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jimbo said . Sure , why not ? Now we really are armed and dangerous I guess , Jimbo said , laughing . You better believe it , Jake said . Late that night when they reached the outskirts of St. AugustinePace was asleep in the backseat andJimbo was trying to stay awake . Jake yawned and said that he just was not the hard charger he once was and that they would have to stop for the night . That sweet , black-eyed woman will just have to wait a little longer , Jake said and laughed . It 's hard to be an old dog , boys . Jake pulled into a motel called the Ponce de Leon Motor Court whose elaborate pink neon signs advertised a garden pool and free teevee . Well , what do you think of old Jake ? Jimbo asked Pace whenJake went into the motel 's office to check on a room . I thought he was totally full of bullshit until back at thatbeerjoint , Pace said . I do n't know , man . He 's a strange cat . Ido @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I think he 's all right . At least he 's not queer or anything . He 's got that son and all . And he was a marine.  |p175So  he says . Well , like you said , the way he handled that situation back at the beerjoint was pretty cool . I have a feeling he can back up a lot of his bullshit . Yeah , me too I guess . I agree he sure ai n't any queer . Like , those tattoos on his arms ? I do n't think queers go for tattoos . Right , Jimbo said and fired up a Camel . Anyway , what harm could he do us ? I mean , if he would pull anything we 'd just cold-cock him . He looks pretty tough to me , man . I could handle him if I had to . But , like I said , I think he 's all right . Hell , he 's been paying for everything . And he tells great stories whether they 're bullshit or not . I think he 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out when he picked us up . I really do , amigo . Time will tell . Hey , turdface , why be such a pessimist ? You 're probably right , man . Jake came out of the office with a thin , middle-aged woman whose hair looked orange in the pink neon light . They were talking and laughing as they followed a flagstone walk from the office to the semicircle of Spanish-style , pink stucco cottagesin back . Jake waved for them to bring the car . He stood in front of a cottage near the center of the semicircle and directed Jimbo into a slanted parking slot . This is Sally , boys , Jake said , introducing the lady when they got out of the car . She owns and operates the Ponce de Leon Motor Court . How do you do , ma'am , Jimbo said . Howdy , Pace said . I hope you all will be real comfy now , Sally said with a twitter . She smelled of whiskey and heavy Jungle Gardenia perfume . Just holler if you all need more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take a refreshing dip I 'll turn the lights back on around the pool . I could sure dig a dip , ma'am , Pace said.  |p176Well  , I 'll just go turn the lights on then . Just try to be a teensy bit quiet as most of my other guests have retired for the night . The room was paneled in imitation knotty pine and its pale green ceiling glittered in the lamplight . Jake tossed his suitcase on the bed nearest the bathroom and opened it . Jimbo clicked on the teevee . Pace sat on the other bed and bounced up and down . I hope you sports do n't mind sharing a bunk , Jake said . It 's all right , Jimbo said . Oh , we 'll just love it , Pace said and fluttered his eyelashes . We 'll just have the best old time . I 've got to get the hell out of this smelly goddamn shirt fast , Jake said . He took off his flower-print sportshirt . There were several long purple scars across his chest and stomach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them and there was a small tattoo of a heart over his left nipple . Jesus Christ , Pace said . You really did get some war wounds . Pretty , are n't they ? Jake said , laughing . The ladies do n't seem to mind , though . Seems to intrigue most of them in fact . Between the scars and the tattoos my whole body is a conversationpiece . I usually do n't tell the ladies I got the wounds in the service , though . That 's boring . War wounds are a dime a dozen . I usually make up some real exotic bullshit baloney about how I got them . I can believe that , Pace said and Jimbo punched his shoulder . Right , Jake said , laughing . I can dish up the bullshit all right . But the thing about being a big bullshitter is that you develop a built-in , shockproof bullshit detector of your own . Nothing wrong with bullshit , boys , as long as you never bullshit yourself . And speaking of bullshit , Jimbo boy , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , sonny boy . You 're my boy now . I do n't get you , Jake , Jimbo said and arched his eyebrows . When I signed the motel register , Jake said and laughedp177again , I put you down as my son . My son and his best pal Pace . So it would n't look queer , sport . An old dog like me teamed up with a couple of kids could look a little odd , right ? And since we 're all on the lam we do n't want to draw attention to ourselves , right ? So as far as old sweet Sally is concernedyou 're my boy . All right , kiddo ? Sure , Jimbo said . Sure thing , daddy-o . Hey , I 'm jealous , Pace said . How come I could n't be the son and Jimbo the pal ? Here 's one reason , sport , Jake said . He took a small goldframedpicture out of his suitcase . He looked at it for a moment , then handed it to Pace . What do you think of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the picture to Jimbo . It could be your twin brother , man . Jimbo studied the picture . It was of a boy about his own age sitting on the front fender of an old Chevy . The boy did resemble him . Who is he , Jake ? Jimbo asked . That 's old Nick , that 's who , Jake said , laughing . That 's why I skidded to a stop last night and then kept staring at you after I picked you up . Can you believe it ? You two almost could be twin brothers . When I spotted you in my headlights as I shot past last night it startled the hell out of me . For a minute I thought you were old Nick himself out there hitchhiking . I 'll be damn , Jimbo said . He handed Jake the picture . Yeah . I 'll have to get a snapshot of you before we split up to show Nick , Jake said and set the picture on the small table between the beds . Old Nick will get a kick out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ na hit that pool , Pace said and took his trunks from the suitcase . I 'll be right behind you , amigo , Jimbo said . Hell , I might even take a dip myself , Jake said . Last one in is a rotten asshole , Pace said , pulling off his jeans . Hey , boys , Jake said . Listen , hold up a minute . I better tell you there 's been a little change in my immediate plans . What 's that , Jake ? Jimbo asked  |p178It  's those calls I made back at that roadside joint . I talked to my Cuban honey , see . And to a couple of other friends I have down Miami way . It 's not a good idea for me to hit town for a couple of days . There are a couple of characters around town right now I 'd best avoid if I can . Including my honey 's husband . So I 'm going to hang out here in old St. Augustine for a few days before I head down the coast . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me and head on down in a few days . I enjoy your company . Hell , it 's almost like having old Nick and one of his pals along . Except we get along better than me and old Nick . But , if you boys want to shoot on down to Miami that 's all right . And since I told you I 'd take you all the way I 'll spring for the bus tickets . Either way , sports , it 's up to you . Hell , we 're not in that big a hurry , are we ? Jimbo asked Pace . I 'm with you , Kemosabe . Whatever you want to do . Hell , Jake , then we 'll stick with you if it 's really all right , Jimbo said . The only problem is we 're short of dough . We might have to borrow some from you till we land jobs in Miami . You guys do n't have to worry about dough . I figure you even have some salary coming for helping me drive . And do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot of people in that town who owe me favors . Anyway , we 'll just sort of lay low and play tourists in old St. Augustine for a few days . I 'll give you sports a regular guided tour . I 've never been much of a tourist myself , man , Pace said . Listen , the only way to go through life is like a tourist . Youshould be a tourist every goddamn minute of your life . Everysecond . I dig it , Jimbo said . You know , Jimbo old boy , Jake said , I hope I get the chance to introduce you to old Kerouac someday . He 'd love you , kiddo.  |p179The  pool was in a garden of palms and flowering plants in the center of the semicircle of pink stucco cottages . It was kidney shaped with a marble fish-shaped fountain at its smaller end , a fish shaped like a leaping porpoise with a thin stream of water arching from its pursed lips into the pool . Blue spotlightswere arranged in the palms with their beams playing on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the thick flowering bushes under the palms stood brightly painted plaster-of-paris peacocks and flamingos . Pace 's red transistor radio played softly from a poolside table while Pace sat at the pool 's edge idly kicking his dangling feet in the water in time to the music . Jimbo floated on his back in the center of the small end of the pool . He was looking up through the thick palm fronds at the black , star-filled sky and thinking about the loss of love . If only Judy had not tried to con him . That was the real rub . If only she had told him about Bodine instead of Pace . And if Judy had not told Penny who told Pace , Jimbo would not know about it even now . God , how he had loved her . What went wrong ? They had written and called each other all year . Then , just when he was so confident in her love , Judy had mailed back the only ring in the whole wide world and had asked Hutch Bodine to be her lucky escort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do it ? He had loved her so much , so truly. **25;6076;TOOLONG hoping that he and the owner of the voice could find their way out together , perhaps only hoping to give some comfort and receivesome in return . But the voice kept getting further and further away , dimmer and fainter ( far and wee ) until it was just an echo of an echo . And then it was gone . He was alone now , walking down this gloomy and deserted hall of shadows . And it began to seem to him that it was n't an illusion or a mirage or a dream  --  at least not of the ordinary kind . It was as if he had entered limbo , a weird conduit between the land of the living and that of the dead . But toward which end was he moving ? Things began to come back . Disturbing things . They were like ghosts that joined him on his walk , fell in on either side of him , in front of him , behind him , until they circled him in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and touch his eyes with holy dread , was that how it went ? He could almost see them . All the whispering voices of purgatory . There was a Wheel turning and turning in the night , a Wheel of the Future , red and black , life and death , slowing . Where had he laid his bet ? He could n't remember and he should be able to , because the stakes were his existence . In or out ? It had to be one or the other . His girl was sick . He had to get her home . After a while , the hallway began to seem brighter . At first he thought it was imagination , a sort of dream within a dream if that were possible , but after an unknown length of time the brightness be- ' ' came too marked to be an illusion . The whole experience of the corridorseemed to become less dreamlike . The walls drew back until he could barely see them , and the dull dark color changed to a sad and misty gray , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It began to seem that he was not in a hallway at all anymore , but in a room  --  almost in a room , separated from it by the thinnest of membranes , a sort of placental sac , like a baby waiting to be born . Now he heard other voices , not echoey but dull and thudding , like the voices of nameless gods speaking in forgotten tongues . Little by little these voices came clearer , until he could nearly make out what they were saying.  |p101He  began to open his eyes from time to time ( or thought he did ) and he could actually see the owners of those voices : bright , glowing , spectral shapes with no faces at first , sometimes moving about the room , sometimes bending over him . It did n't occur to him to try speaking to them , at least not at first . It came to him that this might be some sort of afterlife , and these bright shapes the shapes of angels . The faces , like the voices , began to come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaning into his field of vision and slowly thundering something totally without meaning into his upturned face . His father was there another time . Dave Pelsen from school . A nurse he came to know ; he believed her name was Mary or possibly Marie . Faces , voices , coming closer , jelling together . Something else crept in : a feeling that he had changed . He did n't like the feeling . He distrusted it . It seemed to him that whatever the change was , it was nothing good . It seemed to him that it meant sorrowand bad times . He had gone into the darkness with everything , and now it felt to him that he was coming out of it with nothing at all  --  except for some secret strangeness . The dream was ending . Whatever it had been , the dream was ending . The room was very real now , very close . The voices , the facesHe was going to come into the room . And it suddenly seemed to him that what he wanted to do was turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forever . The dark hallway was not good , but it was better than this new feeling of sadness and impending loss . He turned and looked behind him and yes , it was there , the place where the room 's walls changed to dark chrome , a corner beside one of the chairs where , unnoticed by the bright people who came and wcnt , the room became a passageway into what he now suspected was eternity . The place where that other voice had gone , the voice ofThe cab driver . Yes . That memory was all there now . The cab ride , the driver bemoaninghis son 's long hair , bemoaning the fact that his son thought Nixon was a pig . Then the headlights breasting the hill , a pair on each side of the white line . The crash . No pain , but the knowledge that his thighs had connected with the taximeter hard enough to rip it out ofp102its frame . There had been a sensation of cold wetness and then the dark hallway and now this . Choose , something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they 'll rip you out of this place , whatever and wherever it is , like doctors rippinga baby out of its mother 's womb by cesarian section . And then Sarah 's face came to him  --  she had to be out there someplace , although hers had not been one of the bright faces bending over his . She had to be out there , worried and scared . She was almost his , now . He felt that . He was going to ask her to marry him . That feeling of unease came back , stronger than ever , and this time it was all mixed up with Sarah . But wanting her was stronger , and he made his decision . He turned his back on the dark place , and when he looked back over his shoulder later on , it had disappeared ; there was nothing beside the chair but the smooth white wall of the room where he lay . Not long after he began to know where the room must be  --  it was a hospital room , of course . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ completely forgotten . But more important , more immediate , was the fact that he was John Smith , he had a girl named Sarah Bracknell , and he had been in a terrible car accident . He suspected that he must be very lucky to be alive , and he could only hope that all his original equipment was still there and still functioning . He might be in Cleaves Mills Community Hospital , but he guessed the EMMC was more likely . From the way he felt he guessed he had been here for some time  --  he might have been blacked out for as long as a week or ten days . It was time to get going again . Time to get going again . That was the thought in Johnny 's mind when things finally jelled all the way back together and he opened his eyes . It was May 17 , 1975 . Mr. Starret had long since gone home with standing orders to walk two miles a day and mend his high-cholesterol ways . Across the room was an old man engaged in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He slept the sleep of morphia , and the room was otherwise empty . It was 3:15 P.M. The TV screen was a drawn green shade . " Here I am , " Johnny Smith croaked to no one at all . He wasp103shocked 1 the weakness of his voice . There was no calendar in the room , and he had no way of knowing that he had been out of it fourand-a-halfyears . The nurse came in some forty minutes later . She went over to the old man in the other bed , changed his IV feed , went into the bathroom , and came out with a blue plastic pitcher . She watered the old man 's flowers . There were over half a dozen bouquets , and a score of get-well cards standing open on his table and windowsill . Johnny watched her perform this homey chore , feeling as yet no urge to try his voice again . She put the pitcher back and came over to Johnny 's bed . Going to turn my pillows , he thought . Their eyes met briefly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know I 'm awake . My eyes have been open before . It does n't mean anything to her . She put her hand on the back of his neck . It was cool and comfortingand Johnny knew she had three children and that the youngest had lost most of the sight in one eye last Fourth of July . A firecracker accident . The boy 's name was Mark . She lifted his head , flipped his pillow over , and settled him back . She started to turn away , adjusting her nylon uniform at the hips , and then turned back , puzzled . Belatedly thinking that there had been something new in his eyes , maybe . Something that had n't been there before . She glanced at him thoughtfully , started to turn away again , and he said , " Hello , Marie . " She froze , and he could hear an ivory click as her teeth came suddenlyand violently together . Her hand pressed against her chest just above the swell of her breasts . A small gold crucifix hung there . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I thought you looked different . How did you know my name ? " " I suppose I must have heard it . " It was hard to talk , terribly hard . His tongue was a sluggish worm , seemingly unlubricated by saliva . She nodded . " You 've been coming up for some time now . I 'd bettergo down to the nurses ' station and have Dr. Brown or Dr. Weizakpaged . They 'll want to know you 're back with us . " But she stayed ap104moment longer , looking at him with a frank fascination that made him uneasy . " Did I grow a third eye ? " he asked . She laughed nervously . " No ... of course not . Excuse me . " His eye caught on his own window ledge and his table pushed up against it . On the ledge was a faded African violet and a picture of Jesus Christ  --  it was the sort of picture of Jesus his mother favored , with Christ looking as if he was ready to bat clean-up for the New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature . Butthe picture was  --  yellow . Yellow and beginning to curl at the corners . Sudden fear dropped over him like a suffocating blanket . " Nurse ! " he called . " Nurse ! " In the doorway she turned back . " Where are my get-well cards ? " Suddenly it was hard for him to breathe . " That other guy 's got ... did n't anyone send me a card ? " She smiled , but it was forced . It was the smile of someone who is hiding something . Suddenly Johnny wanted her by his bed . He would reach out and touch her . If he could touch her , he would know what she was hiding . " I 'll have the doctor paged , " she said , and left before he could say anything else . He looked at the African violet , at the aging picture of Jesus , baffled and afraid . After a little while , he drifted off to sleep again . " He was awake , " Marie Michaud said . " He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answered . " I 'm not doubting you . If he woke up once , he 'll wake up again . Probably . It 's just a matter of . . . " Johnny moaned . His eyes opened . They were blank , half rolled up . Then he seemed to see Marie , and his eyes came into focus . He smiled a little . But his face was still slack , as if only his eyes were awake and the rest of him still slept . She had a sudden feeling that he was not looking at her but into her . " I think he 'll be okay , " Johnny said . " Once they clean that impactedcornea , the eye 'll be as good as new . Should be . " Marie gasped harshly , and Brown glanced at her . " What is it ? "  | " He 's talking about my boy , " she whispered . " My Mark . " " No , " Brown said . " He 's talking in his sleep , that 's all . Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Yes . Okay . But he 's not asleep now , is he ? " " Marie ? " Johnny asked . He smiled tentatively . " I dozed off , did n't I ? " " Yes , " Brown said . " You were talking in your sleep . Gave Marie here a turn . Were you dreaming ? " " No-oo ... not that I remember . What did I say ? And who are you ? " " I 'm Dr. James Brown . Just like the soul singer . Only I 'm a neurologist . You said , I think he 'll be okay once they clean that impacted cornea . ' I think that was it , was n't it , Nurse ? " " My boy 's going to have that operation , " Marie said . " My boy Mark . " " I do n't remember anything , " Johnny said . " I guess I was sleeping . " He looked at Brown . His eyes were clear now , and scared . " I ca n't lift @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Try your fingers . " Johnny did . They all wiggled . He smiled . " Superfine , " Brown said . " Tell me your name . " " John Smith . " " Good , and your middle name ? " " I do n't have one . " " That 's fine , who needs one ? Nurse , go down to your station and find out who 's in neurology tomorrow . I 'd like to start a whole series of tests on Mr. Smith . " " Yes , Doctor . " " And you might call Sam Weizak . You 'll get him at home or at the golf course . " " Yes , Doctor . " " And no reporters , please ... for your life ! " Brown was smiling but serious . " No , of course not . " She left , white shoes squeaking faintly . Her little boy 's going to be just fine , Johnny thought . I 'll be sure to tell her ,  | " Dr. Brown , " he said , " where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ card ? " " Just a few more questions , " Dr. Brown said smoothly . " Do you recall your mother 's name ? " " Of course I do . Vera . " " Her maiden name ? " " Nason . " " Your father 's name ? " " Herbert . Herb . And why did you tell her no reporters ? " " Your mailing address ? " " RFD #1 , Pownal , " Johnny said promptly , and then stopped . An expression of comic surprise passed across his face . " I mean ... well , I live in Cleaves Mills now , at 110 North Main Street . Why the hell did I give you my parents ' address ? I have n't lived there since I was eighteen . " " And how old are you now ? " " Look it up on my driver 's license , " Johnny said . " I want to know why I do n't have any get-well cards . How long have I been in the hospital , anyway ? And which hospital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Medical Center . And we 'll get to all the rest of your questions if you 'll just let me ... " Brown was sitting by the bed in a chair he had drawn over from the corner  --  the same corner where Johnny had once seen the passage leading away . He was making notes on a clipboard with a type of pen Johnny could n't remember ever having seen before . It had a thick blue plastic barrel and a fibrous tip . It looked like the strange hybrid of spring of a fountain pen and a ballpoint . Just looking at it made that formless dread come back , and without thinking about it , Johnny suddenly seized Dr. Brown 's left hand in one of his own . His arm moved creakily , as if there were invisible sixty-pound weights tied to it  --  a couple below the elbow and a couple above . He captured the doctor 's hand in a weak grip and pulled . The funny pen left a thick blue line across the paper . Brown looked at him , at first only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sharp expression of interest left his eyes and was replaced with a muddy look of fear . He snatched his hand away Johnny hadp107no power to hold it  --  and for an instant a look of revulsion crossed the doctor 's face , as if he had been touched by a leper . Then it was gone , and he only looked surprised and disconcerted . " What did you do that for ? Mr. Smith ... " His voice faltered . Johnny 's face had frozen in an expression of dawning comprehension . His eyes were the eyes of a man who has seen something terrible moving and shifting in the shadows , somethingtoo terrible to be described or even named . But it was a fact . It had to be named . " Fifty-five months ? " Johnny asked hoarsely . " Going on five years ? No . Oh my God , no . " " Mr. Smith , " Brown said , now totally flustered . " Please , it 's not good for you to excite ... " Johnny raised his upper body perhaps three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face shiny with sweat . His eyes rolled helplesslyin their sockets . " I 'm twenty-seven ? " he muttered . " Twentyseven ? Oh my Jesus . " Brown swallowed and heard an audible click . When Smith had grabbed his hand , he had felt a sudden onrush of bad feelings , childlikein their intensity ; crude images of revulsion had assaulted him . He had found himself remembering a picnic in the country when he had been seven or eight , sitting down and putting his hand in something warm and slippery . He had looked around and had seen that he had put his hand into the maggoty remains of a woodchuck that had lain under a laurel bush all that hot August . He had screamed then , and he felt a little bit like screaming now  --  except that the feeling was fading , dwindling , to be replaced with a question : How did he know ? He touched me and he knew . Then twenty years of education rose up strongly in him , and he pushed the notion aside . There were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dreamlike knowledge of many of the things that had gone on around them while they were in coma . like anything else , coma was a matter of degree . Johnny Smith had never been a vegetable ; his EEG had never gone flatline , and if it had , Brown would not be talking with him now . Sometimes being in a coma was a little like being behind a one-way glass . To the beholdingp108eye the patient was completely conked out , but the patient 's senses might still continue to function in some low , power-down fashion . And that was the case here , of course . Marie Michaud came back in . " Neurology is confirmed , and Dr. Weizak is on his way . " " I think Sam will have to wait until tomorrow to meet Mr. Smith , " Brown said . " I want him to have five milligrams of Valium . " " I do n't want a sedative , " Johnny said . " I want to get out of here . I want to know what happened ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " Right now it 's important that you rest . " " I 've been resting for four-and-a-half years ! " " Then another twelve hours wo n't make much difference , " Brown said inexorably . A few moments later the nurse swabbed his upper arm with alcohol , and there was the sting of a needle . Johnny began to feel sleepy almost at once . Brown and the nurse began to look twelve feet tall . " Tell me one thing , at least , " he said . His voice seemed to come from far , far away . Suddenly it seemed terribly important . " That pen . What do you call that pen ? " " This ? " Brown held it out from his amazing height . Blue plastic body , fibrous tip . " It 's called a Flair . Now go to sleep , Mr. Smith . " And Johnny did , but the word followed him down into his sleep like a mystic incantation , full of idiot meaning : Flair ... Flair ... Flair ... Herb put the telephone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a long time . From the other room came the sound of the TV , turned up almost all the way . Oral Roberts was talking about football and the healing love of Jesus  --  there was a connection there someplace , but Herb had missed it . Because of the telephone call . Oral 's voice boomed and roared . Pretty soon the show would end and Oral would close it out by confidently telling his audience that something good was going to happen to them . Apparently Oral was right . My boy , Herb thought . While Vera had prayed for a miracle , Herbp109had prayed for his boy to die . It was Vera 's prayer that had been answered . What did that mean , and where did it leave him ? And what was it going to do to her ? He went into the living room . Vera was sitting on the couch . Her feet , encased in elastic pink mules , were up on a hassock . She was wearing her old gray robe . She was eating popcorn straight from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on nearly forty pounds and her blood pressure had skyrocketed . The doctor wanted to put her on medication , but Vera would n't have it  --  if it was the will of the Lord for her to have the high blood , she said , then she would have it . Herb had once pointed out that the will of the Lord had never stopped her from taking Bufferin when she had a headache . She had answered with her sweetest long-suffering smile and her most potent weapon : silence . " Who was on the phone ? " she asked him , not looking away from the TV . Oral had his arm around the well-known quarterback of an NFC team . He was talking to a hushed multitude . The quarterback was smiling modestly. " ... and you have all heard this fine athlete tell you tonight how he abused his body , his Temple of God . And you have heard ... " Herb snapped it off " Herbert Smith ! " She nearly spilled her popcorn sitting up . " I was watching ! That was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oral Roberts and ... " The words snapped off in her mouth . She seemed to crouch back in her chair , as if he had taken a swing at her . He looked back , unable to say more , wanting to feel joy but afraid . So afraid . " Johnny 's ... " She stopped , swallowed , then tried again . " Johnny .. our Johnny ? " " Yes . He spoke with Dr. Brown for nearly fifteen minutes . Apparcntlyit was n't that thing they thought ... false-waking ... after all . He 's coherent . He can move . " ' Johnny 's awake ? " Her hands came up to her mouth . The popcorn popper , half-full , aid a slow dipsy-doodle off her lap and thumped to the rug , spillingp110popcorn everywhere . Her hands covered the lower half of her fact . Above them her eyes got wider and wider still until , for a dreadful second , Herb was afraid that they might fall out and dangle by their stalks . Then they closed . A tiny mewing sound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you all right ? " " 0 my God I thank You for Your will be done my Johnny You brought me my I knew You would , my Johnny , o dear God I will bring You my thanksgiving every day of my life for my Johnny Johnny JOHNNY  --  " Her voice was rising to an hysterical , triumphant scream . He stepped forward , grabbed the lapels of her robe , and shook her . Suddenly time seemed to have reversed , doubled back on itself like strange cloth  --  they might have been back on the night when the news of the accident came to them , delivered through that same telephone in that same nook . By nook or by crook , Herb Smith thought crazily. " 0 my precious God my Jesus oh my Johnny the miracle like I said the miracle ... " " Stop it , Vera ! " Her eyes were dark and hazy and hysterical . " Are you sorry he 's awake again ? After all these years of making fun of me ? Of telling people I was crazy ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crazy . " " You told them with your eyes ! " she shouted at him . " But my God was n't mocked . Was he , Herbert ? Was he ? " " No , " he said . " I guess not . " " I told you . I told you God had a plan for my Johnny . Now you see his hand beginning to work . " She got up . " I 've got to go to him . I 've got to tell him . " She walked toward the closet where her coat hung , seemingly unaware that she was in her robe and nightgown . Her face was stunned with rapture . In some bizarre and almost blasphemous way she reminded him of the way she had looked on the day they were married . Her pink mules crunched popcorn into the rug . " Vera . " " I 've got to tell him that God 's plan . . . " " Vera . "  |p111She  turned to him , but her eyes were far away , with her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on her shoulders . " You tell him that you love him ... that you prayed ... waited watched . Who has a better right ? You 're his mother . You bled for him . Have n't I watched you bleed for him over the last five years ? I 'm not sorry he 's back with us , you were wrong to say that . I do n't think I can make of it what you do , but I 'm not sorry . I bled for him , too . " " Did you ? " Her eyes were flinty , proud , and unbelieving . " Yes . And I 'm going to tell you something else , Vera . You 're going to keep your trap shut about God and miracles and Great Plans until Johnny 's up on his feet and able to ... " " I 'll say what I have to say ! " " ... and able to think what he 's doing . What I 'm saying is that you 're going to give him a chance to make something of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " You have no right to talk to me that way ! No right at all ! " " I 'm exercising my right as Johnny 's dad , " he said grimly . " Maybefor the last time in my life . And you better not get in my way , Vera . You understand ? Not you , not God , not the bleeding holy Jesus . Youfollow ? " She glared at him sullenly and said nothing . " He 's going to have enough to do just coping with the idea that he 's been out like a light for four-and-a-half years . We do n't know if he 'll be able to walk again , in spite of the therapist that came in . We do know there 'll have to be an operation on his ligaments , if he even wants to try ; Weizak told us that . Probably more than one . And more therapy , and a lot of it 's going to hurt him like hell . So tomorrow you 're just going to be his mother . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do n't you dare ! " " If you start in sermonizing , Vera , I 'll drag you out of his room by the hair of your head . " She stared at him , white-faced and trembling . Joy and fury were at war in her eyes . " You better get dressed , " Herb said . " We ought to get going . " It was a long , silent ride up to Bangor . The happiness they should have felt between them was not there ; only Vera 's hot and militantp112joy . She sat bolt upright in the passenger seat , her Bible in her lap , open to the twenty-third PsalmAt quarter of nine the next morning , Marie came into Johnny 's room and said , " Your mom and dad are here , if you 're up to seeing them . " " Yes , I 'd like that . " He felt much better this morning , stronger and less disoriented . But the thought of seeing them scared him a little . In terms of his conscious recollection , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been working on the foundation of a house that had now probably been standing for three years or more . His mom had fixed him home-baked beans and apple pie for dessert and had clucked over how thin he was getting . He caught Marie 's hand weakly as she turned to go . " Do they look all right ? I mean ... " " They look fine . " " Oh . Good . " " You can only have half an hour with them now . Some more time this evening if the neurology series does n't prove too tiring . " " Dr. Brown 's orders ? " " And Dr. Weizak 's . " " All right . For a while . I 'm not sure how long I want to be poked and prodded . " Marie hesitated . " Something ? " Johnny asked . " No ... not now . You must be anxious to see your folks . I 'll send them in . " He waited , nervous . The other bed was empty ; the cancer patient had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The door opened . His mother and father came in . Johnny felt simultaneousshock and relief : shock because they had aged , it was all true ; relief because the changes in them did not yet seem mortal . And if that could be said of them , perhaps it could be said of him as well . But something in him had changed , changed drastically  --  and it might be mortal.  |p113That  was all he had time to think before his mother 's arms were around him , her violet sachet strong in his nostrils , and she was whispering : " Thank God , Johnny , thank God , thank God you 're awake . " He hugged her back as best he could  --  his arms still had no power to grip and fell away quickly  --  and suddenly , in six seconds , he knew how it was with her , what she thought , and what was going to happen to her . Then it was gone , fading like that dream of the dark corridor . But when she broke the embrace to look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes had been replaced with one of thoughtful consideration . The words seemed to come out of him of their own : " Let them give you the medicine , Mom . That 's best . " Her eyes widened , she wet her lips-and then Herb was beside her , his eyes filled with tears . He had lost some weight  --  not as much as Vera had put on , but he was noticeably thinner . His hair was going fast but the face was the same , homely and plain and well-loved . He took a large brakeman 's bandanna from his back pocket and wiped his eyes with it . Then he stuck out his hand . " Hi , son , " he said . " Good to have you back . " Johnny shook his father 's hand as well as he could ; his pale and strengthless fingers were swallowed up in his father 's red hand . Johnny looked from one to the other  --  his mother in a bulky powder-blue pantsuit , his father in a really hideous houndstooth jacket that looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kansas  --  and he burst into tears . " I 'm sorry , " he said . " I 'm sorry , it 's just that ... " " You go on , " Vera said , sitting on the bed beside him . Her face was e aim and clear now . There was more mother than madness in it . " You go on and cry , sometimes that 's best . " And Johnny did . Herb told him his Aunt Germaine had died . Vera told him that the money for the Pownal Community Hall had finally been raised and the building had commenced a month ago , as soon as the frost wasp114out of the ground . Herb added that he had put in a bid , but he guessed honest work cost too dear for them to want to pay . " Oh , shush , you sore loser , " Vera said . There was a little silence and then Vera spoke again . " I hope you realize that your recovery is a miracle of God , Johnny . The doctors despaired . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Vera , " Herb said warningly . " Of course it was a miracle , Mom . I know that . " " You ... you do ? " " Yes . And I want to talk about it with you ... hear your ideas about what it means ... just as soon as I get on my feet again . " She was staring at him , open-mouthed . Johnny glanced past her at his father and their eyes met for a moment . Johnny saw great relief in his father 's eyes . Herb nodded imperceptibly . " A Conversion ! " Vera ejaculated loudly . " My boy has had a Conversion ! Oh , praise God ! " " Vera , hush , " Herb said . " Best to praise God in a lower voice when you 're in the hospital . " " I do n't see how anybody could not call it a miracle , Mom . And we 're going to talk about it a lot . Just as soon as I 'm out of here . " " You 're going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the house where you were raised . I 'll nurse you back to health and we 'll pray for understanding . " He was smiling at her , but holding the smile was an effort . " You bet . Mom , would you go down to the nurses ' station and ask Marie if I can have some juice ? Or maybe some ginger ale ? I guess I 'm not used to talking , and my throat ... " " Of course I will . " She kissed his cheek and stood up . " Oh , you 're so thin . But I 'll fix that when I get you home . " She left the room , casting a single victorious glance at Herb as she went . They heard hershoes tapping off down the hall . " How long has she been that way ? " Johnny asked quietly . Herb shook his head . " It 's come a little at a time since your accident . But it had its start long before that . You know . Youremember . " " Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There are people down South that handle snakes . I 'd call them crazy . She does n't do that . How are you , Johnny ? Really ? " " I do n't know , " Johnny said . " Daddy , where 's Sarah ? " Herb leaned forward and clasped his hands between his knees . " I do n't like to tell you this , John , but ... " " She 's married ? She got married ? " Herb did n't answer . Without looking directly at Johnny , he noddedhis head . " Oh , God , " Johnny said hollowly . " I was afraid of that . " " She 's been Mrs. Walter Hazlett for going on three years . He 's a lawyer . They have a baby boy . John ... no one really believed you were going to wake up . Except for your mother , of course . None of us had any reason to believe you would wake up . " His voice was tremblingnow , hoarse with guilt . " The doctors said ... ah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you up . I hate like hell to admit it , but it 's true . All I can ask you is try to understand about me ... and Sarah . " He tried to say that he did understand , but all that would come out was a sickly sort of croak . His body felt sick and old , and suddenly he was drowning in his sense of loss . The lost time was suddenly sitting on him like a load of bricks  --  a real thing , not just a vague concept . " Johnny , do n't take on . There are other things . Good things . " " It 's ... going to take some getting used to , " he managed . " Yeah . I know . " " Do you ever see her ? " " We write back and forth once in a while . We got acquainted after your accident . She 's a nice girl , real nice . She 's still teaching at Cleaves , but I understand she is getting done this June . She 's happy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thickly . " I 'm glad someone is . " " Son ... " " I hope you 're not telling secrets , " Vera Smith said brightly , cominghack into the room . She had an ice-clogged pitcher in one hand . " They said you were n't ready for fruit juice , Johnny , so I brought you floe ginger ale . " " That 's fine , Mom . " She looked from Herb to Johnny and back to Herb again . " Have you bcen telling secrets ? Why the long faces ? "  | " I was just telling Johnny he 's going to have to work hard if he wants to get out of here , " said Herb . " Lots of therapy . " " Now why would you want to talk about that now ? " She poured ginger ale into Johnny 's glass . " Everything 's going to be fine now . You 'll see . " She popped a flexible straw into the glass and handed it to him . " Now you drink all of it , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . " Johnny did drink all of it . It tasted bitter . " Close your eyes , " Dr. Weizak said . He was a small , roly-poly man with an incredible styled head of hair and spade sideburns . Johnny could n't get over all that hair . A man with a haircut like that in 1970 would have had to fight his way out of every bar in eastern Maine , and a man Weizak 's age would have been considered ripe for committal . All that hair . Man . He closed his eyes . His head was covered with electrical contact points . The contacts went to wires that fed into a wall-console EEG . Dr. Brown and a nurse stood by the console , which was calmly extrudinga wide sheet of graph paper . Johnny wished the nurse could have been Marie Michaud . He was a little scared . Dr. Weizak touched his eyelids and Johnny jerked . " Nuh ... hold still , Johnny . These are the last two . Just .. there . " " All right , Doctor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All right , Johnny . Are you comfortable ? " " Feels like there are pennies on my eyelids . " " Yes ? You 'll get used to that in no time . Now let me explain top117you this procedure . I am going to ask you to visualize a number of things . You will have about ten seconds on each , and there are twenty things to visualize in all . You understand ? " " Yes . " " Very fine . We begin . Dr. Brown ? " " All ready . " " Excellent . Johnny , I ask you to see a table . On this table there is an orange . " Johnny thought about it . He saw a small card-table with folding steel legs . Resting on it , a little off-center , was a large orange with the word SUNKIST stamped on its pocky skin . " Good , " Weizak said . " Can that gadget see my orange ? " " Nuh . . . well , yes ; in a symbolic way it can . The machine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Johnny . Areas of impairment . Possible indications of continuing intercranial pressure . Now I ask you to shush with the questions . " " All right . " " Now I ask you to see a television . It is on , but not receiving a station . " Johnny saw the TV that was in his apartment  --  had been in his apartment . The screen was bright gray with snow . The tips of the rabbitears were wrapped with tinfoil for better reception . " Good . " The series went on . For the eleventh item Weizak said , " Now I ask you to see a picnic table on the left side of a green lawn . " Johnny thought about it , and in his mind he saw a lawn chair . He frowned . " Something wrong ? " Weizak asked . " No , not at all , " Johnny said . He thought harder . Picnics . Weiners , a charcoal brazier . . . associate , dammit , associate . How hard can it be to see a picnic table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them in your life ; associate your way to it . Plastic spoons and forks , piper plates , his father in a chef 's hat , holding a long fork in one hand and wearing an apron with a motto printed across it in tipsy letters ,  |p118THE  COOK NEEDS A DRINK . His father making burgers and then they would all go sit at theAh , here it came ! Johnny smiled , and then the smile faded . This time the image in his mind was of a hammock . " Shit ! " " No picnic table ? " " It 's the weirdest thing . I ca n't quite ... seem to think of it . I mean , I know what it is , but I ca n't see it in my mind . Is that weird , or is that weird ? " " Never mind . Try this one : a globe of the world , sitting on the hood of a pickup truck . " That one was easy . On the nineteenth item , a rowboat lying at the foot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Johnny wondered ) , it happened again . It was frustrating . He saw a beachball lying beside a gravestone . He concentrated harder and saw a turnpike overpass . Weizak soothed him , and a few moments later the wires were removed from his head and eyelids . " Why could n't I see those things ? " he asked , his eyes moving from Weizak to Brown . " What 's the problem ? " " Hard to say with any real certainty , " Brown said . " It may be a kind of spot amnesia . Or it may be that the accident destroyed a small portion of your brain  --  and I mean a really microscopic bit . We do n't really know what the problem is , but it 's pretty obvious that you 've lost a number of trace memories . We happened to strike two . You 'll probably come across more . " Weizak said abruptly , " You sustained a head injury when you were a child , yes ? " Johnny looked at him doubtfully . " There is an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a theory , Johnny , backed by a good deal of statistical research ... " " Research that is nowhere near complete , " Brown said , almost primly . " That is true . But this theory supposes that the people who tend to recover from long-term coma are people who have sustained some sortp119of brain injury at a previous time ... it is as though the brain has made some adaptation as the result of the first injury that allows it to survive the second . " " It 's not proven , " Brown said . He seemed to disapprove of Weizak even bringing it up . " The scar is there , " Weizak said . " Can you not remember what happened to you , Johnny ? I would guess you must have blacked out . Did you fall down the stairs ? A bicycle accident , perhaps ? The scar says this happened to a young boy . " Johnny thought hard , then shook his head . " Have you asked my mom and dad ? " " Neither of them can remember any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ? " For a moment , something did  --  a memory of smoke , black and greasy and smelling like rubber . Cold . Then it was gone . Johnny shook his head . Weizak sighed , then shrugged . " You must be tired . " " Yes . A little bit . " Brown sat on the edge of the examination table . " It 's quarter of eleven . You 've worked hard this morning . Dr. Weizak and I will answer a few questions , if you like , then you go up to your room for a nap . Okay ? " " Okay , " Johnny said . " The pictures you took of my brain ... " " The CAT-scan , " Weizak nodded . " Computerized Axial Tomography . " He took a box of Chiclets and shook three of them into his mouth . " The CAT-scan is really a series of brain X-rays , Johnny . The computer highlights the pictures and . . . " " What did it tell you ? How long have I got ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Brown asked . " It sounds like a line from an old movie . " " I 've heard that people who come out of long-term comas do n't alwayslast so long , " Johnny said . " They lapse back . It 's like a light bulb going really bright before it burns out for good . " Weizak laughed hard . It was a hearty , bellowing laugh , and it was something of a wonder that he did n't choke on his gum . " Oh , suchp120melodrama . " He put a hand on Johnny 's chest . " You think Jim and I are babies in this field ? Nuh . We are neurologists . What you Americanscall high-priced talent . Which means we are only stupid about the functions of the human brain instead of out-and-out ignoramuses . So I tell you , yes , there have been lapse-backs . But you will not lapse . I think we can say that , Jim , yes , okay ? " " Yes , " Brown said . " We have n't been able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Johnny , there 's a guy in Texas who was in a coma for nine years . Now he 's a bank loan officer , and he 's been doing that job for six years . Before that he was a teller for two years . There 's a woman in Arizona who was down for twelve years . Somethingwent wrong with the anesthesia while she was in labor . Now she 's in a wheelchair , but she 's alive and aware . She came out of it in 1969 and met the baby she had delivered twelve years before . The baby was in the seventh grade and an honors student . " " Am I going to be in a wheelchair ? " Johnny asked . " I ca n't straighten my legs out . My arms are a little better , but my legs . . . " He trailed off , shaking his head . " The ligaments shorten , " Weizak said . " Yes ? That 's why comatose patients begin to pull into what we call the prefetal position . But we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than we used to , we are better at holding it of . You have been exercised regularly by the hospital physical therapist , even in your sleep . And different patients react to coma in different ways . Your deterioration has been quite slow , Johnny . As you say , your arms are remarkably responsiveand able . But there has been deterioration . Your therapy will be long and ... should I lie to you ? Nuh , I do n't think so . It will be long and painful . You will shed your tears . You may come to hate your therapist . You may come to fall in love with your bed . And there will be operations  --  only one if you are very , very lucky , but perhaps as many as four  --  to lengthen those ligaments . These operations are still new . They may succeed completely , partially , or not at all . And yet as God wills it , I believe you will walk again . I do n't believe you will ever ski or leap hurdles , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Thank you , " Johnny said . He felt a sudden wave of affection forp121this man with the accent and the strange haircut . He wanted to do something for Weizak in return  --  and with that feeling came the urge , almost the need , to touch him . He reached out suddenly and took Weizak 's hand in both of his own . The doctor 's hand was big , deeply lined , warm . " Yes ? " Weizak said kindly . " And what is this ? " And suddenly things changed . It was impossible to say how . Except that suddenly Weizak seemed very clear to him . Weizak seemed to .. . to stand forth , outlined in a lovely , clear light . Every mark and mole and line on Weizak 's face stood in relief . And every line told its own story . He began to understand . " I want your wallet , " Johnny said . " My . . . ? " Weizak and Brown exchanged a startled glance . " There 's a picture of your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Johnny said . " Please . " " How did you know that ? " " Please ! " Weizak looked into Johnny 's face for a moment , and then slowly dug under his smock and produced an old Lord Buxton , bulgy and out of shape . " How did you know I carry a picture of my mother ? She is dead , she died when the Nazis occupied Warsaw ... " Johnny snatched the wallet from Weizak 's hand . Both he and Brown looked stunned . Johnny opened it , dismissed the plastic picture-pockets , and dug in the back instead , his fingers hurrying past old business cards , receipted bills , a canceled check , an old ticket to some political function . He came up with a small snapshot that had been laminated in plastic . The picture showed a young woman , her features plain , her hair drawn back under a kerchief . Her smile was radiant and youthful . She held the hand of a young boy . Beside her was a man in the uniform of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and closed his eyes and for a moment there was darkness and then rushing out of the darkness came a wagon ... no , not a wagon , a hearse . A horse-drawn hearse . The lamps had been muffled in black sacking .

" You 're overexciting yourself , Johnny . " The voices came from far away , from a hallway in time . " He 's put himself in some kind of trance , " Weizak said . Hot in here . He was sweating . He was sweating because ( the city 's on fire , thousands are fleeing , a truck is roaring from side to side down a cobbled street , and the back of the truck is full of waving Berman soldiers in coal-scuttle helmets and the young woman is not smiling now , she is fleeing , no reason not to flee . the child has been sent away to safety and now the truck jumps the curb , the mudguard strikes her , shattering her hip and sending her flying through a plateglass window and into a dock shop and everything begins to chime . chime because of the time . the chime time is ) " Six o'clock , " Johnny said thickly . His eyes had rolled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1939 , and all the cuckoo birds are singing . " " Oh my God , what is it we have ? " Weizak whispered . The nurse had backed up against the EEG console , her face pale and scared . Everyoneis scared now because death is in the air . It 's always in the air in this place , this ( hospital. smell of ether . they 're screaming in the place of death . poland is dead , poland has fallen before the lightning warfare wehrmacht blitzkreig. shattered hip . the man in the next bed calling for water , calling , calling , calling . she remembers " THE BOY IS SAFE .

" " We have to put a stop to this , " Brown repeated.  | " How do you suggest we do that ? " Weizak asked , his voice brittle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Voices fading . The voices are under the clouds .

Then gibberish in song came from his mouth . " What in the name of God . . . " Brown began . " Polish , it is Polish ! " Weizak cried . His eyes were bulging , his face pale . " It is a cradle song and it is in Polish , my God , my Christ , what is it we have here ? " Weizak leaned forward as if to cross the years with Johnny , as if to leap them , as if to ( bridge , a bridge , it 's in turkey . then a bridge somewhere hot in the far east , is it Laos ? ca n't tell , lost a man there , we lost HANS there , then a bridge in virginia , a bridge over the RAPPAHANNOCK RIVER and anotherbridge in california . we are applying for citizenship now and we go to classes in a hot little room in the back of a post-office where it always smells of glue . it is 1963 , november , and when we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the little boy salutes his father 's coffin she thinks " THE BOY IS SAFE " and it brings back memories of some burning , some great burning and sorrow , what boy ? she dreams about the boy , it makes her head hurt . and the man dies , HELMUT BORENTZ dies and she and the childrenlive in camel california . in a house on . on . on . ca n't see the street sign , it 's in the dead zone , like the rowboat , like the picnic table on the lawn . it 's in the dead zone . like warsaw . the children go away , she goes to their gradua/tion ceremonies one by one , and her hip hurts . one dies in vietnam . the rest of them are fine . one of them is building bridges . her name is JOHANNA BORENTZ and late at night alone now she sometimes thinks in the ticking darkness : " THE BOY IS SAFE . " ) Johnny looked up at them . His head felt strange . That peculiar light around Weizak had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a little pukey . He looked at the picture in his hands for a moment and then handed it back . " Johnny ? " Brown said . " Are you all right ? " " Tired , " he muttered . " Can you tell us what happened to you ? " He looked at Weizak . " Your mother is alive , " he said . " No , Johnny . She died many years ago . In the war . " " A German trooptruck knocked her through a plate-glass show window and into a clock shop , " Johnny said . " She woke up in a hospitalwith amnesia . She had no identification , no papers . She took the name Johanna ... somebody . I did n't get that , but when the war was over she went to Switzerland and married a Swiss . . . engineer , I think . His specialty was building bridges , and his name was Helmut Borentz . So her married name was  --  is  --  Johanna Borentz . " The nurse 's eyes were getting bigger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either because he had decided Johnny was having them all on or perhaps just because he did n't like to see his neat schedule of tests disrupted . But Weizak 's face was still and thoughtful . " She and Helmut Borentz had four children , " Johnny said in that same , calm , washed-out voice . " His job took him all over the world . He was in Turkey for a while . Somewhere in the Far East , Laos , I think , maybe Cambodia . Then he came here . Virginia first , then some other places I did n't get , finally California . He and Johanna became U.S. citizens . Helmut Borentz is dead . One of the children they had is also dead . The others are alive and fine . But she dreams about you sometimes . And in the dreams she thinks , the boy is safe . ' But she does n't remember your name . Maybe she thinks it 's too late . " " California ? " Weizak said thoughtfully . " Sam , " Dr. Brown said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "  | " Where in California , John ? " " Carmel . By the sea . But I could n't tell which street . It was there , but I could n't tell . It was in a dead zone . Like the picnic table and the rowboat . But she 's in Carmel , California . Johanna Borentz . She 's not old . " " No , of course she would not be old , " Sam Weizak said in that same thoughtful , distant tone . " She was only twenty-four when the Germans invaded Poland . " " Dr. Weizak , I have to insist , " Brown said harshly . Weizak seemed to come out of a deep study . He looked around as if noticing his younger colleague for the first time . " Of course , " he said . " Of course you must . And John has had his question-and-answer period ... although I believe he has told us more than we have told him . " " That 's nonsense , " Brown said curtly , and Johnny thought : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brown , and then at the nurse . She was eyeing Johnny as if he were a tiger in a poorly built cage . " Do n't talk about this , Nurse . Not to your supervisor , your mother , your brother , your lover , or your priest . Understood ? " " Yes , Doctor , " the nurse said . But she 'll talk , Johnny thought , and then glanced at Weizak . And he knows it . He slept most of the afternoon . Around four P.M. he was rolled down the corridor to the elevator , taken down to neurology , and there were more tests . Johnny cried . He seemed to have very little control over the functions adults are supposed to be able to control . On his way back up , he urinated on himself and had to be changed like a baby . The first ( but far from the last ) wave of deep depression washed over him , carried him limply away , and he wished himself dead . Self-pity accompanied the depression and he thought how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Winkle . He could n't walk . His girl had married another man and his mother was in the grip of a religious mania . He could n't see anything ahead that looked worth living for.  |p126Back  in his room , the nurse asked him if he would like anything . If Marie had been on duty , Johnny would have asked for ice water . But she had gone off at three . " No , " he said , and rolled over to face the wall . After a little while , he slept . His father and mother came in for an hour that evening , and Vera left a bundle of tracts . " We 're going to stay until the end of the week , " Herb said , " and then , if you 're still doing fine , we 'll be going back to Pownal for a while . But we 'll be back up every weekend . " " I want to stay with my boy , " Vera said loudly . " It 's best that you do n't , Mom , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit , but he remembered how black it had been . If his mother started to talk about God 's wonderful plan for him while he was in that state , he doubted if he would be able to hold back his cackles of hysterical laughter . " You need me , John . You need me to explain ... " " First I need to get well , " Johnny said . " You can explain after I can walk . Okay ? " She did n't answer . There was an almost comically stubborn expression on her face  --  except there was nothing very funny about it . Nothing at all . Nothing but a quirk of fate , that 's all . Five minutes earlier or later on that road could have changed everything . Now look at us , all of us fucked over royally . And she believes it 's God 's plan . It 's either that or go completely crazy , I suppose . To break the awkward silence , Johnny said : " Well , did Nixon get reelected , dad ? Who ran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Herb said . " He ran against McGovern . " " Who ? "  | " McGovern . George McGovern . Senator from South Dakota . " " Not Muskie ? " " No . But Nixon 's not president anymore . He resigned . " " What ? " " He was a liar , " Vera said dourly . " He became swollen with pride and the Lord brought him low . " " Nixon resigned ? " Johnny was flabbergasted . " Him ? " " It was either quit or be fired , " Herb said . " They were getting ready to impeach him . " Johnny suddenly realized that there had been some great and fundamentalupheaval in American politics  --  almost surely as a result of the war in Vietnam  --  and he had missed it . For the first time he really felt like Rip van Winkle . How much had things changed ? He was almost afraid to Isk . Then a really chilling thought occurred . " Agnew ... Agnew 's president ? " " Ford , " Vera said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is president of the United States ? " " Not Henry , " she said . " Jerry . " He stared from one to the other , more than half convinced that all this was a dream or a bizarre joke . " Agnew resigned , too , " Vera said . Her lips were pressed thin and white . " He was a thief . He accepted a bribe right in his office . That 's what they say . " " He did n't resign over the bribe , " Herb said . " He resigned over some mess back in Maryland . He was up to his neck in it , I guess . Nixon nominated Jerry Ford to become vice president . Then Nixon resigned last August and Ford took over . He nominated Nelson Rockefeller to be vice president . And that 's where we are now . " " A divorced man , " Vera said grimly . " God forbid he ever becomes the president . " " What did Nixon do ? " Johnny asked . " Jesus Christ , I ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clouded instantly . " I mean , holy crow , if they were going to impeach him ... " " You need n't take the Savior 's name in vain over a bunch of crooked politicians , " Vera said . " It was Watergate . "  | " Watergate ? Was that an operation in Vietnam ? Something like that ? " " The Watergate Hotel in Washington , " Herb said . " Some Cuhans broke into the offices of the Democratic Committee there and got caught . Nixon knew about it . He tried to cover it up . " " Are you kidding ? " Johnny managed at last . " It was the tapes , " Vera said . " And that John Dean . Nothing but a rat deserting a sinking ship , that 's what I think . A common tattle-tale . " " Daddy , can you explain this to me ? " " I 'll try , " Herb said , " but I do n't think the whole story has come out , even yet . And I 'll bring you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on it already , and I guess there 'll be a million more before it 's finally done . Just before the election , in the summer of 1972 ... " It was ten-thirty and his parents were gone . The lights on the ward had been dimmed . Johnny could n't sleep . It was all dancing around in his head , a frightening jumble of new input . The world had changed more resoundingly than he would have believed possible in so short a time . He felt out of step and out of tune . Gas prices had gone up nearly a hundred percent , his father had told him . At the time of his accident , you could buy regular gas for thirty or thirty-two cents a gallon . Now it was fifty-four cents and sometimes there were lines at the pumps . The legal speed limit all over the country was fifty-five miles an hour and the long-haul truckers had almost revolted over that . But all of that was nothing . Vietnam was over . It had ended . The country had finally gone Communist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to show signs that he might come out of his coma . After all those years and all that bloodshed , the heirs of Uncle Ho had rolled up the country like a windowshade in a matter of days . The president of the United States had been to Red China . Not Ford , but Nixon . He had gone before he resigned . Nixon , of all peo/ple , the old witch-hunter himself . If anyone but his dad had told him that , Johnny would have flatly refused to believe . It was all too much , it was too scary . Suddenly he did n't want to know any more , for fear it might drive him totally crazy . That pen Dr. Brown had had , that Flair  --  how many other things were there like that ? How many hundreds of little things , all of them making the point over and over again : You lost part of your life , almost six percent , if the actuarial tables are to be believed . You 're behind the times . You missed out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Are you asleep , John ? " He turned over . A dim silhouette stood in his doorway . A small man with rounded shoulders . It was Weizak . " No . I 'm awake . " " I hoped so . May I come in ? " " Yes . Please do . " Weizak looked older tonight . He sat by Johnny 's bed . " I was on the phone earlier , " he said . " I called directory assistance for Carmel , California . I asked for a Mrs. Johanna Borentz . Do you think there was such a number ? " " Unless it 's unlisted or she does n't have a phone at all , " Johnny said . " She has a phone . I was given the number . " " Ah , " Johnny said . He was interested because he liked Weizak , but that was all . He felt no need to have his knowledge of Johanna Borentz validated , because he knew it was valid knowledge  --  he knew it the same way he knew he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought about it , " Weizak said . " I told you my mother was dead , but that was really only an assumption . My father died in the defense of Warsaw . My mother simply never turned up , nuh ? It was logical to assume that she had been killed in the shelling ... during the occupation ... you understand . She never turned up , so it was logical to assume that . Amnesia ... as a neurologistI can tell you that permanent , general amnesia is very , very rare . Probably rarer than true schizophrenia . I have never read of a documentedcase lasting thirty-five years . "  | " She recovered from her amnesia long ago , " Johnny said . " I think she simply blocked everything out . When her memory did come back , she had remarried and was the mother of two children ... possibly three . Remembering became a guilt trip , maybe . But she dreams of you . The boy is safe . ' Did you call her ? " " Yes , " Weizak said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could do that now ? Yes . It is a great convenience . You dial one , the area code , the number . Eleven digits and you can be in touch with any place in the country . It is an amazing thing . In some ways a frightening thing . A boy  --  no , a young man  --  answered the telephone . I asked if Mrs. Borentz was at home . I heard him call , Mom , it 's for you . ' Clunk went the receiver on the table or desk or whatever . I stood in Bangor , Maine , not forty miles from the Atlantic Ocean and listened to a young man put the phone down on a table in a town on the Pacific Ocean . My heart ... it was pounding so hard it frightened me . The wait seemed long . Then she picked up the phone and said , Yes ? Hello ? ' " " What did you say ? How did you handle it ? " " I did not , as you say , handle it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hung up the telephone . And I wished for a strong drink , but I did not have one . " " Are you satisfied it was her ? " " John , what a naive question ! I was nine years old in 1939 . I had not heard my mother 's voice since then . She spoke only Polish when I knew her . I speak only English now ... I have forgotten much of my native language , which is a shameful thing . How could I be satisfied one way or the other ? " " Yes , but were you ? " Weizak scrubbed a hand slowly across his forehead . " Yes , " he said . " It was her . It was my mother . " " But you could n't talk to her ? " " Why should I ? " Weizak asked , sounding almost angry . " Her life is her life , nuh ? It is as you said . The boy is safe . Should I upset a woman that is just coming into her years of peace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forever ? Those feelings of guilt you mentioned ... should I set them free ? Or even run the risk of so doing ? "  | " I do n't know , " Johnny said . They were troublesome questions , and the answers were beyond him  --  but he felt that Weizak was trying to say something about what he had done by articulating the questions . The questions he could not answer . " The boy is safe , the woman is safe in Carmel . The country is between them , and we let that be . But what about you , John ? What are we going to do about you ? " " I do n't understand what you mean . " " I will spell it out for you then , nuh ? Dr. Brown is angry . He is angry at me , angry at you , and angry at himself , I suspect , for half-believingsomething he has been sure is total poppycock for his whole life . The nurse who was a witness will never keep her silence . She will tell her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but her husbandmay tell his boss , and it is very possible that the papers will have wind of this by tomorrow evening . Coma Patient Re-Awakens with Second Sight . ' " " Second sight , " Johnny said . " Is that what it is ? " " I do n't know what it is , not really . Is it psychic ? Seer ? Handy words that describe nothing , nothing at all . You told one of the nurses that her son 's optic surgery was going to be successful . . . " " Marie , " Johnny murmured . He smiled a little . He liked Marie. " ... and that is already all over the hospital . Did you see the future ? Is that what second sight is ? I do n't know . You put a picture of my mother between your hands and were able to tell me where she lives today . Do you know where lost things and lost people may be found ? Is that what second sight is ? I do n't know . Can you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Heal by the laying on of hands ? These are all things that some call psychic . ' They are all related to the idea of second sight . ' They are things that Dr. Brown laughs at . Laughs ? No . He does n't laugh . He scoffs . " " And you do n't ? " " I think of Edgar Cayce . And Peter Hurkos . I tried to tell Dr. Brown about Hurkos and he scoffed . He does n't want to talk about it ; he does n't want to know about it . " Johnny said nothing . " So ... what are we going to do about you ? "  | " Does something need to be done ? " " I think so , " Weizak said . He stood up . " I 'll leave you to think it out for yourself . But when you think , think about this : some things are better not seen , and some things are better lost than found . " He bade Johnny good night and left quietly . Johnny was very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a long time . Johnny 's first surgery was scheduled for May 28 . Both Weizak and Brown had explained the procedure carefully to him . He would be given a local anesthetic  --  neither of them felt a general could be risked . This first operation would be on his knees and ankles . His own ligaments , which had shortened during his long sleep , would be lengthened with a combination of plastic wonder-fibers . The plastic to be used was also employed in heart valve bypass surgery . The question was not so much one of his body 's acceptance or rejection of the artificialligaments , Brown told him , as it was a question of his legs ' ability to adjust to the change . If they had good results with the knees and the ankles , three more operations were on the boards : one on the long ligaments of his thighs , one on the elbow-strap ligaments , and possibly a third on his neck , which he could barely turn at all . The surgery was to be performed by Raymond Ruopp , who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Francisco . " What does this guy Ruopp want with me , if he 's such a superstar ? " Johnny asked . Superstar was a word he had learned from Marie . She had used it in connection with a balding , bespectacled singer with the unlikely name of Elton John . " You 're underestimating your own superstar qualities , " Brown answered . " There are only a handful of people in the United States who have recovered from comas as long as yours was . And of that handful ,  |p133your  recovery from the accompanying brain damage has been the most radical and pleasing . " Sam Weizak was more blunt . " You 're a guinea pig , nuh ? " " What ? " " Yes . Look into the light , please . " Weizak shone a light into the pupil of Johnny 's left eye . " Did you know I can look right at your optic nerve with this thing ? Yes . The eyes are more than the windows of the soul . They are one of the brain 's most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Johnny said morosely , staring into the savage point of light . " Yes . " The light snapped off " Do n't feel so sorry for yourself . Many of the techniques to be employed in your behalf  --  and some of those already employed  --  were perfected during the Vietnam war . No shortage of guinea pigs in the V.A . hospitals , nuh ? A man like Ruopp is interested in you because you are unique . Here is a man who has slept four-and-a-half years . Can we make him walk again ? An interestingproblem . He sees the monograph he will write on it for The New England Journal of Medicine . He looks forward to it the way a child looks forward to new toys under the Christmas tree . He does not see you , he does not see Johnny Smith in his pain , Johnny Smith who must take the bedpan and ring for the nurse to scratch if his back itches . That 's good . His hands will not shake . Smile , Johnny . This Ruopp looks like a bank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ North America . " But it was hard for Johnny to smile . He had read his way dutifully through the tracts his mother had left him . They depressed him and left him frightened all over again for her sanity . One of them , by a man named Salem Kirban , struck him as nearly pagan in its loving contemplation of a bloody apocalypseand the yawning barbecue pits of hell . Another described the coming Antichrist in pulp-horror terms . The others were a dark carnivalof craziness : Christ was living under the South Pole , God drove flying saucers , New York was Sodom , L.A. was Gomorrah . They dealt with exorcism , with witches , with all manner of things seen and un/seen . It was impossible for him to reconcile the pamphlets with the religious yet earthy woman he had known before his coma . Three days after the incident involving Weizak 's snapshot of his mother , a slim and dark-haired reporter from the Bangor Daily News named David Bright showed up at the door of Johnny 's room and asked if he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctors ? " Johnny asked . Bright grinned . " Actually , no . " " All right , " Johnny said . " In that case , I 'd be happy to talk to you . " " You 're a man after my own heart , " Bright said . He came in and sat down . His first questions were about the accident and about Johnny 's thoughts and feelings upon slipping out of the coma and discovering he had misplaced nearly half a decade . Johnny answered these questionshonestly and straightforwardly . Then Bright told him that he had heard from " a source " that Johnny had gained some sort of sixth sense as a result of the accident . " Are you asking me if I 'm psychic ? " Bright smiled and shrugged . " That 'll do for a start . " Johnny had thought carefully about the things Weizak had said . The more he thought , the more it seemed to him that Weizak had done exactly the right thing when he hung up the phone without saying anything . Johnny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ W. W. Jacobs story , " The Monkey 's Paw . " The paw was for wishing , but the price you paid for each of your three wishes was a black one . The old couple had wished for one hundred pounds and had lost their son in a mill accident  --  the mill 's compensation had come to exactly one hundred pounds . Then the old woman had wished for her son back and he had come  --  but before she could open the door and see what a horror she had summoned out of its grave , the old man had used the last wish to send it back . As Weizak had said , maybe some things were better lost than found . " No , " he said . " I 'm no more psychic than you are . " " According to my source , you ... " " No , it is n't true . " Bright smiled a trifle cynically , seemed to debate pressing the matterp135further , then turned to a fresh page in his notebook . He began to ask about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the road back , and Johnny also answered these questions as honestly as he could . " So what are you going to do when you get out of here ? " Bright asked , closing his notebook . " I have n't really thought about that . I 'm still trying to adjust to the idea that Gerald Ford is the president . " Bright laughed . " You 're not alone in that , my friend . " " I suppose I 'll go back to teaching . It 's all I know . But right now that 's too far ahead to think about . " Bright thanked him for the interview and left . The article appeared in the paper two days later , the day before his leg surgery . It was on the bottom of the front page , and the headline read : JOHN SMITH , MODERN RIP VAN WINKLE , FACES LONG ROAD BACK . There were three pictures , one of them Johnny 's picture for the Cleaves Mills High School yearbook ( it had been taken barely a week before the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed , looking thin and twisted with his arms and legs in their bent positions . Betweenthese two was a picture of the almost totally demolished taxi , lying on its side like a dead dog . There was no mention in Bright 's article of sixth senses , precognitive powers , or wild talents . " How did you turn him off the ESP angle ? " Weizak asked him that evening . Johnny shrugged . " He seemed like a nice guy . Maybe he did n't want to stick me with it . " " Maybe not , " Weizak said . " But he wo n't forget it . Not if he 's a good reporter , and I understand that he is . " " You understand ? " " I asked around . " " Looking out for my best interests ? " " We all do what we can , nuh ? Are you nervous about tomorrow , Johnny ? " " Not nervous , no . Scared is a more accurate word . " " Yes , of course you are . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "  | " Yes , in the observation section of the operating theater . Above . You wo n't be able to tell me from the others in my greens , but I will be there . " " Wear something , " Johnny said . " Wear something so I 'll know it 's you. , , Weizak looked at him , and smiled . " All right . I 'll pin my watch to my tunic . " " Good , " Johnny said . " What about Dr. Brown ? Will he be there ? " " Dr. Brown is in Washington . Tomorrow he will present you to the American Society of Neurologists . I have read his paper . It is quite good . Perhaps overstated . " " You were n't invited ? " Weizak shrugged . " I do n't like to fly . That is something that scares me . " " And maybe you wanted to stay here ? " Weizak smiled crookedly , spread his hands , and said nothing . " He does n't like me much , does he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No , not much , " Weizak said . " He thinks you are having us on . Making things up for some reason of your own . Seeking attention , perhaps . Do n't judge him solely on that , John . His cast of mind makes it impossible for him to think otherwise . If you feel anything for Jim , feel a little pity . He is a brilliant man , and he will go far . Alreadyhe has offers , and someday soon he will fly from these cold north woods and Bangor will see him no more . He will go to Houston or Hawaii or possibly even to Paris . But he is curiously limited . He is a mechanic of the brain . He has cut it to pieces with his scalpel and found no soul . Therefore there is none . Like the Russian astronauts who circled the earth and did not see God . It is the empiricism of the mechanic , and a mechanic is only a child with superior motor control . You must never tell him I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you must rest . Tomorrow you have a long day . " All Johnny saw of the world-famous Dr. Ruopp during the operation was a pair of thick horn-rimmed glasses and a large wen at the extremep137left side of the man 's forehead . The rest of him was capped , gowned , and gloved . Johnny had been given two preop injections , one of demerol and one of atropine , and when he was wheeled in he was as high as a kite . The anesthetist approached with the biggest novocaine needle Johnny had ever seen in his life . He expected that the injection would hurt , and he was not wrong . He was injected between L4 and L5 , the fourth and fifth lumbar vertebrae , high enough up to avoid the cauda equina , that bundle of nerves at the base of the spine that vaguely resembles a horse 's tail . Johnny lay on his stomach and bit his arm to keep from screaming . After an endless time , the pain began to fade to a dull sensation of pressure . Otherwise , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ruopp 's face loomed over him . The green bandit , Johnny thought . Jesse James in horn-rims . Your money or your life . " Are you comfortable , Mr. Smith ? " Ruopp asked . " Yes . But I 'd just as soon not go through that again . " " You may read magazines , if you like . Or you may watch in the mirror , if you feel it will not upset you . " " All right . " " Nurse , give me a blood pressure , please . " " One-twenty over seventy-six , Doctor . " " That 's lovely . Well , group , shall we begin ? " " Save me a drumstick , " Johnny said weakly , and was surprised by the hearty laughter . Ruopp patted his sheet-covered shoulder with one thinly gloved hand . He watched Ruopp select a scalpel and disappear behind the green drapes hung over the metal hoop that curved above Johnny . The mirrorwas convex , and Johnny had a fairly good if slightly distorted view of everything . " Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dee-de-dee . . . here 's what we want ... hum-de-dum ... okay . . . clamp , please , Nurse , come on , wake up for Christ 's sake ... yes sir ... now I believe I 'd like one of those .. . no , hold it ... do n't give me what I ask for , give me what I need .. . yes , okay . Strap , please . " With forceps , the nurse handed Ruopp something that looked likep138a bundle of thin wires twisted together . Ruopp picked them delicately out of the air with tweezers . Like an Italian dinner , Johnny thought , and look at all that spaghetti sauce . That was what made him feel ill , and he looked away . Above him , in the gallery , the rest of the bandit gang looked down at him . Their eyes looked pale and merciless and frightening . Then he spotted Weizak , third from the right , his watch pinned neatly to the front of his gown . Johnny nodded . Weizak nodded back . That made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his knees and calves , and Johnny was turned over . Things continued . The anesthesiologist asked him if he felt all right . Johnny told her he thought he felt as well as possible under the circumstances . She asked him if he would like to listen to a tape and he said that would be very nice . A few momentslater the clear , sweet voice of Joan Baez filled the operating room . Ruopp did his thing . Johnny grew sleepy and dozed off When he woke up the operation was still going on . Weizak was still there . Johnny raised one hand , acknowledging his presence , and Weizak nodded again . An hour later it was done . He was wheeled into a recovery room where a nurse kept asking him if he could tell her how many of his toes she was touching . After a while , Johnny could . Ruopp came in , his bandit 's mask hanging off to one side . " All right ? " he asked . " It went very well , " Ruopp said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 'll have some pain , " Ruopp said . " Quite a lot of it , perhaps . The therapy itself will give you a lot of pain at first . Stick with it . " " Stick with it , " Johnny muttered  | " Good afternoon , " Ruopp said , and left . Probably , Johnny thought , to play a quick nine on the local golf course before it got too dark . Quite a lot of pain . By nine P.M. the last of the local had worn off , and Johnny was in agony . He was forbidden to move his legs without the help of two nurses . It felt as if nail-studded belts had been looped around his knees and then cinched cruelly tight . Time slowed to an inchworm 's crawl . He would glance at his watch , sure that an hour had passed since the last time he had looked at it , and would see instead that it had only been four minutes . He became sure he could n't stand the pain for another minute , then the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't stand it for another minute . He thought of all the minutes stacked up ahead , like coins in a slot five miles high , and the blackest depression he had ever known swept over him in a smooth solid wave and carried him down . They were going to torture him to death . Operations on his elbows , thighs , his neck . Therapy . Walkers , wheelchairs , canes . You 're going to have pain . . . stick with it . No , you stick with it , Johnny thought . just leave me alone . Do n't come near me again with your butchers ' knives . If this is your idea of helping , I want no part of it . Steady throbbing pain , digging into the meat of him . Warmth on his belly , trickling . He had wet himself . Johnny Smith turned his face toward the wall and cried . Ten days after that first operation and two weeks before the next one was scheduled , Johnny looked up from the book he was reading  --  Woodward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw Sarah standing in the doorway , looking at him hesitantly . " Sarah , " he said . " It is you , is n't it ? " Shc let out her breath shakily . " Yes . It 's me , Johnny . " He put the book down and looked at her . She was smartly dressedp140in a light-green linen dress , and she held a small , brown clutch bag in front of her like a shield . She had put a streak in her hair and it looked good . It also made him feel a sharp and twisting stab of jealousy  --  had it been her idea , or that of the man she lived and slept with ? She was beautiful . " Come in , " he said . " Come in and sit down . " She crossed the room and suddenly he saw himself as she must see him  --  too thin , his body slumped a little to one side in the chair by the window , his legs stuck out straight on the hassock , dressed in a johnny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see , I put on my tux , " he said . " You look fine . " She kissed his cheek and a hundred memories shuffled brightly through his mind like a doubled pack of cards . She sat in the other chair , crossed her legs , and tugged at the hem of her dress . They looked at each other without saying anything . He saw that she was very nervous . If someone were to touch her on the shoulder , she would probably spring right out of her seat . " I did n't know if I should come , " she said , " but I really wanted to . " " I 'm glad you did . " Like strangers on a bus , he thought dismally . It 's got to be more than this , does n't it ? " So how 're you doing ? " she asked . He smiled . " I 've been in the war . Want to see my battle scars ? " He raised his gown over his knees , showing the S-shaped incisions that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hashmarked with stitches . " Oh , my Lord , what are they doing to you ? " " They 're trying to put Humpty Dumpty back together again , " Johnny said . " All the king 's horses , all the king 's men , and all the king 's doctors . So I guess . . . " And then he stopped , because she was crying . " Do n't say it like that , Johnny , " she said . " Please do n't say it like that . " " I 'm sorry . It was just . . . I was trying to joke about it . " Was thatp141it ? Had he been trying to laugh it off or had it been a way of saying , Thanks for coming to see me , they 're cutting me to pieces ? " Can you ? Can you joke about it ? " She had gotten a Kleenex from the clutch bag and was wiping her eyes with it . " Not very often . I guess seeing you again ... the defenses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to let you out of here ? " " Eventually . It 's like running the gauntlet in the old days , did you ever read about that ? If I 'm still alive after every Indian in the tribe has had a swing at me with his tomahawk , I get to go free . " " This summer ? " " No , I ... I do n't think so . " " I 'm so sorry it happened , " she said , so low he could barely hear her . " I try to figure out why ... or how things could have been changed ... and it just robs me of sleep . If I had n't eaten that bad hot dog .. . if you had stayed instead of going back . . . " She shook her head and looked at him , her eyes red . " It seems sometimes there 's no percentage . " Johnny smiled . " Double zero . House spin . Hey , you remember that ? I clobbered that Wheel , Sarah . " " Yes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at her , still smiling , but now the smile was puzzled , wounded almost . " You want to know something funny ? My doctors chink maybe the reason I lived was because I had some sort of head injury when I was young . But I could n't remember any , and neither could my mom and dad . But it seems like every time I think of it , I flash on that Wheel of Fortune ... and a smell like burning rubber . " " Maybe you were in a car accident . . . " she began doubtfully . " No , I do n't think that 's it . But it 's like the Wheel was my warning ... and I ignored it . " She shifted a little and said uneasily , " Do n't , Johnny . " He shrugged . " Or maybe it was just that I used up four years ofluck in one evening . But look at this , Sarah . " Carefully , painfully , hetook one leg off the hassock , bent it to a ninety-degree angle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maybe they can put Humptyp142back together again . When I woke up , I could n't do that , and I could n't get my legs to straighten out as much as they are now , either . " " And you can think , Johnny , " she said . " You can talk . We all thought that ... you know . " " Yeah , Johnny the turnip . " A silence fell between them again , awkwardand heavy . Johnny broke it by saying with forced brightness , " So how 's by you ? " " Well .. . I 'm married . I guess you knew that . " " Dad told me . " " He 's such a fine man , " Sarah said . And then , in a burst , " I could n't wait , Johnny . I 'm sorry about that , too . The doctors said you 'd never come out of it , that you 'd get lower and lower until you just ... just slipped away . And even if I had known . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of defense on her face . " Even if I 'd known , Johnny , I do n't think I could have waited . Four-and-a-half years is a long time . " " Yeah , it is , " he said . " That 's a hell of a long time . You want to hear something morbid ? I got them to bring me four years worth of news magazines just so I could see who died . Truman . Janis Joplin . Jimi Hendrix Jesus , I thought of him doing " Purple Haze " and I could hardly believe it . Dan Blocker . And you and mc . We just slipped away . " " I feel so bad about it , " she said , nearly whispering . " So damn guilty . But I love the guy , Johnny . I love him a lot . " " Okay , that 's what matters . " " His name is Walt Hazlett , and he 's a ... " " I think I 'd rather hear about your kid , " Johnny said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peach , " she said , smiling . " He 's seven months old now . His name is Dennis but we call him Denny . He 's named after his paternal grandfather . " " Bring him in sometime . I 'd like to see him . " " I will , " Sarah said , and they smiled at each other falsely , knowing that nothing of the kind was ever going to happen . " Johnny , is there anything that you need ? "  |p143Only  you , babe . And the last four-and-a-half years back again " Nah , " he said . " You still teachin ? " " Still teachin , for a while yet , " she agreed . " Still snortin that wicked cocaine ? " " Oh Johnny , you have n't changed . Same old tease . " " Same old tease , " he agreed , and the silence fell between them again with an almost audible thump . " Can I come see you again ? " " Sure , " he said . " That would be fine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to end so inconclusively , not wanting to hurt her or himselfif it could be avoided . Wanting to say something honest . " Sarah , " he said , " you did the right thing . " " Did I ? " she asked . She smiled , and it trembled at the corners of her mouth . " I wonder . It all seems so cruel and ... I ca n't help it , so wrong . I love my husband and my baby , and when Walt says that someday we 're going to be living in the finest house in Bangor , I believehim . He says someday he 's going to run for Bill Cohen 's seat in the House , and I believe that , too . He says someday someone from Maine is going to be elected president , and I can almost believe that . And I come in here and look at your poor legs . . . " She was beginning to cry again now . " They look like they went through a Mixmaster or something and you 're so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " You 're so thin and it seems wrong and cruel and I hate it , I hate it , because it is n't right at all , none of it ! " " Sometimes nothing is right , I guess , " he said . " Tough old world . Sometimes you just have to do what you can and try to live with it . You go and be happy , Sarah . And if you want to come and see me , come on and come . Bring a cribbage board . " " I will , " she said . " I 'm sorry to cry . Not very cheery for you , huh ? " " It 's all right , " he said , and smiled . " You want to get off that cocaine , baby . Your nose 'll fall off " She laughed a little . " Same old Johnny , " she said . Suddenly she bent and kissed his mouth . " Oh , Johnny , be well soon . " He looked at her thoughtfully as she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't leave it , " he said . " No , you did n't leave it at all . " " Leave what ? " She was frowning in puzzlement . " Your wedding ring . You did n't leave it in Montreal . " He had put his hand up to his forehead and was rubbing the patch of skin over his right eye with his fingers . His arm cast a shadow and she saw with something very like superstitious fear that his face was half-light , half-dark . It made her think of the Halloween mask he had scared her with . She and Walt had honeymooned in Montreal , but how could Johnny know that ? Unless maybe Herb had told him . Yes , that was almost certainly it . But only she and Walt knew that she had lost her wedding ring somewhere in the hotel room . No one else knew because he had bought her another ring before they flew home . She had been too embarrassed to tell anyone , even her mother . " How ... " Johnny frowned deeply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from his forehead and clasped its mate in his lap . " It was n't sized right , " he said . " You were packing , do n't you remember , Sarah ? He was out buying something and you were packing . He was out buying . . . buying ... do n't know . It 's in the dead zone . " Dead zone ? " He went out to a novelty shop and bought a whole bunch of silly stuff as souvenirs . Whoopee cushions and things like that . But Johnny , how could you know I lost my r ... " " You were packing . The ring was n't sized right , it was a lot too big . You were going to have it taken care of when you got back . But in the meantime , you ... you . . . " That puzzled frown began to return , then cleared immediately . He smiled at her . " You stuffed it with toilet paper ! " There was no question about the fear now . It was coiling lazily in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her throat and she stared at him , nearly hypnotized . He 's got the same look in his eyes , that same cold amused look that he had when he was beating the Wheel that night . What 's happened to you , Johnny ? What are you ? The blue of his eyes had darkened to a near violet , and he seemed far away . She wanted to run . The room itself seemed to be darkening , as if he were somehowp145tearing the fabric of reality , pulling apart the links between past and present . " It slipped off your finger , " he said . " You were putting his shaving stuff into one of those side pockets and it just slipped off . You did n't notice you 'd lost it until later , and so you thought it was somewhere in the room . " He laughed , and it was a high , tinkling , tripping sound  --  not like Johnny 's usual laugh at all  --  but cold ... cold . " Boy , you two turned that room upside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in that suitcase pocket . All this time . You go up in the attic and look , Sarah . You 'll see . " In the corridor outside , someone dropped a water glass or somethingand cursed in surprise when it broke . Johnny glanced toward the sound , and his eyes cleared . He looked back , saw her frozen , wideeyedface , and frowned with concern . " What ? Sarah , did I say something wrong ? " " How did you know ? " she whispered . " How could you know those things ? " " I do n't know , " he said . " Sarah , I 'm sorry if I ... " " Johnny , I ought to go , Denny 's with the sitter . " " All right . Sarah , I 'm sorry I upset you . " " How could you know about my ring , Johnny ? " He could only shake his head . Halfway down the first-floor corridor , her stomach began to feel strange . She found the ladies ' just in time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stalls , and threw up violently . She flushed and then stood with her eyes closed , shivering , but also close to laughter . The last time she had seen Johnny she had thrown up , too . Rough justice ? Brackets in time , like bookends ? She put her hands over her mouth to stifle whatever might be trying to get out  --  laughter or maybe a scream . And in the darkness the world seemed to tilt irrationally , like a dish . Like a spinning Wheel of Fortune.  |p146She  had left Denny with Mrs. Labelle , so when she got home the house was silent and empty . She went up the narrow stairway to the attic and turned the switch that controlled the two bare , dangling light bulbs . Their luggage was stacked up in one corner , the Montreal travel stickers still pasted to the sides of the orange Grants ' suitcases . There were three of them . She opened the first , felt through the elasticizedside pouches , and found nothing . Likewise the second . Likewise the third . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out , feeling foolish and a little disappointed  --  but mostly relieved . Overwhelmingly relieved . No ring . Sorry , Johnny . But on the other hand , I 'm not sorry at all . It would have been just a little bit too spooky . She started to slide the suitcases back into place between a tall pile of Walt 's old college texts and the floor lamp that crazy woman 's dog had knocked over and which Sarah had never had the heart to throw out . And as she dusted off her hands preparatory to putting the whole thing behind her , a small voice far inside her whispered , almost too low to hear , Sort of a flying search , was n't it ? Did n't really want to find anything , did you , Sarah ? No . No , she really had n't wanted to find anything . And if that little voice thought she was going to open all those suitcases again , it was crazy . She was fifteen minutes late in picking up Denny , Walt was bringing home one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a very big deal ) , and she owed Bettye Hackman a letter  --  from the Peace Corps in Uganda , Betty had gone directly into marriage with the son of a staggeringly rich Kentucky horse breeder . Also , she ought to clean both bathrooms , set her hair , and give Denny a bath . There was really too much to do to be frigging around up in this hot , dirty attic . So she pulled all three suitcases open again and this time she searched the side pockets very carefully , and tucked all the way down in the corner of the third suitcase she found her wedding ring . She held it up to the glare of one of the naked bulbs and read the engravinginside , still as fresh as it had been on the day Walt slipped the ring on her finger : WALTER AND SARAH HAZLETT  --  JULY 9 , 1972 . Sarah looked at it for a long time.  |p147Then  she put the suitcases back , turned off the lights , and went back downstairs . She changed out of the linen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into slacks and a light top . She went down the block to Mrs. Labelle 's and picked up her son . They went home and Sarah put Denny in the living room , where he crawled around vigorouslywhile she prepared the roast and peeled some potatoes . With the roast in the oven , she went into the living room and saw that Denny had gone to sleep on the rug . She picked him up and put him in his crib . Then she began to clean the toilets . And in spite of everything , in spite of the way the clock was racing toward dinnertime , her mind never left the ring . Johnny had known . She could even pinpoint the moment he had come by his knowledge : When she had kissed him before leaving . Just thinking about him made her feel weak and strange , and she was n't sure why . It was all mixed up . His crooked smile , so much the same , his body , so terribly changed , so slight and undernourished , the lifeless way his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rich memories she still held of him . She had wanted to kiss him . " Stop it , " she muttered to herself . Her face in the bathroom mirror looked like a stranger 's face . Flushed and hot and  --  let 's face it , gang , sexy . Her hand closed on the ring in the pocket of her slacks , and almost  --  butnot quite  --  before she was aware of what she was going to do , she had thrown it into the clean , slightly blue water of the toilet howl . All sparkly clean so that if Mr. Treaches of Baribault , Treaches , Moorehouse , and Gendron had to take a leak sometime during the dinner party , he would n't be offended by any unsightly ring around the bowl , who knows what roadblocks may stand in the way of a young man on his march toward the counsels of the mighty , right ? Who knows anything in this world ? It made a tiny splash and sank slowly to the bottom of the clear water , turning lazily over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when it struck the porcelain at the bottom , but that was probablyjust imagination . Her head throbbed . The attic had been hot and stale and musty . But Johnny 's kiss  --  that had been sweet . So sweet . Before she could think about what she was doing ( and thus allowp148reason to reassert itself ) , she reached out and flushed the toilet . It went with a bang and a roar . It seemed louder , maybe , because her eyes were squeezed shut . When she opened them , the ring was gone . It had been lost , and now it was lost again . Suddenly her legs felt weak and she sat down on the edge of the tub and put her hands over her face . Her hot , hot face . She would n't go back and see Johnny again . It was n't a good idea . It had upset her . Walt was bringing home a senior partner and she had a bottle of Mondavi and a budget-fracturing roast , those were the things she would think about . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and about Denny asleep in his crib . She should think about how , once you made your choices in this crazy world , you had to live with them . And she would not think about Johnny Smith and his crooked , charming smile anymore . The dinner that night was a great success . The doctor put Vera Smith on a blood-pressure drug called Hydrodiural . It did n't lower her blood pressure much ( " not a dime 's worth , " she was fond of writing in her letters ) , but it did make her feel sick and weak . She had to sit down and rest after vacuuming the floor . Climbing a flight of stairs made her stop at the top and pant like a doggy on a hot August afternoon . If Johnny had n't told her it was for the best , she would have thrown the pills out the window right then . The doctor tried her on another drug , and that made her heart race so alarmingly that she did stop taking it . " This is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll get you fixed up eventually , Vera . Do n't worry . "  | " I do n't worry , " Vera said . " My faith is in the Lord God . " " Yes , of course it is . Just as it should be , too . " By the end of June , the doctor had settled on a combination of Hydrodiuraland another drug called Aldomet  --  fat , yellow , expensive pills , nasty things . When she started taking the two drugs together , it seemed like she had to make water every fifteen minutes . She had headaches . She had heart palpitations . The doctor said her blood pressure was down into the normal range again , but she did n't believe him . What good were doctors , anyway ? Look what they were doing to her Johnny , cutting him up like butcher 's meat , three operations already , he looked like a monster with stitches all over his arms and legs and neck , and he still could n't get around without one of those walkers , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pressure was down , t why did she feel so crummy all the time ? " You 've got to give your body time enough to get used to the medication , " Johnny said . It was the first Saturday in July , and his parents were up for the weekend . Johnny had just come back from hydrotherapy , and he looked pale and haggard . In each hand he held a small lead ball , and he was raising them and then lowering them into his lap as they talked , flexing his elbows , building up his biceps and triceps . The healing scars which ran like slashmarks across his elbows and forearms expanded and contracted . " Put your faith in God , Johnny , " Vera said . " There 's no need of all this foolishness . Put your faith in God and he 'll heal you . " " Vera . . . " Herb began . " Do n't you Vera me . This is foolishness ! Does n't the Bible say , ask and it shall be given , knock and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need for me to take that evil medicine and no need for my boy to let those doctors go on torturing him . It 's wrong , it 's not helping , and it 's sinful ! " Johnny put the balls of lead shot on the bed . The muscles in his arms were trembling . He felt sick to his stomach and exhausted and suddenly furious at his mother . " The Lord helps those who help themselves , " he said . " You do n't want the Christian God at all , Mom . You want a magic genie that 's going to come out of a bottle and give you three wishes . "  | " Johnny ! " " Well , it 's true . " " Those doctors put that idea in your head ! All of these crazy ideas ! " Her lips were trembling ; her eyes wide but tearless . " God brought you out of that coma to do his will , John . These others , they 're just ... " " Just trying to get me back on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's will from a wheelchair the rest of my life . " " Let 's not have an argument , " Herb said . " Families should n't argue . " And hurricanes should n't blow , but they do every year , and nothing he could say was going to stop this . It had been coming . " If you put your trust in God , Johnny . . . " Vera began , taking no notice of Herb at all . " I do n't trust anything anymore . " " I 'm sorry to hear you say that , " she said . Her voice was stiff and distant . " Satan 's agents are everywhere . They 'll try to turn you from your destiny . Looks like they are getting along with it real well . " " You have to make some kind of ... of eternal thing out of it , do n't you ? I 'll tell you what it was , it was a stupid accident , a couple of kids were dragging and I just happened to get turned into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? I want to get out of here . That 's all I want . And I want you to go on taking your medicine and . . . and try to get your feet back on the ground . That 's all I want . " " I 'm leaving . " She stood up . Her face was pale and drawn . " I 'll pray for you , Johnny . " He looked at her , helpless , frustrated , and unhappy . His anger was gone . He had taken it out on her . " Keep taking your medicine ! " he said . " I pray that you 'll see the light . " She left the room , her face set and as grim as stone . Johnny looked helplessly at his father . " John , I wish you had n't done that , " Herb said . " I 'm tired . It does n't do a thing for my judgment . Or my temper . " " Yeah , " Herb said . He seemed about to say more and did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to California for that flying saucersymposium or whatever it is ? "  | " Yes . But she may change her mind . You never know from one day to the next , and it 's still a month away . " " You ought to do something . " " Yeah ? What ? Put her away ? Commit her ? " Johnny shook his head . " I do n't know . But maybe it 's time you thought about . that seriously instead of just acting like it 's out of the question . She 's sick . You have to see that . " Herb said loudly : " She was all right before you ... " Johnny winced , as if slapped . " Look , I 'm sorry . John , I did n't mean that . " " Okay , Dad . " " No , I really did n't . " Herb 's face was a picture of misery . " Look , I ought to go after her . She 's probably leafleting the hallways by now . " " Okay . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concentrate on getting well . She does love you , and so do I. Do n't be hard on us . " " No . It 's all right , dad . " Herb kissed Johnny 's cheek . " I have to go after her . " " All right . " Herb left . When they were gone , Johnny got up and tottered the three steps between his chair and the bed . Not much . But something . A start . He wished more than his father knew that he had n't blown up at his mother like that . He wished it because an odd sort of certainty was growing in him that his mother was not going to live much longer . Vera stopped taking her medication . Herb talked to her , then cajoled , finally demanded . It did no good . She showed him the letters of her " correspondents in Jesus , " most of them scrawled and full of misspellings , all of them supporting her stand and promising to pray for her . One of them was from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farm in Vermont , waiting for the end of the world ( along with her pet Pomeranian , Otis ) . " GOD is the best medicine , " this lady wrote , " ask GOD and YOU WILL BE HEALED , not DRS whop152OSURP the POWER of GOD , it is DRS who have caused all the CANCER in this evil world with there DEVIL 'S MEDDLING , anyone who has had SURGERY for instance , even MINOR like TONSILSOUT , sooner or later they will end up with CANCER , this is a proven fact , so ask GOD , pray GOD , merge YOUR WILL with HIS WILL and YOU WILL BE HEALED ! ! " Herb talked to Johnny on the phone , and the next day Johnny called his mother and apologized for being so short with her . He asked her to please start taking the medicine again  --  for him . Vera accepted his apology , but refused to go back to the medication . If God needed her treading the earth , then he would see she continued to tread it . If God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even if she took a barrel of pills a day . It was a seamless argument , and Johnny 's only possible rebuttal was the one that Catholics and Protestants alike have rejected for eighteen hundred years : that God works His will through the mind of man as well as through the spirit of man . " Momma , " he said , " have n't you thought that God 's will was for some doctor to invent that drug so you could live longer ? Ca n't you even consider that idea ? " Long distance was no medium for theological argument . She hung up . The next day Marie Michaud came into Johnny 's room , put her head on his bed , and wept . " Here , here , " Johnny said , startled and alarmed . " What 's this ? What 's wrong ? " " My boy , " she said , still crying . " My Mark . They operated on him and it was just like you said . He 's fine . He 's going to see out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hugged Johnny and he hugged her back as best he could . With her warm tears on his own cheek , he thought that whatever had happened to him was n't all bad . Maybe some things should be told , or seen , or found again . It was n't even so farfetched to think that God was working through him , although his own concept of God was fuzzy and ill-defined . He held Marie and told her how glad he was . He told her to remember that he was n't the one who had operated on Mark , and that he barely remembered what it was that he had told her.  |p153She  left shortly after that , drying her eyes as she went , leaving Johnny alone to thinkEarly in August , Dave Pelsen came to see Johnny . The Cleaves Mills High assistant principal was a small , neat man who wore thick glasses and Hush Puppies and a series of loud sports jackets . Of all the people who came to see Johnny during that almost endless summer of 1975 , Dave had changed the least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hair , but that was all . " So how are you doing ? Really ? " Dave asked , when they had finished the amenities . " Not so bad , " Johnny said . " I can walk alone now if I do n't overdo it . I can swim six laps in the pool . I get headaches sometimes , real killers , but the doctors say I can expect that to go on for some time . Maybe the rest of my life . " " Mind a personal question ? " " If you 're going to ask me if I can still get it up , " Johnny said with a grin , " that 's affirmative . " " That 's good to know , but what I wanted to know about is the money . Can you pay for this ? " Johnny shook his head . " I 've been in the hospital for going on five years . No one but a Rockefeller could pay for that . My father and mother got me into some sort of state-funded program . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nodded . " The Extraordinary Disaster program . I figured that . taut how did they keep you out of the state hospital , Johnny ? That place is the pits . " " Dr. Weizak and Dr. Brown saw to that . And they 're largely responsiblefor my having been able to come back as far as I have . I was a ... a guinea pig , Dr. Weizak says . How long can we keep this comatoseman from turning into a total vegetable ? The physical therapy unit was working on me the last two years I was in coma . I had megavitamin shots ... my ass still looks like a case of smallpox . Not that they expected any return on the project from me personally . I was assumed to be a terminal case almost from the time I came in . Weizakp154says that what he and Brown did with me is aggressive life support . ' He thinks it 's the beginning of a response to all the criticism about sustaining life after hope of recovery is gone . Anyway , they could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the state hospital , so they kept me here . Eventually , they would have finished with me and then I would have gone to the state hospital . " " Where the most sophisticated care you would have gotten would have been a turn every six hours to prevent bedsores , " Dave said . " And if you 'd waked up in 1980 , you would have been a basket case . " " I think I would have been a basket case no matter what , " Johnny said . He shook his head slowly . " I think if someone proposes one more operation on me , I 'll go nuts . And I 'm still going to have a limp and I 'll never be able to turn my head all the way to the left . " " When are they letting you out ? " " In three weeks , God willing . " " Then what ? " Johnny shrugged . " I 'm going down home , I guess . To Pownal . My mother 's going to be in California for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I can use the time to get reacquainted . I got a letter from one of the big literary agents in New York ... well , not him , exactly , but one of his assistants . They think there might be a book in what happened to me . I thought I 'd try to do two or three chapters and an outline , maybe this guy or his assistant can sell it . The money would come in pretty damn handy , no kidding there . " " Has there been any other media interest ? " " Well , the guy from the Bangor Daily News who did the original story ... " " Bright ? He 's good . " " He 'd like to come down to Pownal after I blow this joint and do a feature story . I like the guy , but right now I 'm holding him off There 's no money in it for me , and right now , frankly , that 's what I 'm looking for . I 'd go on To Tell the Truth ' if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . My folks ' savings are gone . They sold their car and bought a clunker . Dad took a second mortgage on the house when he should have been thinking about retiring and selling it and living on the proceeds . "  | " Have you thought about coming back into teaching ? " Johnny glanced up . " Is that an offer ? " " It ai n't chopped liver . " " I 'm grateful , " Johnny said . " But I 'm just not going to be ready in September , Dave . " " I was n't thinking about September . You must remember Sarah 's friend , Anne Strafford ? " Johnny nodded . " Well , she 's Anne Beatty now , and she 's going to have a baby in December . So we need an Englishteacher second semester . Light schedule . Four classes , one senior study hall , two free periods . " " Are you making a firm offer , Dave ? " " Firm . " " That 's pretty damn good of you , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dave said easily . " You were a pretty damn good teacher . " " Can I have a couple of weeks to think it over ? " " Until the first of October , if you want , " Dave said . " You 'd still be able to work on your book , I think . If it looks like there might be a possibility there . " Johnny nodded . " And you might not want to stay down there in Pownal too long , " Dave said . " You might find it ... uncomfortable . " Words rose to Johnny 's lips and he had to choke them ofl : . Not for long , Dave . You see , my mother 's in the process of blowing her brains out right now . She 's just not using a gun . She 's going to have a stroke . She 'll be dead before Christmas unless my father and I can persuade her to start taking her medicine again , and I do n't think we can . And I 'm a part of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I do n't think I want to know . Instead he replied , " News travels , huh ? " Dave shrugged . " I understand through Sarah that your mother has had problems adjusting . She 'll come around , Johnny . In the meantime , think about it . " " I will . In fact , I 'll give you a tentative yes right now . It would be good to teach again . To get back to normal . " " You 're my man , " Dave said . After he left , Johnny lay down on his bed and looked out the win/dow . He was very tired . Get back to normal . Somehow he did n't think that was ever really going to happen . He felt one of his headaches coming on . The fact that Johnny Smith had come out of his coma with something extra finally did get into the paper , and it made page one under David Bright 's by-line . It happened less than a week before Johnny left the hospital . He was in physical therapy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his belly was a twelve-pound medicine ball . His physical therapist , Eileen Magown , was standing above him and counting off situps . He was supposed to do ten of them , and he was currently struggling over number eight . Sweat was streaming down his face , and the healing scars on his neck stood out bright red . Eileen was a small , homely woman with a whipcord body , a nimbus of gorgeous , frizzy red hair , and deep green eyes flecked with hazel . Johnny sometimes called her  --  with a mixture of irritation and amusement  --  theworld 's smallest Marine D.I . She had ordered and cajoled and demanded him back from a bed-fast patient who could barely hold a glass of water to a man who could walk without a cane , do three chinups at a time , and do a complete turn around the hospital pool in fifty-three seconds  --  not Olympic time , but not bad . She was unmarriedand lived in a big house on Center Street in Oldtown with her four cats . She was slate-hard and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collapsed backward . " Nope , " he panted . " Oh , I do n't think so , Eileen . " " Up , boy ! " she cried in high and sadistic good humor . " Up ! Up ! Just three more and you can have a Coke ! " " Give me my ten-pound ball and I 'll give you two more . " " That ten-pound ball is going into the Guinness Book of Records as the world 's biggest suppository if you do n't give me three more . Up ! " " Urrrrrrgrah ! " Johnny cried , jerking through number eight . He flopped back down , then jerked up again . " Great ! " Eileen cried . " One more , one more ! " " OOOOOARRRRRRRRUNCH ! " Johnny screamed , and sat up for thep157tenth time . He collapsed to the mat , letting the medicine ball roll away . " I ruptured myself , are you happy , all my guts just came loose , they 're floating around inside me , I 'll sue you , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Eileen said , offering him her hand . " This is nothing compared to what I 've got on for next time . " " Forget it , " Johnny said . " All I 'm gon na do next time is swim in the ... " He looked at her , an expression of surprise spreading over his face . His grip tightened on her hand until it was almost painful . " Johnny ? What 's wrong ? Is it a charley horse ? " " Oh gosh , " Johnny said mildly . " Johnny ? " He was still gripping her hand , looking into her face with a faraway , dreamy contemplation that made her feel nervous . She had heard things about Johnny Smith , rumors that she had disregarded with her own brand of hard-headed Scots pragmatism . There was a story that he had predicted Marie Michaud 's boy was going to be all right , even beforethe doctors were one hundred percent sure they wanted to try the risky operation . Another rumor had something to do with Dr. Weizak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not dead but livingsomeplace on the West Coast under another name . As far as Eileen Magown was concerned , the stories were so much eyewash , on a par with the confession magazines and sweet-savage love stories so many nurses read on station . But the way he was looking at her now made her feel afraid . It was as if he was looking inside her . " Johnny , are you okay ? " They were alone in the physical therapy room . The big double doors with the frosted glass panels which gave on the pool area were closed . " Gosh sakes , " Johnny said . " You better . . . yes , there 's still time . Just about . " " What are you talking about ? " He snapped out of it then . He let go of her hand ... but he had gripped it tightly enough to leave white indentations along the back . " Call the fire department , " he said . " You forgot to turn off the burner . The curtains are catching on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | " The burner caught the dish towel and the dish towel caught the curtains , " Johnny said impatiently . " Hurry up and call them . Do you want your house to burn down ? " " Johnny , you ca n't know . . . " " Never mind what I ca n't know , " Johnny said , grabbing her elbow . He got her moving and they walked across to the doors . Johnny was limping badly on his left leg , as he always did when he was tired . They crossed the room that housed the swimming pool , their heels clacking hollowly on the tiles , then went out into the first floor hallway and down to the nurses ' station . Inside , two nurses were drinking coffee and a third was on the phone , telling someone on the other end how she had redone her apartment . " Are you going to call or should I ? " Johnny asked . Eileen 's mind was in a whirl . Her morning routine was as set as a single person 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boiled herself a singleegg while she ate a whole grapefruit , unsweetened , and a bowl of All-Bran . After breakfast she had dressed and driven to the hospital . Had she turned off the burner ? Of course she had . She could n't specificallyremember doing it , but it was habit . She must have . " Johnny , really , I do n't know where you got the idea . . . " " Okay , I will . " They were in the nurses ' station now , a glassed-in booth furnished with three straight-backed chairs and a hot plate . The little room was dominated by the callboard  --  rows of small lights that flashed red when a patient pushed his call button . Three of them were flashing now . The two nurses went on drinking their coffee and talking about some doctor who had turned up drunk at Benjamin 's . The third was apparently talking with her beautician . " Pardon me , I have to make a call , " Johnny said . The nurse covered the phone with her hand . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Thanks , " Johnny said , and took the phone out of her hand . He pushed for one of the open lines and dialed O. He got a busy signal . " What 's wrong with this thing ? " " Hey ! " The nurse who had been talking to her beautician cried . " What the hell do you think you 're doing ? Give me that ! "  |p159Johnny  remembered that he was in a hospital with its own switchboardand dialed 9 for an outside line . Then he redialed the 0 . The deposed nurse , her cheeks flaming with anger , grabbed for the phone . Johnny pushed her away . She whirled , saw Eileen , and took a step toward her . " Eileen , what 's with this crazy guy ? " she asked stridently . The other two nurses had put down their coffee cups and were staring gape-mouthed at Johnny . Eileen shrugged uncomfortably . " I do n't know , he just ... " " Operator . " " Operator , I want to report a fire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give me the correct number to call , please ? " " Hey , " one of the nurses said . " Whose house is on fire ? " Eileen shifted her feet nervously . " He says mine is . " The nurse who had been talking about her apartment to her beauticiandid a double take . " Oh my God , it 's that guy , " she said . Johnny pointed at the callboard , where five or six lights were flashingnow . " Why do n't you go see what those people want ? " The operator had connected him with the Oldtown Fire Department . " My name is John Smith and I need to report a fire . It 's at ... " He looked at Eileen . " What 's your address ? " For a moment Johnny did n't think she was going to tell him . Her mouth worked , but nothing came out . The two coffee-drinkers had now forsaken their cups and withdrawn to the station 's far corner . They were whispering together like little girls in a grammar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " the voice on the other end asked . " Come on , " Johnny said , " do you want your cats to fry ? " " 624 Center Street , " Eileen said reluctantly . " Johnny , you 've wigged out . " Johnny repeated the address into the phone . " It 's in the kitchen . " " Your name , Sir ? " John Smith . I 'm calling from the Eastern Maine Medical Center in Bangor . " " May I ask how you came by your information ? " " We 'd be on the phone the rest of the day . My information is cor/rect . Now go put it out . " He banged the phone down. " ... and he said Sam Weizak 's mother was still ... " She broke off and looked at Johnny . For a moment he felt all of them looking at him , their eyes lying on his skin like tiny , hot weights , and he knew what would come of this and it made his stomachturn . " Eileen , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a friend next door ? " " Yes . . . Burt and Janice are next door ... " " Either of them home ? " " I guess Janice probably would be , sure . " " Why do n't you give her a call ? " Eileen nodded , suddenly understanding what he was getting at . She took the phone from his hand and dialed an 827 exchange number . The nurses stood by watching avidly , as if they had stepped into a really exciting TV program by accident . " Hello ? Jan ? It 's Eileen . Are you in your kitchen ? ... Would you take a look out your window and tell me if everything looks , well , all right over at my place ? . . . Well , a friend of mine says . . . I 'll tell you after you go look , okay ? " Eileen was blushing . " Yes , I 'll wait . " She looked at Johnny and repeated , " You 've wigged out , Johnny . " There was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eileen began listening again . She listened for a long time and then said in a strange , subdued voice totally unlike her usual one : " No , that 's all right , Jan . They 've been called . No . . . I ca n't explain right now but I 'll tell you later . " She looked at Johnny . " Yes , it is funny how I could have known ... but I can explain . At least I think I can . Good-bye . " She hung up the telephone . They all looked at her , the nurses with avid curiosity , Johnny with only dull certainty . " Jan says there 's smoke pouring out of my kitchen window , " Eileen said , and all three nurses sighed in unison . Their eyes , wide and somehowaccusing , turned to Johnny again . Jury 's eyes , he thought dismally . " I ought to go home , " Eileen said . The aggressive , cajoling , positive physical therapist was gone , replaced by a small woman who was wor/tied about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ... I do n't know how to thank you , Johnny ... I 'm sorry I did n't believe you , but ... " She began to weep . One of the nurses moved toward her , but Johnny was there first . He put an arm around her and led her out into the hall . " You really can , " Eileen whispered . " What they said ... " " You go on , " Johnny said . " I 'm sure it 's going to be fine . There 's going to be some minor smoke and water damage , and that 's all . That movie poster from Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid , I think you 're going to lose that , but that 's all . " " Yes , okay . Thank you , Johnny . God bless you . " She kissed him on the cheek and then began to trot down the hall . She looked back once , and the expression on her face was very much like superstitious dread . The nurses were lined up against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Suddenly they reminded him of crows on a telephone line , crows staring down at something bright and shiny , something to be pecked at and pulled apart . " Go on and answer your calls , " he said crossly , and they flinched back at the sound of his voice . He began to limp up the hall toward the elevator , leaving them to start the gossip on its way . He was tired . His legs hurt . His hip joints felt as if they had broken glass in them . He wanted to go to bed . " What are you going to do ? " Sam Weizak asked . " Christ , I do n't know , " Johnny said . " How many did you say are down there ? " " About eight . One of them is the northern New England AP stringer . And there are people from two of the TV stations with camerasand lights . The hospital director is quite angry with you , Johnny . He feels you have been naughty . "  | " Because a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Johnny asked . " All I can say is it must have been one frigging slow news day . " " As a matter of fact , it was n't . Ford vetoed two bills . The P.L.O . blew up a restaurant in Tel Aviv . And a police dog sniffed out four hundred pounds of marijuana at the airport . " " Then what are they doing here ? " Johnny asked . When Sam had come in with the news that reporters were gathering in the lobby , his first sinking thought was what his mother might make of this . She was with his father in Pownal , making ready for her California pilgrimage , which began the following week . Neither Johnny nor his fatherbelieved the trip was a good idea , and the news that her son had somehow turned psychic might make her cancel it , but in this case Johnny was very much afraid that the cure might be the greater of two evils . Something like this could set her off for good . On the other hand  --  this thought suddenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  it might persuade her to start taking her medicine again . " They 're here because what happened is news , " Sam said . " It has all the classic ingredients . " " I did n't do anything , I just ... " " You just told Eileen Magown her house was on fire and it was , " Sam said softly . " Come on , Johnny , you must have known this was going to happen sooner or later . " " I 'm no publicity hound , " Johnny said grimly . " No . I did n't mean to suggest you were . An earthquake is no publicityhound . But the reporters cover it . People want to know . " " What if I just refuse to talk to them ? " " That is not much of an option , " Sam replied . " They will go away and publish crazy rumors . Then , when you leave the hospital , they will fall on you . They will shove microphones in your face as if you were a senator or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . " Is Bright down there ? " " Yes . " " Suppose I ask him to come up ? He can get the story and give it to the rest of them . " " You can do that , but it would make the rest of them extremelyp163unhappy . And an unhappy reporter will be your enemy . Nixon made them unhappy and they tore him to pieces . " " I 'm not Nixon , " Johnny said . Weizak grinned radiantly . " Thank God , " he said . " What do you suggest ? " Johnny asked . The reporters stood up and crowded forward when Johnny stepped through the swing doors and into the west lobby . He was wearing a white shirt , open at the collar , and a pair of blue jeans that were too big for him . His face was pale but composed . The scars from the tendonoperations stood out clearly on his neck . Flashbulbs popped warm fire at him and made him wince . Questions were babbled . " Here ! Here ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! He wants to make a brief statement and he will answer some of your questions , but only if you behave in an orderly fashion ! Now fall back and let him breathe ! " Two sets of TV light bars flashed on , bathing the lobby in an unearthlyglare . Doctors and nurses had gathered by the lounge doorway to watch . Johnny winced away from the lights , wondering if this was what they meant by the limelight . He felt as if all of it might be a dream . " Who 're you ? " one of the reporters yelled at Weizak . " I am Samuel Weizak , this young man 's doctor , and that name is spelled with two X 's . " There was general laughter and the mood eased a little . " Johnny , you feel all right ? " Weizak asked . It was early evening , and his sudden insight that Eileen Magown 's kitchen was catching fire seemed distant and unimportant , the memory of a memory . " Sure , " he said . " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Well , " Johnny said , " it 's this . My physical therapist is a woman named Eileen Magown . She 's a very nice lady , and she 's been helping me get my strength back . I was in an accident , you see , and . . . " One of the TV cameras moved in , goggling at him blankly , throwing him olist ride for a moment . " ... and I got pretty weak . My muscles sort ofp164collapsed . We were in the physical therapy room this morning , just finishing up , and I got the feeling that her house was on fire . That is , to be more specific ... " Jerre , you sound like an arrh ' /e . ' " I felt that she had forgotten to turn off her stove and that the curtains in the kitchen were about to catch fire . So we just went and called the fire departmentand that 's all there was to it . " There was a moment 's gaping pause as they digested that  --  I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was to it  --  and then the barrage of questions came again , everything mixed together into a meaningless stew of human voices . Johnny looked around helplessly , feeling disorientedand vulnerable . " One at a time ! " Weizak yelled . " Raise your hands ! Were you never schoolchildren ? " Hands waved , and Johnny pointed at David Bright . " Would you call this a psychic experience , Johnny ? " " I would call it a feeling , " Johnny answered . " I was doing situps and I finished . Miss Magown took my hand to help me up and I just knew . " He pointed at someone else . " Mel Allen , Portland Sunday Telegram , Mr. Smith . Was it like a picture ? A picture in your head ? " " No , not at all , " Johnny said , but he was not really able to remember what it had been like . " Has this happened to you before , Johnny ? " A young woman in a slacksuit asked . " Yes , a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other incidents ? " " No , I 'd rather not . " One of the TV reporters raised his hand and Johnny nodded at him . " Did you have any of these flashes before your accident and the resultingcoma , Mr. Smith ? " Johnny hesitated . The room seemed very still . The TV lights were warm on his face , like a tropical sun . " No , " he said . Another barrage of questions . Johnny looked helplessly at Weizak again.  | " Stop ! Stop ! " He bellowed . He looked at Johnny as the roar subsided . " You are done , Johnny ? " " I 'll answer two more questions , " Johnny said . " Then ... really .. . it 's been a long day for me . . . yes , Ma'am ? " He was pointing to a stout woman who had wedged herself in between two young reporters . " Mr. Smith , " she said in a loud , carrying , tubalike voice , " who will be the Democrats ' nominee for president next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Johnny said , honestly surprised at the question . " How could I tell you that ? " More hands were raised . Johnny pointed to a tall , sober-faced man in a dark suit . He took one step forward . There was something prim and coiled about him . " Mr. Smith , I 'm Roger Dussault , from the Lewiston Sun , and I would like to know if you have any idea why you should have such an extraordinary ability as this ... if indeed you do . Why you , Mr. Smith ? " Johnny cleared his throat . " As I understand your question ... you 're asking me to justify something I do n't understand . I ca n't do that . " " Not justify , Mr. Smith . Just explain . " Ile thinks I 'm hoaxing them . Or hying . Weizak stepped up beside Johnny . " I wonder if I might answer that , " he said . " Or at least attempt to explain why it can not be answered . " " Are you psychic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , all neurologists must be , it 's a requirement , " Weizak said . There was a burst of laughter and Dussault flushed . " Ladies and gentlemen of the press . This man spent four-and-a-half rears in a coma . We who study the human brain have no idea why he did , or why he came out of it , and this is for the simple reason that we do not understand what a coma really is , any more than we understandsleep or the simple act of waking . Ladies and gentlemen , we do not understand the brain of a frog or the brain of an ant . You may quote me on these things ... you see I am fearless , nuh ? " More laughter . They liked Weizak . But Dussault did not laugh.  | " You may also quote me as saying I believe that this man is now in possession of a very new human ability , or a very old one . Why ? If I and my colleagues do not understand the brain of an ant , can I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggest some interesting things to you , however , things which may or may not have bearing . A part of John Smith 's brain has been damaged beyond repair  --  a very small part , but all parts of the brain may be vital . He calls this his dead zone , ' and there , apparently , a number of trace memories were stored . All of these wiped-out memories seem to be part of a set '  --  that of street , road , and highway designations . A subset of a larger overall set , that of where is it . This is a small but total aphasia which seems to include both language and visualization skills . " Balancing this off , another tiny part of John Smith 's brain appears to have awakened . A section of the cerebrum within the parietal lobe . This is one of the deeply grooved sections of the forward ' or ' thinking ' brain . The electrical responses from this section of Smith 's brain are way out of line from what they should be , nuh ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something to do with the sense of touch  --  how much or how little we are not completely sure  --  and it is very near to that area of the brain that sorts and identifies various shapes and textures . And it has been my own observation that John 's flashes ' are always preceded by some sort of touching . " Silence . Reporters were scribbling madly . The TV cameras , which had moved in to focus on Weizak , now pulled back to include Johnny in the picture . " Is that it , Johnny ? " Weizak asked again . " I guess . . . " Dussault suddenly shouldered his way through the knot of reporters . For a bemused moment Johnny thought he was going to join them in front of the doors , possibly for the purpose of rebuttal . Then he saw that Dussault was slipping something from around his neck . " Let 's have a demonstration , " he said . He was holding a medallion on a fine-link gold chain . " Let 's see what you can do with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Weizak said . His bushy salt-and-pepper eyebrows had drawn thunderously together and he stared down at Dussault like Moses . " This man is not a carnival performer , sir ! "  | " You sure could have fooled me , " Dussault said . " Either he can or he ca n't , right ? While you were busy suggesting things , I was busy suggesting something to myself . What I was suggesting was that these guys can never perform on demand , because they 're all as genuineas a pile of three-dollar bills . " Johnny looked at the other reporters . Except for Bright , who looked rather embarrassed , they were watching avidly . They looked like the nurses peering at him through the glass . Suddenly he felt like a Christian in a pitful of lions . They win either way , he thought . If I can tell him something , they 've got a front-page story . If I ca n't , or if I refuse to try , they 've got another kind of story . " Well ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his fist . Johnny looked at Weizak , but Weizak was looking away , disgusted . " Give it to me , " Johnny said . Dussault handed it over . Johnny put the medallion in his palm . It was a St. Christopher medal . He dropped the fine-link chain on top of it in a crisp little yellow heap and closed his hand over it . Dead silence fell in the room . The handful of doctors and nurses standing by the lounge doorway had been joined by half a dozen others , some of them dressed in streetclothes and on their way out of the hospital for the night . A crowd of patients had gathered at the end of the hallway leading to the first-floor TV and game lounge . The people who had come for the regular early evening visiting hours had drifted over from the main lobby . A feeling of thick tension lay in the air like a humming power cable . Johnny stood silently , pale and thin in his white shirt and oversized blue jeans . The St. Christopher medal was clamped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his wrist stood out clearly in the glare of the TV light bars . In front of him , sober , impeccable , and judgmental in his dark suit , Dussault stood in the adversary position . The momentseemed to stretch out interminably . No one coughed or whispered . " Oh , " Johnny said softly ... then : " Is that it ? " His fingers loosened slowly . He looked at Dussault . " Well ? " Dussault asked , but the authority was suddenly gone fromp168his voice . The tired , nervous young man who had answered the reporters ' questions seemed also to be gone . There was a half-smile on Johnny 's lips , but there was nothing warm about it . The blue of his eyes had darkened . They had grown cold and distant . Weizak saw it and felt a chill of gooseflesh . He later told his wife that it had been the face of a man looking through a high-powered microscope and observingan interesting species of paramecium . " It 's your sister 's medallion , " he said to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her Terry . Your older sister . You loved her . You almost worshiped the ground she walked on . " Suddenly , terribly , Johnny Smith 's voice began to climb and change . It became the cracked and unsure voice of an adolescent . " It 's for when you cross Lisbon Street against the lights , Terry , or when you 're out parking with one of those guys from E.L . Do n't forget , Terry . . . do n't forget ... " The plump woman who had asked Johnny who the Democrats would nominate next year uttered a frightened little moan . One of the TV cameramen muttered " Holy Jesus ! " in a hoarse voice . " Stop it , " Dussault whispered . His face had gone a sick shade of gray . His eyes bulged and spittle shone like chrome on his lower lip in this harsh light . His hands moved for the medallion , which was now looped on its fine gold chain over Johnny 's fingers . But his hands moved with no power or authority . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of light . " Remember me , Terry , " the adolescent voice begged . " Stay clean , Terry . . . please , for God 's sake stay clean ... " " Stop it ! Stop it , you bastard ! " Now Johnny spoke in his own voice again . " It was speed , was n't it ? Then meth . She died of a heart attack at twenty-seven . But she wore it ten years , Rog . She remembered you . She never forgot . Never forgot ... never ... never ... never . " The medallion slipped from his fingers and struck the floor with a small , musical sound . Johnny stared away into emptiness for a moment , his face calm and cool and distant . Dussault grubbed at his feet for the medallion , sobbing hoarsely in the stunned silence.  |p169A  flashbulb popped , and Johnny 's face cleared and became his own again . Horror touched it , and then pity . He knelt clumsily beside Dussault . " I 'm sorry , " he said . " I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheapjack , bastard hoaxer ! " Dussault screamed at him . " It 's a lie ! All a lie ! All a lie ! " He struck Johnny a clumsy , open-handed blow on the neck and Johnny fell over , striking his head on the floor , hard . He saw stars . Uproar . He was dimly aware that Dussault was pushing his way blindly through the crowd and toward the doors . People milled around Dussault , around Johnny . He saw Dussault through a forest of legs and shoes . Then Weizak was beside him , helping him to sit up . " John , are you all right ? Did he hurt you ? " " Not as bad as I hurt him . I 'm okay . " He struggled to his feet . I lands  --  maybe Weizak 's , maybe someone else 's  --  helped him . He felt dizzy and sick ; almost revolted . This had been a mistake , a terrible mistake . Someone screamed piercingly  --  the stout woman who had asked about the Democrats . Johnny saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleeve of the stout woman 's print blouse and then slide tiredly forward onto the tile near the doorway he had been trying to reach . The St. Christopher medal was still in one hand . " Fainted , " someone said . " Fainted dead away . I 'll be damned . " " My fault , " Johnny said to Sam Weizak . His throat felt close and tight with shame , with tears . " All my fault . " " No , " Sam said . " No , John . " But it was . He shook loose of Weizak 's hands and went to where Dussault lay , coming around now , eyes blinking dazedly at the ceiling . Two of the doctors had come over to where he lay . " Is he all right ? " Johnny asked . He turned toward the woman reporterin the slacksuit and she shrank away from him . A cramp of fear passed over her face . Johnny turned the other way , toward the TV reporter who had asked him if he 'd had any flashes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explain to someone . " I did n't mean to hurt him , " he said . " Honest to God , I never meant to hurt him . I did n't know ... " The TV reporter backed up a step . " No , " he said . " Of course you did n't . He was asking for it , anybody could see that . Just ... do n't touch me , huh ? " Johnny looked at him dumbly , lips quivering . He was still in shock but beginning to understand . Oh yes . He was beginning to understand . The TV reporter tried to smile and could only produce a death's-head rictus . " Just do n't touch me , Johnny . Please . " " It 's not like that , " Johnny said  --  or tried to . Later , he was never sure if any sound had come out . " Do n't touch me , Johnny , okay ? " The reporter backed up to where his cameraman was packing his gear . Johnny stood and watched him . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your own good , John , " Weizak said . The nurse stood behind him , a white ghost , a sorcerer 's apprentice with her hands hovering above the small , wheeled medication table , a junkie 's paradise of sweet dreams . " No , " Johnny said . He was still shaking , and now there was cold sweat as well . " No more shots . I 've had it up to here with shots . " " A pill , then . " " No more pills , either . " " To help you sleep . " " Will he be able to sleep ? That man Dussault ? " " He asked for it , " the nurse murmured , and then flinched as Weizakturned toward her . But Weizak smiled crookedly . " She is right , nuh ? " he said . " The man asked for it . He thought you were selling empty bottles , John . A good night 's sleep and you 'll be able to put this in perspective . " " I 'll sleep on my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was quarter past eleven . The TV across the room had just gone off Johnny and Sam had watched the filmed story together ; it had been second-lined right after the bills Ford had vetoed . My own story made better theater , Johnny thought with morbid amusement . Film footage of a bald-headed Republican mouthing platitudes about the national budget just did n't compare with the film clip that WABI camera man had gotten here earlier this evening . The clip had ended with Dussault plunging across the floor with his sister 's medal clutched in his hand and then crashing down in a faint , clutching at the woman reporter the way a drowning man might clutch at a straw . When the TV anchorman went on to the police dog and the four hundred pounds of pot , Weizak had left briefly and had come back with the news that the hospital switchboard had jammed up with calls for him even before the report was over . The nurse with the medicationhad shown up a few minutes later , leading Johnny to believe that Sam had gone down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on incoming calls . At that instant , the telephone rang . Weizak swore softly under his breath . " I told them to hold them all . Do n't answer it , John , I 'll ... " But Johnny already had it . He listened for a moment , then nodded . " Yes , that was right . " He put a hand over the receiver . " It 's my dad , " he said . He uncovered the receiver . " Hi , Dad . I guess you . . . " He listened . The small smile on his lips faded and was replaced by an expression of dawning horror . His lips moved silently . " John , what is it ? " Weizak asked sharply . " All right , Daddy , " Johnny said , almost in a whisper . " Yes . CumberlandGeneral . I know where it is . Just above Jerusalem 's Lot . Okay . All right . Daddy ... " His voice broke . His eyes were tearless but glistening . " I know that , Daddy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Listened . " Yes . Yes it was , " Johnny said . " I 'll see you , Daddy . Yes . Good-bye . "  |p172He  hung up the phone , put the heels of his hands to his eyes , and pressed . " Johnny ? " Sam leaned forward , took one of his hands away and held it gently . " Is it your mother ? " " Yeah . It 's my mother . " " Heart attack ? " " Stroke , " Johnny said , and Sam Weizak made a small , pained hissingbetween his teeth . " They were watching the TV news ... neither of them had any idea ... and I came on ... and she had a stroke . Christ . She 's in the hospital . Now if something happens to my dad , we got a triple play . " He uttered a high scream of laughter . His eyes rolled wildly from Sam to the nurse and back to Sam again . " It 's a good talent , " he said . " Everybody should have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a scream . " How bad is she ? " Sam asked . " He does n't know . " Johnny swung his legs out of bed . He had changed back to a hospital gown and his feet were bare . " What do you think you are doing ? " Sam asked sharply . " What does it look like ? " Johnny got up , and for a moment it seemed that Sam would push him back onto the bed . But he only watched Johnny limp over to the closet . " Do n't be ridiculous . You 're not ready for this , John . " Unmindful of the nurse  --  they had seen his bare tail enough times , God knew Johnny let the gown drop around his feet . The thick , twisting scars stood out on the backs of his knees and dimpled into the scant swell of his calves . He began to rummage in the closet for clothes , and came up with the white shirt and jeans he had worn to the news conference . " John , I absolutely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I tell you , it is madness . " " Forbid all you want , I 'm going , " Johnny said . He began to dress . His face wore that expression of distant preoccupation that Sam associated with his trances . The nurse gawped . " Nurse , you might as well go back to your station , " Sam said . She backed to the door , stood there for a moment , and then left . Reluctantly.  | " Johnny , " Sam said . He got up , went to him , and put a hand on his shoulder . " You did n't do it . " Johnny shook the hand off . " I did it , all right , " he said . " She was watching me when it happened . " He began to button the shirt . " You urged her to take her medicine and she stopped . " Johnny looked at Weizak for a moment and then went back to buttoning his shirt . " If it had n't happened tonight , it would have happened tomorrow , next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next year . Or in ten years . " " No . It would not have been ten years , or even one . And you know it . Why are you so anxious to pin this tail on yourself ? Because of that smug reporter ? Is it maybe an inverted kind of self-pity ? An urge to believe that you have been cursed ? " Johnny 's face twisted . " She was watching me when it happened . Do n't you get that ? Are you so fucking soft you do n't get that ? " " She was planning a strenuous trip , all the way to California and back , you told me that yourself . A symposium of some kind . A highly emotional sort of thing , from what you have said . Yes ? Yes . It would almost certainly have happened then . A stroke is not lightning from a blue sky , Johnny . " Johnny buttoned the jeans and then sat down as if the act of dressinghad tired him out too much to do more . His feet were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yeah , you may be right . " " Sense ! He sees sense ! Thank the Lord ! " " liut I still have to go , Sam . " Weizak threw up his hands . " And do what ? She is in the hands of her doctors and her God . That is the situation . Better than anyone else , you must understand . " " My dad will need me , " Johnny said softly . " I understand that , " How will you go ? It 's nearly midnight . " " lay bus . I 'll grab a cab over to Peter 's Candlelighter . The Greyhoundsstill stop there , do n't they ? " " You do n't have to do that , " Sam said . Johnny was groping under the chair for his shoes and not findingp174them . Sam got them from under the bed and handed them to him . " I 'll drive you down . " Johnny looked up at him . " You 'd do that ? " " If you 'll take a mild @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . " He realized in a confused sort of way that the only concrete thing he knew about Weizak 's personal life was that his mother was living in California . " I am divorced , " Weizak said . " A doctor has to be out at all hours of the night ... unless he is a podiatrist or a dermatologist , nuh ? My wife saw the bed as half-empty rather than half-full . So she filled it with a variety of men . " " I 'm sorry , " Johnny said , embarrassed " You spend far too much time being sorry , John . " Sam 's face was gentle , but his eyes were stern . " Put on your shoes . " 1Hospital to hospital , Johnny thought dreamily , flying gently along on the small blue pill he had taken just before he and Sam left the EMMC and climbed into Sam 's ' 75 El Dorado . Hospital to hospital , person to person , station to station . In a queer , secret way , he enjoyed the trip  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost five years . The night was clear , the Milky Way sprawled across the sky in an unwinding clockspring of light , a half-moon followed them over the dark tree line as they fled south through Palmyra , Newport , Pittsfield , Benton , Clinton . The car whisperedalong in near total silence . Low music , Haydn , issued from the four speakers of the stereo tape player . Came to one hospital in the Cleaves Mills Rescue Squad ambulance , went to another in a Cadillac , he thought . He did n't let it bother him . It was just enough to ride , to float along on the track , to let the problem ofp175his mother , his new ability , and the people who wanted to pry into his soul ( He asked for it ... just do n't touch me , huh ? ) rest in a temporary limbo . Weizak did n't talk . Occasionally he hummed snatches of the music . Johnny watched the stars . He watched the turnpike , nearly deserted this late . It unrolled ceaselessly in front of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Weizak took a time-and-toll ticket . Then they went on again  --  Gardener , Sabbatus , Lewiston . Nearly five years , longer than some convicted murderers spend in the slam . He slept . Dreamed . " Johnny , " his mother said in his dream . " Johnny , make me better , make me well . " She was in a beggar 's rags . She was crawling toward him over cobblestones . Her face was white . Thin blood ran from her knees . White lice squirmed in her thin hair . She held shaking hands out to him . " It 's the power of God working in you , " she said . " It 's a great responsibility , Johnny . A great trust . You must be worthy . " He took her hands , closed his own over them , and said , " Spirits , departfrom this woman . " She stood up . " Healed ! " she cried in a voice that was filled with a strange and terrible triumph . " Healed , My son has healed me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He tried to protest , to tell her that he did n't want to do great works , or heal , or speak in tongues , to divine the future , or find those things that had been lost . He tried to tell her , but his tongue would n't obey the command of his brain . Then she was past him , striding off down the cobbled street , her posture cringing and servile but somehowarrogant at the same time ; her voice belled like a clarion : " Saved , Savior ! Saved ! Savior ! " And to his horror he saw that there had been thousands of others behind her , maybe millions , all of them maimed or deformed or in terror . The stout lady reporter was there , needing to know who the Democrats would nominate for the presidency in 1976 ; there was a death-eyed farmer in biballs with a picture of his son , a smiling young man in Air Force blues , who had been reported MIA over Hanoi in 1972 , he needed to know if his son was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with tears on her smooth cheeks , holding up a baby with a hydrocephalic head on which blue veins were traced like runes of doom ; an old man with his fingers turned into clubs by arthritis ; others . They stretched for miles , they would wait patiently , they would kill him with their mute , bludgeoning need . " Saved . " His mother 's voice carried back imperatively . " Savior ! Saved ! Saved . " He tried to tell them that he could neither heal nor save , but before he could open his mouth to make the denial , the first had laid hands on him and was shaking him . The shaking was real enough . It was Weizak 's hand on his arm . Bright orange light filled the car , turning the interior as bright as day  --  it was nightmare light , turning Sam 's kind face into the face of a hobgoblin . For a moment he thought the nightmare was still going on and then he saw the light was coming from parking-lot lamps . They had changed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his coma . From hard white to a weird orange that lay on the skin like paint . " Where are we ? " he asked thickly . " The hospital , " Sam said . " Cumberland General . " " Oh . All right . " He sat up . The dream seemed to slide off him in fragments , still litteringthe floor of his mind like something broken and not yet swept up . " Are you ready to go in ? " " Yes , " Johnny said . They crossed the parking lot amid the soft creak of summer crickets in the woods . Fireflies stitched through the darkness . The image of his mother was very much on him  --  but not so much that he was unable to enjoy the soft and fragrant smell of the night and the feel of the faint breeze against his skin . There was time to enjoy the health of the night , and the feeling of health coming inside him . In the context of why he was here , the thought seemed almost obscene  --  but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came down the hallway to meet them , and Johnny saw that his father was wearing old pants , shoes with no socks , and his pajama shirt . It told Johnny a lot about the suddenness with which it had come . It told him more than he wanted to know . " Son , " he said . He looked smaller , somehow . He tried to say more and could n't . Johnny hugged him and Herb burst into tears . He sobbed against Johnny 's shirt . " Daddy , " he said . " That 's all right , Daddy , that 's all right . " His father put his arms on Johnny 's shoulders and wept . Weizak turned away and began to inspect the pictures on the walls , indifferent water colors by local artists . Herb began to recover himself . He swiped his arm across his eyes and said , " Look at me , still in my pj top . I had time to change before the ambulance came . I guess I never thought of it . Must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Well . " He shrugged . " Your doctor friend brought you down ? That was nice of you , Dr. Weizak . " Sam shrugged . " It was nothing . " Johnny and his father walked toward the small waiting room and sat down . " Daddy , is she ... " " She 's sinking , " Herb said . He seemed calmer now . " Conscious , but sinking . She 's been asking for you , Johnny . I think she 's been holding on for you . " " My fault , " Johnny said . " All this is my f ... " The pain in his ear startled him , and he stared at his father , astonished . Herb had seized his ear and twisted it firmly . So much for the role reversal of having his father cry in his arms . The old twist-the-ear trick had been a punishment Herb had reserved for the gravest of errors . Johnny could n't remember having his ear twisted since he was thirteen , and had gotten fooling around with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clutch and the old car had rumbled silently downhill to crash into their back shed . " Do n't you ever say that , " Herb said . ' Jeez Dad . "  |p178Herb  let go , a little smile lurking just below the corners of his mouth . " Forgot all about the old twist-the-ear , huh ? Probably thought I had , too . No such luck , Johnny . " Johnny stared at his father , still dumbfounded . " Do n't you ever blame yourself . " " But she was watching that damned ... " " News , yes . She was ecstatic , she was thrilled ... then she was on the floor , her poor old mouth opening and closing like she was a fish out of water . " Herb leaned closer to his son . " The doctor wo n't come right out and tell me , but he asked me about heroic measures . ' I told him none of that stuff . She committed her own kind of sin , Johnny . She presumed to know the mind of God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mistake . " Fresh tears glinted in his eyes . His voice roughened . " God knows I spent my life loving her and it got hard in the late going . Maybe this is just the best thing . " " Can I see her ? " " Yes , she 's at the end of the hall , Room 35 . They 're expecting you , and so is she . Just one thing , Johnny . Agree with anything and everythingshe might say . Do n't ... let her die thinking it was all for nothing . " " No . " He paused . " Are you coming with me ? " " Not now . Maybe later . " Johnny nodded and walked up the hall . The lights were turned down low for the nighttime . The brief moment in the soft , kind summernight seemed far away now , but his nightmare in the car seemed very close . Room 35 . VERA HELEN SMITH , the little card on the door read . Had he known her middle name was Helen ? It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But he could remember other things : her bringing him an ice-cream bar wrapped in her handkerchief one bright summer day at Old Orchard Beach , smiling and gay . He and his mother and father playing rummy for matches  --  later , after the religionbusiness began to deepen its hold on her , she would n't have cards in the house , not even to play cribbage with . He remembered the day the bee had stung him and he ran to her , bawling his head off , and she had kissed the swelling and pulled out the stinger with twee/zers and then had wrapped the wound in a strip of cloth that had been dipped in baking soda . He pushed the door open and went in . She was a vague hump in the bed and Johnny thought , That 's what I looked like . A nurse was taking her pulse ; she turned when the door opened and the dim hall lights flashed on her spectacles . " Are you Mrs. Smith 's son ? " " Yes . " " Johnny ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dry and hollow , rattling with death as a few pebbles will rattle in an empty gourd . The voice  --  God help him  --  made his skin crawl . He moved closer . Her face was twisted into a snarling mask on the left-hand side . The hand on the counterpane was a claw . Stroke , he thought . What the old people call a shock . Yes . That 's better . That 's what she looks like . Like she 's had a bad shock . " Is that you , John ? " " It 's me , Ma . " " Johnny ? Is that you ? " " Yes , Ma . " He came closer yet , and forced himself to take the bony claw . " I want my Johnny , " she said querulously . The nurse shot him a pitying look , and he found himself wanting to smash his fist through it . " Would you leave us alone ? " he asked . " I really should n't while ... " " Come on , she 's my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Johnny said . " What about it ? " " Well . . . " " Bring me my juice , Dad ! " his mother cried hoarsely . " Feel like I could drink a quart ! " " Would you get out of here ? " he cried at the nurse . He was filled with a terrible sorrow of which he could not even find the focus . It seemed like a whirlpool going down into darkness . The nurse left . " Ma , " he said , sitting beside her . That weird feeling of doubled time , of reversal , would not leave him . How many times had she satp180over his bed like this , perhaps holding his dry hand and talking to him ? He recalled the timeless period when the room had seemed so close to him  --  seen through a gauzy placental membrane , his mother 's face bending over him , thundering senseless sounds slowly into his upturned face . " Ma , " he said again , and kissed the hook that had replaced her hand . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said . Her left eye seemed frozen in its orbit ; the other rolled wildly . It was the eye of a gutshot horse . " I want Johnny . " " Ma , I 'm here . " John-ny ! John-ny ! JOHN-NY ! " " Ma , " he said , afraid the nurse would come back . " You ... " She broke off and her head turned toward him a little . " Bend over here where I can see , " she whispered . He did as she asked . " You came , " she said . " Thank you . Thank you . " Tears began to ooze from the good eye . The bad one , the one on the side of her face that had been frozen by the shock , stared indifferently upward . " Sure I came . " " I saw you , " she whispered . " What a power God has given you , Johnny ! Did n't I tell you ? Did n't I say it was so ? " " Yes , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she said . " Do n't run from him , Johnny . Do n't hide away in a cave like Elijah or make him send a big fish to swallow you up . Do n't do that , John . " " No . I wo n't . " He held her claw-hand . His head throbbed . " Not the potter but the potter 's clay , John . Remember . " " All right . " " Remember that ! " she said stridently , and he thought , She 's going back into nonsense land . But she did n't ; at least she went no further into nonsense land than she had been since he came out of his coma . " Heed the still , small voice when it comes , " she said . " Yes , Ma . I will . " Her head turned a tiny bit on the pillow , and  --  was she smiling ? " You think I 'm crazy , I guess . " She twisted her head a little more ,  |p181so  she could look directly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 'll know the voice when it comes . It 'll tell you what to do . It told Jeremiahand Daniel and Amos and Abraham . It 'll come to you . It 'll tell you . And when it does , Johnny ... do your duty . " " Okay , Ma . " " What a power , " she murmured . Her voice was growing furry and indistinct . " What a power God has given you ... I knew ... I always knew ... " Her voice trailed off . The good eye closed . The other stared blankly forward . Johnny sat with her another five minutes , then got up to leave . His hand was on the doorknob and he was easing the door open when her dry , rattling voice came again , chilling him with its implacable , positivecommand . " Do your duty , John . " " Yes , Ma . " It was the last time he ever spoke to her . She died at five minutes past eight on the morning of August 20 . Somewhere north of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about Johnny that was almost an argument , and somewhere south of them , Greg Stillson was cutting himself some prime asshole . " You do n't understand , " Greg Stillson said in a voice of utter , reasonablepatience to the kid sitting in the lounge at the back of the k idgeway police station . The kid , shirtless , was tilted back in a padded ( hiding chair and drinking a bottle of Pepsi . He was smiling indulgentlyat Greg Stillson , not understanding that twice was all Greg Stillson ever repeated himself , understanding that there was one prime iashole in the room , but not yet understanding who it was . That realization would have to be brought home to him . Forcibly , if necessary.  |p182Outside  , the late August morning was bright and *arm . Birds sang in the trees . And Greg felt his destiny was closer than ever . That was why he would be careful with this prime asshole . This was no longhairedbike-freak with a bad case of bowlegs and B.O. ; this kid was a college boy , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was George Harvey 's nephew . Not that George cared for him much ( George had fought his way across Germany in 1945 , and he had two words for these long-haired freaks , and those two words were not Happy Birthday ) , but he was blood . And George was a man to be reckoned with on the town council . See what you can do with him , George had told Greg when Greg informed him that Chief Wiggins had arrested his sister 's kid . But his eyes said , Do n't hurt him . He'sblood . The kid was looking at Greg with lazy contempt . " I understand , " he said . " Your Deputy Dawg took my shirt and I want it back . And you better understand something . If I do n't get it back , I 'm goingto have the American Civil Liberties Union down on your red neck . " Greg got up , went to the steel-gray file cabinet opposite the soda machine , pulled out his keyring , selected a key , and opened the cabinet . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he took a red Tshirt . He spread it open so the legend on it was clear : BABY LET 'S FUCK . " You were wearing this , " Greg said in that same mild voice . " On the street . " The kid rocked on the back legs of his chair and swigged some more Pepsi . The little indulgent smile playing around his mouth  --  almost a sneer  --  did not change . " That 's right , " he said . " And I want it back . It 's my property . " Greg 's head began to ache . This smartass did n't realize how easy it would be . The room was soundproofed , and there had been times when that soundproofing had muffled screams . No  --  he did n't realize . He did n't understand . But keep your hand on it . Do n't go overboard . Do n't upset the applecart . Easy to think . Usually easy to do . But sometimes , his temper  --  his temper got out of hand.  |p183Greg  reached into his pocket and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go tell your gestapo chief and my fascist uncle that the First Amendment . . . " He paused , eyes widening a little . " What are you ... ? Hey ! Hey ! " Taking no notice and at least outwardly calm , Greg struck a light . The Bic 's gas flame vroomed upward , and Greg lit the kid 's T-shirt on fire . It burned quite well , actually . The front legs of the kid 's chair came down with a bang and he leaped toward Greg with his bottle of Pepsi still in his hand . The selfsatisfiedlittle smirk was gone , replaced with a look of wide-eyed shock and surprise  --  and the anger of a spoiled brat who has had everything his own way for too long . No one ever called him runt , Greg Stillson thought , and his headache worsened . Oh , he was going to have to be careful . " Gim me that ! " the kid shouted . Greg was holding the shirt out , pinched together in two fingers at the neck , ready @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gim me that , you asshole ! That 's mine ! That 's ... " Greg planted his hand in the middle of the kid 's bare chest and shoved him as hard as he could  --  which was hard indeed . The kid went flying across the room , the anger dissolving into total shock , and  --  at last  --  what Greg needed to see : fear . He dropped the shirt on the tile floor , picked up the kid 's Pepsi , and poured what was left in the bottle onto the smouldering T-shirt . It hissed balefully . The kid was getting up slowly , his back pressed against the wall . Greg caught his eyes with his own . The kid 's eyes were brown and very , very wide . " We 're going to reach an understanding , " Greg said , and the words seemed distant to him , behind the sick thud in his head . " We 're going to have a little seminar right here in this back room about just who 's the asshole . You got my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Is n't that what you college boys like to do ? Reach conclusions ? " The kid drew breath in hitches . He wet his lips , seemed about to speak , and then yelled : " Help ! " " Yeah , you need help , all right , " Greg said . " I 'm going to give you some , too . "  | " You 're crazy , " George Harvey 's nephew said , and then yelled again , louder : " HELP ! " " I may be , " Greg said . " Sure . But what we got to find out , Sonny , is who the prime asshole is . See what I mean ? " He looked down at the Pepsi bottle in his hand , and suddenly he swung it savagely against the corner of the steel cabinet . It shattered , and when the kid saw the scatter of glass on the floor and the jagged neck in Greg 's hand pointing toward him , he screamed . The crotch of his jeans , faded almost white , suddenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And as Greg walked toward him , gritting glass under the workboots he wore summer and winter , he cringed against the wall . " When I go out on the street , I wear a white shirt , " Greg said . He was grinning , showing white teeth . " Sometimes a tie . When you go out on the street , you wear some rag with a filthy saying on it . So who 's the asshole , kiddo ? " George Harvey 's nephew whined something . His bulging eyes never left the spears of glass jutting from the bottle neck in Greg 's hand . " I 'm standing here high and dry , " Greg said , coming a little closer , " and you got piss running down both legs into your shoes . So who 's the asshole ? " He began to jab the bottle neck lightly toward the kid 's bare and sweaty midriff , and George Harvey 's nephew began to cry . This was the sort of kid that was tearing the country in two , Greg thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his head . Stinking yellowbellycrybaby assholes like this . Ah , but do n't hurt him  --  do n't kick over the applecart " I sound like a human being , " Greg said , " and you sound like a pig in a grease-pit , boy . So who 's the asshole ? " He jabbed with the bottle again ; one of the jagged glass points dimpled the kid 's skin just below the right nipple and brought a tiny bead of blood . The kid howled . " I 'm talking to you , " Greg said . " You better answer up , same as you 'd answer up one of your professors . Who 's the asshole ? " The kid sniveled but made no coherent sound.  | " You answer up if you want to pass this exam , " Greg said . " I 'll let your guts loose all over this floor , boy . " And in that instant , he meant it . He could n't look directly at this welling drop of blood ; it would send him crazy if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Who 's the asshole ? " " Me , " the kid said , and began to sob like a small child afraid of the bogeyman , the Allamagoosalum that waits behind the closet door in the dead hours of the night . Greg smiled . The headache thumped and flared . " Well , that 's pretty good , you know . That 's a start . But it 's not quite good enough . I want you to say , ' I 'm an asshole . ' " " I 'm an asshole , " the kid said , still sobbing . Snot flowed from his nose and hung there in a runner . He wiped it away with the back of his hand . " Now I want you to say , ' I 'm a prime asshole . ' " " I . . . I 'm a prime asshole . " " Now you just say one more thing and maybe we can be done here . You say , ' Thank you for burning up that dirty shirt , Mayor Stillson . ' " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way clear . " Thanks for burning up that dirty shirt . " In a flash , Greg ran one of the jagged points from left to right across the kid 's soft belly , bringing a line of blood . He barely broke the skin , but the kid howled as if all the devils of hell were behind him . " You forgot to say ' Mayor Stillson , ' " Greg said , and just like that it broke . The headache gave one more massive beat right between his eyes and was gone . He looked down stupidly at the bottle neck in his hand and could barely remember how it had gotten there . Stupid damn thing . He had almost thrown everything away over one numbnutskid . " Mayor Stillson ! " The kid was screaming . His terror was perfect and complete . " Mayor Stillson ! Mayor Stillson ! Mayor Still ... " " That 's good , " Greg said. ... son ! Mayor Stillson ! Mayor Stillson ! Mayor ... " Greg whacked him hard across the face , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silent , his eyes wide and blank.  |p186Greg  stepped very close to him . He reached out . He closed one hand around each of the kid 's ears . He pulled the kid 's face forward until their noses were touching . Their eyes were less than half an inch apart . " Now , your uncle is a power in this town , " he said softly , holding the kid 's ears like handles . The kid 's eyes were huge and brown and swimming . " I 'm a power too  --  coming to be one  --  but I ai n't no George Harvey . He was born here , raised here , everything . And if you was to tell your uncle what went on in here , he might take a notion to finish me in Ridgeway . " The kid 's lips were twitching in a nearly soundless blubber . Greg shook the boy 's head slowly back and forth by the ears , banging their noses together . " He might not . . . he was pretty damn mad about that shirt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So you think about this , son . If you was to tell your uncle what went on here and your uncle squeezed me out , I guess I would come along and kill you . Do you believe that ? " " Yeah , " the kid whispered . His cheeks were wet , gleaming . " Yes sir , Mayor Stillson ' " Yessir , Mayor Stillson . " Greg let go of his ears . " Yeah , " he said . " I 'd kill you , but first I 'd tell anybody that 'd listen about how you pissed yourself and stood there crying with snot running out of your nose . " He turned and walked away quickly , as if the kid smelled bad , and went to the cabinet again . He got a box of Band-Aids from one of the shelves and tossed them across to the kid , who flinched back and fumbledthem . He hastened to pick them up off the floor , as if Stillson might attack him again for missing . Greg pointed . " Bathroom over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ na leave you a Ridgeway PAL sweatshirt . I want it mailed back , clean , no bloodstains . You understand ? " " Yes , " the kid whispered . " SIR ! " Stillson screamed at him . " SIR ! SIR ! SIR ! Ca n't you remember that ? " " Sir , " the kid moaned . " Yessir , Yessir. "  | " They do n't teach you kids respect for nothing , " Greg said . " Not for nothing . " The headache was trying to come back . He took several deep breaths and quelled it  --  but his stomach felt miserably upset . " Okay , that 's the end . I just want to offer you one good piece of advice . Do n't you make the mistake of getting back to your damn college this fall or whenever and start thinking this was some way it was n't . Do n't you try to kid yourself about Greg Stillson . Best forgotten , kid . By you , me , and George . Working this around in your mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be the worst mistake of your life . " Maybe the last . " With that Greg left , taking one last contemptuous look at the kid standing there , his chest and belly caked with a few minor smears of dried blood , his eyes wide , his lips trembling . He looked like an overgrown ten-year-old who has struck out in the Little League playoffs . Greg made a mental bet with himself that he would never see or hear from this particular kid again , and it was a bet he won . Later that week , George Harvey stopped by the barbershop where Greg was getting a shave and thanked him for " talking some sense " into his nephew . " You 're good with these kids , Greg , " he said . " I du n no .. they seem to respect you . " Greg told him not to mention it . While Greg Stillson was burning a shirt with an obscene saying on it in New Hampshire , Walt and Sarah Hazlett were having a late breakfastin Bangor , Maine . Walt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a clink and said , " Your old boyfriendmade the paper , Sarah . " Sarah was feeding Denny . She was in her bathrobe , her hair somethingof a mess , her eyes still only about a quarter open . Eighty percent of her mind was still asleep . There had been a party last night . The guest of honor had been Harrison Fisher , who had been New Hampshire 's third district congressman since dinosaurs walked thep188earth , and a sure candidate for reelection next year . It had been politic for her and Walt to go . Politic . That was a word that Walt used a lot lately . He had had lots more to drink than she had , and this morning he was dressed and apparently chipper while she felt buried in a pile of sludge . It was n't fair . " Blue ! " Denny remarked , and spat back a mouthful of mixed fruit . " That 's not nice , " Sarah said to Denny . To Walt : " Are you talking about Johnny Smith ? " " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around to Walt 's side of the table . " He 's all right , is n't he ? " " Feeling good and kicking up dickens by the sound of this , " Walt said dryly . She had a hazy idea that it might be related to what had happened to her when she went to see Johnny , but the size of the headline shocked her : REAWAKENED COMA PATIENT DEMONSTRATES PSYCHIC ABILITY AT DRAMATIC NEWS CONFERENCE . The story was under David Bright 's by-line . The accompanying photo showed Johnny , still looking thin and , in the unsparing glare of the flash , pitifully confused , standing over the sprawled body of a man the caption identified as Roger Dussault , a reporter for the Lewiston paper . Reporter Faints after Revelation , the caption read . Sarah sank down into the chair next to Walt and began to read the article . This did not please Denny , who began to pound on the tray of his highchair for his morning egg . " I believe you 're being summoned , " Walt said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eats better for you anyway . " Story Continued Page 9 , Col. 3 . She folded the paper open to page nine . " Flattery will get you everywhere , " Walt said agreeably . He slipped off his sports coat and put on her apron . " Here it comes , guy , " he said , and began feeding Denny his egg . When she had finished the story , Sarah went back and read it again . Her eyes were drawn again and again to the picture , to Johnny 's confused , horror-struck face . The people loosely grouped around the prone Dussault were looking at Johnny with an expression closep189to fear . She could understand that . She remembered kissing him , and the strange , preoccupied look that had slipped over his face . And when he told her where to find the lost wedding ring , she had been afraid . But Sarah , what you were afraid of was n't quite the same thing , was it ? " Just a little more , big boy , " Walt was saying , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up at them , sitting together in a bar of mote-dusted sunlight , her apron flapping between Walt 's knees , and she was suddenly afraid again . She saw the ring sinking to the bottom of the toilet bowl , turning over and over . She heard the small clink as it struck the porcelain . She thought of Halloween masks , of the kid saying , I love to see this guy take a beatin . She thought of promises made and never kept , and her eyes went to his thin newsprint face , looking out at her with such haggard , wretched surprise. " ... gimmick , anyway , " Walt said , hanging up her apron . He had gotten Denny to eat the egg , every bit of it , and now their son and heir was sucking contentedly away at a juice-bottle . " Huh ? " Sarah looked up as he came over to her . " I said that for a man who must have almost half a million dollars ' worth of hospital bills outstanding , it 's a helluva good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What do you mean , gimmick ? " " Sure , " he said , apparently missing her anger . " He could make seven , maybe ten thousand dollars doing a book about the accident and the coma . But if he came out of the coma psychic , the sky 's the limit . " " That 's one hell of an allegation ! " Sarah said , and her voice was thin with fury . He turned to her , his expression first one of surprise and then of understanding . The understanding look made her angrier than ever . If he had a nickel for every time Walt Hazlett had thought he understoodher , they could fly first-class to Jamaica . " Look , I 'm sorry I brought it up , " he said . " Johnny would no more lie than the Pope would . . . would ... youknow . " He bellowed laughter , and in that moment she nearly picked up hisp190own coffee cup and threw it at him . Instead , she locked her hands togethertightly under the table and squeezed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into his own peal of laughter . " Honey , " Walt said . " I have nothing against him , I have nothing against what he 's doing . In fact , I respect him for it . If that fat old mossback Fisher can go from a broke lawyer to a millionaire during fifteen years in the House of Representatives , then this guy should have a perfect right to pick up as much as he can playing psychic ... " " Johnny does n't lie , " she repeated tonelessly . " It 's a gimmick for the blue-rinse brigade who read the weekly tabloidsand belong to the Universe Book Club , " he said cheerily . " AlthoughI will admit that a little second sight would come in handy during jury selection in this damn Timmons trial . " " Johnny Smith does n't lie , " she repeated , and heard him saying : It slipped off your finger . You were putting his shaving stuff into one of those side pockets and it just slipped off . . . you go up in the attic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she could n't tell Walt that . Walt did n't know she had been to see Johnny . Nothing wrong in going to see him , her mind offered uneasily . No , but how would he react to the news that she had thrown her original wedding ring into the toilet and flushed it away ? He might not understand the sudden twitch of fear that had made her do it  --  the same fear she saw mirrored on those other newsprint faces , and , to some degree , on Johnny 's own . No , Walt might not understand that at all . After all , throwing your wedding ring into the toilet and then pushing the flush did suggest a certain vulgar symbolism . " All right , " Walt was saying , " he does n't lie . But I just do n't believe ... " Sarah said softly , " Look at the people behind him , Walt . Look at their faces . They believe . " Walt gave them a cursory glance . " Sure , the way a kid believes in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You think this fellow Dussault was a , what-do-you-call-it , a shill ? According to the article , he and Johnny had never met before . " " That 's the only way the illusion will work , Sarah , " Walt said patiently . " It does n't do a magician any good to pull a bunny out of ap191rabbit hutch , only out of a hat . Either Johnny Smith knew something or he made a terribly good guess based on this guy Dussault 's behaviorat the time . But I repeat , I respect him for it . He got a lot of mileageout of it . If it turns him a buck , more power to him . " In that moment she hated him , loathed him , this good man she had married . There was really nothing so terrible on the reverse side of his goodness , his steadiness , his mild good humor  --  just the belief , apparentlygrounded in the bedrock of his soul , that everybody was looking out for number one , each with his or her own little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fat old mossback ; last night he had been bellowing with laughter at Fisher 's stories about Greg Stillson , the funny mayor of some-town-or-other and who might just be crazy enough to run as an independent in the House race next year . No , in the world of Walt Hazlett , no one had psychic powers and there were no heroes and the doctrine of **42;6103;TOOLONG all-powerful . He was a good man , a steady man , he loved her and Denny , but suddenly her soul cried out for Johnny and the five years together of which they had been robbed . Or the lifetime together . A child with darker hair . " You better get going , babe , " she said quietly . " They 'll have your guy Timmons in stocks and bonds , or whatever they are . " " Sure . " He smiled at her , the summation done , session adjourned . " Still friends ? " " Still friends . " But he knew where the ring was . He knew . Walt kissed her , his right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He always had the same thing for breakfast , he always kissed her the same way , some day they were going to Washington , and no one was psychic . Five minutes later he was gone , backing their little red Pinto out onto Pond Street , giving his usual brief toot on the horn , and putting away . She was left alone with Denny , who was in the process of stranglinghimself while he tried to wiggle under his highchair tray . " You 're going at that all wrong , Sluggo , " Sarah said , crossing the kitchen and unlatching the tray . " Blue ! " Denny said , disgusted with the whole thing.  |p192S|peedy  Tomato , their tomcat , sauntered into the kitchen at his usual slow , hipshot juvenile delinquent 's stride , and Denny grabbed him , making little chuckling noises . Speedy laid his ears back and looked resigned . Sarah smiled a little and cleared the table . Inertia . A body at rest tends to remain at rest , and she was at rest . Never mind Walt 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no intention of doing more than sendingJohnny a card at Christmas . It was better , safer , that way  --  because a body in motion tends to keep moving . Her life here was good . She had survived Dan , she had survived Johnny , who had been so unfairly taken from her ( but so much in this world was unfair ) , she had come through her own personal rapids to this smooth water , and here she would stay . This sunshiny kitchen was not a bad place . Best to forget county fairs , Wheels of Fortune , and Johnny Smith 's face . As she ran water into the sink to do the dishes she turned on the radio and caught the beginning of the news . The first item made her freeze with a just-washed plate in one hand , her eyes looking out over their small backyard in startled contemplation . Johnny 's mother had had a stroke while watching a TV report on her son 's press conference . She had died this morning , not an hour ago . Sarah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pried Speedy Tomatoout of Denny 's hands . She carried her boy into the living room and popped him into his playpen . Denny protested this indignity with loud , lusty howls of which she took no notice . She went to the telephone and called the EMMC . A switchboard operator who sounded tired of repeating the same piece of intelligence over and over again told her that John Smith had discharged himself the night before , slightly before midnight . She hung up the phone and sat down in a chair . Denny continued to cry from his playpen . Water ran into the kitchen sink . After a while she got up , went into the kitchen , and turned it off.  |p193The  man from Inside View showed up on October 16 , not long after Johnny had walked up to get the mail . His father 's house was set well back from the road ; their graveled driveway was nearly a quarter of a mile long , running through a heavy stand of second-growth spruce and pine . Johnny did the total round trip every day . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exhaustion , his legs on fire , his limp so pronounced that he was really lurching along . But now , a month and a half after the first time ( when the half a mile had taken him an hour to do ) , the walk had become one of his day 's pleasures , something to look forward to . Not the mail , but the walk . He had begun splitting wood for the coming winter , a chore Herb had been planning to hire out since he himself had landed a contract to do some inside work on a new housing project in Libertyville . " You know when old age has started lookin over your shoulder , John , " he had said with a smile . " It 's when you start lookin for inside work as soon as fall rolls around . " Johnny climbed the porch and sat down in the wicker chair beside the glider , uttering a small sound of relief . He propped his right foot on the porch railing , and with a grimace of pain , used his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done , he began to open his mail . It had tapered off a lot just lately . During the first week he had been back here in Pownal , there had sometimes been as many as two dozen letters and eight or nine packages a day , most of them forwarded through the EMMC , a few of them sent to General Delivery , Pownal ( and assorted variant spellings : Pownell , Poenul , and , in one memorablecase , Poonuts ) . Most of them were from dissociated people who seemed to be driftingthrough life in search of any rudder . There were children who wanted his autograph , women who wanted to sleep with him , bothp194men and women seeking advice to the lovelorn . Some sent lucky charms . Some sent horoscopes . A great many of the letters were religiousin nature , and in these badly spelled missives , usually written in a large and careful handwriting but one step removed from the scrawl of a bright first-grader , he seemed to feel the ghost of his mother . He was a prophet , these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disillusioned American people out of the wilderness . He was a sign that the Last Times were at hand . To this date , October 16 , he had received eight copies of Hal Lindsey 's The Late Great Planet Earth  --  his mother surely would have approved of that one . He was urged to proclaim the divinity of Christ and put a stop to the loose morals of youth . These letters were balanced off by the negative contingent , which was smaller but just as vocal  --  if usually anonymous . One correspondent , writing in grubby pencil on a sheet of yellow legal paper proclaimedhim the Antichrist and urged him to commit suicide . Four or five of the letter writers had inquired about how it felt to murder your own mother . A great many wrote to accuse him of perpetrating a hoax . One wit wrote , " PRECOGNITION , TELEPATHY , BULLSHIT ! EAT MY DONG , YOU EXTRASENSORY TURKEY ! " And they sent things . That was the worst of it . Every day on his way home from work , Herb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the packages that were too big to fit in their mailbox . The notes accompanying the things were all essentially the same ; a lowgrade scream . Tell me , tell me , tell me . This scarf belonged to my brother , who disappeared on a fishing trip in the Allagash in 1969 . I feel very strongly that he is still alive . Tell me where he is . This lipstick came from my wife 's dressing table . I think she 's having an affair , but I 'm not sure . Tell me if she is . This is my son 's ID bracelet . He never comes home after school anymore , he stays out until all hours , I 'm worried sick . Tell me what he 's doing . A woman in North Carolina  --  God knew how she had found out about him ; the press conference in August had not made the national media  --  sent a charred piece of wood . Her house had burned down ,  |p195her  letter explained , and her husband and two of her five children had died @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was faulty wiring , but she simply could n't accept that . It had to be arson . She wanted Johnny to feel the enclosed blackened relic and tell her who had done it , so the monster would spend the rest of his life rotting in prison . Johnny answered none of the letters and returned all the objects ( even the charcoaled hunk of wood ) at his cost and with no comment . He did touch some of them . Most , like the charred piece of wallboard from the grief-stricken woman in Charlotte , told him nothingat all . But when he touched a few of them , disquieting images came , like waking dreams . In most cases there was barely a trace ; a picture would form and fade in seconds , leaving him with nothing concrete at all , only a feeling . But one of them .. . It had been the woman who sent the scarf in hopes of finding out what had happened to her brother . It was a white knitted scarf , no different from a million others . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's house had suddenly been gone , and the sound of the television in the next room rose and flattened , rose and flattened , until it was the sound of drowsing summer insects and the faraway babble of water . Woods smells in his nostrils . Green shafts of sunlight falling through great old trees . The ground had been soggy for the last three hours or so , squelchy , almost swamplike . He was scared , plenty scared , but he had kept his head . If you were lost in the big north country and panicked , they might as well carve your headstone . He had kept pushing south . It had been two days since he had gotten separated from Stiv and Rocky and Logan . They had been camping near ( but that would n't come , it was in the dead zone ) some stream , trout-fishing , and it had been his own damn fault ; he had been pretty damn drunk . Now he could see his pack leaning against the edge of an old and moss-grown blowdown , white deadwood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could sec his pack , yes , but he could n't reach it because he had walked a few yards away to take a leak and he had walked into a really squelchy place , mud almost to the tops of his LL . Bean 's boots , and he tried to back out , find a dryer place to do hisp196business , but he could n't get out . He could n't get out because it was n't mud at all . It was . . . something else . He stood there , looking around fruitlessly for something to grab onto , almost laughing at the idiocy of having walked right into a patch of quicksand while looking for a place to take a piss . He stood there , at first positive that it must be a shallow patch of quicksand , at the very worst over his boot-tops , another tale to tell when he was found . He stood there , and real panic did not begin to set in until the quicksand oozed implacably over his knees . He began to struggle then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you were supposed to remain very still . In no time at all the quicksand was up to his waist and now it was chest-high , sucking at him like great brown lips , constricting his breathing ; he began to scream and no one came , nothing came except for a fat brown squirrel that picked its way down the side of the mossy deadfall and perched on his pack and watched him with his bright , black eyes . Now it was up to his neck , the rich , brown smell of it in his nose and his screams became thin and gasping as the quicksand implacably pressed the breath out of him . Birds flew swooping and cheeping and scolding , and green shafts of sunlight like tarnished copper fell through the trees , and the quicksand rose over his chin . Alone , he was going to die alone , and he opened his mouth to scream one last time and there was no scream because the quicksand flowed into his mouth , it flowed over his tongue , it flowed between his teeth in thin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never utteredJohnny had come out of that in a cold sweat , his flesh marbled into goosebumps , the scarf wrapped tightly between his hands , his breath coming in short , strangled gasps . He had thrown the scarf on the floor where it lay like a twisted white snake . He would not touch it again . His father had put it in a return envelope and sent it back . But now , mercifully , the mail was beginning to taper off . The crazieshad discovered some fresher object for their public and private obsessions . Newsmen no longer called for interviews , partly because the phone number had been changed and unlisted , partly because the story was old hat.  |p197Roger  Dussault had written a long and angry piece for his paper , of which he was the feature editor . He proclaimed the whole thing a cruel and tasteless hoax . Johnny had undoubtedly boned up on incidentsfrom the pasts of several reporters who were likely to attend the press conference , just in case . Yes , he admitted , his sister Anne 's nicknamehad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amphetamines might have been a contributing cause . But all of that was accessible information to anyone who wanted to dig it up . He made it all seem quite logical . The article did not explain how Johnny , who had not been out of the hospital , could have come by this " accessible information , " but that was a point most readers seemed to have overlooked . Johnny could not have cared less . The incident was closed , and he had no intention of creating new ones . What good could it possibly do to write the lady who had sent the scarf and tell her that her brother had drowned , screaming , in quicksand because he had gone the wrong way while looking for a place to take a piss ? Would it ease her mind or help her live her life any better ? Today 's mail was a mere six letters . A power bill . A card from Herb 's cousin out in Oklahoma . A lady who had sent Johnny a crucifixwith MADE IN TAIWAN stamped on Christ 's feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Sam Weizak . And a small envelopewith a return address that made him blink and sit up straighter . S. Hazlett , 12 Pond Street , Bangor . Sarah . He tore it open . Ile had received a sympathy card from her two days after the funeral services for his mother . Written on the back of it in her cool , backslantinghand had been : " Johnny  --  I 'm so sorry that this has happened . I heard on the radio that your mom had passed away  --  in some ways that seemed the most unfair thing of all , that your private grief should have been made a thing of public knowledge . You may not remember , but we talked a little about your mom the night of your accident . I asked you what she 'd do if you brought home a lapsed Catholic and you said she would smile and welcome me in and slip me a few tracts . I could see your love for her in the way you smiled . I know from your father that she had changed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so much and just could n't accept what hadp198happened . And in the end I guess her faith was rewarded . Please accept my warm sympathy , and if there 's anything I can do , now or later on , please count on your friend  --  Sarah . " That was one note he had answered , thanking her for both the card and the thought . He had written it carefully , afraid that he might betrayhimself and say the wrong thing . She was a married woman now , that was beyond his control or ability too change . But he did remember their conversation about his mother  --  and so many other things about that night . Her note had summoned up the whole evening , and he answered in a bittersweet mood that was more bitter than sweet . He still loved Sarah Bracknell , and he had to remind himself constantlythat she was gone , replaced by another woman who was five years older and the mother of a small boy . Now he pulled a single sheet of stationery out of the envelope and scanned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Kennebunk to spend a week with Sarah 's freshman and sophomore roommate , a girl named Stephanie Constantine now , Stephanie Carsleigh then . She said that Johnny might remember her , but Johnny did n't . Anyway , Walt was stuck in Washington for three weeks on combined firm and Republican party business , and Sarah thought she might take one afternoon and come by Pownal to see Johnny and Herb , if it was no trouble . " You can reach me at Steph 's number , 814-6219 , any time between Oct. 17th and the 23rd . Of course , if it would make you feel uncomfortable in any way , just call me and say so , either up here or down there in K'bunk . I 'll understand . Much love to both of you  --  Sarah . " Holding the letter in one hand , Johnny looked across the yard and into the woods , which had gone russet and gold , seemingly just in the last week . The leaves would be falling soon , and then it would be time for winter . Much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his thumb across the words thoughtfully . It would be better not to call , not to write , not to do anything , he thought . She would get the message . Like the woman who mailed the scarf  --  what possible good could it do ? Why kick a sleeping dog ? Sarah might be able to use that phrase , much love , blithely , but he could not . He was n't over the hurt of the past . Forp199him , time had been crudely folded , stapled , and mutilated . In the progression of his own interior time , she had been his girl only six months ago . He could accept the coma and the loss of time in an intellectualway , but his emotions stubbornly resisted . Answering her condolence note had been difficult , but with a note it was always possible to crumple the thing up and start again if it began to go in directionsit should n't go , if it began to overstep the bounds of friendship , which was all they were now allowed to share . If he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Better not to call . Better just to let it sink . But he would call , he thought . Call and invite her over . Troubled , he slipped the note back into the envelope . The sun caught on bright chrome , twinkled there , and tossed an arrow of light back into his eyes . A Ford sedan was crunching its way down the driveway . Johnny squinted and tried to make out if it was a familiar car . Company out here was rare . There had been lots of mail , but people had only stopped by on three or four occasions . Pownal was small on the map , hard to find . If the car did belong to some seeker after knowledge , Johnny would send him or her away quickly , is kindly as possible , but firmly . That had been Weizak 's parting advice . Good advice , Johnny thought . " Do n't let anyone rope you into the role of consulting swami , John . Give no encouragement and they will forget . It may seem heartless to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with too many problems and only the best of intentions  --  but it is a question of your life , your privacy . So be firm . " And so he had been . The Ford pulled into the turnaround between the shed and the woodpile , and as it swung around , Johnny saw the small Hertz sticker In the corner of the windshield . A very tall man in very new blue jeans and a red plaid hunting shirt that looked as if it had just come out of in I. L. Bean box got out of the car and glanced around . He had the sat of a man who is not used to the country , a man who knows there are no more wolves or cougars in New England , but who wants to make sure all the same . A city man . He glanced up at the porch , saw Johnny , and raised one hand in greeting . " Good afternoon , " he said . He had a flat city accent as wellp200Brooklyn , Johnny thought  --  and he sounded as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Johnny said . " Lost ? " " Boy , I hope not , " the stranger said , coming over to the foot of the steps . " You 're either John Smith or his twin brother . " Johnny grinned . " I do n't have a brother , so I guess you found your way to the right door . Can I do something for you ? " " Well , maybe we can do something for each other . " The stranger mounted the porch steps and offered his hand . Johnny shook it . " My name is Richard Dees . Inside View magazine . " His hair was cut in a fashionable ear-length style , and it was mostly gray . Dyed gray , Johnny thought with some amusement . What could you say about a man who sounded as if he were talking through a Saltinebox and dyed his hair gray ? " Maybe you 've seen the magazine . " " Oh , I 've seen it .

" " Really , I ... " " Mr. Smith , I 've flown all the way up from New York , and from Boston I came on a little plane that had me wondering what would happen to my wife if I died intestate . " " Portland-Bangor Airways ? " Johnny asked , grinning . " That 's what it was , " Dees agreed . " All right , " Johnny said . " I 'm impressed with your valor and your dedication to your job . I 'll listen , but only for fifteen minutes or so . I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small lie in a good cause.  | " Fifteen minutes should be more than enough . " Dees leaned forward . " I 'm just making an educated guess , Mr. Smith , but I 'd estimatethat you must owe somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundredthousand dollars . That roll somewhere within putting distance of the pin , does it ? " Johnny 's smile thinned . " What I owe or do n't owe , " he said , " is my business . " " All right , of course , sure . I did n't mean to offend , Mr. Smith . Inside View would like to offer you a job . A rather lucrative job . " " No . Absolutely not . " " If you 'll just give me a chance to lay this out for you . . . " Johnny said , " I 'm not a practicing psychic . I 'm not a Jeane Dixon or an Edgar Cayce or an Alex Tannous . That 's over with . The last thing I want to do is rake it up again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Mr. Dees , you do n't seem to understand what I 'm ... " " Just a few moments ? " Dees smiled winningly . " How did you find out where I was , anyway ? " " We have a stringer on a mid-Maine paper called the Kennebec Journal . He said that although you 'd dropped out of the public view , you were probably staying with your father . " " Well , I owe him a real debt of thanks , do n't I ? " " Sure , " Dees said easily . " I 'm betting you 'll think so when you hear the whole deal . May I ? " " All right , " Johnny said . " But just because you flew up here on Panic Airlines , I 'm not going to change my mind . " " Well , however you see it . It 's a free country , is n't it ? Sure it is . InsideView specializes in a psychic view of things , Mr. Smith , as you probably know .

" " Twin Babies Eaten By Killer Bear , " Johnny murmured . Dees shrugged . " Sure , well , it 's a tough old world , is n't it ? Peoplep202have to be informed about these things . It 's their right to know . But for every downbeat article we 've got three others telling our readers how to lose weight painlessly , how to find sexual happiness and compatibility , how to get closer to God ... " " Do you believe in God , Mr. Dees ? " " Actually , I do n't , " Dees said , and smiled his winning smile . " But we live in a democracy , greatest country on earth , right ? Everyone is the captain of his own soul . No , the point is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and miracles ... " " And exorcisms and devils and Black Masses . . . " " Right , right , right . You catch . It 's a spiritual audience . They believe all this psychic bushwah . We have a total of ten psychics under contract , including Kathleen Nolan , the most famous seer in America . We 'd like to put you under contract , Mr. Smith . " " Would you ? " " Indeed we would . What would it mean for you ? Your picture and a short column would appear roughly twelve times a year , when we run one of our All-Psychic issues . Inside View 's Ten Famous Psychics Preview the Second Ford Administration , that sort of thing . We always do a New Year 's issue , and one each Fourth of July on the course of America over the next year  --  that 's always a very informative issue , lots of chip shots on foreign policy and economic policy in that one  --  plus assorted other goodies . " " I do n't think you understand , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if to a child . " I 've had a couple of precognitive bursts  --  I suppose you could say I saw the future '  --  but I do n't have any control over it . I could no more come up with a prediction for the second Ford administration  --  if there ever is one  --  than I could milk a bull . " Dees looked horrified . " Who said you could ? Staff writers do all those columns . " " Staff ... ? " Johnny gaped at Dees , finally shocked . " Of course , " Dees said impatiently . " Look . One of our most popularguys over the last couple of years has been Frank Ross , the guy who specializes in natural disasters . Hell of a nice guy , but Jesus Christ , he quit school in the ninth grade . He did two hitches in the Army and was swamping out Greyhound buses at the Port Authority terminal inp203New York when we found him . You think we 'd let him write his own column ? He 'd misspell cat . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand , nothing but a free hand . But you 'd be surprised how often these guys and gals get stuck for a real whopper . " " Whopper , " Johnny repeated , bemused . He was a little surprised to find himself getting angry . His mother had bought Inside View for as long as he could remember , all the way back to the days when they had featured pictures of bloody car wrecks , decapitations , and bootleggedexecution photos . She had sworn by every word . Presumably the greater part of Inside View 's other 2,999,999 readers did as well . And here sat this fellow with his dyed gray hair and his forty-dollar shoes and his shirt with the store-creases still in it , talking about whoppers . " But it all works out , " Dees was saying . " If you ever get stuck , all you have to do is call us collect and we all take it into the pro-shop together and come up with something . We have the right to anthologizeyour columns in our yearly book , Inside Views @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sign any contract you can get with a book publisher , however . All we get is first refusal on the magazine rights , and we hardly ever refuse , I can tell you . And we pay very handsomely . That 's over and above whatever figure we contract for . Gravy on your mashed potatoes , you might say . " Dees chuckled . " And what might that figure be ? " Johnny asked slowly . He was gripping the arms of his rocker . A vein in his right temple pulsed rhythmically . " Thirty thousand dollars per year for two years , " Dees said . " And if you prove popular , that figure would become negotiable . Now , all our psychics have some area of expertise . I understand that you 're good with objects . " Dees 's eyes became half-lidded , dreamy . " I sec a regular feature . Twice monthly , maybe  --  we do n't want to run a good thing into the ground . John Smith invites Inside View-ers to send in personal belongings for psychic examination ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of course , that they should send in inexpensive stuff because nothing could be returned . But you 'd be surprised . Some people arc crazy as bedbugs , God love cm . You 'd be surprised at somep204of the stuff that would come in . Diamonds , gold coins , wedding rings ... and we could attach a rider to the contract specifying that all objectsmailed in would become your personal property . " Now Johnny began to see tones of dull red before his eyes . " People would send things in and I 'd just keep them . That 's what you 're saying . " " Sure , I do n't see any problem with that . It 's just a question of keeping the ground rules clear up front . A little extra gravy for those mashed potatoes . " " Suppose , " Johnny said , carefully keeping his voice even and modulated , " suppose I got . . . stuck for a whopper , as you put it ... and I just called in and said President Ford was going to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt he was , but because I was stuck ? " " Well , September only has thirty days , you know , " Dees said . " But otherwise , I think it 's a hole in one . You 're going to be a natural , Johnny . You think big . That 's good . You 'd be surprised how many of these people think small . Afraid to put their mouths where their money is , I suppose . One of our guys  --  Tim Clark out in Idaho  --  wrote in two weeks ago and said he 'd had a flash that Earl Butz was going to be forced to resign next year . Well pardon my French , but who gives a fuck ? Who 's Earl Butz to the American housewife ? But you have good waves , Johnny . You were made for this stuff . " " Good waves , " Johnny muttered . Dees was looking at him curiously . " You feel all right , Johnny ? You look a little white . " Johnny was thinking of the lady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ View , too . " Let me see if I can summarize this , " he said . " You 'd pay me thirty thousand dollars a year for my name ... " " And your picture , do n't forget . " " And my picture , for a few ghost-written columns . Also a feature where I tell people what they want to know about objects they send in . As an extra added attraction , I get to keep the stuff ... " " If the lawyers can work it out ... " " ... as my personal property . That the deal ? " " That 's the bare bones of the deal , Johnny . The way these things feedp205each other , it 's just amazing . You 'll be a household word in six months , and after that , the sky is the limit . The Carson show . Personal appearances . Lecture tours . Your book , of course , pick your house , they 're practically throwing money at psychics along Publisher 's Row . Kathy Nolan started with a contract like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over two hundred thou a year now . Also , she founded her own church and the IRS ca n't touch dime-one of her money . She does n't miss a trick , does our Kathy . " Dees leaned forward , grinning . " I tell you , Johnny , the sky is the limit . " " I 'll bet . " " Well ? What do you think ? " Johnny leaned forward toward Dees . He grabbed the sleeve of I ) ees 's new L.L. Bean shirt in one hand and the collar of Dees 's new L.L. Bean shirt in the other . " Hey ! What the hell do you think you 're d ... " Johnny bunched the shirt in both hands and drew Dees forward . Five months of daily exercise had toned up the muscles in his hands and arms to a formidable degree . " You asked me what I thought , " Johnny said . His head was beginning to throb and ache . " I 'll tell you . I think you 're a ghoul . A grave robber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put you to work at Roto-Rooter . I think your mother should have died of cancer the day after she conceived you . If there 's a hell , I hope you burn there . " " You ca n't talk to me like that ! " Dees cried . His voice rose to a fishwife 's shriek . " You 're fucking crazy ! Forget it ! Forget the whole thing , you stupid hick sonofabitch ! You had your chance ! Do n't come crawling around . . . " " Furthermore , you sound like you 're talking through a Saltine box , " Johnny said , standing up . He lifted Dees with him . The tails of his shirt popped out of the waistband of his new jeans , revealing a fishnet undershirt beneath . Johnny began to shake Dees methodically back and forth . Dees forgot about being angry . He began to blubber and roar . Johnny dragged him to the porch steps , raised one foot , and planted it squarely in the seat of the new Levi 's . Dees went down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He fell in the dirt and sprawledp206full-length . When he got up and turned around to face Johnny , his country-cousin duds were caked with dooryard dust . It made them look more real , somehow , Johnny thought , but doubted if Dees would appreciate that . " I ought to put the cops on you , " he said hoarsely . " And maybe I will . " " You do whatever turns you on , " Johnny said . " But the law around here does n't take too kindly to people who stick their noses in where they have n't been invited . " Dees 's face worked in an uneasy contortion of fear , anger , and shock . " God help you if you ever need us , " he said . Johnny 's head was aching fiercely now , but he kept his voice even . " That 's just right , " he said . " I could n't agree more . " " You 're going to be sorry , you know . Three million readers . That cuts both ways . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ countrywould n't believe you if you predicted spring in April . They would n't believe you if you said the World Series is going to come in October . They would n't believe you if ... if . . . " Dees spluttered , furious . " Get out of here , you cheap cocksucker , " Johnny said . " You can kiss of that book ! " Dees screamed , apparently summoning up the worst thing he could think of . With his working , knotted face and his dust-caked shirt , he looked like a kid having a class-A tantrum . His Brooklyn accent had deepened and darkened to the point where it was almost a patois . " They 'll laugh you out of every publishing house in New York ! Nightstand Readers would n't touch you when I get done with you ! There are ways of fixing smart guys like you and we got em , fuckhead ! We ... " " I guess I 'll go get my Remmy and shoot myself a trespasser , " Johnny remarked . Dees retreated to his rental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the porch and watched him , his head thudding sickly . Dees got in , revved the car 's engine mercilessly , and then screamed out , throwing dirt into the air in clouds . He let the car drift just enough on his way out to knock the chopping block by the shed flying . Johnny grinned a little at that in spite of his bad head . Hep207could set up the chopping block a lot more easily than Dees was going to be able to explain the big dent in that Ford 's front fender to the Hertz people . Afternoon sun twinkled on chrome again as Dees sprayed gravel all the way up the driveway to the road . Johnny sat down in the rocker again and put his forehead in his hand and got ready to wait out the headache . " You 're going to do what ? " the banker asked . Outside and below , traffic passed back and forth along the bucolic main street of Ridgeway , New Hampshire . On the walls of the banker 's pine-panelled , third-floor office were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ functions . On his desk was a lucite cube , and embedded in this cube were pictures of his wife and his son . " I 'm going to run for the House of Representatives next year , " Greg Stillson repeated . He was dressed in khaki suntan pants , a blue shirt with the sleeves rolled up , and a black tie with a single blue figure . He looked out of place in the banker 's office , somehow , as if at any moment he might rise to his feet and begin an aimless , destructive charge around the room , knocking over furniture , sweeping the expensivelyframed Remington prints to the floor , pulling the drapes from their rods . The banker , Charles " Chuck " Gendron , president of the local Lions Club , laughed  --  a bit uncertainly . Stillson had a way of making people feel uncertain . As a boy he had been scrawny , perhaps ; he liked to tell people that " a high wind woulda blowed me away " ; but in the end his father 's genes had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he looked very much like the Oklahoma oilfield roughneck that his father had been . He frowned at Gendron 's chuckle . " I mean , George Harvey might have something to say about that , might n't he , Greg ? " George Harvey , besides being a mover and a shaker in town politics , was the third district Republican godfather . " George wo n't say boo , " Greg said calmly . There was a salting of gray in his hair , but his face suddenly looked very much like the facep208of the man who long ago had kicked a dog to death in an Iowa farmyard . His voice was patient . " George is going to be on the sidelines , but he 's gon na be on my side of the sidelines , if you get my meaning . I ai n't going to be stepping on his toes , because I 'm going to run as an independent . I do n't have twenty years to spend learning the ropes and licking boots . " Chuck Gendron said hesitantly , " You 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's frown returned . It was forbidding . " Chuck , I never kid . People ... they think I kid . The Union-Leader and those yo-yos on the Daily Democrat , they think I kid . But you go see George Harvey . You ask him if I kid around , or if I get the job done . You ought to know better , too . After all , we buried some bodies together , did n't we , Chuck ? " The frown metamorphosed into a somehow chilling grin  --  chilling to Gendron , perhaps , because he had allowed himself to be pulled along on a couple of Greg Stillson 's development schemes . They had made money , yes , of course they had , that was n't the problem . But there had been a couple of aspects of the Sunningdale Acres development ( and the Laurel Estates deal as well , to be honest ) that had n't been  --  well , strictly legal . A bribed EPA agent for one thing , but that was n't the worst thing . On the Laurel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Back Ridgeway Road who had n't wanted to sell , and first the old man 's fourteen-or-so chickens had died of some mysterious ailment and second there had been a fire in the old man 's potato house and third when the old man came back from visiting his sister , who was in a nursing home in Keene , one weekend not so long ago , someone had smeared dogshit all over the old man 's living room and dining room and fourth the old man had sold and fifth Laurel Estates was now a fact of life . And , maybe sixth : That motorcycle spook , Sonny Elliman , was hanging around again . He and Greg were good buddies , and the only thing that kept that from being town gossip was the counterbalancing fact that Greg was seen in the company of a lot of heads , hippies , freaks , and cyclists  --  as a direct result of the Drug Counselling Centerp209he had set up , plus Ridgeway 's rather unusual program for young drug , alcohol , and road offenders . Instead of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out their services in trade . It had been Greg 's idea  --  and a good one , the banker would be the first to admit . It had been one of the things that had helped Greg to get elected mayor . But this  --  this was utter craziness . Greg had said something else . Gendron was n't sure what . " Pardon me , " he said . " I asked you how you 'd like to be my campaign manager , " Greg repeated . " Greg . . . " Gendron had to clear his throat and start again . " Greg , you do n't seem to understand . Harrison Fisher is the Third District representative in Washington . Harrison Fisher is Republican , respected , and probably eternal . " " No one is eternal , " Greg said . " Harrison is damn close , " Gendron said . " Ask Harvey . They went to school together . Back around 1800 , I think . " Greg took no notice of this thin witticism . " I 'll call myself a Bull @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kidding around ... and in the end , the good people of the Third District are going to laugh me all the way to Washington . " " Greg , you 're crazy . " Greg 's smile disappeared as if it had never been there . Something frightening happened to his face . It became very still , and his eyes widened to show too much of the whites . They were like the eyes of a horse that smells - bad water . " You do n't want to say something like that , Chuck . Ever . " The banker felt more than chilled now . " Greg , I apologize . It 's just that ... " " No , you do n't ever want to say that to me , unless you want to find Sonny Elliman waiting for you some afternoon when you go out to get your big fucking Imperial . " Gendron 's mouth moved but no sound came out . Greg smiled again , and it was like the sun suddenly breaking through threatening clouds . " Never mind . We do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working together . "  | " Greg " I want you because you know every damn businessman in this part of New Hampshire . We 're gon na have plenty good money once we get this thing rolling , but I figure we 'll have to prime the pump . Now 's the time for me to expand a little , and start looking like the state 's man as well as Ridgeway 's man . I figure fifty thousand dollars ought to be enough to fertilize the grass roots . " The banker , who had worked for Harrison Fisher in his last four canvasses , was so astounded by Greg 's political naivete that at first he was at a loss on how to proceed . At last he said , " Greg . Businessmen contribute to campaigns not out of the goodness of their hearts but because the winner ends up owing them something . In a close campaignthey 'll contribute to any candidate who has a chance of winning , because they can write off the loser as a tax loss as well . But the operant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . " " Shoo-in , " Greg supplied . He produced an envelope from his back pocket . " Want you to look at these . " Gendron looked doubtfully at the envelope , then up at Greg . Greg nodded encouragingly . The banker opened the envelope . There was a long silence in the pine-panelled office after Gendron 's initial harsh gasp for breath . It was unbroken except for the faint hum of the digital clock on the banker 's desk and the hiss of a match as Greg lit a Phillies cheroot . On the walls of the office were Frederick Remington pictures . In the lucite cube were family pictures . Now , spread on the desk , were pictures of the banker with his head buried between the thighs of a young woman with black hair  --  or it might have been red , the pictures were high-grain black-and-white glossies and it was hard to tell . The woman 's face was very clear . It was not the face of the banker 's wife . Some residents of Ridgeway would have recognizedit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Strang 's truckstoptwo towns over . The pictures of the banker with his head between the legs of the waitress were the safe ones  --  her face was clear but his was not . In others , his own grandmother would have recognized him . There were pictures of Gendron and the waitress involved in a whole medley of sexual delights  --  hardly all the positions of the Kama Sutra , but therep211were several positions represented that had never made the " Sexual Relationships " chapter of the Ridgeway High health textbook . Gendron looked up , his face cheesy , his hands trembling . His heart was gallcting in his chest . He feared a heart attack . Greg was not even looking at him . He was looking out the window at the bright blue slice of October sky visible between the Ridgeway Five and Ten and the Ridgeway Card and Notion Shoppe . " The winds of change have started to blow , " he said , and his face was distant and preoccupied ; almost mystical . He looked back at Gendron . " One of those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave me ? " Chuck Gendron shook his head numbly . With one of his shaking hands he was massaging the left side of his chest  --  just in case . His eyes kept falling to the photographs . The damning photographs . What if his secretary came in right now ? He stopped massaging his chest and began gathering up the pictures , stuffing them back into the envelope . " He gave me Chairman Mao 's little red book , " Greg said . A chuckle rumbled up from the barrel chest that had once been so thin , part of a body that had mostly disgusted his idolized father . " And one of the proverbs in there ... I ca n't remember exactly how it went , but it was something like , The man who senses the wind of change should build not a windbreak but a windmill . ' That was the flavor of it , anyway . " He leaned forward . " Harrison Fisher 's not a shoo-in , he 's a has-been . Ford is a has-been . Muskie 's a has-been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and state politicians all the way across this country are going to wake up the day after election day and find out that they 're as dead as dodo birds . They forced Nixon out , and the next year they forced out the people who stood behind him in the impeachment hearings , and next year they 'll force out Jerry Ford for the same reason . " Greg Stillson 's eyes blazed at the banker . " You want to see the wave of the future ? Look up in Maine at this guy Longley . The Republicans ran a guy named Erwin and the Democratsran a guy named Mitchell and when they counted the votes for governor , they both got a big surprise , because the people went andp212elected themselves an insurance man from Lewiston that did n't want any part of either party . Now they 're talking about him as a dark horse candidate for president . " Gendron still could n't talk . Greg drew in his breath . " They 're all gon na think I 'm kiddin , see ? They thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm building windmills . And you 're gon na supply the building materials . " He ceased . Silence fell in the office , except for the hum of the clock . At last Gendron whispered , " Where did you get these pictures ? Was it that Elliman ? " " Aw , hey . You do n't want to talk about that . You forget all about those pictures . Keep them . " " And who keeps the negatives ? " " Chuck , " Greg said earnestly , " you do n't understand . I 'm offering you Washington . Sky 's the limit , boy ! I 'm not even asking you to raise that much money . Like I said , just a bucket of water to help prime the pump . When we get rolling , plenty of money is going to come in . Now , you know the guys that have money . You have lunch with them down at the Caswell House . You play poker with them . You have written them commercial loans tied to the prime rate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know how to put an armlock on them . " " Greg you do n't understand , you do n't ... " Greg stood up at him . His eyes rolled helplessly . Greg Stillsonthought he looked like a sheep that had been led neatly to the slaughter . " Fifty thousand dollars , " he said . " You find it . " He walked out , closing the door gently behind him . Gendron heard his booming voice even through the thick walls , bandying with his secretary . His secretary was a sixty-year-old flat-chested biddy , and Stillson probably had her giggling like a schoolgirl . He was a buffoon . It was that as much as his programs for coping with youthful crime that had ' made him mayor of Ridgeway . But the people did n't elect buffoons to Washington . Well  --  hardly ever.  |p213That  was n't his problem . Fifty thousand dollars in campaign contributions , that was his problem . His mind began to scurry around the problem like a trained white rat scurrying around a piece of cheese on a plate . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably be done  --  but would it end there ? The white envelope was still on his desk . His smiling wife looked at it from her place in the lucite cube . He scooped the envelope up and jammed it into the inner pocket of his suitcoat . It had been Elliman , somehow Elliman had found out and had taken the pictures , he was sure of it . But it had been Stillson who told him what to do . Maybe the man was n't such a buffoon after all . His assessment of the political climate of 1975-76 was n't completely stupid . Building windmills instead of windbreaks ... the sky 's the limit . But that was n't his problem . Fifty thousand dollars was his problem . Chuck Gendron , president of the Lions and all-round good fellow ( last year he had ridden one of those small , funny motorcycles in the Ridgeway Fourth of July parade ) , pulled a yellow legal tablet out of the top drawer of his desk and began jotting down a list of names . The trained white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stillson turned his face up into the strong autumn sunlight and congratulated himself on a job well-done  --  or well-begun . Later , Johnny supposed that the reason he ended up finally making love to Sarah  --  almost five years to the day after the fair  --  had a lot to do with the visit of Richard Dees , the man from Inside View . The reason he finally weakened and called Sarah and invited her to come and visit was little more than a wistful urge to have someone nice come to call and take the nasty taste out of his mouth . Or so he told himself.  |p214He  called her in Kennebunk and got the former roommate , who said Sarah would be right with him . The phone clunked down and there was a moment of silence when he contemplated ( but not very seriously ) just hanging up and closing the books for good . Then Sarah 's voice was in his ear . " Johnny ? Is it you ? " " The very same . " " How are you ? " " Fine . How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said . " Glad you called . I ... did n't know if you would . " " Still sniffin that wicked cocaine ? " " No , I 'm on heroin now . " " You got your boy with you ? " " I sure do . Do n't go anywhere without him . " " Well , why do n't the two of you truck on out here some day before you have to go back up north ? " " I 'd like that , Johnny , " she said warmly . " Dad 's working in Westbrook and I 'm chief cook and bottlewasher . He gets home around four-thirty and we eat around fivethirty . You 're welcome to stay for dinner , but be warned : all my best dishes use Franco-American spaghetti as their base . " She giggled . " Invitation accepted . Which day is best ? " " What about tomorrow or the day after , Sarah ? " " Tomorrow 's fine , " she said after the briefest of hesitations . " See you then . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too . " He hung up thoughtfully , feeling both excited and guilty  --  for no good reason at all . But your mind went where it wanted to , did n't it ? And where his mind wanted to go now was to examine possibilities maybe best left unconsidered . Well , she knows the thing she needs to know . She knows what time dad comes home  --  what the does she need to know ? And his mind answered itself : What you going to do if she shows up atnoon ?  |p215Nothing  , he answered , and did n't wholly believe it . Just thinking about Sarah , the set of her lips , the small , upward tilt of her green eyes  --  those were enough to make him feel weak and sappy and a little desperate . Johnny went out to the kitchen and slowly began to put together this night 's supper , not so important , just for two . Father and son batching it . It had n't been all that bad . He was still healing . He and his father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about his mother  --  working around that carefully but always seeming to come a little closer to the center , in a tightening spiral . Not needingto understand , maybe , but needing to come to terms . No , it had n't been that bad . It was a way to finish putting things together . For both of them . But it would be over in January when he returned to Cleaves Mills to teach . He had gotten his half-year contract from Dave Pelsen the week before , had signed it and sent it back . What would his father do then ? Go on , Johnny supposed . People had a way of doing that , just going on , pushing through with no particular drama , no big drumrolls . He would get down to visit Herb as often as he could , every weekend , if that felt like the right thing to do . So many things had gotten strange so fast that all he could do was feel his way slowly along , groping like a blind man in an unfamiliar room . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the living room , snapped on the TV , then snapped it off again . He sat down and thought about Sarah . The baby , he thought . The baby will be our chaperon if she comes early . So that was all right , after all . All bases covered . But his thoughts were still long and uneasily speculative . She came at quarter past twelve the next day , wheeling a snappy little red Pinto into the driveway and parking it , getting out , looking tall and beautiful , her dark blonde hair caught in the mild October wind . " Hi , Johnny ! " she called , raising her hand . " Sarah ! " He came down to meet her ; she lifted her face and he kissed her cheek lightly . " Just let me get the emperor , " she said , opening the passenger door . " Can I help ? "  | " Navy , we get along just fine together , do n't we , Denny ? Come on , kiddo . " Moving deftly , she unbuckled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She lifted him out . Denny stared around the yard with wild , solemn interest , and then his eyes fixed on Johnny and held there . He smiled . " Vig ! " Denny said , and waved both hands . " I think he wants to go to you , " Sarah said . " Very unusual . Denny has his father 's Republican sensibilities  --  he 's rather standoffish . Want to hold him ? " " Sure , " Johnny said , a little doubtfully . Sarah grinned . " He wo n't break and you wo n't drop him , " she said , and handed Denny over . " If you did , he 'd probably bounce right up like Silly Putty . Disgustingly fat baby . " " Vun bunk ! " Denny said , curling one arm nonchalantly around Johnny 's neck and looking comfortably at his mother . " It really is amazing , " Sarah said . " He never takes to people like .. . Johnny ? Johnny ? " When the baby put his arm around Johnny 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him like mild warm water . There was nothing dark , nothing troubling . Everything was very simple . There was no concept of the future in the baby 's thoughts . No feeling of trouble . No sense of past unhappiness . And no words , only strong images : warmth , dryness , the mother , the man that was himself . " Johnny ? " She was looking at him apprehensively . " Hmmmm ? " " Is everything all right ? " She 's asking me about Denny , he realized . Is everything all right with Denny ? Do you see trouble ? Problems ? " Everything 's fine , " he said . " We can go inside if you want , but I usually roost on the porch . It 'll be time to crouch around the stove all day long soon enough . " " I think the porch will be super . And Denny looks as if he 'd like to try out the yard . Great yard , he says . Right , kiddo ? " She ruffled his hair and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " As long as he does n't try to eat any of those woodchips. "  | " I 've been splitting stove-lengths , " Johnny said , setting Denny down as carefully as a Ming vase . " Good exercise . " " How are you ? Physically ? " " I think , " Johnny said , remembering the heave-ho he had given Richard Dees a few days ago , " that I 'm doing as well as could be expected . " " That 's good . You were kinda low the last time I saw you . " Johnny nodded . " The operations . " " Johnny ? " He glanced at her and again felt that odd mix of speculation , guilt , and something like anticipation in his viscera . Her eyes were on his face , frankly and openly . " Yeah ? " " Do you remember ... about the wedding ring ? " He nodded . " It was there . Where you said it would be . I threw it away . " " Did you ? " He was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mentioned it to Walt . " She shook her head . " And I do n't know why . It 's bothered me ever since . " " Do n't let it . " They were standing on the steps , facing each other . Color had come up in her cheeks , but she did n't drop her eyes . " There 's something I 'd like to finish , " she said simply . " Something we never had the chance to finish . " " Sarah . . . " he began , and stopped . He had absolutely no idea what to say next . Below them , Denny tottered six steps and then sat down hard . He crowed , not put out of countenence at all . " Yes , " she said . " I do n't know if it 's right or wrong . I love Walt . He 's a good man , easy to love . Maybe the one thing I know is a good man from a bad one . Dan  --  that guy I went with in college  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mouth for the other kind , Johnny . Without you , I never could have appreciated Walt for what he is . " " Sarah , you do n't have to . . . " " I do have to , " Sarah contradicted . Her voice was low and intense . " Because things like this you can only say once . And you either get itp218wrong or right , it 's the end either way , because it 's too hard to ever try to say again . " She looked at him pleadingly . " Do you understand ? " " Yes , I suppose I do . " " I love you , Johnny , " she said . " I never stopped . I 've tried to tell myself that it was an act of God that split us up . I do n't know . Is a bad hot dog an act of God ? Or two kids dragging on a back road in the middle of the night ? All I want ... " Her voice had taken on a peculiarflat emphasis that seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an artisan 's small hammer into thin and precious foil , " ... all I want is what was taken from us . " Her voice faltered . She looked down . " And I want it with all my heart , Johnny . Do you ? " " Yes , " he said . He put his arms out and was confused when she shook her head and stepped away . " Not in front of Denny , " she said . " It 's stupid , maybe , but that would be a little bit too much like public infidelity . I want everything , Johnny . " Her color rose again , and her pretty blush began to feed his own excitement . " I want you to hold me and kiss me and love me , " she said . Her voice faltered again , nearly broke . " I think it 's wrong , but I ca n't help it . It 's wrong but it 's right . It 's fair . " He reached out one finger and brushed away a tear that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only this once , is n't it ? " She nodded . " Once will have to put paid to everything . Everything that would have been , if things had n't gone wrong . " She looked up , her eyes brighter green than ever , swimming with tears . " Can we put paid to everything with only the one time , Johnny ? " " No , " he said , smiling . " But we can try , Sarah . " She looked fondly down at Denny , who was trying to climb up onto the chopping block without much success . " He 'll sleep , " she said . They sat on the porch and watched Denny play in the yard under the high blue sky . There was no hurry , no impatience between them , but there was a growing electricity that they both felt . She had opened her coat and sat on the porch glider in a powder-blue wool dress , herp219ankles crossed , her hair blown carelessly on her shoulders where the wind had spilled it . The blush never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across the sky , west to east . They talked of inconsequential things  --  there was no hurry . For the first time since he had come out of it , Johnny felt that time was not his enemy . Time had provided them with this little air pocket in exchangefor the main flow of which they had been robbed , and it would be here for as long as they needed it . They talked about people who had been married , about a girl from Cleaves Mills who had won a Merit scholarship , about Maine 's independent governor . Sarah said he looked like Lurch on the old Addams Family show and thought like Herbert Hoover , and they both laughed over that . " Look at him , " Sarah said , nodding toward Denny . He was sitting on the grass by Vera Smith 's ivy trellis , his thumb in his mouth , looking at them sleepily . She got his car-bed out of the Pinto 's back seat . " Will he be okay on the porch ? " she asked Johnny . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him nap in the fresh air . " " He 'll be fine on the porch , " Johnny said . She set the bed in the shade , popped him into it , and pulled the two blankets up to his chin . " Sleep , baby , " Sarah said . He smiled at her and promptly closed his eyes . " Just like that ? " Johnny asked . " Just like that , " she agreed . She stepped close to him and put her arms around his neck . Quite clearly he could hear the faint rustle of her slip beneath her dress . " I 'd like you to kiss me , " she said calmly . " I 've waited five years for you to kiss me again , Jonnny . " He put his arms around her waist and kissed her gently . Her lips parted . " Oh , Johnny , " she said against his neck . " I love you . " " I love you too , Sarah . " " Where do we go ? " she asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear and dark as emeralds now . " Where ? "  |p220He  spread the faded army blanket , which was old but clean , on the straw of the second loft . The smell was fragrant and sweet . High above them there was the mysterious coo and flutter of the barn swallows , and then they settled down again . There was a small , dusty windowwhich looked down on the house and porch . Sarah wiped a clean place on the glass and looked down at Denny . " It 's okay ? " Johnny asked . " Yes . Better here than in the house . That would have been like ... " She shrugged . " Making my dad a part of it ? " " Yes . This is between us . " " Our business . " " Our business , " she agreed . She lay on her stomach , her face turned to one side on the faded blanket , her legs bent at the knee . She pushed her shoes off , one by one . " Unzip me , Johnny . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The sound was loud in the stillness . Her back was the color of coffee with cream against the whiteness of her slip . He kissed her between the shoulder blades and she shivered . " Sarah , " he murmured . " What ? " " I have to tell you something . " " What ? " " The doctor made a mistake during one of those operations and gelded me . " She punched him on the shoulder . " Same old Johnny , " she said . " And you had a friend once who broke his neck on the crack-the-whip at Topsham Fair . " " Sure , " he said . Her hand touched him like silk , moving gently up and down . " It does n't feel like they did anything terminal to you , " she said . Her luminous eyes searched his . " Not at all . Shall we look and see ? " There was the sweet smell of the hay . Time spun out . There was therough feel of the army blanket , the smooth feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into her was like sinking into an old dream that had never been quite forgotten . " Oh , Johnny , my dear ... " Her voice in rising excitement . Her hips moving in a quickening tempo . Her voice was far away . The touch of her hair was like fire on his shoulder and chest . He plunged his face deeply into it , losing himself in that dark-blonde darkness . Time spinning out in the sweet smell of hay . The rough-textured blanket . The sound of the old b2rn creaking gently , like a ship , in the October wind . Mild white light coming in through the roof chinks , catching motes of chaff in half a hundred pencil-thin sunbeams . Motes of chaff dancing and revolving . She cried out . At some point she cried out his name , again and again and again , like a chant . Her fingers dug into him like spurs . Rider and ridden . Old wine decanted at last , a fine vintage . Later they sat by the window , looking out into the yard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left him for a little bit . He sat alone , not thinking , content to watch her reappear in the window , smaller , and cross the yard to the porch . She bent over the baby bed and readjusted the blankets . She came back , the wind blowing her hair out behind her and tugging playfully at the hem of her dress . " He 'll sleep another half hour , " she said . " Will he ? " Johnny smiled . " Maybe I will , too . " She walked her bare toes across his belly . " You better not . " And so again , and this time she was on top , almost in an attitude of prayer , her head bent , her hair swinging forward and obscuring her face . Slowly . And then it was over . " Sarah ... " " No , Johnny . Better not say it . Time 's up . " " I was going to say that you 're beautiful . " " Am I ? " " You are , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we put paid to everything ? " she asked him . Johnny smiled . " Sarah , we did the best we could . "  |p222Herb  did n't seem surprised to see Sarah when he got home from Westbrook . He welcomed her , made much of the baby , and then scolded Sarah for not bringing him down sooner . " He has your color and complexion , " Herb said . " And I think he 's going to have your eyes , when they get done changing . " " If only he has his father 's brains , " Sarah said . She had put an apron on over the blue wool dress . Outside , the sun was going down . Anothertwenty minutes and it would be dark . " You know , the cooking is supposed to be Johnny 's job , " Herb said . " Could n't stop her . She put a gun to my head . " " Well , maybe it 's all for the best , " Herb said . " Everything you make comes out tasting like Franco-American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Denny laughed , a high , piercingsound that seemed to fill the house . Can he see ? Johnny wondered . It feels like it 's written all over my face . And then a startling thought came to him as he watched his father digging in the entryway closet for a box of Johnny 's old toys that he had never let Vera give away : Maybe he understands . They ate . Herb asked Sarah what Walt was doing in Washington and she told them about the conference he was attending , which had to do with Indian land claims . The Republican meetings were mostly wind-testing exercises , she said . " Most of the people he 's meeting with think that if Reagan is nominatedover Ford next year , it 's going to mean the death of the party , " Sarah said . " And if the Grand Old Party dies , that means Walt wo n't be able to run for Bill Cohen 's seat in 1978 when Cohen goes after Bill Hathaway 's Senate seat . " Herb was watching Denny eat string beans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his teeth on them . " I do n't think Cohen will be able to wait until ' 78 to get in the Senate . He 'll run against Muskie nextyear . " " Walt says Bill Cohen 's not that big a dope , " Sarah said . " He 'll wait . Walt says his own chance is coming , and I 'm starting to believe him . "  |p223After  supper they sat in the living room , and the talk turned away from politics . They watched Denny play with the old wooden cars and trucks that a much younger Herb Smith had made for his own son over a quarter of a century ago . A younger Herb Smith who had been married to a tough , good-humored woman who would sometimes drink a bottle of Black Label beer in the evening . A man with no gray in his hair and nothing but the highest hopes for his son . He does understand , Johnny thought , sipping his coffee . Whether he knows what went on between Sarah and me this afternoon , whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he understands the basic cheat . You ca n't change it or rectify it , the best you can do is try to come to terms . This afternoon she and I consummated a marriage that never was . And tonight he 's playing with his grandson . He thought of the Wheel of Fortune , slowing , stopping . House number . Everyone loses . Gloom was trying to creep up , a dismal sense of finality , and he pushed it away . This was n't the time ; he would n't let it be the time . By eight-thirty Denny had begun to get scratchy and cross and Sarah said , " Time for us to go , folks . He can suck a bottle on our way back to Kennebunk . About three miles from here , he 'll have corked off . Thanks for having us . " Her eyes , brilliant green , found Johnny 's for a moment . " Our pleasure entirely , " Herb said , standing up . " Right , Johnny ? " " Right , " he said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " At the door , Herb kissed the top of Denny 's head ( and Denny grabbed Herb 's nose in his chubby fist and honked it hard enough to make Herb 's eyes water ) and Sarah 's cheek . Johnny carried the car-bed down to the red Pinto and Sarah gave him the keys so he could put everything in the back . When he finished , she was standing by the driver 's side door , looking at him . " It was the best we could do , " she said , and smiled a little . But the brilliance of her eyes told him the tears were close again . " It was n't so bad at all , " Johnny said . " We 'll stay in touch ? " " I do n't know , Sarah . Will we ? "  | " No . I suppose not . It would be too easy , would n't it ? " " Pretty easy , yes . " She stepped close and stretched to kiss his cheek . He could smell her hair , clean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I 'll think about you . " " Be good , Sarah , " he said , and touched her nose . She turned then , got in behind the wheel , a smart young matron whose husband was on the way up . I doubt like hell if they 'll be drivinga Pinto next year , Johnny thought . The lights came on , then the little sewing machine motor roared . She raised a hand to him and then she was pulling out of the driveway . Johnny stood by the chopping block , hands in his pockets , and watched her go . Something in his heart seemed to have closed . It was not a major feeling . That was the worst of it  --  it was n't a major feeling at all . He watched until the taillights were out of sight and then he climbed the porch steps and went back into the house . His dad was sitting in the big easy chair in the living room . The TV was off . The few toys he had found in the closet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . " Good to see Sarah , " Herb said . Did you and she have . . . " there was the briefest , most minute hesitation . . . " a nice visit ? " " Yes , " Johnny said . " She 'll be down again ? " " No , I do n't think so . " He and his father were looking at each other . " Well now , maybe that 's for the best , " Herb said finally . " Yes . Maybe so . " " You played with these toys , " Herb said , getting down on his knees and beginning to gather them up . " I gave a bunch of them to Lottie Gedreau when she had her twins , but I knew I had a few of them left . I saved a few back . " He put them back in the box one by one , turning each of them over in his hands , examining them . A race car . A bulldozer . A police car . A small hook-and-ladder truck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where a small hand would grip . He took them back to the entryway closet and put them away . Johnny did n't see Sarah Hazlett again for three years . The snow came early that year . There were six inches on the ground by November 7 , and Johnny had taken to lacing on a pair of old green gumrubber boots and wearing his old parka for the trek up to the mailbox . Two weeks before , Dave Pelsen had mailed down a package containing the texts he would be using in January , and Johnny had already begun making tentative lesson plans . He was looking forward to getting back . Dave had also found him an apartment on Howland Street in Cleaves. 24 Howland Street . Johnny kept that on a scrap of paper in his wallet , because the name and number had an irritating way of slipping his mind . On this day the skies were slatey and lowering , the temperature hovering just below the twenty-degree mark . As Johnny tramped up the driveway , the first spats of snow began to drift @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel too self-conscious about running his tongue out and trying to catch a flake on it . He was hardly limping at all , and he felt good . There had n't been a headache in two weeks or more . The mail consisted of an advertising circular , a Newsweek , and a small manila envelope addressed to John Smith , no return address . Johnny opened it on the way back , the rest of the mail stuffed into his hip pocket . He pulled out a single page of newsprint , saw the words Inside View at the top , and came to a halt halfway back to the house . It was page three of the previous week 's issue . The headline story dealt with a reporter 's " expose " on the handsome second banana of a TV crime show ; the second banana had been suspended from high school twice ( twelve years ago ) and busted for possession of cocaine ( six years ago ) . Hot news for the haurfraus of America . There was alsop226an all-grain diet , a cute baby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been miraculously cured of cerebral palsy at Lourdes ( DOCTORS MYSTIFIED , the headline trumpeted gleefully ) . A story near the bottom of the page had been circled . MAINE " PSYCHIC " ADMITS HOAX , the headline read . The story was not by-lined . IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN THE POLICY of Inside View not only to bring you the fullest coverage of the psychics which the so-called " NationalPress " ignores , but to expose the tricksters and charlatans who have held back true acceptance of legitimate psychic phenomena for so long . One of these tricksters admitted his own hoax to an Inside View source recently . This so-called " psychic , " John Smith of Pownal , Maine , admitted to our source that " it was all a gimmick to pay back my hospitalbills . If there 's a book in it , I might come out with enough to pay off what I owe and retire for a couple of years in the bargain , " Smith grinned . " These days , people will believe anything  --  why should n't I get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which has always cautioned readers that there are two phony psychics for each real one , John Smith 's gravy train has just been derailed . And we reiterate our standing offer of $1000 to anyone who can prove that any nationally known psychic is a fraud . Hoaxers and charlatans , be warned ! Johnny read the article twice as the snow began to come down more heavily . A reluctant grin broke over his features . The ever-vigilant press apparently did n't enjoy being thrown off some bumpkin 's front porch , he thought . He tucked the tear sheet back into its envelope and stuffed it into his back pocket with the rest of the mail . " Dees , " he said aloud , " I hope you 're still black and blue . " His father was not so amused . Herb read the clipping and thenslammed it down on the kitchen table in disgust . " You ought to sue that son of a whore . That 's nothing but slander , Johnny . A deliberate hatchet job . "  | " Agreed and agreed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This afternoon'ssilently falling snow had developed into tonight 's early winter blizzard . The wind shrieked and howled around the eaves . The drivewayhad disappeared under a dunelike progression of drifts . " But there was no third party when we talked , and Dees damn well knows it . It 's his word against mine . " " He did n't even have the guts to put his own name to this lie , " Herb said . " Look at this an Inside View source . ' What 's this source ? Get him to name it , that 's what I say . " " Oh , you ca n't do that , " Johnny said , grinning . " That 's like walking up to the meanest street-fighter on the block with a KICK ME HARD sign taped to your crotch . Then they turn it into a holy war , page one and all . No thanks . As far as I 'm concerned , they did me a favor . I do n't want to make a career out of telling people where gramps hid his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Scarborough Downs . Or take this lottery . " One of the things that had most surprised Johnny on coming out of his coma was to discover that Maine and about a dozen other states had instituted a legal numbersgame . " In the last month I 've gotten sixteen letters from people who want me to tell them what the number 's going to be . It 's insane . Even if I could tell them , which I could n't , what good would it do them ? You ca n't pick your own number in the Maine lottery , you get what they give you . But still I get the letters . " " I do n't see what that has to do with this crappy article . " " If people think I 'm a phony , maybe they 'll leave me alone . " " Oh , " Herb said . " Yeah , I see what you mean . " He lit his pipe . " You 've never really been comfortable with it , have you ? " " No , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , either , which is something of a relief . It seems like the only thing other people do want to talk about . " And it was n't just that they wanted to talk ; that would n't have bothered him so much . But when he was in Slocum 's Store for a sixpack or a loaf of bread , the girl would try to take his money without touching his hand , and the frightened , skittish look in her eyes was unmistakable . His father 's friends would give him a little wave instead of a handshake . In October Herb had hired a local highp228school girl to come in once a week to do some dusting and vacuum the floors . After three weeks she had quit for no stated reason at all  --  probably someone at her high school had told her who she was cleaningfor . It seemed that for everyone who was anxious to be touched , to be informed , to be in contact with Johnny 's peculiar talent , there was another who regarded him as a kind of leper . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nurses staring at him the day he had told Eileen Magown that her house was on fire , staring at him like magpies on a telephone wire . He would think of the way the TV reporter had drawn back from him after the press conference 's unexpected conclusion , agreeing with everything he said but not wanting to be touched . Unhealthy either way . " No , we do n't talk about it , " Herb agreed . " It makes me think of your mother , I suppose . She was so sure you 'd been given the ... the whatever-it-is for some reason . Sometimes I wonder if she was n't right . " Johnny shrugged . " All I want is a normal life . I want to bury the whole damn thing . And if this little squib helps me do it , so much the better . " " But you still can do it , ca n't you ? " Herb asked . He was looking closely at his son . Johnny thought about a night not quite a week ago . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their strapped budget . They had gone to Cole 's Farm in Gray , probably the best restaurant in the area , a place that was always packed . The night had been cold , the dining room cheery and warm . Johnny had taken his father 's coat and his own into the cloakroom , and as he thumbed through the racked coats , looking for empty hangers , a whole series of clear impressions had cascaded through his mind . It was like that sometimes , and on anotheroccasion he could have handled every coat for twenty minutes and gotten nothing at all . Here was a lady 's coat with a fur collar . She was having an affair with one of her husband 's poker buddies , was scared sick about it , but did n't know how to close it off . A man 's denim jacket , sheepskin-lined . This guy was also worried  --  about his brother , who had been badly hurt on a construction project the weekp229before . A small boy 's parka  --  his grandmother in Durham had given him a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his father had n't let him bring it into the dining room with him . And another one , a plain , black topcoat , that had turned him cold with terror and robbed him of his appetite . The man who owned this coat was going mad . So far he had kept up appearances  --  not even his wife suspected  --  but his vision of the world was being slowly darkened by a series of increasingly paranoid fantasies . Touching that coat had been like touching a writhing coil of snakes . " Yes , I can still do it , " Johnny said briefly . " I wish to hell I could n't . " " You really mean that ? " Johnny thought of the plain , black topcoat . He had only picked at his meal , looking this way and that , trying to single the man out of the crowd , unable to do so . " Yes , " he said . " I mean it . " " Best forgotten then , " Herb said , and clapped his son on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed that it would be forgotten . Johnny drove north to attend a meeting at the high school for midyearteachers and to take a load of his personal things up to his new apartment , which he found small but liveable . He went in his father 's car , and as he was getting ready to leave I Icrb asked him , " You 're not nervous ? About driving ? " Johnny shook his head . Thoughts of the accident itself troubled him very little now . If something was going to happen to him , it would . And deep down he felt confident that lightning would not strike in the same place again  --  when he died , he did n't believe it would be in a car accident . In fact , the long trip was quiet and soothing , the meeting a little bit like Old Home Week . All of his old colleagues who were still teachingat CMHS dropped by to wish him the best . But he could n't help noticing how few of them actually shook hands with him , and hep230seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes . Driving home , he convinced himself it was probably imagination . And if not , well ... even that had its amusing side . If they had read their Inside View , they would know he was a hoax and nothing to worry about . The meeting over , there was nothing to do but go back to Pownal and wait for the Christmas holidays to come and go . The packages containing personal objects stopped coming , almost as if a switch had been thrown  --  the power of the press , Johnny told his father . They were replaced by a brief spate of angry  --  and mostly anonymous  --  letters and cards from people who seemed to feel personally cheated . " You ort to burn in H ! E ! L ! L ! for your slimey skeems to bilk this American Repubic , " a typical one read . It had been written on a crumpled sheet of Ramada Inn stationery and was postmarked York , Pennsylvania . " You are nothing but a Con Artist and a dirty rotten cheet . I bless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ort to be ashamed of yourself Sir . The Bible says an ordinery sinner will be cast into the Lake of F ! I ! R ! E ! and be consomed but a F ! A ! L ! S ! E P ! R ! O ! F ! I ! T shall burn forever and EVER ! Thats you a False Profit who sold your Immortal Soul for a few cheep bucks . So thats the end of my letter and I hope for your sake I never catch you out on the Streets of your Home Town . Signed , A FRIEND ( of God not you Si* " Over two dozen letters in this approximate vein came in during the course of about twenty days following the appearance of the Inside View story . Several enterprising souls expressed an interest in joining in with Johnny as partners . " I used to be a magician 's assistant , " one of these latter missives bragged , " and I could trick an old whore out of her g-string . If you 're planning a mentalist gig @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dried up , as had the earlier influx of boxes and packages . On a day in late November when he had checked the mailboxand found it empty for the third afternoon in a row , Johnny walked back to the house remembering that Andy Warhol had predictedthat a day would come when everyone in America would be famousfor fifteen minutes . Apparently his fifteen minutes had come and gone , and no one was any more pleased about it than he was . But as things turned out , it was n't over yet.  | " Smith ? " The telephone voice asked . " John Smith ? " " Yes . " It was n't a voice he knew , or a wrong number . That made it something of a puzzle since his father had had the phone unlisted about three months ago . This was December 17 , and their tree stood in the corner of the living room , its base firmly wedged into the old tree stand Herb had made when Johnny was just a kid . Outside it was snowing . " My name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He cleared his throat . " I 've got a ... well , I suppose you 'd say I 've got a proposal for you . " " How did you get this number ? " Bannerman cleared his throat again . " Well , I could have gotten it from the phone company , I suppose , it being police business . But actually I got it from a friend of yours . Doctor by the name of Weizak . " " Sam Weizak gave you my number ? " " That 's right . " Johnny sat down in the phone nook , utterly perplexed . Now the name Bannerman meant something to him . He had come across the name in a Sunday supplement article only recently . He was the sheriff of Castle County , which was considerably west of Pownal , in the Lakes region . Castle Rock was the county seat , about thirty miles from Norway and twenty from Bridgton . " Police business ? " he repeated . " Well , I guess you 'd say so , ayuh . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together for a cup of coffee . . . " " It involves Sam ? " " No . Dr. Weizak has nothing to do with it , " Bannerman said . " He gave me a call and mentioned your name . That was ... oh , a month ago , at least . To be frank , I thought he was nuts . But now we 're just about at our wits ' end . " " About what ? Mr.  --  Sherif  --  Bannerman , I do n't understand what you 're talking about . " " It 'd really be a lot better if we could get together for coffee , " Bannermansaid . " Maybe this evening ? There 's a place called Jon 's on thep232main drag in Bridgton . Sort of halfway between your town and mine . " " No , I 'm sorry , " Johnny said . " I 'd have to know what it was about . And how come Sam never called me ? " Bannerman sighed . " I guess you 're a man who does n't read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't true . He had read the papers compulsively since he had regained consciousness , trying to pick up on the things he had missed . And he had seen Bannerman 's name just recently . Sure . BecauseBannerman was on a pretty hot seat . He was the man in charge ofJohnny held the phone away from his ear and looked at it with suddenunderstanding . He looked at it the way a man might look at a snake he has just realized is poisonous . " Mr. Smith ? " It squawked tinnily . " Hello ? Mr. Smith ? " " I 'm here , " Johnny said , putting the phone back to his ear . He was conscious of a dull anger at Sam Weizak , Sam who had told him to keep his head down only this summer , and then had turned around and given this local-yokel sheriff an earful  --  behind Johnny 's back . " It 's that strangling business , is n't it ? " Bannerman hesitated a long time . Then he said , " Could we talk , Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The dull anger had ignited into sudden fury . Fury and something else . He was scared . " Mr. Smith , it 's important . Today ... " " No . I want to be left alone . Besides , do n't you read the goddam Inside View ? I 'm a fake anyway . " " Dr. Weizak said ... " " He had no business saying anything ! " Johnny shouted . He was shaking all over . " Good-bye ! " He slammed the phone into its cradle and got out of the phone nook quickly , as if that would prevent it from ringing again . He could feel a headache beginning in his temples . Dull drill-bits . Maybe I should call his mother out there in California , he thought . Tell her where her little sonny-buns is . Tell her to get in touch . Tit for tat . Instead he hunted in the address book in the phone-table drawer ,  |p233found  Sam 's office number in Bangor , and called it . As soon as it rang once on the other end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done that to him ? Goddammit , why ? He found himself looking at the Christmas tree . Same old decorations . They had dragged them down from the attic again and taken them out of their tissue-paper cradles again and hung them up again , just two evenings ago . It was a funny thing about Christmas decorations . There were n't many things that remained intactyear after year as a person grew up . Not many lines of continuity , not many physical objects that could easily serve both the states of childhood and adulthood . Your kid clothes were handed down or packed off to the Salvation Army ; your Donald Duck watch sprung its mainspring ; your Red Ryder cowboy boots wore out . The wallet you made in your first camp handicrafts class got replaced by a Lord Buxton , and you traded your red wagon and your bike for more adult toys  --  a car , a tennis racket , maybe one of those new TV hockey games . There were only a few things you could hang onto . A few books , maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that had been preserved and improved upon . Add to that the Christmas tree ornaments in your parents ' house . The same chipped angels year after year , and the same tinsel star on top ; the tough surviving platoon of what had once been an entire battalionof glass balls ( and we never forget the honored dead , he thought  --  this one died as a result of a baby 's clutching hand , this one dipped as dad was putting it on and crashed to the floor , the red one with the Star of Bethlehem painted on it was simply and mysteriously broken one year when we took them down from the attic , and I cried ) ; the tree stand itself . But sometimes , Johnny thought , absently massaging his temples , it seemed it would be better , more merciful , if you lost touch with even these last vestiges of childhood . You could never discover the books that had first turned you on in quite the same way . The lucky coin had not protected you from any of the ordinarywhips @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when you looked at the ornaments you remembered that there had once been a mother in the place to direct the tree-trimming operation , always ready and willing to piss you off by saying " a little higher " or " a littlep234lower " or " I think you 've got too much tinsel on that left side , dear . " You looked at the ornaments and remembered that just the two of you had been around to put them up this year , just the two of you because your mother went crazy and then she died , but the fragile Christmas tree ornaments were still here , still hanging around to decorateanother tree taken from the small back woodlot and did n't they say more people committed suicide around Christmas than at any other time of the year ? By God , it was no wonder . What a power God has given you , Johnny . Sure , that 's right , God 's a real prince . He knocked me through the windshield of a cab and I broke my legs and spent five years or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl I loved got married . She had the son who should have been mine by a lawyer who 's breaking his ass to get to Washington so he can help run the big electric train set . If I 'm on my feet for more than a couple of hours at a time it feels like somebodytook a long splinter and rammed it straight up my leg to my balls . God 's a real sport . He 's such a sport that he fixed up a funny comic-opera world where a bunch of glass Christmas tree globes could outlive you . Neat world , and a really first-class God in charge of it . He must have been on our side during Vietnam , because that 's the way he 's been running things ever since time began . He has a job for you , Johnny . Bailing some half-assed country cop out of a jam so he can get reelectednext year ? Do n't run from him , Johnny . Do n't hide away in a cave . He rubbed his temples . Outside , the wind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home from work . Johnny got up and pulled on a heavy sweatshirt . He went out into the shed , watching his breath frost the air ahead of him . To the left was a large pile of wood he had split in the autumn just past , all of it cut into neat stove lengths . Next to it was a box of kindling , and besidethat was a stack of old newspapers . He squatted down and began to thumb through them . His hands went numb quickly but he kept going , and eventually he came to the one he was looking for . The Sunday paper from three weeks ago . He took it into the house , slapped it down on the kitchen table , andp235began to root through it . He found the article he was looking for in the features section and sat down to reread it . The article was accompanied by several photos , one of them showingan old woman locking a door , another showing a police car cruisinga nearly deserted street , two others showing a couple of businesses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HUNT FOR THE CASTLE ROCK STRANGLER GOES ON AND ON . Five years ago , according to the story , a young woman named Alma Frechette who worked at a local restaurant had been raped and strangledon her way home from work . A joint investigation of the crime had been conducted by the state attorney general 's office and the CastleCounty sheriffs department . The result had been a total zero . A year later an elderly woman , also raped and strangled , had been discovered in her tiny third-floor apartment on Carbine Street in Castle Rock . A month later the killer had struck again ; this time the victim had been a bright young junior high school girl . There had been a more intensive investigation . The investigative facilitiesof the FBI had been utilized , all to no result . The following November Sheriff Carl M. Kelso , who had been the county 's chief law officer since approximately the days of the Civil War , had been voted out and George Bannerman had been voted in , largely on an aggressivecampaign to catch the " Castle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had not been apprehended , but no further murders occurred , either . Then , last January , the body of seventeen-year-oldCarol Dunbarger had been found by two small boys . The Dunbarger girl had been reported as a missing person by her part-tits . She had been in and out of trouble at Castle Rock High School where she had a record of chronic tardiness and truancy , she had been busted twice for shoplifting , and had run away once before , getting as far as Boston . Both Bannerman and the state police assumed she had been thumbing a ride  --  and the killer had picked her up . A midwinter thaw had uncovered her body near Strimmer 's Brook , where two small boys had found it . The state medical examiner said she had been dead shout two months . Then , this November 2 , there had been yet another murder . The vie tim was a well-liked Castle Rock grammar school teacher namedp236Etta Ringgold . She was a lifetime member of the local Methodist church , holder of an M.B.S. in elementary education , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the works of Robert Browning , and her body had been found stuffed into a culvert that ran beneathan unpaved secondary road . The uproar over the murder of Miss Ringgold had rumbled over all of northern New England . Comparisonsto Albert DeSalvo , the Boston Strangler , were made  --  comparisonsthat did nothing to pour oil on the troubled waters . William Loeb 's Union-Leader in not-so-distant Manchester , New Hampshire , had published a helpful editorial titled THE DO-NOTHING COPS IN OUR SISTER STATE . This Sunday supplement article , now nearly six weeks old and smelling pungently of shed and woodbox , quoted two local psychiatristswho had been perfectly happy to blue-sky the situation as long as their names were n't printed . One of them mentioned a particular sexual aberration  --  the urge to commit some violent act at the moment of orgasm . Nice , Johnny thought , grimacing . He strangled them to death as he came . His headache was getting worse all the time . The other shrink pointed out the fact that all five murders had been committed in late fall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't conform to any one set pattern , it was fairly commonfor such a person to have mood-swings closely paralleling the change of the seasons . He might have a " low " lasting from mid-April until about the end of August and then begin to climb , " peaking " at around the time of the murders . During the manic or " up " state , the person in question was apt to be highly sexed , active , daring , and optimistic . " He would be likely to believe the police unable to catch him , " the unnamed psychiatrist had finished . The article concluded by saying that , so far , the person in question had been right . Johnny put the paper down , glanced at the clock , and saw his father should be home almost anytime , unless the snow was holding him up . He took the old newspaper over to the wood stove and poked it into the firebox . Not my business . Goddam Sam Weizak anyway.  |p237Do  n't hide away in a cave , Johnny . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it at all . It just so happcnedthat he 'd had a fairly tough break . Losing a big chunk of your life , that qualified you for tough-break status , did n't it ? And all the self-pity you can guzzle ? " Fuck you , " he muttered to himself . He went to the window and looked out . Nothing to see but snow falling in heavy , wind-driven lines . He hoped dad was being careful , but he also hoped his father would show up soon and put an end to this useless rat-run of introspection . He went over to the telephone again and stood there , undecided . Self-pity or not , he had lost a goodish chunk of his life . His prime , if you wanted to put it that way . He had worked hard to get back . Did n't he deserve some ordinary privacy ? Did n't he have a right to what he had just been thinking of a few minutes ago  --  an ordinary life ? There is no such thing , my man . Maybe not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abnormal life . That thing at Cole 's Farm . Feeling peoples ' clothes and suddenly knowing their little dreads , small secrets , petty triumphs  --  that was abnormal . It was n't a talent , it was a curse . Suppose he did meet this sheriff ? There was no guarantee he could tell him a thing . And suppose he could ? Just suppose he could hand Iiirn his killer on a silver platter ? It would be the hospital press confercnreall over again , a three-ring circus raised to the grisly nth power . A little song began to run maddeningly through his aching head , little more than a jingle , really . A Sunday-school song from his early childhood : This little light of mine . . . I 'm gon na let it shine . . . this little light of mine ... I 'm gon na let it shine ... let it shine , shine , shine , let it shine .. . He picked up the phone and dialed Weizak 's office number . Safe enough now , after five . Weizak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ list their home phones . The phone rang six or seven times and Johnny was going to put it down when it was answeredand Sam himself said , " Hi ? Hello ? " " Sam ? "
