The first week in May . The jockey 's silks are as bright as a bridegroom 's cravat . We are rubbed to the patina of antique Georgian furniture . Thirteen of us . There is the soft smell of leather and light tweed , earth that a hundred years of horses have kicked up and a hundred years of juleps in silver stirrup cups have wet down . And rising , ever so faintly , above the crowd , over the salt tears that edge out of eyes when " My Old Kentucky Home " blares , a whiff of roses . ( I just gave you that bit of purple prose to dissociate myself from those other talking equi and mull , Mr. Ed and Francis . ) Anybody can run in it . At least if they 're registered by the Jockey Club . And there 's a story about a horse from out West who was asked not to , but whose owner insisted , until the nag was entered only to refuse to go into the starting gate , but once in with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go out , and finally out with the same aid , ran backwards . But " anybody " rarely wins it . Of the ninety-nine starts , forty-three post-time favor up his ears and gazes off nobly into the distance when he hears cameras clicking " ? what do they expect of you when they take a million pictures of you  --  one photographer even has a recording of mares in heat he plays to get our attention  --  but the grandstands seemed the place to lead . Ron Turcotte was no more than a fly or a gnat on my back when he struck me with his whip leaving the far turn . Then he switched it to his left hand . Flashed it . It seemed my lungs swelled , like water wings , lifting me into the ether  --  I never touched the ground again  --  the rest of the world seemed to have wound down to a snail race . I could hear the rows of men , see their arms high , know that it was me they were calling  --  almost to come back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go back . My heart was a boiler of blood . It seemed to me it might explode , but I could not stop . Then something outside of me took over and I was not merely me anymore . I was Pegasus , flat and lean , hurled against the sky . There was no resistance . The elements lay ites have won . It is the ninth race in a day of ten . Post time is 5:30 . And for the moment , Churchill Downs is the center of the universe . For racing ? No , not just for racing . For radiance . The horse that wins will wear , not just as long as his head is above the turf  --  but forever  --  a crown of glory . A brass name plate on his turn-out bridle . A plaque on his stall door . He will become a living moment in the big and noble hearts of Thoroughbreds . He will never be referred to again as a stakes horse , normally a compliment opposed to being called a " plater " ? one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case , she  --  will always be a Derby winner . The money is $125,000 to which are added nomination fees , entry fees ( $2,500 ) and starting fees ( $1,500 ) . The mutuel pool my year was $3,284,962 . The total bet , over $6 million ( a record ) . The value to the winner , $155,050 . Whichis n't bad for 1:59.4 . Which was a record for the track . Which , noted the Daily Racing Form , was fast . But nothing compared to me . I ran faster the last quarter than the first . Went by the stands last first . And first last . Which is when it counts . Elation . True elation . It is a rare experience . Mares have said when they 've dropped a foal and seen it , wet from birth , struggling to its feet -- awkward as a chapped-lip whistle  --  and seen that its points were those of a champion  --  straight and flawless legs , trim and tight knees and ankles  --  and that the colt would race and someday people would know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came to me  --  more I think at the Derby than at any other race . I did n't mean to be a ham , though Mrs. Tweedy says I am ? " He pricksdocile at my feet . Until I had passed ; then they shoved me . A pair of wings crossed the finish line . 1 was already in the winner 's circle and Mrs. Tweedy was leading me out to the roses . I could remember Sham , the horse I competed with who beat me in the Wood Memorial , and who came in second at the Derby , his mouth the color of roses too . Only it was blood . When we were being loaded into the starting gate , Twice a Prince  --  he ran next to last  --  perhaps he knew he was going to  --  refused to enter his stall . He reared up and threw his jockey . Shoes clanged against the metal of the stall divider . Sham 's head hit the gate , drawing blood , nearly knocking out his front teeth . Ron , smart as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and turned me away from the clatter . Somebody got Twice a Prince out of the gate and soothed him . They got his jockey back up and all of us were in our stalls and off . My hood is checkered  --  the colors of home  --  The Meadow  --  blue , white  --  it is like the flags at a Grand Prix  --  and on the backstretch I could see the blood flying from Sham 's mouth and right up to the wire I knew he was there , running fine , fast , rising over the pain and fear he felt . It would have been his race  --  any year but this one . Two who in any company would shine were this year against each other . Still , I could never have known myself against any but the best . Sham is the best . Races are never between the quick and the dead . They are between the quick and the quick . There 's another horse I have to name , too . My stable mate , Riva Ridge . Riva is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a shortness of grace and going ; he now stands at stud across the lane , a paddock away from me , at Claiborne Farm . I see him , silhouetted , motion even standing still , and there has been , at times , envy between us . When he won the Derby  --  the ninety-eighth running  --  he was the center of attraction . When I came along , there was trouble . People used to come see me in my stall , passing Riva Ridge . And he knew it and would turn his backside right up to the stall door , letting them have a taste of their own fickleness . Riva was the horse that first brought glory to The Meadow and made us all celebrities . Andoutside the stall is taken away ) , the way they  --  grooms , trainers , hands  --  try to make you relax , and how it never quite works . When they are nervous , you are nervous . " Horses ai n't like humans , " my friend and groom of last year , Eddie Sweat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Four-Legged One above for that . ) Eddie says , " They have a mind of their own and you never can tell what they 're going to do . You think you have them settled down , but something happens , and it might bother them . " Well , we 're hyperopic ( farsighted ) . And we ca n't see things close up unless our noses are practically touching them . Nor can we see direct . ly in front of us , but to either side , behind , and to some extent above and below . Stick your finger out in front of you . Now blink your left eye . Then your right . Fast . The finger seems to jump . Your eyes are an inch apart . Ours are six . Think how inanimate objects spring out at us . Then think that our ancestors knew running away was their only defense . Farsightedness shows us the enemy at a distance . Farsightedness creates time for head starts . So against this heritage  --  not to mention the Arabians bred with English mares @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ descended from three sires : the Byerly Turk , the Godolphin Barb and the Dailey Arabian  --  we are expected to perform in a world where people are our only friends , where stall walls are too high to January first . At a year we are considered to be seven . At three , we are one and twenty and our lives  --  in some stallions ' cases  --  are paved with woo . People say Ron Turcotte and I have our own style , that we break from the gate and then drop back ; that 's a nice thought . The competition is n't a bunch of drays , though , or the race an amateur version of The Iceman Cometh . They 're the fastest horses in the world and they 've been trained all their lives for this day . We have our own starting gate at The Meadow  --  and at Belmont , where I trained . So we 'll " when Christopher Chenery , who founded The Meadow and gave us all our chance and had always wanted to have a Derby winner , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we do n't know , but we think Mr. Chenery understood , sick as he was , that he had a winner , and he went out happy . Sometimes I think about the hardships of racing . About the cold morning workouts . About the other horses , the sting of the earth as it flies up and hits your belly , the closeness of the other horses , their fear and your fear , the tricks unscrupulous jockeys sometimes play on you , the animosity among trainers in the barns and stables at racetracks , the way we know we are going to be run ( instead of the usual four quarts of oats for lunch , there 's half a quart , and the hayenable us to get aquanted with any horses . Throughbred is a distinct breed of horse , just like Morgan , Hambletonian , Percheron or Hackney . We have a dished or straight profile , a long , slender neck , sloping shoulders , fairly short back . The width of brisket  --  the space between our forelegs  --  is large , making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powerful lungs . Our muscles are flat and stringy , mane and tail thin and fine , veins violin strings , skin so thin we suffer terribly from flies and hot weather . We are high-spirited , but rarely mean or stubborn ; ruined by rough treatment and easily gentled as a foal by kindness . Courage and quickness , spirit and delicacy mark us  --  no horse in the world can stay with us on the track ; none can outjump us in the field . And we all have the same birthday , know how to break . So we wo n't be afraid . Mrs. Tweedy thought of that and discussed it with Lucien Laurin , my trainer . ( I love it when people discuss around us , their voices are quiet and soft  --  they do n't want to upset us  --  vexation never won a race . ) Lucien said he thought it was a good idea . I like Penny Tweedy . She said the first time she saw me , " Wow ! " And it stuck . " The Wow Colt . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of like me . Well bred ( old Southern family  --  The Meadow belonged to her father 's people before the War between the States ) , well educated ( Smith , Columbia University  --  business administration ) , she knows what she 's doing , and she does what she knows , and pretty ( people cheer when they see her  --  and pretty is as pretty does so she got a public relations firm to handle the dishing out of me as a public figure ) , and , heaven forgive me , well fed . Most stallions do fairly well on twelve quarts of oats a day . I like sixteen . And I nibble hay while the sun shines , and after it goes down , I have a special supper . A sort of mash of oats fortified with vitamins and minerals plus carrots and " sweet feed " ? molasses-coated grain . Some horses wo n't eat after a big race . But it just works up my appetite . 1 hate to use the word tub , but bucket does n't really size it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " neat eater . " " He has a sip of water every now and then between his mash . Then he picks up any stray buds on the floor and varies everything with a few wisps of hay . But , lordy , the amount . " Well , consider my size . Twelve hundred pounds . Supported on legs less than yours . Like a bumblebee or a C-47 ( from an engineer 's point of view ) , I should n't be able to fly . And I 'm still growing . My girth is seventy-five and three-fourths inches  --  about an inch more than Man 0 ' War ( who was also called Big Red ) and I have to have a custom-made girth to hold my saddle . I can cover twenty-five feet in a single stride . You can see how that would eat up the Derby track , one and a quarter miles . Ron always says , " I like to let him find his feet . Then he gives me his speed when I chirp tohim . " Sometimes , the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he calls out with the crop . I do n't like it . 1 never have . I remember when he first used the whip . 1972 . It scared the fodder out of me . I ducked into another horse and our number was taken down for a foul . I had begun my career in racing at Aqueduct  --  Fourth of July  --  appropriate date for the " horse of the century " ? when another horse bumped into me at the gate and knocked me out of my direction . " If he had n't been such a strong horse , he 'd have gone down , " the jockey said . Still , I got myself together and finished fourth . Since that day I 've never been out of the money . Unbeaten  --  a good word in most sports  --  never really applies in racing . Man 0 ' War and Citation were beaten . I 've been beaten . But finished first in eleven out of fourteen races . How can we , after all  --  mute according to our masters  --  say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that we are under the weather or the weather is under us . At the Wood Memorial at Aqueduct in April , a few days before the Derby , I came in behind Angle Light and Sham . For the drama of the Derby , I suppose , I could n't have done better had I tried . Many sportswriters and racing experts said I 'd blown it . Of course the odds are the real sportswriters . And they remained $1.50 to $1.00 . Sham 's were $2.50 to $1.00 and Angle Light 's were the same as mine . Angle Light finishedtenth and Sham , of course , second . So from the gate we are fighting . Even when we drop back . Strategic withdrawal you could call it . But the more you spot the competition , the farther you 've got to go to catch up . Then you have to pass . And keep up . They said at the Derby when we swung around the outside , passing horses until only Sham was in front , we could never keep up such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I caught him  --  perhaps it was the sting of the whip- I feel I 'd have got him anyway  --  and beat him by two and one-half lengths for the fastest Derby ever . 1 often think green and white are the colors of the South . They know how to hang deep green blinds on spanking white walls , or how to plant a magnolia against a snowy column . That 's the look 1 get saddling up in the paddock . Thousands of tulips blooming just for us . The whole Derby is like a flying flag . Patriotic , colorful , wild in the bluegrass breeze . The moment the jockeys touch our backs  --  one of my friends said they look like squabs turned up in a Christmas pie with their little rumps  --  we start for the track where the outrider in a red jacket , usually on an Appaloosa , meets us and leads us out for the post parade and the warm-up . Like athletes  --  why say " like " athletes , we are athletes we have to warm up our muscles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it seems almost a far country . Even on Derby day when the inside of the track is filled with bodies  --  mostly young people with their shirts off for the warm May sun so that the track seems to be some giant public pool  --  quite a different sight from the boxes on the other side which cost $1,600 for the day  --  the noises hang in the air , a distant fantasy , a conglomeration of the great ocean liner Churchill Downs seems to be , its restaurants , its bars , its vast halls and betting windows , its milling throngs , closed circuit television , its wild people who never go outside to watch the races but sit , eternally glued to their racing forms  --  it would seem they would bet on themselves before they trusted in us to bring in their fortunes  --  all that seems a million miles away . On this side is still the barn . ( Churchill Downs has 1,200 stalls , 50 barns . ) And the warmth of the fresh hay , the cool spring water they give us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had before I came here . ( Ninety minutes I lay down for . Most horses are so nervous they paw through the floor . ) The outriders are urging their horses on , eyes  --  theirs , not ours  --  ours are fixed on the distance of around and back again  --  study jocks and mounts , looking , hoping for weaknesses , faults to be taken advantage of . The condition of the track , " That loam you have at Churchill Downs sticks to your face like cement when it flies up , " says one trainer : The brass of the post horn  --  a recording even on Derby day  --  becomes , with the shouts and urgings a welter in our ears ; the gate breaks and the last of life for which the first was made begins . Three camera towers grab us from three different angles , freezing us in our rage for honor . Motion picture film flies over the wire to a hot developing room ; is sent back to the stewards for viewing any infractions : horses bumping , crossing over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A clean race . There 's a party in the Director 's Room after Continued on page 136 the race . Champagne and very select company . Seventy-five invited guests . I heard Bob Gorham , one of the officers of the track , bemoaning having to turn down some senator . I 've heard them talk about that room , prints of Epsom , our Derby , now a print of me with Ron and Lucien , the six tufted black-leather chairs , scrolled , Victorian , deep , downy . The quiet butlers who fill your drinks before they 're empty . Of course , we have our own party . But we still had the Preakness and the Belmont to go . Now above the roses , I wear the Triple Crown , the first winner of it in twenty-five years . Perhaps the Belmont and the Preakness were more spectacular runs for me  --  thirty-one lengths beats the dead heat syndrome  --  but nothing ever seemed to capture the stopped-heart thrill of racing like the Derby . And even more than my being the Triple Crown winner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Kentucky where the land rolls gently , almost sensually  --  those people always say , " Turkey dinner , Derby winner . " And thank heaven I 'm protected . Fans would grab for souvenirs like I was a rock star . And , after all , I only have one suit . Sometimes , I think of racing days " as I watch the mares and colts frolicking across the meadows at Claiborne , the beautiful Hancock farm near Lexington , Kentucky , and the swans stretch their lovely necks on the meandering stream across the road from the white-columned house where the Hancocks have lived for so many years , and I wonder about the value placed on my blazed head . Six million dollars . Plus the money earned racing . Could anyone be worth that ? And calling me horse of the century . If another horse wins the Triple Crown next year , will he be the horse of the century ? That horse wo n't have the three white socks and blaze , wo n't be a public relations item , wo n't be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of millions of letters , and the donor  --  yesof charity on a colossal scale  --  no , I do n't just mean the taxes my owners have paid on my earnings . I mean the windfall to the state charities which benefit from betting . People were so thrilled , especially the two-dollar bettors , at having bet on me and at my winning , that hundreds of thousands of ticket holders did not cash in their tickets , preferring to hold them as souvenirs . " And that other horse wo n't be playful as a puppy , " says a stableman at Claiborne . " You just do n't think of a horse that strong , " says Mrs. Tweedy , " being that kind . " " Secretariat 'd never be mean , " says Lawrence Robinson , my best friend at Clai borne , and the man in charge of the breeding barn . There are other friends here too . " Snow , " a man whose face always seems to get into every picture with me . Pick up any magazine , and there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Buster Brown , " or some people call him " Charlie Brown , " a half cairn terrier , half mongrel , and four other halves . He slips into my paddock under the gate ? " He would n't dare go into any of the other stallions ' paddocks , " says Lawrence , and I have to chase the little mutt out . Then there 're the Hancock racing colors  --  bright orange and black  --  and they 're friends too , I know somehow the days of glory are n't really over , that a new crop of colts will be bounding across the meadow next year and that they will bear my blood and the blood of my sire , the great Bold Ruler whose stall is home for me now , and all the way hack to the immortal Eclipse , the immortal English sire of the eighteenth century . And I remember five hundred of the darkest , reddest roses ; small , tight buds , thorns stripped , draped over my withers . And I know of the pride of the woman who makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Never , " she says , " has a single rose fallen off before being put on the horse . " And I think that maybe one day , one of my sons will stand there and receive that same glory . And to tell the truth , I 'm a little jealous .
