txt Gov . William T. Cahill of New Jersey announced yesterday that the New York Giants had agreed to leave Yankee Stadium and had signed a 30-year lease to play football in a new stadium in the Hackensack Meadowlands in 1975 . The lease was signed by Wellington T. Mara , the president of the Giants , who said that " New York is not losing a team but gaining a sports complex . " He said the team would continue to play in Yankee Stadium until the end of the 1974 season under terms of its lease there . Essentially , Mr. Mara said he was moving his team to New Jersey to give the club the first real home it has ever had after 46 years in New York and to provide more convenient and A Setback for Mayor'l Is Seen in the Move to Meadowlands pleasurable surroundings to the tens of thousands of Giant football fans who have endured ; watching football in an aging ; stadium that was never meant ' for that sport . The announcement had been ; expected ever since the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a commit-I ment ' from Mr. Mara to move his club to a $200-million sports ; complex to be built on a 750- ; acre tract in East Rutherford . Nevertheless , the final news ; that the Giants were leaving generated considerable gloom in a city that has lost two major league baseball teams and a growing list of major corporations . The move constitutes a political victory for Governor Cahill and a setback for Mayor Lindsay , who tried hard to keep the Giants in Yankee Stadium . ' Governor Cahill told a crowded news conference at the ; Essex House on Central Park ; South that the move represented a " great day for the State of New Jersey and for the fans of the New York Giants . " The Governor said the switch " would provide the spark that will light up the entire Meadows , " which he called " the most valuable piece of real estate in the world . " In an apparent attempt to soften the blow reflected by angry statements from New York City officials , the Governor said that " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever have been , " The site is just north of Route 3 , seven miles from midtown Manhattan and a quarter of an hour by automobile from the Manhattan entrance to the Lincoln Tunnel . One of the first questions put to Mr. Mara at the news conference was whether the Giants would continue to be called the New York Giants even though they will play in New Jersey . He replied : " It was always the New York Giants and it alwa , , s will be the New York Giants . " Within an hour , however , Mayor Lindsay said he would go to court to prevent the team from retaining its New York identity . The Mayor also told a City Hall news conference that he would seek Congressional action to block the move . Mayor Lindsay also reaffirmed the city 's commitment to modernize Yankee Stadium , announcing that a proposed , new lease with the baseball Yankees would be offered to the City Council and the Board of Estimate within 30 days . However , City Controller Abraham D. Beame questioned the feasibility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sanford D. Garelik , the City Council President , said it did not make sense for the city to proceed with the purchase of Yankee Stadium now that it would have only one club playing there . At Stadium 15 Years As for the 15 years that his club has played Sunday afternoons in a stadium built for baseball , Mr. Mara compared himself and his team to a stepchild who never really fit in . Before moving to the stadium , the Giants played in the Polo Grounds . " Every family dreams of moving into its own house and to get away from its in-laws , " he said . Moreover , he said that the 75,000 ? seat stadium planned in New Jersey would offer Giant fans better seats than they now have at the 63,000-seat Yankee Stadium . Actually , the Giants signed a lease with the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority , a public agency created by the New Jersey Legislature last spring . The authority 's chairman , David A. ( Sonny ) Werblin , who played a leading role in molding the New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a proposed $200-million sports complex that would include as its basic ingredient a large race track for thoroughbreds . The complex also would include a proposed . separate baseball stadium , hockey and baseketball facilities , a large hotel and a number of other commercial developments . Governor Cahill said that the over-all project would be the " catalyst " for the future development of a 20,000-acre tract that comprises most of the undeveloped land in the Meadowlands , which is controlled by the Hackensack Meadowland Development Commission . While the Giants will provide the publicity and the glamour to put the project across , the race track will generate the money to get it going . Thus , the legislation creating the sports authority stipulated that if the Giants refused to move to New Jersey , the entire project would be nullified . The Governor said he would ask the Legislature to authorize a race track for the site . He said he fully expected favorable action and that such authorization would permit the authority to issue revenueraising bonds that would pay for the construction of the track and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goal would be to operate nearly year-round thoroughbred racing . Such an action would constitute a financial threat to Aqueduct in Queens and Belmont Park on Long Island , as well as eat into the revenue at Monmouth Park in Monmouth County . Several suits that challenge the legality of the sports authority have been combined into one major court test that is expected to be resolved by early next year . According to a fact sheet released by Mr. Cahill , the Giants will pay an annual rental equal to 15 per cent of ticket sales . The lease calls for an equal split on all concessions , a minimum of 25,000 parking spaces for cars and 400 spaces for buses . Earlier studies for a domed facility were abandoned at the insistence of Mr. Mara , who contended that the part of the fun of watching football was to sit huddled outside in freezing temperatures . Mr. Cahill said that the state would undertake a series of highway improvements aimed at making the complex more ' accessible . Exclusive bus lanes will be reserved on highways leading from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also that rapidtransit facilities were being considered , with the possibility that PATH trains now operating out of Manhattan could be connected directly to the site . A new exit from the western spur of the New Jersey Turnpike is expected to provide direct access to the site , and extensive widening is now in progress along Route 3 , an east-west highway , and along Route 17 , a major north-south road through Bergen County . According to the Governor , the projected travel time along existing facilities would be as follows : 33 to 40 minutes from the Tappan Zee Bridge , 16 to 18 minutes from downtown Newark , 11 to 14 minutes from the Port Authority . Bus Terminal in Manhattan , 15 to 19 minutes from the George Washington Bridge and 28 to 33 minutes from the Verrazano Bridge . signed in behalf of the authority . It was Mr. Werblin who originally gave the Giants trouble when he challenged the club 's 46-year , supremacy over New York professional football . Yesterday . Mr. Mara and Mr. Werblin smiled at each other as Mr. Cahill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time when Wellington Mara and I were competitors across one river , " Mr. Werblin said , " but now we are partners on the same side of another .
