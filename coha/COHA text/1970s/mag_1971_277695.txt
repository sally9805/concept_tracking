Last year an intensive drive by citizen groups concerned about ecology and national priorities nearly doomed continued development of the U.S. supersonic transport aircraft . After the Senate voted nay , the plane was temporarily saved by a House-Senate compromise extending funds through March of this year . With that mandate about to expire , the battle has been joined once more . This time the SST 's supporters have mounted a highly professional counterattack that threatens to overwhelm the aircraft 's critics . <P> The four-week , $150,000 pro-SST blitzkrieg is mainly the work of an ad hoc National Committee for an American SST , supported by the aerospace industry and some 30 labor unions . It has placed full-page ads in leading newspapers . One pictures a boy holding a model of the SST and asks : " Will SSTs really pollute his world ? " The answer , claims the ad , is that one SST moving at 1,780 m.p.h. " will emit no more pollutants per mile than three compact automobiles traveling at 60 m.p.h . " As for sonic boom , the craft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ad contends , the boom effect on the ocean surface will be " comparable to the impact of a fisherman 's spinning lure hitting the water . " <P> Other ads appeal to nationalistic sentiment . One shows a Soviet SST and is headlined : " Announcing international SST service-the best that rubles could buy . " The real question for Congress , the ads contend , is " Will America be left on the ground ? " The Russians have inadvertently aided that argument by-running two-page ads in Aviation Week &; Space Technology , a U.S. magazine , urging aerospace executives to buy the Soviet TU-144 SST . They also announced that their plane will go into regular passenger service in October . <P> Serious Students . The SST advocates are directly pressuring Congress as well . AFL-CIO President George Meany told a Senate Appropriations Subcommittee that the entire future of the American aerospace industry , already " in a state of economic shock , " was at stake . He claimed that the SST could generate 50,000 aerospace jobs and another 150,000 in related industries . The U.S. is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generation of SSTs , Meany argued , and it must hurry to " enter the competition for the second generation - the SSTs of the 1980s and 1990s . " <P> The comparable subcommittee in the House was addressed by David Fradin , 20 , an aeronautical engineering student at the University of Michigan , who heads a national group of technically oriented students who back the plane . " We are the serious students , the ones who go to class when others seek to shut down the school , " Fradin said . " We will not give up our dreams of peace , clean environment and social progress brought about with the aid of aerospace . " <P> Boycott Cheese . The SST supporters have deluged Congress and potential backers elsewhere with a mail blitz of 400,000 pieces of literature . In smooth prose , they seek to rebut each criticism of the plane and to stress its economic benefits . One broadside claims that " one SST sold overseas will offset the import of 20,000 Volkswagens or 200,000 Japanese TV sets . "      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
