Jamming a chaw of Beech-Nut tobacco into his cheek , Larry Csonka jumped into a blue Chevrolet pickup truck and , with his older brother Joe at the wheel , bounced down a deeply rutted , brown dirt road to get a close look at 80 acres of Ohio potato and corn fields up for rent . " It 's real good land , " Joe said as they surveyed the rolling countryside in the fresh fall air . " It 's got good drainage and you can see the good crop growing here . " Larry nodded . " We can use the land , " he said . " Let 's take it . " Before climbing back into the truck , he kneeled down and poked at the loamy soil , picking up a 3-to-4-lb. potato that had been missed by the pickers . <P> Digging into eastern Ohio dirt was not exactly what professional football 's best fullback expected to be doing this fall . He was set for his first season with the Memphis Grizzlies of the World Football League , a team @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Running Back Jim Kiick and <P> Wide Receiver Paul Warfield . The bait that lured the 6-ft. 3-in. , 240-lb . Csonka from the established National Football League and his $60,000 contract : a $500,000 cash bonus and $325,000 a year for three years in bank-guaranteed - salary . His job was just as big : to help give the new league star-studded credibility . <P> Cinderella Industry . Instead of leading the wobbly W.F.L. to prosperity , though , Larry Csonka had watched the starveling league die midway through its second season . Along with more than 350 other players , he had become a victim of the ' 70s retrenchment in sport . After a roaring decade of unprecedented growth , professional sport in some ways looks like a Cinderella industry heading toward midnight . Of the 23 teams in the American Basketball Association and World Hockey Association , only one is in the black . " There 's no question about it , " says Attorney Bob Woolf , who has negotiated hundreds of contracts , " the pendulum is swinging back .

" When my kids register for school here , " he told TIME 's Jay Rosenstein , " their father 's occupation will be listed either as ' unemployed ' or ' who knows ? ' " <P> Unlike most of the other W.F.L. players sidelined by the league 's sudden death , Csonka at first had hopes that he might actually profit from it . Encouraged by his agent Ed Keating , Csonka thought for two days that he would be available for open bidding by N.F.L. teams . " I believe lightning has struck twice , " said Keating as he arrived in Memphis the day the W.F.L. folded . " Larry is free to negotiate a deal with the Dolphins or another N.F.L. club and still draw his guaranteed salary from <P> Memphis . " No way , announced Grizzlie Owner John Bassett .
