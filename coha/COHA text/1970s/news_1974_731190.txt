txt Tim INCIDENT seemed ' out of place at the time , 22-year-old Denise Bandera redalls , and perhaps that is why she remembers it well . It was Oct. 30 , 1972 , and Miss Bandera was one of the victims of that morning 's Illinois Central Gulf Railroad crash in Which 45 persons were killed and 360 injured . Miss Bandera had been rushed to the University of Illinois Hospital with both legs broken and physicians feared for a time that one of them Would have to be amputated . Then it happened : " I ' was n't even out of surgery when some joker was there with a lawyer 's mime far me. " she recalled recently . " He ! the lawyer is a well-known politician , Vrdolyak . We thought the timing was rather poor , to say the least . " She was referring to Ald. Edward R. Vrdolyak 110th 1 , and in the days and weeks that followed , other victims and didr relatives received the same grim sales pitch , they reported . . In some cases , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ precinct captains ; Md . Edward Vrdolyak says Tribune reports that he solicited law clients from among victims of the ? 1972 Illinois Central Gulf commuter train crash are dishonest and biased and he vows to fight charges . Story on page 7 . Soho serve Vrdolyak in his dual positions as alderman and ward committee ' man . At other . times , the efforts of his precinct captains were bolstered by those of a Chicago policeman and ? an I. C. adjuster , according to witnesses . And in at least two cases , according to persons interviewed by Tribune reporters and investigators for the Better Government Association , Vrdolyak himself appeared with promises of generous financial settlements . VRDOLYAK , who is running for county assessor in the March 19 Democratic primary , has built a lucrative law practice on personal injury cases . The victims of the I. C. crash and their relatives and survivors were solicited at home and at work as well as in hospitals . To the public , this tactic is , known as " ambulance chasing . " The practice is prohibited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Illinois Code of Professional Responsibility . The " ambulance chasing " label was vigorously denied by Vrdolyak , his precinct captains , and everyone else alleged to have " mentioned " the alderman 's name in connection with personal injury cases . " I get a lot of my business from people saying , ' Ed is a god lawyer . Personal injury work h his specialty . Go to him , " Vrdo ? lyak said in an interview . " I even get cases from policemen and firemen ? oil duty of course ? but do n't tell anyone to do it . I handle business from wherever it comes . " THE INTERVIEW wag conducted last week in one of Vrdolyak 's law offices , at 1925 E. 95th St. The other is at 7 S. Dearborn St. Vrdolyak insisted that a press agent , his office manager , and Robert Seltzner , editor and columnist for the Daily Calumet , a Southeast Side community newspaper be present . Vrdolyak described Seltzner as a " very good friend and adviser . " ? Vrdolyak denied ever persondlly soliciting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ residents . The I.C. officials were unaware of any Vrdolyak tactics in attempting to round up clients , railroad attorneys said . Vrdolyak 's 25 cases in connection with the crash are far more than any other attorney has . " Within a couple of days of the wreck , he called and asked us how we wanted him to file the attorney 's liens on his cases ? by packets of fives , tens , or by the dozen , " one I.C. official recalled . " I guess he was really geared up . " Liens are documents filed to insure that attorneys get their percentage of settlement payments . ONE PERSON who was willing to talk was Williams , 66 , a Circuit C o u r t clerk , whose wife , Alberta , was killed in the crash . Williams decided not to hire Vrdolyak . Williams said Vrdolyak personally solicited his case in a meeting behind the 14th floor Civic Center courtroom to which Williams was assigned . Williams said he was approached after he had turned down a $55,000 settlement offer made by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're talking about that kind of money , " Williams quoted Frost as saying , " you better get Ed Vrdolyak as your attorney . " Shortly after that , Williams said , Vrdolyak came to his courtroom and asked him to step into a back office , where Williams claims , Vrdolyak gave him the following sales pitch : . " I came by to see you about your case . I have three or four of these death cases , ' and I already settled them for $100,000 each . I can get $100,000 for your case ? $25,000 Or me and $75,000 for you . " Williams said he was surprised by the approach , but told the alderman he would discuss the matter with his family . " A little while later , Frost called back and told . me again that I should take Vrdolyak . " Williams said Frost 's interest in Vrdolyak 's getting the case made him doubt the alderman would represent his best interests . " So when someone who identified himself as Vrdolyak called and asked , ' What about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lawyer . " ? FROST , A CLAIMS adjuster regularly assigned to ' the railroad 's South Chicago branch , which includes Vrdolyak 's 10th Ward , denied recommending Vrdolyak to any crash victims . " I know him because he is an attorney on some of the cases I have handled , but I have no personal relationship with him , " Frost said . Vrdolyak denied ever making the first contact with Williams . Instead , an attorney employed by Vrdolyak said Williams approached him inquiring about the possibility of being represented by the alderman . Attorney Alan C. Mendelson said he took Williams ' name and telephone number a n d Vrdolyak then called the clerk . " I saw Williams a while later in his courtroom and he told I me he did n't like what Vrdolyak told him , " Mendelson said . " Ho said ho wanted whatever lawyer that represented him to guarantee he 'd get $100,000 for the case . He told me Vrdolyak would n't guarantee him $100,000 . " VRDOLYAK ? DENIED ever guaranteeing crash victims certain settlements and said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I only deal with the boss , " Vrdolyak said , " the chief claims adjuster . " Mrs. Leslie Curnow , 10505 Av . N , another 10th Ward resident , said a ' Democratic captain from a neighboring precinct came to her home the week of the accident while her daughter Cathy , 19 , was still in the hospital with a broken leg , " His name was Centracchio , " she recalled . " He said all the other lawyers want to charge a fee but Ed Vrdolyak will do it for nothing . " " My daughter was n't even home from the hospital yet , " she said . " Can you imagine saying he would do it for free ? They 'll say anything they have to . " Cesar Centracchio , captain of the 39th Precinct , at first denied soliciting cases for Vrdolyak and then later conceded that he recommended Vrdolyak to crash victims . DURING an interview in Piotrowski Playground , where he works as a $740-a-month Chicago Park District laborer , Centracchio said : " Well , I just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subject came up . I 'd tell them about Eddie because Eddie is a friend and an attorney . " Centracchio , whose wife , Lorraine , was injured in the wreck , later admitted visiting the homes of accident victims , but said it was part of his duties as a captain to canvass the precinct . MRS . EMILY GASS identified 10th Ward Democratic precinct ' captain Jack Farrell as the man who came to her home at 9530 S. Muskegon Av. the evening of the accident . ? Her daughter Joyce , 26 , was hospitalized with knee and back injuries , and the family was in no mood for discussing attorneys at the time . " Then he said to be very careful who you do go to for an attorney , " Mrs. Gass recalled Farteli as saying . " You should n't go to outsiders . You should go to the aldermanVrdolyak . " Farrell , an ? ironworker and captain of the 55th Precinct in the 10th Ward , refused to answer questions . VIIDOLYAK SAID that any of his 61 precinct captains who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " If there is a fire or an accident or a death in a family , the precinct captains are always the first ones at the home to offer help , " Vrdolyak said , - " If they said that ? people ought to hire Eddie , then they did it on their own volition . " But the family of Marlene Mallek , 22 , another crash victim , said Vrdolyak himself visited their home at ' 8628 S. Kingston Av. to ask permission to see their daughter in Billings Hospital . " He said he was going to represent her and he ' would like to see how she was doing , " recalled Miss Mallek 's father . The father also noted that It was the first information he had received that his daughter was represented by an attorney . Miss Mallek later recalled in an interview that she had not yet decided on an attorney when Vrdolyak went to her home . Vrdolyak 's request of the family followed a visit to her hospital room by Chicago Policeman Edward A. Dziubbarczyk , a friend of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after the accident , " Miss Mallek recalled . " He said , ' If you need a good personal injury attorney , you should contact Edward Vrdolyak . He 's a good personal injury attorney . ' " Vrdolyak went to the hospital several days later and inquired about ' her condition , she said . Miss Mallek said Dziubarczyk visited her several times a week during her hospital stay and repeatedly recommended that she hire Vrdolyak . " I finally decided that would be the thing to do , " she said . Dziubarczyk , then assigned to the Maxwell area traffic division , at . first denied recommending Vrdolyak . He later conceded that " I probably mentioned his name , " during visits with several friends hospitalized by the crash . However , the policeman , who is now assigned to the radar unit , said he never would have " recommended " an attorney . " I was a traffic area investigator for five years , " he said . " I would know better than to do that . "      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
