The Soviets exploded their first atomic bomb , China fell to the Communists , and the House Un-American Activities Committee was trumpeting after subversives . The year was 1949 and the Red Scare was spreading when Alger Hiss went on trial . The confrontation between Hiss and Whittaker Chambers , his accuser , was to become a haunting symbol of the era 's fears and suspicions . Conservatives tended to trust Chambers ' claims that Hiss had passed secrets to the Soviets ; many liberals believed that the poised State Department official with the splendid record of service had been wrongfully and villainously attacked . <P> In this week 's Nation section , TIME re-examines the verdict of guilty reached against Hiss nearly three decades ago . The occasion : the coming publication of Perjury : The Hiss-Chambers Case , a book by Historian Allen Weinstein that skillfully and diligently re-creates the struggle between the two contrasting men and brings revealing new insights and documentation to the case . <P> Appropriately , the reporter who interviewed Weinstein for this week 's story was Senior Correspondent James Bell , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had spent all of 1948 on the campaign trail with Harold Stassen , Harry Truman , Earl Warren and Tom Dewey , " recalls Bell . " I was the only member of the Washington bureau who was totally ignorant of the case , and I felt none of the emotion that appeared to grip my colleagues who had covered the Hiss story on Capitol Hill . It was precisely for that reason that I was picked to report the trial . " For TIME and Bell , the story posed special problems : Chambers had been a writer and senior editor at TIME ( editing back-of-the-book sections and foreign news ) from 1939 to 1948 , when he resigned . Chief of Correspondents Robert Elson told Bell : " We do n't want you to take Chambers ' side or the other . Just give it to us fully , accurately and as soon as you can each evening . " During the next eight months , Bell sat in on every session of the two perjury trials , scribbling notes so furiously that he developed a set of calluses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He often turned out 4,000 words an evening , five days a week . <P> Editor in Chief Henry R. Luce deemed Bell 's work so fair and thorough that he donated a bound set of the files to Yale University 's Law School Library , where Weinstein later studied them for his book . <P> Though Bell maintained his evenhandedness in his files , he remembers : " I became convinced during the cross-examination of Hiss in the second trial that he had committed perjury . He quibbled incessantly on irrelevant matters and skimmed quickly over what was relevant - that , plus the typewriter , the documents and the expert analyses . My perceptions have n't changed over the years ; they were reinforced by Weinstein ' s book . "
