Price of Caring <P> To the Editors : <P> Your story " Medical Costs-Seeking the Cure " May 28 almost scared me sick . The best solution for keeping medical costs within reason is to stay well . <P> Mark Insalata Ossining , N. Y. <P> I do not fear the rising costs of health care as much as I fear yet another multi-billion-dollar Government program . It will only advance us closer to a socialist U.S. and mean more inflation for the middle class , who must support this " something-for-everyone " program . <P> Sheri Hendricks Zion , III . <P> I was expecting yet another attack on America 's latest whipping boy , the medical profession . Instead , I was pleased to find a clear , concise and unbiased account of an emotionally charged issue . <P> John Allen King , M.D. Gainesville , Fla . <P> Americans as a whole have done little to preserve their health , and most do not deserve medical care at reasonable cost . Advertising of cigarettes and any unhealthful products should be banned , and the money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Ala . <P> Before the plug is pulled on this dialysis patient , be sure someone is around to answer the question of whether society can afford not to have me around just because my kidneys do n't work . <P> Kathy R. Patterson Oxon Hill , Md . <P> You are to be congratulated for focusing on the subject of the rapidly rising cost of health care . But we were disappointed that you failed to mention a Republican health insurance bill , the Dole-Danforth-Domenici proposal . <P> Our catastrophic health insurance proposal has three key parts . First , those eligible for Medicare will be protected by expansion of their present benefits . Second , the large majority of the employed will be assured of the availability of adequate private insurance protection . Third , those who are part of the residual marketplace , and not already covered , may choose to have the Federal Government serve , in some instances , as a financial backup , in contracting with the private insurance companies for catastrophic coverage . <P> Bob Dole , Jack Danforth , Pete Domenici U.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plan would provide coverage for all Americans and aim at limiting costs , an admirable scheme . But along with any plan to ration medical care and limit its cost comes a compromise in quality . Will the Senator tell us this ? <P> Andrew Jamieson Fargo , N. Dak . <P> As a medical student , I found myself agreeing with the Boston specialist about the physician 's right to charge high fees . It 's disheartening to realize that while the public apparently demands perfection in technique and diagnosis , it pays for it rather grudgingly . <P> Terry J. Gioe Indianapolis <P> The argument that doctors have a right to charge high fees because of the " long years of learning and not earning , the killing hours and loss of contact with family , " etc. , is rubbish . At no time during premed , medical school , internship or residency did someone put a gun to my head and force me to continue . <P> Leon Reinstein , M.D. Baltimore <P> We all should listen to the modern Hippocratic statement made by Alan Alda-a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> George Eddy Parker Cornwall-on-Hudson , N.
