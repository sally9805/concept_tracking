txt The Air Force has begun a " full-scale investigation " into allegations that cadets at the Air Force Academy here have been operating a theft and forgery ring since 1972 . In response to questions from The New York Times , the academy acknowledged that in the spring of 1975 two cadets were charged with thefts and forgeries involving 11 fellow cadet victims . One of the accused was dismissed after a court-martial . The other resigned . Documents in the case indicate that the ring stole checkbooks , identification cards and deposit slips from fellow cadets and used the items to cash forged checks , sometimes at the bank that is on academy grounds . The entire student body , or " cadet wing , " at the academy was " briefed " about the cases other cadet , who resigned in July 1975 . In a letter dated Aug. 23 to General Allen , the private ' attorney , Edward Joel Meyer of Middletown , N.Y. , offered to provide details showing that a " ring " of forgers that got under way in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for several years . Mr. Meyers said the ring could be going on right now . He also said his evidence indicated that " other cadets had knowledge of the ring 's operation " and might have profited from the money the ring had stolen . Mr. Meyer provided transcripts of interviews he conducted in July with two unnamed men who admitted they had been forgers at the academy and described how their schemes worked . General Allen wrote back immediately , describing the charges as " serious " and requesting any further information , including the names of the two men interviewed . In a telephone interview , Mr. Meyer said his own research indicated at least 25 cadets had been cheated by the ring and that thousands of dollars were involved . He developed his material while representing a cadet who last fall was accused of being a forger . Through Mr. Meyer 's efforts , the cadet was fully exonerated of the charges and was reinstated at the academy . Stole Cards , Checks Mr. Meyer 's letter and transcripts suggest that the honor code itself made trusting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steal their military identification cards , wallets , checkbooks , deposit slips and money . " It was very easy , " a man identified as a self-confessed forger and referred to only as " Mr. Y " in the transcript was quoted as saying . " Cadets leave checkbooks and a lot of personal items and stuff in front of the cadet store . All cadets ? usually kept their wallets and checkbooks in the top drawer of their desk , or they 'd keep their wallets sitting in their back pocket of their uniform pants . " " Mr. Y " continued , " It was a very simple matter to go into the cadet 's room at night because the door was not locked . Usually they were asleep . Usually two of us would go , one to go in the room itself and one to stand outside the room in case anybody would come along . " Mr. Meyer 's letter noted that checks are the major means of paying for things at the academy . Many cadets have accounts in the Air Academy Nationa Bank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his letter , Mr. Meyer said the forgeries had begun simply . A cadet would steal another card and his checkbook . Then he would substitute his own // at the time and strict new cadet security measures were put into effect . However , Lieut . Gen. James R. Allen , the academy 's superintendent , ordered a new , broader inquiry last Friday ' ! after a private attorney wrote , , him citing evidence that an academy forgery ring involving at least four cadets might still ibe active . The inquiry , which is being conducted by the Air Force ! Office of Special Investigations , comes at a time when the honor code at all three major United States service academies is being re-examined after a cheating scandal at West Point . lThe honor code , as stated by the Air Force Academy , ! says : " We will not lie , steal I dr cheat , nor tolerate among lus anyone who does . " An Air Force spokesman said Thomas C. Reed , the Secretary of the Air Force , had been kept " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aware of the new one . 3 Years Involved According to the academy , the two cadets accused in 1975 had allegedly carried their thefts and forgeries from 1972 through March 1975 . In the case of the cadet who was court-martialed , a total of $542.92 was involved . " Subsequently , there have been a few isolated complaints of forgeries but not evidence of any connected series , " the academy said , adding that the most recent complaint came last January . The academy said the 1975 investigation " did not reveal any evidence that would lead to charges against other cadets for conspiring in these cases . " The court-martialed ' cadet was identified as Robert C Stewart , a third classman ( sophomore ) , who left the academy in July 1975 and whose official dismissal took effect in May 1976 . The academy would not release the name of the photo on the victim 's identification card , practice the victim 's signature and finally cash the innocent man 's checks in downtown Colorado Springs restaurants and stores , as well as at the Air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mr. Meyer charged that one forger did this throughout 1972 and 1973 " without ever being questioned by Air Force authorities . " Mr. Meyer said this man had been graduated by the Academy . In 1974 , Mr. Meyer 's letter said , the forgers got more sophisticated . Their headquarters were in a cadet 's room . They systematically raided dorms and others spots where , cadet belongings were left unattended . To escape detection , the letter continued , the forgers would often operate as follows : First , they would steal a check from Cadet A and an identification card from Cadet B. Then , a thief would write a check from Cadet A payable to Cadet B. Using Cadet B 's stolen identification , another forger would then cash the ' , check . In another scheme , a forger , would deposit part of the check into a third , innocent cadet 's account , taking the remainder in cash . Both schemes made it difficult to trace the check to the actual thief . Instead , it looked as though one , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were on accounts at the Air Academy National Bank and because the thieves appeared in uniform to cash them , the letter said , the forgers never had a problem getting their money . Accused Called a Victim Mr. Meyer said in his letter that it was obvious his client had been one of the victims of the " ring . " However , he said it was " upsetting " that " not one of the members of this forgery and theft ring has ever spent a day in jail . " Mr. Meyer declined to say whether Mr. Stewart was one of the two men interviewed in the transcripts . " Mr. Y " was quoted as saying that the forgers concentrated on cheating fellow cadets whose checkbooks showed balances of close to $1,000 or more . Mr. Meyer , in the telephone interview , said his information indicated forged checks were written for sums between $10 and several hundred dollars . At the start of their academy careers , cadets are instructed to open a checking account if they do not already have one . Most of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Colorado Springs . Their military pay , which each cadet receives while a student at the academy , is usually deposited automatically in their local Colorado bank accounts .
