There is a human time bomb ticking away in Hollywood . He is called Bruce Dern . One of these days he is going to light up the sky . How , nobody knows . At 39 , with a suitcase of rave clippings , Dern is poised to become a star . Trouble is , he has been in that position for a couple of years , ever since he scored a personal hit as the bellicose Tom Buchanan in The Great Gatsby . But the brass ring has never seemed to get any nearer . His friend Jack Nicholson comforted him by declaring publicly that Dern is his only real rival . Even Alfred Hitchcock is compassionate . Dern recently wound up his role as the ne'er-do-well anti-hero in the master 's Family Plot . Hitchcock promised : " You 're going to be the first actor I 've ever made into a star . " <P> Bruce sure hopes so . " I need only one hit and I 'm home free , " he reasons . This year should be his . He has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He can be seen currently as Big Bob Freedlander , the Jaycee mobile-home salesman in Smile , a comedy manqu about a teen-age beauty contest . Next month , he starts work on Won Ton Ton , a farce about the 1920 's legendary wonder dog , Rin Tin Tin , in which he plays an old-line Hollywood director . But keeping busy is not the only answer . Says Agent Freddie Fields : " Bruce needs to make love to a woman on the screen . " In his 19-year career , Bruce has only kissed a woman once . She was Karen Black in Gatsby . " And then the script had me break her nose - very romantic , " says Dern . Other stars , like Gene Hackman , lack sex appeal , but Hackman makes up for it by displaying an appealing self-doubt . <P> Dern is different-so macho that the only things in his face that move are his eyes , navy blue and sparkling , and even they do not blink . His icy authority has lifted his more than 100 character portraits in TV @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the fascinating . Whether Dern played a mad doctor in Two-Headed Transplant , a hillbilly husband in They Shoot Horses , Do n't They ? , a bi-sexual boy friend in Bloody Mama , he projected an anomie that was almost aggressive . Onscreen , he draws attention to himself in a curiously negative way , as if he were a marked man . Who else , for example , would allow himself to be cast as the only actor ever to kill John Wayne onscreen ? In 1971 , while Dern was still stuck in second-rank roles , he signed on in The Cowboys as Wayne 's assassin . " Dern , " said the Duke kindly , " you 're gon na be hated everywhere in the world for this one . "
