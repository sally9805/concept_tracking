A wave of Soviet tanks and armored personnel carriers rolls across the northern German plain . Unable to stem the tide , NATO generals request permission to use tactical nuclear weapons . According to an alliance agreement , the President of the U.S. must give his assent before battlefield nukes can be fired . He does . Scores of heavy artillery pieces are aimed at the invaders . Nuclear devices , each packing the equivalent of ten kilotons ( 10,000 tons ) worth of TNT , halt the aggressors . But in the process , West Germany 's cities and factories are leveled , and civilian casualties run into the millions . An American military spokesman , paraphrasing another from the Viet Nam War era , explains , " We had to destroy Germany in order to save it . " <P> At his press conference last week . <P> President Jimmy Carter flashed a yellow light-proceed with caution-for the funding of a weapon that most U.S. military strategists consider necessary to avoid such a scenario . The neutron bomb , * they argue , would enable NATO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the process , as would be the case if existing tactical nukes were used . <P> The neutron bomb would be delivered by Lance missiles to battlefield targets as far distant as 75 miles , or by 8-in. artillery shells to objectives up to 20 miles away . It gets its name from the fact that on detonation , unusually large quantities of radioactive neutrons are released , which are effective in killing people without destroying buildings or vehicles . They can , for example , penetrate enemy armor at considerable ranges , though such armor can be made resistant to the blast and heat of a regular nuclear explosion , except in direct or near-direct hits . " Large yield " nuclear weapons , on the other hand , are designed to enhance heat and blast-the major killing factors in the atomic bombs dropped on Japan . <P> The neutron bomb that is slated for production packs a one-kiloton punch . By contrast , most of the tactical nukes that are stockpiled in Europe come in sizes often , 20 and 50 kilotons . If a standard ten-kiloton warhead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a radius of over a mile . A neutron bomb exploded 130 yds. in the air would destroy all structures within only a 140-yd. radius . It would instantly kill anyone within a half-mile radius , and for people within a one-mile range would cause delayed deaths up to a month after the blast ( see chart ) . But because of its low-yield blast and heat effect , it would spare all buildings beyond a 140-yd. radius of ground zero . Moreover , the radiation dissipates quickly , and would not affect an area beyond a radius of 1% miles . More than other nukes , the bomb is thus very much a precision weapon , designed for battlefields of limited size .
