txt THE CHICAGO OFFICE of the Federal Bureau of Investigation admitted in a letter disclosed Monday that it provided the key information leading to the 1969 Black Panther raid . The FBI 's imavement in the raid is admitted in a memorandum sent to J. Edgar Hoover , late director of the FBI , a few days after the Dec. ? 9 , 1969 , raid in which Panthers Fred Hampton and Mark Clark were killed by police gunfire . The letter , prepared by FBI Agent . Robert T. Piper and approved by Marlin W. Johnson , former head of the Chicago FBI office , said " the raid was based on information furnished " by William M. O'Neal Jr . O'Neal was an FBI informant in 1969 who had infiltrated the Illinois Black Panther Party and sometimes acted as bodyguard for Hampton , who headed the Illinois Panthers .

Monroe St. Testimony in the four-month-old Panther trial before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obtained information on weapons in the Panther apartment , it gave the information to Chicago police and then to the state 's attorney 's office . The plaintiffs contend the FBI " shopped around " for local authorities to conduct the raid so they could continue to conceal the FBI 's counter-intelligence program against the Panthers . According to Piper 's memo , O'Neal gave the FBI information about the apartment 's floor plan and the weapons . His memo said this information " was not available from any other source " and that it " proved to be of tremendous value in that it subsequently saved injury and possible death to police officers participating in the raid . " The Piper memo , which heretofore has remained under FBI cover , was disclosed in- a motion ' filed in Federal District Court Monday ' in connection with the $47.7 million Panther raid civil suit . THAT SUIT seeks civil damages from 28 corrent and former law enforcement officers .

" The motion charges the FBI and government attorneys have withheld quantities of FBI documents they were told to turn over to the plaintiffs , which include the families of Hampton and Clark . One of the documents they recently turned over was the Piper memo , the motion said . THE MEMO by Piper , one of the 28 defendants , asks Hoover to approve a $300 bonus for O'Neal . In apparent support of his plea for the bonus , Piper goes on to say in the memo that " during the resistance by the Black Panther Party members at the time of the raid , the chairman of the Illinois chapter , Fred Hampton , was killed and a BPP leader from Peoria ( Clark was also killed . " The motion filed Monday also . refers to another FBI memo on O'Neal . That memo , written in 1969 by FBI . Agent Roy Martin Mitchell , says O'Neal was " worth much more than he was paid , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also states that other secret FBI , memos say Mitchell personally posted $1,000 bond in 1969 for the release of O'Neal on charges of conspiracy to kidnap , and that Mitchell also put up $1,600 to pay for O'Neal 's car . Piper and Mitchell , who also is one of the defendants in the civil suit , were O'Neal.
