txt Whenever a Federal agency issues a major decision or regulation that is subject to court review , there is , quite literally , a race to the courthouse . Lawyers for industry , unions and consumer groups , plus squadrons of paralegal aides , deploy themselves in the courts of their choice to file an appeal before their opponents file in the courts of their choice . It is a spectacle that ought to make judges blush . The law provides for review in whichever court an appeal is " first instituted " by any " aggrieved party . " There are 11 Federal circuit courts across the country , several of which have acquired reputations that certain lawyers find especially appealing . The Fourth Circuit , with judges from Virginia , West Virginia and the Carolinas , for instance , is favored by industry lawyers in labor and job-safety cases . The Fifth Circuit , based in New Orleans , is popular with attorneys for oil and gas producers . Labor and consumer groups tend to seek out the District of Columbia Circuit . The race @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deploys sentinels at the Government agency involved , poised to signal some colleagues at court the moment the agency clerk declares an action has been formally filed . If a competitor has tied up the available telephone lines ? an old newspaper trick ? the contestants resort to walkie-talkies . Court clerks time-stamp the appeals , knowing that as their first judicial act the judges are going to have to declare a winner of the race . The record in narrow winning times was two seconds until a dead heat occurred two years ago . Naturally , the contestants must start the race without pausing to see which side was actually " aggrieved " by the agency decision ; they leave that problem for learned counsel to argue later . Some lawyers consider the exercise professionally demeaning , but the hope and profit of a favorable decision usually conquer qualms . One might think the courts themselves would be embarrassed by what the lawyers are telling them : that verdicts turn on the identity of the judges as much as on the force of law . But the judiciary has done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , has now proposed a change in appellate law . It would provide a referee , an existing group of respected Federal judges called the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation , to designate which circuit court should hear an appeal . But in trying to clarify the standards to be applied , the proposal seems less than evenhanded . It would place the appeal in the region " in which a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to the proceedings occurred , or a substantial part of the property that is the subject of the action is located . " Apparently this means that oil and gas appeals would be heard in the vicinity of the producer 's fields or the employer 's plants , giving a home court advantage to industry in many cases . That advantage is real , of course , only if certain courts are in fact more disposed to lean one way rather than another . But if they are n't , what 's all the running about ? We are glad the Justice Department has recognized the problem and urge it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
