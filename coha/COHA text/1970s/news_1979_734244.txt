txt The Supreme Court ruled today that a bribery prosecution of a member of Congress could not include any evidence that refers to the Congressman 's past support of bills in exchange for money . ? The 6-to-2 decision , in a prosecution of Henry Helstoski , a former New Jersey Democratic Representative , was a setback for the Justice Department , which had argued that such an expansive reading of the Constitution 's grant of Congressional immunity would result in " making bribery prosecutions of Congressmen nearly impossible . " Delay in the Trial one tioverrunent lawyer called the decision a " serious blow . " He said that the United States might have to drop the charges against Mr. Helstoski because under the ruling critical evidence is now barred from the trial . Mr. Helstoski was indicted three years ago , charged with soliciting and accepting bribes in return for introducing private immigration bills . These bills al- // lowed aliens to gain permanent resident status in the United States ; the filing of such a bill automatically suspends deportation proceedings against the alien . Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delayed until the immunity questions are resolved . Among the evidence barred by the decison , according to the Government 's brief , is testimony that Mr. Helstoski or his former administrative aide received money after the private bills were introduced and that they " demanded payment , and sometimes accompanied their demands with explicit declarations that the payment was sought in exchange for private bills already introduced , " " Without doubt the exclusion of such evidence will make prosecutions more difficult , " Chief Justice Warren E. Burger wrote for the majority today . However , he said , " reference to past legislative acts of a member can not be admitted without undermining the values protected " by the Constitution 's speech or debate clause . The clause provides that " for any speech or idebate in either house " members of Congress " shall not be questioned in any other place . " Earlier cases interpreting the clause had made clear that bills themselves could not be introduced as evidence in a prosecution of a member . But the Government argued in this case , ( U.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it sought to introduce consisted not of " legislative acts " themselves but of conversations " occurring wholly outside Congress " that simply referred to ? and would make sense to a jury only in the context of ? legislative acts . The Government had lost this argument both in the trial court and in the United States Court of Anneals for the Third Circuit . Views of the Justices Four other Justices ? Byron R. White , Thurgood Marshall , Harry A. Blackmun and William H. Rehnquist ? subscribed fully to Chief Justice Burger 's opinion . A sixth Justice , William J. Brennan Jr. , said he " would go much further and order the dismissal of Helstoski 's indictment altogether . " The Government view was supported by Associate Justices John Paul Stevens and Potter Stewart . Associate Justice Lewis F. Powell Jr. , who missed the argument because of illness , did not participate in the decision . The dissenters wrote : " The mere fact that legislative acts are mentioned does not require that otherwise relevant and admissible evidence be excluded . " Evi dence that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " so long as the jury is instructed that it should not consider the references as proof of legislative acts , and so long as no inquiry is made with respect to the motivations for such acts . " The Court has before it another case involving the speech or debate clause , in this case a libel suit against Senator William Proxmire by a recipient of one of the Wisconsin Democrat 's " golden fleece " awards . Today 's majority may have forecast the outcome of that case when it observed in a footnote : " The clause is also a shield for libel . " A decision in the Proxmire case is expected in the next two weeks . i Six years ago , in a Federal bribery prosecution against Senator Daniel B. Brewster of Maryland , the Supreme Court rejected the argument that the speech or debate clause precluded even an indictment of a member of Congress for such an offense . But the Court did not have occasion to rule on the kind of evidence the Government could use . Senator Brewster eventually pleaded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so the evidentiary issues that were at the heart of today 's case never reached the Court .
