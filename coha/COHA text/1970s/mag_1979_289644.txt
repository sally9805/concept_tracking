Protests at home and a price revolt in OPEC as Saudi power wanes In Concord , N.H , it took the form of an automobile " honkin " outside Jimmy Carter 's re-election campaign office . In Nashville , a 500-lb. pig with BIG OIL painted on its side was led to city hall to munch slops from a dish labeled AMERICAN WEALTH . In Washington D.C. , elderly citizens bused in to join a picket line outside the American Petroleum Institute . <P> In more than 100 cities and towns in 35 states last week , hundreds , and in some cases thousands , of demonstrators joined in the biggest protest ever against what the country is targeting as " Big Oil . " They voiced fears of a winter of low temperatures and high fuel costs , passed out " Big Oil Discredit Cards " and waved banners declaring , " I do n't want to freeze in the dark . " For most , the principal peeve was not gasoline prices or petroleum industry profits but the 60% rise in the cost of heating oil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not , the Big Oil protest , which was sponsored by a number of diverse labor and political groups came at an odd time . As it happened the most visible oil price gougers last week were not the oil companies but some of the more militant price hawks in the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries . Iraq , Libya and Iran all announced boosts of 10% or more in the overall cost of their crude , and other producers seem likely to follow suit . What really alarmed oil consumers was that the Libyan and Iranian rise , like that announced by Mexico a week before but unlike those announced by Iraq or earlier by Kuwait broke through the $23.50 per bbl. price the cartel set in June as a " ceiling " for at least six months . <P> This early piercing of the OPEC lid came despite an attempt by Saudi Arabia the largest oil producer , to keep the lid on ' Last July , Saudi officials announced that they would raise their daily oil production during the remainder of 1979 from 8 5 million to 9.5 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increase would have prevented unilateral price hikes . No longer . The rules of the oil game have changed . <P> The essential problem , as the Saudi Minister Sheik Ahmed Zaki Yamani admitted during a visit to Washington last week , is that OPEC has " lost control " of price levels . It is now up to the oil-consuming nations to limit price increases by curbing demand . Yamani 's point is well taken . The only reason that Libya and Iran have been able to lift prices so much so soon is that , despite an international agreement earlier this year to curb imports , demand for oil continues to grow at a time when Iran 's internal problems and lack of technical expertise threaten supply cuts at any moment . In the first eight months of this year , oil imports by Japan , Italy , West Germany and France increased by between 5% and 13.2% . <P> Though U.S. consumption has fallen somewhat , the country 's imports have also nsen , though only by 1%.           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
