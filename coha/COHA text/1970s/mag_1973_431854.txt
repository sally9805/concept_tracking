 | Getting in a Lair with a Bear Bears appeal to a side of us that is lumbering , churlish and individual . We are touched by their anatomy because it resembles ours , by their piggishness and sleepiness , by their very aversion to everything about us except our garbage . Where big tracts of forest remain , black bears still do fairly well . They have a simple vegetarian diet , supplemented by insects , fish and carrion , and the grizzly 's prickly ego is absent in them ; they are secretive woodland animals that stay under cover and do not expect to have everything go their way . What they do need , though , is space ? from two to five square miles just to gather their food , and units of at least 50 square miles of wilderness for their wanderings and social relations . In this day and age such a chunk must be land that has other uses . Loggers are going to be cutting on parts of it , boy scouts will be holding encampments , canoeists will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . But black bears , like coyotes , seem willing to coexist . They give promise of being . with us for a long while . They are coated for living on windy ridges or down in swamps and hollows , and even snowmobiles ca n't get to them during the winter because they are under the snow . Probably the most ardent investigator of black bears today is Lynn Rogers , a 33-year-old graduate student at the University of Minnesota who for four years has been climbing into and out of occupied dens in the pursuit of data . He works in Isabella , Minn. ( once called Hurry Up , until a leading citizen renamed it after his daughter ) , a logging town near the Canadian border . The logging is fading now as aspen grows in place of the old stands of white pine , but the place is bursting with bears . On a seven-mile stretch of highway near Rogers ' headquarters 30 were shot one year . But that was before the townspeople became interested in his work ; now they let the bears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the woods whatever is lummoxy drops away . He moves quickly , running a dozen errands at once , searching for plants whose leaves will match the unknown leaves he has been finding in bears ' scats , examining a nearby rubbing tree for hairs left on the bark since his last check . If he is lost in his jeep in a tangle of old logging roads , Rogers gets a radio fix on the closest collared bear and figures out where he is . If he is near one of them and wants a glimpse , he lifts a handful of duff from the ground and lets it stream lightly down , to test the wind before beginning his stalk . He may find a bear hunting frogs , or watch one surprise a wolf and pounce at it . Then suddenly he will climb an oak tree to taste the acorns on top , spurting up the branchless trunk without any spikes , his hands on one side pulling against his feet on the other . Lost in the yellow fall colors , munching bear food , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ job this is , huh ? " Where wolves , for example , have fabulous legs to carry them many miles between kills , bears solve the riddle of survival by denning . This does away with the harsher months of the year . Although a bear 's breathing slows by one-half and its metabolism subsides enough that it loses only about 5% of its weight a month ( half the rate at which the bear would lose weight during ordinary sleep ) , its continued 33  | temperature does not fall much below normal while it is in the den . This distinguishes bears from true hibernators like bats and woodchucks and means that they can give birth in the security of the den and that a bear can defend itself in at least a rudimentary way if attacked . Its sense of danger is reduced ? the carefully surreptitious visits Rogers makes to dens go off with a minimum of fuss ? but there , in its easily defended hole , it could deal even with a pack of wolves . Males sleep alone but a female has the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three . They are born in the winter and den with her again the following winter : then , when they are slightly more than a year old , the family breaks up . The female breeds again , but by the device of delayed implantation of the ova her new cubs are not born till midwinter , giving her a respite . The cubs are remarkably tiny when they arrive , weighing just over half a pound apiece , or half what an infant porcupine weighs . Their eyes will not open for 40 days , but , since they are so small , the cubs are n't much of a drain on their fasting mother when suckling . Like baby apes , they have a long period ahead of intimate maternal association , an intimacy that will help make them far more intelligent than most mammals . Bears scrape out a depression for themselves under a pile of logs , a rock ledge or a fallen tree , usually pulling in a layer of dead grass and leaves for insulation ( paying a high price in heat and weight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in fine shape when they emerge in mid-April ; with their winter fur they appear to be fat . But they rapidly thin in those first weeks as they tramp about trying to find something to eat . In Minnesota they break a path to the nearest aspen stand , climbing and riding down the young trees to bite off the catkins at the tips of the limbs . They sniff out rotten logs under the snow and bash them apart , devouring the insects that have been hibernating there . A mother will take her cubs to a tall tree , such as a pine , and install them on a mound of warm earth at its base , which she scrapes on the south side , nursing them , sending them scurrying up the tree whenever she goes off to search for food . Then , when the spring grass sprouts , the family begins to thrive . The coating of fat that bears wear much of the year is of indirect use to them . If they are shot , it blocks the flow of blood , making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too , leave less of a track than the sharp feet of other game . They are good survivors and , if they do n't insulate their dens or choose a sensible location for themselves , they probably will come through the winter all right anyway : the snow , melting from the heat of their bodies , then freezes into an igloo around them , complete with a breathing hole . If the complicated physiology by which they are supposed to fatten at an accelerated rate in the fall does n't accomplish this ( sometimes a mother gives so much milk that she stays thin ) , they muddle through nevertheless , just as orphaned cubs do if they must winter alone without denning instruction . The only dead bear that Rogers has ever found in a den was a 19-year-old female which at that extremely advanced age had given birth to two cubs ; the babies had milk in their stomachs but appeared to have been killed during her death throes . In the past four years Rogers visited 106 dens , first observing the bears ' autumn rituals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an advantage over biologists studying other wildlife just because bears do den . He can go right to any bear wearing a functioning radio and , after tranquilizing it , attach new batteries , good with any luck till the following winter . Rogers can equip the yearlings with radios before they leave their mothers ; and the habit of denning makes bears of any age easier to trap . Rogers ' traps consist of two 55-gallon barrels welded together and baited with meat , and the bears , far from finding the contraptions claustrophobic , crawl comfortably in . Occasionally , when an animal is too bulky for the barrel trap ? as happened last summer when Rogers was trying to recapture a 455-pounder ? he sets foot snares . Wildlife biology used to be hit or miss . Rogers ' predecessors in the science would hog-tie a trapped bear once in a while and clap an ether cone on it , then proceed to take weights and measurements .

Every state 's game department insisted on going over much the same ground with these prankish experiments to maintain its sovereignty . In the late 1950s tranquilizers began to be employed , and radio collars a few years later . Now even turtles and fish are saddled with transmitting equipment and there is talk of substituting a microphone for the beep signal in the case of certain outspoken creatures like wolves , and recording their histories vocally . Some experts do n't use such tools suspecting that the hallucinogen in the tranquilizer , the obtrusive handling of the animal while it is immobilized and having to wear a bulky collar may alter . its personality and fate . But Rogers is a believer . He says that bears get used to the radio collars within two days and they are large enough animals to carry sufficient batteries to keep the radio ) working for a long period . In Minnesota Rogers has captured 183 different bears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the summer ) ; earlier , in Michigan , he assisted in catching about 125 . Flying 400 hours in 1972 , as much as his budget allowed , he made over 3000 aerial fixes on his bears . Of the 37 he put radios on in the winter of 1971-he could still monitor 18 on a daily basis in late September , locating some the others whenever he wished to pas his pilot extra for a longer search . To place all this in perspective , the state of New Hampshire , for instance . until recently had only one bear trap . converted highway culvert that was trundled out three or four times a year . The game wardens got so excited when was used that two of them would sleet overnight in a station wagon parked close by so as to be there when the door clanged . Before Rogers ' program began . the most sophisticated set of figures or territoriality for black bears in the United States had been drawn from the state of Washington , where 17 bears had been studied . At Rogers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , friends recognizing his tags and collars . Everybody in the area keeps an eye out the window for bears crossing fields .

In his blue wool - cap , with wrinkles ound his eyes because of the polar weather he 's seen , shambling and blunuering and abstracted , he is a touching figure , a big Viking first mate proud of the fact that he can heft a 240-pound bear alone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pocket full of his luncheon sand- , iches , the other with hay-scented packets of scats he forgot to remove after yesterday 's trip ( they smell pleasant enough , and he likes carrying them as boys like carrying snakes ) . One typical morning last fall a call informed Rogers that some grouse hunters had illegally pumped enough bird shot into a bear caught in one of his foot snares at a dump to kill it , so he went to autopsy it . He recognized it as the mother of two cubs that apparently had run away . The bear 's feet were cut from stepping on broken glass and one of its ears had been half torn off years before . While Rogers was working , the hunters who had shot the animal showed up , hoping to claim the skin . They were rough-looking customers , and the witnesses to the killing , who were also grouse hunters , were afraid to identify the culprits until after the men had left , which they naturally did just as soon as they heard Rogers talking about getting the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to enlighten Rogers ( after they had tied the gutted bear to their car ) , he could hardly believe that men could be so chickenhearted . He bawled them out , threatened to take the bear back , went home and telephoned all the game wardens around . That day Rogers drove to several other dumps . gazing up at the white gulls and black ravens wheeling above , perhaps a rather desolate sight to most people , with the papers strewn around and the beer cans glinting , but not to him ; he imitated how his bears weave their long heads looking up at the birds . He told all kinds of stories ? cheery stories , wretched stories . Somebody in Isabella had gutshot a bear with a .22 , and the @# creature took five months to die , finally going from den to den in the middle of winter , in far too much pain to be able to sleep . It died in the open snow , having shrunk to 90 pounds . The next day when one of the newly orphaned cubs was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tag and weigh it . Many questions remain about how orphaned cubs fit into the pecking order of the area with no mother to lay out and defend a territory for them . All summer Rogers had been in radio contact with the offspring of a bear a poacher had killed in June when the cubs were not long out of their mother 's den . In a slow , haphazard fashion , presumably scuttling up trees when a wolf or another bear appeared , they found their way around , doing quite well for themselves until a Duluth , Missabe and Iron Range train killed them . They had begun by eating their mother ? perhaps could not have survived otherwise , since they were unweaned . One may imagine them at first simply scratching at her udder in order to reach the milk that was curdling inside . For as much as six hours a day Rogers jounces about in the jeep on logging trails . Then he goes up with his pilot for another four hours , the plane standing on one wing most of the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bear project is funded by several disparate organizations , including the Big Game Club , the National Rifle Association and the American Forest Institute , and cautious pilots cost the project money . They wo n't circle tightly and low , but Rogers has found a young man who is paying for his plane with bearstudy money and is daring enough . The biologist , wearing a headset and homing in according to the relative strength of the beeps in each earphone , directs the pilot by hand signals . Sometimes the beeps sound like radar chirps and sometimes like the pop-pop-pop of a fishtank aerator . The earphones work even better on the ground ; as he listens , Rogers can distinguish not only the bear 's movements across humpy terrain but its restlessness during a thunderstorm , its activity when it tears apart logs for ants and when it is den-building . On his best day he livetrapped seven bears , and once in the winter he handled five bears in one den ? four yearlings and their mother . Like many outdoorsmen , Rogers was sickly as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roughhouse and was kept indoors ? the teacher would give him a chance to tell the rest of the class what birds he had recognized out the window while they had been playing . When he was feeling better , he and a friend used to jump from tree to tree or swing on long ropes like Tarzan , until Rogers took a bad fall and was hospitalized . The boys swam during the summers , plunging into deep ponds and kicking their way underwater along the runways in the mud looking for snapping turtles , whose meat they sold in Grand Rapids for a dollar a pound . They would never leave off exploring a pond where the fishermen told them there was a monster fish until they had determined whether it was a great six-foot pike ? he still laughs remembering the times when it turned out to be only a large carp . When he had grown up and was working as a postman , Rogers went through one Michigan winter without wearing an overcoat to see if he could tough it out . For some reason he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about him , following him for hours on his rounds . In the afternoon he sometimes carried the littlest ones back to their homes in his pouch . Another day Rogers began by flying for several hours , locating almost all of his bears that wore functioning radios , and then on the ground , as a check of his methods , went to three of these fixes and confirmed visually that the bears were indeed where he 'd marked them . He shot a grouse for supper and drove to Finland , a town south of Isabella , to check on bear No. 320 , a female he had already located more than 200 times for his studies of territoriality . The bear goes to the town every fall to eat the acorns ? the only such acorns around ? remaining till the snow is thick before hurrying 20 miles back home to dig her den . " What a job this is ! " Rogers said again , pointing out balm of Gilead , climbing an oak , identifying birds , and halting by the side I of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do a sweep with his antenna and earphones in case another bear was near . He spoke of the animals ' diet . Some weight tests were amazing . One of his bears grew from 89 to 255 pounds in a year ; another gained 95 pounds in 42 days , ending up at 380 , and still crawled continued 37  | into a barrel trap , getting so stuck R , ers had to stand the barrels on end a lift them off to free the poor fatty. spite all the good food available , a the fact that his bears face little hu ing , Rogers finds the average age of t population is only about 4I/2 ? just just ab the same as biologists calculate for much more severely hunted places like mont , where almost a quarter of t bears are shot every fall . Bears do n't ture sexually until they are four , whit . combined with the circumstance that t females breed only every other year , give them one of the lowest reproductive rat of any animal . Now that his research @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point where bea that he handled as infants , then watches play king-of-the-mountain on their mothers ' backs , are themselves giving birth . From his plane in the fall Rogers photographs the terrain in color , delineating the zones of vegetation , which he ca , map and compare with his radio-marked bear ranges for the same area . This indicates not only the habitat and food that bears prefer , it shows which logging practices of the past benefited them and which did not . He charts what the . eat in each 10-day period of the year , drawing on the evidence of scats , his walks and sightings from the air . No bears scavenge at dumps so much that they cease depending upon wild foods . but many visit dumps intermittently , either as a sort of lark or when the wild staples fail . In the early summer their die : is salady ? vetch , clover grass and peavine . They also dig out grubs and burrowing hornets , clean up wolf kills , ea : dandelions , strawberries ( the first of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hips , haw apples . wild plums , hazelnuts and dwarf dogwood . Raspberries , although abundant . are not eaten in the quantities one might imagine , maybe because they grow singly on the cane , but bears do feast on blueberries in midsummer , pausing only for a week or two to give closer attention to the berries of the wild sarsaparilla plant . In Michigan and New England the bears stay aboveground into November . eating nuts in the hardwood forests and apples in derelict orchards . But in Rogers ' wilderness the last crop eaten is the fruit of the mountain ash ? red berrylike clusters . By October most of the bears @#  | have picked their dens and are puttering around , sleeping more and more , letting their bodies wind down , though a few large males journey to the shore of Lake Superior , where there are resorts with sizable dumps , and eat till the snow covers their food , not until then making tracks back . When a bear finally stops eating and its intestines are empty , a seal forms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When he is trying to enlist somebody 's support or is testing applicants who want to help him , Rogers generally goes to one of his dens . The student gets down on his hands and knees and looks into the troll-like crevice where mushrooms grow on the floor . Whether or not there is still the smell of a bear inside , there seems to be , and it reminds one of humble hideouts that a boy might run away to ? and digging to China , and bottomless cracks in the earth . Whenever he gets near bears in the flesh , Rogers comes into his own ? decisive , direct . Where other biologists explode the tranquilizer into the animals with a dart gun , leaving a wound , perhaps knocking them out of a tree so that they are killed , he does almost all his injecting by hand . The sows stand chuffing at him , slamming their paws on the ground to scare him , but he runs at them , stamping his feet , and stampedes both sow and cubs into separate trees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their round rear ends before lowering them one by one by a rope as the drug takes effect . Approaching a bear denned under the snow , he slips off his parka so that it will not squeak as he crawls . Wriggling forward , he carries a flashlight in one hand and the syringe in the other , often fastened to the end of a stick . If the bear is awake and panics and begins coming out , Rogers rolls quietly to one side of the entrance and crouches there , poking the bear with the drug as it lumbers past ; it ca n't get far . Sometimes the bears make a blowing sound like a man loudly cooling soup , a warning that Rogers takes to heart only if it is accompanied by a lifted upper lip ? this being a true giveaway of belligerence . " It 's like driving in town . You 've got a traffic light to tell you to stop . " But usually the bears stay becalmed , rest ; ng in their nests , merely sniffing the syringe when it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than to an insect 's bite . Rogers ' worst problems are with the weather . There are days when he has to break trail on snowshoes for his snowmobile , sometimes for miles . Often he must put the needles and vial of drugs in his mouth to warm them . The tubes of blood he collects are placed inside his shirt . For his blood-tapping and temperature-taking he must drag the bear out , and if there are cubs he deals with t ; em , sometimes squeezing into the fart ' test recesses of the den but finding them unresisting once the mother has been subdued . Newborns have blue eyes and pink noses . He listens to their hearts , measures their fur and then wraps them in his parka until he is finished working on the mother . He pulls a premolar from her , which , when cross-sectioned , will supply her age , and he also takes a blood sample . The bears are all right in the cold , even knocked out , though in the summer they sometimes need to be bathed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rogers finishes , he replaces the family just as it was , wrig-@# gling inside the den , hauling the cubs and the mother in after him , adjusting her posture and limbs so that she will wake up feeling natural . In late September Rogers checks denning places . This is while the ground still fairly clear of snow ? he memorizes how to find a spot later by lining up by trees . No. 414 's den last winter under a clump of boulders , 15 feet through a passage from the entrance No. 320 's was under a bulldozed pile birch the loggers had left . A few n away a female was preparing a small basket-shaped hideout under the roots of white pine , from which , like a hum i portly child , she sneaked , circling do , . wind to identify the intruder before ch. ing out . A male was hollowing sleeps quarters under a crosshatch of windf just above a swamp . In a peavine clearing Rogers phot graphed three bears eating and obtai some scats . He tasted bear delicacies he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tasted rock tripe a pointed to moose and wolf tracks . 1 one of his traps was a young bear , chopping its teeth and clicking its tongue . Rogers answered with the same sounds , , and when he let the bear loose rt bounded toward the woods like the beast of a children 's fairy tale . with a big rolling derriere , a big tongue for eating , and pounding feet , its body jackknifing into the shape of a boomerang . The dogwood was turning purple now , the aspens golden , the plum bushes red , the pin cherries brown , and the birches and hazel and thimbleberries yellow . There was pearly everlasting , and blue large-leafed aster still blooming in the woods , and sweet fern Rogers plucked and crushed in his hands to smell . Alders had grow n higher than the jeep on some of the roads . " Does n't have too much traffic , " he said . He seemed very impressive , this student of wild food and smells . this scholar of garbage dumps .
