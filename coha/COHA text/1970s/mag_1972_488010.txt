The kind of novel known as " Southern " is identifiable even from a distance , at a glance , by at least one colorful marking : it , focuses on the family , a subject that offers ready-made a situation in which people live with one another amid a lot of interesting ambiguity . Now comes Milbry , one such novel by Bowen Ingram , who ' already has written If Passion Flies , a novel about marital troubles in middle age . Milbry , parts of which first appeared in The New Yorker , describes the ups and downs of a Tennessee family , modeled , apparently , from what is said on the jacket , after Mrs. Ingram 's own family . The story takes place mostly in the early 1900s . Milbry Prewett , the shy and rather pampered protagonist , is growing up in a well-to-do , locally prominent family of the Old South . She is shuttled about from summer home to winter home , and taught to ride properly by her cold , critical father . But her father is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ substitute in an old black servant she calls Uncle Jack . He is the one she runs to for comfort after she finds out , heartbroken , that her family is moving from Memphis . He is the one at whose funeral she lets out a terrible , anguished wail . Milbry seems closer to her family 's black " help " than to her own parents and sisters . The blacks are her family . Not that she rejects her blood kin , but simply that the blacks are more accessible . They give her their time and their warmth , commodities that Milbry 's mother and father do not toss around . The blacks and whites in the novel are miles apart in temperament . The whites are reserved , even remote , with the exception of Milbry herself who occupies neutral territory . The blacks are more human . This is a dangerous thing for Mrs. Ingram to be doing , shoving the whites into one camp and the blacks into another . It raises the question of racism . Yet Milbry is not racist , and not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for then she might be accused of condescension , or of racism in reverse . The races are kept separate here to show the way things were in the time and place Mrs. Ingram is writing about . But there is a technical reason , too , for pulling the blacks aside , and it is perhaps the most intriguing aspect of Milbry . Mrs. Ingram Uses the black characters as mirrors ( as Henry James used peripheral characters who had witnessed the action ) to reflect whatever is essential about the main characters . Those main characters happen to be a white family , the Prewetts . So when , near the end , Milbry 's mother dies of some illness , the event is not examined head-on . All we hear about her death is that Milbry does not attend her funeral because she is pregnant and has been told by her doctor not to . But Uncle Jack dies a few pages later and his funeral , which is described in detail , has an emotional force that implies his death has a larger meaning . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weep and had not , " Milbry says . She weeps for her mother 's death , which as far as we have been able to see she has not wept over before . Now her mother 's death is conjured up , reflected in Uncle Jack 's . Mirrored in that death , it is made visible to Milbry and to us . That technique has another , rather ' contradictory , effect . It makes the blacks and the whites look alike . The paradox is inevitable : Mrs. Ingram separates the blacks to use them as mirrors , but the blacks end up as identical to the whites since ' a mirror reproduces its subject . This transformation occurs subtly but should not be ' overloOked , as it raises the issue of black identity . The blacks , supposedly so temperamentally different from the whites here , slip into white behavior . When , on leaving Memphis , Milbry throws her arms about Uncle Jack , a black cook nearby scolds , " Hush up ! You wanta disgrace us all ? " And one day Milbry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treats the poignant moment with an archness Milbry 's mother had taught her to summon . These blacks are proud of their heritage , all right , and feel the need to keep up appearances because of it , but it is not their black ancestors and relatives who give them pride . It is the whites they work for . They have adopted white identities , white social pretensions , as readily as they might have accepted , in this context , hand-me-down clothes . The important thing , of course , is what the mirrors reveal about the Prewetts . The family are aristocrats on a small scale , with starchy notions about the way people ought to act . Between family members , there is formality that seems exaggerated even in the era in which Milbry occurs . Other families in the novel are warmer , if less presentable , including the family of Thomas Wolfe , whom Milbry ( read Mrs. Ingram ) collides with on a visit to Asheville : One afternoon , as I neared the end of the block , a bunch of children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with a sign reading Dixieland . They were followed by a slatternly woman , who called after them gaily , " Now y'all stay out awhile ! You hear me , Tom Wolfe ! " Milbry 's mother warns her not to go near the Wolfes again . Ultimately , whether because of this aloofness or not , the family falls apart . Milbry 's parents divorce . Milbry grows up to marry , and lives in a two-room apartment that is a far cry from the Prewett homestead where she had spent most of her childhood . The homestead is sold in the depression . There is more than a hint here of Wolfe 's belief that " you ca n't go home again , " carrying with it the familiar message that the Old South is dead or , in the period of Milbry , dying . Milbry 's parents break up at least in part because Mr. Prewett has been away too much , squeezing real estate money out of the South as it urbanizes . If Milbry fits the description of a Southern novel , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place , there are the reflected ' manners and character of black and white , which are fascinating to watch . Then there is Mrs. Ingram 's practice of telling the story through anecdotes , with sizable time gaps between , which creates the sensation , as we read , of constantly arriving at some surprise , some lurch forward . Nevertheless , the best part of Milbry is its traditional content , its affectionate reminiscence of growing up . Mrs. Ingram deserves credit for that , and for bending her old-fashioned material into unexpected shapes that especially please the eye . ? .
