txt President Ford is reported to be looking hard at some form of long-range grain trading arrangements with the Soviet Union , as controversy over the sales intensifies among longshoremen and farmers . Longtime Ford associate Melvin Laird told newsmen Aug. 19 that Mr. Ford was making a judgment on how best to deal with Moscow on a long-term basis since , Mr. Laird said , it made no planning sense to deal with Soviet needs on an emergency basis ? " whenever they come to the U.S. " Current emergency-style trading , Mr. Laird said , meant that U.S. offibials " are letting the Soviet Union trade the socks off exporters from the U.S. " Later , Mr. Laird told this newspaper that Mr. Ford had the option of going for some kind of long-term arrangement , such as the three-year agreement for grain sales with the Japanese . A spokesman for Agriculture Secretary Earl Butz said it would be helpful if the Soviet Union would build up its capacity to store grain , so that it could enter the U.S. market more evenly each year . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said ; Secretary Butz is urging the Soviets to compensate by storing more grain , instead of making sudden large purchases which cause prices to fluctuate . Reuben J-Ohnson of the National Farmers Union agreed that at times the Soviets had been " somewhat disruptive " in the world grain trade because they were " in and outers . " At the same time , East Coast and Gulf longshoremen have their eyes on more jobs for their union as well as rising prices for the consumer as they refuse to load any grain shipments for the Soviet Union until they are assured that domestic prices will not shoot up as they did in 1972 . President Ford said in Minneapolis Aug. 19 that he was " disturbed " by the action of the longshoremen. // * U.S. grain export tangle continues to grow // And U.S. farmers are up in arms at the longshoremen 's actions , demanding the right to export the huge crop they have grown . Currently , sales to Moscow are suspended by Mr. Butz while the U.S. assesses the exact size of the crop ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one , though still a record . The International Longshoremen 's Association ( ILA ) ? in concert with other U.S. maritime unions ? want to use the grain sales to provide more and higher-paying jobs for American seamen and ships . At issue are the number of U.S. vessels , as opposed to foreign , that will carry this year 's corn , wheat , and other grains ? 9.8 million tons so far has been ordered by the Soviets , with more to come ? and the freight rates involved . In October , 1972 , the U.S. and Soviet Union signed a maritime agreement , stipulating that one-third of the grain bought by Moscow would be shipped in American vessels , one-third in Soviet ships , and the final third in ships of other nations . Partly because of the Vietnam War , shipping was tight and American owners voluntarily gave up their full quota . Now , however , merchant traffic is slack and U.S. maritime unions and shipping firms want a new agreement , with more than one-third of grain cargoes to be carried in American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a higher freight rate than now prevails . So is the U.S. Maritime Administration , since ? under current U.S. law ? low rates must be supported by subsidies from the U.S. Treasury to American shipping firms . Meanwhile , " the only thing , " says Joseph Halow , executive vice-president of Great Plains Wheat , Inc. , " that persuaded American farmers to produce a crop this size was the prospect of selling it . " At least two-thirds of this year 's wheat crop , said Mr. Halow in a telephone interview , estimated at 2.1 billion bushels , " must be exported . " Otherwise , he added , farmers will be left with huge carryover stocks , prices will plummet , and next year will see a " substantial reduction " in the amount of land sown . President Ford says that , without maximum U.S. farm exports , " we would have a huge balance of payments deficit , our dollar would be weakened in foreign markets , and we would pay higher prices for the many items we import every day .
