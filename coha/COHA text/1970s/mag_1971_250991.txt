Driving the 1,340 miles of Highway 95 from New York to Florida is at best a tiresome two-night , nine-meal trek . It costs about $150 for a group of four . But thousands of vacationers continue to make the grim odyssey rather than opt for relatively cheap air flights , for the simple reason that a Florida holiday virtually demands an automobile , and rentals there during peak seasons are prohibitive . <P> Now that trip will no longer be necessary , thanks to the new Auto-Train . Modeled on the excellent auto-bearing passenger trains of Europe and Canada , the Auto-Train will begin running daily from the Washington suburb of Alexandria , Va. , to Sanford , Fla. , on Dec. 6 . The train will carry 90 to 104 vehicles in several enclosed carrier cars for a flat fee of $190 per car and group of four passengers . It will leave the new Alexandria station at 8 p.m. , stop only for brief crew changes , and arrive at 11 o'clock the following morning in Sanford , a pleasent 3-hour drive from Fort Lauderdale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obvious convenience , Auto-Train promises to be , well , almost half the fun . In an age when rail passengers count themselves lucky if they can get stale sandwiches and warm soft drinks , the Auto-Train will seem like Queen Elizabeth 2 on wheels . For adults , there will be cocktails and complimentary hors d'oeuvres in each of the 13 full-dome coaches . The kids will be entertained with cartoons and a G-rated movie . At 9 p.m. , a sitdown buffet will be served ( Beef Wellington or lobster ) , followed by another movie for the grownups and drinks until 3 a.m. in a lounge complete with vocalist . For an extra $40 , a couple can have a compartment that includes TV set and breakfast in bed . <P> After just one ad ( on Oct. 4 ) in selected Northeastern newspapers , the Auto-Train has been booked for all of December and part of January . Principal credit for the operation goes to its president , Attorney Eugene Garfield , 35 , who was serving as assistant to Transportation Secretary Alan Boyd in 1969 when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the project . Bankers refused the group additional money . As Garfield recalls : " The reaction we got was ' Who would start a railroad in the year 1969 ? ' " But even as major cities like Dallas were losing rail passenger service , Garfield and his associates then turned to the public , sold 700,000 shares of common stock at $10 a share to buy equipment . Thus they are launching their operation debt-free . The Seaboard Coast Line provides the crews , maintenance and track for this lavish overland cruise .
