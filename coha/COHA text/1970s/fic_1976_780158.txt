 | you can just get anything you want . I mean , if you want to watch a cockfight or drink some ancient wine or see some special movie , all you have to do is ask . The last time I was there , somebody wanted to see Dumbo , and the next thing you knew everybody was grooving on this flying elephant . " " Your friend would n't be Jeff Fields , would he ? " Her quick frown reminded him what small potatoes a Washington lawyer was alongside a movie star who could stage a cockfight or screen Dumbo . " Yes , " Penny said reluctantly , " but I 'm sort of not supposed to talk about it . He 's kind of , you know , paranoid about his privacy . " " It 's all right , " Norton told her . " I know Jeff . We met on the Presidential campaign . Back when I worked for President Whitmore . " " No kidding ? " " No kidding . Matter of fact , I 'm supposed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make him chairman of the Arts Council . " " How neat ! " Penny cried . " Does Jeff know yet ? " " Not yet . And do n't you tell him . I 'm going to call him tomorrow . " Penny 's pout worried its way into a frown . " That may not be a real good plan , " she said . " I mean , once his party gets going , he may not much feel like talking about politics . Maybe you ought to drive out with me tonight and talk to him before things get too , you know , spaced out . " " No problem getting me in ? " " Well , usually they do n't like it if you bring guys , but this is special . " Norton nodded contentedly , thinking that God must have loved lies or He would n't have made them so useful . " Do we have time for another drink ? " he asked . " No more for me , " she said . " I mean , it might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ahead . You want to dance ? " Up on the bandstand a combo was tuning up , and suddenly  | they burst into what Norton would have called a honkytonk version of " Jambalaya . " " Maybe later , " he said and waved to the waitress for another drink . " I talk better than I dance . Tell me about Jeff Fields . You know him better than I do . " Penny pouted , then grinned . " Well , the thing you 've got to understand is , Jeff 's not just another pretty face . He 's about the smartest man I ever met . I mean , you do n't have three dynamite pictures in a row on luck . And it 's not just the pictures . He reads books and hangs out with intellectuals and digs politics and all sorts of things . Of course , he likes to party too . I mean , he built that mansion and he lives like a king . There are n't many guys who can afford to live like that any more . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some of the rock stars could , but they 're mostly all wigged out on dope or religion or something . But Jeff 's been through all that , and you know what he 's into now ? Power . Politics and all that jazz . He once told me the only person in the world he looks up to is the President of the United States . Boy , you should have seen Jeff the time he showed Whitmore around his mansion . He was like the king of a little country trying to impress the king of a big country . " Up on the bandstand a young man had begun singing a song that seemed to consist entirely of grunts and groans , plus occasionally a shout of " Do it ! " and Penny grinned and jumped to her feet . " Come on , let 's dance . " Norton got up reluctantly . " I 'm not much good at this . " She took his hand and led him toward the dance floor . " Did you read that book Fear of Flying ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought it was about airplanes or something . Wow , was I wrong ! Anyway , she says in there that dancing is like sex , it 's not how you look , it 's how you feel . " Norton , who was n't feeling too well , but was determined to humor this strange creature , stepped onto the dance floor and began to wiggle his bottom as unobtrusively as possible . The  | young man on the bandstand kept groaning and shouting " Do it ! " and Penny burst into some amazing gyrations , but Norton 's mind stayed stubbornly on the mystery that had brought him to Palm Springs . After they had finished the dance and returned to the table , he squeezed her hand and said as casually as possible , " Say , Penny , when was it that Fields showed Whitmore around his place ? " " Huh ? Oh , last summer , right after he moved in . There was a problem with the swimming-pool pump and they had to fly a guy in from L.A. to fix it so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off from the campaign to rest up . Did n't you know ? " " I guess I 'd forgotten . " " They did sort of keep it secret . That 's the great thing about a place like that . You build a wall around it and nobody has to know what goes on inside . I guess the White House is sort of like that too . " " Sort of , " Norton said . " Do you think we ought to get going ? " " I guess so , " she said . " Listen , Ben , there 's just this one thing . " " What 's that ? " " Well , we 'll go to the party together , but when we get there we wo n't exactly be together . It 's not that kind of party . " " I understand , " Norton said , and she hugged him in appreciation and they were on their way .  | 8 PENNY GUIDED her rented Mustang down the hill from the Canyon Hotel , past Mawby 's , past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shops , out Bob Hope Drive and past the Annenberg estate and into the silver moonlight of the desert . To Norton the desert seemed somehow to stretch into the past  --  he half expected to see wagon trains and bands of Indians  --  and then it stopped abruptly in the present , at the dark tangled wall of tropical plants and chain-link fence that guarded Jeff Fields 's estate . They drove on until they reached a gatehouse whose flat-faced , vaguely Oriental guardian scowled at Norton , quizzed Penny , but waved them past once she let fall the magic phrase ? " a friend of the President " ? that opened all doors , even in this unreal desert . A long driveway twisted between towering palm trees , then stopped at a hulking white-walled Spanish-style mansion . Penny parked the Mustang between a Morgan and a Mercedes , then they walked hand in hand across a lawn as springy  | as a putting green , up the steps , through the open door , and into the elaborate confusion of Jeff Fields 's party . All the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sleek and lovely , clad in everything from bikinis to ball gowns , some with little silver spoons hanging from tiny chains around their necks . Norton recognized one cover girl and one Senator 's well-traveled wife , but the rest were a blur of anonymous beauty . The men were more a mixed bag . He recognized a couple of rock singers , some young actors , a few giants from the world of sport , and one cluster of older men whose cool eyes , permanent tans , and peacock clothing marked them as movie makers . A few men spoke to Penny , but no one paid any attention to Norton , a fact that annoyed him ; in Washington people at least found out who you were before they ignored you . They took goblets of pink-hued punch from a passing waiter , drifted down a hallway toward the back of the house , heard shouts from the kitchen , and looked in to see the biggest man Norton had ever laid eyes on holding a refrigerator off the floor while an ancient white-coated Chinaman pleaded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get away from him , " Penny whispered . " Who is he ? " " He plays football . He 's an absolute animal . He was balling a friend of mine one time and he flashed in her face . On purpose . " " Different strokes for different folks , " Norton muttered and followed her onto a long flagstone terrace that overlooked a swimming pool far down the lawn . The pool glowed an eerie green , and the people near it moved like phantoms in its pale light , laughing , smoking , drinking , sometimes swimming . A few of them were naked ; otherwise it might have been any poolside party . " See that girl by the diving board ? " Penny said . " What about her ? " " Her name 's Melinda . She 's a super-groupie . She says she 's  | balled all the Stones and all but one of the Beatles . But she 's getting kind of old now . " Norton , stranded between worlds , thought of Gwen , who sometimes claimed to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one President . He wondered if there was some international scoring system and how Gwen 's record might stack up against Melinda 's . Did Ringo Starr outclass Ted Kennedy ? He watched Melinda for a moment , cavorting beside the diving board with a bearded rock guitarist , and when he turned back to Penny he noticed a slender young man standing in the shadows at the far end of the terrace . The young man was wearing sneakers , a bathing suit and a polo shirt , and holding a can of Coors beer , but there was something in his stance , in his sheer relaxation amid this swarm of frantic people , that told you all this was his . " There 's our host , " Norton said to Penny , and just then Jeff Fields crossed the terrace to join them . " Jeff ! " Penny cried . " You remember Ben Norton ? From Washington ? " The actor 's glance was cool and calculating . " You 're the one who called , " he said . " Donna 's friend . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Run and play , " Fields told her , never taking his eyes off Norton . " The gentleman and I want to talk . " " Ca n't I listen ? I brought him . " " This is business , puss . Why do n't you go for a swim ? " He gave Penny a smile that made her glow with delight , and with a shrug to Norton she drifted down toward the pool . It was a trick Norton recognized from the political world , the affectionate dismissal , but Fields was not affectionate when he turned back to his uninvited guest . " How 'd you get in here ? " he asked . " I conned the girl . It was n't her fault . " " No , it was my fault , for giving that crazy chick the run of the place . But you 're here now , so let 's talk . Come on , we can sit over here . "  | He led Norton to a picnic table beneath some palm trees . A waiter appeared and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bring them beer . They watched as Penny emerged naked from the cabana beside the pool and jumped into the water with a yelp of pleasure . A moment later the football player who 'd been juggling the refrigerator raced screaming down the lawn and threw himself into the pool , sending a tidal wave of water into the air . " That drunken fool , " Fields muttered . " You start with a few friends , Norton , and then you get your friends ' friends , and the next thing you 've got a zoo . " The actor sighed , took a six-pack of Coors from the waiter , and handed one to Norton . " Okay , you came a long way to see me . What 's on your mind ? " " You know about Donna , do n't you ? " " I saw the newspaper stories . I was sorry about it . Do they know what happened ? " " Not yet . It could have been a prowler . " " It 's a dangerous city . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " What do you mean ? " " Your house in Georgetown . The one she was killed in . " " Who says it 's mine ? " " A friend of Donna 's told me you 'd bought it or leased it or whatever it was . " " Who else knows that ? " " The police will find it out eventually . " " It may take them a while , " the actor said . " I bought it in someone else 's name . " Norton thought it strange that Fields had n't already been contacted by the police . Ed Murphy knew that the actor had the house in Georgetown . Either Ed had been slow in passing that information along to the police , or the police had been slow in following up on it . " Why all the secrecy about a house in Washington ? " he asked .  | " Why ? So I can go there without being bugged by gossip columnists and autograph hounds and would-be screenwriters . " " But what was Donna doing there ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me if she could use the place and I said sure . " " Called from where ? " " Wherever it was she was living . Carmel ? " " Why was she going to Washington ? " " I did n't ask . " " You 're not very curious , are you ? " The actor considered him coldly . " Look , Norton , you crashed my party , you 're asking a lot of questions I do n't have to answer , and now you 're getting obnoxious . I should have you thrown out of here . " Norton returned the actor 's stare . He had that fine feeling that comes with being angry with someone fifty pounds lighter than oneself . " Go ahead , " he said , " but I 'll break that pretty nose of yours first . " Fields studied him with the intent look of a man making a perplexing decision , then he shrugged and gave Norton a goodfellow smile . " Look , Ben , there 's no use in us having a brawl . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worked for Whitmore ? Okay , so did I. We 're on the same side . And I 'll answer your questions . Just do n't push me . Okay ? " " Okay , " Norton agreed . " To start , how well did you know Donna ? " " We were friends , " Fields said . " You know how people are thrown together during a campaign . I took her out a few times . I liked her . She was bright and she was honest . There was no romance , if that 's what you mean . She did n't approve of my life style . " " How much did you know about her and Whitmore ? " Norton asked abruptly . " I did n't know anything about her and Whitmore , " the actor said sharply .  | " Is it true that she wrote a screenplay for you ? " Norton asked . " She wrote something for me , but I would n't call it a screenplay . It was more like a memoir . She thought she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her to put something on paper in whatever form she could . As it turned out , she had some interesting ideas . " " What kind of ideas ? " The actor sipped his Coors and stared up at the starlit California sky . Down at poolside the huge football player was tossing Penny into the air like a rag doll , and some other people had started a game of water polo . A young comedian was sitting at a table inside the cabana rolling joints , and a girl beside him was snorting cocaine through a rolled-up dollar bill . " Her basic story was about a young woman who 's in love with a politician who wo n't divorce his wife , " the actor said . " That 's conventional enough , but she had some nice detail . " " Like what ? " " Oh , a scene between the young woman and the politician 's wife . A nice sketch of the politician 's tough-guy assistant . A bedroom scene where she 's trying to get his mind off politics . Some funny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " This politician did n't happen to be a rugged fifty-year-old Senator who was about to run for President , did he ? " " She was ambiguous about that . She was ambiguous about the whole thing . " " She had good reason to be ambiguous about it , " Norton said . " I 'd like to see that manuscript . So would a lot of other people . " " That includes me , " Fields added . " What do you mean ? " " My copy was stolen . " " Jesus Christ , " Norton whispered . " What happened ? " " I have an office in town where I keep hundreds of scripts.  | Somebody broke into it . I thought all they took was the petty cash . But when Donna called about her trip to Washington , I mentioned the break-in and she asked me to check on her manuscript . When I told her it was gone , she freaked out . " " Have you told the White House about this ? " Norton asked . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Why not ? " " Ask them , " the actor said . " All I can say is Whitmore and I were pretty buddy-buddy when I was busting my ass for him , but once he got in the White House he seemed to have forgotten my name . It looks like my old buddy was using me and now he does n't need me any more . " " Politicians use everybody , " Norton said . " You should have known that . " Norton glanced down the hill and saw two men standing in the shadows at the far end of the cabana , talking and passing a joint back and forth . After a moment he saw that the supergroupie named Melinda was kneeling in front of one of the men , the bearded rock guitarist . The guitarist kept talking and smoking , but as the woman 's head began to bob violently he lost his cool , grabbed her by the hair , and danced a frantic jig as she completed the act . A few people drifted over from poolside and applauded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a beer . " Things are picking up , " Norton said . " Fun and games , " the actor replied . " Let 's go up to the house . You can stay here tonight if you want to . I 'd like to talk to you some more . " " About what ? " " About Donna . About Whitmore . I do n't know as much as I thought I knew about politics . " The party had moved to poolside and the house was all but deserted now . Fields led Norton into a library that had one wall covered with pictures of himself posing with other people . Norton recognized some of them as actors , actresses , direc-  | tors . " Here 's one of me and our friend , " Fields said . The picture showed Fields and Charles Whitmore standing in front of the cabana . Fields was grinning easily at the camera ; Whitmore stared suspiciously at it . Norton looked at the picture indifferently . He 'd seen a thousand like it  --  politicians passed them out like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There was something wrong with the picture , something he could not at first put his finger on . " I remember the day that was taken , " Fields said , but he stopped when the flat-faced man from the front gate appeared in the doorway . " Long-distance call , boss , " the man announced . " Take a message . " The man pulled the actor aside , and after a minute 's whispering Fields hurried away . The doorkeeper stood with his arms folded and eyes fixed on Norton . Norton turned back to the photograph . He was thinking that Jeff Fields seemed a decent enough fellow ; he was intelligent and he 'd been helpful . He was still thinking that , and thinking about the picture too , when the actor re-entered the library . Norton turned to him and was startled by the change that had come over him . His face was flushed , his mouth slack , and his hands shook when he lit a cigarette ; he looked like a man who had just learned of a death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the actor 's family ; he had a question he had to ask . " Jeff , about this photograph ? " " Forget it . The party 's over . Jack here will drive you back to your hotel . " " What 's the rush ? " " I do n't feel good . The party 's over . " " Okay , but first tell me who was cropped out of this picture . " " What the hell are you talking about ? " " There was a woman next to Whitmore . You can see part of her blouse , against his arm . "  | " It was my secretary . " His eyes darted from Norton to his bodyguard . " Jack , take Mr. Norton back to his hotel . " " You 're lying , " Norton said . " I can tell that 's Donna 's blouse . I gave it to her . When were they here ? " Fields whispered to his helper , then stumbled from the room . " Let 's go , buddy , " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and his smug smile dared Norton to defy him . Norton decided not to and walked past him toward the front door . " We 'll take the Imperial , " his escort said when they were outside , pointing to a car at the far end of the driveway . Norton started toward the car , wondering what news could so have shaken Jeff Fields . It was no night for bad news . He could hear music and laughter rising up from the party at poolside , and above him the desert sky glittered with a million stars . Then , as they reached the Imperial , the man behind him made a sudden move , and all the stars went out .  | THE DESERT SUNRISE was a slow symphony of purple and pink , and Norton had a fine view of it from the ditch he awoke in . Whenever he tried to move , little bombs started exploding in the back of his head , so it seemed more sensible to lie there in the warm sand and watch the new day spread across the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he found himself not far from the highway . In time a Good Samaritan appeared , in the form of a lettuce farmer in a Chevrolet pick-up , and gave him a ride all the way to his hotel . Norton gave the desk clerk a dirty look instead of an explanation and stumbled up to his room for a hot shower and some hard thinking . The shower was a success ; the thinking progressed no further than a decision to bid adieu to fabulous Palm Springs . He thought of seeking out Jeff Fields again , but he feared that he 'd only end up back in his ditch , or worse . What he really wanted to do was to get back to Washington . No one had ever knocked  | him on the head and tossed him in a ditch in Washington . Still , he had one more stop to make in California . He found Penny in the airport coffee shop , staring glumly into a cup of Sanka . She did n't even look up when he slipped onto the next stool . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Oh , hi , " she said without enthusiasm . " I do n't know what happened to it . One minute everybody is having a ball , and the next minute Jeff says we 've all got to leave . He left too . I asked him where you were , but he said you 'd already gone . The whole thing was weird . I think the Mafia 's after him or something like that . " " Why do you say that ? " " Well , there was this girl who was going to call her boy friend , and she picked up one of the upstairs phones , and she heard somebody saying , You son of a bitch , we 'll ruin you , you 'll never make another movie , ' and a lot of wild stuff like that , and Jeff was just sort of gulping , and I figure there 's not many people besides the Mafia that 'd talk to somebody as important as Jeff like that . " " She did n't hear who the other person was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up . All she wanted to do was to call her boy friend . " " Where are you off to now , Penny ? " " Oh , I guess to L.A. Hey , you want to come with me ? " " I 've got to get back to Washington . Sorry . " " That 's okay . Look . I still want to come see you in Washington , so we can play tennis and you can teach me about politics and all . " Norton said that nothing could please him more than for Penny to visit him in Washington , and that seemed to cheer her a bit . She was a wilted pixie , but she flashed her best smile and pecked him on the cheek before rushing off to catch her  | plane ; and a few minutes later Norton strolled out the gate to catch his plane , one bound north for Carmel . " I bet you thought I was dead , did n't you , fella ? " " Yes , sir , I guess I did , " Norton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by Washington standards , " the old man said . " I died twenty-odd years ago when Joe McCarthy lit out after me and I got whipped running for re-election . There ai n't nothing deader in Washington than an exSenator . I hung around town for a while , thinking I was still a useful citizen , but what I was was a turd in the political punchbowl . I mean to say , it 's like being a leper  --  folks is all mighty sorry about your affliction , but they 'd just as soon you did n't stay for dinner . " The old man 's name was Harry Nolan and four decades before he 'd been called " The Lion of the Prairie . " Norton had read about him in books on the New Deal . Sometimes the books had pictures of Harry Nolan with FDR . Now Norton had found him a few miles outside Carmel in a cottage on a hillside that overlooked the bright blue waters of the Pacific . " How 'd you find me , boy ? She did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was living at . " " She wrote me once . I had the return address . " " You the one that went to Paris ? " " That 's right . " The old man peered at him disapprovingly . " That was a lowlife thing to do , boy . You shoulda stayed and fought for her . Instead you fiddle-faddled around and let her get away from you . And now she 's dead . Piss-poor , boy , piss-poor . She was a gal worth fighting for . I just wish I 'd met her thirty or forty years ago . " " How did you two meet , Senator ? " " Well , she moved in down the way , and she kept to herself for a while , reading or writing or whatever it was she did , but  | one day that dog of hers got out and run over into my yard , so she come over and we got to talking and we hardly ever stopped talking after that . " " What 'd you talk about ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people , did n't know any history , so I 'd try to educate her . She 'd get all upset by scandals and corruption  --  lordy , it ai n't like Nixon invented anything . There was worse scandals under Grant and Harding and maybe a couple of others who never got caught . People do n't change any . What 's changed is television , telling people a lot of things they 'd be better off not knowing . " So , anyway , we 'd talk about the New Deal , which is to say I 'd talk and she 'd listen . That girl was one fine listener . I told her all about how we got TVA and how we put the screws to the Wall Street boys , and all about that old reprobate Jack Garner sitting there being Vice President for eight years and hating every day of it and a-praying morning and night for FDR to wake up dead . Lord , did you ever think what 'd happened if FDR had died before he did ? You could have had Jack Garner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Hell , you could 've had me . Franklin would have made me Vice President in ' forty-four if I 'd have had it , which I would n't . " " Did Donna have any other friends out here , Senator ? " " You know what she really liked to hear about ? She liked to hear about Lucy Rutherfurd and the so-called love affair that she ' n ' FDR was having . Hell , like I told her , all they ever did was take rides through Rock Creek Park , like a couple of kids running off and playing hooky . I went with ' em a couple of times , and there ai n't nobody else alive who can make that statement . Me ' n ' him would talk business and she 'd just sit there and listen and maybe pat his arm when we was talking about the war and it was going bad . She hardly ever opened her mouth , and when she did it was just to say , Ai n't the flowers purty ? ' or , Look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nonsense as that . But Donna , she kept after me until I told her . Hell , what did I care about Lucy Rutherfurd ? We was trying to win a war and Lucy was n't helping none . Course , Donna said she was helping , just by being there and patting his arm or making him look at the flowers and such . Maybe she was right . I never thought about it before . " You want a libation , boy ? I reckon the sun 's over the yardarm somewhere in the world . " " Sure , Senator . " " You get ' em , then . Make yourself useful . The bottle 's up there on the counter and I drink mine neat . " Norton poured them two tumblers of Jack Daniel 's , then rejoined the old man . " You in politics , boy ? " " I worked on the Hill for three years . " " Three years ? Lord , a man could n't find the bathroom in three years . I was there twenty years and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got cashiered . A politician is a strange breed of cat , boy . These professors , they come in here sometimes and want to talk about political science and all . Science ? What 's science got to do with anything ? Politics ai n't no more of a science than eating pussy is . It 's an art , and either you 're born with the talent or you ai n't . You want me to tell you about politicians , fella ? " " I wish you would , Senator . " " Well , the main thing you got to understand is they 're all the same down deep  --  it do n't matter what party they 're with  --  which is to say they 'll all cut your throat if it 'll do ' em a dime 's worth of good . The only difference between one politician and another is how he 'd go about cutting your throat . Take FDR . Say he wanted to cut your throat . You 'd be sitting there with him and he 'd be just oozing charm at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new ship-in-abottle , and then maybe you 'd blink or look out the window or something , just for a second , but when you did Franklin 'd zip across the room , wheelchair ' n ' all , and slice you ear to ear ,  | and you 'd never know he 'd done it , till the next time you turned your head and it rolled off onto the floor . " Now Harry Truman , he was n't like most politicians . He might have cut your throat , but it 'd have been more his style to punch you in the nose , or more likely to kick you in the gonads . Ike , that baby-faced fool , he 'd have prayed over you first . Hubert , he 'd have cried about how terrible it was that he had to do it to you , until you 'd have been begging him to go on and get it over with . Lyndon , he 'd have made a big sloppy speech about how it was all for your own good . Jack Kennedy , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how it was better to cut throats than to change coats or dig moats or launch boats or somesuch nonsense as that , and while he was giving out with the oratory , Bobby 'd have snuck up behind you and put the knife to you . Then there was that reprobate Nixon . You know how he 'd cut your throat ? " " How ? " " He would n't , that 's how . He was too gutless . He 'd have delegated the job to one of those skinhead bandits who guarded the door for him , and they 'd have delegated it to some right-wing loon , and he 'd have screwed up the job . That 's one rule of politics , boy , do n't delegate nothing , not if you want it done right . " " How about President Whitmore ? " Norton asked . " How would he do the job ? " " Whitmore ? Oh , that fella 's smooth . He could be another FDR , if he do n't screw up . I told him that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charisma stuff , and read up on FDR . I told him to talk to folks simple , like the fireside chats . Just go on TV and talk straight , tell folks the truth , and they 'd respect it . People ai n't dumb . They get distracted easy , but they ai n't dumb . " The old man sipped his Jack Daniel 's , and Norton asked his question as gently as he could . " When did you tell President Whitmore that , sir ? " " Huh ? "  | " When ? When did you meet him ? " " Oh , hell , I do n't know . Three , four , five months ago . Right before he was swore in . " " Just before the Inauguration ? " " That 's right . He was in Los Angeles for something , then he snuck up here to see her . He stayed the night and the next morning she brought him over to meet me . She said we was the two greatest men she 'd ever met . More @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me talked awhile and then they had to take him back to where he was supposed to be . She swore me to all kinds of secrecy , but I do n't reckon it matters much now . " " Have you told anybody else about this , Senator ? " " Boy , do you recollect what Jack Garner said about being Vice President ? " " Something about it not being worth a bucket of warm spit ? " " That 's right , except what he really said was a bucket of warm piss , but nobody 'd print that . Well , that 's what being old 's like . It 's got less pleasure in it than a gnat 's ass . ' Bout the only good thing about it is that when folks ask you something , and you do n't feel like answering , you can just sort of stare off into space and after a while they quit asking . You do n't even have to lie , unless you 'd rather . " " But somebody did ask ? " " Only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell him nothing . I spotted him for a phony right away . " " Who was he ? " " He said he was some kind of special agent . I took him for a nut . So I just sort of stared off into space and drooled a little , and pretty soon he left . " " Senator , did she tell you why she was going back to Wash-ington ? " " She did n't tell me . But anybody with the sense God gave a duck could figure it out . " " How do you mean ? " " I mean , he come out here to see her , three-four months  | ago , so now it 's her time to go see him . Course , I could be wrong . Could be she was going to check out some books from the Library of Congress or to see the cherry blossoms blossom , or somesuch . But if she was , things has changed since my day . People in love do n't never use their heads . Blast it all , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told her to stay here where she was happy and let Washington go to blazes . It 's a bad place , young fellow . If you stay there long enough , they 'll kill you , one way or another , you can depend on that . "  | I0 BACK IN WASHINGTON , Norton had work to do . Not precisely the work he had been trained to do when he studied torts and contracts in his law school days , but a more highly skilled and highly paid type of law he had learned in his years in Washington . He knew why Whitney Stone had hired him and paid him a handsome salary . Stone had pioneered a sophisticated form of recruiting young lawyers . Many firms had for three decades recruited lawyers who had worked for , and presumably had continuing influence with , whatever politician happened at that moment to inhabit the White House . Whitney Stone , ever a gambler , had carried the process further and begun recruiting men with lines to potential Presidents . They were cheaper then , and if their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could always be disposed of . Norton supposed he was one of Whit Stone 's better gambles , for Senator Whitmore had only been a dark horse for the Presidency when Stone  | had snapped him up . And he had been most agreeable about it . He had gone along with Norton 's desire to leave Washington for a while , although he obviously thought it rather soft-headed of a young lawyer to leave a potential President , and Norton knew he had done a good job for the firm in Paris . But now his ex-boss was President , and it was time for him to do a good job for the firm in Washington . That was what he had been hired for . Norton understood the system and had more or less reconciled himself to it . Connections were the name of the game . The trick was to use them properly , to walk the narrow , sometimes almost invisible , line between friendship and influence peddling , and he thought he could do that as well as anyone . His ties to Whitmore might get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long run it would be his own skill and integrity that would keep him there . Or so he hoped . Thus , the day after his return from California he climbed out of a cab and approached the mighty fortress that houses the U.S. Department of Justice , hoping to discover how certain officials of its anti-trust division would respond if a politically ambitious Texas oilman and newspaper publisher bought fourteen hillbilly radio stations in South Texas . Norton thought he already knew the answer to the question , but he was n't being paid to guess . He stepped into the building and found himself face to face with a sleepy-eyed security guard ; Norton could remember when there were no guards at the Department of Justice . " I 'm Mr. Norton , " he said . " I have an appointment with Allen Gillespie . " The guard looked at him blankly and reached for a pale blue telephone directory . " He 's a special assistant to the Attorney General , " Norton said . The guard continued to thumb through the book until he found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | nounced " Mr. Martin , " and after a moment of confusion handed the receiver to Norton . " Mr. Norton ? Mr. Gillespie asked if you would meet him for coffee down in the cafeteria , " a secretary said . " He 'll be there as soon as he can . " Norton frowned and started toward the dismal little basement cafeteria . He thought this not the best possible start to his mission . Al Gillespie could just as easily have entertained his old friend in the Attorney General 's private dining room . But of course they were not really friends . They had been colleagues on Whitmore 's staff for a year , rivals in a sense , and he doubted that Gillespie had been brokenhearted by his departure . But Al was smart , and he was a political animal , and Norton thought he had a better chance of getting the information he wanted from him than from the former law professor who now headed the antitrust division . Gillespie joined him in the cafeteria fifteen minutes later . He was a plump @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he looked . They shook hands and Gillespie sat down and began to stir his coffee impatiently . " How 've you been , Ben ? " Norton said he 'd been fine . " Which firm was it you went with ? " Norton told him , certain that Gillespie knew exactly which firm he 'd gone with . " You picked a strange time to leave us . " " I 'm perverse , " Norton said . " When everybody else jumps on the bandwagon , I jump off . " " I heard you might jump back on . " " Where 'd you hear that ? " " I heard it . Are you ? " " I doubt it . " Gillespie 's glance suggested that he thought his old colleague was demented . That did n't bother Norton . He was wondering how Gillespie knew that Ed Murphy had been  | dangling jobs before him . Maybe Ed had told Gillespie to check out the available slots at Justice . He began to think this meeting might be more complicated than he 'd foreseen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of professional ups and downs , and perhaps Gillespie was thinking that he and Norton might wind up as colleagues again . Which was fine for him to think . Norton played out the string . He asked about Gillespie 's work and listened intently as Gillespie boasted about the many achievements of the new , revitalized Department of Justice . Norton tried to look impressed by the litany , although it was one he 'd heard before from other bright young men in other administrations . Then Gillespie changed the subject abruptly . " Too bad about Donna , " he said . Norton nodded . " I thought you two were going to get married . " " We did n't . " " What do you think happened ? " " I do n't know . " " No theories ? " " I 'm not a cop , Al . " " I know you 're not a cop . I thought you might be looking into it . " " I do n't have any theories . " Gillespie looked skeptical . Norton wondered how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ever found out from someone like Gillespie . They talked about the Justice Department some more until they had finished their coffee . It was time to go , and neither man had hinted that this was more than a visit between two old friends . Then Gillespie surprised him again . " What 've you been working on , Ben ? " Norton took it as no casual remark . Gillespie was making it easy for him . " Oh , odds and ends , " he said . He tossed some coins on the table and they started out of the cafeteria . " One interesting anti-trust thing . A fellow named  | Baxter , owns some newspapers down in Texas and wants to buy some radio stations , but no one knows which way your fellows would jump . " They walked down the hallway between huge WPA murals of farmers toiling in rocky fields . At the elevator Gillespie turned to him with an absolutely blank expression on his face . " Radio stations ? " he said , as if to himself . He made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was , for Al Gillespie , a most uncharacteristic gesture . " Good to see you , Ben , " he said and punched the elevator button . " My pleasure , Al . " The elevator rattled its way toward them . " You representing any tire companies ? " " Nope . " " You 're lucky . " Then the elevator doors opened and Al Gillespie stepped through them and was gone . Three minutes later , back in his fifth-floor office next to the Attorney General 's office , Al Gillespie made a call to the White House , but Norton did n't know that . All he knew as he walked away from the Justice Department was that he would bet his last dollar that the anti-trust division would n't let out a peep if Harvey Baxter bought up all the radio stations in the state of Texas . The shrug would have been enough , because he knew his man well enough to translate the shrug , and it came out something like " You idiot , do you really think we 're going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in case Norton had been too dim-witted to understand the shrug , Gillespie had dropped his line about the tire companies , which made it crystal clear to Norton where the perennially undermanned anti-trust division would be focusing its energies in the months ahead . Norton knew all he needed to know except the " why , " and he thought about that for a while , because in Washington it was always necessary to look gift horses in the mouth .  | And he thought he understood the " why " too ; it was not all that subtle . He thought that Ed Murphy had talked to Gillespie about this visit . He thought that because of the remark about a job , and also because Gillespie had been pumping him about Donna 's death . Norton suspected that Gillespie 's million-dollar shrug was just Ed Murphy 's way of tossing a few crumbs his way , reminding him how helpful the White House could be to Washington lawyers who did n't make waves . That was fine . He would take their favors and he would keep on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finding out the truth about Donna . They could underestimate him if they wished . That was their problem .  | 11 NORTON THOUGHT the finest actresses he had ever seen were Katharine Hepburn , Liv Ullmann , Julie Christie and Frances Hall , and sometimes he believed Mrs. Hall was the best of them all . Of course , Mrs. Hall was unknown to the public at large , and the circumstances of her career had restricted her to one specific , tragic role , but within that role she was beyond comparison . He trembled to think what she might have done as Medea or Lady Macbeth or Mary Tyrone , but she did quite well enough as Ed Murphy 's secretary in the anguished portrayal she gave several times each week as she broke the news to some do-gooder or favor seeker that Ed Murphy was not going to see him . In that recurring scene Fran Hall would twist her normally placid face into a mask of pain , tortured tears would well in her soft blue eyes , the twist and flutter of her gentle hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recited the  | awful facts about Murphy 's back-breaking schedule , his failing health , his suicidal devotion to the President 's urgent needs , his vast remorse that he would not now or in the foreseeable future be able to work Mr. Favor Seeker into his schedule . She could , as Nick Galiano had once observed , wring tears from a dog turd . The success of her performances was aided , of course , by the fact that few denizens of the political world were willing to accept the unspeakable possibility that Ed Murphy did not want to see them . It was far easier to take Mrs. Hall 's excuses at face value , and to go away believing that on that particular week Murphy could not have worked the Shah of Iran into his schedule . Ben Norton was no ordinary appointment seeker , however . He knew the game and , as much as he admired Mrs. Hall 's talents , he refused to be moved . " It 's pretty important , Mrs. Hall , " he said into the telephone . " To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is , Ben ? " " Just tell him it 's a follow-up to our talk the other day . " She would , of course , be annoyed by his refusal to confide in her . No matter . " Well , I 'll do what I can . " She sighed . " I 'll get back to you . " She did n't get back , so he called again the next day . " Oh , Ben , I was just about to call you . Mr. Murphy has n't had a free instant . But I gave him your message , and he suggested you talk to Clay McNair . " " I do n't think that would help . " " He 's a quite capable young man , Ben , " she said , chiding now . " Mr. Murphy relies on him a great deal . " " Mrs. Hall , just tell Ed that I have some new information and I think he 'd be well advised to discuss it with me . " " I 'll tell him , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her voice .  | Whitney Stone had been most pleased by Norton 's success at the Justice Department . When told of it , he had even smiled , a rare occurrence and an unfortunate one , for there was something cobralike about his face , and when cobras smile it destroys the otherwise interesting symmetry of their features . He had n't questioned the validity of Norton 's information , or even pressed him as to its source . He had accepted it and acted upon it . " I just spoke to Baxter , " he told Norton that afternoon . " He was delighted by our report , needless to say , and he 's moving at once to acquire the radio stations . " " He really wants those stations , does n't he ? " " Yes , he 's persuaded himself they are the key to his political future . Perhaps they are . Who knows ? " A yellow light flickered on Stone 's telephone console . Stone picked up the receiver , listened a moment , then cupped his small freckled hand across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Ben , " he announced . " Would you like to take it here ? " " Sure , " Norton said and leaned across the desk to take the receiver . " Ben ? " Mrs. Hall said , her voice ringing with good will . " Can you come right over ? " " I 'll be there in fifteen minutes , " Norton promised . He handed the receiver back to Whitney Stone , who had listened with unconcealed interest . " Ed wants to see me right away , " he explained , hoping Stone would n't ask what Murphy wanted to see him about . " You and Murphy seem on quite cordial terms these days , " Stone said . " We always got along well , " Norton said . Stone walked him to the door of his office , then touched his arm lightly before he opened it . " You know , Ben , if the administration should make you an attractive job offer ,  | something commensurate with your abilities , the firm would of course be most understanding . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better for the firm than having a young lawyer with lines to the administration was having a young lawyer in the administration . " I appreciate it , Whit , " he said . " We 'll see what happens . " He was n't about to tell Stone that he did n't want a job in the administration ; as long as the possibility seemed to exist , he had an aura of potential power that was itself a kind of power . When he entered Mrs. Hall 's office , she greeted him with a look of unspeakable anguish . " Oh , Ben , " she cried , " Mr. Murphy was all set to see you , and then the President called him in and it may go on for hours . " She paused , then brightened . " But let me tell you what Mr. Murphy did . " Just then , as if on cue , Clay McNair entered the room . He was still wearing his college ring and his earnest face , but he 'd replaced his pin-striped suit with a sincere-looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any way he can , " Mrs. Hall said . McNair strode forward , with boyish smile and outstretched hand , and Norton knew he 'd been sandbagged . " Let 's go down to my office to talk , Ben , " McNair said . Norton gave up and followed McNair down the stairs to the White House basement . McNair 's office proved to be tiny  --  from its size and location it might once have been Henry Kissinger 's broom closet  --  barely big enough to hold the two desks jammed into it . " Space is tight , " McNair said defensively . " You know how it is . But the guy who shares this one with me is a kind of consultant who 's not here much , so it 's like having an office to myself . My secretary 's down the hall . " " Who is he ? " Norton asked . " Oh , a fellow named Byron Riddle . A funny guy . " Norton shrugged and sat down at Byron Riddle 's desk , which was bare except for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . McNair 's desk , by contrast , was covered with neatly arranged stacks of memos , and it also held a photograph of McNair 's wife , who looked wanly pretty , and his children , who were blond and toothy . Identical pictures of President Whitmore hung over both desks . " I thought I might see you at the funeral , " McNair began with a mournful look on his face . He was such a clean-cut young man ; Norton imagined him passing the collection plate each Sunday at some suburban Presbyterian church . " I do n't like funerals . " " It was nicely done , " McNair said . " Very tasteful . " " I do n't want to hear about it . " " Well , I thought you 'd be interested . There was one rather fascinating sidelight , just between you and I. Sergeant Kravitz had a film crew hidden across the street to have a record of who was there . " " Wonderful . " " Well , Ben , that 's heads-up police work , you 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and McNair reached into his desk drawer and fished out a pack of Juicy Fruit gum . He offered a stick to Norton , who declined , then unwrapped a stick for himself and began to chew it . The act annoyed Norton , who was already annoyed to be sitting in this broom closet talking to Ed Murphy 's flunky . " Are you still in touch with Kravitz ? " he asked . " Of course . " " Then why did n't you tell him that Jeff Fields owned the house in Georgetown ? " " He what ? " " You heard me . Why did n't you tell Kravitz that ? " " I did n't know that , " McNair admitted . " Then why did n't Ed tell you ? He knew . " " How do you know he knew ? " " Because I told him , damn it . So why did n't he tell you to  | tell Kravitz , if you 're so full of cooperation for the investi-gation ? " NcNair gave him an all-forgiving smile . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's just incredibly busy . " " Look , I 've worked for Murphy . He never forgets anything . Except when he wants to . " " It 's different in the White House , " McNair said patiently . " It 's a quantum jump , Ben . He does forget things now . That 's why I 'm here , to help him get organized better . " " Ask him about Fields owning the house , " Norton said . " And while you 're at it , ask him why he called Fields in the middle of the night a few days ago . " He had started to say " if he called Fields , " but he decided the time had come to bluff . " Who says he did ? " " I do . " " Okay , I 'll pass that on . But is that the urgent matter you wanted to see Ed about ? " Norton hesitated . He disliked dealing with this agreeable fool , yet he assumed he 'd get the message through , and that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's way . " No , " Norton said . " Tell Ed I want to talk to him about the President 's trip to California last January . " McNair looked puzzled . " What trip do you mean ? " " He 'll know what I mean . " McNair frowned and scribbled something on a yellow legal pad . Just then the door opened and a man stepped in . He was about forty-five and trimly built , with close-cropped black hair and dark alert eyes that moved quickly from McNair to the stranger at his desk . " Byron Riddle , meet Ben Norton , " McNair said . Norton stood up and extended his hand , but Riddle ignored him , moving swiftly to the desk and checking all its drawers . Only then did he take Norton 's hand , gripping it  | with such ferocity that Norton had to squeeze back hard to keep from getting hurt . Throughout the handshake , Riddle kept his face close to Norton 's , staring at him with such intensity that he had the odd sensation that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used to work for the President , " McNair said . " On his Senate staff . " " That right ? " Riddle said . " What 're you doing now ? " Norton did n't answer for a moment . Riddle had a strange way of speaking out of one side of his mouth that so intrigued him he almost missed the question . " Oh , I 'm in private practice . " " Who with ? " " Coggins , Copeland , and Stone . " " Good bunch , " Riddle said with a knowing nod . " But you ought to get back on the team , fellow . Big things are happening . This is where the action is . " " What position do you play on the team ? " Norton asked . " A lot of positions . I 'm what you call a utility infielder . " He grinned at his joke , a rather wolfish grin , and looked at his watch . " Byron 's done some ? " McNair began , but Riddle cut him off . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said . " I 've got to get moving . Got a little lady waiting for me , and I do n't believe in keeping the fair sex waiting . " He winked and vanished out the door . " That 's a real character , " McNair said . " They broke the mold when they made Byron Riddle . Maybe you heard about what he did on Inauguration Day . " Norton started to protest  --  he was n't all that interested in Byron Riddle  --  but McNair waved him back to his chair . " The thing is , " McNair said , " Byron had done some work on the campaign . Advance work , crowd security , that type of thing , but he was a long way from rating a job in the White House . Then , on Inauguration Day , when the Presiden'ts motorcade  | Norton stood up , no longer interested in the exploits of Byron Riddle . " Look , McNair , you just give Ed my message . About California . Tell him if he wo n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some other people . " McNair looked most unhappy at that . " I do n't like the sound of this , Ben . I do n't understand what your problem is , but I think you 're barking up the wrong tree . We 're all on the same team , are n't we ? We all want to help the President . " " Fellow , I do n't give a damn about helping the President , " Norton said coldly . " I just want to find out who killed a friend of mine . You tell Ed I said that . " McNair looked as if he 'd been slapped . He was a young  | man who sought to please , and Norton inexplicably would not be pleased . But before he could protest , Norton was gone . The next day Norton was summoned again to Ed Murphy 's office , and he found Murphy in a rage . " What 's this about California in January ? " he shouted . " What kind of games are you playing ? If you 've got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I will , " Norton said . " You told me last week that Whitmore had n't seen Donna since last summer . But someone else , someone with no ax to grind , told me he went to see her in Carmel in January , just before the Inaugural . " " It 's a lie , " Murphy shouted . " He did n't see her in January . He had n't seen her in nearly a year . " " Ed , my information comes from someone who saw him . Who talked to him . " " Who ? " " A friend of hers . Ask Whitmore if you want to know who . " " That old Senator ? " " That 's right . " " He 's a crank . After the election he started writing and calling , giving the boss a lot of free advice . We tried to humor him , but he got to be a nuisance . So he got his feelings hurt , and he might have made up any story just to get somebody to listen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took him seriously . " " That old man 's no crank , Ed . " " Maybe you 're the crank , then . You 're talking crazy . You 've got a great future , Ben , but you 're gon na blow it if you do n't watch out . " " I 'm going to find out what happened . You can tell your boss that . " " This is all personal . Your girl friend throws you over ,  | you blame Whitmore . She gets killed , you blame Whitmore . What 've you got , some lousy conspiracy theory ? " " Look , Ed , I have n't said a word to anybody about Donna and Whitmore . If I was the jealous lover , I would have , would n't I ? I do n't want to cause any problems for Whitmore . All I want is the truth about what happened to Donna . But when you start conning me on little issues , it makes me think you 're conning me on bigger issues . If she came to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see her in January , why do n't you just level with me ? As long as I think I 'm getting the runaround , as long as I think people are hiding something from me , I 'm going to keep after it . So why not just tell me the truth ? " Ed Murphy glared at him , but he hesitated before answering , and when he spoke his voice seemed uncertain . " We 've told you the truth , Ben . " " Okay , Ed , " Norton said and got up . There was nothing more to say . For an instant he thought he had heard regret in Murphy 's voice , as if he wanted to tell the truth but could n't . Perhaps Whitmore was making all the decisions in this matter . That was possible . But something else was possible too , Norton thought . Perhaps Ed Murphy was right and he was jumping to conclusions . What if Phil Ross had been wrong about seeing Donna and Murphy together ? What if the old Senator was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In that case Ed Murphy was right . He was a damn fool , and he could be ruining whatever future he had in this city . Norton was torn by uncertainty . Was he being carried away by his passions ? Was he seeing plots where none existed ? He knew the kind of people who wandered about town obsessed with this or that conspiracy theory  --  that the oilmen killed JFK , that Jack Ruby was in the hire of the Mafia , that the Klan had paid for Dr. King 's murder  --  and he had never imagined himself joining their ranks . He was a reasonable man , and  | part of him feared that he might be behaving like a fool . Yet Donna was dead . That was a fact . And he believed Ed Murphy was lying to him . And he did n't think Senator Nolan had been lying about the trip to Carmel . And there was that unexplained phone call that had told him of the murder . He might be wrong , but his best judgment was that the evidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man , and that was enough to keep him going , at least for a little longer .  | 12 WHEN BYRON RIDDLE stepped into the office at noon , Clay McNair looked up from his pile of memos and felt a sharp pain deep in his stomach . I am getting an ulcer , he thought . This madhouse is giving me an ulcer . He braced himself for a showdown . " Byron , where is that security report ? Ed 's been calling about it . " " Get off my back , Buster , " Riddle snapped . " I 've got some top secret assignments I 'm working on . " " Look , Byron ? " " You look , Buster . What the hell do you mean letting that Norton character sit at my desk the other day ? You think this is Grand Central Station ? If I ever catch anybody else using my desk , I 'll throw their ass out of here and you too ! " McNair could n't believe it . " Byron , what difference does  | it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't care if somebody sits at my desk . Let 's be reasonable . " " We 're not talking about your desk , " Riddle said scornfully . " Sometimes I have important documents in my desk . " " Byron , " McNair said patiently , " Ben Norton is not exactly an enemy agent , and I was sitting here with him , and anyway your desk drawers are locked , are n't they ? " " Who says he 's not an enemy agent ? Do n't assume anything , Buster . You might have gone to the head for a minute and that 's all the time he 'd need . " " Byron , the Secret Service said that the locks on these desks are ? " " Screw the Secret Service , " Riddle shot back . " A bunch of girls . What do they know ? Listen , Buster , the lock 's never been made that a real pro ca n't handle . There are some new electronic devices that . . . Look , you just do what I tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take them down to the mess , and lock the door behind you . Understand ? If I ever see anybody within ten feet of my desk again , you and me are gon na have problems . Bad problems . " McNair started to protest , but Riddle stormed out of the office , slamming the door behind him . McNair sat motionless at his desk , with the pain in his stomach growing worse . It was such an impossible situation . Clay McNair believed in good organization and good management , and here he was trying to deal with Byron Riddle , who was without doubt the most disorganized , unmanageable person he 'd ever met . The idea of the two of them sharing an office seemed to McNair to be an insane , sadistic joke , yet here they were , eyeball to eyeball in their broom closet . McNair wanted to complain to Ed Murphy about their freewheeling consultant , and yet he was n't sure how Murphy would respond . Riddle was useful sometimes , there was no denying that ; he seemed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ existed . And , worst of all , Clay McNair was afraid of him . When they argued , as they had just now , Riddle would sometimes fix him with that cold , furious stare that seemed to say , I could kill you . McNair took a stick of Juicy Fruit from his pocket and began to chew it , trying to calm himself . This was not what he had expected when he had been offered a job on the White House staff . He had imagined himself in a fine office near the President 's own office , striding down the hallway several times each day to advise the President on affairs of state . Instead , he found himself slaving in a cubbyhole in the White House basement waiting for angry calls from Ed Murphy about this or that fouled-up assignment , and it was a big week if he even saw the President . The last time they 'd spoken was in a receiving line in the East Room and the President had called him Hank and praised his work on a project he 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line " rang suddenly  --  his direct line to Ed Murphy  --  and he grabbed it with a trembling hand . " Has Norton been back in touch with you ? " Murphy demanded . " No , Ed . " " Do n't talk to him any more . Take a message , report to me , and keep your mouth shut ! Understand ? " " Right , Ed . " " And forget what he said about California . The guy has a screw loose . He always was a nut . The best thing we can do is steer clear of him . " " Right , Ed , " McNair said again , but Murphy had already hung up . Clay McNair lowered the receiver gently . He was a most perplexed young man . He did n't understand why Ed Murphy was so upset about the death of one woman , or why Norton kept asking so many questions about her . But in truth he really did n't want to know . That was one of the rules of good management he 'd learned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's problems . He had problems enough of his own . Byron Riddle spent the late afternoon sitting high in the Senate gallery , coolly studying the disorderly spectacle of democracy . The issue of the day was the public-works bill , a proposal of such far-reaching importance to the nation that nearly a third of the Senators were on hand for the debate . Most of the time Riddle focused his attention on Senator Donovan Ripley , the aggressive young leader of the propublic-works forces . Riddle loathed Ripley and everything he stood for , yet there was a smug smile on his face as he watched the Senator guide the bill through the parliamentary minefields . Have your fun , Donnie , he thought . Have your fun while you can , because it 's not gon na last much longer . As the debate droned on , Riddle sometimes grew restless , impatient for the larger events of the evening to unfold . Sometimes he would close his eyes and study the various Senators ' voices as they spoke . He could identify almost all of them by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learned in his work ; you never knew when that would come in handy . Once he noticed a certain New England Senator picking his nose . Riddle leaned forward quickly and seemed to straighten his tie . In fact , he was snapping a picture with a tiny camera hidden in his lapel . That was nickel-and-dime stuff , but you never knew when it would be useful . He imagined the nose picking blown up on a campaign poster with the legend " Is this what we picked ? " Riddle laughed at that until an elderly lady two rows in front of him turned around and shushed him . When the Senators finally adjourned , Riddle watched Donovan Ripley march off the floor , surrounded by anxious aides , then Riddle left the gallery and hurried to the nearest pay  | phone . He dialed a number and a young woman in a small apartment a few blocks away answered quickly . " Wendy ? " he whispered . " It 's me . " " Oh , Dr. Green . What 's happening ? " " Everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by his office now . He wo n't be over there until it 's dark . Is everything set ? " " Well , I 'm set , " Wendy said . " Nervous ? " " Maybe just a little . " " Do n't worry , kid . You 're gon na be great . " " Ha ! He 'll think so . " Riddle grinned into the telephone . " He wo n't know the half of it . Look , just do n't forget about the lights . Tell him that 's what turns you on . Tell him you want to see his pretty face . Tell him anything , but keep those lights on ! " " Do n't worry , Dr. Green . You can count on me . " " Good girl . I got ta go now . " " Look , when do I see you again ? What about the rest of the money ? " " I 'll call you tomorrow , " he promised . " Just keep cool . You 're gon na be great . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Washington crossing the Delaware , and was crossing the Rotunda when he saw a familiar figure coming his way , a heavy-set man who was followed by a half dozen high school students . When the man saw Riddle , he excused himself from the students and hurried over with hand outstretched . " Byron , you old dog , how the hell are you ? " " I 'm okay , Senator . How about yourself ? " " Hey , what 's this Senator stuff ? It 's Bill to you , buddy . How 's it going ? I hear you 're doing all right for yourself . " " No complaints . " The man laughed loudly and kept pumping Riddle 's hand .  | " No complaints . Ha . Same old Byron . You know what your motto ought to be , boy ? I love a mystery . ' Old Byron ! What a guy " Riddle wondered what his companion wanted . He freed his hand and looked at his watch . " How 's it with you , Bill ? " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said grimly . " A fellow 's elected to do a job and then they wo n't let you do it . You know I 'm dipping into my own pocket to pay for my newsletter ? I 'm having to give lectures now just to keep afloat . Sometimes I wonder if it 's worth it . " " There 's a fellow you ought to meet , " Riddle said . " Soybean business . New in town . Wants to meet the right kind of people . Maybe could help out . " " Send him around , Byron , send him around . Glad to meet any friend of yours , any time . " " Good , " Riddle said and started to move away . " Listen , Byron , there 's maybe something you could do for me . " The Senator put his arm around Riddle 's shoulders and led him over by the statue of a long-forgotten Vice President . " Some troublemakers back home . One of ' em claims to be a doctor . Opened this storefront clinic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is political advice . 1 'd like to know who he is and who 's behind him . " " Have you talked to our friends ? " " They 're no good . They 're all scared shitless . It 's not like the old days . Look , Byron , I thought if you could go take a look , check it out . . . " " I 'll try , Bill . I 'm up to my ears , but I 'll try . " " Okay , Byron . Look , I meant to ask you . What do you know about this little lady who got herself killed in George-town ? " " Nothing . " " Strange business , " the Senator said . " You 'd have thought the papers would do more with it . " " You know how they are . " " That 's true . Well , great to see you , buddy . You call me  | now . " The Senator winked and started back toward the waiting cluster of high school students . Riddle hurried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ East Front of the Capitol , and over to Constitution Avenue . He smoked two cigarettes before Donovan Ripley emerged from the Old Senate Office Building . Ripley walked rapidly down First Street , past the Supreme Court , and up East Capitol Street . Riddle followed half a block behind him . It was like clockwork . At Fourth Street the Senator turned to the right and walked halfway down the dark block , then darted into an old townhouse that had been converted into apartments . Riddle knew the townhouse well ; he was at present renting all three of its apartments . Riddle slipped into his car , which was parked across the street . After a minute he saw Wendy appear at the window and lower the shade . The light stayed on . Riddle lit another Marlboro and began to laugh . It was all so easy , he thought , all so easy when your enemies were as dumb as Donovan Ripley . He sat in the car until Ripley emerged from the apartment two hours later , sometimes laughing and sometimes thinking quite coldly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . It was his greatest score , his million-dollar score , and from now on the sky was the limit .  | 13 JUST AFTER he returned from lunch , Norton received an urgent and unexpected call from his boss 's secretary : Mr. Stone wished to see Mr. Norton at once . Three minutes later Norton stepped into Whitney Stone 's big dimly lit office and found the older lawyer seated immobile behind his antique desk , with a perplexed look on his narrow face . Stone stared at him for a moment , then waved him into a chair . " I just had some rather bad news , Ben , " he began . " What 's that ? " " As you know , on the basis of your report from the Justice Department , Mr. Baxter moved at once to purchase those radio stations . He signed the papers yesterday morning . " " Yes ? " " Then , this morning , a representative of the anti-trust division told Mr. Baxter that the department has serious questions about the acquisition and is considering injunctive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; he 'd been stabbed in the back , and he thought he knew why . " I 'm wondering , Ben , " Whitney Stone continued in his gentlest , most dangerous voice , " if you can shed any light on this rather embarrassing turnabout . We of course relied on your reading of the mood in the anti-trust division . Could you have been mistaken ? Or misled ? " Norton was too angry to say anything but the truth . " I do n't think I was mistaken . I think there 's a rather special problem here . Ed Murphy and I are involved in . . . well , call it a difference of opinion , on a personal matter . I think Ed was behind the open-door policy I encountered at Justice . That was Ed 's idea of friendly persuasion . But since then we 've had another talk and I 've continued to disagree with him on the other matter , so he slammed the door on me . " Whitney Stone touched his fingertips together and gazed toward the ceiling , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I appreciate your candor , " he said at last . " You see , Ben , I am not entirely unfamiliar with your , ah , difference of opinion with Ed Murphy . It has to do , I believe , with the death of your friend Miss Hendricks . " " That 's right . " " I gather that Murphy thinks you 're being overinquisitive about the matter , somewhat bothersome from his perspective , and he used this anti-trust issue to set you up , then shoot you down . Is that how you read it ? " " More or less , yes . " " Then perhaps the first question , Ben , is whether you are being overly aggressive in this matter . " " I do n't think so , " Norton said . " Donna was murdered under very peculiar circumstances . No one will say why she was in Washington in that particular house at that particular time . I think Ed Murphy knows and that he 's been lying to me . " " Do you suspect that President Whitmore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "  | " I have no reason to suspect that , " Norton said . That was the literal truth . It was also , as both he and Stone knew , something less than a flat no . " But you think Whitmore and/or Murphy may have known why she was in Washington or may have been in touch with her ? " " That 's right . " " And you are insisting that Murphy satisfy your curiosity on these points ? " " It 's more than my curiosity , Whit . I think the truth about her death should be found out , if it possibly can be . " " The truth about her death , Ben , or about her love life ? " Norton felt his anger rising . " Just a minute , Whit , " he began . " I think ? " " Do n't take offense , " Stone interrupted . " Just let me pursue that line of thought a moment , please . Let us suppose , for the sake of argument , that Miss Hendricks was killed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the night before she was killed she happened to have spoken with the President or been visited by him or whatever . Are you saying that information would be relevant to her death ? " " It could be . In any normal investigation it would be . " " Ah , precisely , " Stone said . " But this is n't a normal investigation , is it ? To the contrary , it 's most extraordinary . If you or I had visited Miss Hendricks the night before her death , no one would think twice about it . " " But we 're not necessarily talking about the night before her death , Whit . We could be talking about the night of her death . " " But you have no proof of that ? " " No . Nothing solid . " " In which case , as I 'm sure you 're aware , it becomes a most serious suggestion , one you 'd not lightly make . " " I know that . " " Of course . So , to continue my line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the young  | lady , however innocent , could , if they became known , be used to embarrass , perhaps to cripple , perhaps even to destroy his administration . So we 're dealing with a most delicate situation , and perhaps the question is the extent to which your , ah , inquiries may be rooted in your , shall I say , emotional attachment to the unfortunate young woman . " Again Norton fought back his anger . " It 's not emotional , " he insisted . " I just want the truth . Let Whitmore tell the truth like everyone else . " " The truth , " Whitney Stone repeated . " You want the truth . I wish you well in your quest , Ben , but I must note that saints and philosophers have been seeking the truth since the beginning of time , and with less than total success . For my own part , I find justice a more practical goal than truth . More men can live with justice than with truth . In the present situation , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or imprudent man , I question whether justice requires that he be punished politically for his nonpolitical indiscretions . " He smiled and lit a cigarette without taking his eyes off Norton . " I do n't want to see him hurt politically , " the younger man protested . " Of course not , " Stone said . " You only want the truth . ' But might I suggest , Ben , with no offense intended , that your own dedication to the truth in this matter has been somewhat less than total . " " What do you mean ? " " Well , I gather that you have certain information that you have chosen to pursue on your own , rather than to share with the duly authorized investigative officials . And , while I 'd not question your actions , I might note that you may have left yourself in a somewhat compromised position . " Which was a roundabout way of saying Norton might have perjured himself . Which , unfortunately , might be true . Norton wondered how Stone knew so damn much . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office ? From the police ? But  | in Washington you never pressed a man for his sources . Not much was sacred in Washington , but good sources were . " Perhaps I 've made mistakes , " Norton said . " I 've acted in good faith . " " Ah , of course , " Stone said with a little puff on his English cigarette . " Understand , Ben , I speak only as a friend who is concerned about your career . Of course , I would be less than candid if I said 1 was pleased by this Justice Department action . " " I 'm sorry about the client , " Norton said . " He 's getting screwed for something that is n't his fault . " " Well , those things happen , " Stone said . " We 'll make it up to him somehow . No , Ben , my real concern is you . I do n't want to see a promising career damaged . Let 's talk about your career for a moment . We really have n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Here , let me get you a drink . Scotch ? " Stone stepped to his liquor cabinet and quickly mixed two drinks , an act of hospitality that was , to Norton 's knowledge , unprecedented in the firm 's history . Norton was a little suspicious of Stone 's hospitality , but more than that he was determined to hear the man out . Perhaps he was being emotional . Perhaps he was throwing away his future . Stone handed him his drink and sat back down . " Now , Ben , as you look down the road , toward what I 'm sure will be a most rewarding career , what are the goals you 've set for yourself ? " Norton relaxed , savoring the question . It was nice to look down the road , the farther down the road the better . " I want to be a good lawyer , " he said . " And in the past few years , both here and on the Hill , I 've been more and more intrigued by the federal-corporate relationship . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political and economic and cultural , and it keeps evolving as the Congress writes new laws and as the corporations keep moving toward a supernational role . The whole thing needs definition . There has to be more com-  | munication between the two sides , and we 're the middlemen . There 's room for , if you 'll forgive me , some legal statesmanship , the kind that can serve both parties and the public interest too . " He paused and sipped his drink . He wondered if Whitney Stone , who was not exactly famous for serving the public interest , had any idea what he meant . " Nicely put , " Stone said . " And absolutely correct . Sometimes , Ben , I think I spend half my time trying to explain the corporate mind to politicians , and the other half trying to explain the political mind to my corporate friends . There is a need for definition . And for statesmanship . And , one might say , for philosophical considerations . What is the proper relationship between the public sector and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the master ? Or can it be a meeting of equals ? These are intriguing questions . " " Yes , " Norton said . " And damned hard questions to focus on when you 're struggling with your day-to-day caseload . " " Precisely , " Stone said . " And that 's what I want to talk to you about . Henry Willoughby will be retiring soon . That is n't known yet , but his health is failing , poor fellow . As you know , he 's been our resident philosopher , while I 've turned my attentions to more realistic concerns . But I 'll be needing a new man to oversee our corporate work . To do some writing . To testify before the appropriate Congressional committees . What I really want is someone who can emerge as a nationally recognized spokesman in the entire field of corporate-government relationships . And of course to work on those cases that most interest him . And I think you 're the man for the assignment . If you 're interested in it , of course . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hardly know what to say . " " Then do n't say anything . Just think about it , and we can discuss the details later . And of course , the importance of the assignment would be properly reflected in our financial arrangement . "  | " Whit . . . I 'm very grateful for this . " " I admire honesty , Ben . I admired the way you told me the truth about your problem with Ed Murphy . And I admire your loyalty to the young woman . All I suggest , as a friend , is that you remember that discretion and caution can be virtues too . " It was all happening too fast . They had moved so quickly from Donna to the dazzling job offer . Was Stone trying to buy him off ? Or was he insane even to think that ? He debated with himself , and once again his suspicions won out . " Whit , I ca n't give any assurances in the other matter . The question of Donna 's death . " " None have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps I should alert you to one fact that has come to my attention , on a quite confidential basis . I have , as you may have gathered , certain sources of information on the Hendricks investigation , and I am reliably informed that an arrest is at hand , probably within days . I mention this only to spare you any precipitous action . " " Whose arrest ? " Whitney Stone sighed . " I 'm afraid it 's a sad end to a sad affair . The suspect is a demented young man with a history of sex offenses , from window peeping to attempted rape . The young man worked in a Georgetown liquor store and sold her a bottle of brandy the evening of her death . Apparently he followed her home and . . . " Stone left the sentence unfinished . It was just as well he did . Norton stared at the floor , drained of emotion . So it was all over . She 'd been killed by some nut , some window peeper , and they 'd caught him and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Ben ? " Norton jerked himself back to reality . " No , thanks . If you 'll excuse me , I 'd better go . All this has been . . . Well , I 've just about had it for one day . " " Of course , Ben , " Whitney Stone said with his serpentine smile . " We 'll talk again tomorrow . "  | Norton returned to his own office in a daze . He sat there for a while , trying to balance what Stone had said about Donna against what Stone had said about this fine new assignment . His every instinct was to beware Whit Stone bearing gifts . How did he know Stone was telling the truth ? Was the kid in the liquor store really about to be arrested or had Stone made that up ? Or was he crazy to keep questioning everything and everybody ? He cursed himself for his indecision and grabbed his phone . A minute later he had Kravitz on the line . " Sergeant , " he said , " I wonder if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Not unless you 're about to kill somebody , " Kravitz said . " I 'm just leaving to see my kid pitch his Little League opener . " " Maybe I could just ask you over the phone , " Norton said . " I heard you were about to make an arrest in the Hendricks case . " " We 've made no arrest , " Kravitz said . " I understand that . But I was told that the kid in the liquor store has a history of sex offenses and he 's under investigation . " " A number of individuals are under investigation , " Kravitz said with a hint of irritation in his voice . " Yes , but can you tell me if the kid in the liquor store is one of them ? " " Look , Norton , " the detective growled , " we do n't send out advance notices before we arrest somebody . Yes , the boy is under investigation . But that 's all I 'm going to say . " " Okay , Sergeant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Norton put down the phone , satisfied at last . Of course Kravitz could n't tell him what he was going to do . But it was clear enough what would happen next . The mystery had ended , as he might have expected , not with the bang of political intrigue but with the whimper of a deranged young man . Norton shut his eyes and wondered if he 'd wanted intrigue , wanted Donna 's death to have some greater meaning than a  | prowler 's guilt would give it . Then he told himself to put such thoughts behind him . He had behaved honorably . Not wisely perhaps , but honorably , and now it was time to look ahead . He had to fight his way out of the cloud of despair that had surrounded him these past weeks . He smiled and thought of the week after he 'd finished his bar exams , when he and two friends had gone on a four-day drunk . He did n't want to get drunk now , but he wanted people , laughter , diversion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party at Gwen Bowers 's house that night . She 'd called and said she was having some people over to celebrate a friend of hers selling her first short story . It sounded like fun , and Norton thought some fun was exactly what he needed now .  | 14 HE RANG GWEN 'S doorbell twice , then he pushed open the door and walked in . He followed the sound of music and laughter down the long hallway to the library , where he found Gwen standing in front of the fireplace telling a story to eight or ten guests : " So there I am in my new ball gown in the middle of a blizzard and my car wo n't start and there 's not a cab to be had for love nor money and I 'm due at the White House in a half hour for the Party of the Year , right ? So what do I do ? What could I do ? I put on my boots and slogged down to Mass Ave and stood there in the blizzard with my thumb stuck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be precise , and I looked at the driver and he looked at me and he was without question the biggest , blackest , meanest-looking mother I have ever laid eyes on . And I seemed to remember reading in the papers about a series of vicious rapes perpetrated by a black man in a red Impala . Now that , children , is what you call a quandary .  | But I was freezing and there were n't any other cars in sight , so I hopped in and said , Look , brother , if you 're gon na ravish me , just be quick about it and do n't muss my hair , and when you 're finished drop me at the White House ! ' " The young people scattered around the library laughed politely , the way people in their twenties laugh at jokes by people in their thirties , and someone asked , " When was that , Gwen ? " " Oh , centuries ago , " she said . " Back in the last days of Lyndon the Terrible . Actually , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Hey , look who 's here ! " She greeted Norton with a noisy kiss . " Everybody , this is Ben , " she announced . " Ben , these are " ? she started pointing to the upturned faces ? " Annie , who just had her first story bought by Cosmo , and Tim , who 's in legalization , and Mitzi , who 's with the Post , and Mike , who writes for Rolling Stone , and . . . What 's your name , darling ? " " Joe , " a bearded boy replied . " Joe , " she repeated . " And Pete , who I think you know , and ? Oh , hell , introduce yourselves . Ben 's a lawyer and a dear sweet man . " Most of the kids smiled or waved a greeting , except one fellow in the corner who seemed to stick out his tongue . Norton looked again and saw that the boy was busy rolling joints . " Come on down to the kitchen and we 'll get you a drink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I talked to that detective , " she said . " He 's tough , like you said . But all I told him is what I told you I would . " " Gwen , listen , forget about the detective . Forget about everything . It 's all over . " " What do you mean ? " " I got word , on a confidential basis , that they 're about to make an arrest . It was that kid in the liquor store . He followed her home or something like that . He had a record of sex offenses . He was a nut . "  | " Did Kravitz tell you ? " " No , somebody else did . I talked to Kravitz . He would n't confirm it , because there has n't been an arrest yet , but he confirmed that the kid 's under investigation , and it 's pretty clear what 's happening . So just do n't think about it any more . We 've got to put it behind us . It 's out of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shuddered . " Thank God , " she said . " I thought that other  --  the thing we talked about  --  was going to drive me crazy . " " So did I , Gwen . Let 's just forget it now . " " Okay . But Ben , there 's one thing I ought to tell you . " " What ? " " Well , some of those things we talked about  --  about her and Whitmore  --  she could have been exaggerating . Or I might have misunderstood her . You never know about things like that . But I guess it does n't matter now . " Norton did n't understand , but he was n't sure he wanted to understand , so he busied himself mixing a drink . " One other thing , Ben . I ran into Phil Ross in the Door Store today and asked him to drop by tonight . I hope it 's all right . I mean , was n't there some problem between you two ? " Norton stared at her , trying to remember if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No problem , " he said . " Gwen , I 've got no problems with anybody . I 'm starting over . Let 's enjoy ourselves . Come on , let 's go meet your friends . Who are they , anyway ? " They started back to the library . " Most of them are friends of Annie , " Gwen said . " I want you to , meet her . She 's a sweetheart . A good writer too . Worked for the Post for a while but quit to free-lance . She 's done articles for Stone and the Washingtonian , but what she really wants to do is fiction . And she just sold her first short story , so that 's why the party . " Back in the library Norton sat down on the sofa beside Annie , who was a tall thin young woman with freckles and long unruly black hair . She was wearing jeans and a flowered blouse open at least two buttons farther down than her mother  | would have approved . Her breasts were small and jaunty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're Annie , " he said . " That 's right . " " I 'm Ben Norton . " " I know . Gwen told me . You went with her friend Donna , the one who was killed . " " That 's right . " " Tell me about her . " " I do n't want to tell you about her . " " Okay , I 'm sorry . I just . . . It sounded like a hell of a story . " " She 's dead , " he said . " The story 's over . " " Hey , Annie , " another girl called from across the room . " Did you hear about Sophie ? " Sophie was a Congresswoman , age forty-five or so , who was noted both for her outspoken views and her ample girth . " No , what about her ? " Annie called back . " She 's pregnant , " the other girl , Mitzi , cried . " Oh , God , can you imagine Sophie in bed with that tiny little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the boy who had been rolling joints began a long complicated story , the gist of which was that the Speaker of the House was a shoe fetishist . " You people do n't think much of our elected leaders , do you ? " Norton said . " Should we ? " Annie said . " I mean , if you forget what they say and just watch what they do , it 's ridiculous . I mean , Congress is like the monkey house at the zoo . If they moved the monkeys to Congress and the Congressmen to the zoo , it would n't make any difference . Or am I getting too radical for you ? " Norton shrugged . " There are plenty of clowns up there , " he said . " But there are some good people too . " " Tell me about Whitmore , " she said abruptly . " Is he a good person ? "  | " I would n't accuse him of that , " Norton said . " But he might be a great President . Politically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about . " " But what 's he like as a person ? " " I do n't know . I never think of him as a person . " " Women do , " she said . " He 's awfully attractive . " " He 's old enough to be your father . " " I had an affair with a man his age once . A really neat man , all craggy-looking , sort of like Humphrey Bogart . " " Do you have a lot of affairs ? " " I do n't know what 's a lot . I 'm twenty-seven and I 've slept with twenty-three men . Is that a lot ? How many women have you slept with ? " " I do n't know , " he said . " I 've lost count . " " Seriously , give me a number . " " Oh , hell , too many . Fifty . A hundred . I was into numbers for a few years . It was ridiculous . " " Why are n't you married ? " she asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am the type , but the ones I wanted to marry did n't want to marry me , and vice versa . I 'm too cautious . I look at all my old school friends and they 're all divorced , or want to be , or should be . It does n't make you want to rush headlong into marriage . " " That 's the one thing I wo n't do , " Annie said . " Have affairs with married men . I did it a couple of times but no more . " " Why ? Does it make you feel guilty ? " " No . But it hurts too much . To make love with someone and then have him get up and leave and go spend the night with someone else . You do n't know what that 's like . " A joint made its way to them . Norton passed it on to her . " Do n't you smoke ? " she asked . " Sometimes . Not much . I always forget the ends of my sentences . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll loosen you up . " He took a hit , annoyed . Women were always telling him he  | looked stiff , formal , reserved . Hell , he could n't help how he looked . What 'd they want him to do , go barefoot ? " You know what you look like ? " she said . " You look like you ought to be wearing a white suit and sitting on the front porch of your plantation with a mint julep in your hand . " " Sort of like Clark Gable , " he said . " Maybe more like Colonel Sanders . " She giggled . " But sort of the old Southern aristocracy . Heir to a proud tradition and all that . " " Annie , do you want to know how it was ? " he said . " How it was , according to my father , was that in 1820 to celebrate the Queen 's birthday they freed all the prisoners in London , on the condition they get out of the country , and all those worthless bastards stole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way to America , and that 's how the Norton clan got here . And the family tree produced a lot of horse thieves and hundreds of Confederate soldiers and one pretty good governor of North Carolina and eventually my father , who lost his farm in 1934 and went to work in a lumber mill for twenty cents an hour and glad to get it . And I 'd have been working in the lumber mill too except that , number one , I was pretty bright , and number two , and far more important , I had a talent for knocking hell out of a baseball , which clearly marked me as a man destined for great things . " " How 'd you happen to work for Whitmore ? " she asked . " I thought he was famous for hiring ruthless sons of bitches . " " Well , he thought he needed one hayseed around to soften his image , " Norton said , laughing at his own joke . " No , it was more complicated than that . I came up to work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anti-trust and monopolies subcommittee . When my Senator died , Whitmore took over as chairman of the subcommittee . After a decent interval , he called me into his office one day . I figured he was going to fire me and put in one of his own people . Instead , we had this very brief conversation . He said , You want to keep your job , Norton ? ' I said I did . He said , It 's yours . All I ask is loyalty .  | One thousand percent . ' I said that was no problem . We shook hands and that was that . Except that when I got my next paycheck I found out he 'd given me a raise . " " You underestimated him , " Annie said . " You were doing a good job and he was too smart to fire you . " " You 're right , " Norton said . " It was the last time I ever underestimated Chuck Whitmore . Eventually he made me his legislative assistant . And here I am . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hair , and just then they were joined by Pete , the bartender from Nathan 's . " Hey , Mr. Norton , how 's it going ? " " No complaints.You know Annie ? " " Sure . Mr. Norton , I do n't wanta interrupt , but I have got one hell of a problem . Hey , have a hit . " He grinned and held out a huge joint . Norton took a puff and handed it to Annie . " The thing is , " Pete continued , " I borrowed this guy 's car last week and I got stopped for running a stop sign and they found six ounces of grass under the seat and they 're charging me with possession with intent to distribute . Man , I did n't even know it was there . " " When are you due in court ? " Norton asked . " Two weeks from Monday . " " Drop by my office next week and we 'll talk about it . " " Man , that 'd be great . But I ai @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pete . " " Thanks , Mr. Norton . " Pete got up and started to leave . " Say , Pete , " Norton said , " do you remember a couple of weeks ago you said some guy had been in the bar asking questions about me ? What 'd he look like ? " Pete grimaced and began to tug at his beard . " You know , I do n't exactly remember , " he said . " You said he was weird-looking . " " Did I ? Did I say that ? Well , maybe he was . Or maybe it was some other guy . I might have been stoned . Hey , I 'll see you next week , okay ? " Pete hurried from the room . " What was that all about ? " Annie asked .  | " I 'm not sure . " " He 's a dealer , you know . " " I know . But the drug laws are stupid and there 's no use him going to jail for selling grass . " " Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try to . My law firm represents some of the fattest cats in America , so it 's good for my soul to help some poor bastard out now and then . " " I like you , " she said . " I like you too . You 're honest . " " People ought to be honest , " she said . " I mean , you ca n't help it if you 're not pretty or not smart , but anybody can be honest if they want to . " He thought suddenly of Donna , who was the most honest person he 'd ever known , so honest , perhaps , that it had killed her , and he wanted to get crazy college-boy drunk , drunk enough to forget about her for a while . But getting drunk was n't the answer to anything , and instead he squeezed Annie 's hand and tried to concentrate on her . She was a nice person , bright and pretty and independent and honest , a little like Donna , but a few years younger and a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter ? " she asked . " There 's not much to tell . I write magazine articles to make money and short stories to . . . well , because it 's a challenge . " " What do you want to do ? " " Write a novel . But I 'm not ready yet . " " Gwen said you 'd left the Post . Why 'd you do that ? 1 thought everybody was dying to work for the Post . " " So was I , until I 'd done it for a year . It was like working in " Nothing . I may be a little stoned . Tell me about your writing . " a factory . A nice factory , with some nice people , turning out a good product , but still a factory . I mean , some people worked downstairs on the printing presses and some of us worked  | upstairs at our typewriters . Free-lancing , I make half the money and have twice the fun . Oh , my God , where did he come from ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He started to get up , then decided against it . " Phil . Meet Annie . You 're both distinguished writers . Pull up a drink and join us . " Ross shook his head impatiently . " I 'm not staying , Ben . Gwen did n't tell me what kind of a party it was . But I 'm glad to see you . I wanted to tell you that Ed Murphy and I compared notes about that . . . misunderstanding we had . " He glanced at Annie . " It 's okay , " Norton said . " Well , " Ross said , " on the day in question he was riding down Wisconsin Avenue , and with a White House secretary who happens to look a great deal like your friend . So , end of mystery . " " That 's great , Phil , " Norton said . " Damn fine . Listen , that was a great column you had this morning . " The columnist beamed . " It did make some news , " he said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Do n't dash off , " Norton said . " Stay and meet the younger generation . " Ross frowned . " Frankly , I do n't like being places where marijuana is smoked . It is illegal , you know . " " That 's true , " Norton said . " Dirty business . " " Well , so long , " the columnist said and hurried out the door . " That fool , " Annie whispered . " He wrote columns supporting Nixon until the day he resigned , and he talks about grass being illegal . What was that about him and Ed Murphy ? " " Nothing . Except that Ross had a column this morning that was a leak from somebody very close to the top , which means that he and Ed Murphy are pretty good buddies these days . Tell me about your girlhood . Did you play baseball ? " " No , I wrote poetry . And about the time your father was  | losing his farm , mine was starting a grocery store in the Bronx that eventually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Lord taketh away , " Norton said . " Were you happy ? " " Miserable . I was so damn skinny . Still am . " " The nearer the bone , the sweeter the meat . " " The what ? " " An old Southern expression . " " It sounds dirty . " " It is . It means I like the way you 're put together . " " I like the way you 're put together too . " " I 'm mighty pleased to hear that , ma'am . But right this minute , if you 'll kindly excuse me , I 've got to go pee . " " Will you come back ? " " I 'll try . " He floated down the hallway to the bathroom , but its door was locked and someone was groaning inside . " What 's wrong ? " Norton asked . " I 'm throwing up , " a young man said . Norton thought he recognized the voice of the fellow who 'd been rolling joints all night . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Norton wandered out the back door . He crossed the shadowy lawn and relieved himself beneath a huge oak tree , looking up at the stars and feeling in tune with the universe . He stood there for a while listening to the music and laughter from inside , and then he noticed someone come around the corner of the house and crouch in the flowerbeds outside the library window . Norton watched the dark figure for a moment , bemused at first , and then he thought of the window peeper who had killed Donna and he began to run forward . " Hey , get out of there , " he yelled . The man at the window jumped up and began to race across the lawn . He was wearing a dark suit and seemed slender and wiry . Norton chased him across the lawn , gaining on him at first , and when he was five feet behind the man he dived at him , the way football heroes and movie stars do , floating  | through the air for a long time , almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dewy grass . Up the street , he heard a car roar away . Norton had gotten only a glimpse of the man , but he was sure he 'd seen him recently . But where ? In Georgetown ? In Palm Springs ? At the White House ? He was n't sure , and it did n't seem to matter . He thought of a scrap of poetry : " Down in lovely muck I 've lain / Happy till I woke again . " Then he dropped off to sleep . He might have slept a long time if Annie had not come out and wakened him .  | 15 NORTON AWOKE in his own bed , not entirely sure how he 'd gotten there but feeling fine . He threw open his bedroom window and breathed the sweet spring air . Then he plopped down on the floor and did fifteen pushups . It was a time for new starts . He took a long shower and thought of all the things he would do in the weeks ahead . He would go on a diet and start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whit Stone about his new assignment , he would set aside evenings for research and writing , and he would check with the local law schools about lecturing on corporate law . And Annie . She floated back to him , tall and tomboy thin , all freckles and unruly hair , and he decided he would call her for dinner . But no more reefer madness . That was over , all the madness was over now , and he would think only of the future . He dressed , had only a cup of black coffee for breakfast ? the new diet had begun  --  and bounded out the door to walk to work . It was a fresh , windy morning . Rain had fallen over-  | night and the sidewalks were still wet , but the clouds were gone and the sky was a dazzling blue . As he passed the Biograph Theater , a pale girl in a granny dress asked him if he 'd talked to Jesus lately . Norton 's last conversation with Jesus had been some twenty years before , but the girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ played with in his youth and he handed her some bills that were loose in his pocket . " God bless , God bless , " she cried as he moved on down M Street , and he smiled at the benediction . A block before he reached his office , Norton saw Gabriel Pincus coming toward him . He watched Gabe for a minute . Other pedestrians were smiling , whistling , enjoying the lovely morning , but Gabe picked his way down the street like a soldier moving through a minefield , his eyes darting from face to face as if some assassin lay in ambush for him . He was a pudgy , balding , disheveled man of thirty-five who was arguably the best investigative reporter in the world . When Gabe saw Norton , he fell in beside him without any greeting and whispered , " When 'd you get back ? " His tone somehow suggested that Norton had been a fugitive from justice . " About two weeks ago , Gabe . How 've you been ? I saw where you got the Pulitzer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Gabe said . " You still working for Whit Stone ? " Yep . " I want to talk to you , " he said . " I 'm onto something big . " " What is it this time , Gabe ? " One of Norton 's law partners fell in beside them and nodded a good morning . " Ca n't talk now , " Gabe said . " I 'll call you later . " Then , with a final glance over his shoulder , he disappeared around the corner . Norton was not sorry to see Gabe go . Gabe was a great reporter , but he could be a royal pain in the ass . He lived in a world of plots and conspiracies , and because the real world had in recent years often approximated Gabe 's most terrible  | fantasies he had become a celebrated journalist . But Norton wanted no more of fantasies and conspiracies . That was all behind him now , and he reminded himself to tell his secretary he would not be in if Mr. Pincus called . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , took the elevator to the third floor , and pushed through the big oak door with " Goggins , Copeland &; Stone " inscribed on a plaque of burnished gold . He winked at Josie , the new receptionist , marched down the hallway to his office , and began sorting through his mail . There were letters from clients , one perfumed letter postmarked Paris , some bills that had finally caught up with him , something from the Sierra Club , a bulletin from the Duke Alumni Council , an invitation to a fundraising reception for a North Carolina Senator , and finally a letter in a plain white envelope with his name and address handwritten in an elaborate old-fashioned scroll . The letter had a Washington postmark and no return address . Norton frowned at the small mystery and tore open the envelope . The note inside was brief . " Demand to see the autopsy report , " it said . " Do not give up . You are not alone . " And it was signed , " A friend . " Norton read the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? What about the autopsy ? What more could it add ? Who had sent this note ? He decided it had to be a joke , a bad joke . One of Gwen 's , perhaps . Or some madman . Or some enemy he 'd made somewhere along the line . The police knew how she 'd died and they 'd found the killer  --  what more could the autopsy say ? He started to throw the note away and forget about it , but he could n't . Something told him this was no joke . He felt the morning 's optimism crumbling and all his old uncertainty returning as he reached for the phone to call Sergeant Kravitz . Kravitz was discussing the case with Frank Kifner , the young U.S. Attorney , and it was n't going well .  | " If you need men , Joe , we 'll get you men , " Kifner said . They were in his office , which was large and austere . Kifner himself was small and austere . And , Kravitz thought , a prick . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overtime , priority clearance from me , it 's all yours for the asking . No problem . But let 's wrap this one up . " " They 're either quick or they 're slow , Frank . This one 's slow . This one takes shoe leather . And luck . Eventually somebody will talk . We 're pushing like hell . But it could take time . " Kifner frowned and fiddled with an unlit pipe . He was a precise little man with colorless hair and rimless glasses . " What about the kid ? " Kifner said . " I think there 's something there , right before our eyes . " Kravitz suppressed a groan . He 'd never seen Kifner like this before . There was pressure on this one , but Kravitz could n't figure out where from . " Joey admits seeing her . Period . He left the liquor store at eight and his mother says he got home for dinner at eight thirty and watched television with her till midnight . " " She 'd lie for him . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jury too . She 's a sweet little lady who teaches Sunday school . If Joey did this , we 're gon na have to put him there , hard and fast . " " He 's a sex criminal . " " He 's a kid who blew his brains out on acid and spent some time at St. Elizabeth 's and discovered the joy of sex there . You know , in broom closets , under beds , behind the bushes , group therapy they call it . So when he 's released he gets deep into window peeping , and the worst thing he ever did was grab a girl in Montrose Park and try to go down on her . But he did n't try too hard because when she got loose and ran away he just laid down on the grass and went to sleep . Which does not make him a violent sex criminal . " " So you do n't think Joey did it ? " " The mother could be lying . He could have gone by the house and talked his way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We do n't have any evidence for it , but it 's possible . The thing that turns me off is the fingerprints . Or the absence thereof . Somebody wiped off every last fingerprint in that house , and Joey 's just not up to that kind of effort . It 's all he can do to tie both shoelaces . " " Just keep after Joey , " Kifner said . " He could have handled those prints . He could have learned that much on television . What about the others ? " " The paperboy looks like a dead end . We 're still looking for the maid 's son . We 're watching the guy at the service station . The actor 's story holds up . He was at a dinner party in Los Angeles that night . And then there 's Norton . He called me yesterday . Said he 'd heard that Joey was about to be arrested . " Kifner kept fiddling with his pipe . " What do you make of that ? " " I do n't know , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conscience and hopes we 've got the case locked up . I ca n't figure the guy out . There 's that phone call he claims to have gotten the morning we found her , the one that sent him roaring over to Georgetown . " " What 's your theory on that one ? " Kifner asked . Kravitz grimaced with frustration . " Either he 's lying or he 's telling the truth . If he 's lying , if there was n't any phone call , then I figure he killed the girl , then got this crazy idea that it 'd make him look innocent if he came over and identified her for us . I do n't know . I can imagine the guy clipping his ex-girl friend on the jaw , but it 's hard to think he 'd be dumb enough to come back to the scene like that . " " What if somebody did call him ? " the U.S. Attorney asked . " Then whoever killed her was trying to set him up , " Kravitz said . " Which would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if the killer was somebody who knew her , and knew Norton had just arrived back in town . . . " " He would n't have had to know her , " Kifner said . " Joey could have talked his way inside the house . Or somebody else . And then talked to the woman for a while . And she mentions  | that her old boy friend is due back in town . Then she gets killed . Then the killer gets the idea of the call to Norton , to suck him in . " Kravitz cursed under his breath and lit another cigarette . " You know Norton , " he said . " What about him ? Could he have done it ? " Kifner stared at the ceiling for a while before answering . " Ben 's not the violent type , " he said at last . " He 's big , but he 's easygoing . On the other hand , who knows ? He comes back from Europe . He 's exhausted from his flight . He goes to a bar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then he sees his ex-girl friend on the street . Remember , we 've got him leaving Nathan 's at approximately the same time she 's leaving the liquor store across the street . So he might well have seen her . She invites him back to the house . Or he follows her back . They argue . He slugs her . It 's possible . " The U.S. Attorney looked at his watch and stood up . " Keep pushing , Joe , " he said . " This case is important . I know you want to be the next chief of detectives . I 'd like to put in a few words for you . But mostly you 've got to do it yourself , and this case is the one that can do it . " The detective started for the door , then turned back . " Norton 's coming to see me this morning , " he said . " Any special ideas ? " " Lean on him , " Frank Kifner told him . " Lean on everybody , until somebody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eleven thirty . The place still stank of cigars and stale coffee . They sat down across an empty desk in the back of the room and Norton was about to ask about the autopsy when Kravitz beat him to the punch . " You have n't been leveling with me , Mr. Norton . " " What do you mean ? " " I talked to Ross , the newspaper columnist . Why did n't you  | tell me he 'd said he 'd seen Miss Hendricks with Ed Murphy ? " " Murphy denied it . Ross changed his story . So I assumed he 'd made a mistake . " " Mr. Norton , I 'd advise you not to assume anything . You know what it means to withhold information . " " You 're right . I should have mentioned it . " " What about your little junket to California ? Should you have mentioned that ? Or did you assume I would n't be in-terested ? " " I do n't have to tell you every move I make , Sergeant . I went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ owning that house , I wanted to question him about it . We talked briefly . He said she asked to use the house and he let her . He claimed not to know why she was coming to Washington . That was about it . " " What about Carmel ? " " I talked to Harry Nolan , an old Senator who lived down the road from Donna . He did n't have a lot to say . " No , not a lot . . . except the small detail that the President-elect had visited Donna in Carmel a few days before he 'd been sworn into office . Norton had checked the papers for that week . Officially , Whitmore had gone sailing off the California coast with one of his millionaire friends . But Kravitz was going to have to figure that one out for himself . " Sergeant , could I ask you a couple of questions ? " " Go ahead . " " Are n't you about to wrap this up ? I realize you ca n't say anything officially , but my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the liquor store . " " Mr. Norton , I do n't know where you 're getting your information , but my advice to you is do n't hold your breath until that boy is arrested . " Norton was confused . Either Whit Stone had bad information or Kravitz was lying . " What do you have on the boy , Sergeant ? "  | " I 'm not going to get into the evidence , Mr. Norton . Do you have any other questions ? " Norton hesitated . He 'd almost forgotten why he came . The whole damn thing was too confusing . He was sorry he 'd let himself get involved again , all because of some crank letter . " Yes , Sergeant . I wonder if I could see a copy of the autopsy . " " Why ? " " Just curiosity . Do you have a copy ? " " No , " Kravitz lied . " But I can tell you the highlights . You know how she died . The impact of her head hitting the coffee table . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or other sexual activity indicated . She was in excellent health . There was really only one unusual fact disclosed by the autopsy , Mr. Norton . " Norton saw that he was being set up ; he wondered what was coming . " What was that , Sergeant ? " " Miss Hendricks was three months pregnant . " Once , playing baseball , Norton had taken his eyes off the game to wink at a cheerleader and for his trouble he 'd been hit between the eyes by a line drive . That was how he felt now . It came out of nowhere , caught him between the eyes , and left him stunned , helpless . Donna , three months pregnant . That meant mid-January and that meant Whitmore and that changed everything . The bastard had gotten her pregnant and she 'd come to Washington to see him and . . . " You look surprised , Mr. Norton . " " Of course I 'm surprised . " " Any idea who the man might be ? " " No . " " Mr. Norton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you level with me ? If you really cared about her , why do n't you help me find out who killed her ? " Norton wanted to . He wanted to tell Kravitz everything . That damned Whitmore had gotten her pregnant and then  | washed his hands of her and if he had n't killed her himself he knew who had . Or so part of him believed . But another part was n't convinced and still could not make that accusation against the President . Norton thought of the old Senator , Harry Nolan . If the police talked to him , and he told them about the meeting in January , that would start them moving in the right direction . Norton hoped they would . He did n't give a damn about protecting Whitmore . To hell with Whitmore . He did n't care if Whitmore was run out of town on a rail . He just did n't want the responsibility of having destroyed a President , not unless he was sure . " Have you talked to Senator Nolan ? " he said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know who had visited her out there in January , if that 's when she got pregnant . " " He 's been away , " Kravitz said . " We just contacted him last night . A man 's going to question him this morning . " " Good , " Norton said . " Would you excuse me , Sergeant ? I . . . I do n't feel very good . " Kravitz dismissed him with a shrug . Norton stumbled out the door , past two weeping black women in the corridor , and down the elevator to the lobby . It was all sinking in , all coming clear at last . That son of a bitch Whitmore , that dirty son of a bitch . Norton vowed to get to the bottom of this . And he was n't going to count on the police to do it for him . He needed help , but not from the police . He had a better idea . He found a pay phone and called the Washington bureau of the Chicago World . Gabe Pincus told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WASHINGTON BUREAU of the Chicago World possessed a quiet elegance more often seen in legal offices than newspaper offices . As a polite young black receptionist led Norton to Gabe Pincus 's desk  --  for you did n't just barge into the World bureau  --  it seemed that the only inelegant thing in the newsroom was Gabe himself . The other desks were neat and their occupants genteelly clad , but Gabe 's desk looked like a garbage heap and Gabe looked right at home amid the debris . His tie was unfashionably narrow and his shirt collar was badly frayed . His old tweed coat was torn at the shoulder , his khaki pants were stained with what Norton hoped was red paint , and Gabe 's right shoe had come loose from its sole , so that his toes showed through . And lest any passerby overlook his toes , Gabe had propped his feet atop his typewriter as he carried on a loud one-sided telephone conversation : " Look , Mr. Secretary , why do n't you knock off the horse-  | shit and answer my questions ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going with this story and you better get on the record fast if you want to save your ass . Okay , then to hell with you ! " Gabe slammed down the phone and winked at Norton . " Let the bastard squirm , " he said . " Hey , Sans Souci okay for lunch ? " " Can we get in ? " " The last of the big tippers can get in anywhere . These bastards wo n't pay me what I 'm worth , so I make up the difference on my expense account . After the Harrigan trial I took the whole lousy jury to lunch . It cost the World eight hundred dollars , but it was worth it . If those bastards had n't convicted Harrigan it would have cost us twenty million in libel suits . " The elderly gentleman at the next typewriter , who was clad in a well-worn Brooks Brothers suit and looked rather like a stockbroker , shut his eyes and crossed himself . Gabe ignored him and led Norton out of the newsroom . Near the front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ English suit stepped out of a private office , took one look at Gabe , and jumped back inside . Gabe winked at Norton and pointed to his exposed toes . " The toes drive Mr. Best Dressed up the wall , " he said . " Oh , would that jerk like to fire me , but he 's just smart enough to know the paper needs me more than it needs him . " At Sans Souci the maitre d ' greeted Gabe with an enthusiasm usually reserved for visiting heads of state . However , when he offered them a choice table near the center of the dining room , Gabe shook his head and insisted on another table against the wall . As they crossed the room , various political figures looked at Gabe and waved , frowned , avoided his glance or , in the case of one Assistant Attorney General , got up and left . A young French waiter asked if they 'd like drinks . " A Bloody Mary for me , " Norton said .  | " Good idea , " Gabe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trip . " When the waiter had gone , Gabe picked up the bowl of flowers on the table and examined it , then got down on his knees and peered under the table . " Got to watch out for bugs , " he explained in a whisper . " I never take the table they offer me , but they might bug all of them . Do n't talk when the waiter 's around . And do n't talk loud enough for anybody at the next table to hear . " Norton glanced furtively at the next table , where two elderly ladies were chatting innocently . The waiter returned with the four Bloody Marys , and a moment later a small wavyhaired man came over and engaged Gabe in several minutes of small talk . " That little prick , " Gabe said after the man had returned to his own table . " Who is he ? " " Jerry Vincenti . Do n't you know him ? He used to be in the White House . Now he 's a big-shot lobbyist . " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Jerry Vincenti story . You understand , he 's the biggest ass kisser who ever lived , right ? Well , the story is , one time his beloved President was having some trouble with a guy in his Cabinet named Harper who he thought was too independent . Not a team player . So the President calls Harper in one afternoon and gives him a long lecture on loyalty . But Harper , who was just a halfwit college professor , kept saying that he did n't understand , that he 'd been loyal . So finally the President gets pissed and called in his faithful retainer Jerry Vincenti . " Jerry , ' he says , did I screw your wife before you married her ? ' " Yes sir , Mr. President , ' Jerry says proudly . " Have I been screwing your wife since you married her ? ' " Yes sir , Mr. President , ' Jerry says again , all aglow to be getting this recognition .  | " Whereupon our glorious leader turns to Harper and says , That , Mr. Secretary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gabe grinned and wolfed down his first Bloody Mary . Norton shook his head . " That is a truly incredible story . " " It 's God 's own truth , " Gabe said . " Harper 's mistress told it to me . He was so shook up that he quit the Cabinet , whereupon she quit him . " They chatted casually through their second Bloody Marys . For a time , when Gabe was between marriages , he 'd dated a friend of Donna 's and the four of them had spent a good deal of time together . That was back when Gabe was still on the police beat , before he 'd learned that his relentlessness could be applied to higher levels of government with more spectacular results . Now he wore the scalps of Senators and Cabinet officials on his belt the way other World reporters wore their Phi Beta Kappa keys . Gabe fascinated Norton . He had the looks of a used car salesman and the morals of a safecracker , and yet it was rumored  --  although he violently denied it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his spare time translating the classics . And it was a fact that he and his second wife had adopted a black child and a Vietnamese orphan . When their food arrived  --  veal for Norton , rockfish for Gabe  --  along with a fine bottle of Montrachet , and the waiter had withdrawn , the reporter leaned forward and lowered his voice . " What 's on your mind , pal ? " " Donna . " " I figured . Who do you think did it ? " " I do n't know . It could have been a burglar . I hate to jump into conspiracy theories . " " Why not ? They 're usually true . Why was she in town ? " " I 'm not sure . I heard that she saw Ed Murphy . " " That figures . Look , let 's get down to the short hairs . She was balling Whitmore , right ? " Norton stared at Gabe in amazement . " How did you know ? " The reporter laughed . " I did n't , you dummy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lousy poker player . So what was going on ? " " They had an affair , about the time of the primaries . They apparently broke it off in July , when she went to California . Or maybe they did n't . I had one report that he went to see her in January . " " Quit pussy-footing around , pal . She was pregnant , was n't she ? " " Are you bluffing again , Gabe ? " The reporter shook his head . " I got that from a guy in the coroner 's office . Look , he knocks her up . She comes to town to see him . She wants money or wants him to divorce his wife or whatever . Or maybe he wants her to get an abortion or wants assurances she wo n't shoot her mouth off . They have an argument . Big Chuck 's on the sauce . He whomps her one , she bangs her head on the table , he gets the hell out of there , and we 're back to the old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flushed with excitement . This was his business , to think the unthinkable and then prove it true . " What you say is possible , " Norton said . " I 've tried not to think about it . I do n't say Whitmore 's the most sterling character in the world , but ? " " But what ? " Gabe snapped . " But he 's the President , damn it . He 's trying to do some good things . " " Baloney ! " Gabe Pincus said angrily . " Look , buddy boy , he 's a politician and that means he 's a thug . They 're all thugs , your bunch and the other bunch , and it do n't matter which gang 's in power . The only difference is that one gang is a little bit more generous with other people 's money , and the other gang dresses better . Now , do you want to find out who killed your girl friend or do n't you ? " " I want to , " Norton said . " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " " Sure it could . Or it could have been Ed Murphy who slugged her . Or it could have been some burglar . The first  | thing I 'd like to know is where Whitmore and Murphy were that night . " " It was the night that jobs rally got out of hand , " Norton said . " The official record is that Whitmore never left the White House . " " He could have sneaked out , " Gabe said . " Just climbed into a limousine on East Executive Avenue and sailed off into the night . Nobody pays any attention to all those limousines . Hitler could be in one and nobody would notice . But I 'll check around . Somebody would have noticed  --  one of the guards , a Secret Service guy , somebody . " " Gabe , some strange things have been happening lately . " " Like what ? " " People keep changing their stories . It was Phil Ross who told me he saw Donna and Ed together , then Ed got on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mistake . " " Ross is gutless , " Gabe snapped . " None of your columnists or hot-shot political reporters are going to touch this with a ten-foot pole . They 're the same bunch who were calling Watergate a caper ' when a few of us crazies were risking our careers to dig out the truth . All you 're telling me is that Murphy bought Ross off . Which explains a couple of highpowered leaks he 's got recently . " " Some other people too , " Norton said . " Pete , the bartender at Nathan 's , told me some weird-looking guy was in there checking me out , then he went blank when I followed up on it . And Gwen Bowers told me about the affair , then last night out of nowhere she says she could have been wrong . " Gabe shrugged and signaled the waiter for more wine . " Pete 's a doper , which means they can turn him around easy . And Gwen would n't be so tough either . Celebrities are even easier to buy off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big job . " They sat silently for a moment while the waiter took away their plates . The two elderly women were still at the next  | table . When Gabe saw one of them looking at him , he glared at her until she flushed and turned away . " Things have happened on my job too , " Norton said . " The other day a fellow at Justice did me a favor , but when I kept after Ed Murphy the favor suddenly got undone . " " That was Murphy twisting the knife . " " Probably , " Norton agreed . " But the strangest part was Whit Stone calling me in and instead of being mad he gave me this great new assignment . And it turned out that he knew all about Donna 's death . He even told me that the police were about to arrest a kid who waited on Donna in a liquor store . But today I talked to Kravitz , the detective , who said the kid was a suspect but nowhere near being arrested . So I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Gabe leaned across the table , his eyes bright with excitement . " I 'll tell you what 's going on . You 're getting the royal runaround . You do n't think all this is coincidence , do you ? " " I do n't know , Gabe . " " You know what 's the most interesting thing you 've said ? " " What ? " " The stuff about Whit Stone . " " Why ? " " Because your distinguished boss , that luminary of the American bar , is the biggest crook in Washington . Which is saying one hell of a lot . " Norton was taken aback . " Whit 's slick , but I do n't think he 's any slicker than a dozen other big-name lawyers around town . Sure , he 's helped kill some good legislation ? " " I 'm not talking about legislation . I 'm talking about blackmail . Wiretapping . Laundered money . Big piles of money that get from his corporate cronies to his political cronies with you know who as the middleman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Okay , Gabe , okay . Suppose he 's a crook . What does that have to do with Donna ? "  | " He tried to cool you out , right ? " " I guess so . " " He knew all about the case , right ? " " He knew a lot . " " Why ? What 's a murder case to Whitney Stone ? " " I do n't know , " Norton admitted . Gabe leaned forward with his hands cupped around his Irish coffee . The thick cream atop the coffee had left a faint white mustache on his upper lip . " Do you know what Whit Stone wants most ? " " What ? " " To be Attorney General . " " You 're kidding . " " Kidding hell . That nitwit who 's in there now wo n't last out the year and Stone wants to replace him . He can buy enough ! II votes to get through the Senate . His problem is persuading Whitmore to nominate him and take the heat from the four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So right now he 's looking for favors he can do the White House , and cooling you out might be a pretty big favor right now . " 11 It was almost three and the restaurant was nearly empty . Waiters hovered near the table and Gabe eyed them suspiciously . " Listen , Norton , this game could get tough , " he whispered . " So far , they 've just tried to buy you off , but Whit Stone could fire you and Ed Murphy could fix it so no law firm in Washington would let you in the door . Are you in this to stay ? " " All the way , Gabe . That 's why I 'm here . Between the two of us , we can break this thing . " Gabe chewed on a matchstick for a moment , staring at Norton as if trying to make up his mind about something . " Okay , " he said finally , " I 'm gon na level with you . And I mean in confidence . You may not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me 1 ' 11 really ruin you . " " You can trust me , Gabe . " " Look , I 'll try to find out who zapped Donna , but what  | really interests me about this is Whit Stone sticking his nose into it . I 'm after that bastard , and you can give me some help . " " What kind of help ? " " You understand , this is confidential . " " Gabe , do you want it in blood ? " " Do Washington lawyers have blood ? " Gabe shot back . Then he leaned across the table and cupped his hands around his mouth , as if to frustrate unseen lip readers . " Norton , " he whispered , " have you ever heard of the Hoover file ? " " The Hoover file ? No . " " Do I have to explain ? " " Maybe you 'd better . " " Okay . There 's been a rumor for a long time that when the old man died he left behind his own personal file . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You wanta know where Lyndon got his money ? You wanta know if Tricky and Bebe played drop the soap ? You wanta know what Jackie was doing all those weekends they said she was fox hunting ? You wanta know what distinguished Senator seduces the Senate page boys ? And that 's just the fun and games stuff . There 's stuff in that file that could tear this country apart . " " Like what ? " " Like who killed Kennedy . " " Which Kennedy ? " " Take your pick . Listen , if Hoover did n't do it he knew who did . It 's all in the file , pal . I know one guy who 's got a standing offer of a million bucks cash for it , no questions asked . And that 's just where the bidding starts . " Norton stared at Gabe intently . There was a glint in the reporter 's eyes that reminded Norton of Bogart 's Fred C. Dobbs as he pursued the treasure of Sierra Madre . If Norton had only now met Gabe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insane . But in fact Gabe was a prize-winning journalist , and arguably was in as close touch with political reality as any man in America .  | " Is this for real , Gabe ? " he asked . " Or just another crazy Washington rumor ? " " There was only one guy in the world Hoover trusted , " Gabe said . " His buddy Zeke McGuire . So a couple of months ago I talked my way into Zeke 's hospital room and ran the nurses out and stuck my face right up into his and said , Zeke , you know you 're about to croak , right ? But I 'm gon na give you an opportunity few men get . I 'm gon na let you write your own obit . ' Zeke kinda blinked like he was interested , so I said , Zeke , your obit could go two ways . It could talk about forty years of public service , the kind of stuff a fellow 'd want on the front page of the World when he kicked off . Or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two paychecks for the last twenty years and the little one came from the government and the big one from the mob . ' Well , old Zeke turns purple and finally he gasps out , What do you want ? ' and I shot right back , The Hoover file . ' " Son of a bitch , you should have seen him . He starts shaking and sweating and I thought he was gon na croak right there . I had him scared , but he was still afraid of the Chief too , scared old J. Edgar was gon na swoop down from the Big File Cabinet in the Sky and cut his pecker off if he gave me that file . So I pushed him . Zeke , ' I said , I 've got the goods on you . Checks , letters , memos , and I 'll print ' em all unless you get me that file . You 'll go down in history as a bigger crook than Grant and Harding and Nixon put together . ' So Zeke starts writhing around and drooling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out : Whit Stone . ' That 's all . Two words . Then he lets out a groan and flops back on the pillow and the nurses run in and I split . Two hours later old Zeke was dead . The poor bastard . He was n't a bad guy when you got to know him . " " So you never printed the checks and letters ? " Norton asked . " Oh , hell , man , I was bluffing . I went in with some rumors and came out with a lead  --  Whit Stone may have the Hoover  | file , or at least know where it is . I figure he wants to trade it to Whitmore for the Attorney Generalship . " Norton finished his Irish coffee . They were the only customers left in the restaurant , except for two men in blue suits who were sitting at a table by the door . " But why would Whit Stone have the Hoover file ? " Norton demanded . " If there is a Hoover file . " " Because the son @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If I made a list of the ten rottenest bastards in Washington , he 'd be the only private citizen on the list . The others got sent here by their constituents to rip people off , but Stone does it for fun , because he likes it . Listen , pal , some of us are trying to save this country , and it 's bastards like him we 're trying to save it from ! " " Look , Gabe , what 's the bottom line ? What do you want me to do for you ? " " I want you to get me inside Stone 's office , " Gabe whispered . " There 's a chance he keeps the Hoover file in his office safe . " " Gabe , what you 're talking about is sometimes known as burglary . " " Do n't give me that stuff ! " Gabe snapped . " This is the scum of the earth we 're dealing with . They lie , they steal , they make wars nobody wants , and then they go to church on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you wanta know who killed your girl friend or not ? Believe me , whoever 's got the Hoover file knows who killed her . It 's all part of the same ball of wax . So are you with me or not ? " " I 'm with you , " Norton said . " What 's next ? " " Just hang loose till I call you . Play it cool with Whit Stone and Ed Murphy . Let them think you 're playing their game . But keep your eyes open . If there 's any more of those strange coincidences , ' let me know . " Gabe waved the waiter over and got the check . It came to fifty-five dollars . Gabe added a twenty-dollar tip and asked for a receipt .  | " There was one thing I forgot to tell you , " Norton said . " What 's that ? " " I went to Carmel and talked to this old Senator , Harry Nolan , who 'd been a friend of Donna 's there . He told me Whitmore visited her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which point he celebrated by knocking her up . " " The point is , I never told the police about that . But Kravitz said they 're sending a guy to see him today and if he tells them about Whitmore going there , this thing may start unraveling fast . " Gabe chewed on his lower lip . " I do n't think he 'll be telling them , " he said slowly . " What do you mean ? " " Hold on a minute , " Gabe said and waved for one of the waiters . " Run down to the corner and get me the latest edition of the Star , " Gabe commanded , and the waiter dashed for the door . " What 's this all about ? " Norton asked . " Just wait , " Gabe said . " See those two guys by the door ? " " What about them ? " " They 're tailing me . What an assignment . They get to eat at the best restaurants every day at the taxpayers ' expense . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him a dollar and began to thumb through it . " Yeah , here it is , " he said finally . " I thought I saw something on the wire this morning but I wanted to make sure . " He handed the paper across to Norton . It was open to the obituary page . Norton first saw a photograph of a familiar face , then the headline beneath it : " Ex-Senator Nolan Killed in Fall . Served in 1933-53 . " Oh my God , " Norton whispered . " I guess you 'd call that another strange coincidence , ' " Gabe Pincus said , then he belched and started out the door .  | 17 As HOME MOVIES WENT , it was a masterpiece : First you saw Senator Donovan Ripley enter the grubby little apartment , flash his famous grin at Wendy , then paw her for a minute . She broke free , lowered the shade , and the two of them quickly disrobed , jumped into the big brass bed , and immediately went at it . And at it and at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonder when they 'd stop . " You 've got to hand it to the bastard , " he muttered as Senator Ripley 's acrobatics filled the movie screen before him . " He 's a real man . " " He 's a pounder , " Wendy said . " Bam-bam-bam , all night long . No finesse whatsoever . " The Wendy who was watching the film with Riddle was clad in her usual jeans and sweater , but the Wendy up on the screen was wearing only a black mask . The mask had been her own idea . She hoped to conceal her identity and thus be spared any unpleasantries that might arise from this rather  | unusual film in which she was , as she saw it , co-starring . She had persuaded the Senator that wearing a mask during sex was her ultimate turn-on . And the Senator was easily persuaded . He was a good-natured , rather dim-witted fellow in his early forties who a clever young woman could persuade of almost anything . The people who hoped to make him President knew this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clever young women . But they had reckoned without Byron Riddle . Finding Wendy had been the first , and easiest , job . A pro would n't do for this mission , for Ripley liked his women young and virginal-looking . So Riddle had wandered about local campuses , one evening dropping into a meeting of a group called the Defenders of American Freedom , and there he had found Wendy , outlining an Impeach Byron White campaign . Afterwards , he took her for coffee , introducing himself as Dr. Horatio Green , a behavioral scientist by profession and a Constitutionalist in politics . Wendy loved to talk politics , and it developed that she loathed Donovan Ripley ? " I 'd do anything to keep him from being President , " she had said  --  and thus was Operation Red Eye born . The next , and greater , challenge was to penetrate the wall of security around Ripley . The only thing Senator Ripley loved more than serving his fellow man was screwing his fellow man 's wife , daughter , sister , or mother . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entrapment , blackmail , or scandal , and he chose his partners with extreme care . He staffed his Senate office with young women whose loyalties were beyond question , often the daughters of his political advisers . When Riddle had sent Wendy around for a job interview , she 'd barely gotten in the door . But then Riddle had an inspiration . He got Wendy a job in the Senate office next door to Ripley 's , and counted on Ripley 's roving eye to do the rest . It did . Within a week he had winked at Wendy in the hallway , the next week he called her in for a little get-acquainted chat , and it was the next evening that he made his film debut .  | Up on the screen both the film and the Senator were nearing a climax . The red-faced Senator and the masked Wendy bounded this way and that , twisting , turning , flipping about like sex-crazed acrobats , until finally Ripley let out a whoop of delight and collapsed , limp and sweaty , in Wendy 's arms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was sore for a week . " " You were great , " Riddle told her . Up on the screen , the Senator glanced at his watch , disengaged himself from the masked woman , quickly dressed , and with a jaunty wave was gone . " Damn fine , " Riddle said . " Quality stuff . " " Will you pay me now ? " Wendy asked . " I 've got a lab this afternoon . " " Sure , kid , " Riddle said . He switched on the lights , pulled out his billfold , and counted out ten crisp hundred-dollar bills . " I 'm adding a little bonus , " he said . " Just remember , not a word to anybody . Do n't compromise the mission . " " Do n't worry about me , Dr. Green , " Wendy said . " Listen , he wants to meet me here Sunday afternoon after church . Is that okay ? " " Nope , " Riddle told her . " The mission 's completed now . You quit your job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there 's a couple of other Senators been giving me the eye . " " Forget it , " Riddle snapped . " Okay , " Wendy said . " Look , can you tell me what you 're gon na do with this thing ? I mean , is it gon na turn up at my neighborhood theater or what ? " " Do n't get nosy , " Riddle said . " You 've got your money , now you just button your lip , kid ! " He gave her a look that made her blood run cold . He was such a weird character , Wendy thought . Sort of flaky sometimes , but dashing too , like somebody in a spy movie . " I wo n't say anything , " she promised . " All I want to do is to stop that degenerate from being President . " " You 've done your part , kid . "  | " Listen , could we get together sometime ? " she said shyly . " You know , just to talk about politics and stuff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to keep a low profile for a while , " Riddle said . " So long , kid . " " Goodbye , Dr. Green , " she said . " Thanks for everything . " She blinked back a tear and rushed from the apartment . When she was gone , Riddle yanked off the fuzzy blond wig he was wearing , lit a Marlboro , and sank down on the sofa , deep in thought . Wendy had asked the right question : What was he going to do next ? He was nearing the most dangerous , most delicate phase of the mission . Donovan Ripley would never be President now ; that much was certain . But the details were tricky and , to Riddle 's future , all-important . If all he wanted to do was remove Ripley from politics , he would simply send the Senator a copy of the film with a note saying that if he did n't resign from office by such and such a date other copies of the film would be made public . Ripley would have no choice . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because of his health or his wife 's health or whatever he was resigning from the Senate and leaving politics forever . His only possible alternative would be to find and kill whoever had the film , and Riddle was confident that they could n't trace him . They might find Wendy , might torture her , but she did n't know his real name or where he lived or even what he looked like , for he 'd worn the wig and tinted contact lenses whenever he dealt with her . Of course , he could make the film public without giving Ripley a chance to resign first . He would have to resign anyway , and it would give Riddle pleasure to see the big oaf disgraced . Riddle had a recurring fantasy about how to make the film public . He had read with fascination about the television studio technicians who had ( accidentally , they claimed ) shown a porno movie over a cable-television network one night . Riddle 's fantasy was to show Senator Ripley 's sexploits over national television during halftime of the Super  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd have to take over the studio  --  but it would be worth it . But that was fun and games , and there were more serious considerations at hand . Like money . That film was worth a million dollars . Senator Ripley would surely give that for it , and there were others who would no doubt outbid him . Riddle could get the money and retire to Spain or the Dominican Republic and live like a king , but he aspired to something more than that . He wanted to serve his country . And he wanted to serve his country in one particular job . Byron Riddle wanted to be Director of Central Intelligence . It would n't be easy . They usually gave the job to bankers and Wall Street lawyers and other big shots , not to the poor stiffs who risked their lives in the trenches . But things were different now ; he had the movie that was the biggest bargaining chip in Washington . The question was how to proceed . He could go straight to Ed Murphy , but he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ risky . He thought he might talk to Whit Stone first ; Whit was a smart man , maybe the smartest in town . Perhaps they 'd bargain with certain Congressional leaders who could easily arrange the Directorship for the man who 'd forced Donovan Ripley out of politics . However they played the political end of it , there would also have to be a public-relations campaign as well . Riddle would have to surface , to develop the right image for the job he coveted . He had thought it through carefully . There woidd have to be some lesser job first , perhaps the Deputy Directorship . Then the PR campaign could begin . They could put out a bio telling some of his real exploits and inventing others . He would testify at Congressional hearings and appear on Meet the Press . The Times would do a " Man in the News " piece , and an old colleague of Riddle 's , now a senior editor at Time , could be counted on for a helpful article there . That kind of publicity , plus the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the Directorship could be his within a year .  | Byron Riddle was confident . He had worked hard for years , he had sacrificed much , and now it was all about to be repaid . The time was right . The Agency needed a man with guts and vision , and Byron Riddle was that man . He got up from the sofa , took the film out of the projection machine , put it into his briefcase , checked his gun , and left the apartment with a smile on his face . Byron Riddle was coming in from the cold .  | 18 THE PRESIDENT and the comedian were posing for photographers on the first tee at the Thunderbird Country Club outside Palm Springs . The comedian , Pete Gaynor , was wearing a bright red polo shirt and mugging for the photographers and the club members who 'd drifted over to watch . The President , Charles Whitmore , was staring over the photographers ' heads at the snow-covered mountains in the distance , thinking how fine it would be to play a round @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without his wisecracking host , Pete Gaynor . " I 'll tell you this , fellows , " Gaynor quipped to the reporters , " I 'll play golf with the President but I sure would n't run against him . That last guy who did  --  boy , I hear he 's still running ! " The crowd laughed contentedly , reporters and country clubbers alike . Gaynor 's off-the-cuff quips were n't all that  | funny , but he had been making America laugh for forty years , in movies , on radio , on television , and the laughter came instinctively now , as homage to the past . Nick Galiano was standing off to one side , just out of camera range . Nick was wearing a polo shirt and expensive golf pants too , like all the country clubbers clustered around the first tee , but his face set him apart . Theirs were smooth , rich men 's faces ; Nick 's was forever a Baltimore bartender 's face , a workingman 's face , and now he was scowling while everyone else was smiling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called to the President , " Hey , Boss , this place is really something . Maybe you ought to paint it white and move in . The crowd laughed appreciatively , and Gaynor rolled his eyes in mock frustration . " Who is this guy , Mr. President ? " he cracked . " He 's stealing all my lines . " There was more laughter  --  the crowd was getting more than it had bargained for  --  and Nick Galiano winked , lined up an imaginary putt , and came back with another joke : " No kidding , Boss , this Palm Springs is the greatest . Maybe Agnew was n't so dumb after all . " The reporters and photographers broke up over that line , although the country clubbers did n't find it as amusing . Charles Whitmore , who noticed almost everything , noticed one of the reporters scribbling in his notebook , the bearded reporter , the one from Rolling Rock or Stone Age or whatever it was called . " That last remark of Nick 's was off the record , fellows , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put his notebook away . The President had also noticed a certain tightening of Pete Gaynor 's mouth at the Agnew remark . He guessed the comedian and the sometime Vice President had been pretty chummy a few years back . To hell with him , Whitmore thought ; he wanted this , not me . But that was not precisely true . It was a decades-old tradi-  | tion that Presidents and would-be Presidents who visited Palm Springs played golf with Pete Gaynor , for Gaynor was a beloved American institution , America 's Clown Prince , and to be photographed with him was part of politics , like putting on an Indian war bonnet or marching in the St. Patrick 's Day parade . And it was more than the photographs that would go out over the wire services . Pete Gaynor was a rich man , and he had friends who were even richer . He was a man of influence , like a corporation president or a newspaper publisher , and when he called with his golfing invitations no politician could quite refuse . It was like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and bear it . " Hey , fellows , you know where the President is staying , do n't you ? " Gaynor called out . " At the Hollenfield estate . Boy , have you seen that place ? The Hollenfield estate is what God would have done if He 'd had the money . " The old joke brought new laughter . Charles Whitmore was getting impatient . He was tired of being used as a straight man . " Let 's get started , Pete , " he said . " Nick , you sure you do n't want to play ? " " Not me , Boss , " Nick Galiano said . " I 've got a hangover that wo n't quit . " " Well , you know what they say , Nick , " Pete Gaynor injected . " When a man 's got a hangover he needs an aspirin , but when a woman 's got a hangover , she needs a brassiere . And there 's plenty of ' em needing one these days ! " Whitmore noted that the comedian had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to join their round of golf . But he understood that . Pete Gaynor played golf with Presidents , not with their sidekicks . And Nick did look like he had a monster of a hangover . He 'd been drinking too much recently . Whitmore made a mental note to find out why , then walked over to tee off . The President 's golf game was strong but erratic . He hooked his first drive over the head of a Secret Service man  | who was standing by a palm tree two hundred yards down the fairway . " Take a Mulligan , Mr. President , " Pete Gaynor said . " All visiting royalty gets a Mulligan on the first tee . " Whitmore 's second drive was high and straight , and drew a scattering of applause from the bystanders . Whitmore grinned and waved at them , wondering how many of them had voted for him . Twenty percent at best , he estimated . Gaynor stepped up to his ball , winked at the crowd , did a little dipsy-doodle with his club , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his ball soaring thirty yards past the President 's . " Nice shot , Pete , " Whitmore said . He meant it . He was thinking that the old bastard was seventy if he was a day . " I owe it all to clean living , " Gaynor said . " Come on , Mr. President , I 'll give you a lift . " He led Whitmore to a pale blue golf cart with a fringed canopy atop it and his initials on its side . Nick Galiano spit on the grass and climbed into a cart with Walt Harrigan , the head of the Secret Service detail . Walt was a trim , well-tanned young man with a big nose and shaggy brown hair . " That guy queer , Walt ? " Nick asked as they bounced along the fairway twenty feet behind the President . " Gaynor ? No , he just acts that way . The old goat 's up to his ears in girls . " " You met him before ? " " Yeah , I used to go around when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after that . " " What do you think of him ? " " He 's a prick . He cuts off the jokes when the reporters are gone ; then he 's just another arrogant rich guy . He used to always be asking our guys to help him find his golf balls . Hell , man , we 're not here to look for golf balls . The trouble was , back in those days you did n't know if you could argue with guys like that and keep your job . But we straightened him out . "  | " What 'd you do ? " Walt stopped the golf cart and lowered his voice while the President hit his second shot . " Well , let 's just say that whenever he asked one of our men to find his ball , that ball never got found . Or maybe it got found two feet under water . He caught on . He quit sending us free booze , but it was worth it . These fat cats are all like that . They suck up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dirt . About the only one I 've met I gave a damn for was Jeff Fields , that actor who hung around on the campaign . He was a decent guy . " They parked in the shade of some palm trees to watch the President and Gaynor make their putts . The comedian holed out from twelve feet for his par , and Whitmore two-putted from six feet out for a bogey . " Hey , let 's double the bet , " Gaynor cracked and got a ripple of laughter from the reporters and photographers who were following the round . The President frowned and looked sharply at Walt Harrigan . " I 'll be right back , " Walt said and jumped out of the cart and walked over to the reporters . " Sorry , fellows , " he said . " No press for the rest of the round . " " What the hell ? " said the man from the New York Times . " We 've always gone the whole round before . " " Sorry , " the Secret Service agent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " From who ? " the bearded reporter asked . " It 's security , " the agent lied . " Why do n't you fellows have a couple of drinks in the clubhouse and pick them up coming in on nine ? " " I could use a drink , " one reporter admitted , and after a little more grumbling the gentlemen of the press started back toward the clubhouse . " Who 's the one with the beard ? " Nick asked as he and Walt bounced along the golf-cart path toward the second tee . " We 've checked him out , " Walt said . " He 's harmless . " " There 're none of them harmless , " Nick said bitterly .  | " They 're vultures . No , they 're snipers , that 's what they are . They 're all buddy-buddy with the Boss when they 're with him  --  drink his booze and laugh at his jokes  --  but then they sneak off somewhere and they do to you what Oswald did to Kennedy , except they use words instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ em are n't so bad , " Walt said . " They 're hypocrites too , " Nick said . " All so noble and moral and holier than thou . You know where half those bastards are right now ? Back at the hotel shacked up with some barmaid or some broad they flew in from L.A. " Walt smiled at that . " Yeah , " he said . " They call it the West of the Potomac Rule  --  no reporter ever talks east of the Potomac about what any reporter does west of the Potomac . " " You guys are keeping an eye on them , are n't you ? " " We know who 's where , " the agent said . " And with whom . " He stopped the cart again and they watched the President and Pete Gaynor make their drives off the second tee . This time the President sliced his shot into the next fairway , and the comedian whacked another straight , solid shot down the middle . Then their little caravan of canopied golf carts went putt-putting off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town , " Walt Harrigan said . " He 's in town , " Nick said . " Will he be coming around ? " " No way , " Nick said grimly . " Jeff ai n't quite respectable . There 's too many stories about him and women . Women , men , dogs and billygoats . You ca n't mess around the way he does and expect to hang out with the President . " " Yeah , " Walt said . " And was n't that strange about that girl being killed in his house ? " " It was n't so strange , " Nick said . " Him and her were pretty good pals . Real good pals , if you want the truth . " The young agent wondered what that meant , but Nick dropped the subject , and it was forgotten as the golf match wound its way up and down the fairways that were like green  | carpets , past man-made lakes that sparkled like silver in the midmorning sun , past the pastel-walled guest houses that were scattered about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After a while Charles Whitmore tuned out Pete Gaynor and began to get his game under control . At the ninth green , as the reporters rejoined them , he chipped in from a sand trap for a birdie . Pete Gaynor threw up his hands in mock dismay and proceeded to three-putt for a double bogey , giving Whitmore the front nine by one stroke . Whitmore watched with interest as the comedian blew an eighteen-inch putt . Had he missed it on purpose ? Some people did . It was so damn stupid . Did they think he cared ? " How about another nine ? " Pete Gaynor asked as they left the green and walked toward the photographers . " Double or nothing . " " Sorry , Pete , " Whitmore said . " They 've got me working this afternoon . " " Well , I 'll see you tonight , " the comedian said . " I 'm introducing you at the dinner . " " Do n't steal the show . " " Ha ! I know a scene stealer when I see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ photographers were calling for more pictures , and Gaynor whipped out their scorecard and made a show of signing it . " You know , Mr. President , " he said softly , " there 'll be some fellows at the dinner tonight who hope you 'll say something about this welfare mess . These are fellows who 're behind you all the way , but they 're worried about some of these pie-inthe-sky giveaway schemes that keep coming out of Washington . " The pitch , Whitmore thought ; the pitch always comes last . " I 'll keep that in mind , Pete . Thanks for the tip . " " You know me , I 'm no politician , " Gaynor continued . " But , by golly , it sure seems like there 's a lot of people in this country who do n't want to work for a living . " " Yeah , " Whitmore said . " I run into them sometimes . " He  | turned to the photographers . " That 's all , fellows . See you tonight . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in beside him . " Say , Mr. President , maybe after the dinner tonight you 'd like to drop by my place for a little relaxation . No politics , just a few drinks and a few laughs . And a couple of sweet young things might drop by too  --  kids I 'm helping get started in show biz . They 'd love to meet you . I mean , they 'd love to meet you . " The white-haired old comedian winked , and Whitmore almost laughed aloud . Did they think he was that dumb ? " Well , let 's see how things work out , Pete . I 've got a pretty rough schedule . " He hurried away and stepped into the coolness of his limousine . Ed Murphy was waiting there with a list of phone calls and a pile of memos . As the Lincoln glided away from the Thunderbird Club , Murphy began to open fire with all the new problems of the past two hours and Whitmore shot back his solutions to them . By the time they turned onto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them and Whitmore changed the subject . " Ed , that funnyman back there . I do n't want to see any more of him . " " He 's introducing you tonight . " " I know that . But no more after tonight . Would you believe this ? That character wanted me to come over to his place tonight and meet some girls . " " It 's happened before . " " Some of those bastards before did n't have any taste . And not much sense . Listen , I want an insert in my speech tonight . Put some of that stuff in from my Princeton speech about people helping other people , human interdependence . You remember that part ? " " You understand , these are the fat cats tonight . " " I know who they are . I 'm thinking maybe they do n't know who I am . " " Right . "  | " Something else . Have you noticed Nick boozing a lot lately ? " " Definitely . " " Keep an eye on him . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to do something . " " Right , " Ed Murphy said again . The limousine slowed and turned in at the main gate of the Hollenfield estate , then sped past their absent host 's private golf course , past his airstrip , past lakes with swans gliding atop them , past outdoor and indoor tennis courts , and past an Olympic-size pool beside which six off-duty Secret Service men were playing an endless poker game . Finally they rounded a curve and the Hollenfield mansion rose up in the distance , a pink-walled palace shimmering against the bright blue desert sky . " Did I tell you he 's got this place for sale ? " Whitmore said . " Eight million bucks . " " It 's not big enough ? " " Not private enough . See that building over there ? " Far in the distance the upper floors of a new luxury condominium could be glimpsed above the trees . " He says the people in the penthouse might see him playing golf , if they used binoculars , " Whitmore explained . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The poor suffering bastard , " Ed Murphy said . He began to gather up his papers as the limousine neared the mansion . " You know , " he said , " a couple of the reporters were saying that maybe it 's not a good idea for you to use this place . They were saying ? " " I know what they were saying , " Whitmore replied . " To hell with them . They 'd be here if they could be . Let 's go first class while we can . " The Lincoln stopped in front of the mansion and a marine captain jerked open the door for the President . But Whitmore turned back to Ed Murphy . " Did I ever tell you what Huey Long used to say about the  | way he dressed ? They used to jump on him about dressing like a millionaire . He said he wanted every mother in Louisiana to look at Huey Long and think her boy could grow up and dress like that some day . " Ed Murphy grinned one of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car , then turned back again . " Did you talk to our actor friend ? " " I talked to him . " " Is he okay ? " " He 's okay . Not happy , but okay . " " Good , " the President said and moved gracefully out of his limousine and up the steps of his borrowed mansion .  | 19 THE HOUR WAS LATE , the office was quiet as a tomb , and Ben Norton was trying without success to concentrate on an article in the American Law Review . He kept seeing Gabe Pincus 's face leering at him between the lines , and whenever he glanced at his watch he saw Gabe there too , grinning at him like a malevolent Mickey Mouse . He tossed the law journal aside and stared glumly at the wall , wondering why he had let Gabe talk him into this . It was madness . Worse , it was criminal . But it was also necessary , Gabe had argued , and he had prevailed . Norton heard George Evans , the only other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cubicle next door . Norton got up and looked out his window . He watched some people emerge from the French restaurant below him , then he looked down the street and thought he saw a figure lurking in the shadows of a record store 's doorway . Gabe ? Or Norton 's imagination ? He shook his head , then turned at the sound of a rapping on his door .  | " Come on in , George , " he said , and a slight , nervous man in his early thirties stepped uncertainly in . " Do n't let me interrupt you , " he said . " You 're not , George . I 'm about to knock off for the night . " " Me too , " George Evans admitted . " What 's got you burning the midnight oil ? " Evans obviously wanted to talk , and Norton wanted to postpone the madness ahead , so he motioned for his colleague to sit down . " Just catching up on my reading , " he said . " So damn much is happening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're getting a new assignment , Ben . Riding herd on corporate policy , is that it ? Sounds like a coup . " Norton guessed Whit Stone was letting the word spread . That was interesting . He had n't said anything more to Norton about the assignment . Norton wondered what that meant . " Whit and I have discussed it , " he said . " But I do n't know how it will work out . " Evans managed his hangdog smile . " That 's how Whit operates , is n't it ? You never know where you stand . Sometimes I wonder if it 's worth it . " Rather than reply , Norton busied himself pouring two iceless Scotch and waters . George Evans was a decent fellow , and a competent lawyer , who was in the process of having his heart broken  --  and his career mangled  --  by Whitney Stone . Or , in a larger sense , by the unwritten , all-powerful system by which the nation 's biggest law firms decide who is to succeed and who is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prestigious firms hired three or four young lawyers for each one they expected eventually to take into partnership . After five or six years on trial , it was up or out . The chosen few became partners , with life tenure and an ever-increasing share of the firm 's profits . The rejects were expected to leave , not exactly in disgrace , but  | knowing they would thereafter be second-class citizens of their chosen profession . Men were blackballed by the senior partners  --  for it was much like the college fraternity system  --  for varied reasons . Some were incompetent . Others wore the wrong ties , espoused the wrong causes , or had married the wrong wives . Most of the men who were passed over moved on to smaller law firms . Some left the profession or turned to booze . Now and then you heard of one who 'd killed himself . Sometimes they hung on in limbo for a year or two , hoping for a miracle . That was what George Evans was doing , and Whitney Stone was letting him twist slowly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't face reality . Perhaps it was because he had an ambitious wife pushing him on . " I just do n't know if it 's worth it , " Evans repeated , rubbing at his stubble of beard . " Sometimes I think I 'd rather teach . The money is n't everything . Do n't you ever feel like that ? " Norton was reminded of the all-night bull sessions about Life and Truth and the Future that had gone on endlessly in his college days . Life is just college continued , he thought , blackballs and bull sessions and big men on campus , until finally you graduate into death . " Sure , I feel that way sometimes , George , " he said . " To part of me teaching would be great . No sweat , no pressure , and the joys of pedantry . But practicing law appeals to part of me too . " He could n't say to George Evans what he wanted to say about the challenge and the competition of the big leagues , about the thirst to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so deeply and permanently ingrained in him and in almost all the men of his generation . His generation did n't drop out of the system ; they dug in and did their damnedest to beat the system . " If Whit just was n't so damned secretive , " Evans said . " You never know what 's in his mind . I 've never known anyone like him . Sometimes I want to punch him in the nose . " He smiled wanly and glanced at the ceiling . " Just kidding ,  | Whit , " he said . It was a standing joke among the younger lawyers that Stone bugged their offices . " Well , it sounds like your future is all set , " Evans continued . " You have n't heard anything on the grapevine about us other poor slobs , have you ? " That was a bit much . Part of Norton pitied Evans and another part scorned his helplessness . " There is n't much of a grapevine around here , " he said . He finished his drink and stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " I guess so , " Evans said . They got their things together and walked the long corridor to the law firm 's front door . Norton shut the door , started toward the elevator , then stopped . " Would you double-check the door , George ? " he said . " I 'm not sure it locked . " Evans went back and rattled the doorknob . " It 's locked , " he said . " Good , " Norton said , and they took the elevator down to the lobby , where Norton said a loud " good night " to the drowsy guard and wrote his name and the time more legibly than usual on the sign-out sheet . It was midnight . " Can I give you a lift anywhere ? " Evans asked . " I think I 'll walk , " Norton said . They waved goodbye , and Norton started down the street , past the French restaurant and around the corner by the record store . " Ben , over here , " a voice called from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pincus . " Is it all clear ? " Gabe whispered . " That guy and I were the last to leave , " Norton said . " Who was he ? " " Just a lawyer . " " What about the cleaning women ? " " They 've finished , the office is empty and the lights are out , " Norton said . " Gabe , I 'm not sure about this . " " Quit your bellyaching , " the reporter snapped . " Where are the keys ? " Norton reached reluctantly into his pocket , just as a man  | and woman rounded the corner . Gabe pulled him back against the wall . The couple walked on by , talking excitedly about the new Bergman movie . " The keys , the keys , " Gabe whispered impatiently . Norton handed them over . " The big one opens the door from the parking lot , " he said . " You can take the stairs up without going through the lobby . The other one opens the front door to the office . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office is the last one , all the way down the corridor . " " I know where it is , " Gabe said . " You just get the hell away from here and make yourself conspicuous somewhere . " " For Christ 's sake , be careful , " Norton said and hurried off to find a cab . Gabe stayed in the shadows for a few minutes watching the dark windows of Coggins , Copeland , and Stone . He was better dressed than usual , in a dark suit and vest , and was carrying a leather briefcase , looking as much as possible like a lawyer who had been working late . But his dark shoes had rubber soles and his briefcase contained burglar 's tools , not legal briefs . He did n't like this any better than Norton did . He 'd cut a lot of corners in his police-beat days , but in recent years he 'd relied on more subtle means than burglary to achieve his journalistic ends . He had too much to lose now . But there was n't much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ file . Gabe took a deep breath , squared his shoulders , stepped out of the shadows , and marched confidently down the street . Minutes later he was standing in the darkness of Coggins , Copeland , and Stone 's reception room . He switched on his flashlight , shone it down the long corridor that led toward Whitney Stone 's office , and began to creep in that direction . When the corridor jutted to the left , he peered around the corner cautiously  --  and jumped back when he saw a light beneath an office door . Gabe froze , silently cursing Ben Norton . Lawyers were all worthless , he thought ; the ones who were n't crooked were dumb . Was someone in the office ? Or had Norton been wrong about all the lights being off ? Gabe could  | hear his heart pounding . His choice was to leave or to wait . If he heard any sound from the office , or if anyone emerged from it , he was sure he could beat them to the front door . So he waited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ street , the roar of buses , the slamming of car doors , an occasional peal of laughter . Gabe tuned them out and focused on the sliver of light beneath the door . As he waited , his thoughts were on the Hoover file , which might be fifty feet down that hallway , which might be in his hands in half an hour . The Hoover file ! Gabe trembled at the thought of it . The whole blinding , overpowering truth about thirty years of American politics , a tale of greed and lust and deceit and hyprocrisy and corruption on a scale unmatched in the history of the world . The truth that even the most dedicated journalist could only see in bits and pieces . The truth that only God knew ( if , indeed , God existed , which Gabe doubted ) and that in any event God was not sharing with journalists . Oddly , perhaps , Gabe was n't sure what he 'd do with the file if he found it . He did n't want to sell it , and he doubted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was for his soul 's sake that he wanted it . He wanted to look truth in the face . He wanted to look at other men and see past their well-crafted public facades into the darkness of their souls . Gabe had spent a decade being lied to , used , tricked , condescended to , and scorned by politicians , and he had come to think of himself as one of the few honest men in Washington . That was his vanity , not the prizes he had won but the temptations he had resisted . The Hoover file , if it could be found , would at once confirm all his prejudices and justify all his vanities . When thirty minutes passed with no sound or movement within the lighted room , Gabe decided that the cleaning woman must have left the light on and that fool Norton not noticed . He slipped silently around the corner , paused before the lighted office , heard nothing , and moved on toward Whitney Stone 's door . A passkey opened it , and Gabe shut the door behind him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | was a big rectangular room , with the desk at one end and a sofa and chairs at the other . He noticed a door near the sof a ? Norton had n't mentioned that  --  and hurried across to try it . The door opened into a small room with a file cabinet and a bed , and it contained another door that led to a bathroom . Satisfied , Gabe returned to Stone 's desk . He unlocked the top drawer and found a bottle of aspirin , a vial of amyl nitrite capsules , a Bible , several legal briefs and a small blue address book . He put the address book in his pocket and searched the other drawers , finding nothing of interest until the bottom one , where his light fell upon a large manila envelope . He eased the envelope from the drawer , opened it , and found a typewritten manuscript inside . His hands shook as he searched for the title page , hoping to find Hoover 's name , but the words he found were : A FRIEND IN POWER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the document into his briefcase , then began his search for the safe . He found it on the wall behind one of the prints of red-coated English gentlemen riding to hounds , and he soon found that it was , as he 'd feared , beyond his safe-cracking capabilities . He 'd been instructed in the art by an ex-con of his acquaintance , but his fingers lacked the master 's touch . When he twisted the dial , his fingertips were not sensitive to the telltale clink of the tumblers within . He shrugged , put his gloves back on , and replaced the hunting scene ; in truth , he doubted that Stone would be so foolish as to leave the Hoover file in so vulnerable a spot . He crossed the dark office again and stepped inside the small room with the file cabinet . Just as he pushed the door to , he heard a sound . He cut off his light and peered out through an inch of open  | door . As he watched , the office door swung open and a light shot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've got you covered , " a man barked . " Come out with your hands up . " Gabe saw in profile a wiry dark-haired man with a revolver in one hand and a flashlight in the other . Gabe shut the door to a crack and watched as the man moved to the desk , tried its drawers , and then turned in a slow , uncertain circle , his gun before him , peering around the silent office . When his gaze reached the door behind which Gabe was hiding , he began to inch forward . Gabe slammed the door , locked it , and pushed the file cabinet in front of it . Then he stepped into the bathroom and locked its door too . He figured he had three choices . To do battle with an armed man , to surrender and hope he had enough on Whit Stone to negotiate his way out of jail , or to escape . " Come out in five seconds or I 'm coming in , " the man shouted . Somehow , the melodramatic cry gave Gabe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ struggling with the bathroom window . Then he heard a muffled explosion . The son of a bitch was shooting the lock off . Gabe threw open the window and looked out . The sidewalk was twenty feet or more below him , too far to jump , but there was a narrow ledge running around the building . He heard the man push open the outer door and knock over the file cabinet . Gabe heaved himself out the window and began inching his way along the ledge , but he 'd gone only a dozen feet when his pursuer emerged from the bathroom window and pointed his gun at Gabe 's wildly pounding heart . " Come on back , buddy , or I 'll blow your brains out . " " Okay , pal , you 've got me , " Gabe said . " Keep cool . " " You bet I 've got you , " the man whispered triumphantly . Gabe looked down . A dozen feet below him the big blueand-white striped canopy of Chez Pierre stretched out over the sidewalk . Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tough get going , and he plunged into space .  | The canvas groaned , ripped , and deposited Gabe none too gently on the sidewalk . Still clinging to his briefcase , he got to his feet , pleased with himself  --  it was like his old police-beat days  --  then looked up and was astounded to see his pursuer inching along the ledge and then leaping into the air toward the torn canopy . Good Lord , Gabe thought , that character is crazy . And then he turned and ran for his life . His pursuer plunged through the canopy and hit the sidewalk hard , howling with pain as his ankle seemed to crack . But when a taxi driver slowed down and asked what the hell was going on , the man waved a gun at him and began trotting painfully down the street after Gabe Pincus . Gabe rounded a corner , running for all he was worth , then spotted a police car at the next intersection . He feared the police almost as much as the madman behind him , so he turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a theater called the Gaiety which , its marquee announced , was presenting a double bill of The Joys of Boys and Hole Lot of Fun . Any port in a storm , Gabe thought , and tossed some bills at the ticket taker and darted inside . The theater was dark , smoke-filled , and packed with men of all ages . Up on the screen some naked boys of sixteen or so were dancing the Charleston . Gabe looked for a fire exit , could n't find one , and dropped into an empty seat near the front of the theater . Twisting his head around , he saw his pursuer limping down the aisle , shining his flashlight along the rows of theatergoers . Gabe sank deeper into his seat , glanced once at the naked lads on the screen , and was startled to feel a hand settle gently onto his thigh . Jesus H. Christ , Gabe thought , and jabbed the man beside him hard with his elbow . " You need n't be rough , " the man said indignantly , removing his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advancing relentlessly down the aisle , shining his flashlight down each  | row , and in the process revealing some remarkable scenes : men stripped to the waist , men in wigs and dresses , men with their heads in other men 's laps . When his pursuer was three rows from him , Gabe dropped to the floor and began to crawl through a tangle of men 's legs toward the back of the theater . Soon , curious hands began to pinch and prod him . He tried to ignore them , but when one hairy-legged tormentor goosed him beyond all decency , Gabe twisted his ankle until he heard it crack . Gabe crawled on , trying to avoid the warm puddles that dotted the floor like land mines on a battlefield , as all around him men stood and shrieked at the two intruders , the one crawling underfoot , the other shining his light into their dark pleasures . When the circle of light was three feet from him , Gabe struggled to his feet and found himself face to face with his pursuer . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man barked out of the side of his mouth . Gabe knocked him into a row of hysterical moviegoers and raced out of the theater , only to find two square-jawed D.C. policemen blocking the sidewalk . " What 's your hurry , mister ? " one of the cops asked . " It 's a lousy show , " Gabe mumbled . " Hey , do n't I know you ? " the other cop said . " Ai n't you some reporter ? " " Yeah , " Gabe said . " I 'm Evans Novak . " " Sure , " the cop said , beaming . " I read your column every day . What 're you doing in this dump ? " His face suddenly darkened . " Hey , you 're not ? " " Hell , no ! " Gabe said manfully . " I 'm out to expose the bastards . Security risks . Half the State Department 's in there . Hey , you better get inside . Some madman 's on the loose . " " We 'll get him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them columns , Mr. Novak . " The two policemen charged into the Gaiety Theater , and Gabriel Pincus ducked down a nearby alley , weary but victorious , clutching his briefcase to his heart .  | 20 NORTON AWOKE AT DAWN feeling like a man on his way to the gallows . He switched on his bedside radio and twisted the dial madly , searching for the bad news . Unable to find it , he sat by the front door until the boy delivered his Post , then tore through its many pages in search of the story that would be headlined : " Famed Reporter Held in Law Firm Break-in ; Accomplice Sought . " But there was nothing . Norton threw down the paper , unable to summon even his usual morning 's smile for Doonesbury . He started to call Gabe 's house , but decided that Gabe 's phone was surely bugged , even if his own was not . He pictured a defiant Gabe at police headquarters , being grilled , threatened , beaten , but refusing to name his accomplice . Then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a deal with the police and putting all the blame on Norton . Finally he decided to face the music . He dressed and walked to work , trying in vain to savor the gorgeous May  | morning , telling himself it might be his last morning of freedom for a long time . He was half surprised to find no police cars outside his office building , only some workmen unloading their truck in front of Chez Pierre . He pushed open the door of Coggins , Copeland , and Stone despairingly , expecting to face a platoon of detectives , but in fact facing only Josie , the receptionist . " Boy , do you look zonked , " Josie said . " What 'd you do last night ? " Norton stammered , unable to frame a reply , and finally Josie giggled and said , " Well , anyway , you just had a phone call . " " Who was it ? " he asked anxiously . " He would n't say . He said he 'd call back . " Norton clutched at the slender @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was still at large . Perhaps he 'd gotten away with it . Norton breathed deeply and stumbled down the hallway toward his office . Halfway there he encountered George Evans . " Say , Ben , " Evans began , " did Whit ask you about what happened last night ? " " Last night ? " he repeated innocently . " Somebody tried to break into his office . He saw on the signout sheet that you and I were the last to leave , and he thought we might have noticed something . Has n't he talked to you ? " " Not yet , " Norton said . " He probably figures you know everything I know . How was he ? I mean , was he upset ? " " Not at all , " Evans said . " It was strange . It was the most pleasant he 's been to me in years . " Beware the pleasant cobra , Norton thought , and dragged himself back to his little office , which , he mused , was about the size of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the phone . " It 's your mystery caller again , " Josie said , her voice aglow with curiosity . " All he 'll say is that he 's a friend of yours and it 's important . Do you want to talk to him ? "  | " Why not ? " Norton sighed . Josie clicked off  --  or would she be listening ? ? and Norton waited to hear Gabe 's harsh conspirator 's voice ; instead the voice he heard was familiar , gentle , and distraught . " Ben , I ca n't say who it is over the phone . I 've got to talk with you . " " Well , why do n't you just drop by the office , my friend ? " Norton said . " We have visiting hours from noon till two . " " I ca n't come there . I have my reasons . Let 's meet somewhere . It 's urgent . " Norton would have hung up , but he was tantalized by the voice . He knew this man . He had talked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life of him remember where . " You do n't think my phone 's tapped , do you ? " he said , stalling , amusing himself with his gallows humor . " It could be . " " That 's right , it could be . But if you want to get into paranoia , my friend , you 've got to dive in all the way . If they 're tapping my phone , they 'll follow us to our meeting place too . The bastards are everywhere . " " Wo n't you be serious ? " the man said . " This is urgent . I 'll be in Lafayette Square at noon . Will you meet me ? " Norton 's shoulders rocked with silent laughter . " Sure , " he said . " Why not ? Who 'd ever look for us in Lafayette Square ? " " Good , " the man said . " If you do n't know me , " Norton went on , " I 'll be the guy with two men in dark suits following ten feet behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Lafayette Square at noon on a bright day in May . Fearless squirrels sharing bureaucrats ' lunches . Black secretaries eating tunafish sandwiches on concrete chessboards . Andy Jackson astride his horse in perpetual triumph , with pigeons taking aim at him from above and tourists with Japanese cameras taking aim at him from below . The White House , serenely indiffer-  | ent , glistening across Pennsylvania Avenue . Norton found an empty bench and skimmed the first edition of the Star for news of Gabe 's incarceration . Then a slender young man , tanned , tieless , wearing an expensive sport coat and wraparound dark glasses , dropped down beside him . The dark glasses concealed his identity for a final instant . His face had not been so lined with care the last time they 'd met . " Well , Jeff , long time no see , " Norton said . He thought he was cracking , freaking out , that Lafayette Square and the people there and the White House across the way were all part of a gigantic movie set and he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Look , " Jeff Fields began impatiently , " I 've got a lot to say and not much time to say it . " " Why do n't you begin by telling me why your goon banged me on the head the last time we met ? " " He was n't supposed to , " the actor said . " It was a mistake . I 'm sorry . Okay ? " " Sure , " Norton said . " All is forgiven . What brings you to the citadel of democracy ? " " Wait a minute , " the actor whispered , and nodded toward the park bench across from them . A grizzled old man in a shapeless suit and a soup-stained tie had flopped down and begun reading a paperback copy of Tales of Power . " Let 's move , " Fields said . " You picked the park , fellow , " Norton protested , but the actor was already on his feet . Norton sighed and followed him down the gravel path past the statue of Andy Jackson until they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Sly Stone T-shirt was sitting on the grass nearby . After one glance at the two white men he got up and left . " There are only the hunters and the hunted , Fields , " Norton said . " Even the squirrels are wired for sound . It helps to mumble . " " Look , Ben , I 've done a lot of thinking since I saw you in Palm Springs . You were playing straight with me but I did n't  | play straight with you . Now I 'm going to level with you . I 'm going to tell you some things you may not like , but they 're true . All I ask is that you hold them in confidence . " " No promises , " Norton said . " No promises to people who have their house guests tossed in ditches . " " I knew Donna better than I told you I did , " the actor said . He seemed so intent on his own lines that he had tuned out Norton 's side of the dialogue . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women . Most of it 's true . Most of the women I meet do n't know anything but sex , do n't think anything but sex , do n't want anything but sex . But Donna was different . I met her on the campaign  --  that was my first mistake , trying to play that game . It was fun for a while , but I was out of my league . Whitmore was just using me . I finally figured that out . I was like a pet monkey they used to draw crowds . And I picked up a lot of checks . But I hung around . And then I met Donna , and she was the only decent person in that whole damned traveling circus . I liked to talk politics , and she was the only woman I 'd ever met who knew as much about politics as I did . Hell , she knew more . I flipped over the chick . After the campaign , after she moved to Carmel , I went up to see her a couple of times . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I finally got her to come see me in Palm Springs . Listen , what I 'm trying to tell you is , I asked her to marry me . And she turned me down flat . Thanks but no thanks . I could n't believe it . I mean , you do n't know what some chicks have done to try to marry me . My lawyers say if I do n't have a vasectomy I 'll be fighting paternity suits till I 'm eighty . " " Use the knife , end the strife , " Norton mused . " Man , will you quit making jokes ? I 'm trying to tell you , I dug the chick as much as you did . " " Then why do n't you quit calling her a chick ? And why do n't you get to the bottom line of this heart-rending tale ? " " The bottom line is  --  and maybe you wo n't like this , but I 'm leveling with you  --  if she was pregnant , like I heard , then it was me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She  | came to my place . That must have been when it happened . She 'd been having some problems with the Pill  --  you can ask her doctor  --  and she went off of it and she must have miscalculated . " Fields stopped , his wiry body tense , his finely chiseled mouth taut , his famous brown eyes blinking behind his wraparound dark glasses . Norton was thinking that an actor ca n't properly ply his trade behind dark glasses , that too much emotion springs from the eyes . " Why are you wearing the shades , Jeff ? To protect you from your fans or to protect you from Big Brother ? " " Is that all you 've got to say ? " " What do you want me to say ? " " Do n't you want to hear the rest ? " " What rest is there ? " " Look , I know how you must feel , but I did n't know she was pregnant . After that week in January I had to go to Spain for three months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was when she asked if she could use my place in Washington . I told you before that she did n't say why she was coming back here . That was another lie . She told me she wanted to see some friends and do some research for her book . And she mentioned you . She said she 'd heard you were due back from Paris and maybe she 'd surprise you . Look , I knew there 'd been some . . . attraction between her and Whitmore for a while and I asked her if that was part of it . She said that had nothing to do with it , that it was all dead and buried . " There were little beads of sweat glistening on the actor 's forehead and , Norton thought , a few little beads of truth glistening in what he said . " How did you find out ? " " Find out what ? " " That she was pregnant . " " My lawyer found out . Do n't ask me how . I pay him a fortune to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overalls ambled by holding aloft a cluster of brightly colored balloons . " How much ? " Norton called to him . " One dollar , brother , " the young man said . " That 's a rip-off , brother , " Norton replied . " Man , everything 's going up . Rubber 's eighty bucks a ton now . " " Do they go up ? " " Huh ? " " The balloons . Do they rise above this world of care ? You know , fly . " " Oh , sure , man . Like , up , up , and away . " Norton handed him a tarnished Kennedy half dollar and two quarters and picked a bright blue balloon . He admired it for a moment , jerking its string , letting it bounce before his eyes , then he let go of the string and watched the balloon rise above the trees . In seconds the wind caught it and sent it soaring above the White House . " What was that for ? " Jeff Fields asked wearily . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " You watch , in a minute ten Phantom jets will streak across the sky and blast that little balloon to kingdom come . Say , why did n't you come to my office ? " " What ? " " Why did n't you come to my office to tell me all this ? Why the park ? Are you a squirrel freak ? " " I do n't like lawyers ' offices , " the actor said . " I spend too much time in them already . They turn me off . " That , Norton thought , was the most sensible thing the actor had said all day . Fields pulled a monogrammed handkerchief from his pocket , took off his sunglasses and wiped his brow . There were circles under his eyes and lines in his face that had n't been there the last time they 'd met . " Ben , this last month has n't been easy on me . But now I 've told you the truth and I feel  | better about a lot of things . You can check @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slug me if you want to , but that 's the truth ! " Norton yawned . After a long pause the actor said , " Damn it , will you say something ? " " What can I say ? It 's a hell of a story . I just do n't happen to believe it . " " You do n't believe it ? " Jeff seemed truly crestfallen . " Nothing personal . " " Man , I give you my word ? " " Look , Jeff , maybe , just maybe , I 'd have believed you if I 'd put a gun to your head and sweated the story out of you . But I 'm getting leery of Greeks bearing gifts . " " Ben , I truly do not understand you . I 've come a long way to tell you the truth and ? " " Okay , okay , do n't run it again . This is where I came in . So long , Jeff . " He stood up , stretched , and started off , but the actor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ben . You 've got reason to be suspicious , but think about it . I do n't want any hard feelings between us . " No hard feelings , " Norton said . " You 're my favorite actor . Except for W. C. Fields . He any relation ? " " Ben , there 's something else I 've got to say . Will you wait a minute ? " Norton turned to face the actor , and beyond him he saw the statue of some oft-forgotten Polish patriot . That 's what America needs , he thought , more Polish patriots . Where are you , Kosciusko , now that we need you ? " I 've got this production company , " the actor said . " We 've got five pictures stacked up . Budgets anywhere from two million to ten . I 'm making so damn much money that I 'm thinking about starting a foundation to do some good with it . My only problem is that my lawyers are driving me bananas . They 're all corporate types  --  greedy , right-wing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " Listen , I need somebody young and smart and straight , somebody to watch over the whole thing , somebody I can trust who 'll give me good advice ? " " And the money 's fantastic and I 'm just the man for the job , right ? Oh , Jeff , Jeff , as gift-bearing Greeks go , you are the new Aristotle Onassis . " The actor sagged , as if someone had kicked him in the stomach . Norton realized how much he was enjoying this , what a sadist he 'd become . So many people had been screwing him over that it was sheer unadulterated bliss to screw someone else over , even this poor fool . " Let me tell you something , Jeff . You have made a miscalculation . Or whoever sent you here to do this snow job on me has made a miscalculation . You said I was young and smart and straight . Not so . Maybe I am relatively young and relatively smart , as lawyers go , but I am not straight . True @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late been undergoing a transformation . Like Clark Kent ducking into the phone booth and coming out Superman . The full moon is rising , my friend , and Dr. Jekyll has turned to Mr. Hyde . Beneath this mild exterior there lurks a bloodthirsty beast who would cut your handsome throat for a dime . I 've been screwed over for the last time , pal . You tell that to whoever sent you here . You tell them that hell hath no fury like an honest man screwed over once too often . You tell them the worm has by God turned and there 's gon na be blood on the moon . Now get out of my way before I break your worthless neck . " He marched away from the actor and crossed Jackson Place against the light . A car screeched to a stop and its driver shouted furious obscenities at Norton , but Norton did n't even notice . He was drunk with his own new-found fury , and for the first time in a long time he felt fine .  | 21 NORTON 'S @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he reached home that evening . Caught in a sudden downpour , unable to find a cab , he was drenched as he splashed the final five blocks to his house . Then , safe on his doorstep , he noticed a light within . He guessed it was either Gabe or the police . Neither prospect cheered him . He pushed open the door and found Gabe stretched out on his sofa alternately nibbling at a hangnail and guzzling Norton 's Cutty Sark . He was dressed in a filthy three-piece suit and had a purple bruise on his forehead . " How 'd you get in ? " Norton asked , peeling off his soggy coat and tossing it into the bedroom . " You better get some decent locks on your doors , " Gabe said , " or else some crook 's gon na back a truck up here and clean you out . " Norton flopped down in a chair and began taking off his shoes . " Okay , Gabe , what happened last night ? "  | " Turn on your radio , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Norton switched on the radio , dialed WGMS , and a Mozart concerto filled the room . Then he pulled his chair up close to Gabe . " What happened last night , you incompetent son of a bitch , is that you almost got me killed , " Gabe said . " There was a guy with a gun in there . " " My God ! Who was he ? " " He did n't introduce himself . I thought maybe you 'd know . " " What 'd he look like ? " " Five-eight or - nine . A hundred and fifty pounds . Black hair cut short and parted on the right . Forty-five or so . Squinty eyes and kind of a sneer on his face . " Norton shook his head . " That could be a lot of people . " " There was an office with a light on . He must have been in it . " " Gabe , all the lights were off when I left . Which office was it ? " " After you turn the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room . " " That one 's vacant . You can hear the toilet flush in there . The last guy hired always gets it . " " This guy had kind of a sharp , twangy voice . He talked like old gangster movies . I got you covered , ' stuff like that . " Distant bells chimed in Norton 's memory , but all he could think was that his feet were cold and he ought to take some aspirin . " I do n't know , Gabe , " he said . " It sounds familiar but I ca n't make the connection . " He bent over and began taking off his clammy socks . " So was the whole thing a bust , Gabe ? You risked your neck for nothing ? " " I did n't say that ! " Gabe snapped . " This ai n't exactly nothing . " He reached into his briefcase and handed Norton a manuscript . Norton looked at the title page , gasped , and turned quickly to the next page , which was headed Chapter  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Washington one windy day in the spring of 1968 , which was perhaps not the best time for anyone to arrive in Washington . " Norton put the manuscript down . " This is Donna 's novel , " he said . " The one Jeff Fields said was stolen from his office . How the hell did it get into Whit Stone 's office ? " Gabe shrugged . " Maybe somebody working for Stone stole it . Or maybe somebody else stole it and sold it to Stone . That 'd be a good thing to find out . " " I 'll find out ! " Norton declared . " I 'll go to Stone first thing in the morning and we 'll have this out . " Gabe threw up his hands . " You big oaf , will you just once use your head ? You ask him where he got the manuscript and he says somebody mailed it to him anonymously . Then he asks how you happen to know about it . What do you say ? That a pal of yours stole it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm new at this . Listen , something strange happened today . Jeff Fields came to see me , right out of the blue . " " What 'd he want ? " " He wanted to tell me that he 'd been to see Donna in January and he 'd gotten her pregnant . And that she told him she 'd come to Washington to see friends , but not to see Whitmore . And to top it off he offered me a job . " " So what 'd you say ? " " I told him I did n't believe a word of it . " " You idiot ! " Gabe cried . " Did n't I tell you to go along with them ? " " I 'm sorry , Gabe . I have this habit of telling the truth . " " You call Fields and apologize . Tell him you want to talk some more . " " He 'd never believe me now . " " People believe what they want to believe . Tell him you want to talk about that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need a job . "  | " I ought to resign , " Norton said . " I ca n't keep working for Stone . I could resign and maybe beat the truth out of him . " " You hang on there , fellow , and keep playing dumb . " The phone rang . Norton jumped up , then stopped and looked at Gabe . " Answer it , " the reporter said . " It might be good news . " Norton doubted that , but he grabbed the phone on the third ring . " Hello ? " " Ben ? It 's Penny . " " Who ? " " Penny . You know , we went to the party in Palm Springs . " It seemed long ago . He remembered a tiny girl with a pixie face . " Sure , Penny , " he said . " How 've you been ? " " Ben , I 'm in trouble . " " What 's the matter ? " " I ca n't talk now . I 've got to see you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to . " " I 'm in Chicago now . But I 'll be in Washington tomorrow night . Can I see you then ? " " Sure , come on by my house . I 'll be home by seven . Do you know my address ? " " I 'll get it , " Penny said and hung up . Norton put down the phone and saw Gabe staring at him . " What was it ? " he asked . " A girl I met in Palm Springs . A stewardess . She got me into Jeff Fields 's place . She says she 's in trouble . " " She 's not the only one , " Gabe said . " Look , there was something else I found last night . Stone 's address book . There are some damned interesting names and numbers in there . " " Like what ? " Gabe pulled the blue address book from his coat pocket . " Some of them I recognize , but some of them are just initials . Like this . G. 546-3646 . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know her . "  | " Yeah , but I do n't know why Stone has her number in his book . " " I 'll try to find out . " " Try using a little finesse when you do . Here 's another one . R. 456-7236 . ' " " The 456 is the White House prefix . The R. I do n't know about . " " I called it today . A secretary said , Mr. McNair 's office . ' " " That 's Clay McNair . He works for Ed Murphy . I met him a couple of weeks ago . " " Describe him . " " About my age . A corporate type . Tall , good-looking . Pinstriped suits and cufflinks . The young executive . I met him when I started asking questions about Donna . Ed had him keeping tabs on the police investigation . " " Maybe he was reporting to Whit Stone on the side . " " I doubt it . McNair does n't strike me as somebody Ed would trust with anything heavy . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and chews Juicy Fruit . " Norton frowned , sneezed , then sat up straight . " Hey , wait a minute ! McNair has this little cubbyhole in the White House basement . He shares it with a guy named Byron Riddle . A strange character . McNair says he 's some kind of a consultant , one who does special assignments . The time I went to see McNair I sat at Riddle 's desk and he hit the ceiling when he came in and found me there . A weird guy . " Gabe 's face came alive . " What does he look like ? " he demanded . " Average height . Slender . Dark hair . In his forties . " " That 's got ta be the one . " Gabe sighed . " What one ? " " The one last night . The guy with the gun . Does he talk crazy , like in gangster movies ? Out of the side of his mouth ? " " Yes ! Maybe it is the same guy . " " I 'll run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . Norton started pacing around the living room . " Listen , I  | just remembered something . Last week I went to a party at Gwen Bowers 's house . It was a wild night and I got loaded and at the end I went outside and there was some guy lurking in the bushes . I chased him but he got away . It could have been Riddle . " " It probably was , " Gabe said . " I 've got to get a look at this guy . You 've got to point him out to me . " " How ? " " If we watch the White House long enough , we 're bound to see him coming or going . " " If he 's coming and going . McNair said he travels a lot . " " Like to Palm Springs to steal a manuscript ? Like to Carmel to push an old Senator off a cliff ? It sounds like this guy Riddle has been doing a lot of traveling . " Norton slumped down in his chair , staring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just too much , Gabe , " he muttered . " Do you really think a guy on the White House payroll  --  the Whitmore White House  --  could be a burglar ? A murderer ? " Gabe laughed and ran his fingers through his hair , sending a shower of dandruff cascading down onto his shoulders . " Buddy boy , that 's what this is all about . Where have you been ? " " Okay , okay , it 's possible . Anything 's possible . But if that 's so , I think it 's time we took what we know to the proper authorities . " " What proper authorities ? Chuck Whitmore ? Ed Murphy ? That nitwit Attorney General ? Or maybe Whit Stone if he gets to be the next Attorney General ? " " No , not them . But there 's an investigation of Donna 's murder in progress , and her manuscript being in Stone 's desk involves him somehow . We could take what we know to the U.S. Attorney 's office and let them take it from there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you put that manuscript in Whit Stone 's desk without putting me in the slammer . Point two : Do you happen to know who the new U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia is ? "  | " Sure . Frank Kifner . Except I doubt that Frank 's personally involved in Donna 's case . One of his assistants would be handling it . " " Wrong again . He 's taken personal charge of the investigation . And the way I hear it , he 's busting ass to get an indictment . Except he 's got the minor problem of not having a case against anybody . " " What about the kid ? The one with mental problems ? " " No evidence . Which may or may not mean they wo n't indict him . They frame him , he pleads insanity , and he gets sent to an institution , which is where he belongs anyway . Everybody 's happy . " " I do n't think Frank 's that kind of a guy . " " You know him ? " Gabe asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or five years ago . He 's younger than I am . " " That 's right . He 's the youngest U.S. Attorney in the country . And he 'd like to be the youngest federal judge , or maybe the youngest Assistant Attorney General if Whit Stone gets the top job . That was another thing . Stone 's address book had Kifner 's unlisted number with an F. beside it . " " It 's not unusual that a top Washington lawyer would have the U.S. Attorney 's phone number . " " No , except that all the names in the book were spelled out except G. for Gwen and R. for Riddle and F. for Frank Kifner . He 's in select company . " " I know Frank well enough to go have a confidential talk with him . Nothing about you or the manuscript . Just a little talk about some of the strange things that have been happening . " " Kifner would steal your socks . All you 'd do is give away everything we know , and then all the rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I think Kifner 's honest . I know he 's smart . Too smart to play games with a murder investigation . "  | " My God , no wonder the South lost the war , " Gabe moaned . " Ca n't you get it through your thick head that nobody but you gives one happy damn who killed Donna Hendricks ? Whitmore wants to protect himself . Murphy wants to protect Whitmore . Kifner wants to score brownie points with the White House so he gets another promotion . Hell , the detective on the case is bucking for chief of detectives . And so it goes . Everybody 's looking out for Number One . " " What about you , Gabe ? " Norton said bitterly . " Do you care what happened to Donna ? Or just about finding that Holy Grail you call the Hoover file ? " Gabe grinned at the question . " Now you 're catching on , " he said . " Sure , I 'm helping you because you can help me . That 's how the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't start using your head . Look , you call Jeff Fields and say you want to talk to him again . Talk to Gwen Bowers and pump her about Stone . And find some excuse to see McNair again . If he shares an office with Riddle he must know something about him . " Gabe got up and shook some dandruff from his coat . " I got to go , " he said . " Look , are you still with me ? The game 's getting serious . That was n't a popgun that character pointed at me last night . " Norton started taking off his soggy necktie . His shirt felt plastered to his back . " I 'm with you , Gabe . I just wish I knew what was going on . " " I 'll tell you what 's going on , " Gabe said . " We 're about to bust this thing . Look at that ! " He extended his hands toward Norton , who gazed at them and saw nothing unusual , except that Gabe 's fingernails @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pointed to one of his wrists . " See them ? Spots ! " Norton looked closely and saw two or three faint pink blotches on Gabe 's wrist .  | " It never fails , " Gabe said . " When I get close to breaking a story , the spots start . Then , when I 'm really close , I break out in a rash . It 's a sixth sense I 've got . " Norton was speechless . " So do n't worry , buddy , " Gabe said . " We 're gon na get the bastards . We 're gon na nail them to the wall . " Gabe winked , gave Norton a friendly punch on the arm , and slipped out the door . Norton sighed , locked the door , turned off the radio , and went to the bathroom to take some vitamin C. He caught colds easily and he felt one coming on .  | 22 HE OPENED THE DOOR and she threw herself into his arms . " Careful , I 've got a cold , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said and kissed him , and she began to cry into his cashmere sweater . " Come on in , " Norton said . " Have you eaten ? I could scramble some eggs . " " No , thanks , " Penny said glumly . " I 'm not really hungry . " " How about a hot toddy ? I 'm living on hot toddies and Contac this week . " " Maybe just a Coke or something , " Penny said . " I 'm already in such trouble that I do n't want to drink booze or smoke grass or jaywalk or anything . " She tried to smile , but her face cracked and she began to cry again . He got her a Coke and joined her on the sofa . " Okay , Penny , tell me what the trouble is . " " I do n't even know what the trouble is , " she cried . " I met  | this guy on the plane and the next thing I know the cops are asking me questions and talking about the grand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm about to lose my mind ! " It all tumbled out at once , like the debris from Fibber McGee 's closet , and it frightened Norton . " Slow down , Penny . Start at the beginning . " She fumbled in her purse for a Virginia Slim . Her hands shook as she lit it . " I think it started on the plane , " she said . " The L.A. to Washington run . I was working the first-class cabin and I got to talking with this very peculiar guy . He came on strong about what a bigshot he was and all these adventures he 'd had . Finally I told him I thought he was putting me on , and he got all snippy and showed me a White House pass with his picture on it , so I guessed he was for real . " " Did he tell you his name ? " " He said his name was Wendell Baxter , but when he showed me his White House pass he kept his hand over the part with his name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So you figure it out . " Norton was n't even surprised . He was starting to think Gabe was right : the whole world was one vast conspiracy . " Penny , was he about forty-five and slender , with dark , hair cut short and kind of a wild look in his eyes ? " " How 'd you know ? " Her eyes were big as saucers . " It 's a long story . Tell me more about what he said . " " Well , he talked like he 'd been some kind of international spy . He talked about guns a lot . He said he had a gun that could shoot around corners , but I guess that was a joke . He talked about these private clubs where he gambled in London and he said he knew the Shah of Iran personally and he dropped the names of a lot of movie types . I guess that 's how we got to talking about Jeff . " " Jeff Fields ? " " That 's right . Like a dummy I said I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he picked up on that . Started asking me questions  | about Jeff and his parties until I changed the subject and then he went back to his snow job . " " Did he say what he was doing with a White House pass ? " " He said something about special assignments . He made it sound like he was doing them a favor . I mean , he was n't all that infatuated with President Whitmore . He got to talking about politics and how what the country needs is new leadership and Constitutionalist principles , ' whatever that means . It was wild to hear him talk . I mean , none of it made any sense at all  --  but I could n't take my eyes off the man . He was positively hypnotic . " She sipped at her Coke . " So anyway , when we landed at Dulles he asked me to dinner , and I did n't have anything better to do , so I said okay and we went to dinner at some Arab place , and the long and short @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he took me to some apartment , this grubby place on Capitol Hill , and instead of him trying to hustle me , which at least is what I expected , he starts asking me questions about Jeff and whether people use drugs at his parties . And I guess I told him everything I knew , just to shut him up . So sometime in the middle of the night he calls a cab and takes me to the friend 's house where I was staying . " " Penny , could you find that apartment again ? " " I do n't think so . You know how Capitol Hill all sort of looks alike . I guess I 'd know the place if I got inside it . " " I want us to take a walk around the Hill tomorrow to see if we can find that place . Okay ? " " Sure , Ben . " " So what happened next ? " " Nothing , for about a week . Then one morning I 'm at work , about to leave on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and flop out these silver badges and say they 're narcotics agents and I may be in trouble and they want to ask me some questions . And I say , Gee , fellows , I do n't know . I 've got this plane to catch . ' And they say maybe I want to check it with  | my boss first  --  real polite , like they were doing me a favor , but it sent me up the wall to think about my boss knowing there were two narcotics agents there to question me . " " They knew it would . " " I guess so . Anyway , I asked them what it was they wanted to talk about , and they started asking me about drugs , and did I use drugs and did I know other people who did . It was ridiculous . I said , Look , fellows , let 's face it , everybody smokes grass , everybody sniffs the happy powder . ' Honestly , Ben , half the stewardesses I know smoke a joint or snort some coke before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those fanny-pinching fools we have to take care of . But these two guys just kept on asking their questions and pretty soon they zero in on Jeff Fields and who uses drugs at his parties and where do they come from and all , until finally I told them I did n't want to talk any more . " Penny paused and finished her Coke . Norton sneezed and blew his nose . " You better have a toddy , " she said . " Maybe I could stand one too . " " Good idea , " he said . He went into the kitchen , heated the water , poured each of them two jiggers of Early Times into a coffee cup , filled the cups with boiling water , and added some honey and a couple of nutmegs . Penny tried her drink and grinned . " That 's good , " she said . " If I 'd just stuck to bourbon , I would n't be in this mess I 'm in . Or maybe I would , with my luck . " " Penny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't have to answer their questions ? That you could call a lawyer ? That anything you said could be used against you ? " " Well , not exactly . I mean , maybe one of them said something about how I did n't have to talk to them , and the other one broke in and said of course it 'd be better for me if I did , since I was already in so much trouble . I was all confused . One of them started talking about how awful prison was for a girl like me , and I guess I started crying a little , and the other  | one gets all friendly about how all they want is the truth and the truth never hurt anybody . " Norton groaned . " Penny , if a cop ever asks you what time it is , you tell him to talk to your lawyer . Please . " " I knew I should have called you , " she said . " But I flew to L.A. and had a few days out there and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I thought it 'd all go away . But when I got back to Washington , those same two guys were waiting for me and this time they said the U.S. Attorney wanted to see me . I just about dropped my teeth . I thought about calling you then , but they 'd already talked to my supervisor and he said I 'd better cooperate or I 'd be out of a job . And , you know , jobs are n't exactly growing on trees these days , and a lot of girls are having a hard time , so I figured the best thing I could do was to go see the U.S. Attorney . So I did . " " Frank Kifner ? " " You know him ? " " Yeah , " Norton said . " What 'd he say ? " " Well , he started out all warm and friendly , saying how wise I was to cooperate and how there were just a few little points to clear up , and then we 're back to playing Twenty Questions again . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Like he asked me if I used coke . Only to brush my teeth with , ' I said , but he did n't think that was funny . So he asks if people snort coke at Jeff 's parties . I said sure . Did Jeff do it ? Sure . But they kept trying to get me to say that it was Jeff 's coke and that maybe he sold it to people , and I told them I did n't know , and that 's when they started talking about the grand jury . I guess I started crying again , so finally they told me I could leave but they might be in touch . And then a few days later they called and said Kifner wanted to see me again . And that 's when I called you . That man  --  I could n't face him again . Ben , he 's got the coldest eyes I ever saw . " " God , I wish you 'd called me sooner . " " I 'm sorry , " she said . " I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just an average person who any halfway com-  | petent cop , much less a lawyer like Kifner , can tie up in knots . " " How much trouble am I in ? " " I do n't know . My guess is that they 're not interested in you . I think they wanted to build a case against Jeff Fields , to pressure him into doing a little favor for them , so they leaned on you and probably on some other people to get evidence against him . It 's called dealing up . ' They use the little guys to get the big guys . " " I do n't understand , " Penny said . " What did they want from Jeff ? " " I do n't know , " Norton said , although he was almost certain they had used the cocaine investigation to pressure Fields into telling him the story about getting Donna pregnant . " But why do they want to see me again ? " " I do n't know . Maybe they 're just going through the motions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a cheap political squeeze play . " Penny blinked in confusion . " You make it sound like blackmail ! " she said . " Like the government uses the laws to push people around , just like crooks use guns . Can they do that ? " " They do it every day , " he told her . " And the drug laws make it easy as pie for them . Just remember , Penny , every time you smoke a joint , much less use cocaine , you 're putting yourself at their mercy . And they do n't have a hell of a lot of it . " She shuddered and put her face in her hands . " It 's getting late , " he said . " Where are you staying ? " She looked up at him and tried to smile . " Nowhere , really . I mean , I could stay here , if you 've got room and all . " He shook his head . " I do n't think that 'd work , Penny . " " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Norton was starting to feel uncomfortable . " The thing is , Penny , that since the last time I saw you , I 've . . . well . . . " " You 've got a girl , " she said .  | " Yeah , more or less . It 's all happened sort of quick , but . . . " Penny grinned . " But she would n't exactly approve of me moving in with you . " " I think that 's a fair statement , " Norton said . " Look , maybe you could stay with her . She 's got a little house over in Foggy Bottom , not far from the Kennedy Center , and she 's got a spare bedroom . The thing is , I 'm going to talk to Kifner about you , and I do n't want you talking to anyone before I do . " " What 's her name ? " Penny asked . " Annie , " he told her . " Annie , " Penny repeated glumly . " I 'll bet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She put her face against the back of the sofa and started to cry . Norton touched her shoulder . " Listen , Penny , you 're wrong . You and Annie are a lot alike . You 're both honest . You 're both good people . You 'll get along fine . We 'll all three be friends . We 'll all three try to help each other . Okay ? " She turned and blinked at him , then hugged him tight . He held her for a moment , then he went to the phone and called Annie . She listened to his explanation and then said that if he did n't get Penny to her place within ten minutes she 'd break his neck .  | 23 CLAY MCNAIR was pondering a memo in which the White House chef pleaded for a 30 percent budget increase and hinted of rebellion among the kitchen help if he did n't get it , when Byron Riddle burst into the office , slammed the door behind him , and turned on the little Sony TV set on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Byron , if you do n't mind , I 'm trying to work , " he said . Riddle ignored the complaint . His eyes were fixed ron the television screen , where a fat woman was hopping up and down beside a new Dodge Charger . " Byron , I 'm working ! " " Take a break , pal , " Riddle said out of the side of his mouth . " Do n't you know what 's about to happen ? " McNair sighed and put aside the chef 's memo . " No , Byron , what is about to happen ? "  | " Donnie Ripley 's called himself a news conference , " Riddle said , with an air of smugness that mystified McNair . " A news conference ? What for ? It 's too early for him to announce for President . " " Ha ! " Riddle said , grinning fiendishly . " Let 's us just wait and see . " McNair shook his head in frustration . The political pundits were forever speculating whether Senator Ripley would challenge President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the question did not interest McNair at all . He expected to have returned to the relative sanity of corporate life by then . Furthermore , he did n't care who was President . He had decided that politicians were like toothpaste , products you advertised as uniquely different but that were in truth all the same . You merchandised your candidate to get him elected , and once he was elected you did his work for him . McNair was coming to see a certain fatal Catch-22 to the political process : the more talent a man had for getting himself elected to office , the less talent he would have for performing the duties of office . " Come on , damn it , come on , " Byron Riddle said impatiently . The television station was airing a seemingly endless series of commercials before the Senator 's news conference . At the moment a perky-looking older woman was advising a befuddled-looking younger woman of the virtues of a certain washday detergent . " If we had the right kind of government in this country , " Riddle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like that . " " Byron , we 've got to have advertising , " McNair protested . " It keeps the wheels turning . " " Listen , pal , what this country needs is to put some steel in people 's spines , not to sell soap , " Byron Riddle snapped . He groaned and began searching through his pockets for a cigarette . Finding none , he hurriedly unlocked his desk drawer and extracted a fresh pack of Marlboros . Just as he lit  | one , a can of dog food was replaced by the Capitol dome , then by the perplexed face of a well-known political commentator , who was saying , " . . . unexpected news conference has caught Washington by surprise . Veteran Washington watchers believe it is far too early for Senator Ripley to announce Presidential plans , yet that possibility remains . . . possible . And now we 're ready to switch to . . . " And there he was , Donovan Ripley , his imposing and rather weary face dominating the screen , the flag furled behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His wife was a gorgeous creature with strangely dazed eyes , like a debutante who has stumbled into a mine disaster . " My fellow Americans , " said Donovan Ripley , the hope of millions , every inch a President-to-be , " I am here this morning to announce a difficult decision , one I have reached after much prayer and much discussion with my beloved wife and the many friends who have encouraged my career of public service . . . " Clay McNair frowned and Byron Riddle let out a whoop of joy . " . . . and every public man must constantly weigh his duty to his country alongside his duty to those he holds most dear . . . " Byron Riddle was pounding his desk and rocking with silent laughter . " . . . the painful but necessary decision that , out of devotion to my beloved wife and children , I shall not now or at any time in the future be a candidate for President of the United States . . . " Riddle jumped to his feet and began dancing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the television screen there was similar chaos . The urbane political commentator was gasping like a fish out of water : " . . . political bombshell . . . totally unexpected . . . deep devotion to his family . . . completely alters the future of national politics . . . " " He did it , " Riddle shouted . " He 's out ! "  | McNair , annoyed , got up and turned off the TV . " Byron , let 's settle down . It 's not that big a deal , is it ? " " Not that big a deal ? " Riddle repeated and started laughing again until tears filled his eyes . " I 'd say it 's about as big a deal as I 've ever had a hand in . " " Had a hand in , Byron ? How is that ? " McNair thought his companion had taken leave of his senses . " Just a figure of speech , " Riddle said and pulled himself together . " I 've got to go now . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Murphy . See you later , McNair . " " Byron , what about those reports . . . ? " McNair began , but the other man raced from the office , slamming the door behind him . Clay McNair sighed and returned to his desk . This madness had gone on long enough . He did n't know what valuable services Riddle was performing for Ed Murphy or others in the White House , but all he was doing was disrupting McNair 's own work schedule . He would have to talk to Murphy . At the very least , Riddle had to move to another office . Enough was enough . McNair was reaching for the chef 's complaint again when something quite unexpected caught his eye . Riddle had left his desk drawer open . McNair was stunned . Riddle had always guarded those drawers like a tiger . He felt a sudden almost irresistible urge to see what was inside the drawer . No , he told himself , that would be beneath his dignity ; that was not the kind of thing an executive did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find something compromising , something that would strengthen his case with Ed Murphy , and he would do almost anything that would get Byron Riddle out of his office and out of his life . He crossed the office swiftly and pulled open the drawer . There was a carton of Marlboros inside . And a map of California . And two manila envelopes . McNair picked up the first one . It was sealed , and someone had written " D. H. Tape " across the front of it . McNair could feel the round spool of  | tape inside . D. H. Tape ? Who or what was D. H. ? Department of Housing ? David Halberstam ? McNair frowned , replaced the first envelope , and picked up the second one . This one was bulky and unsealed , and when McNair peered into it he was startled to find that it was full of money . Most of the bills were hundreds , with a few fifties scattered about . At a glance , McNair guessed there was at least ten thousand dollars in the envelope . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pound and he was thinking very fast . He thought of the financial sacrifice he was making to work in the government . He thought of the expense , more than five thousand dollars a year , of keeping his daughters in private schools . He thought of his wife 's complaints that he was working too hard , that they had n't taken a vacation in two years , and he thought how fine it would be if he could take his family to Acapulco or perhaps Caneel Bay for a week or two . If he could afford it . He reached into the envelope . Just two thousand , he thought . Twenty bills . Riddle would never notice . And what a fine vacation he and his family could have . Suddenly the door opened and Byron Riddle stepped into the office . McNair gasped and dropped the envelope . " You should n't have done that , McNair , " Riddle whispered . " You left the drawer open , " McNair said smoothly . " I was closing it for you . You ought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his boyish grin , but it faded quickly in the face of Riddle 's murderous stare . McNair shrugged and started back to his own desk . " Look , Byron , " he said , " I think it 's time you and I had a little talk . I 'm getting tired ? " Riddle 's fist shot out and sank into the pit of McNair 's stomach . McNair doubled up with pain and thought he was going to be sick . Riddle grabbed his Countess Mara tie , shoved him up against the wall , and slapped him hard across the face . McNair struggled to defend himself but Riddle judo-chopped him in the neck and his arms suddenly went limp .  | " Byron , for God 's sake , " he cried . Riddle slapped him again . " How 'd you get in that drawer ? " he demanded . " You left it open . " Riddle punched him in the stomach again and McNair sank to his knees . He 's going to kill me , he thought . This madman is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basement . " Byron , " he pleaded , " if we have a problem , let 's discuss it like ? " Riddle banged his head against the wall so hard that McNair thought he would pass out . " You want some money , punk ? " Riddle whispered savagely . " You like the money ? Okay , we 'll give you some money . " He reached into the envelope , pulled out a hundred-dollar bill , and stuck it in McNair 's face . " Eat it , punk ! " " What ? " " I said eat it ! " Riddle slapped him again and stuffed the bill into his mouth . " Chew it up . Swallow it . " McNair started to protest , but when Riddle raised his hand , as if to slap him again , McNair began to chew the bill . It tasted dirty , and he thought he was going to vomit . He started to cry . " Swallow it before I kill you , " Riddle said . McNair swallowed , gagged , then got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , staring sightlessly at the floor . " What 'd you see in that drawer ? " Riddle snapped . " Nothing , Byron . I swear . Please ? " Riddle kicked him in the ribs . " You 're a liar . What 'd you see ? " " The cigarettes . A map . Some money . " " What else ? " " An envelope . " " What 'd it say on it ? " " I do n't know . " Riddle kicked him again . " What 'd it say ? "  | " I swear to God I do n't know . " Riddle knelt down , whispering into his ear . " If you ever say anything to anybody about what was in that drawer , I 'll kill you . Do you read me ? " " Yes , Byron . " " I wo n't kill you fast . I 'll kill you slow . And your wife and kids too . You think I 'm kidding ? " " No , Byron , " McNair whispered . " Can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are . " " Byron , we ca n't go on like this , sharing an office ? " " That 's the first smart thing you 've said , " Riddle told him . " So you better tell Murphy you want to move out . Okay ? " " Okay , Byron . Anything you say . " " That 's more like it . You can get up now . " McNair struggled to his feet . Riddle leaned against his desk and lit a Marlboro . " I do n't like getting rough with you , " he said . " That 's not my style . But you got to understand I 'm doing some confidential assignments for the big boys and there ca n't be any leaks . So you just keep your mouth shut and we wo n't have any more problems . Right ? " " Right , " McNair said . His side throbbed where Riddle had kicked him . He thought he might have a broken rib . " And Byron . . . I 'm sorry I looked in your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a man , " Riddle said and suddenly extended his hand . Dazed , McNair shook hands with his tormentor . " There 's no reason for us to have problems , " Riddle said . " You 're a team player , McNair , and there 's a place for your kind . But Byron Riddle 's a lone wolf , out there on his own , doing the tough jobs that nobody else wants to do . And from now on the best thing you can do is stay out of my way . " " I agree , " McNair said . " Good ! Now , turn around and face the wall . " " What ? " " You heard me . Turn around . Fast ! "  | McNair turned around , fast , and heard the sounds of Riddle opening his desk drawers and removing their contents and putting them into his briefcase . " So long , McNair , " he said after a minute . " Remember what I said . Keep your lip buttoned and you 'll be okay . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw that Riddle was gone , and quickly locked the door . As if any lock could protect him from Byron Riddle . He slumped down at his desk , throbbing with pain , trying to decide what to do . He would have to tell Ed Murphy . He could n't go on working with a maniac who 'd threatened to kill him . And yet . . . what if all Riddle said was true ? What if he was working on confidential projects for Ed Murphy or even for the President ? What if he told them McNair had somehow compromised their secrecy ? What if , instead of getting Riddle fired , he got himself fired ? If that happened , all his plans would go up in smoke . No corporation would give him the kind of job he wanted . Maybe it was better to keep quiet , to move to another office and keep away from Byron Riddle , even if it meant leaving the White House for the limbo of the Executive Office Building next door . That might be best , just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't help wondering . Why was Riddle so upset ? What was so important about those two envelopes ? D. H. Tape . Donna Hendricks Tape . It hit him all at once and left him limp with fear . What did Riddle have to do with the dead woman ? What kind of tape ? What secrets could be on that tape that would inspire a threat of murder ? McNair was starting to think thoughts he did not want to think . All he wanted was to do his job , to please his bosses , to get ahead in the world . But now , somehow , he was dealing with a madman who had threatened to kill him and his family . McNair put his face in his hands . His ribs ached where Riddle had kicked him and he had a queasy feeling in the pit of his stomach . He wondered what germs  | might have been on that bill . Perhaps he should see a doctor . But how would he explain having swallowed a hundred-dollar bill ? McNair 's telephone began to ring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to talk to anyone . He wished he was far away from Washington , D.C. He almost wished he was dead .  | 24 THEY ARGUED on the way to the airport . " You ca n't trust Gabe Pincus , " she said . " I do n't trust him , " he told her . " But I need him . " " He 'll screw you , " Annie said . " All he cares about is his scoops . His name in lights . You ca n't control him . " " He 's useful . Half of what I know about this mess came from Gabe . " " And how much do you know ? So much that now you 're flying off to California on a wild-goose chase ? " " Annie , it 's all I know to do , " he said wearily . " There 's got to be a weak link somewhere . McNair wo n't talk to me . Riddle has vanished . So I 'm going to try Jeff Fields again . " " You could go public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Lay out everything you know . Then let them explain it , instead of beating your head against a wall like this . " He turned off the Beltway onto the Dulles Access Road and shook his head stubbornly . " I 'm not ready to do that yet . It  | could destroy Whitmore and I wo n't do that until I 'm sure he was involved in Donna 's death . " " Sure ? How sure can you be ? " she cried . " You know he got her pregnant . You know somebody killed Senator Nolan . You know they pressured Fields into claiming he got her pregnant . What do you want , a confession ? " A taxi whizzed past them at eighty miles an hour . " Some poor bastard late for his plane , " Norton said . " Look , I tried to explain last night , all those things could be coincidence . The case against Whitmore is still circumstantial . There 's a line between what I suspect and what I know . If I were a juror @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a reasonable doubt that Whitmore was involved . " " Oh God , " she cried . " Lawyers . " When he stopped the car in front of the airport he took her hand . " I 'll call you tonight , " he said . " Get some rest out there , " she said . " Lie by the pool for a while and soak up some sun . " " I 'll try to , " he said . " Look , I 'm really sorry about last night . " She scooted across the seat and kissed him . " I loved last night , " she said . " Just get some rest . I 'm going to eat you up when you get back . " He kissed her quickly and hurried into the terminal . When his plane lifted off the runway a half hour later , Norton thought he 'd never been so glad to leave a place as he was to leave Washington now . Even if it meant leaving Annie . For the past week or so he had felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noticing people on the street whose faces had only been blurs to him before . Now he imagined them watching him , following him , conspiring against him . He assumed all phones were tapped , all mail was opened , all conversations were overheard . The last straw had come the night before , when he and Annie had gone to bed together for the first time . And that  | was all they had done , gone to bed , for something maddening had happened to him . Impotence , it seemed , was one of the final symptoms of paranoia . In bed , with her arms around him , her thin body warm against his , he heard sounds outside the door , saw shadows at the windows , imagined spies , hidden cameras , secret microphones . It was too much . She tried to help , but it only got worse . Finally he gave up and , hoping to make her understand , told her what was troubling him . Of course , even as he whispered to her about Donna 's death , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the conspiracy , but he had to trust someone . Once he began talking , she sat up in the bed , switched on the light , and cross-examined him for an hour . She thought he was being too cautious , too trusting . She had no doubt of Whitmore 's complicity . But of course she was ten crucial years younger than he was . He had come of age trusting his government , and she had not . Finally , when all her questions were answered , she 'd switched off the light and put her arms around him and held him close . He fell asleep half in love with her . " Would you like a cocktail , sir ? " He opened his eyes . The stewardess was blue-eyed and pert . He thought of Penny and wondered if this stewardess might also be stoned . " Two Bloody Marys , please , " he told her . He had a plan : to drink two Bloody Marys and sleep all the way to California . The flat-faced man was still guarding Jeff Fields 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The boss is expecting you , " he said a bit sullenly . " Down by the pool . " Norton parked his rented Ford in front of the mansion , beside a sparkling canary yellow Jaguar , and walked around the house and down the long lawn that sloped toward the pool . It was not like before , when partygoers had cavorted in and around the pool . Now there was only Jeff Fiefs , lying on  | a chaise beside the pool , and a big white rubber raft bobbing gently on its surface . " Hello , Norton , " the actor said without getting up . " Hello , Jeff . I appreciate the hospitality . " " I owed you some , after last time . Just do n't give me any more nonsense about coming out here to talk about a job . How about a beer ? " " Great . " " I 'll get them , " Fields said . " There 's a refrigerator in the cabana . " He went into the cabana and returned a minute later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are n't you , Norton ? " he asked . " Sure . North Carolina . " " Do you say refrigerator or icebox ? " " I grew up saying icebox . We had one . Literally , a box you put ice in . Sometimes I still catch myself saying it . Why do you ask ? " I made a picture once that was set in Mississippi in the thirties . I had a hell of a time convincing the director I should say icebox . " " I saw that picture . You played the bootlegger . You were good too . I used to get so damn tired of seeing pictures about the South starring people with Brooklyn accents . The kind of people who think you all ' is singular . " Fields smiled . " It 's plural , is n't it ? You all shore been right nice tuh me . ' I 'll have to remember that . " " Look , Jeff , I was pretty rude to you that time in Lafayette Square . The problem was , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get right to it , do you want me to tell you what I think 's happening here ? " " Sure . Fire away . " " To begin with , I do n't for a minute believe you got Donna pregnant . I think Whitmore did and they pressured you to come to me with your song and dance . The only thing I  | could n't figure out is how they could make you do something so dumb . " " Why dumb ? " " Why ? In the first place , it 's always dumb to involve yourself in a murder case if you do n't have to . Besides that , if you told your story under oath , and it could come to that , you 'd be running the risk of perjury . Whenever you lie for somebody else , Jeff , there 's always the chance they 'll decide to tell the truth and leave you way out on a limb . " The actor shrugged and began rubbing suntan lotion on his chest . " I could n't figure how they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then the other night a stewardess named Penny came to see me . Remember her ? " " Yeah . " " Well , the U.S. Attorney 's office put the screws to her until she told them everything she knew about drug use at your parties . And I figure they did the same with some other people too , until they got enough evidence for some kind of a cocaine charge . Was that it ? Is that how they turned you around ? " " Let me tell you something , Norton . Just hypothetically . The government would n't have to convict someone like me to ruin them . They might not even have to indict me . They could probably ruin me just by leaking certain evidence to the papers . Actor Accused in Cocaine Plot . ' Wild Orgies at Actor 's Estate . ' Stuff like that . A cocaine charge today would do to my career what a marijuana charge did to Bob Mitchum thirty years ago . " " So you think they 've got you cold ? " " Do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making a hell of a mistake . " " Look , Norton , if you ever repeat what I 'm about to tell you , I 'll deny it . But you 're not far off the mark . They did ask their little favor and I said no , and the next thing I knew they had an army of narcotics agents talking to my friends . So I  | talked to my lawyer and his advice was four words : Do what they say . And I did . And that was the end of the cocaine investigation . So maybe I was n't so dumb after all . " " Hey , boss . " It was the flat-faced man calling from the terrace . " I 'm going to town . You want anything ? " " Get more beer , " Fields yelled back . The man waved and disappeared . " Just you and him now , Jeff ? " Norton asked . " No gorgeous babes ? No music ? No parties ? " " The party 's over , " Fields said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lawyer 's wrong . " " He 's wrong because he 's letting you get into trouble you do n't have to get into . He 's underestimating your position . Sure , you 're vulnerable , but so is Whitmore . He can hurt you , but you can hurt him too , and he 's got even more to lose . " " It 's a no-win situation . " " What you 're doing is a no-win situation . Look , I think you know something about Donna 's affair with Whitmore , and why she went to Washington to see him , and maybe about how she died . And if you know even half of that , there 's no reason for you to let them push you around . They 're the ones in trouble , not you . You did n't kill anybody . Why let them drag you into a cover-up ? " " Damn it , because they can ruin me . " " Other people could get ruined too . Do you know who Frank Kifner is ? " " Yeah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drug investigation ? " " One of his assistants did . " " Okay . I 'm going to see Kifner when I get back to Washington and I 'm going to tell him that I know that he 's been putting the screws to Penny for no good reason except political pressure from the White House . And that he 's been doing the same thing to you . They ca n't do that , Jeff . They ca n't just walk over people with impunity . They ca n't use the judicial process to blackmail people . Frank Kifner 's a smart , ambi-  | tious man , and he 's going to listen to me . He 's got to look out for his own interests , and what I want to do is convince him that it 's in his interest to get the truth about Donna 's death . And you 're one of the people I 'm going to urge him to talk to . And I hope you 'll get smart and tell him the truth . " Fields got slowly to his feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about another beer ? " he asked . " Sure . " Fields returned with two more Coors and handed Norton one . " Look , let me ask you a couple of questions . " " Go ahead . " " Why are you telling me all this ? That you think Whitmore got her pregnant and knows who killed her ? That you 're going to see Kifner about it ? Are n't you afraid I 'll call Whitmore or Ed Murphy or whoever 's behind all this and tell them what you 've said ? " " I 've talked to Murphy . He knows what I think . Right now we 're playing poker . They 're betting I ca n't prove I 'm right and I 'm betting I can . And you 're in the middle . " Fields got up and moved his chaise farther away from the cabana . It was midafternoon and the palm trees were beginning to cast long shadows across the lawn . Norton stayed in the shade . " Ben , do n't you ever feel that you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up against controls the police and the FBI and the U.S. Attorney 's office , and there 's no way you can crack through that wall ? Are n't you gambling  --  and asking me to gamble  --  on one hell of a long shot ? " " Sure I 've felt like that , " he said . " I 've been in Washington long enough to know just how screwed up and corrupt the political system can be . But the thing is , Jeff , deep down inside I believe in our system . I think of it as being like an old mule . It 's lazy and stubborn and selfish and stupid  --  but the damned thing can work ! If you just kick it in the ass enough , you can make it work . That 's all I 'm trying to do , just trying to kick ass until I get that old mule moving in the right direction . "  | " What if the mule kicks back , Ben ? " " Let it kick . I 'm just as stubborn as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think there are people who want to shut you up and if they ca n't discourage you one way they 'll do it another way . If I were you , I 'd be careful where I went and who I turned my back on . I had a friend once , a director , who crossed the Mafia . A small thing , a gambling debt , eight or ten thousand dollars . The cops found him stuffed in a garbage can behind the Brown Derby with eighty-three icepick holes in him . " " We 're not dealing with the Mafia , Jeff . " " No ? What about that old Senator ? Do you think he fell off that cliff accidentally ? " " I do n't know , " Norton admitted . " I 'd like to think he did . " Fields laughed bitterly . " Then do n't call me dumb , pal . You may be dumber than I am . If that 's possible . " " Maybe so , " Norton said . " We 'll find out eventually . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not you 're going to cooperate with me . I want to know who at the White House told you to tell me that story . And why Donna went to Washington . And what you know about her death . All of it . What do you say ? " Fields crumpled his beer can in half and flung it into the air . It landed in the grass and lay sparkling in the sun . " Damn it , I do n't know what to do , " he said . " Just tell the truth , Jeff . You ca n't go wrong telling the truth . " The actor almost smiled . " You know something funny ? I believe in Whitmore . I think that if anybody can straighten out this screwed-up country , he 's the one . The last thing 1 want to do is cause him problems . " " I feel the same way , " Norton said . " But we did n't cause his problems . He caused his own . You 've got to think about your own interests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his . " Fields got up and began to pace beside the pool . " God  | damn it , " he said . " I did n't ask for any of this . It 's not my problem . If it just was n't for that damn tape . " Norton froze . " What tape , Jeff ? " he said softly . The actor stopped pacing and seemed to come out of his trance . " What ? Oh , nothing . Forget it . " " Jeff , what tape ? What are you talking about ? " Fields sat on the end of the chaise with his head in his hands . " I ca n't talk now , " he muttered . " I 've got to think . I 've got to talk to my lawyer . I do n't know what to do ! " " There is n't much time , " Norton said . " I go back to Washington tomorrow . I need to know which way you 're going to jump . " " Come by at nine in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make up my mind by then . " Norton stood up , then made one last try . " The tape , Jeff . Just tell me what you meant by that . " " In the morning , " the actor repeated , and Norton gave up . He started up the hill , then stopped beside the mansion and gazed back down at the pool . Fields had gone in for a swim . After a lap or two , he had climbed onto the white raft that had been bobbing in the water , and now he was lying on his back , eyes shut , drifting about the pool like a man perfectly at peace . It was a pleasing sight : the lean tanned young man floating on the white raft atop the turquoise water , with the cabana and the palm trees and the mountains and the endless desert sky for his backdrop . Norton thought the vista would have made a nice ending for a movie , if movies had nice endings any more . Fields opened his eyes , saw Norton , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ canoe , Jeff ? " Norton called down the hill . " Maybe , " the actor called back . " Or maybe I 'm just up Shit Creek without a paddle . " Or maybe both , Norton thought , and he waved and walked around the house to his car .  | 25 BACK AT HIS HOTEL , Norton ducked into the bar , ordered a gin and tonic , and asked the bartender if he would turn on the evening news . Norton was of course a news addict ; any night he missed Walter Cronkite he began to shake and sweat like a junkie without his fix . The bartender gave him an odd stare , but switched on the huge color television set above the bar . No one else in the dark little barroom seemed remotely interested in the news , and Norton noticed a few people seeming to frown at him . The news that evening was mostly from Washington and was all bad . Prices up , employment down , food scarce , experts baffled . Another Congressman had been indicted for tax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The State Department warned of new violence in the Middle East , the Pentagon wanted more money , and the Treasury hinted at another tax increase . As more and more bad news flowed out  | of the television set , Norton began to feel uncomfortable , began to see the news from a new , disturbing non-Washington perspective . In Washington he accepted the nation 's political woes as part of everyday life , like the smog in Los Angeles . Moreover , he and most of the people he knew made their livings off the nation 's political agonies , one way or another . But here in this posh little bar in this desert paradise , Washington 's ill tidings seemed cruelly out of place . He saw people up and down the bar beginning to grumble and shoot angry glances his way , and he thought suddenly , startlingly , How they must hate us ! Hemingway called Paris a moveable feast , but Washington was a moveable disaster , each night sending its message of gloom and doom across a helpless and uncomprehending land . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the bartender asked . " Some folks want to see the golf tournament . " " Good idea , " Norton said , and Walter Cronkite was abruptly replaced by the comforting sight of Johnny Miller sinking a thirty-foot putt . A collective sigh filled the barroom , and even Norton felt relieved . The next morning Jeff Fields emerged from his mansion just as Norton parked his rented Ford beside the actor 's Jaguar . Norton walked over and met the actor at the foot of the steps . Fields was wearing sneakers , white linen pants , and a lime green sport shirt , and he looked nervous and distracted . " Morning , Jeff . " The actor looked at him and laughed . " Ben , you look like hell . " " I did n't sleep well , " Norton admitted . " I lay there until dawn trying to make sense of this mess . You do n't look so great either . " The actor plunged his hands in his pants pockets and stared glumly at the driveway , kicking absently at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said . " Just when I 'd made up my mind what to do , this very strange thing happened . " " What ? " " Look , I 'm going to level with you , as far as I can . You made sense yesterday . Last night , after you left , I called my lawyer and we talked a long time . Then I called somebody in Washington  --  I 'm not going to say who  --  and we talked too . And finally I decided you were right , that I ought to tell the U.S. Attorney the truth about this mess and let the chips fall where they may . " " Great , " Norton said . " Then , just now , ten minutes ago , this thing happened , " Fields said . " I got a phone call from the commander of the army base just outside of town . He said I had to get over there immediately , that I had a call from the White House . " " What the hell , " Norton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't they call you here ? " " The implication was that it was the President calling and he wanted the call on a secure phone  --  which the phone at the army base is and my phone is n't . " " So you 're going ? " " What else can I do ? " " Jeff , even if it is the President , nothing he can say can change anything . " " Maybe not . But I have to talk to him , just as a courtesy . " " I guess you do , " Norton said . " But do n't let them snow you . Your position is very simple : you 're going to tell the truth . Do n't listen to any of this jazz about how Western civilization will collapse if Chuck Whitmore gets involved in a scandal . That 's their problem . " " I guess so , " the actor said uncertainly . " Another thing , " Norton said . " I guess I 'm a little slow this morning , but why is this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only thing I can figure is that after I talked last night to my lawyer  --  he 's in Los Angeles  --  and to my contact in  | Washington , one of them called the White House and told them what I was about to do . That 's the hell of it , Ben . They hold all the cards . No matter what you do , they 're one step ahead of you . " " Do n't think that way , " Norton said . " Do n't let the bastards get you down . " " Look , I might as well get this call over with . It 's about a twenty-minute drive to the base . Do you want to come with me ? " Norton threw up his hands . " I do n't know . I guess so . " " I do n't guess there 'll be any trouble getting you in , " Fields said . " It 's some sort of a communication center . Top secret stuff . Come on , we 'll take the Jag . " They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Norton stopped . " Jeff , I missed breakfast , and if it 's all the same with you I 'll stay here and have some coffee . " " Suit yourself , " the actor said . " Everything you need 's in the kitchen . Try a Bloody Mary too . " " Just coffee and eggs , " Norton said . " That 's what I need . " " Okay , see you in an hour or so . Keep your chin up . " The actor grinned , skipped across the driveway , and slipped gracefully into the Jaguar . The engine started the first time and purred gently as Fields buckled his seat belt . Then he waved a jaunty goodbye and the car shot forward along the driveway . Norton , watching from the steps , smiled at the picture before him : the actor 's perfect profile , the bold lines of the Jaguar , the freshly watered lawn sparkling in the morning sun , an instant of almost perfect beauty , and then he was falling backward as the picture exploded into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the mansion . A cloud of smoke drifted up over the lawn . Beneath it , what had been the yellow Jaguar was a knot of charred , twisted metal with fingers of flame leaping up from it . The man in the gatehouse shouted something and began running toward the ruined car . Norton picked himself up and started forward , then stopped when he noticed something small and pinkish white in the  | driveway . He bent down and saw it was a thumb . He stumbled toward the house and vomited into a flowerbed . Then he made himself go inside and call the police . The Palm Springs detectives were n't finished with Norton until midafternoon . He told them he 'd come to see Fields about a job . He also told them about the mysterious call from the army base , and by the time he left the police station the detectives had established at least one fact : there had been no call from the White House to the army base and no call from the army base to Fields . Norton was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evening , but certain facts were starting to fall into place . The bomb had been put in the car overnight ; Fields 's bodyguard told the police that the Jaguar had been driven the previous afternoon . That meant that somehow the killer had found out overnight that Fields intended to tell the truth about Donna 's death . How ? Maybe he 'd called the wrong people for advice . And who was his mysterious Washington contact ? Or maybe his phone had been tapped . However they 'd found out , someone had slipped in and planted that bomb . And then there 'd been the phony phone call at nine in the morning , timed to come just as Norton arrived , calculated to be the one message that would make Fields drop everything and hop into his Jaguar . Norton was shaken , dazed , as he boarded his plane . Donna 's death might have been unintended . Senator Nolan 's could have been an accident . But Fields 's death was carefully planned , cold-blooded murder . And something else : the more he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the murderer had intended for him to be blown to bits along with the unlucky actor .  | 26 NORTON CLIMBED OUT of the cab and splashed through the puddles that dotted the vast expanse of concrete in front of the federal courthouse . As water soaked his shoes and rain drenched his head and shoulders , he cursed himself for not wearing a raincoat that morning , but in truth he almost never paid attention to the weather in Washington . It had been different back home in North Carolina . There , the coming of rain meant picnics and hayrides canceled , baseball games postponed , football games played in the mud ; and he had watched the sky many nights to see what havoc the elements might play on his young life . But Washington was different . He thought of Washington as a city without weather . Washington had moods instead of weather  --  the political commentators were its true weathermen . The mood of Washington tonight is calm . The mood of Washington tonight is tense . The mood of Washington tonight is pessimistic . Moods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waves .  | Political weather , with the barometer always falling . Safely inside the courthouse , he asked the guard where Frank Kifner 's office was . It was not the easiest of questions to answer , for Kifner shed offices the way a snake sheds skins , and each new office was always bigger and more imposing than the last . He had been a Supreme Court clerk , a Senator 's legislative aide , a star of the Watergate Special Prosecutor 's team , an assistant U.S. Attorney , and now the U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia . And that was not the end of the line , not at all , for Kifner had ambitions to match his abilities . The private practice of law still lay ahead of him , and perhaps politics after that . It was an interesting progression . This year he would make his name by putting men into prison so that next year he could make his fortune by keeping other men out of prison . Then someday he might go on the bench , where he could do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rules of the game . Norton found the proper office , announced himself to an efficient black secretary , and moments later was ushered into Kifner 's large , rather austere office . Kifner greeted him with a limp handshake and a cold stare . He was a small man with thinning hair and rimless glasses who gave off an aura of absolute precision . " I 'm glad you called , Ben , " he began . " We 've been trying to reach you . " " I was in California for a couple of days . " " I know . We 've had reports from the Palm Springs police . " " Do you want to talk about that ? " " Let 's settle your business first . You 're representing Miss Carr ? " " That 's right . And I 'm as confused as Penny is . Is she the subject of an investigation ? If so , what 's its status ? I want transcripts of your interviews with her . And I 'd like to know why you never advised her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loose with this girl , Frank . "  | Kifner was unruffled . His fingers tapped the top of his desk impatiently and his eyes stayed fixed on Norton , seeming never to blink . " She was advised of her rights , " he said . " The status of the investigation is that it 's closed , so far as she 's concerned . If you want the transcripts , tell my secretary . " You bastard , you 're like a computer , Norton thought , clickclick-click , making punch cards out of people 's lives . " The investigation is closed ? " Norton said . " Closed because Jeff Fields got himself blown up ? " " Closed . " " Not as far as I 'm concerned , " Norton said . " You people put the screws to my client for no good reason , except whatever political games you 're playing . " Kifner stared back at him with a detachment that was very close to contempt . Somehow the expression reminded Norton of Whitney Stone . " Your client is an admitted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There are millions of ? " " Who admits attending parties where large amounts of cocaine were in view . Our investigation involved some major West Coast drug dealers . " " So you zero in on Jeff Fields , whose last picture made eight million dollars . He 's dealing ? " " He was one link in the chain of evidence . " Norton chewed at his lower lip and wondered if Kifner really believed the things he was saying . " Do n't you know what 's going on , Frank ? " he asked . Kifner glanced impatiently at his watch , like a man who was living his life five minutes behind schedule instead of five years ahead of schedule . " Why do n't you enlighten me ? " he said . " To begin with , Donna Hendricks was three months pregnant when she died . I assume you know that . And old Senator Nolan told me that Whitmore visited her in Carmel in January , three months before her death . I think they 'd been having an affair and he got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to talk to him when she was killed . And I think he or maybe Ed Murphy knows something about who killed her . All I can get from Ed is a runaround . Jeff Fields came to me a few weeks ago and said he 'd been having an affair with Donna and had gotten her pregnant . This did n't make much sense , then I talked to Penny and found out about this drug investigation and realized it was all intended to put pressure on Fields to make him tell me he 'd gotten Donna pregnant . He admitted as much to me the night before he was killed . So what I 'm suggesting , Frank , is that you 'd better start worrying less about airline stewardesses who use cocaine and more about whether Fields and Senator Nolan were killed because they knew too much about Donna 's death . " " All three deaths are under investigation , " Kifner said calmly . " Yeah ? Who 's in charge ? You or Ed Murphy ? " Kifner 's eyes narrowed but his expression never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any , Ben . " " Help me ? Frank , have n't you listened to what I 've said ? Do n't you realize what 's going on ? " " Our investigation is progressing , " Kifner said . " I 'm not obliged to give you all the details . " Kifner looked at his watch again . Norton was starting to feel desperate . " Frank , do you know who Byron Riddle is ? " " I know who he is , yes . " " Have you questioned him ? " " I 'm not going to comment on that . " " Well , you damn well better question him , because that guy keeps turning up everywhere . He set Penny up on that drug rap  --  do n't bother to deny it . I caught him spying on me one night . Someone who fit his description visited Senator Nolan not long before he was killed . And I 'll bet my last dollar he was in Palm Springs when Fields got blown up . " " Do you have any proof @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 're the one in a position to get proof .  | There are all these loose ends and it 's your job to tie them together . " " Do you have any more advice for me , Ben ? " " Yeah , I do . Get on top of this thing before it blows up in your face . Maybe the White House has been conning you , but now you 've been warned . Question Ed Murphy , and Riddle , and maybe McNair and Galiano too . Get them on record , under oath . Maybe somebody will break . Maybe there 's an innocent answer for all this . Maybe the President is in the dark  --  he may well be  --  and you ought to take it straight to him . It 's your move , Frank . Everything I 've told you I 'll repeat under oath , but the ball 's in your court now . " Kifner 's fingertips drummed against the top of his desk . There was no other sound in the office . " I think I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said finally . " Although it would certainly be easier if I had your remarkable powers of persuasion . People always seem to tell you the truth . Senator Nolan tells you about this mysterious assignation that no one else knows about . Jeff Fields tells you about mysterious pressures from the White House . Then they both conveniently die , and only you are left knowing the truth . Everyone else in the world seems to be crooked , Ben , except you . " Norton stood up . " Okay , Frank , I wo n't waste any more of your time . I thought you were trying to do an honest job . " " Sit down , Ben . " " I do n't want to sit down . But let me leave you with one parting thought . I know about the tape . Fields told me about it the night before he died . " Kifner 's fingers stopped drumming on the desk and he sat perfectly still for a moment , like a poker player trying to decide whether to call a bluff . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said at last . But Norton could not push the bluff any further . You could n't bluff a man who had the power to subpoena evidence . " No , " he admitted . " No , I do n't know where it is . Yet . "  | " Sit down , Ben . " " I 've said all I have to say . I could give you details , but you obviously do n't want my details . " " Sit down . You may be finished , but I 'm not . " Norton lowered himself back into his chair . " Whether you choose to believe it or not , Ben , we have an investigation of Miss Hendricks 's death in progress . Sergeant Kravitz , the detective in charge of the investigation , is just as anxious to see the case solved as you are . Perhaps more so . Kravitz has had a breakthrough in the investigation . And since you 've been so generous with your information , I think I should share our new information with you . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made Norton uneasy . " We have a witness , " Kifner continued , " who claims to have seen someone leaving the house on Volta Place around midnight on the night Miss Hendricks was murdered . " " Who is your witness ? " Norton asked . " I 'm not going to identify the witness , " Kifner said . " But I am going to tell you who he claims to have seen leaving the house that night . " " Okay , who was it ? " " You , Ben . "  | 27 GABE WAS STRETCHED OUT full-length on Norton 's sofa with a tumbler of Scotch balanced on his belly . As he talked , he was alternately running his hand through his dandruff-filled hair and scratching dead skin from his mottled forearms . " We 're getting close , " he said fervently . " My rash is starting . " " Getting close ? " Norton said glumly . " Gabe , I got close to being blown to bits the other morning . It was pure dumb luck that I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's safe for me to go out on the street any more . " " Nobody 's gon na kill you in Washington , " Gabe said , flicking his stubby fingers so that scraps of dead skin fluttered to the floor . " It 's just out in the field that they pull stunts like that . Some guy bucking for a promotion , trying to impress the home office . Just think , if you 'd got blown up some up-andcoming spook would have made GS-12 . Back here in Wash-  | ington the boys are more sophisticated . They do n't plant bombs , they plant ideas  --  that 's the way to really work a guy over . " " You 're right about that , " Norton said . " My old pal Frank Kifner planted some ideas with me the other morning that have just about driven me up the wall . " " Like what ? " " Well , he might have a perjury count against me , which I knew already . And then he claimed to have a witness who saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was killed . " Gabe laughed so explosively that his drink spilled onto his pants leg . He cursed and grabbed the glass , managing in the process to knock his ashtray onto the floor . By the time he rearranged himself his smile had vanished and he stared at Norton with narrowed eyes . " Did you ? " he said sharply . " Did I what ? " " Did you come out of the house that night , you dummy ? " Norton groaned with disbelief . " No , I did n't come out of the house that night . I did n't kill her , if that 's what you 're thinking . " The reporter shrugged and pulled at his wet pants leg . " Stranger things have happened , " he muttered . " The thing is , " Norton continued , " that Kifner would n't tell me who his witness is . If there really is one . I mean , he could be bluffing . " " He 's not bluffing , " Gabe said . He lit a Lucky and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 'd spilled onto the floor . " How do you know he 's not bluffing ? " " Because I know who his witness is . " " Who , for Christ 's sake ? " " Joey Smallwood . " " The crazy kid in the liquor store ? " " That 's him . He 's a professional window peeper , always prowling around Georgetown at night , and they 've got him  | claiming he was across the street and saw you coming out . " " Some witness , " Norton said bitterly . " You 'd think they 'd do better than that . " " They do n't have to , " Gabe said . " Sure , Joey 's too nutty for his testimony to hold up in court , but they can ruin you just with the scandal . Or maybe they do bring a perjury charge and maybe they make it stick . You get disbarred , maybe do a year or two in the slammer , and by that time nobody 's gon na listen to what you say about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , pal . " Norton got up and poured them both another drink . Gabe stretched out on the sofa again , blowing smoke rings toward the ceiling and scratching his arms . His left wrist had begun to bleed and he licked the blood away occasionally . " I 've got a theory about this case , " Gabe said after a while . " I have n't got all the details pinned down yet , but it 's coming . " " Let 's hear it . " " To start with , you have to assume Whitmore or Murphy or somebody else in their inner circle zapped Donna . Otherwise , all this cover-up does n't make any sense . So , what they need is a fall guy , and it looks like you 've been elected . " " Why me ? " " Why not you ? It makes sense  --  the jilted lover and all that . That 's what that phone call to you telling you Donna was dead was all about . To make you do exactly what you did  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . " " Who do you think called me ? " " My guess would be Riddle . He 's up to his ears in this thing . But  --  and here 's where things get complicated  --  then Joey comes along . The nutty kid who waited on her in the liquor store and maybe followed her home or something . Joey , not having a law degree , or even much sense , figures to be an even better fall guy than you , so I figure they change strategies in midstream . Frame Joey . " " Then why have they now got Joey saying I did it ? " " Because , one , he 's got an All-American Mom who swears  | he was home that night , and , two , you 're such a pain in the ass they figure they 'll shut you up . " " Okay , Gabe , but if they 're trying to frame me for the murder , why did they try to blow me up the other day ? Or does n't your theory extend that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Gabe admitted . " Somebody might have figured that it 'd be easier to frame you if you were dead . In absentia , so to speak . " Gabe took a swallow of his drink and then chewed at a hangnail for a minute . " Or , " he said finally , " it could be that there 's one bunch trying to frame you and another bunch trying to kill you . You never want to underestimate the fuck-up factor when you 're dealing with the government . " They sat in silence for a moment , Gabe chewing on his hangnail , Norton pondering his uncertain future . " One thing I 'm wondering , " he said after a moment , " is whether Joey really saw somebody coming out of the house and honestly thought it was me . " " Use your head , " Gabe said scornfully . " All that kid saw was the light . Either he puts you at the scene or they put him at the scene . Even a loony can figure that out , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how Gabe knew who the witness was , but he knew better than to inquire about his sources . He had an idea it was Sergeant Kravitz . The week before , Gabe had written a long feature article about Kravitz that portrayed him as the very model of a resourceful homicide investigator , and Norton knew that Gabe , like most political reporters , rarely flattered anyone in public life without a quid pro quo . " You know , it 's damned interesting that Kifner told me about this witness at all . Under the rules of evidence , you do n't have to tell a defendant about a witness against him until his trial starts . So it 's like Frank was doing me a favor . " " I do n't trust the bastard , " Gabe said . " I do n't either , but I trust his sense of self-interest . I told him enough about Donna and Whitmore to shake him up , I  | hope . He 's got to be thinking about what happens to him if this thing breaks the wrong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reporter said . " This thing could break fast . Any day now . Because ever since Fields got himself blown up , some reporters have started putting two and two together . I figure in a week or so somebody might write a story asking if Donna 's death and Fields 's death and Senator Nolan 's death were n't connected . And they might toss you in as the link connecting all three of them . They might even have the bit about Joey seeing you leave the scene . Except they 're not going to break it , I am . I 'll hold off as long as I can , but I 'm not gon na get beat on this . " Norton sighed wearily . " Damn it , Gabe , I do n't understand how the media works . After Jeff Fields got killed , I figured every reporter in the country would link his death up with Donna 's and the whole thing would start to unravel . Instead , I pick up this morning 's paper and there 's this idiot story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case . . . unpaid gambling debt . . . mob-style execution . . . blahblah-blah . ' I could n't believe it . " " Why not ? " Gabe said . " That 's all the Mafia is , a whipping boy for the FBI and the CIA to use when they get theirselves in a jam . " " It 's what ? " " Look , Billy Blue-eyes , the Mafia ai n't nothing but a figment of J. Edgar Hoover 's imagination . Him and his PR-boys took a couple of hundred pot-bellied lowlife Eye-talian hoods and pimps and bootleggers and blew them up into the International Crime Syndicate , which they then informed a trembling nation was second only to International Godless Communism as a threat to Home , Flag and Mother . Hell , the FBI 's got more PR-men than agents , and they spend half their time building up the Mafia Menace in books and movies and TV shows , so they can soften up Congress to give them more money so the FBI honchos can ride around in Lincolns and fly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Norton protested , " are you saying there is n't a Mafia ? " " I 'm saying that the Mafia , as an institution , is about as big a menace to public safety as the Boy Scouts , and is one hell of a lot less of a menace than the people who make cigarettes or the people who make those big dangerous goddam Detroit automobiles or the American Medical Association . Hell , those damn doctors kill a hundred times as many people every year as the Mafia does , and they deal in two hundred times as much dope , and they charge more for it too . The lousy bastards . " Norton looked at Gabe with interest ; there was something more than the usual cynicism in his voice . " You do n't like doctors , Gabe ? " Gabe turned on Norton the coldest stare he had ever seen . " A doctor killed my mother and charged my old man thirty thousand bucks for it , " he said . " And then my old man killed himself trying to pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't like doctors . Among other pillars of our society . But that 's not your worry . " Gabe killed his drink and after a moment Norton did the same . " Okay , Gabe , " he said , " the Justice Department or the U.S. Attorney 's office or somebody is putting out this story about the Mafia killing Fields . So what does that prove ? " " For one thing , it proves once more the truth of Pincus 's Law . " " Which is ? " " Which is , and I quote , The more vigorously a politician denies a given assertion , the more likely that assertion is to be true . ' As for example , We seek no wider war ' or I shall never resign ' or I am not a crook ' and et cetera . In the case at hand , if you go poking around the White House , the line they 're putting out is that Whitmore never heard of Jeff Fields , or maybe , just maybe , he might have shook his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's a dirty and demonstrable lie , they got the U.S. Attorney 's office to trot out the Mafia story , in hopes that a crime-crazed media will swallow  | it , which most of the idiots will . But the bottom line , my friend , is that they 're scared shitless of somebody making the linkup between Fields and Whitmore and Donna . " " But who is they ' ? " Norton asked , with something close to agony in his voice . " Is it Whitmore ? Murphy ? Kifner ? Riddle ? Who the hell is running this damn show ? " Gabe shrugged and spit a sliver of hangnail onto the floor . " That , in case you had n't noticed yet , is what we 're trying to find out . We do n't know yet . But , like I said , it 's best to assume the worst . I would n't want you being disillusioned later on . " Norton slumped forward and stared at his shoes for a while . They needed shining . Then he remembered something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something I forgot to tell you about . That last afternoon , when he wanted to talk to me but was afraid to , he kept saying something about a tape . " " He said what ? " " What he said was something like This is n't my problem . . . If it just was n't for that damn tape . ' He would n't explain , but he was worried as hell . " " Holy shit , " Gabe cried . " Then it 's true . " " What 's true ? " " One of my sources had heard about the tape , but he did n't know what to make of it . " " What to make of what ? " " See , when the cops searched the house on Volta Place , they found this fancy voice-activated taping system . Anything you said in that house was taped . Or could be . " " What for ? " " Who knows ? Maybe Fields liked to pick up dialogue for his movies that way . Maybe he was just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed . Maybe he planned to set up politicians with girls there and play some blackmail games . Maybe all of the above . I do n't know . The point is that the cops found the taping system but no tapes . Fields claimed he 'd never used the system  --  never put any tape in it  --  but he
