In a popular TV show of the ' 50s , The Millionaire , a vigilant philanthropist would single out deserving citizens and then stun them with a big check . Philanthropist Thomas Cannon , 53 , is no multimillionaire , however . He is a black postal worker in Richmond earning $16,000 a year , who in the past five years has somehow managed to give away more than $33,000 of his own money . Most of it has gone , in $1,000 checks , to strangers whose misfortunes or good deeds he has read about . Some of his beneficiaries : a Colombian orphan who needed heart surgery ; a couple who have been foster parents to 40 children ; a civic-minded , wealthy businessman who quickly returned the gift . Why does he do it ? Cannon believes that " the quest for money and acquisitions can be very self-destructive . " So he and his wife Princetta give away as much as they can , while living in a house with a leaky roof and driving a battered 1963 Chevy.      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
