" All English sopranos are virgins , " a noted Broadway composer once moaned after an afternoon spent listening to British recordings . Chastity aside , there is a definite odor of sanctity in the tones of most English sopranos . At their best in church music by Bach , Handel and Mozart , they tend to frost the edges of more hot-blooded music . An exception who can deal both with purity and passion is British Mezzo-Soprano Janet Baker . Recently at Aldeburgh , England , she proved it with the English Opera Group by singing the tricky title role in Benjamin Britten 's The Rape of Lucretia . <P> When he composed the opera in 1946 , Britten must have had in mind a voice like Janet Baker 's . He gave an unusual twist to the tale of **37;2047;TOOLONG . After the rape that precipitates the Roman Revolution of 510 B.C. , Lucretia 's husband consoles her by saying , " If spirit 's not given , there is no need of shame . " Alas , Lucretia , who found herself secretly and pleasurably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> Few singers have managed to suggest a Lucretia whose internal temperature is drastically higher than her cool exterior . Though she came on looking as wholesome as an English garden , Baker did just that . She seemed aquiver with passion , then overwhelmed with shame at her own suddenly revealed sexuality . Her voice , which can sound as pure as any singer 's , took on a smoldering quality that reinforced Librettist Ronald Duncan 's words : <P> How cruel men are . . . They wake us from The sleep of youth Into the dream of passion Then ride away While we still yearn . <P> For Janet Baker , Britten 's Lucretia is one more success in a recent series of remarkable operatic portraits : the giggling , compliant Dorabella in Mozart 's Cosi fan tutte , and twin Didos ( Purcell 's Dido and Aeneas and Berlioz 's Les Troy ens ) . Still , she is a relative newcomer to opera . Her main work so far has been done in oratorios and lieder . <P> Janet Baker was born 37 years ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hearing a local Gilbert and Sullivan production , she was asked if she had liked it . " No , " said the youngster . " It is n't good music and it was n't well done . " <P> In her teens she worked as a bank clerk to pay for voice lessons . When she was 20 , she finally found a suitable teacher . " Her theory , " explains Baker , " was that if it is n't easy , it 's wrong . Singing is a natural function . You clear away the debris to let what 's there come through . " The Baker career began seriously in 1965 , when Conductor Anthony Lewis asked her to sing Dido for a new recording of the Purcell opera . Soon she was singing for Giulini , Barbirolli , Szell and Klemperer . " If you ca n't develop with help from gigantic personalities like those , " she says , " you should pack up and go home .
