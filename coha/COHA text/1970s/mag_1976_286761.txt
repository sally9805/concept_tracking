Viking . $8.95 . <P> <P> In the pantheon of Hindu gods , Saraswati is the goddess of pen , ink and books . She must have given the young Godden sisters a double blessing . Half a century later , the ex-colonials are still writing with fecundity and style-often about their childhood in India . Jon , 70 , has just produced her tenth novel ; Rumer , 69 , her 15th . Rumer has also written poetry , stories and children 's books . In addition , the Goddens have collaborated on two volumes : Shiva 's Pigeons ( 1972 ) and the highly acclaimed Two Under the Indian Sun ( 1966 ) , a memoir of the years spent among the textures and atmospheres of India past .

As the headstrong woman explores higher and higher-above the last town , above the encampments of the nomadic Gujar tribe , above the tree line - the air becomes cleaner and thinner and her life more elemental . The solitude and longed-for " power of seeing , really seeing " pull her onward . Leah 's servant , Ahmed , shares her drive , but he is eager only to leave behind a life of error . Despite their backgrounds the un likely pair draw closer until the purity of the landscape erodes their differences . <P> In The Peacock Spring , Rumer again evidences the profound understanding of children that she showed in The River and An Episode of Sparrows . Two adolescent English girls , Una and Halcy on , are called out to Delhi by their envoy father - only to discover that they are chaperones to his Eurasian fiancee .

Then Una and Ravi , a young Indian poet , fall in love - and the India of poverty , distances , dust , stenches , desperate class divisions , overcrowding , sacred rivers , rises from the mist . <P> Rumer and Jon were wrenched away from India and sent to school in England before they were ready to part from the reality and the symbols of a happy childhood . Probably this separation affected Rumer more seriously ; it is she who seems obsessed with the torments of young people hovering on the steps of maturity . It is she who ar rests the mind with a metaphor for the land of contrasts , the country whose preening beauty can not mask the terror that persists in life as in fictive reconstructions : " Do you know why the peacock gives those terrible screams ?
