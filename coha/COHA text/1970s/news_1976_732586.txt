txt A major congressional reform , designed by Congress itself to banish the old pork-barrel spending era and save billions of tax dollars , faces a fresh challenge from inside Congress . At issue is whether or not powerful committee chairmen ? in this case Sen. Russell Long ( D ) of Louisiana and his Senate Finance Committee ? must bow to the new budgetmaking process adopted by Congress in 1974 . Sen. Edmund S. Muskie ( D ) of Maine , chairman of the Senate Budget Committee , raises a red warning flag against encroachments on the new budgetary process , still relatively untried and vulnerable to political pressures . The key point , congressional sources agree , is not the current clash between Senators Long and.Muskie , but whether the basic system itself ? " designed to put the fiscal house in order , " said a staffer ? can weather the storm . The specific issue : On May 13 , under its new budgetary rules , Congress agreed on fiscal 1977 spending outlays of $413.3 billion , revenues of $362.5 billion , and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goals require the tax-writing committees ? House Ways and Means and Senate Finance ? to come up with $2 billion of additional tax income through loophole closiqg . Senator Long 's committee says it can produce only $1 billion more // *Congress in feud over budget reform // In effect , the two budget committees ( Senator Muskie 's and its House counterpart , chaired by Rep. Brock Adams ( D ) of Washington ) are being told by the Senate Finance Committee to revise their targets ? either reduce spending by another $1 billion or accept a larger deficit . Messrs . Muskie and Adams , noting that the full Congress ? by its May 13 vote ? accepted the Budget Committees ' targets , see the Long challenge as a potential threat to the system . Senator Long , denying any intention to .. attack the system , says his committee , not the Budget Committee , has jurisdiction to decide how tax revenues should be raised . In fact , * says Senator Long , the Finance Committee will meet Budget Committee targets ? ' partly by increasing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person tax ? credit June 30 , 1977 . This combination , according to the Finance Committee chief , would meet Budget Committee goals . Senator Muskie disagrees , on the grounds that Congress will not accept taking that tax credit away from Americans next June . Enmeshed in this argument is the key word " jurisdiction . " Are the new budget committees to tell other committee chairmen what legislation they can pass ? Other committee chairmen , presumably , are ? watching the Long-Muskie tussle to see what limits Congress ultimately may put upon the new budgetary process . " It seems to me , " said a congressional staffer , " that anything so revolutionary as this new budget process is going to take its lumps from time to time . " He sees the system , which aims . eventually at balanced federal budgets , surviving intact . Another key staffer agrees : " Remember , " he said , " the budget targets ' voted in May are just that ? targets . In September Congresi must ? vote final totals and , between now and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bow to support the system . " " I 'm astonished at how well we 're doing " to implement the new budget process , said a congressional source .
