txt At 11:30 p.m . Donald Lynk , a farmer for 17 years , ends a long , long day cultivating and fertilizing acreage for corn planting . At 2:30 a.m . Walter Keathly also decides to get some sleep . As district superintendent for Gulf Central Pipeline Company , Mr. Keathly is overseeing round-the-clock pipeline distribution of fertilizer . At 4:30 a.m. , the sun not quite , risen , Ted Dowler hoists himself into the cab of his trailer truck to start another day . He figures he will put in 12 hours getting three 18-ton tankloads of fertilizer from a large storage tank and delivering them to farm distributors . In United States corn country it is peak planting time . And a new fertilizer pipeline ? in full operation for the first time this year ? is having an immense impact . Farmers need a lot of fertilizer in a brief period of time these days : They spread a year 's production of fertilizer in six weeks . That 's the nature ? and the challenge ? of the fertilizer industry : getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The pipeline helps , carrying anhydrous ammonia to the Midwest , where Iowa alone produces about 20 percent of the nation 's corn , most of it feed for cattle and hogs . Illinois produces another 20 percent . Farmers spread a year 's production of fertilizer in Six weeks in these hectic days . This year , early and dry spring weather and hopes of making up for some of last year 's severe corn-blight losses send farmer scurrying to plant more corn than usual . Nationwide , 6 percent more acreage than usual is being planted in corn , the most acreage since 1960. // Ily a staff photographer More than usual this year *Ammonia flowing in pipeline to corn belt // In Iowa , which generates fully one-tenth of the nation 's food supply , the increase in corn acreage is expected to be 12 percent . AnhydrouS ammonia , because of its high nitrogen content , is a major corn-belt fertilizer . Much of it , however , is manufactured near the Gulf of Mexico where its raw component , natural gas , is available . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pipeline is a real breakthrough in logistics , " says Edwin M. Wheeler , president of the Fertilizer Institute . C F Industries , a major producer and dis- tributor of the pungent-smelling anhydrous ammonia , agrees . Although the firm still ships its product also by refrigerated barges up the Mississippi and Illinois Rivers , it is the pipeline 's main customer . R. R. ( Barney ) Baxter , president of C F Industries , calls the pipeline a " significant advance in transporting fertilizer material to the farmer . " Gulf Central 's 1,800-mile pipeline stretches from the Gulf of Mexico through Louisiana and Arkansas into Missouri . From Missouri , a spur scoots east through southern Illinois and central Indiana while the trunk continues up to northern Iowa before circling southwest into Nebraska . Last year the pipeline , not yet complete , was partially used . But after negotiating easements with an average of four owners per mile , the buried line was finally completed . And this year it is getting heavy-duty action . In April alone , Mr. Baxter said , C F Industries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shipped by the company in any previous one-month period . Of that total , some 145,000 tons went through the pipeline . April is being characterized as the busiest month in the history of anhydrous-ammonia usage Fertilizer manufacturers hope this means the current planting season will bring them a profit for the first time in four fertilizer years . Corn-planting season , they say , is usually the key since corn is the biggest user of plant nourishment . And of the various types of fertilizers , Mr. Wheeler of the Ferlilizer Institute dubs anhydrous ammonia the " bellwether . " And the bellwether , he adds , is saying , " Up  --  strongly . " This is good news for the Gulf Central Pipeline Company , which appears to have anticipated an active market . Selling points stressed Pipeline promoters emphasize two selling points . more economical shipping rates than rail or trucks and flexible , available delivery . Since the pipeline is always full  --  holding 700,000 tons of anhydrous ammonia  --  a producer entering a ton in Louisiana enjoys immediate delivery hundreds of miles away at terminals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ key points on the pipeline  --  a major one being located here outside rural Marshalltown . The silver tank holds up to 30,000 tons of anhydrous ammonia . Although the fertilizer is regularly pumped into the tank , trucks now are emptying it at a faster rate . On one day at peak cultivating and planting time . 78 trucks drew 18-ton loads of the liquid . From a 30,000-ton storage tank , anhydrous ( lows into the truck-trailer tanks , and eventually into two-ton nurse tanks ? the size that farmers haul behind their tractors . Then , of course , into the ground where the liquid turns into gas and its nitrogen clings to the soil . Nitrogen feeds growing corn and , it is maintained , doubles production Farmer Donald Lynk is more than 900 miles from where his ammonia is produced . He is what Gulf Central 's new pipeline is all about . A ride over unmarked , gravel Iowa roads , through a fence gate , and onto a narrow . bumpy strip of unplowed farmland brings one to Mr. Lynk and his tractor Their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of dust and a thin trickle of engine smoke " I expect to plant GOO acres in corn altogether , " Mr. Lynk explains after bringing his rasping 6 m.p.h. tractor to a halt and climbing down from'his one-seat , enclosed perch . He applies about 150 pounds of anhydrous ammonia to an acre , amoutliting to a pound of it for slightly more than a bushel of corn Mr. Lynk can run off a nurse tank of the liquid in about 31/2 hours . So the pipeline keeps pumping
