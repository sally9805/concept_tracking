Being twenty-five seconds behind veteran driver Jimmy Clark in an automobile race was almost the same as being out of the race . However , the spectators at Silverstone knew that the cool Englishman so far behind just might do something unbelievable . He was Graham Hill , who had turned the odds around a few times before . Besides eating the leader 's dust , he was now calmly battling two other drivers for second position . Suddenly one of them went off the road and Hill darted in front of the other . He was gaining fractional seconds with each lap and , approaching the last corner just before the finish , he made his move to pass Clark on the inside . Clark saw him in his mirror and " shut the gate " by hugging the curb . Hill 's only chance was to go around outside Clark where the track was still wet from a rain squall minutes before . He did not hesitate ; he whipped out into the wet and stood on the throttle . His car stewed , spraying water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finish line  --  sideways ! The grandstand stood stunned , then exploded . It was one of international racing 's most determined finishes . At the prize-giving ceremony , reporters asked about the sideways driving . Hill replied without cracking a smile , " It was the only way to keep my eyes on Jimmy and my ears out for the fellows . " This was in 1962 , the year Graham Hill won his first world championship as a Grand Prix driver , the top title in motor racing . Today , at forty-six , he is agelessly handsome , scrupulously sportsmanlike under fantastic pressures , unfailingly courteous when strangers shove batteries of cameras twelve inches from his face ( " D' ya think you 'll make it another year ? " " You gon na retire this year ? " " How 's the broken legs holding up ? " ) , he is living proof of the power of hanging in there . Prime ministers in fourteen languages call him " Mr. Hill " ; mechanics and waiters around the world call him " Graham " with equal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Prix races , he is considered by fellow drivers to be dean of the toughest races in sports . He is the only man in racing history to have made the grand slam of winning the three ranking titles  --  Grand Prix world championship driver , the Indianapolis 500 , and the classic endurance race , the twenty-four hours of Le Mans . It is a record many professionals doubt will be equaled in this century . At age twenty-four , Graham Hill was an engineering apprentice with an instrument company in London , with a straig t shot at an ultimate top business career . He had never owned or driven a car or seen a motor race . However , he had an opportunity to buy a used car from a friend , Two weeks later he passed his driver license test and a joking colleague tossed a magazine ad onto his desk . " Now you should try this . " Hill had no compulsion about cars or driving . What he did have was a very low threshold of boredom and an insouciant love of adventure . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four laps . The little racing car vibrated and roared and gave him a scare . But when he stepped out of it he was hooked . He wanted to drive in a real race . In those days racing was for well-to-do men who could afford to buy and maintain racing cars . Hill had no such money . In the hope of driving , he quit his job to work as a racing school mechanic . " I did n't really know anything about racing cars , " he admits , " But I 'd strip cars down and try to remember how they came apart . " His only pay was to drive in a race , and he got his chance on April 27 , 1954 . The only real information he had was that the maximum revs limit for the car was 6,000 rpm . " So , " he says , " I just wound it up to 6,000 and sat waiting for the start flag . Then I took my foot off the clutch and shot off up the track like a rocket . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much less driven in one  --  he finished second . He was given a lift home by Colin Chapman of Lotus Works . then a small auto shop in a stable . Chapman , later to become one of the great car builders , mentioned he happened to have a problem getting his smashed Mark 6 repaired for an upcoming race . Hill said , " By coincidence , I happen to have a bit of time available . " Graham began working at Lotus for one pound a day . He accumulated some driving experience , supplemented his education by going to the Steering Wheel Club in London to listen to racing talk . He heard some points on the fine arts of passing on the corners , driving on a wet track , slipstreaming ( the technique of tailgating so close that the leader 's vacuum pulls the follower along ) . And he heard about the ultimate in racing  --  the Grand Prix . The Grand Prix is just what it says  --  the grand prize . At once the world 's most historic and most advanced motor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ races staged in some fifteen countries each year over the most famous and challenging courses , each with a special treachery . About thirty individuals manage to qualify for Grand Prix races . Within these thirty , a half dozen will earn World Championship points for placing in the first six at the finish . Within this half dozen each year will be one winner . The Grand Prix is a quite personal thing : it is man against the overwhelming and life here is lived at the very limit . The Grand Prix type car 's stupefying roar pounds through the chest bones and surrounds the heart . The Formula One engine wo n't idle ; it must be kept alive by short bursts of throttle which beat the eardrums like the hammers of hell . The shovel-nosed , high-tailed machine is an $80,000 torture chamber that puts the driver nearly on his back in an aluminum teardrop just inches above ground that races under him at up to 200 mph . Surrounding him are fifty gallons of low-flash fuel , rolling on wheels of light magnesium which burn with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 450-odd horses want to shove the aerodynamic shell straight into the sky . The Grand Prix 's message to millions who catch it is the high degree of human effort , courage , endurance and skill that is possible in pursuit of any grand prize . Catastrophe is not the appeal , but victory over it . The message is not that you can fail but that you can win . In May 1958 , Graham found himself attempting qualifying heats for his first Grand Prix  --  the Monte Carlo  --  one hundred laps around the 1.9-mile circuit . Possibly the most elegant circuit , it is also one of the trickiest . There is nowhere to spin off the track safely . " You bounce off hotels , nightclubs , brick walls , street lamps , " Hill explains . " You come to a stop rather smartly . " Only the fastest sixteen drivers would qualify and , to the amazement of his colleagues and himself , Graham drove fast enough to earn sixteenth starting position . Even more amazing , by the seventy-fifth lap , Graham was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  twelve of the sixteen cars had dropped out . Suddenly the car spun , the engine whined . Thinking it had jumped out of gear , he fought clutch and gearshift . Then something off to the side caught his eye . It was one of his rear wheels rolling along beside him . He braked to a stop , climbed out andcollapsed of heat exhaustion . Hill underwent a stern initiation in his first Grand Prix circuit . As a dark horse newcomer , he was excluded from the fraternity of drivers he so much admired . Under a hard core , veterans always want to know how a new man performs under all Grand Prix conditions . If a sudden weather change wets the road , puddles become blinding mirrors , the car aquaplanes and loses steering . If cars ahead drop oil , the pursuer is on a skating rink . If one-hundred-degree sun melts the tar out of the macadam , wheels fire back released gravel bullets to shotblast pursuers . The cloud of smoke and dust from an accident ahead gives the next man milliseconds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prove his capability . Until he does , he eats alone . Graham almost quit after his first encounter with the Spa-Francorchamps track in Belgium . Roaring down the terribly fast straightaway in pre-race practice , his car kept going faster and faster . Never had he driven a track which allowed the car to reach its maximum . The track seemed to grow narrower and narrower , and his speed continued increasing . At 30 mph faster than he had ever driven in his life , Hill knuckled under . " I backed off the throttle in a blue funk . I went back to the pits to think . I decided right there I was n't cut out to be a Grand Prix driver . " Hill walked around the car , glaring at the beast . But then he remembered his early struggle to get a drive , his months as a mechanic without pay . Very gingerly , he climbed backinto the car and wound up the engine . Slowly he eased out onto the track . He remembers it well : " In a few laps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then I pushed it beyond . The car quit accelerating before I did . I felt a little better . " At Rheims , France , another lesson . His car was a new model with a gearbox by his hip . This gearbox heated , melting the solder so the oil filter cap fell off , splashing boiling oil on his legs . The crowd was startled to see Hill take a 160-mph corner half-standing in the cockpit to avoid the hot oil . He was learning that , despite handcrafted perfection , a car can take only so much . Under Grand Prix punishment , wheels regularly fly off , bearings seize , rubber melts , shocks break , shafts snap , brakes wipe out , connecting rods emerge through the sides of the engine . At the German Grand Prix , high in the Eifel Mountains , Hill raced into low clouds as the fourteen-mile circuit climbed 1,000 feet and twisted through 187 curves with different degrees of banking . Theoretically , the chassis of a race car ca n't touch ground , but after the German @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ metal . In this race his friend Peter Collins was killed . Being the " new boy " in Grand Prix , Graham had few to commiserate with . But by this time he was determined . In the Italian race , at Monza , his radiator split . He had to stop three times for water , losing time . Then his pit signaled him to come in because they spotted flames . He beat out the fire with a glove . Then his brake pedal went to the floor , soft . His pit crew could see he was out of brakes , but to their amazement he blasted past the pits full bore . Just short of the finish line , the engine sputtered out . He coasted across the line out of water , out of gas and out of brakes  --  in fifth place . That brought him his first two world championship points , and the lesson : hang in there . The 1959 season was discouraging . He did not finish one race and earned no world championship points . But his coolness and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he received an offer to drive for the British Racing Motors Team . By mid-season 1960 he had no very satisfying record , but in the Dutch Grand Prix he discovered that magic difference that made the winners  --  time to think . In a two-and-ahalf-hour drive , in which only twenty-five seconds may span the winner and loser , cockpit pressure squeezes out strategy thinking . A driver is busy watching his eight gauges  --  oil , fuel , water , rev counter  --  watching the road change like a movie from straight to hairpin to double-ess turn . His mental computer races to absorb signals from the pit , officials , other cars , and his landmarks while he 's clutching and braking , leaving no time for strategy thinking . However , in the Dutch race , Graham felt that he was really planning realistically for the first time . He was near the front of the pack , but one of the sport 's coolest drivers , Stirling Moss , was gaining on him rapidly . If Hill forced more speed from his own car , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He found himself sudden . ly thinking very deliberately : exactly how fast is Moss gaining ? As carefully as he could , he arrived at two seconds per lap . He had a twenty-six-second lead over Moss , as close as he could estimate , and twelve laps to go . That meant that he would come in two seconds ahead of Moss if he could maintain his pace without mistakes . At the finish , Hill came in a second and a half ahead of Moss . It was a confidence maker and from that race forward he became a formidable contender . All around the Grand Prix circuit the crowds in all languages began looking for the Englishman with the white vertical stripes on his dark blue helmet , knowing he was always certain to make the race exciting . In 1962 , he won his first Grand Prix , the Dutch . From then on it became a two-man battle between Jimmy Clark and Hill for the world championship . It was one of the most closely fought duels in racing history . Hill drove his hardest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the very last race at East London , South Continued on page 98 // continued from page 92 Africa , he emerged as champion of the world . On the winner 's rostrum they put around his neck a laurel wreath so long it reached his feet and so thick it obscured his prominent chin and nose  --  but not his tongue . Reaching out through his draped shrubbery for the prime minister 's hand , he thanked him for his compliments and his hospitality . " And especially , " he added , " for this privet hedge , which I intend no one shall clip . " Hill was a new kind of champion . The eight-month Grand Prix schedule is so demanding that drivers are always in a hurry to be off to the next race . Hill , on the contrary , savors the Grand Prix cities , their ceremonies , their people . He walks their streets before and after races , buys and reads their native books , talks to the people . His international Christmas card list rivals a village phone book . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bette to meet the people he has met abroad . He particularly loves to kid with the drivers in the paddock , and he enjoys a good counterpuncher . One such is Rob Walker , a veteran race team owner . Hill owns his own plane and Walker usually flies with him to the Niirburgring race . Once , flying in foggy weather , Graham said , " Rob . just peek out the window and see if you can find where we are . " Walker looked down , " Well , the cars are not driving on the left , so it ca n't be England . There are no fjords , so it ca n't be Scandinavia . I 'd pinpoint us as somewhere over Europe . " " Excellent , " Hill replied . " Then we 're right on course . " There is an argument among drivers and auto racing fans as to which is the most challenging racing : Grand Prix , the Le Mans twenty-four-hour endurance race , or the Indianapolis 500 . In 1966 Hill decided to find out for himself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ qualified for the race . When the starting flag lowered , the thirty-three roaring monsters accelerated toward the first corner . Within seconds , the two cars touched and set off a massive holocaust in which eleven cars were totally demolished . The race was stopped . On the second start , Hill was in thirteenth place . Because of accidents the track was slick with oil , causing several cars to spin out . Graham fought his way up to second place behind Lloyd Ruby . He kept pouring it on . He passed Ruby . With the 500-mile finish line in sight , Hill was ahead and he knew no one could catch him . It was the first time since 1926 that a first-timer on the Indy won it . " Mark you , it 's only fair to say , " Hill characteristically explains , " that there were extenuating circumstances  --  like a third of the field being knocked out on the first lap ! " In 1968 Queen Elizabeth conferred upon him the Order of the British Empire . With two out of three championships @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ champion in 1968 ? ail was right with Hill 's world . Then came the United States Grand Prix in October 1969 at Watkins Glen . He had earned fourth place on the starting grid behind Denny Hulme and Jackie Stewart . But soon after the start his car began handling poorly . He dropped back to fifth place . A lead car dropped some oil on the track and he spun on it , stalling the engine . He quickly unbuckled his seat belt and jumped out to push his car back on the track . He noted his rear tires were bald and chunking , which explained the spinout . The handling problem worsened . As he flashed by the pit , he pointed to the rear tires so the crew would be ready for a fast tire change next lap . The next lap never came . His right rear tire collapsed throwing him out of control . The car hit a bank , cart-wheeled end over end , spraying smoking parts in a fantastic disintegration . Horrified spectators saw the cockpit fly upside down through the air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night the news that Jochen Rindt had won the greatest purse in Grand Prix history was lost under the announcement that Graham Hill was through . He lay mangled in shock in nearby Arnot Ogden Memorial Hospital , Elmira , New York , with both knees broken , ligaments torn , and nerves damaged . Rindt , Denny Hulme and Jackie Stewart went to the hospital and returned with a grim report : " Very disastrous . " Around the world the Grand Prix public and other race drivers were stunned . The switch-board at the hospital had never had to contend with such traffic . Everyone wanted to know : " Is it true ? " He was flown to England 's University College Hospital where the best team of race crash surgeons performed four and a half hours of surgery . Afterward , newspapers were told that Hill would never race again , possibly never walk . Days later he was fretting that he was missing the Mexican Grand Prix . Physicians ceased trying to explain his condition to him . They explained things instead to his wife , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know this race driver very well . After some weeks , Hill was wheeled to the hospital stationary bicycle for exercise therapy . He did the prescribed fifteen-minute workout and allowed himself to be wheeled back to his bed . When the nurse went away , he affixed his medical chart to a hook on the wheelchair like a racing number and wheeled himself back to the exercise room for more laps on the cycle . After days of this , he discovered the weights , and began a conditioning program . Five hours , then six . One day a hospital employee discovered an empty wheelchair at the foot of the back service stairway . Down the air shaft came sounds of exertion . On the stairs he encountered Graham Hill gripping the handrail with both hands and pulling himself up one laborious step at a time . When he was allowed to leave the hospital for short periods , Ford Motor Company supplied a car with a chauffeur to drive him . On country roads Hill began changing places with the driver . After he had had some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the hospital after he 'd been put to bed , went down the back stairs to his Ford and practiced driving around at night . Meanwhile , Chapman had hired another driver . Graham heard about it . One day in February , while Rob Walker was visiting him , he said very quietly , " Rob , I 'm going to the March Grand Prix in South Africa . Can I drive for you ? " Walker studied him , then nodded . " We had to lift him into the car , " Walker says , " but , blimey , he went down that track just flat as a cake , doing 170 . " When they lifted him out of the car , Hill said , " The brakes are a little bit hard for me . Ca n't push them . " The team mechanics installed a double master brake cylinder . After more practice , the news flashed abroad that Hill had qualified for a starting place . Papers which usually send one man sent two  --  one to cover the race , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worldwide racing community set clocks for the middle of the night and phoned ham radio operators for the results . In England , the BBC interrupted the regular newscast . " But here 's what you are waiting for . In the Grand Prix , Graham Hill has just come in sixth , earning one World Championship point . " The compelling magnetism of the man is partly explained by the fact that he enjoys . He enjoys the crowd , enjoys his competitors , enjoys the prize giving , thoroughly enjoys being kissed by the race queen . He especially enjoys it when a hard-driving competitor marked by years of hard trying bulls through with a justified victory . He has always wanted to win the British Grand Prix , the only one which constantly eludes him . Even the non-Grand Prix Easter Sunday race at Silverstone would have compensated him some . Once , after losing a hairsplitter there to Jochen Rindt , he commented , " It was a fabulous race . We both had a lovely time ! And so did the crowd ! " There remained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours of he Mans . This is a grueling ' round-the-clock test of man and car in which two drivers alternating the drive run flat out in a huge field of entrants on the eight-and-a-half-mile course at he Mans , France . It begins at 4:00 p.m. on Saturday and finishes at 4:00 p.m. on Sunday . By dawn , the field has diminished drastically . Dawn at the 1972 he Mans found Hill 's car still blasting around the circuit with the survivors . Then came the rains . Cars aquaplaned all over the track , some spinning out into the scenery . But at four o'clock in the afternoon the crowd saw the Englishman 's car streak across the finish a breath ahead of the remaining pack . Unassisted , Graham Hill limped up to the winner 's stand . While the triple crown makes Hill a man apart , he is also the man most in the middle of it all . In their never-ending quest for technical improvement , car builders continue to draw on his experience and knowledge of things mechanical . " Engineering plays a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The excruciating conditions of competitive driving ca n't be duplicated on a factory proving ground . It 's a question of motivation . Therefore motor racing becomes engineering 's real testing laboratory . Competition natback to the windshield . Drivers who pulled him out were concerned about his vulnerable legs . " I did myself no damage , " he said . Looking ruefully at his car , he added , " But I 've shortened the car a bit . " His myriad friends are constantly urging him to quit Grand Prix driving while he 's ahead . " Oh , I ca n't do that , " he says . " What is there left to win ? " they ask . His eyes twinkle . " Well , I 've never won the British , you know . " Then he turns serious for a brief moment . " I love racing , " he says , " and as long as I enjoy it I shall continue to do it . But it occurs to me more that I might never stop enjoying it , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rs urally forces technical advances  --  which years later show up in your ordinary road car . " Laymen constantly ask him how to improve their day-to-day driving performance . The summary of his advice is characteristic : " anticipation , concentration  --  and toleration . " To help get the message abroad he has launched a British television series on driving safety called " Advanced Driving With Graham Hill . " Because family life is necessarily limited by Hill 's racing schedule , it is the more cherished . He and Bette , who attends as many races as she can ( and is frequently mistaken for Elizabeth Taylor ) , work at furnish ing as normal as possible a childhood for their three youngsters  --  she gets to fewer and fewer races and Graham 's big extravagance is coming home between close-scheduled events , even if it means a 9,000-mile round trip . He will fly thousands of miles to an injured driver 's bedside or drop out of a race if he can be of some crucial service to a colleague in trouble . He is a stickler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , again , it comes around to his enjoyment of people .

He only comes in here once or twice a year , but he calls you by name , just casually , like you were part of his life . There 'll never be another like him . " Today auto racing is second only to horse racing as the United States ' most popular spectator sport and , as president of the Grand Prix Drivers ' Association , Hill conducts a driver meeting before every race , going over rules , ethics , safety regulations and negotiations with the local race organizers . He now owns his own racing team and drives for it . In a recent accident , he stuffed his car straight into a sand bank , corrugating the snout way             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
