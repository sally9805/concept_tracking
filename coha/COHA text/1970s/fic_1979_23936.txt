RACE RELATIONS A short story by Joseph Epstein c ' MON , FLOWERS , YOU RED-NECK , you cracker bastard , throw , let ' er fly , baby , if you got the balls . " I do n't exactly know what had happened : whether in the boredom of a Saturday afternoon at the end of our fourth of eight weeks of basic training Bobby Flowers , late of Jonesboro , Arkansas , had called Jackson Gates , late of Detroit , Michigan , a nigger , or Gates had applied some similar magic word to Flowers . But someone had said something to someone , and it appeared as if we might have a small race war on our hands in Charley Company , Second Battalion , Third Training Regiment , Fort Leonard Wood , Missouri . Gates , along with five of his Negro pals , was on the porch of their barracks , while Flowers , with nine or ten of his good 01 ' boys , rocks in their fists , was about to charge up after them . The scene reminded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chicago , at Riverview , the great amusement park at Western Avenue and Belmont , for a quarter you could get three lumpy baseballs with which to try to knock a Negro in the water . The Negroes , four of them , sat in separate cages , each upon a swinglike platform three or so feet above a shallow pool of water . A bar extended out from the left of each of these cages , at the end of which was a disc of steel perhaps a foot in diameter . Hit the disc with a baIl and the bar triggered the platform , which fell away , dropping the Negro in the pool of water . In accomplishing this feat the lumpiness of the baseballs and the throwing distance of some ninety or a hundred feet were really minor obstacles . The major obstacle was that the Negroes within the cages taunted the customers , picking out some trait in them and playing it for a public laugh at their expense . " C'm on ya squinty little mothah , " a Negro in one of the cages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ luck , " les ' see what you got . " And then , when the man missed all three throws , the Negro would return with , " Sorry , squints  --  no bowl of rice ! " Men with girlfriends or wivesin tow were especially vulnerable . " That the best you can do , Peewee ? " ? or , as the trait might have been , " Fatso , " or " Four-eyes , " or " Baldy . " Sometimes they would turn their buttocks toward the customer , bend over , and call out from between their legs , " Pit-i-ful . " I have seen men grow so enraged that they forgot the disc that triggered the platform and threw directly at the cage , hoping the ball would go through the wire and crash against the Negro 's skull . Often a man would spend five or six dollars and damn near throw his arm out before he had the satisfaction of knocking one of those jeering Negroes in the water . " All right , " Sergeant Alerton boomed , striding across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me the chance to kick some ass before I knock off for the weekend . " A tall man , ebony and elegant in fatigues , boots , and helmet liner , Sergeant Alerton adopted the style with trainees of a menacing Kingfish : he could make jokes  --  fine Kingfishian ones  --  but he was not a man you fooled with . His first announcement to us recruits after we had arrived at Charley Company , our heads freshly shaved , writhing in the itchiness of our new uniforms and nearly lame from the stiffness of our boots , was about religious services . " On Sunday mornings , " he yelled , en basso , " every swinging dick among you will get your can out of the sack to attend church in the denomination of your choice . As for those of you of the Hebrew extraction , you will haul your cans off to Friday evening services , making arrangements to help GI the barracks for Saturday inspection later in the evening . " While helping out for two days in the orderly room when the company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been awarded a Bronze Star and a Purple Heart in Korea . Eleven years ago , before joining the regular army in 1948 , he had worked as a soda jerk in St. Louis . Alerton 's intervention was enough to calm things down . Gates and his gang disappeared into their barracks , Flowers and his walked off . Some of the troops went back to their touch football game in the Fort Leonard Wood dust ; others returned to writing letters or to poker games or to listening to radios in the barracks . I went off to the PX with two guys from my platoon for a beer and to pick up a can of shaving cream . The Gates-Flowers wrangle could have turned into something very ugly . Before I had thought Jackson Gates a somewhat comic figure ; I now began to think him perhaps also slightly dangerous . W HATEVER ELSE I might have thought about Negroes , I was not accustomed to thinking of them as dangerous . Most of what feelings I did have , I suspect I must have taken over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  years later 1 was surprised to learn that he had twice voted for Eisenhower over Adlai Stevenson  --  my father had rather special feelings about Negroes . Ernesta Robinson , a most upright middle-class Negro woman , was the secretary and bookkeeper for his small but successful business at a time when Negroes , men or women , were not generally allowed in office jobs . Once , when I was four or perhaps five years old , my father heard inc recite the street rhyme " Fenie meenie minie mo , catch a nigger by the toe , if he hollers let him go , " and upbraided me for it so severely that , not knowing why he was angry or where his anger was coming from , I collapsed into tears . " Of all people , " my father said , " we as Jews must never use such words . " Then at home , not living with us but coming in two days a week to clean and iron , was Dell , a short and very dark woman who was " with us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for as long as I could remember , but whose last name I never knew . Dell did not say much , but I remember her being especially kind to me , the oldest child , perhaps because she knew me longer than she knew my sister . " How Dell 's baby ? " she used to say to me when she had changed into her work clothes . When I was seven or eight , she would occasionally slip me a nickel . My mother told me I must find a polite way not to take these nickels ; Dell worked hard for her money and had better things to do with it than give it to me to spend on candy or gum . My mother used to give Dell those of her dresses she was no longer interested in , or make up for her a bag of fruit  --  some of it bruised , which neither my sister nor I , being finicky about such things , would eat  --  to take home for her family . One day in my eleventhyear I came home from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while washing our dining-room windows and , before an ambulance arrived , had died on our living-room couch . She was forty-seven years old . Could she have borne a son like Jackson Gates ? Although Gates was in the third platoon and I was in the second . I recalled noticing him on our first full day in Charley Company . Sergeant Roscoe Mullins , our field sergeant , a white man with a devoted beer-drinker 's stomach ? " Ah , " he used to exclaim , as we headed back to the company after one of our long marches , " I can taste that Falstaff now " ? asked if anyone among the trainees had any ROTC experience . Gates sprang forward to announce that lie had had three-and-a-half years of ROTC at Morgan State College . That three-and-a-half years sounded fishy to me  --  with four years , after all , he would have qualified as an officer ? but apparently it did not sound so to Sergeant Mullins , who appointed Gates trainee sergeant of the third platoon . With exaggerated posture , Gates saluted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Goddamn it , " Mullins returned , " what the hell they teach you in ROTC , Gates ? You do n't , damn you , salute and you do n't say sir ' to a noncommissioned officer ! " My father used to write an annual check of $100 for the NAACP , hit as he wrote out those checks I doubt that he had in mind someone who looked like Jackson Gates . In appearance , Gates was a liberal 's nightmare of a Negro , a middle-class Negro 's nightmare of a Negro , but a Ku Klux Klan cartoonist 's delight . He was not merely very dark but about four or five different colors ; his skin rather resembled the leather of an old hoot that had been shined first with black polish , then with cordovan-colored polish , then with oxblood , then brown , then black again . His large lips protruded , the bottom one pendulously ; two of his bottom teeth in the front were capped in gold . His nose was flat , the nostril holes the size of quarters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if it had once been bashed in on one side . His hair was shaved , as was everyone else 's in basic training , but in civilian life I imagine it must have been straightened and heavily pomaded in the style known as processed . He wore glasses with thick lenses and wide black frames , which , when he took them off , left him squinting with the look of someone who had just come up from a lengthy underwater swim . He was about five-foot-nine and muscular , but his muscularity had no athletic gracefulness about it  --  a point worth mentioning if only because , at a later time , he told me that in college he played second-string behind the Chicago Bears ' great running back Willie Gallimore . Certainty it seemed unlikely that Gates played behind Gallimore , yet who knew for sure in those days how deep in talent Negro colleges like Morgan State were ? He probably did n't , but then again he just may have . The same went for those three-and-a-half years of ROTC . Why three-and-a-half years ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hinted at his having gone to college at all . None of these need have been pressing questions but for the fact that , when basic training was completed , I was sent to clerk-typist school at Fort Chaffee , in Arkansas , and so , too , was Jackson Gates . I was sitting on my bunk , unpacking and laying out my gear the morning we arrived , when Gates threw his duffel bag atop the bunk next to mine . " What 's happenin ' , baby ? " " Not a hell of a lot , " I said . " Arkansas ! Daddy , this ai n't exactly my idea of a sweet place for a roan with my suntan . Dig ? " I replied that , since we apparently were not to be allowed to leave the base anyhow , it did n't matter too much where we were . My own situation , I said , was really not so different from his . " Let 's face it , Gates , the army shows no favoritism . It treats everyone as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said , " you ai n't too bad , you know that ? " A S IT TURNED OUT , Chaffee was a great improvement over Fort Leonard Wood . It was n't so cold ; one was n't always biting down on coal dust . Clerk-typist school entailed less spit and polish , less overall harassment , than basic training . After morning chow we would line up in fatigues , boots , helmet liners , and field jackets , but instead of rifles on our shoulders we would tote typing manuals under our arms . ( " Titless WACs " was the old army joke . ) We would be marched off to spend the morning learning to type to music , usually to very upbeat stuff such as the theme from Bridge over the River Kwai or John Philip Sousa marches ; return for lunch ; then march back to afternoon sessions about how to fill out morning reports . Although we could not go into the nearby town of Fort Smith ( not yet , at any rate ) , or even keep civilian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Our regular army platoon sergeants not only did n't mind poker games in the barracks but generally took a hand . Lights went out at nine , yet no one minded if you sat in the latrine and read . After not being allowed any books or magazines through all of basic training , I now went on a reading binge , gorging myself after lights-out on nineteenth-century Russian and English novels . One night around eleven o'clock I was sitting propped against the wall in the latrine , using my folded-up field jacket as a pillow , reading a Chekhov story entitled " An Anna Round His Neck , " when Jackson Gates walked in . " Hey , man , " he said from one of the urinals , his back to me , " you got it made , you know that ? " 1 did n't respond because I was n't quite sure exactly what he meant . Was he commenting on what must have been my evident pleasure in my hook ? Or was he , more significantly , talking about the fact that this was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 1 was white and he black , and that made all the difference in the world ? Whichever it might have been , Gates was evidently not going to elaborate upon the point . " Sacktime , " he announced , zipping himself up as he walked out of the latrine . Odd : it was a Wednesday night and Gates was wearing not his fatigues but his dress green uniform . He appeared , moreover , to be coming in from off the post , something strictly forbidden . But if he had n't gone of the post , then why was he wearing his dress greens ? It occurred to me that the last man who told me that I had it made was also a Negro , LeRoy Fortess , who worked for something like eleven years for my father as his shipping clerk , porter , mail clerk , and odd-jobs man . LeRoy was in his early forties , natty even in work clothes , and never without his hat , usually a fairly expensive gray fedora . LeRoy had an eye for the ladies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Saturdays for my father , LeRoy asked me to fetch him some cigarettes out of the drawer of his workbench . The cigarettes were there , all right , but so were two decks of playing cards with porno pictures on them and a half-dozen or so of an item that used to be known as a French tickler . Because of this discovery of LeRoy 's penchant for the illicit , I one day asked him if he could arrange to get false identification for a friend and me , so that , though under age , we could be served in bars . Not a problem , said LeRoy , and one Sunday my friend and I traveled out to the West Side to pick up LeRoy . LeRoy wore a pearl-gray hat with a midnight-blue band and my father 's hand-me-down double-breasted camel 's hair overcoat , and , in this getup , looked oddly Jewish . He had us drive over to a Negro undertaker 's on Lake Street . In the basement , where the undertaker worked , corpses were strewn about on tables , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . LeRoy explained to the undertaker what it was that we wanted . The undertaker , a muscular man in an undershirt and wearing a stocking cap , took out two affidavits , filled in our names and false ages , and then signed and notarized them . We each paid him $5 . Unfolded , the affidavits measuredroughly three feet long and were , of course , absolutely useless ; any bartender presented with a document of this kind would double over with raucous laughter . But we said nothing , lest we offend LeRoy , who had done the best he could . " You got it made now , " he said when we dropped him off at his apartment . A few years later , when 1 was at college , my father discovered that LeRoy , who for more than a decade had been taking off Tuesday afternoons ( with pay ) to get treatment for an advanced ease of diabetes , never had diabetes at all . Although my father regretted doing so , there was nothing for it but to fire him . However @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which Gates was correct about my having it made . While I was committed to the draftee 's bleak view of army life , the truth was though I should not have admitted it  --  that I rather liked my time at Fort Chaffee . The duty was light , except for pulling an occasional KP or guard duty . I played poker in the early part of most evenings , and won fairly steadily at it ; and read myself nearly to sleep afterward in the latrine . I was even learning to type , and taking a certain pleasure in becoming good at it . Of course , my situation was different from that of others . I had not had to leave a good job when I was drafted but instead dropped out of graduate school , which I had intended to do anyway . Nor did I leave a wife or even a regular girlfriend in Chicago . After the indolence of graduate school , the routine of the army was something of a relief . Things could have been a lot worse , especially if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jackson Gates had a wife in Detroit . Even though his hunk was next to mine , he never mentioned being married . Nor could I remember , at mail call , his named being yelled out for regular letters , as was the case with most married men among the trainees . I only first learned about Gates 's marriage when Otis Cook , a light-skinned and rather heavyset Negro in our barracks , with whom Gates usually ate in the mess hall . told me that Gates had just received a Dear John letter from his wife and was getting emergency leave to return to Detroit to try to patch things up . The reason that Cook was telling me this was that he was collecting from everyone in the barracks to get up some money for Jackson to get home on . I gave him twenty bucks , out of my poker winnings . Gates was to leave for Detroit the next day , a Saturday , after inspection . He seemed defeated befoie he left  --  as who in his place would not have been  --  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together . Dressed in his greens and bulky army overcoat , he left amid our calls of good luck . If I thought it at all strange that he had bothered to take along on so dour a mission a recent PX acquisition , his portable hi-fi , I did n't , in my sympathy for the poor guy , choose to dwell on it . As my mother 's Aunt Sophie used to say , " Go understand the shvarizers ! " While Gates was in Detroit , I spent the worst day of my two years in the army . It was a day of KP , which started out like all such days , except that I did not get the job 1 had come to prefer on KP , that of scrubbing pots and pans . I preferred it because , while it involved the most drudgery , it also involved , so unrelievedly dreary was it recognized to be , the least harassment . Instead I had to take the job of dining-room orderly , which involved setting and cleaning off tables , mopping floors , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , replacing condiments . Under a tough mess sergeant it meant a number of additional chores as well . And our mess hall , a large one shared by four different companies , had a tough mess sergeant : a short man , a Negro from New York of compact build and yellowish color with the misleadingly soft name of Larry Winslow . It looked to be the normal grueling fifteen-hour day on KP , but Sergeant Winslow had added a new twist to the usual torture . After our dining-room chores following lunch were finished , instead of allowing us a short break , he put the eight dining-room orderlies to the tedious and knuckle-busting job of rubbing down his huge black ovens with steel wool . To what purpose we did this was unclear , yet the job , because you could not determine if you were making any progress on it  --  you just kept rubbing those frigging ovens , which did n't get any shinier or any duller  --  was impossible to concentrate on for long . Winslow caught us joking about the endlessness of the job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passion in it , he warned that if he caught us again we could expect to spend the entire night working in his kitchen . I doubt that there was anyone among us who did not believe in his ability to make good on the threat , but the tedium of the task simply proved too much . Half-an-hour later we were joking again . None of us noticed Sergeant Winslow approach from behind . " More grab-assin ' , I see , " he said in that terrific calm voice . " All right . You will all spend the night taking off the old wax from these floors and rewaxing them . " And so we did . We worked till 5:30 the next morning , a full twenty-four-hour shift , knocking off only when the next day 's KPs came on , leaving us bleary-eyed and with time enough only to shave and change into fresh fatigues for the day 's classes . Everyone who has put in his time in the army has run into a man of quiet but quite earnest cruelty like Sergeant Winslow , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because , two weeks after our twenty-four-hour KP shift , when we were given our first pass into the town of Fort Smith , I saw the fearsome Sergeant Winslow . He was driving through town in a current year 's white Buick convertible . The top was down and he was laughing and sharing a feeling of comfortable cordiality with a companion who turned out to be my old bunk-mate , Private Jackson Gates . This glimpse of him on obviously chummy terms with Sergeant Winslow altered my opinion of Gates . But then , my opinion of Gates regularly underwent alterations . While we were at Chaffee , a Liston-Patterson title bout was scheduled , and near the day of the fight I stood a few men down from Gates in the chow line at lunch . He talked about the fight with great authority . Doing a bit of fancy footwork , feigning and snorting in a shadowboxing dance , he allowed as how , hack in Detroit , he had had five professional fights as a middleweight . Bull , I said to myself . Then I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fights , two by knockout , and after the last knew it was time to get out before he had his brains permanently scrambled . Artful bull , I thought , but still bull . Yet not long after Gates returned from his trip home to save his marriage  --  a trip whose outcome , along with my twenty bucks , was never mentioned  --  he began wearing a T-shirt across the front of which was printed " Detroit Golden Gloves 1957 . " Could he have had those pro fights ? Who , with Gates , knew ? W HAT WAS KNOWN was an extraordinary performance that Gates had put on in the company commander 's office . I myself learned about it from Mary Gradman , the company clerk , who had been a ZBT at the University of Illinois , as I had been at the University of Michigan . Gates . as Gradman told the story , had requested permission to speak with the " old man . " I put quotes around " old man " because he , our company commander , was a first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ University in Alabama and who could not have been more than twenty-five , or two years older than most of us in clerk-typist school . He was blond , the old man , with perfect teeth and well turned-out in his tailored and starched fatigues . He had , as Gradman explained , less than ninety days to serve before returning to Mobile , Alabama , a fiancee , and a profitable family construction business . Never very wide-ranging in his interests to begin with , the old man , according to Mary Gradman , at this time had only one thing on his mind : getting the hell out of the army and back to Mobile with as little complication as possible . Since the old man had not a ghost of a clue who Jackson Gates was , one has to imagine his surprise when Gates , this strange-looking creature in thick black-framed glasses , shows up before his desk , pops him a salute that would have been overdone if offered to Benito Mussolini , and , after his salute was limply returned , began : " Sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am here is to report acts of racial discrimination against myself in this company , sir ! I do not want at this time to go into any detail about these acts , sir ! I have considered reporting them to my uncle , Mr. Samuel Gates , attorney-at-law and executive secretary of the Greater Detroit Chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People , sir ! But I do not wish to be a bitcher. sir ! No , sir ! Instead , sir , knowing that you are a white man from Alabama and I am a Negro from Detroit , sir , I thought I would show you some of the best damn soldiering you ever seen out of any draftee , white or black , sir ! " And with this , Gates , still at rigor mortis attention , clicked his heels , popped another extravagant salute , executed an about-face of furious agility , and marched out of the old man 's office . The old man 's mouth had not yet closed when Gradman , having been rung on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " the old man drawled , " what in the cotton-pickin ' hell was that all about ? " Whatever it was , it was decidedly not something that was going to keep the old man from getting back to Mobile in eighty-odd days . Suddenly , at morning lineups and elsewhere , Private Jackson Gates emerged from obscurity . " Okay , Gates , " the first sergeant announced , " march the men off to class . " " Gates , " the sergeant in charge of Saturday morning RE . called out , " help me demonstrate to these young troopers how a push-up ought to be done . Watch Gates , men . " " All right , Gates , you take over as sergeant of the guard . Assign the shifts . But you 're not to walk any guard yourself . " To pick up an extra $20 or $25 Gates would every so often contract to do guard duty for someone else in the barracks . Easy money forhim , since he never actually had to walk shifts himself  --  he could count @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to dress for it . One weekend , when he had taken on someone else 's guard duty under these terms , he found he had no clean dress shirt and asked if he could borrow one of mine , which he promised to have laundered and back to me before the week was out . I handed him a shirt from out of my footlocker . " Thanks , baby , " he said . " I wo n't forget it . " Although our bunks were next to each other , Gates and I could scarcely be said to be friends . He for the most part hung around with the seven or eight Negroes in the company  --  and , on weekends , or so 1 gathered , with Sergeant Winslow . What conversation we had was the usual common grousing , complaints about the food , or the weather , or army life in general . When he came in late  --  where from . I still had no idea  --  he would greet me in the latrine with a perfunctory " How ya makin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " That , though , was about the extent of it . But with my loaning Gates a shirt for guard duty , I sensed a slight change in him toward me ; if not precisely a new friendliness , then a recognition that I was n't just another white face . One Saturday morning , when I was running late for inspection , I was hurriedly straightening out my footlocker and looked up to find that Gates , without being asked , was making my bed . I was touched . N OT THAT ANY REAL FRIENDSHIP between us was likely to develop . Less than four of our sixteen weeks of clerk-typist school remained , at which time we would all be shipped out of Fort Chaffee to work as company clerks or in headquarters companies on other posts . In 1959 there was no war , and no serious threat of war . The only question was where each of us would be assigned : some dreary hole like Fort Bliss , Texas , or Fort Polk , Louisiana , or Fort Benning , Georgia ; or Korea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of some leave-time in Japan ; or , plum of plums , Europe , anywhere in Europe . Early one Saturday afternoon Gates and I were alone in the barracks . An Erroll Garner record was playing on his hi-fi . 1 was writing a letter home and Gates was sitting on the edge of his bunk shining a pair of boots when he asked me where I hoped to be transferred to after clerk-typist school . " Anywhere in Europe would be great , " I said . " What about you ? " " I 'm heading back home to Detroit , " he said . He said this with absolute confidence . " How can you be sure ? " " ' Cause it already been taken care of . " Gates admired the shined boot , put it down , picked up its mate . " No sweat , daddy . " When I pressed him , Cates told me that through his friend Larry Winslow he had got to know another sergeant at G-1 , personnel , where all the transfer orders were cut . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my man at G-1 . " " Jackson , do you think your man could find a way to get me to Europe ? If he can swing it , tell him there 's three hundred in it for him . And , by the way , there 's another two hundred in it for you . " I had blurted it out , said it without thinking about it , almost as if by instinct . But now that I had said it , I did not wish to withdraw what I had said . The quality of the next eighteen months of my life hinged on where I would be sent . Would they be lively or dead months ? Eighteen months in Germany or France as opposed to eighteen months in Texas or Missouri made all the difference in the world . As for the money I had promised Gates , well , 1 had poker winnings stowed away of more than $250 ; and the remainder I could get from friends in Chicago , or if need be from my parents . Of course , Gates could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing anyway . But then again he might not be , in which case I would have been foolish to have said nothing . As long as no money passed hands , it was worth a try . " No harm my asking the cat , " Gates said . " We 'll get back to you on it , hear ? " Gates was apparently in no great hurry . A week went by without my hearing anything further from him . My mind , meanwhile , feasted on fantasies of weekends in Paris , London , Rome : myself seated before a small glass filled with amber liquid at twilight at the Brasserie Lipp ; being fitted for an elegant and indestructible English suit on Jermyn Street , Savile Row ; dashing about on a Vespa in the neighborhood of Vatican City . The contrast with the likely alternatives  --  beery weekends in Rollins , Missouri , tattoo shops in Killeen , Texas  --  was more than demoralizing . My patience ran out . " Jackson , " I asked one morning as we walked back from chow , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me to Europe ? " " I told him about you , baby . Told him you ofay but okay . He say he gon na look into it . He supposed to let me know tonight . " I awaited Gates that night in the latrine . I tried to read Turgenev , but it was no go . My mind drifted to tableaux of myself squirting wine into my mouth from a leather pouch in Andalusia , strolling leisurely among the tablesat Blackwell 's in Oxford , skiing in Austria . Around 11:30 Gates walked in . " What 's happenin ' , daddy ? " " My question to you exactly , Jackson . " " How do Brussels , Belgium , sound , daddy ? " " Really ? Brussels ? It sounds beautiful . Tell me more . " " They need typists at something called NATO headquarters there  --  eight of them . My man says , why should n't you be one of them typists ? Trouble is , there ai n't no American base in Brussels , so you 'll got to live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Knowing this made it all the sweeter , Gates flashed a gold-toothed smile . " What about the money ? Docs your man want it now ? " Much as I ached for Brussels , I was still wary of being conned . Important to keep my head here . " Not yet , " Gates said . " He says wait till the final orders is cut  --  that 'll be time enough to pay him . " " Jackson , I 'm very grateful to you for this . I want you to know that . " " No big deal , baby . I say , if you can help a cat , why not help a cat ? " " What about your two hundred ? Do you need it now ? " " Keep it , man , you 'll be needing it in Europe . One day maybe you 'll find a way to return the favor . " a My condition was one of edgy ecstasy . Brussels ! Wonderful ! I pictured the map of Europe and placed Brussels central on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We had seventeen days left at Chaffee . Orders , we were told , would be issued in fifteen days . In fifteen days , then , I would know for certain . As the days dragged on , I found myself wanting to ask Gates if things were proceeding as planned . But I hesitated to do so , lest I seem a pest , or , as bad , somehow uncool . Instead I asked him about his own plans to return to Detroit . " The cat has it fixed up for me to work in a recruiting office about a mile from where I live . It gon na be sweet , baby , real sweet . You can have Europe , daddy . Detroit is Paris enough for me . " I could have Europe . I read hope in that line . Oh , I would take it . Yes . Yes . Yes . Give me Europe . But my hope was mixed with dread that it would n't come off ; dread of scandal ; dread of some illness that would keep me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would lose back my winnings and not have the money to pay off Gates 's man at G-1 . I could no longer concentrate on my reading , and so went to bed at lights-out , where I alternated thoughts of European delight ( a Belgian mis-tress ) with U.S. disaster ( venereal disease in Oklahoma ) . The days crept on . With six to go I asked Gates if he had heard anything about orders having been cut , on the thin pretext of wondering if his man wanted his money yet . " Stay cool , daddy , stay cool . He 'll let me know when he need the bread . " W ITH THREE DAYS to go , Gates told me he wanted a word with me outside the barracks . " Orders is cut , " he said . " Like the man promised , yours is for NATO headquarters , Brussels , Belgium . Mine is for Detroit , Michigan , U.S. of A. " " What about the money ? " " He says he do n't need it till after you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think maybe it 's a good idea to give him half now , the other half after the orders is posted . Anyways , that 's what I going to do  --  to show the man appreciation for the trouble he gone through . " This was the first indication I had that Gates , like me , was coming up with money . Somehow , foolishly , I thought that his being a Negro , as I assumed the sergeant in G-1 was , would get him the transfer to Detroit for nothing . We were , then , Gates and I , in the same boat . It made his not taking the $200 from me for setting this up all the more impressive . I went back into the barracks and took my poker winnings from where I had them hidden , in the pages of the Penguin edition of Felix Holt , counted out seven twenties and a ten , and brought it back out to Gates . " Thanks , Jackson , " I said , " for everything . " We shook hands . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no sweat . " Orders were to be posted on the bulletin board outside the orderly room on Saturday afternoon after chow . Sunday and Monday we would draw travel vouchers and ship out to our new assignments . I rather hoped that I might have a day between flights in New York to spend with college friends . If not , all right ; but still , a day in Manhattan would be nice . I was on my way to the bulletin board outside the orderly room , trying to control myself from breaking into a run , when I passed Walt Doherty , who was in my platoon in basic at Leonard Wood . He was angry . " Something wrong , Walt ? " " Fuckin ' A , something 's wrong . I 'm being sent to fuckin ' Fort Hood right in the middle of fuckin ' Texas . " " That 's really lousy luck , " I said . " Save your sympathy for yourself , " he said . " You 're going there , too . " " What ? Are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you are . " I ran the rest of the way over to the orderly room . A crowd had gathered in front of the bulletin board . Names were listed in alphabetical order with destinations for each man marked on the right-hand side of the page alongside his name . Easily the majority of our company were being sent off to Fort Hood . When I found my own name , so , damn it , was I. What about Gates ? I looked down the list ; I looked down it again . Cates , Jackson , was not on it . I walked back to the barracks in a daze . No Europe  --  Texas ! Gates better have some explanation . At a minimum , I would get my money back , or goddamn know the reason why . Eighteen months of Texas loomed unrelievedly ahead . I walked faster , then broke into a sprint . Gates 's bunk was stripped , the blankets and sheets gone , the mattress turned back against the foot of the bed . The door of his locker was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few hangers . Six or seven guys were in the barracks . Over in the far corner I saw Otis Cook , who had collected money for Gates 's , return to Detroit after receiving his Dear John letter . Otis was packing his gear , and looked up as I approached . " Where they sending you ? " " Fort Hood , " I said , becoming by now half-accustomed to the dismal idea . " Me too . Supposed to be a place loaded with snakes . Ai n't my idea of much of a place to be . " " Otis , have you seen Jackson Gates ? I need to talk with him . " " Too late , man . Jackson went home early this morning , back to Detroit . " " I did n't see his name on the orders sheet . " " That 's ' cause he got him a Section 8 . Jackson done psychoed himself out . " " Gates psychoed out of the army ? " " He been taking tests the whole of the last two weeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marriage bust-up and all he 's having a nervous breakdown or something and going crazy . Jackson 's about as crazy as a fox , for my money . But I guess he convinced them . He 's gone . The crazy fox is a gone goose . " Otis stuffed a boot into his duffel bag , then began to stuff a second boot in . " See ya in Texas , man . " " Yeah , " I said , " in Texas . " I thought to add . " No sweat , daddy , " but I realized that during the next eighteen months , under the scorching Texas sun , sweating and little else was precisely what I figured to be doing . ?
