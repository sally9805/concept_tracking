" You are a liar , " said Mr. Salvatori to Mr. Unruh . Seeming to ignore this harsh observation , the gleeful Mr. Unruh continued speaking outside the curved , wrought-iron gate to Henry Salvatori 's $700,000 residence in the Bel-Air Hills of Los Angeles . Salvatori , an oil exploration ' millionaire , a big financial supporter of Gov . Ronald Reagan , and hence an influential adviser to the Governor , IR was outraged . A man 's castle is his home , and Jess Unruh , the Democratic candidate for governor of California , had rudely ventured to the very edge of the sanctuary . On this sunshiny Labor Day morning , Unruh , followed by a pack of newsmen , appeared in the Salvatori drive ? way . The " new " Jess Unruh , who vows he has come full political circle from idealist to pragmatist to idealist , had a point to make , which essentially was that the rich play and the poor pay , and more so than ever in California under the Reagan regime . Alerted by neighbors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had bounded from the tennis court and joined Mrs. Salvatori behind the closed gate . ? Thanks to Reagan 's current tax-reform proposal , Unruh told the assembled reporters , miscellaneous onlookers and the glum Salvatoris , Salvatori would save $4,113 in taxes on his Bel-Air estate , while every renter in California with an annual income of $8,000 or less would have to kick in an extra $25 a year to " Henry Salvatori 's tax-relief fund . " As Unruh went on , Salvatori emerged from behind the gate and took a position at the candi ) , date 's elbow to inject a running commentary . Salvatori : " You are a liar , ' Mr. Unruh . " Unruh plunged ahead with his speech . Salvatori : " Oh , you ass , you . " Unruh went on about " the tax loopholes enjoyed by the rich . " Salva-. tori : " I have no loopholes . " Through the grill , Mrs. Salvatori cried out , " This is what you call cheap politics , " and Salvatori turned to the newsmen : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The newspaper reporters scribbled on , and , more significantly , the television cameras hummed without pause . , TV was what this implausible encounter was all about . Unruh , the powerful Speaker , of the California Assembly when the Democrats controlled ' the state legislature , once * ' had access to plenty of money to fuel the campaigns of faithful ( to him ) Democrats . This year he may have as little to spend as $750,000 which in California is starva-tion rations for a statewide try at high office . To counter Reagan 's near monopoly on paid television , Unruh , has , . been creating " special news events " to lure the cameras . ' ' - The Salvatori confrontation turned out even better than expected ? Unruh had no idea the Salvatoris would be at home when he called . Unruh 's principal target , Reagan , was not at home when the candidate again went calling one afternoon at the Governor 's Sacramento residence  --  a place which , in a way , lent itself more cogently to Unruh 's purposes than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ election in 1966 , he abandoned the official executive mansion , a picturesque relic of the past but an old firetrap , and rented a house . Last year , when the owner wanted to sell , the Governor 's inner circle of friendly millionaires took up a collection , bought the place for $150,000 , spent another $40,000 to make it a little more livable , and rented it back to Reagan . Unruh has been using this thoughtful gesture to reinforce his argument that the Reagan administration is of the wealthy , for the wealthy , by the wealthy . It is no accident that Unruh 's tactics are a return to class-conscious politics in a state so long under the nonpartisan influence of Earl Warren . An Unruh , aide confides , " We are running the first Populist read class-conscious campaign since Upton Sinclair . " The least attentive observer must agree , and Unruh 's more conservative audiences react to him and his aspirations with great , and frequently pained , reserve . " I have nothing to offer the pocketbooks of people earning $30,000 a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seminar . And to a businessmen 's club , he said : You know and I know that under our present tax system , we have financed throligh so-called business-expense deductions a privileged style of life for an elite caste , There is absolutely no justification for , allowing such deductions as the cost of expensive night life and entertainment , the cost of lavish dining and drinking , the cost of yachts , the cost of club dues , boondoggling convention trips , and so on . Why should the taxpayers foot the bill every time a businessman spends a night on the town with a client ? Why should we allow businessmen to write off the cost of a luxury yacht when the ordinary guy ca n't even deduct the cost of a second car he needs for commuting to work  --  or even the cost of his gasoline ? Unruh won few hearts and minds , or votes , on this occasion , even when he granted that " to ' businessmen and professionals , people in the upper tax brackets , some of this may sound pretty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how many of his listeners had written off their lunch tickets as a business expense . Other Unruh thrusts : " Reagan first sold himself to the special interests and then the special interests sold him to the people . " " The Reagan administration is owned by the oil companies . " " We have to take much of the tax burden off the little guy and the middle guy . " The old Jesse Unruh ( he has dropped the " e " ) . the son of a Texas sharecropper , was once the cartoonist 's prototype of the political boss . Dubbed " Big Daddy , " he weighed nearly , 300 pounds , smoked cigars , drank consistently , and as Speaker of the Assembly for eight years , wheeled and dealed his way to power . Yet even during those years , there was another Unruh , the skilled lawmaker who reformed the creaking legislature , provided its members with research staffs and adequate salaries , undercut the influence of lobbyists , and often displayed a sympathetic approach to minorities and the poor . Despite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Unruh . He dieted away 100 pounds from his 5-foot 9-inch frame , quit the cigars , moderated the , drinking , replaced the flashy suits . These changes became more apparent after Robert Kennedy 's assassination , which had -a powerful effect on Unruh . He began to worry whether such success was worth the candle . Now 48 , Unruh said , as he started his effort to unseat the 59-year-old Reagan : " ' Big Daddy ' ran the Assembly sometimes for the good of the Democratic Party , sometimes ' for the good of the people , and sometimes for his own political good . It was a game and the people are entitled to something better than gathes , ' Big Daddy ' is gone now . " In a campaign he described from the start as an " impossible race , " Unruh has been hoping that he can needle Reagan into debate , but Reagan , the master of hard politics and the soft sell , is n't having any . Unruh has been maneuvering for a confrontation along the campaign trail , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Governor ; thus far , Reagan has sidestepped the opportunities thrust upon him . The Governor has his own , highly effective , though not unique , method of corralling votes . He will ' take an occasional cut at Unruh for " cheap demagogy , " but spends most of his time identifying himself with the popular mood of frustration over seemingly unsolvable problems . Are taxes too high ? Reagan is against high taxes . Is government too big ? He is against big government . Are welfare costs out of sight ? He is against the " welfare state , " whatever that may mean in 1970 when the government subsidizes everything from defense industry to cancer research to cancer-causing tobacco growers . Are we fed up with riots on the campus ? Reagan 's fed " right up to here " ? finger at his throat  --  and if it takes a " blood bath " to quell the students , it might be better to have it sooner than later . He instantly explained that " blood bath " was just a figure , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his horrendous choice of words may have cost him few votes . Despite an occasional lapse , Reagan comes across with an air of unshakable innocence . Four years of office have evidently left unblemished the image of the honest , talented amateur , trying his level best and opposed only by conniving professional politicians . The San Francisco Chronicle says of Reagan : " A - man of great personal sincerity and earnestness " with " a style and approach to public issues that most people seem to agree with . " Unruh concedes Reagan 's popularity , and it causes him to seethe : " The way Reagan talks , " Unruh told a news conference , " it 's almost like he has n't been Governor for the past four years . Look at the situation : taxes are up since he became Governor , the crime rate , has gone up since he became Governor , but the way he talks you 'd think he had no responsibility for any of this . It 's 394 almost as though we were running his 1966 campaign all over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little man , the average man in California under Reagan . " Things have gotten worse in California . In the past four years , welfare rolls have grown by 660,000 or nearly 57 per cent ; welfare costs have gone up by nearly $500 mil , hon , or about 68 per cent ; taxes have nearly doubled in the past decade . The combined county , state and federal welfare costs amount to $2.138 billion of which the counties contribute $382 million , the state $673 million , and the federal government pays the balance , Notwithstanding these huge expenditures , the federal government has accused the state of ducking its share of welfare costs . California has not increased its maximum payment to those qualifying for Aid to Families with Dependent Children since 1966 , and on September 11 , a federal judge ordered the state to raise the maximum by 30 per cent within sixty days , or risk the loss of some , if not all , the $1 billion it now receives annually from Washington . Reagan appealed that ruling , and the almost invariably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ characterized his position as a refusal " to give widows and orphans a cost-of-living increase . " Tax-supported education , largest item in the state budget , 27.6 per cent , is being squeezed . A few figures suggest the size of the problem . There are 104,000 students in the nine-campus university system , 244,000 in the nineteen four-year state colleges , 725,000 in the ninety-two junior colleges and 4.5 million children in the primary grades and the high schools . The state 's share of education costs has dropped in four years from 38.4 per cent to 34.8 per cent , throwing more of the burden on THE NATiori/October 26 , 1970 local property owners , whose taxes jumped about 50 per cent in the pat decade . Historically , the state paid 50 per cent of education costs in California . Hard-breathing local taxpayers are consistently voting down school money issues . All these troubles can not be attributed to Governor Reagan . The war in Vietnam , inflation , a sluggish economy  --  all have had a heavy impact  --  but there remains the question of priorities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? How are the taxes to be levied ? How are they to be spent ? Unruh proposes a gradual phasing out of all taxes on private homes , elimination of the state 's oil-depletion allowance , dropping or sharply reducing the tax preference on capital-gains income , removal of home-office tax exemptions for insurance companies , curtailment of " business-expense " deductions , and a withholding system for personal income-tax collections . In answer to a question on state expenses , Unruh suggested a cut in freeway construction  --  a revolutionary proposal in California , where the automobile ranks as an icon only below the flag . " We need , to restore , " Unruh added , " some degree of balance between the tax burden on consumers and the tax burden on business . " The state 's biggest single source of revenue is the sales tax , which rakes in 30.2 per cent of all revenue collected , and penalizes. those least able to pay . There is little evidence to indicate that Unruh is getting his message across to the lower-income groups whose cause he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much less than impossible . The odds are about fifty-fifty in the U.S. Senate contest between Sen. George Murphy and Rep. John Tunney , his Democratic opponent and son of the old heavyweight champion . Murphy , twinkly and gray-haired at 68 , is a spectacularly common common man . He was hurt politically last spring by exposure of his secret financial relationship with the right-wing Patrick Frawley , Jr. , of Technicolor . When elected to the Senate in 1964 , Murphy was on Technicolor 's payroll at $40,000 a year . After going to Washington , he quietly remained a " consultant " with Technicolor at $20,000 a year and , in addition , collected $4,000 a year as a company director . Fringe benefits also were attached . Murphy had a Technicolor credit card for cross-country trips , and the indulgent company paid half the rent on the Senator 's $530-a-month Washington apartment . It was a handsome arrangement for the handsome ex-hoofer and actor turned courtly statesman . , While Murphy was grappling with the public relations aspects of these revelations , he unexpectedly ran into opposition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a nontypical , inner-directed multimillionaire Republican , first tried to persuade Robert Finch to quit Washington and run against Murphy . Finch nibbled , but scented disaster and pulled back in terror . On the last day for filing , Simon himself jumped in . Through elaborate use of the media , but without much organization , Simon gathered 600,000 votes in just seventy-two days . He came nowhere near defeating Murphy , but his thrust was damaging and may have softened the Senator a bit for this THE NATION/October 26 , 1970 fall 's assault-by Tunney . Tunney , 36 , is a moderate in the Kennedy mold and with the Kennedy accent . Like many members of both parties , he is ' cooling off rapidly on the war in Vietnam . In the primary , he defeated peace-mongering Rep. George Brown , who had made the costly mistake of being right on the war from the start , and who was therefore nicely . tagged as a radical . He waved his defeat aside and is supporting Tunney . Other political battles in California scarcely break , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Here and there , a campaign is defining significant issues . Democrat Gary Hart is attempting to unseat Charles Teague , a sixteen-year veteran representing the Thirteenth Congressional District , which includes Santa Barbara and Ventura Counties and a tip of Los Angeles County to the south . Hart , a 27-year-old schoolteacher who managed Rep. Allard Lowenstein 's election to Congress last year in New York , is a peace candidate who also is emphasizing the environmental issue . After the big oil spill on the Santa Barbara coast , this issue grabs everyone , from Left to Right . Teague , who at one time thought it an excellent idea to bomb Haiphong harbor to end the war instantly , believes he is in no danger and spends much of his time in Washington . The district is conservative , and Teague is probably correct . Wilson C. Riles , a black , is attempting to oust . his former boss , Max Rafferty , the state 's right-wing Superintendent of Public Instruction . Riles 's campaign is all uphill , although Rafferty , since his defeat by U.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rafferty is suspicious of sex education in the schools , loves the three Rs , and is morose about most of what has happened in the country since the 18th century . He remains popular in Southern California , where the votes are . Ronald V. Dellums , another black , beat an incumbent Democrat for ' the Congressional nomination in the district that includes Berkeley . He is expected to win in a heavily ' Democratic area against an obscure opponent , despite his race and a stiffening attitude toward the campus . Former Governor Brown is supporting Unruh and , ignoring their past enmity , Brown really wants Unruh to win . But the ex-Governor is keeping a much closer watch on the race for Secretary of State , where the Democratic candidate is industriously pursuing this relatively minor post . Brown thinks the 32-year-old candidate just might be governor of California some day . His name is Edmund G. ) Brown , Jr . With California passing New York and moving into first place in political power , the election stakes are high . Democrats have a 54-to-40 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much ' 395 more casual than Republicans about crossing party lines . If the GOP can maintain its narrow control of the state legislature , the Republicans , through reapportionment , will next year be able to carve out new political districts to their advantage . Democrats now outnumber Republicans , twenty-one to seventeen , in California 's Congressional delegation , which will gain five seats as a result of the latest census . A sufficiently ingenious job of gerrymandering might enable the Republicans , to pick up several or all of them . The mood in the , state is an uncertain mixture of apathy , frustration , anger , fear and exhaustion . There is a , widespread , nagging conviction that exchanging one set of politicians for another would make little difference . The blacks in the ghettos remain deeply alienated , and there is a growing political consciousness and militancy among the Chicanos , the large and once passively resigned Mexican-American population . The killing by sheriff 's deputies of Ruben Salazar , a Los Angeles Times columnist , in the east Los Angeles riot last August @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Overkill at ' The Silver Dollar " by Enrique Hank Lopez , The Nation , October 19 . There is one staple in the public attitude : mounting rancor against student riots , black militants and rising crime ; and every candidate has a set speech on " law and order . " Nobody seems to have the answer to Vietnam , environmental pollution ( this is the worst smog season in Los Angeles in fourteen years ) and civil disorders . Anything can happen in this volatile atmosphere , and California politicians privately hedge their predictions . But one of the state 's most astute trend and politician watchers is not quite- willing to write off Jess Unruh . The reason : unemployment is up to 7 per cent , the highest level in California in ten years , and 1.5 per cent higher than the national , average . In California 's Republican heartland , Orange County , the figure is a dismal 6.7 per cent , and in neighboring Los Angeles County , 6.6 per cent . A man 's concern for his job slices across all other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the state we may yet see Ronald Reagan back on the movie lots . ?
