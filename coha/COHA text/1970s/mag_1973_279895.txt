THE PRESIDENCY / HUGH SIDEY <P> MY home town of Greenfield , Iowa , is still a pretty good place from which to look back at the White House now in its season of anguish . The village is rich in nothing so much as its black soil and enduring common sense . It is a cross section of very little except deep human feeling . Slow to anger , slow to forgive , profoundly humble from living on the unrelenting prairie , the people of Greenfield are disturbed by Richard Nixon 's presidency . <P> The impact of the new Watergate revelations is felt . But there is more . The people who stop now around the square in the first warm sun of spring seem to teeter between a quiet revulsion and a kind of muted tolerance . They still hope for the best . They do n't want the President to be disgraced . They do n't want Richard Nixon to fail . It is Nixon 's own abuse of this special grace which they hold out to him that baffles and disappoints them the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the new revelations about White House aides and former Attorney General John Mitchell . Nixon 's effort to cover it up for ten months , however , means everything . His ending of the American involvement in Viet Nam is praiseworthy . His continued bombing in Cambodia and Laos seems senseless . His cutting of small domestic programs that affect the people is understandable . His reluctance to rein in defense spending and what is often seen as his toadying to millionaires and corporate giants are discouraging . <P> His urge to enlarge his power and win his way over his adversaries in the press and Congress is nothing new in human affairs . But his disregard for tradition and good manners , his indifference to humans or institutions that get in his way , are appalling . His concern about high food prices is entirely reasonable . But allowing the blame to fall on farmers whose costs have risen astronomically over the past few years is unfair . <P> In short , almost all those singular contradictions which mark Nixon 's presidency are perceived and now raise concern in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often not even known or understood , but a rule as old as the presidency still is operative . The most telling measure of a man 's stewardship finally is himself , or at least the way he portrays himself . <P> **29;1359;TOOLONG <P> We gathered one night , friends in mourning for a young mother killed by cancer , and the talk drifted from personal tragedy to national concern . The doctor summed up what many were thinking . " I do n't know a man who does so much of what I want and whom I dislike so much , " he said of Nixon . Time and again the theme was repeated : Why must the President pursue noble objectives in such underhanded ways ? <P> " It 's the stupidity of the thing that gets me , " declared a retired druggist about Watergate . He was one of many who felt that nothing was quite so bad as the insult to the national intelligence , the degrading spectacle of their Government run by men with such small minds . <P> Not once but several times , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back voluntarily . " How 's Tricky Dicky ? " asked a farmer in the lobby of the bank . A few hours later a small businessman shook his head more in sadness than in anger and remarked , " Well , old Tricky Dicky is in a mess . "
