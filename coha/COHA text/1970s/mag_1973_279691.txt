IN Philadelphia 's white Little Italy neighborhood , homes are tax assessed at about 36% of market value . Across town , in some black areas , they are assessed at 66% of market value-meaning that the blacks are being taxed at almost twice the level as whites . <P> In city after city across the U.S. , school districts are in financial distress , often largely because of such inequitable assessments . Philadelphia 's example is illuminating . Some 13,000 teachers last week were in the second month of their third strike in three years , because of a demand for higher wages that the board of education says it can not afford to meet . The schools already have a $34 million deficit , and Mayor Frank Rizzo had sworn not to raise taxes . Yet Philadelphia could go a long way toward wiping out its deficit with no increase in the tax rate by uniformly assessing property at the higher rate . <P> There are other reasons , of course , for the financial crisis of city schools . A major one is the decay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stagnation of property values . In Chicago the tax base-the total assessed value of the city 's taxable property-edged up 22% in the past decade , while the cost of operating its schools zoomed by 123% . <P> Similar experiences in other cities resulted in a budget crunch that finally brought to a head the whole complex question of how education of all Americans can be made more nearly equal-and more equitably financed . That conundrum is now before the U.S. Supreme Court . Since 1971 , courts in seven states-Texas , Arizona , California , Michigan , Minnesota , New Jersey and Wyoming-have ruled that using local property taxes to finance public education is unconstitutional . Similar cases are pending in 24 other states . The courts reason that the quality of a child 's education should not be determined by the wealth of the district in which he lives . <P> The Supreme Court finally decided to hear the Texas suit ; it is a classic case of discrimination by pocketbook . The suit was brought by a group of parents led by Demetrio P. Rodriguez , a civil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attend Edgewood elementary school in a predominantly Mexican-American section of San Antonio . Rodriguez visited the school in 1968 and found that water fountains did not work , bathrooms had no toilet paper , science rooms had no sinks and the library was short of books . Moreover , the school 's dropout rate was 32% . <P> In the city 's white north side , however , schools were better financed . They had lower dropout rates , better equipment , higher teacher pay , athletic stadiums and air conditioning . In short , white students were getting better educational opportunities because their neighborhood could afford to foot the bill , charged Rodriguez.
