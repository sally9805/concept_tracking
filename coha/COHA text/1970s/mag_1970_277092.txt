AFTER five months of relative somnolence , Cape Kennedy was once more a scene of feverish activity . All attention last week was focused on launch pad 39A , where the Apollo 13 spacecraft rested atop a huge Saturn 5 rocket , ready to carry U.S. astronauts to their third landing on the moon . As the long countdown began , there was noticeably less excitement than had accompanied previous moon missions ; the complex Apollo launchings have already become almost routine . <P> But there is nothing routine about the mission planned for Astronauts James Lovell , Fred Haise and Ken Mattingly . It may well prove to be the most challenging test yet of man 's skills in space and on the forbidding surface of the moon .
