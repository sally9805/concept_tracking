No painter was ever more aptly named than Chuck Close . Since the late ' 60s , when his paintings of giant heads began to make him a reputation in New York City , Close has been known for one thing : a relentless inspection of the surface of the human face , recorded at immensely magnified scale , not only " warts and all " but with every pore of every wart meticulously set forth . Large and legible though they are , Close 's portraits illustrate a paradox : although faces are the most recognizable and memorable objects in the world , neither artists nor perceptual psychologists yet know for sure why we recognize them , or what makes a given face familiar . In the street , one scans a face and recognizes it from swift generalizations . No computer has yet been successfully programmed to make these generalizations ; only the human brain , apparently , can both sort out and recognize forms as complex as those of a face . But Close 's big paintings , each head 7 ft. or 8 ft. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Every feature is recorded in its tiniest particular , with the strange result that his subjects become almost unrecognizable - they are veiled by the surplus of information on the canvas . As a consequence , Close 's works are among the most troubling icons of American art in the ' 70s . He is perhaps the only artist of his generation who has really extended the meaning of portraiture . <P> Close , 36 , a tall figure with a patriarchal beard , works very slowly , his air brush patiently rendering each microform of flesh and hair like a polyp secreting coral . Each painting takes months to finish , and since 1970 Close has finished only 18 of them . Thus any show by him is an event of interest , and his current one at New York 's Pace Gallery is no disappointment . It consists of three large heads - one of Close himself , two of his friends in the art world - and a group of studies and drawings for them . Self-portrait and Klaus ( 1976 ) are in black and white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a color painting of the face of a red-haired woman in a red dress . <P> Close 's method is complex : he squares up from a large , side-lit studio mug shot of his subject , working over it first in pure red , then in blue and finally yellow ; the overlays , as in three-color printing , produce " natural " color . The camera is focused on the sitter 's eyes , and the photo 's depth of field is so small that the tip of the nose blurs , and one can see as many differences of sharpness in Close 's beard or Linda 's tangle of rusty curls as among the stalks of a wheatfield . These blurs and elisions are rendered with exquisite accuracy . <P> Flaky Skin . Close 's mixture of size and precision is disorienting . Faces would look like this to a louse , if lice could scan them : a fleshy landscape , dried salt pans of flaky skin , monstrous glittering folds of mucous membrane , each wrinkle a canyon , the nose a mountain , lakes for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once , and it has a lot to offer on how we scan , decode and see the most ordinary configurations . Held in memory . Close 's por traits marginally change every face one glimpses in the subway , or in a mirror .
