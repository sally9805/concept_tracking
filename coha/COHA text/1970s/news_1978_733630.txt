txt EIGHT ILLINOIS Board of Education consultants , predicting that Chicago public schools will be down to 12.5 per cent white enrollment in In years . have urged passage of a state law requiring all sub . urban schools with space In accept minority children bused from the city . The consultants , hired lo analyze the Chicago desegregation plan , not only said the proposal fails to meet stale rules , but also emphasized that a metro , politnn remedy is the only hope for integrated education for large numbers pf minority children in the city . The Menge plan proposes  --  a variety of voluntary programs , such as magnet schools , career centers , academic interest centers , and transfers from overcrowded schools to others With space only within the city . " In the long run , there will be little ' desegregation unless there is an areawide " - plan with mandated reassignments , " said the report of eight consultants , headed by Gary Orfield , associate professor of political science at the University of Illinnis Champaign-Urbana campus . The consultants recommended " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ area with available space to welcome a number of transfer students to increase ciesegregalion . " They urged that state aid he paid both to districts who send and receive the students . A COURT SUIT seeking an order for metropolitan desegregation also was urged . " It is time for the Chicago Board of Education , officials in inner suburban communities , civil rights organizations , and federal agencies to begin consider . ing legal action ( or a metropolitan plan , " the consultants said . " The obstacles to such a plan are great , but in the long run , it is the most , sensible and workable option that remains . " As a result of the nationwide trend of declining enrollment because of plunging birth rates . suburban schools have IMAM vacant seats , the consultants said . " They could . in other words , house 37 per cent of Chicago students %%ala any new buildings , " they added . These seats primarily are in Omenlary schools " where desegregation is easiest and most successful , " Ihe consultants said . " At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ space in schools within the city near the suburban line , schools that could he used as special schools to draw suburban students into the city . " AS FOR Chicago , the consultants said . " If the existing demographic trends continue In operate ? and they have been - moving consistently in the same direction for decades  --  seven-eighths of the students in the Chicago public schools In // Advisers urge city-to-suburb busing // years from now will be black , Latino , or Asian . In the long run it seems apparent that integrated education for most minority children will require plans that bring together students across school district lines . " ' Discussing birth patterns in Chicago , the consultants said , " The average white woman still living in Chicago is past her child-bearing years but the average minority woman is not . Moreover , minority families , particularly Latino families , have substantially larger families . " Thus even if no one moved , the minority concentration in the Chicago schools would grow and the number of white children would decline . " Chicago public schools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rate of 11/2 to 2 per cent a year . STATE DESEGREGATION rules requiring that every school be within 15 per cent of the district 's racial makeup , has virtually no impact on communities with few minority residents , the consultants said . " If all schools in Chicago , for instance , are required to have 65-95 per cent minority enrollment to be desegregated , while those in the first ring of suburbs must have 10-40 per cent minority children , and those in the second and third rings require no desegregation at all to comply with state law , the policy only reinforces the white suburbanizelion trend , " they emphasized . A number of cities  --  Boston , Milwaukee , and Hartford , Conn. , among them ? have small city-suburban busing plans . " No city has yet tested a more advanced form of metropolitan open enrollment which would require all subOrbs to offer opportunities to transfer and require provision of free bus transportation , " the consultants said . School Superintendent Joseph P. Ilannon 's plan " proposes only a very tiny effort to involve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years , 500 minority children would be attending suburban Schools under proposed voluntary agreements . A STATE LAW requiring suburban schools with space to open their doors to Chicago minority children would produce " a positive kind of voluntary integration which would present very few difficulties and would be a first step in creating consciousness of the metropolitan dimension of educational segregalion , " the consultants said . Such a transfer plan could result in shifting enrollment decline problems from the suburbs to the city , allowing suburbs to retain teachers and schools while the city loses resources , the consultants said . " These difficulties could be avoided with a policy providing full state aid to both sending and receiving districts , thus permitting districts losing students to lower class sizes for those remaining , " they said . Despite the consultants ' opinion that the Chicago plan fails to , meet state rules , Joseph M. Cronin , state superintendent of education , said the plan may be acceptable for the first year if Hannon provides written assurances that the proposal 's components will have a racial mix . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ declined to say whether it will contain the assurances that Cronin wants .
