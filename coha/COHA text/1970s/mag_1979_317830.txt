Despite the new hustling , Carter 's home town resists change <P> Novelist Reynolds Price ( A Long and Happy Life , The Surface of Earth ) went to Plains , Ga. , two years ago to report for TIME on President Carter 's home town . A native of North Carolina himself , Price returned to Plains recently to see what change the presidency has wrought . <P> " I first came down here from Macon County more than 30 years ago to nurse my cousin who was having a baby , " says the fiftyish waitress who serves me my first cup of coffee on Main Street . " Now I ca n't even find the house I came to . Plains has changed that much - and all just lately . I think it 's grand . " <P> On my own first visit to Plains two years ago , the town was mostly elated at its sudden fame . The nine old brick stores on Main Street , some disused for years , had opened hastily with a limited stock of Carter souvenirs , all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which had been campaign headquarters , was a welcoming center that offered the admirably unpredictable Miss Lillian for several hours each day of autographs and bracingly candid talk with the few bellwether tourists . <P> Up the way , Jimmy ( as everyone called him ) was in his own low , rambling house , making Cabinet choices to the accompaniment of comic gallops by the baffled world press up and down the narrow streets to interview job hopefuls , then on to the nearest motels in Americus ( ten miles away ) for sparse rest and food . The food came , famously , from the now legendary Faye 's Bar-B-Q Villa-a good steak served in the Formica rooms of a " double-wide mobile home " parked in a mud lot behind a filling station near some rotting tourist cabins . <P> Yet for all the excitement , the media cynicism , the physical groanings-at-the-seams , one could strike off alone and explore the town and countryside , finding the various unadorned sites of Jimmy 's life and early work . A polite visitor with an anxiety-dispelling Southern accent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the presidential family . In a three-day visit-during Christmas rush at that-I had cordial and substantial meetings with Alton Carter ( Jimmy 's uncle and keeper of the family tales , possessed of an excellent narrative tongue and the sweet will to use it ) ; Gloria Carter Spann ( Jimmy 's nearest sister , wife to a Plains farmer and the most retiring and impressive of the circle ) ; Miss Allie Smith ( Rosalynn 's serene but clearly strong mother ) ; and Jimmy and Rosalynn themselves ( attentive as radar stations on the DEW line and pleasanter ) .
