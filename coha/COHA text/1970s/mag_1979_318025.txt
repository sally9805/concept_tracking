Troubles in Iran threaten higher energy prices and slower growth <P> Beyond the fate of the hostages in Tehran , a new worry loomed last week : Was the energy-squeezed and inflation-dazed world economy about to fall victim to the crisis between the U.S. and Iran ? Though the U.S. 's cutoff of imports from Iran and its seizure of that nation 's assets in U.S. banks was a necessary response to irrational provocations , the actions also transformed petrodollars and petroleum itself into even more dangerous weapons in economic brinksmanship . That , in turn , added a new and alarming element to the crisis . <P> Tremors of foreboding spread through money markets from Tokyo to Bahrain . The dollar plunged steeply on initial reports that Iran would withdraw its deposits from U.S. banks , then rebounded in nervous surprise at the news that Washington was freezing the assets before they could be withdrawn . When rumors circulated in Europe and New York that Iran would counteract the move by refusing to accept dollars as payment for its oil delivered to any nation , the U.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traders passed the week wearing looks of astonishment at what might come next . <P> In the U.S. , concern focused primarily on what effect the boycott of Iranian oil would have on the domestic economy . Would long gasoline lines return ? Would prices for fuels of all sorts take another breathless leap ? Would inflation surge , interest rates rise and the economy slip deeper into recession ? <P> Under normal circumstances , neither of the U.S. 's actions should lead to such results . Oil imports from Iran amount to a scant 4% of total U.S. consumption . In theory , at least , those purchases could be easily replaced by swapping : oil companies could exchange Iranian crude with other companies that have equal amounts of non-Iranian petroleum . Nor in theory should the freezing of Iranian bank assets prove especially disruptive to money markets or the banking system . The Tehran government 's estimated $6 billion in petrodollar holdings is only a fraction of the more than $150 billion that big international banks move back and forth among each other every day . Withdrawing the Iranian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than a momentary ripple . <P> In fact , the rising stakes in the Iranian mess are almost certain to put alarming new stresses on both the U.S. economy and the world financial system . Asserts Economist Otto Eckstein , president of Data Resources Inc. : " The direct impact of the U.S. 's actions is obviously small . But the unfortunate experience of the past few years has been that every political problem involving an energy-producing nation ultimately converts itself into a further upset in the oil market and a further upset in prices . " <P> For the U.S. , which is still hurting from the two-month loss of Iranian crude earlier this year , almost any new interruption in supply , no matter how modest or brief , will lead to tighter markets and higher prices . In their present jittery state , Americans are ready to start topping off gas tanks for almost any reason . Not only does the memory of a summer spent in gas lines remain fresh and infuriating , but so does the specter of the 1973 Arab embargo , which ushered in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
