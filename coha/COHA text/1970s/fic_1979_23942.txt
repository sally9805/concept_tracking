RAGS &; BONES A short story WOMAN named Beryl Fels recently picked up an old tin chest in a junk shop . When she got it home to her flat she found it contained letters . She telephoned friends and had something more amusing to exchange than news of business trips and children 's colds . " What do you do with other people 's letters ? " " Take them back " ? but that was a stupid answer . Back where ? The old man who ran the shop would n't know to whom they belonged ; these rag-and-bone men would n't tell a buyer , ever , where they found the things they scavenged from house sales , pawnshops , and people more in need of money than of possessions whose associations they either did not know or no longer cared about . " Read them . Oh , of course , read them . " The antiquarian hookdealer was at once in character ; he was good fun , this permanently young man of forty-five , homosexual and bibliophile . He and Beryl Fels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plausible if inauthentic couple . " Burn them , I suppose  --  what else could one do ? " the lying rectitude of a most de-vious woman , who eavesdropped on her adolescent children 's telephone conversations . " What did you want a tin chest for ? " ? this from someone who had no leisure to spend Saturday mornings pottering about among bric-a-brac and making trips across town to some special shop where one could buy a particular cheese or discover a good inexpensive wine not easy to get . Beryl Fels had thought the chest would be the thing to hold spare keys , fuse wire , picturehooks . Living without a man , she was as efficient as any male about household maintenance , no trouble at all to her , although her hands were creamed and manicured , as perfectly inutile-looking as any man with an ideal of femininity could have wished for . She had been on the lookout for something that would clear from her lovely yellow-wood desk ( another Saturday morning find ) a miscellany that did n't belong there . Some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been , once . All were addressed to the same name , a woman 's , and to a box number in one town , or poste restante in other towns and even , she saw , in other countries . She had not thought of the chest as a receptacle for letters . But of course if one were to have so many letters to keep ! She counted : 307 letters and 9 postcards . And telegrams , many telegrams , some stuffed into their original orange , window envelopes . There is something queer about preserving telegrams ; she held them : at once urgent and old , they do n't keep . She read one ; telegrams are hardly private , the words counted out by a post office clerk under the public eye . It was terse and unsigned , a date , a time , a railway station platform number , a cryptic addition whose message was not very difficult to guess . Yes yes yes . A lover 's affirmation . What can 307 letters be but love letters ? And it seemed that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the chest  --  some were wadded as if they had lain pushed behind heavy objects . Someone had found them , perhaps , and tossed them into the tin chest that the woman to whom they had been written did n't own . Beryl Fels saw , as she tipped them all out , that they had been thrown in carelessly in reverse order , the top of the pile was at the bottom of the chest , and there was the very sheet of paper ( the old foolscap size ) with the instruction that would have met the eye of anyone on opening the drawer or lifting the lid of the place where the letters originally would have been kept . These letters and documents are to be preserved unread until twenty years after the date of my death , and then are to be presented to an appropriate library or archives . The signature was the name on the envelopes . The postmarks the letters were not in chro-nological order anymore , so one would have to go through the lot to see how long the affair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explained why the telegram she 'd read gave a railway station platform number rather than a flight number ) . If the woman had died then , the embargo was lapsed . If she were still alive , she certainly would have destroyed her letters rather than let them out of her hands . ERYL FELS began to read while she drank her coffee late on Sunday morning . She did not get out of her dressing gown or make her bed or tend her balcony herb garden to the sound of Mozart or punk rock ( she was interested in everything that was a craze or passion in other people 's lives ) , as she usually did on Sundays . She had had two invitations to lunch at the homes of couples , one hetero- the other homosexual , options she had left open to herself if a preferable third  --  she was a free agent ? did not turn up , but she did not go out and ate no lunch . At times , while she read , her heart made itself heard in her ears like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The tendons behind her knees were tense and her long-nailed forefinger stroked the wings of her nose , which felt warm and greasy . The woman to whom the letters were written was not just anybody ; the man who wrote them was her confidant and critic as well as her lover . He wrote most passionately when he had just had the experience of hearing her praised by people who did not know he knew her . He wanted terribly to make love to her , he said , when he saw her up there on the platform giving a lecture , with her glasses hiding her eyes from everybody . He felt himself swelling when he saw her name in print . Whole long letters analyzed the behavior of people who would , he felt , do this rather than that , express themselves in these words and gestures rather than those , were " there " or " simply not there . " It became clear these were characters in a novel or play : she was a writer . And he  --  he seemed to have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was difficult , without having access to her letters to him , to discover what exactly it was he hoped to achieve , what it was that he was climbing toward over the years the letters covered . There was the impression that the specialized nature of his work was something his mistress did not have the type of intellect or education to follow , despite her brilliance , attested to in every letter , and her success , which was as strong an erotic stimulus as whatever beauty she might have had . c " ... against that field of female cabbages your face was stamped out like a fern " ? he strained to be literary , too . ) But that she was ambitious for him , that she jealously bristled when others received promotions , awards , honors that lie was in the running for , was plain from the passages in his letters calming her with his more stoic , cynical view of talents and rewards in his field . To her lie unburdened himself scatologically of all the malice he felt  --  he and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he certainly would n't stoop to . She also consoled ; he found endearing  --  and did not deny , since no doubt he knew his worth  --  her assurances that whatever small kudos others might pick up on the way , he would get one of the Nobel Prizes one day . At some stage he did receive some signal honor for his work ; as a lover he took what evidently must have been her stern triumphant pride as a new and particularly voluptuous kind of caress between them ; and at the same time he was concealing from himself , in order to enjoy the triumph unalloyed , the knowledge that she was not fitted to judge the scale of such achievements or the significance of such honors . This last came out in certain small , embarrassed phrases , or half-sentences scoredover but not made illegible ( as if he could n't bear to have secrets from her , not even those he was concealing for both of them ) . The stranger , reading , took up the pathetic cunning of these phrases and half-remarks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman to whom they were addressed the grit of doubt would be enveloped in emotion and mutual self-esteem as the lubrication of the eye coats tiny foreign bodies and prevents them from irritating the eyeball . The distinguished woman schemed to attend the ceremony at which her lover was to be honored ; letters covering the wrangling of a whole month between them first persuaded , finally implored her to give up the idea . " Even if you could approach Faragar through Ebenstein , how can he not smell a rat ? A bedroom rat , quite frankly , my love . Only members of the Society and their wives will be present . The press ! They do n't come to things like this . It 's not exactly a world-shaking event . They get a handout , perhaps , with the list of awards , afterward . And since when have you been known as a journalist ? Why on earth should you suddenly express great interest in the proceedings of the Society ? You 'd be recognized at once by someone who 's seen your photograph on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start sniffing around for a connection , the reason for your being there . And how could we not look at each other ? You know it 's impossible . You 're not just anybody , even if you sometimes want to be . " And in answer to what must have been resentful disappointment : " There are some things we ca n't have . As you often say , we have so much ; more than other people can even dream of , I 'm superstitious to spell it out , not only us , ' our great joy in each other 's bodies and friendship , but success and real achievement  --  certainly you , my darling , I am well aware , quite objectively , you are one of the great names coming .... If we do n't suffer the attrition of farmyard domesticity , then we ca n't have the sort of public display of participation in each other 's achievements married couples have  --  and most of the time it 's all they do have . Why should you want to sit like some faculty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sleep with her and ca n't talk to her anymore ) wearing an appropriate smile for the occasion , as she does a hat .... " Again , she must have wanted to dedicate a book to him . He tormentedly regretted he must forgo this . " No matter how you juggle initials or code names known only to us , you give away our private world . You acknowledge its existence , to others . Let 's keep it as we 've managed to do for nearly five years . Separately , we are both people in the public eye , it 's the price or the reward , God knows , of what we both happen to be . Let the media scrabble and speculate over those . I know that book is mine ; and it is my posterity . " T FIVE in the afternoon Beryl Fels read the last letter . It was not one of the momentous ones  --  reflected no crisis nor was it the type of note , strangled terse with erotic excitement , that immediately preceded planned meetings . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was thinking about his damned lecture for the Hong Kong conference ; he 'd read only five pages ( this must refer to , somepiece of her work she had given him ) but could not wait to tell her how moving in a new way and at the same time witty ... hence the scribble .... Beryl Fels stood up . Belches kept rising from her empty stomach . Outlines in the room jumped . Thirteen cigarette stubs  --  she counted dully  --  in the ashtray . The dazedness came from the change of focus for her eyes : there were her other " finds " around her , to establish the equilibrium of her own existence . She gazed at her beautiful yellow-wood desk , subdued in its presence as if , entering into the past of other lives , she had dislodged the order of her own and retrogressed to the shallow-breathing stillness of being caught out , brought back to the angles and polished surfaces of the headmistress 's study from blurred , fearful pleasures in an overgrown corner of a garden . She put her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ odor on the fingers . Running a bath , making her neglected bed , and choosing one of her silk shirts to wear with trousers provided the routine ( she often bathed and changed at this time of day , just home from work ) that accomplished the shift from the experience of reading the letters to an interpretation appropriate to her well-arranged life . Like the other finds  --  the desk perfectly at borne between balcony door and lyre-backed chair this one found its place . It became one of her interests and diversions as a lively personality . A pity the day was Sunday : she could have telephoned the public library to ask if they had any of the woman 's books . She could have gone down at once herself , to read up about her . Perhaps the identity of the man was known , to people more widely read than she was . If not , the letters might be even more important  --  a discovery , even a literary sensation , as well as a find . She telephoned her bookdealer friend again and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some party on a Sunday evening , he was asked everywhere . Having overcome an unusual ( for her ) reluctance to talk to anybody  --  it just showed how one needs to get out and among people , how quickly solitude takes hold  --  Beryl Fels impatiently awaited Monday morning . N THE WEEK that followed , she asked her antiquarian bookdealer friend and the chief librarians at the public library and a university library ( both acquaintances ) about the woman writer . None of these had heard of her . Each was cautious to say so ; each uneasy , unless this pat ignorance should prove to be a professional lapse , the name that of some esoteric but important writers ' writer he should have known . But library catalogues revealed that not a single book by anyone of that name was on the shelves or even in the store , the morgue stacks from which books no longer in general demand were taken out for borrowers on special request . The antiquarian bookdealer did dig up , in some old publisher 's catalogue , the title @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of print . The title rang no bell for anyone . Determinedly , so good at tracking down things she wanted , Beryl Fels got someone to introduce her to a professor in the science faculty at the university . She did not show him her find but jotted down for him all the facts gleaned from the letters that could lead to an identification of the other personality who made up the pair of distinguished lovers . There was no one , no one at all fitting the given period , field of activity ( quickly established as geophysics ) , and country of origin whose work was sufficiently original or important for his name to be known . There was certainly no one , in the list of Nobel Prize winners for science , who could have been or could be him  --  should he still be alive . The antiquarian bookdealer said she should keep the letters anyway . " Beryl darling , for our grandchildren  --  if any . " He was conducting one of the unruly lunches expected at his table , and timed the laugh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letters written by ordinary people become salable if you wait fifty years or so . Like old seaside postcards . Laundry lists . Do n't I know ? How else could I afford to give you all such a good meal ? People will collect anything . "
