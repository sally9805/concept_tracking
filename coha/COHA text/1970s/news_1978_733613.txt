GERBERPAUL O'DWYEREUGENE SHAPIROBARBARA TRAUB Letters Of Saudi Arabia , Israel and the F-15 : To the Editor : Saudi Arabia is threatening to cut oil production from eight to five million barrels a day if the U.S. does not provide ** and would regard the refusal to sell the craft as faulting our commitment to her security . At eight million barrels a day she would be producing about three million barrels a day below levels reached in the ' past . Her output has recently been running at about seven million barrels a day , a reduction of some four million barrels a day below the projected poten. tial for this date . The reduction is her " contribution " supporting OPEC oil prices . Capacity elsewhere eliminates the necessity for Saudi Arabia . to produce beyond her financial needs at five million barrels a day . Our devotion to Saudi security is shown in many ways , not the least of which is the very large number of Americans there in military support functions . In proportion , if not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presence in Saudi Arabia far exceeds our relative parallel function for NATO . That presence as well as those in purely civilian activities constitute a substantial deterrent to attack . As a major industrial-commercial power we should not . allow Saudi threats to the dollar to control our political/military decisions . As with blackmail , the " debt " is eternal . Let the value of the dollar rest on financial and industrial realities rather than the prospective whim of third parties . If Saudi Arabia considers that financial practices which support the dollar are in her interest , fine . In any event , let us once and for all reject that link . The dollar weapon needs to be put to rest along with the " threat " to cut oil production . Let 's face up to both of them simultaneously . Then there is the obligation to Saudi Arabia for assisting Egypt . Egyptian moderation within the Middle East . is more than worth the expense to Saudi Arabia . Her assistance to Egypt is probably on the order of $1 billion a year . How much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ substantial payments to the P.L.0. ? Untie the ** production/value of the dollar bundle . Turn down the F-15 's to Saudi Arabia even if she threatens to cut oil production , to reduce the value of the dollar and to fret about our dedication to her security . Finally , if the French desire a role in Saudi Arabia , we should not Laid on a monopoly as an arms supplier .

How to Discriminate Within the Rules To the Editor : The possibility that politicians and members of the board of trustees of the University of Maryland would even consider blocking the appoint . ment of Bertell Oilman as head of the Political Science Department on the College Park campus raises a rich irony . Oilman , a Marxist , was selected after a national search conducted according to the principles of peer re . view . Yet , just last year , in a legal case involving discrimination against a woman faculty member , the University of Maryland at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ review is more important than correcting a discriminatory outcome . In the early 1970 's , Associate Professor of Sociology Margaret Cussler was denied promotion at the College Park campus . When she appealed the decision , the president of the College Park branch appointed a committee of inquiry headed by Mary Berry , now a high-ranking official in the Department of Health , Education and Welfare and then head of the AfroTo the Editor : Your William Safire 's criticism of April 24 of the insensitivity of today 's world to the acknowledged brutality by people and government is - quite justified . The comparison between today 's savagery and the Holocaust is one of degree . But it does seem unfair to suggest that Speaker O'Neill 's failure to condemn the atrocities in Uganda springs from the fact that James Wilmot is a fund raiser for the Speaker and the owner of Page Airways , whose best customer is ' di Amin . I want to defend Speaker O'Neill . He needs no inducement to remain silent about tyranny and oppression . Witness his reluctance to ever mention American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use of peer review Cussler had been the victim of discrimination  --  a finding also affirmed by a committee of the faculty senate . Ignoring both faculty committees , the university refused to promote Cussler . It argued that administrators should not intervene in the peer review process ( as it had been used by the Sociology Department ) and that such intervention would violate academic freedom . The present debate within the Maryland community about the propriety of appointing Bertell Oilman , a Marxist , to a position of responsibility reveals how rules may be invoked in order to discriminate . Oilman may be rejected despite his selection through peer review . Cussler was denied promotion to affirm the processes of peer review . Clearly , the university cares more about its ability to discriminate than about academic freedom .

But then , Mr. Safire could n't find space in his column to include Great Britain and Northern Ireland . So you see , O'Neill is not the only one guilty of silence . Yet I ca n't blame Safire either  --  it is O'Neill 's relatives who are being gored . PAUL O'DWYER New York , April 24 , 1978 To the Editor : Your lead editorial of April 27 endorses conditioning the sale of aircraft to Israel on the sale of ** to Saudi Arabia , but you fail to even allude to the separate obligations of the United States to sell aircraft to Israel pursuant to the September 1975 Memorandum of Agreement between Israel and the United States . In the absence of reciprocal concessions by Egypt , the Ford Administration induced Israel to withdraw from the vital Mitla and Gidi passes , and from the Abu Rodeis oil fields , after American assurances of " every effort to be fully responsive .. on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and other defense requirements . " Specifically included in the " assurances " were the supply of F-16 aircraft and other " advanced and sophisticated weapons . " There is no doubt that without the American assurances Israel Would not have agreed to the withdrawal , which the United States recognized as " an act of great significance on Israel 's part in the pursuit of final peace . " President Carter 's belated amendment of American " assurances " constitutes a unilateral revocation of American commitments . Whatever one 's view of the merits of aircraft sales to Saudi Arabia , to endorse the " package " concept without considering the spirit and letter of our agreement with Israel is a disservice to your readers . ROGER A. GERBER Scarsdale , April 28 , 1978 Spy Progress To the Editor : Another myth has faded into oblivion . No more do we hear of the caps tured spy who disdainfully brushes aside a blindfold and faces a firing squad with head held high . Nowadays , spies are traded like ball players , and some have even become free agents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next  --  a candy bar named after a super-spy ? The Mata Hari chewy crunch ? EUGENE SHAPIRO Long Island City , N.Y. , April 28 , 1978 On the Silence of Speaker O'Neill Holocaust : The Most Significant and Painful Question To the Editor : I am a survivor of Auschwitz and I have watched the NBC presentation of " Holocaust " from beginning to end . Contrary to what some of my American friends feared , it did not rip open any of my old wounds . Those wounds had never healed , as they were , and are , beyond healing . I have made my peace a long time ago , and it is this : I will ache for the rest of my life ; for as long as I live , I can not forget or forgive Auschwitz . I had hoped that once the presentation of " Holocaust " occurred it would become merely the beginning of further and more meaningful explorations of that subject by Jews and non-Jews , by youngsters and adults alike , who have little or no knowledge of those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point out the peril that when man ceases to be his brother 's keeper mankind can become murderous . Instead , one is side-tracked by raging controversies among writers , teachers , critics and public relations people regarding the accuracy of certain details in the series and whether or not the subject of the Holocaust should have been televised in the first place , particularly in the form that was commercially created for it . It seems to me that by spending psychic , emotional and intellectual energy on these issues one avoids facing other issues , more painful and infinitely more relevant to the entire tragedy . I believe that there are two kinds of people : those who had the Auschwitz ( standing for the Holocaust ) experience , and those who did not . Concerning the Holocaust , each of these groups brings to it its own interpretation , resulting from a completely different set of values . Those who were not in Auschwitz are simply not equipped to understand the value system of those who were there . It is as if each group were speaking a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purity for which some survivors clamor  --  with justification ? in the portrayal of events of the uolocaust is simply not a part of the area of comprehension of those who did not have the Auschwitz experience . Should the lack of such an ingredient then close off attempts to convey the lesson , the story , the impact of the Holocaust in any manner other than we , the survivors , wish it to be done ? ? I believe not ! The controversy on the issues described above has moved a plethora of well-known individuals in literature , media , religion and education to address themselves mainly to those narrow grounds , thus deflecting fundamental questions which , I believe , the airing of " Holocaust " must raise : What did leaders of Western democracies as well as God 's earthly representative , the Pope , do to save European Jewry during the Nazi plague ? The Times welcomes letters from readers . Letters for publication must include the writer 's name , address and telephone number . Because of the large volume of mail received , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unpublished letters . If the Jews had escaped Himmler , Eichmann et al. , where could they have gone ? Which country was ready to offer asylum to the hunted , persecuted Jews ? The answers are a shameful and devastating nothing , nowhere , and none . The viewing of " Holocaust , " its many errors notwithstanding , should at last bring the viewer to focus on the vital , the primary issue : Where was he when it happened ? What did he or his family do about it ? and What did his government do ? The unseeable has been seen , albeit inadequately , by over 100 million people . If we wish our generation and future generations to grasp fully the dramatic dimensions of the Holocaust , it is imperative that we now address ourselves to the most significant and painful question : Why were six million Jews annihilated  --  and not how ? The history of victims and victimizers must not be used to hide the guilt of the bystander and the crime of passivity on the part of the nations of the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
