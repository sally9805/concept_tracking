txt If you 're thinking of fleeing to a small town or farm to escape inflation , think again . People who live there say the cosi of living is hitting them as hard as it is bitting Chicago and suburban residents . This is the first in a series about inflationary conditions discovered during a tour by the Chicago Tribune 's Action Express bus . By William Sluis and Anne Keegan Chicago Tritune Press Service RANIUN , Ill. , April ** it were somehow possible to work 12 days a week . Glen Ketchum , police chief of this village 35 miles north of Danville in Vermilion County , would be able to make as much as a patrolman in Chicago . As it is , he works a six-day week , driving his own squad car , to earn $7,000 a year ? only half of what he would make if he worked as a Windy City patrolman . Ketchum , 39 , sees his low pay as part of the squeeze in which residents of small towns are finding themselves : I o'w salaries , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it harder and harder to keep up with the soaring cost of living . " My wife , Mary , travels a total of 70 miles a day into Danville and back to work for a place that sells tires , " Ketchum said . " If she did n't work , it would be a very rough go . I suppose I 'd go back to jockeying cars . " KETCHUM was a part-time used car salesman , " jockeying cars , " until several months ago , when he quit because of , the demands of his police job . Not only does he provide his own squad car , a ' 69 Ford , but he also does his own tune-ups . He gets no car allowance , ex-too cept for rare out-of-town trips for police ' business . " Costs of everything are really hitting us , " he said . " Food is way up ( the weekly food bill for the family , which includes . three children , is $603 . But so are tires , car parts , and taxes . You name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said a family in Rankin , a village of 760 , could live " decently " four years ago on an income of $10,000 . Today , a family bringing in $14,000 , as his does , is barely getting by , he said . " We are n't getting ahead one bit , " he said . Dozens of other small town residents who talked to reporters who made a 10-day , 1,500-mile trip aboard the Action Express mobile city desk told roughly the same story : A small town is no longer a place to try to hide from spiraling inflation . ALTHO reporters continued to hear praise for small town values and the quiet , crimefree way of life in smaller codununities , they found residents of the Midwest heartland generally disgruntled about inflation . They also found small town folks compensating for the high Cost of living in numerous ways . Among them : ? Commuting long distances into larger cities to find higher-paying jobs . ? Severing their historic ties with farming to take nearby jobs that pay wages . ? Cutting down on entertainment . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place of meat , especially steak . ? Cultiva'ing do-it-Yourself skills , including doing their own auto repairs . sewing , and baking . ? Making do with old things , notably cars , instead of buying new . ? Obtaining food stamps , or welfare assistance , when financial troubles become insurmountable . " I 'M LIVING pretty conservatively . A lot of people would think they could n't live at all on twice what I 'm getting by on . " said Walter Thode , 59 , of Villa Grove , Douglas County . He was forced to quit work as a construction supervisor nearly a year ago , because of illness , ? and is living off savings while he seeks a new job . Thode said he is eating less and is buying cheaper food . i 've got military medals 32:0 e fro  --  i the war World War III but I ca n't eat those , " he said . ? ? ! ' ve cut every expense I could , because I 've got to make a monthly house payment . " Raymond Moorman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mt . Sterling , Brown County , said business is good because people are keeping their cars longer in the knowledge that auto repairs are rela ! ively cheap . " My price for labor has gone from 53 to $4.50 an hour in the last few years , but that 's a lot less than the S13 an hour some garages are c a rgi iv : in Chicago , " he said . People complain anyway , Moorman said , but the auto repair business is good . Altho the price of parts has been going up rapidly , he said , Brown County residents are more likely to seek an engine nye . hael no : than they were a few years ago . . The price : $30J to EVERYWHERE reporters traveled , Midwest farmers , who generally have been pictured as villains who are causing inflation , described themselves as its victims . Sam Brickey , 41 , who farms 208 acres near Murrayville in Morgan County 30 miles west of Springfield , said prices of some used equipment have gone up by nearly hal ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a farm auction near Eldred , Greene County , along the Illinois River . Brickey was seeking a used hay rake , which he said w. ; old have cost approximately 5425 a year ago . When the ' eliding was all thru , Brickey stood empty-handed as another farmer bid the price up to $625 . " These guys figure the price of food is going to go up and up , " Brickey said when the auction ended . " Personally , I do n't know . A little inflation is a good thing , but it could go too fast . I 'd hate to see it turn around . " IN CUBA . Fulton County , Clyde Mason , 46 , turned his back on a 264-acre farm three years ago , sold all his equipment and took a job driving a truck for the Illinois Division of Highways . He said that farmers were getting too little money then and that they are getting too little now . " I was just barely getting by , breaking even . I did n't have anything left over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know how much money to expect each payday . I know how much I can afford to spend for something to eat . " Not all downstate residents believe inflation is out of control . Some say that , unlike city dwellers , they are able to cut costs by fishing and living off the land . LEO SAVAGE . 63. a resident of Glasgow , Scott County , said he gave up driving 120 miles a day to a job at a chemical factory in East Alton to take up a life of hunting and fishing . " I get a lot of carp , catfish , and hurrto ffis'il out of the ttlinnis ' liver , " he said . " I also hunt quite a few deer and sma ler - arne . Ri-sh ' about now , I 'm getting ready to go mushroom hunting . " On the whole , Savage said , people in small towns are still able to avoid at least some of inflation 's effects . " Down here , we do n't buy as many things as we would in Chicago , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have benefited by irflati:n . One is William Hallar , 41 , a construction foreman who lays cement blocks for a company based in Lewistown , Fulton County . " I 'm making 57.50 an hour , " he said . " Inflation has n't hurt me any . I 'm even saving soractbing . But I work hard . When you grab a 65-pound block and cl'mb three scaffolds high , you know you 've dore some work .
