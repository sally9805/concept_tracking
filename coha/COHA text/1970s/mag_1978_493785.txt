The Novelists Gunter Grass Now 50 years old ( - but younger than I was at a0 , " he teases ) , Gunter Grass sits down for the interview at his ease , expansive , ready to laugh . We speak in English , which slightly inhibits his famous exuberant turn of phrase . At perhaps 5 " 9 ' , Grass is dressed in an open-collared sports shirt and unbuttoned jacket . His skin is tobacco-colored and the heavy lids of his dark Tartar eyes sag to one side like a tangled venetian blind . We begin discussing his work habits . Gwen Kinkead : Do yes still sortie standing betore a high desk ? Gunter Grass : Yes , you see I started as a sculptor and always worked standing . I pace too , speaking each sentence aloud . Once I figured out that when I write five hours daily , I walkabout 10 kilometers . I write in Berlin and in my country house near north Hamburg . One week a month I live in Berlin , which is a very important place for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the country . Hon didThe Flounder mire ? For a resteso of Thr Flounder , see page 321 Were the fish and the women 's tribunal later additions ? My first idea was to write about the evolution of food . From there the wome n rooks came immediately . Then I saw the problem between men and womn . That led me to the fairy tale . The first manuscript . which took a year , contains all this But the proportions changed in the second and third drafts . Some of the many little chapters grew together . Id begun with some poetry , some etchings and some prose . The book grew from all sides , very differently from other books which I wrote chronologically . In The Diary of a Snail I mention I 'd like next to write about food . I was so involved in politics at the time and was tired out by its second-hand language . I needed to write an epic , to try out everything and work with firsthand language , from dialect up to High German , Baroque and Romantic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between nine centuries . Could you realism sohat the flounder symbolizes ? I do n't like the word symbolize . The fish speaks sometimes like God , sometimes in a philosophical way like the Hegel invention of the spirit of history . He is also the devil . He 's everything ? what people like to think he is Symbols are static . We always say ' reality ' is what we see , but I think that is fantasy . Our dreams are our realities . We have a curtain suspended between ' real ' things and our dreams and wishes . I have pulled away this curtain and mixed them up . You never really know what kind of reality it is The German lemtnrst magazine Emma elected you ' Pasha of Ihr Month- after Der Butte ' s publication . yet the book praises future lash , re unit be shaped by How wn . Ho could this be ? ome I 'm not a pasha at all Der Butte is my devotion to all women . Not in the way Emma wants . I 'm against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like men , to come to power and use power like men . Women can drive tractors , sure , why not ? That is n't the question . We need change . I 'm not sure a history shaped by women will be better ; we have had few precedents . Our philosophy , for instance , is written by men , from Socrates up . When these feminists get power , they 'll use it like men . We have had enough stupid men And now we have stupid women using power the way stupid men have for centuries Why then do your women characters never yet out of the kitchen ? Many feminists are upper or middle class women who do n't consider housewives and their problems , but instead blamewomen for being housewives . That 's criminal Many housewives like it : it 's amarvelous profession , for men too . I do it . It 's far more interesting than to sit as a clerk in an office eight hours a day . How does Der Butte depart f rain your other novels in Ire hem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use of time , and its utopian character . It 's a utopian novel in the way I look toward the future and back at the past . Utopian thinking comes not only from our present and future . we also have material for our utopias in the past . Heaven is a utopia . Paradise also . In all our social schemes and understandings we 're always trying to regain the lost paradise . ! could never have written The Flounder before The Tin Drum . Growing up in Nazi Germany , I had first to write about that experience to make myself clear about it . Germans regarded Nazis as demons who suddenly appeared , springing up from the earth . They 'd talk in metaphors about ' our darkness in Germany . ' But everything happened in daylight ! I tried to put away the mystical notions about fascism and Nazism , to show how our great middle class was prepared to be the basis of fascism . I 've got the freedom now . having written The Tin Drum . Cat and Mouse and Dog Years to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ period in modern history . Why did I autism sweep Germany ? You forget fascism began in Italy under Mussolini in 1920 when he was a radical socialist . Then Mussolini turned fascist like terrorists today . The BaderMeinhof group , like Mussolini , began in the left wing , but they 're too impatient to wait for change , to work for little changes . They cry out - revolution ! " but the masses do n't follow . Then they say the masses are stupid . They call themselves an elite , the vanguard of revolution , and propose to take the first steps . This is the beginning of fascism One man 's life means nothing to them . They kill and think nothing of it . But many terrorists today spring from the middle class , You have this been too . I 'm sure the danger of left-wing fascism is greater in the United States than in Germany . Before World War II , Germany 's and Italy 's left-wing parties did n't take care of the middle class . They addressed only the proletariat . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ middle class . They gave them something like food and love in nationalism and racism . All in a time of economic crisis and inflation In the US , you 've had prolonged economic crisis If you do n't take care of your middle class , they 'll run to the right . We 're very careful of economic crisis , because we 've learned what can happen . But we also have what you do n't ? a good working social system which protects old people and the unemployed . Do you worry about the effect terrorists haw had on the German middle class ? People speak of hanging the terrorists It 's a hysterical overreaction about security . People are so afraid of this small terrorist group that they do their job for them . Liberal rights were curtailed , young people 's activities watched Now we 're drifting in the opposite direction as we see this only creates a new bureaucracy . One terrible result of the hysteria is that young people have been pushed to opportunism . We 've overreacted partly because in one century we lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twice people lost all their money . You nitro warned against the young ' , generation 's sense of f utdity at out social change . Do you see the same tont usWn here ? Sure , it 's everywhere . Europeans can find no new alternatives in the present . so they look to our cultural past , take a new interest in books and music . That 's harder to do in America because your history is short and some of it is covered in romantic stories and lies . You 're told that the Civil War was n't a horrible war but anevent that created a nation . That 's a lie . The American ideology always to be happy and solve every problem . .. your country must be afraid to live with sadness about loss , about terrible things done in the name of the US . Why is no one discussing Vietnam anymore ? The danger is you will lose this war a second time ? once militarily , then psychologically . After a lost war , you have a chance to win it again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sad about it , to be pushed by it . and not to hide it after a short while . Germany after World War II wanted to forget to . But whenever the wound tried to close , the writers opened it ? too early to forget , we said . From Henrich BOB who is to years older then me , up to Handke , we spoke out . After the first World War in America , this also occurred and is one reason you had great writers then , like Faulkner , Hemingway , Thomas Wolfe and Dos Passos . Today you have some in- teresting , intelligent authors but you 've more a party literature . You 've in- teresting books but no literature . For this you need not to forget , to face the past . Americans I 've met on this visit seem only kind and moderated . no one speaks out . What is Mr chief problem Germany faces today ? The third world , which is n't Germany 's problem alone . We 've never had so many possibilities in nutrition , yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to feed everyone we have to change our economic systems and open our markets to the third world . Now we buy their raw materials for little money , convert them to televisions or refrigerators , and sell them back very expensively . We are able to build televisions that last 40 years , but we do n't because our production systems are geared to waste . Meanwhile our resources run out . Watan3new political systems require capitalism 's dear-cation ? Also of socialism . Both believe in ever-larger growth . They 're twin brothers , born out of the Enlightenment . They were both ideas of progress but now we need to reform them . Is detente possible or likely ? It 's necessary , but I 'm skeptical about it and I think for some things it is already too late . We can only have detente if we change our economic systems and are willing to put 500,000 Western people out of work when weapon production is stopped Too late . do you mean . for Altman rights ? It 's very easy for us in the West @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd like the Jews in Russia to be able to do what they want , but the problem of Indonesians or Indians is to feed their family . This is also a human right . Will you mmpaign for Chancellor Schmidt in the net election as you did ( or Brandt in 1909 ? That depends . If Franx Josef Strauss , leader of the Christian Social Union , opens his party all over Germany , this will be very dangerous . Then I will campaign again . Strauss is really dangerous . He 's in love with power He did n't learn from history . I 'd never say he 's a fascist . But for him democracy is only formal . He wants it but also a strong stale . As cal. , Gram or writer Tract do you feel a duty to ' guard and bar the path bark to Hell . ' as lobs Updike once wrote of you ? To prevent a relapse into fascism ? Yes . I do n't want us to make the same mistake twice We learnt our lesson Also , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afraid to go to the dentist , and I do n't like systems where they try to prove how much pain an author can stand . To defend myself too , then , I speak out . You have said that ' writing had become rather ore dtltimIC once you 'd finished The Tin Drum and beta . famous . Is that our now ? Fame is only boring . I forget about it . I 'm very glad to be successful ; ! do n't create a problem out of it But for children perhaps it 's quite difficult to live with a famous father . And for my first wife too . Ever since I was 10 . I wanted to become an artist . In this sense , I 'm very egocentric . I have to do this It comes first in my life . People who live with we have to accept this . Fame , then , did n't complicate writing ? Yes , people expect more In an essay you said you wroteThe Tin Drum of because of any creative certainly or higher mission , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you writing today ? When I began The Tin Drum , I thought I 'd show the petit-bourgeois , my own background , what they did . Perhaps it was somewhat proud and childish to think I knew something about them that they did n't . It 's different now : I write now to express myself about things that disturb me. that make me anxious about myself and human beings altogether , future questions , stupid lies we are hying from the past . For me being creative is as necessary as going to the toiler You know , after Dog Years , I got into a panic I thought , ' you have n't lived life . You work like an instrument ' I tried to live , but it was catastrophic . After six months , I went back to my work , and it WAS much better Do yin . agree with mins that you err a comic author , The best expression in my view of the comic spirit is to write from despair . My own background is despair . Most people run to an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an analyst . They take away your sorrow and charge you for that People say I have a mother complex . Its true . I have a marvelous mother complex . I allow no one to take it away . My headstone will read , ' Here lies Ciinter Grass and his mother complex .
