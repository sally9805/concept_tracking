When such weighty concerns as inept trial lawyers are not on his mind , Chief Justice Burger can get his pique up about remarkably picayune matters . Lately he and some fellow Justices have been smoldering about the attire of attorneys appearing before the Supreme Court . <P> Burger was particularly upset by an incident in October . A woman lawyer about to argue a case told Court Clerk Michael Kodak , " All I own are pantsuits . Should I go out and buy a dress ? " Rodak checked with Burger and reported back that the Chief had said " no to pantsuits in no uncertain terms . " Apparently unimpressed , the woman appeared in a pantsuit . <P> Three weeks ago a male attorney showed up in an outfit for which , one Justice allowed , " unharmonious would be a kind term . " The attorney 's chief sartorial sin : wearing a patterned brown shirt and a clashing patterned red tie . The departure from white-shirted tradition prompted whispered comments while the unfortunate fellow argued his case . Muttered one Justice : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <P> The old , old fashion was , of course , morning suits for all . Once , in the 1890s , when a young attorney showed up in " street clothes , " Justice Horace Gray was overheard growling , " Who is that beast who dares to come in here with a gray coat ? " In recent years , a dark business suit has become acceptable , though the Solicitor General and his male staff members still represent the U.S. in cutaways and striped trousers . As for Deputy Solicitor General Jewel Lafontant , she has designed a cutaway-inspired jacket and striped skirt . <P> But as more and more women follow in the footsteps of Shakespeare 's Portia , inquiries like the one on the pantsuit seem more likely . For instance , Watergate Prosecutor Jill Volner has been an eyecatcher as she cross-examines at Judge John Sirica 's court in boots and a mini . Would the same attire pass muster before the " nine old men " ? <P> Firmly against too many liberties where dress is concerned , Burger has ordered Clerk Rodak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Rodak reports : " It will say that male lawyers should wear a dark suit , with a vest if possible , a conservative tie and black shoes . " Women will be discouraged from wearing sweaters or pants . " The dress , " says one Justice , " should be appropriate to a serious undertaking such as a court proceeding . "
