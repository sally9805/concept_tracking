SCENE : Upstage center , a small Christmas tree on a small table with tiny blinking lights . Downstage center left , a plain board table with four wooden chairs , one each on the four sides . The table is set very simply for four people . Just plates , forks and knives . Four coffee cups and a pot of hot coffee in the middle . Running across the middle of the stage above is a clothesline attached to a pulley at either side of the stage . The light onstage is divided exactly in half , so that upstage is in complete darkness except for the blinking lights of the Christmas tree . Downstage is lit in pale yellow and white light which pulses brighter and dimmer every ten minutes or so , as though the power were very weak . The characters are all in their late twenties to early thirties . SHOOTER and JEEP , the two men , are dressed in long dark overcoats , jeans , lumberjack shirts , and heavy boots . They both have their heads shaved . LUPE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ style . She wears platform heels . LIZA wears a long , full , Mexican type skirt , plain blouse and an apron . She wears sandals . LUPE sits upstage of the table facing LIZA across from her . LIZA 'S back is directly to the audience . JEEP sits stage right at one end of the table across from SHOOTER , who sits at the other end . The stage is in darkness for a while with just the tree blinking . The lights come up very slowly downstage . Nothing happens for a while except the slight movements of the actors drinking coffee . JEEP rocks slightly in his chair . All the exits and entrances occur upstage into or out of the darkness . JEEP ( leaning back in his chair and rocking gently ) I 'm looking forward to my life . I 'm looking forward to uh  --  me . The way I picture me. p. 3 SHOOTER Who 're you talking to ? JEEP Uh  --  ( pause ) I had this room I lived in . Shall I describe this room ? ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) I had a wall with a picture of Walt Whitman in an overcoat . Every time I looked at the picture I thought of Pennsylvania . I had a picture of an antelope on a yellow prairie . Every time I looked at this picture I saw him running . I had a picture of the Golden Gate Bridge . Every time I looked at it I saw the water underneath it . I had a picture of me sitting on a Jeep with a gun in one hand . ( He lets the chair come to rest on the floor again . Pause as they all sip coffee . Suddenly LIZA jumps up and makes a big gesture with her hands melodramatically . ) LIZA Oh my God ! The turkey ! ( She goes running off upstage and disappears into the darkness . ) LUPE ( to herself ) It 's funny the way the snow is . SHOOTER ( pulling a book out from his lap and placing it on the table ) Maybe we should read . LUPE We 'll have to wait for Liza . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place . Do you remember where it was ? p. 4 LUPE I thought we marked it . SHOOTER I lost the place . LUPE ( taking the book and thumbing through it ) Here , let me look . JEEP Shooter , can you do a soft shoe ? SHOOTER Naw . I do n't think so . JEEP I was wondering if we could both do it sitting down . Without getting up . Just our legs . SHOOTER Just like this you mean ? JEEP Yeah . LUPE Was it chapter sixteen ? SHOOTER Uh  --  Maybe . ( LUPE continues thumbing ) JEEP Just try . Put your hands on the table . ( They both put their hands on the table . ) JEEP One , two , three , quatro ! ( They both break into an attempt at a soft shoe patter as they stare blankly at each other in their seats . LUPE keeps looking through the book . This lasts for about thirty seconds and ends with LIZA coming back into the light sucking on her fingers and wiping her hands on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) p. 5 LIZA ( noticing LUPE with the book ) Oh . Are we gon na ' read ? LUPE I ca n't find the place . LIZA Let me take a look . ( LUPE shoves the book across the table to LIZA , who takes it and starts thumbing through it . She keeps sucking on her fingers in between turning the pages . ) LUPE Shooter lost the place . JEEP Uh  --  I saw this picture of a dancing bear . Some gypsies had it on a leash . They were all laying by the side of the road and the bear was standing on all fours . Right in the middle of the road . In the background was this fancy house . ( SHOOTER pulls his overcoat over his head and holds his hands up in front of him like bear paws . Slowly he pushes his chair back and rises . He takes short staggering steps like a bear on his hind legs . LIZA keeps looking through the book . ) JEEP ( to SHOOTER ) Do n't act it out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book ) Were we past the part where the comet exploded ? JEEP ( to SHOOTER ) You do n't have to act it out . ( SHOOTER pays no attention. ) p. 6 LUPE I never saw a dancing bear . That was before my time . I guess they made it illegal . Too cruel or something . ( SHOOTER goes back and forth downstage like a trained bear , looking out at the audience . ) SHOOTER It does n't feel cruel . Just humiliating . It 's not the rightful position of a bear . You can feel it . It 's all off balance . LUPE Well , that 's what I mean . JEEP What ? LUPE That 's cruel . For a bear that 's cruel . SHOOTER No . It 's as though something 's expected of me . As though I was human . But it puts me in a different position . A different situation . JEEP How ? SHOOTER Performing . Um  --  Without realizing it . Um  --  I mean I realize it but the bear does n't . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Awkward . JEEP You 're not the bear . LIZA I found it ! They 've returned to earth only to find that things are exactly the same . Nothing 's changed . JEEP That 's not it . Let me try . ( JEEP takes the book from LIZA and goes through it . SHOOTER drops his bear routine and pulls his overcoat down on his shoulders . He looks blankly at the audience , then strolls back to his seat and sits . They all sip their coffee . After a long pause. ) p. 7 SHOOTER I think I 'll take a bath . LIZA The turkey 's almost ready . SHOOTER I 'm too scared to eat . ( not showing it ) LUPE ( to LIZA ) Let him take a bath . It 'll calm him down . SHOOTER Is there any hot water left ? JEEP ( thumbing through the book ) There was the last time I was up there . SHOOTER I do n't want to go up there alone . LUPE If you could remember the last time when you got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know . It 's the same . It 's the snow . Being inside . Everything 's so shocking inside . When I look at my hand I get terrified . The sight of my feet in the bathtub . The skin covering me . That 's all that 's covering me . LIZA ( pulling out a hip flask from her apron ) You want some rum ? ( SHOOTER takes the flask and has a drink . ) LUPE I can remember the last time I got scared . I thought I 'd poisoned myself . I thought I 'd eaten something . I imagined it working its way into me . I went outside in my bare feet and forced myself to throw up . It was that kind of a night . p. 8 LIZA I remember that night . We were watching the stars . ( The two girls start laughing , covering their mouths , then stop . ) SHOOTER I know I 'll get over this . It just sorta ' came on me . ( He hands the flask back to LIZA , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without giving it back ) You can keep it . SHOOTER ( blankly ) I 've got this feeling that females are more generous . I 've always felt that . JEEP ( pushing the book away from him ) OH THIS IS RIDICULOUS ! ! I CA N'T FIND THE PLACE ! ! ( He stands suddenly , picks up his chair and smashes it to the floor . The chair shatters into tiny pieces . Pause . None of the others are shocked . ) LIZA ( standing ) I think there 's another one out on the back porch . ( LIZA leaves . She disappears in the darkness upstage . JEEP pulls his overcoat up over his head and raises his hands like SHOOTER did . He goes through the same bear motions as SHOOTER did before . LUPE takes the book again and looks through the pages. ) p. 9 SHOOTER ( to himself ) That 's what I do . I get this feeling I ca n't control the situation . Something 's getting out of control . Things wo n't work . And then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Later I find out that my throat is short . My heart 's thumping . I do n't recognize myself . LUPE Shooter , were n't you the last one to read ? SHOOTER Was I ? LUPE Yeah . It was you . SHOOTER It does n't matter does it ? LUPE Only if you can remember where you left off . SHOOTER Well , let me look . I 'll see if I can find it . ( He takes the book and looks through it . LUPE starts into a soft shoe sitting down . JEEP has his back to her , but as he hears her feet tapping he stops his bear routine and turns to look at her . She continues with a smile . JEEP pulls his overcoat down on his shoulders and just stares at her . ) JEEP ( flatly ) There 's something to be said for not being able to do something well . ( LUPE stops . Her smile disappears. ) p. 10 JEEP No , I mean it 's all right . It takes a certain amount of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . LUPE It 's no worse than the one you guys did . JEEP No , I know . I 'm not trying to insult you or anything . ( LUPE starts up the soft shoe again in defiance . ) JEEP I mean we 've got this picture in our head of Judy Garland or Gene Kelly or Fred Astaire . Those feet flying all over the place . That fluid motion . How can we do anything for the first time . Even Nijinksy went nuts . LUPE ( continuing with her feet ) What about it ? JEEP It 's hard to have a conversation . ( He sits down on the floor . LUPE continues dancing for a while after JEEP 'S seated . She slowly stops . SHOOTER thumbs through the book . They sip their coffee . ) LUPE ( to JEEP ) When you 're in a position of doing something like that it 's hard to talk about it . You know what I mean ? I mean while I was doing it  --  while I was in the middle of actually doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . I mean it made me feel funny . You know what I mean . It was like somebody was watching me . Judging me . Sort of making an evaluation . Chalking up points . I mean especially the references to all those stars . You know . I mean I know I 'm not as good as Judy Garland . But so what ? I was n't trying to be as good as Judy Garland . It started off like it was just for fun you know . And then it turned into murder . It was like being murdered . You know what I mean . p. 11 JEEP Did n't mean to piss you off . ( Paus . LIZA enters from upstage with a new chair in one hand and a broom and dustpan in the other . She sets the chair down . JEEP gets up off the floor and sits in the new chair , folding his arms across his chest . LIZA starts sweeping up the pieces of the old chair . JEEP watches her . ) JEEP ( to LIZA ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because you 're already doing it . ( LIZA continues sweeping in silence . ) SHOOTER ( looking up from the book , directed at everyone ) I know that feeling of being out of control . Powerless . You go crazy . In a second you can go crazy . You can almost see it coming . A thunderstorm . JEEP ( to SHOOTER ) It 's not that . SHOOTER Oh . ( SHOOTER goes back to thumbing through the book . ) JEEP I mean sometimes it 's like that but this time it was n't . LIZA ( still sweeping ) Did you find the place yet ? SHOOTER Nope . LUPE I 'm starving . ( she licks her lips ) p. 12 JEEP This time it came from something else . I had an idea I wanted to be different . I pictured myself being different than how I was . I could n't stand how I was . The picture grew in me , and the more it grew the more it came up against how I really was . Then I exploded . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's what I meant . LUPE Oh , when are we gon na ' EAT ! ( hitting the table once with her fist ) LIZA It 's almost ready . ( LIZA exits upstage with the pieces of the old chair , leaving the broom onstage . ) JEEP I could n't take it . Just thumbing through the book . Not even looking . Not even seeing the papers . Just turning them . Acting it out . Just pretending . ( Suddenly LUPE starts gnawing ravenously on her own arm . JEEP and SHOOTER pay no attention . ) SHOOTER ( still looking through the book ) I know . JEEP Is that what you 're doing ? Is that what you 're doing right now ? SHOOTER ( without looking up ) I 'm looking for the place . p. 13 JEEP I admire your concentration . I could n't concentrate . I kept thinking of other things . I kept drifting . I kept thinking of the sun . The Gulf of Mexico . Barracuda . SHOOTER ( still into the book ) That 's okay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IT 'S OKAY ! ! THAT 'S NOT WHAT I 'M SAYING ! ( He picks up the new chair and smashes it to the ground just like the other one . LUPE stops chewing on her arm and licks it like a cat licking a wound . SHOOTER keeps looking for the place in the book . JEEP stands there looking at the damage . ) SHOOTER ( after a short pause , referring to book ) Was it just after the fall of the Great Continent ? LUPE Oh my stomach ! ( She clutches her stomach with both hands and holds it like a baby . LIZA enters with a huge golden turkey on a silver platter with the steam rising off it . She sets it down on the table in front of LUPE . ) LUPE I 'll carve . ( LUPE picks up a knife and begins to slice the turkey in a calm way , very formally , and laying the slices on plates for everyone . LIZA walks over to JEEP , who is still looking at the broken chair . They look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ event outside themselves. ) p. 14 LIZA ( to JEEP but looking at the broken chair ) You 'll have to stop doing that . We 've only got one left . ( LIZA picks up the broom . JEEP grabs it . They both hold it together . ) JEEP I 'll do it . LIZA That 's okay . ( A short pause as they look at each other , then JEEP yanks the broom out of LIZA 'S hand and starts sweeping up the broken chair . LIZA goes to the table and sits folding her hands in her lap while LUPE continues to carve standing up . SHOOTER sticks with the book . ) LUPE We 're lucky to have a turkey you know . LIZA Yes , I know . LUPE It was smart thinking to raise our own . To see ahead into the crisis . LIZA Whose idea was it anyway ? SHOOTER ( not looking up ) Mine . JEEP ( still sweeping ) I think it was mine . SHOOTER ( not looking up ) It was your idea , and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . p. 15 LIZA That 's right . LUPE We 're sure lucky . LIZA Do you know what they say is the best way to prepare a turkey ? They say that before you kill it  --  about two weeks before  --  you start feeding it a little cornmeal and some sherry . About a teaspoonful of sherry , three times a day . Then in the second week you force a whole walnut down its throat once a day and keep up the sherry dosage . When it comes time for the kill you 'll have a turkey with a warm , nutty flavor . LUPE Is that what you did ? LIZA Partly . I started out the first week with the sherry , but by the time the second week rolled around I could n't bring myself to do it . I mean the walnut thing . I could n't do that . JEEP ( as he exits upstage with the broken pieces of the chair ) It 's not cruel . LUPE Who killed it anyway ? LIZA I did . SHOOTER I ca n't find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it on the floor , opens his napkin and tucks it into his shirt , picks up his knife and fork and waits to be served . ) SHOOTER Are n't we going to have any vegetables ? p. 16 LIZA No . We had a late frost remember ? LUPE We 're lucky to have a turkey . SHOOTER I know we are . I was just wondering about the vegetables . The creamed onions and stuff . The candied yams . LUPE ( to SHOOTER ) Dark or light ? SHOOTER White . ( She hands SHOOTER a plate of turkey . He digs in . ) LIZA No wine either , I suppose ? LUPE You were in the kitchen . ( She hands LIZA a plate of turkey . LIZA eats . LUPE serves herself and sits down to eat . ) LIZA Yes . I 've never cooked over an open fire before . I mean a big fire blazing like that . It 's hard to keep from cooking yourself . Your arms start roasting . You get afraid the kitchen 's going to burn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is tremendous . SHOOTER I thought turkeys were supposed to cook slow . LIZA Well , you let the flames die down . It 's just the embers you 're cooking on . But the heat ! p. 17 SHOOTER Yeah , it 's hot in here for a change . ( JEEP enters from upstage into the light , shivering and rubbing his arms . LIZA stops him . ) LIZA Oh Jeep , could you get us all some water ? JEEP ( standing still , shivering ) Right now ? LIZA Yeah , if you do n't mind . JEEP From the well ? It 's a lot of work you know . We ca n't just turn on a tap . LUPE We 're lucky to have a turkey . ( JEEP turns upstage and exits . ) SHOOTER It is freezing out there . I do n't envy him . Hauling up water . Spilling it on his hands . It 's freezing . LIZA It 's all right . SHOOTER In the dark . Feeling your way around . He might fall in . LIZA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Shooter . SHOOTER ( standing suddenly ) I KNOW IT 'S ALL RIGHT ! ( The two women continue eating , paying no attention . SHOOTER sits down after a while. ) p. 18 SHOOTER ( quietly to himself ; LUPE and LIZA eat quietly ) Just because we 're surrounded by four walls and a roof does n't mean anything . It 's still dangerous . The chances of something happening are just as great . Anything could happen . Any move is possible . I 've seen it . You go outside . The world 's quiet . White . Everything resounding . Not a sound of a motor . Not a light . You see into the house . You see the candles . You watch the people . You can see what it 's like inside . The candles draw you . You get a cold feeling being outside . Separated . You have an idea that being inside it 's cosier . Friendlier . Warmth . People . Conversation . Everyone using a language . Then you go inside . It 's a shock . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what you had outside . You forget that there even is an outside . The inside is all you know . You hunt for a way of being with everyone . A way of finding how to behave . You find out what 's expected of you . You act yourself out . ( JEEP enters from upstage with a bucketful of water and four cups in the other hand . Each cup dangling from one of his fingers by the handle . He sets the bucket down on the table with the cups . He picks up a cup and dips it into the bucket . He does the same with each cup and serves everyone at the table with a cup of water . Then he sits down on the floor . This all happens in silence , except for the sounds of the others eating and the water. ) p. 19 LIZA ( standing ) There 's one chair left . SHOOTER ( standing and moving upstage ) I 'll get it . ( SHOOTER exits . LIZA sits again . ) LUPE Dark or light , Jeep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of turkey . JEEP eats , sitting on the floor . ) JEEP I was thinking . If things get worse we should get a cow . LIZA Nobody 's selling . JEEP You 've asked around ? LIZA Nobody 's selling . LUPE I was thinking chickens would be better . LIZA Nobody 's selling . JEEP That 's all right . LUPE A goat might be good . LIZA There 's no way of actually preparing . We 'll have to do the best with what we 've got . We 're all eating now . At least we 're eating . We 'll have to gauge our hunger . Find out if we actually need food when we think we need it . Find out how much it takes to stay alive . Find out what it does to us . Find out what 's happening to us . Sometimes I think I know , but it 's only an idea . Sometimes I have the idea I know what 's happening to us . Sometimes I ca n't see it . I go blind . Other times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eating . ( SHOOTER comes back on from upstage empty-handed . They all stop eating and look at him. ) p. 20 SHOOTER I forgot what it was I went for . I got out there and forgot . JEEP ( still on the floor ) The chair . SHOOTER Oh yeah . ( SHOOTER turns upstage and exits again . They go back to eating . ) JEEP ( to himself ) It does n't really matter . I 'm okay on the floor . LIZA I made a move to go get it , and then he beat me to it . JEEP It does n't matter . LUPE Was he being polite ? LIZA I guess . LUPE ( to LIZA ) Just to keep you from going out there ? LIZA I guess so . LUPE But he 's getting the chair for Jeep , and Jeep does n't even care . LIZA It 's all right . JEEP ( suddenly , to himself ) Walt Whitman was a great man . He kissed soldiers . He held their hands . He saw mounds of amputated limbs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( SHOOTER comes on from upstage pulling a very heavy , stuffed red armchair . He huffs and puffs with it , pulling it by inches downstage as the others stay sitting and eat their turkey. ) p. 21 JEEP He expected something from America . He had this great expectation . LUPE I do n't know . I never heard about it . JEEP He was like what Tolstoy was to Russia . LIZA I do n't know much about it either . JEEP A father . A passionate father bleeding for his country . LIZA ( staying seated ) Do you want some help , Shooter ? SHOOTER ( between heavy breaths ) No  --  I 'm uh  --  okay . It 's  --  not much  --  further . I 'll be all right . JEEP Almost a hundred years ago to the day . The same thing happened . Everybody at each other 's throats . Walt was there . He could tell you . LIZA I thought he was dead . JEEP ( conversationally ) " Manahatta , " it was called then . Indian . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the floor . German beer . Juggling acts . Dancing bears . The Civil War was just beginning . LUPE When was this ? JEEP He 'd tip his hat to Abe , and Abe would tip his hat back . p. 22 LIZA They liked each other . JEEP ( in a Walter Cronkite newscaster voice ) The poet and the President . The poet all gray and white standing on his feet . The President all dark and somber , glooming down from his horse . The face of war in his eyes . The two of them seeing each other from their respective positions . The entire nation in a jackknife . This all happened on Vermont Avenue near L Street . The street itself was raining . Blue soldiers were lying wounded in every doorway ; some having slept there all night with gaping wounds . Soaked through to the bone . Walt was a witness to it . ( SHOOTER finally gets the chair downstage right and stands by it trying to catch his breath . He looks at JEEP , who stays seated on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his hand . He tries to speak , but he 's out of breath . He tries again . ) SHOOTER ( motioning to chair ) There it is . JEEP I 'm okay here . ( SHOOTER looks at him for a while . ) SHOOTER You do n't want it ? ( no answer from JEEP , who keeps eating ) Do n't you want it ? ( Still no answer from JEEP . SHOOTER moves in front of the armchair and collapses into it , staring out at the audience. ) p. 23 SHOOTER Aaaaaaaah ! This is the life . Now I 'm glad I went through all that . LIZA ( to SHOOTER ) Are n't you hungry ? SHOOTER No . I 'm glad . ( He folds his arms behind his head and smiles . ) LIZA ( standing ) Well , time to wash up . ( She starts gathering all the dishes together very quickly , whipping the plates out from under everyone . JEEP and LUPE pick their teeth and smack their lips loudly . ) JEEP ( with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shooter ? There 's plenty of water . SHOOTER Nope . This is it for me . I 'm never leaving this chair . I 've finally found it . JEEP ( standing and moving to the bucket on the table ) I 'm gon na ' have some water . I 'd be glad to get you a cup if you want . LUPE He just said he does n't want any . ( JEEP stands by the bucket with a cup in one hand . He dips the cup into the bucket , raises the cup slowly , and tips the water back into the bucket , watching the trickle of water as he does it . He keeps doing this over and over as though hypnotized by his own action . When LIZA has all the dishes she exits upstage leaving the remains of the turkey on the table. ) p. 24 LUPE Does anyone want to read ? ( pause ) SHOOTER I 'm never leaving again . LUPE I do n't mind looking for the place . ( She goes and picks up the book on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She looks through it . ) SHOOTER I could conduct all my business from here . I 'll need a bedpan and some magazines . JEEP ( looking at the remains of the turkey ) We should save the bones for soup . SHOOTER This is more like it . This is more in line with how I see myself . I picture myself as a father . Very much at home . The world ca n't touch me . JEEP Shooter ? You remember when you were scared ? Shooter ? You remember ? Oh , Shooter ? SHOOTER Naw . I do n't remember that . Better to leave that . People are washing dishes now . Lupe 's looking for the place again . Things are rolling right along . Why bring that up ? LUPE ( in the book ) Was n't it around where the spaceship had collided with the neutron ? JEEP Shooter , I remember . I remember you were so scared you could n't go up to take a bath . p. 25 SHOOTER Naw . That 's not me at all . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been an accident . JEEP Oh . ( JEEP keeps pouring the water over his hand . ) SHOOTER I 've never been afraid of baths . I 've always been brave in those situations . I 've plunged right in . JEEP Oh , I thought it was you . SHOOTER I knew a guy once who was afraid to take a bath . Something about the water . Stank to high heaven . " High Heaven . " That 's a good one . He stank , boy . Boy , how he stank . Boy , did he ever stink . JEEP Was it the water ? SHOOTER Yeah . Something about how it distorted his body when he looked down into it . JEEP Then , it was n't the water . SHOOTER Yeah . The water . The way it warped his body . JEEP But that 's just the way he saw it . That was him , not the water . SHOOTER Then , he began to fear his own body . JEEP From that ? From seeing it in the water ? SHOOTER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his body . He 'd lie awake . Afraid to sleep for fear his body might do something without him knowing . He 'd keep watch on it . p. 26 JEEP Was he a close friend ? SHOOTER I knew him for a while . JEEP What happened to him ? SHOOTER His body killed him . One day it just had enough and killed him . JEEP What happened to the body ? SHOOTER It 's still walking around I guess . ( pause ) Would somebody tell Liza to bring me the flask ? LUPE ( not looking up from the book ) She 's washing the dishes . JEEP ( still pouring ) That 's an interesting story , Shooter . SHOOTER Thank you . JEEP How did it get started ? SHOOTER What ? JEEP I mean how did he get into this relationship ? SHOOTER Who knows . It developed . One day he found himself like that . LUPE ( without looking up ) Remember the days of mass entertainment ? JEEP No . LUPE ( not looking up ) This could never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Always something to do . I once was very active in the community . p. 27 JEEP What 's a community ? LUPE ( looking up ) A sense of  --  A sense um  --  What 's a community , Shooter ? SHOOTER Oh uh  --  You know . You were on the right track . LUPE Something uh  --  JEEP I know . LUPE Yeah . You know . It does n't need words . ( She goes back into the book . ) JEEP I know what you mean . LUPE Just a kind of feeling . JEEP Yeah , I know what you mean . SHOOTER I think we 're beginning to get it a little . To get it back . I mean you can feel it even in the dead of winter . Sort of everybody helping each other out . JEEP Did he suspect his body of treason ? Was that it ? SHOOTER I 'm not sure . It was a touchy situation . ( SHOOTER rolls both his pants legs up above his knees and starts scratching his legs as he talks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I mean he could n't reach out . I mean he would n't expect anyone else to be in the same boat probably . p. 28 SHOOTER Probably not . LUPE ( without looking up ) Well it is rare . JEEP Was it in a particular time of hardship ? SHOOTER I ca n't rightly say . JEEP I mean were things crumbling ? SHOOTER I suspect he could n't see it . I mean I suspect he had his ideas . His opinions . Certain stiff attitudes . LUPE ( not looking up ) When was this ? JEEP And his body 's still walking around ? SHOOTER That 's right . A walking stiff . JEEP Can anyone tell ? I mean if we ran into this body could we tell it was vacant ? SHOOTER I 'm not sure . LUPE ( still thumbing through the book ) Well , how could you tell ? JEEP ( to LUPE ) There must be a way . I mean something must be missing . You could tell if he was n't all there . SHOOTER I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How could you tell ? p. 29 JEEP You 'd know . I 'd know . I mean with us , we know . We know . We hear each other . We hear our voices . We know each other 's voice . We can see . We recognize each other . We have a certain  --  We can tell who 's who . We know our names . We respond . We call each other . We sort of  --  We  --  We 're not completely stranded like that . I mean  --  It 's not  --  It 's not like that . How that would be . ( Pause as JEEP slowly pours the water over his hand . SHOOTER scratches his legs . LUPE thumbs through the book . After a short while SHOOTER sits back in the armchair with a jerk and holds his stomach . ) SHOOTER I 'm starving . Did we eat already ? LUPE ( still in book ) You were n't here . SHOOTER I was here . I was here all along . LUPE ( in book ) Not at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chair with his pants legs still rolled up . LUPE and JEEP pay no attention . ) SHOOTER You mean you ate without me ! ( Pause as SHOOTER looks around the space slowly . ) SHOOTER ( to himself ) Now I 'm beginning to regret my decision . p. 30 LUPE What . SHOOTER ( gazing around him in amazement ) To stay in the chair . LUPE Oh . SHOOTER It was shortsighted . I 'd give anything just to travel around this space . Just to lick the corners . To get my nose in the dust . To feel my body moving . LUPE ( referring to book ) Was it near the place where the sky rained fire ? SHOOTER I can picture it . I give in to it . I let my body go . It moves out . It sniffs the board . My head imagines forests ! Chain saws ! Hammers and nails in my ears ! A whole house is being built ! LUPE ( in book ) Keep it to yourself . SHOOTER My nose finds things . Everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ends again , and I 'm back in the chair . But now I 've ruined it . Now I 've had my cake . Now neither one is any good . The chair does n't get it on , and neither does the adventure . I 'm nowhere . LUPE I 'm trying to concentrate . SHOOTER Shall I tell a story ? LUPE ( looking up from book ) Oh God ! If I could find the place we could read a story ! p. 31 SHOOTER ( still standing ) I 'll tell a story . I feel like a story . Jeep ? How ' bout it ? JEEP ( still pouring water , blankly ) You bet . LUPE ( back into book ) Oh Jesus ! ( Through the story which SHOOTER tells standing on the armchair , JEEP keeps pouring the water slowly over his hand into the bucket , and LUPE keeps looking through the book . SHOOTER tells it directly to the audience . ) SHOOTER One night there was some moths . A bunch of moths . In the distance they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ window of a big house . The moths were tormented by this candle . They longed to be with this candle but none of them understood it or knew what it was . The leader of the moths sent one of them off to the house to bring back some information about this light . The moth returned and reported what he had seen , but the leader told him that he had n't understood anything about the candle . So another moth went to the house . He touched the flame with the tip of his wings but the heat drove him off . When he came back and reported , the leader still was n't satisfied . So he sent a third moth out . This moth approached the house and saw the candle flickering inside the window . He became filled with love for this candle . He crashed against the glass and finally found a way inside . He threw himself on the flame . WIth his forelegs he took hold of the flame and united himself joyously with her . He embraced her completely , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the moths , who was watching from far off with the other moths , saw that the flame and the moth appeared to be one . He turned to the other moths and said : " He 's learned what he wanted to know , but he 's the only one who understands it . " ( JEEP suddenly slaps the water in the bucket with his free hand and pulls a large dead fish out of the bucket and throws it on the floor . SHOOTER looks down on it from the chair . LUPE sticks with the book. ) p. 32 JEEP I 've about had it with this bucket ! I ca n't figure out what I 've been doing here all this time . SHOOTER ( still standing and looking down at the fish ) How deep is our well anyway ? JEEP ( to LUPE ) What 's happened to Liza ? LUPE Washing dishes . JEEP ( to LUPE ) Have I been standing here all this time ? LUPE ( looking up ) I do n't know ! I 've been looking for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone ! SHOOTER I 'm not standing up here because I 'm afraid of fish , I 'll tell you that much . I was standing up here before the fish ever arrived . It 's just a coincidence . It 's not the way it looks . JEEP Shooter , could you create some reason for me to move ? Some justification for me to find myself somewhere else ? SHOOTER Only if you promise that you 're not thinking that I 'm afraid of fish just because I 'm standing up here on the chair and there happens to be a fish in the house . JEEP I 'm not thinking about you ! ( Suddenly LUPE gives an exasperated exhale of air , slams the book shut , glares at the two men , stands and exits upstage . SHOOTER and JEEP are stuck in their respective positions . Short pause as they look at each other. ) p. 33 SHOOTER Go and pick up the fish . ( JEEP goes to the fish and picks it up . ) SHOOTER Go and put the fish on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facing audience , moves the turkey carcass to one side and lays the fish down on the table . ) SHOOTER ( still standing ) Take your jackknife out of your pocket . ( JEEP does it . ) SHOOTER Open your jackknife . The big blade . ( JEEP does it . ) SHOOTER Cut open the belly of the fish , starting from the pee-hole and slicing toward the head . ( JEEP cuts open the fish . ) SHOOTER Now clean it like you would any other fish . ( JEEP goes about cleaning the fish in silence . SHOOTER sits back down slowly in the chair . He looks at his bare legs . ) SHOOTER What 's been going on in here ? ( to JEEP ) Was there a party ? ( JEEP keeps cleaning the fish . SHOOTER looks at his legs again . ) SHOOTER Was someone taking liberties ? ( He leans back in the chair with a sigh. ) p. 34 SHOOTER It 's agonizing . All this time I could 've swore I was getting something done . I ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Did we eat already ? Was n't there a turkey ? ( turns front again and leans back ) Somebody 's gon na ' have to bring me some food , you know . I 've made this decision not to leave the chair and I 'm gon na ' stick with it . Come hell or high water . It 's not my fault . ( back to JEEP ) I could have the fish . When you 're finished with it , could you fry it up and bring it to me ? If it 's not too much trouble ? ( no response from JEEP , SHOOTER turns front again and leans back in the chair ) This is n't the worst . It 's just that my stomach is growling . I COULD N'T STAY HERE FOREVER ! I do n't know what possessed me. ( back to JEEP ) Did n't I say that I 'll never leave the chair ? ( back front again ) If I get up , it would be a sign of my weakness . Jeep ? If I got up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) This is n't the worst thing that could happen . ( short pause ) JEEP The table 's littered with carcasses . Guts . Bones . The insides . I 'm in the middle of all this . SHOOTER Who are you talking to ? p. 35 JEEP I 'm swimming in it . SHOOTER ( still front ) It 's nobody 's fault , you know . JEEP I ca n't help eating . I 'll eat to my dying day . SHOOTER Oh , brother ! ( SHOOTER gives a heave and a groan and pushes with his feet so that the armchair tips over backwards with him in it . The bottom of the chair conceals SHOOTER from the audience . Only his voice is heard . JEEP continues with the fish methodically . ) JEEP ( looking at the fish ) If you were alone would you have done that ? SHOOTER I 'm still in the chair . I 'm sticking to my promise . JEEP You would n't call it showing off ? SHOOTER I 'm at my wit 's end . The whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upstage . Each one holds a handle on either end of a large wicker basket full of wet laundry . LUPE is now wearing LIZA 'S apron with the pockets full of clothespins . They haul the basket down left center where the clothesline is . They set the basket down on the floor , and LUPE grabs one of the chairs and stands up on it to reach the clothesline LIZA starts handing her the wet clothes , one piece at a time , from the basket , while LUPE pins them onto the line and pulls the line out , making room for the next piece . Gradually the clothes are strung clear across the stage but high enough so as not to block too much of the action . JEEP keeps working on the fish , cutting the head off , scaling it , fileting it , cleaning it off in the bucket of water , etc . He is very meticulous about it and gets more involved as he goes along . SHOOTER remains hidden behind the armchair . The two girls remain closed off in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better already . You remember before when I was getting the fears ? SHOOTER No . When was that ? JEEP When I was asking you if you remembered when you were scared to go up and take a bath . SHOOTER That was a long time ago . JEEP I 'm getting better now . Even in the middle of all this violence . SHOOTER You should 've told me you were scared . I would 've done something about it . I did n't realize you were scared . JEEP I 'm in a better position now . Now I 've got something to do . ( SHOOTER pulls the armchair over on top of himself so that his arms stick out the sides like a headless turtle . He moves the chair slightly from side to side with his back . The women continue in silence with the laundry . ) JEEP I can even imagine how horrifying it could be to be doing all this , and it does n't touch me . It 's like I 'm dismissed . SHOOTER Am I completely hidden ? JEEP @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JEEP Maybe . p. 37 SHOOTER That 's what it 's like . JEEP Maybe that 's it , then . Gone . ( SHOOTER starts moving the armchair slowly around like a giant tortoise . The girls pay no attention . ) SHOOTER That 's it all right . Flown the coop . Is there anyone to verify ? To check it out ? JEEP ( looking at the girls ) Are you sure you want to ? SHOOTER Maybe it 's better like this . We can keep it a secret . JEEP Are you sure you 're not there ? SHOOTER More or less . Something creeps back , now that you mention it . JEEP Oh . SHOOTER What 's the matter ? JEEP I do n't know . I got no references for this . Suddenly it 's shifted . SHOOTER What 's the matter ? You have to clue me in . JEEP Once I was in a family . I had no choice about it . I lived in different houses . I had no choice . I could n't even choose the wallpaper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I found myself in schools . In cars . I got arrested . That was when it changed . The second I got arrested . p. 38 SHOOTER Have you forgotten about me ? JEEP The second I got arrested I understood something . I remember the phrase " getting in trouble . " I remember the word " trouble . " I remember the feeling of being in trouble . It was n't until I got in trouble that I found out my true position . SHOOTER What was that ? JEEP I was in the world . I was up for grabs . I was being taken away by something bigger . SHOOTER The cops ? JEEP Something bigger . Bigger than family . Bigger than school . Bigger than the 4-H Club . Bigger than Little League Baseball . This was Big Time . My frame of reference changed . SHOOTER Did you go to jail ? JEEP I went everywhere . Cop car , court , jail , cop car , jail , court , cop car , home , cop car , jail . And everywhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new details . Every scar was noted down . Every mark . The lines in my fingers . Hair . Eyes . Change in the pocket . Knives . Race . Age . Every detail . SHOOTER Who was interested ? JEEP A vast network . A chain of events . I entered a new world . SHOOTER Were n't you scared ? p. 39 JEEP I used to have this dream that would come to me while I was on my feet . I 'd be on my feet just standing there in these walls , and I 'd have this dream come to me that the walls were moving in . It was like a sweeping kind of terror that struck me . Then something in me would panic . I would n't make a move . I 'd just be standing there very still , but inside something would leap like it was trying to escape . And then the leap would come up against something . It was like an absolutely helpless leap . There was no possible way of getting out . I could n't believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world could get me out of there . I 'd relax for a second . I 'd be forced to relax because if I did n't , if I followed through with this inward leap , if I let my body do it I 'd just crash against the wall . I 'd just smash my head in or something . I had to relax . For a second I could accept it . That I was there . In jail . That I was n't getting out . No escape . For a second . Then these thoughts would come . " How long ? How long was I there for ? A day . Maybe I could last a day . A week . A month ? I 'd never last a month ! FOREVER ! " That 's the thought that did it . FOREVER ! And the whole thing would start up again . Except worse this time . As though it was n't just a thought . As though it really was . And then I 'd start to move . I could n't help myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move around the stage . The words animate him as though the space is the cell he 's talking about but not as though he 's recalling a past experience but rather that he 's attempting his own escape from the space he 's playing in . The other actions continue in their own rhythm . ) I 'd start to make sounds . It just came out of me . A low moan . An animal noise . I was moving now . I was stalking myself . I could n't stop . Everything disappeared . I had no idea what the world was . I had no idea how I got there or why or who did it . I had no references for this . ( JEEP just stands there . The others continue their actions . Lights fade slowly to black . The Christmas tree keeps blinking. )                                        @
