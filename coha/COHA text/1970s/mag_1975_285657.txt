Ever since it acted as host to the 1968 Winter Olympics , the city of Grenoble ( pop. : 380,000 ) has been trying to improve itself even more , becoming France 's laboratory for urban planning . Now , in an ambitious move that is being watched by urban planners everywhere , the city is moving to reduce the number of private automobiles that clog and pollute its streets . <P> Last fall Grenoble started to extend its bus and trolley systems . Now it is testing a new kind of " people mover " - an aerial tramway akin to a ski lift that may be extended from the city center to the suburbs . The city is also giving downtown shoppers a break ; cars have been banned on three streets which have become pedestrian malls . By 1980 , Mayor Hubert Dubedout predicts , downtown will be served exclusively by public transport-a pedestrian 's paradise , with no automobiles to be seen . <P> Free Choice . When this type of plan has been tried elsewhere , it has usually failed . Transit facilities simply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ auto . So Grenoble is promoting a humble alternative . " The bicycle offers door-to-door convenience , " says Traffic Engineer Alain Leclerc , head of what he calls " the Two Wheels in Grenoble " program . " It also offers free choice of departure time and destination , plus the possibility of moving about without taking a hard-to-park ton of steel along with you . " In case of inclement weather or too many parcels or small children , mass transit would always be available . By geological accident , moreover , the Grenoble valley is almost flat , and thus is ideal for bicycling . The only drawback : auto and truck traffic has made bicycling too dangerous . <P> One solution is to separate bicyclists from motorists , and Grenoble has budgeted $1.2 million to do just that . By 1979 there will be six miles of exclusive bicycle lanes , either built along new urban roads or reserved on downtown streets . No other European city has gone so far , nor has any city anywhere treated a grid of bikeways as an integral part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is installing racks at bus stops , where bike owners can change from two-wheelers to four . <P> Will bike riders opt for the safe bikeways if it means taking a longer route to their destinations ? To find out , Leclerc is now setting up a test bicycle path alongside a heavily used downtown street . But he is already convinced that " a bike should become a second car - perfect for cities .
