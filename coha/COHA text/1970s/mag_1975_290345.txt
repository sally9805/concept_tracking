&gt; Should medical scientists be allowed to conduct research on unborn or newly aborted fetuses ? No , said the Department of Health , Education and Welfare last year , as it clapped a nationwide ban on fetal studies . But last week HEW reversed itself . Outgoing HEW Secretary Caspar Weinberger announced new rules that would permit hundreds of studies involving fetuses to go ahead . The rules , which apply to all projects funded by HEW , do not give researchers unrestricted rights to experiment on the unborn . Doctors still will be forbidden to carry out any experiment that would end the life of a fetus that had survived abortion , or to conduct any studies that involve keeping fetuses alive artificially - unless they were aimed at preserving the lives of premature babies in general .

Lately , a number of fashion-conscious Los Angeles matrons have been urging their friends to smear it on nightly in order to " close " facial pores and shrink those age-betraying bags under the eyes . " It gives you a dewy look , " says Ellen Bennett , who runs a custom wig salon . But Daniel Eastman , a leading Beverly Hills skin-care specialist , protests that it is an " outrageous " fad , and a number of dermatologists back him up .

But physicians warn that like any other medication , it should be used only as directed-and the face , they point out , is not the part of the anatomy mentioned in the instructions on the label .
