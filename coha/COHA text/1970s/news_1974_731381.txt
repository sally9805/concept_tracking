txt In a new contribution to the Kremlin debate on the summit meeting which is to be held at the end of this month , Soviet Defense Minister Andrei A. Grechko argues forcefully for a " qualitative leap " in Soviet arms development . If he manages to extract from the Politburo the authority to go ahead , the chances of reaching a meaningful arms agreement at the Moscow summit will be much reduced . Marshal Grechko 's argument is evidently designed to convince the Kremlin that the Soviet arms program is so well advanced that it would be a pity to abandon it halfway , in return for Nixon promises that may not be fulfilled . The " necessary prerequisites , " he says , are now being created for this new arms " leap " ? scientific and technical , economic and military . The Soviet Union now has " considerable experience " in making new weapons . Measures are being taken to " perfect " the defense " production base . " Why waste all this huge investment , he seems to be saying , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a weapons buildup is suggested . A halt such as this is precisely the issue now . Because of opposition to it by hardline factions in both Washington and Moscow , the summit agreement will fall far below Mr. Nixon 's and Party Secretary Leonid I. Brezhnev 's original expectations . But just how far it falls depends on the outcome of Dr. Kissinger 's struggle with the hard-liners in Washington , and on the parallel struggle in Moscow , which will no doubt continue until the summit begins . // *Arms pact under fire in Kremlin // Already in Washington the Pentagon is " leaking " details of new Soviet missile deployments , and the Kissinger faction is worried by what such disclosures may do to the negotiations . In Moscow , the " leak " is not yet the main tool of bureaucratic in-fighting . A mighty pen The time-honored Kremlin weapon is the long historical or philosophical article where the practical message peeps out from between the lines , as it does in Marshal Grechko 's 17-page contribution to a party journal . His main ally , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last month , also in a " historical " context , that although imperialism was weakened by World War II , it had not abandoned its objective ? the " destruction " of communism . The imperialists , he argued , had now regrouped their forces and had launched preparations for " a new world . " This required the Soviet Union , he said , to strengthen its defenses ? by which he meant , as he had indicated elsewhere , that he wants more ships . Article 's repeated call Marshal Grechko , in his article , repeatedly comes back to the need to strengthen the Soviet Union 's military might and combat readiness , which he says has " now assumed particular importance because the possibility of a sudden attack ' by an aggressor has increased . " His arguments for the buildup , a dozen of which may be found in various parts of the article , cite Lenin as saying more than 50 years ago that even the best Army would be rapidly annihilated by the enemy if it was not adequately armed . " A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proposi tions , " he explains , " has increased particularly under present-day conditions . " Historical perspective The historical evidence which Marshal Grechko uses is important for the political argument he is trying to advance . Because Western enemies refused to " abandon " their anti-Soviet designs after both world wars , and even began preparing " a preventive nuclear attack " against the Soviet Union , there was only one thing to do ? and this alone " cooled U.S. imperialism 's aggressive intentions . " Defensive might Guess what ? " The strengthening of the country 's defense might . " There is no room in his argument for the mutual concessions by both the Soviet Union and the United States which Mr. Brezhnev and his spokesmen have been advocating as the only way to an arms limitation agreement . One of the leading commeptators on the government paper , Izvestla , Alexander Bovin , who had been arguing for mutual arms cuts , and was attacked sharply for his supposed ideological " errors " in a military journal , has come back into the fray with an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issue . Each side in the negotiations , he says , tries to extract the greatest possible advantage , but it also knows that " in order to get something , you have to give something up , " Each side understands this , he adds pointedly , at least " should understand it . " Opposing view clear Nor is his point directed against the United States . Certain " left-wing theoreticians " whom he does not identify but who are clearly recognizable from the context as his military opponents " have been brought into a state of rage , " he says , by the very mention of " necessary and inevitable compromises . " The compromise at issue concerns SALT  --  and the summit . While Marshal Grechko and his spokesmen press for more and better arms as the only reliable guarantee of Soviet " security , " Mr. Bovin responds with the diametrically opposite Brezhnevite argument . To base general security on " constantly growing arsenals " of rocket-nuclear weapons , he said , is to perpetuate the threat of war . In the Soviet debate , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as they are in Washington , but the issues are the same ? how to stop the arms race . ? Victor Zorga
