txt Klmin Chres , Cambodia At an informal dinner recently President Thieu of South Vietnam spoke enthusiastically about the possibilities of aiding the Cambodian Government in its struggle for survival . But a long interview in Ilw field with one of the South Vietnamese President 's leading military commanders illustrates the enormous dialcult:c : ; involved in achieving any kind of fruitful cooperation between the South Vietnamese and the Cambodians . " The Cambodians tell you one thing , and then they go off and do another , " said Lt. Gen. Do Cao Tri , commander of the III Corps , one of South Vietnam 's four military regions . " Frankly , we just do n't understand the Cambodians , " said the three-star general whose troops have been sweeping through the " Parrot 's Beak " area of Ca mbodia . Disappointment voiced " I 'm very disappointed that even with the support of our army , the Cambodians are not more aggressive , " he said . One could imagine some American Army advisers saying similar things about their South Vietnamese counterparts when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or six years ago . Today , the South Vietnamese Army still has its problems . Few would pretend that it approaches the North Vietnamese army in terms of leadership , discipline , and experience . But it has obviously improved over the last few years . It has certainly become one of the most heavily armed and powerful fighting forces in Southeast Asia . And the South Vietnamese intervention in Cambodia has made South Vietnam 's generals more fully aware of this fact . General Tri , who wears dark glasses . a red beret . and a camouflage uniform , and carries a small pistol strapped to his chest , is a small man whose lower lip protrudes pugnaciously from his jaw . He reminds one of a bantam fighting cock . Doubts clear enough Tile general is noted for his candor , and when it comes to the question of working with the Cambodians. he does n't mind telling you its not easy . President Thieu had implied that the South Vietnamese might get involved in helping to train the Cambodian Army . General Tri was asked about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How can we train them ? There are differences of language , differences of mentality . Impossible . " We 've asked the Cambodians if they want to go out on operations with us . But they prefer to stay bottled up in their cities just waiting for the Viet Cong to come and get them . " Eight Viet Cong could take over a Cambodian city . and I could do the same with eight of my men . " he added . What about intelligence ? Could n't the Cambodians provide some useful information to the South Vietnamese ? " They have no intelligence , " said the general . " Sometimes they tell us there are 1,000 or even 10,000 Viet Cong in a certain area , and when we check we find there may have been one Viet Cong soldier there  --  one Viet Cong . " // *Saigon skeptical of Cambodian allies // " If we believed everything the Cambodians told us and added it all up , it would probably come to a million Viet Cong . " " I 'm thinking of disarming the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of these days they 're going to lose all their weapons to the Viet Cong . " The general likes to get out with . his troops , and part of the interview was conducted on the back of an armored personnel carrier ( APC ) while we rolled through the open Cambodian countryside . Only recently , two soldiers sitting next to General Tri on an APC had been severely wounded , he said . " My cavalrymen are very brave , and when they make contact with the enemy , they do n't hesitate to charge straight into the enemy positions . " Just trophies ' Many of the APC 's were flying the blue , red , and white Cambodian national flag on their radio aerials , and when asked if the Cambodians might not feel insulted by this , he replied " Oh , the flags are just prophies . " The general gestured with his silver tipped swagger stick at a group of Cambodian peasants standing outside their farm-house looking somewhat bewildered as the armored vehicles roared past them . " These villagers are more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cambodian Army has been looting around Soai Rieng . They do n't like fighting , but they do n't mind looting from their own people . It 's terrible . " There are many , many Cambodian young men in these villages , " he continued . " But because of the difficulty we have in speaking with them , we are not able to tell if they are for Sihanouk , Lon Nol or the Viet Cong . " The general said speculation that the South Vietnamese might eventually try to annex a part of Cambodia , such as the Parrot 's Beak area , was incorrect . " We have no interest in doing anything like that . What we want to do is protect our own territory . We do n't have any intention of staying in Cambodia permanently . " He also acknowledged that the traditional enmity between the Vietnamese and Cambodians would make it difficult to carry out an occupation of Cambodia . But he emphasized that the South Vietnamese Army was not bound by President Nixon 's June 30 deadline for the withdrawal of U.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here until we destroy their caches and sanctuaries , " he said . " It may take many more weeks , or even months , to clean them out . Every day we are finding more caches . If we feel we must go in again a year from now , we will go in . " What if the Americans cut off logistical support for future South Vietnamese operations in Cambodia ? " I do n't think there will be any problem . We have always had very close cooperation with the Americans . "
