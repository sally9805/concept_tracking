txt When political oratory was in full flood during Britain 's recent elections , the politicians emphasized their various prescriptions for the longterm welfare of Britain . But now all that is over because the new government ? whichever it may be ? has one simple priority task which concerns the immediate future . It is going to have to borrow a lot of money from every possible foreign source . In theory there are alternatives . Another devaluation of the pound could defer the day of borrowing a little ? until more inflation wiped out the gains . And the government could arbitrarily cut imports to the value of exports . But that would mean rationing of food and oil and would lead into an industrial recession which in turn would mean mounting unemployment . Neither is a politically feasible alternative . So a-borrowing the new govern- ment must go , just as fast and soon as possible . And that in turn means that the new government must adjust itself to domestic policies which will attract the confidence of those who can loan the necessary funds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policies which would alienate the overseas purveyors of loans . Main target of the Treasury is the International Monetary Fund . There are ' other sources , including private banks and the U.S. Federal Reserve System . // Further reproduction prohibited without permission . * Victors must borrow to bail out pound // The amount needed to support the pound and avoid another devaluation is being estimated at around ? 3 billion to ? 4 billion ( upwards of $7 billion ) . This is taken largely from the fact that Britain is running behind on current balance of payments at a rate which would mean a 4 billion deficit for the year . The sudden rise of raw material prices paced by oil has made the big difference in the balance of payments . The cost of British imports has gone up radically . The earnings from exports have gone up , but modestly . The spread is at the 4 billion a year rate right now . But , of course , the hope is that by the end of another year this condition will have proved to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back into relative balance . Besides , oil is beginning to gush at a rising rate from Britain 's own new North Sea oil fields . There is even a vivid hope that by 1980 Britain will not only be able to supply all of her own oil needs , but also will , be able to export oil . It could make a huge difference to a country which must meanwhile go to the lenders for enough money to keep the country solvent and its industry growing . ? Restraint necessary This condition rules out any new nationalization plans so beloved by the Labour Party 's left . It also calls for budget and price and wage restraint . No one wants to lend to a spendthrift . The most hopeful feature of the election returns was that the voters seemed to sense the importance to their country 's welfare of prudent restraints and modest budgets . If only the new men who will be taking over the leadership will know how to summon the people to a period of restraint and austerity ? the chances are that the people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the affluent society , the British people have been enjoying a rising standard of living . The Conservative slogan during the green years was " you never had it so good . " INow the need is for a return to that austerity which for the first 12 years after World War II laid the foundations for the green years .
