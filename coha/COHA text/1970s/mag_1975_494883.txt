Terrorism : A Debate I Michael Walzer The November 22 issue of The New Republic carried two articles on terrorism , by Roger Morris and J. Bowyer Bell , which in some measure responded to my piece , " The New Terrorists " ( TNR , August 30 , 1975 ) . Morris and Bell reflect a widespread attitude ( expressed also in many of the letters I have received ) that seems to me more frightening than terrorism itself . It might best be described as a loss of moral confidence . In Morris ' case , the loss is reflected as much in the style as in the substance of his essay . He starts by accepting the distinction I suggested between " the calculated limited murder of political personalities that began in the 19th century " and contemporary terrorism with its random killing . Then he tries to explain the shift from the one to the other . " In some degree , at least , we may be watching a violent reaction to the failure of mass democracy no less rationalized than the attack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " An enigmatic sentence : of course , terrorism is rationalized in terms of an antidemocratic ideology ; every political view is rationalized in some terms or other . The question that has to be faced takes a different form : is it rational ? Mr. Morris wants to suggest that it is , but he does not want to say so . And for good reason . He goes on : " For the revolutionaries of the 1970s , the perceived hypocrisy and betrayal of the American system might easily be seen as a common responsibility , every citizen an accomplice in the status quo . . " Note again the indirect phrasing : might easily be seen . Squinting , one can see almost anything , but is it there ? Does that common responsibility actually exist ? Imagine that during the Vietnam war , American terrorists had placed bombs in restaurants and bars , bus stations , supermarkets and schools . Would the people they killed ? all of them ? ? any of them ? have been " responsible " for the war ? Morris knows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He also knows more than he says about the effectiveness of terrorism . We ca n't go on pretending , he argues , that terrorist violence is bound to be ineffective . Vicious and wanton as it has been , PLO terrorism is unquestionably a factor in the Middle East . . . Terror was an influence in Vietnam , both in the atrophy of the Saigon government and in provoking US escalations ? . . It has altered the politics of Northern Ireland beyond return , and may lead there , for better or worse , to a partition that no other means could have produced . Now , it 's never been claimed that terrorism has no effects ; dead bodies are its first and most lasting effects , but there are no doubt other effects as well . What we need to know is whether terrorism has or can have the effects the terrorists claim to be seeking , and whether it has or can have effects that liberals and Socialists might conceivably endorse . Let 's look at Morris ' cases . ( I will leave aside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Vietcong assassination campaign of the early 1960s , which was aimed at government officials and ? whatever one wants to say about it ? was not an example of random killing . ) The PLO claims to have as its goal the creation of a democratic secular state in which Jews and Arabs might live in peace . Clearly , however , the indiscriminate murder of Jews does not serve that end . What end does it serve ? It might one day lead , along with many other factors , to the creation of a Palestinian state , but a state of a particular sort , one dominated by the terrorists . If one aimed at any other sort of Palestinian state , one might imagine other ways of getting it . Similarly with the " provisional " wing of the IRA : its stated end is a unified and democratic Ireland , and that is the one goal that its means will never produce . A new partition , perhaps ; but then we would want to know ? for better or for worse ? Because he does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reader with a vague sense that terrorism works . It may indeed work for the terrorists , but not for the rest of us . That has to be said , and firmly , or else the " repugnance " that Morris professes to feel and undoubtedly does feel in the face of terrorism will seem merely pious . One inevitably suspects that political acceptance hides just behind the outrage . I do n't think it does , in this case ; what is hidden is a great anxiety about expressing outrage . The reasons for the anxiety are made clear in the last paragraph of Mr. Bell 's more extended and informative article . Bell is worrying about the possibility of a repressive response to terrorism : Outraged indignation should fit uncomfortably on those who gave us the holocaust or the fire-bombing of Hamburg or a century of large-scale brutality , but it does not . More to the point , such indignation is partisan . The wave of protest over the Spanish executions indicates that some gunmen are more acceptable than others , especially if they have an odious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's terrorist is another 's patriot . From the seat of power in Rome or London or Madrid the gunmen are wicked , evil men who must be destroyed by any means , by all means . And therein lies the danger . This is an incredibly confused passage , but one that makes , again , a typical argument . Let 's unravel it slowly , beginning with the Spanish executions . The executed men were accused of killing government officials , not of random murder . They had actually taken some care not to injure innocent bystanders , and one might therefore prefer them to , say , the IRA or the PLO without reference to the cause they served . In any case many of us who protested the executions did so because the so-called " terrorists " had not received anything resembling a fair trial ? not because we believe that assassins , if their cause is just , can never be punished . We would protest executions of that sort wherever they took place . Finally the men and women who occupy " seats of power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the holocaust or the fire-bombing of Hamburg . In what possible sense is it hypocritical for them to feel indignant if their countrymen are murdered ? Bell 's argument here is like the one we heard all through the Watergate crisis : everybody does it , why blame Nixon ? Everybody does it , why be outraged at the IRA ? In Watergate , the argument did n't work , since we all knew that Nixon was a " wicked man . " But neither Morris nor Bell is willing to say the same about the " gunmen from the ditch . " And what about the rest of us ? The implication of Bell 's last paragraph , and of the way of thinking that I have taken him to represent , is that we should feel a kind of general guilt about state violence in the 20th century and therefore hold back from attacking political terrorism . In fact , however , the same principles apply to the two sorts of brutality , and ought to be applied in every case . It is bizarre to suggest that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vietnam ) the murder of innocent people in Belfast , London and , Jerusalem should go uncondemned and unpunished . That is not moral delicacy ; it is simply a failure of nerve . II J. Bowyer Bell First one of the burdens of my article was that there is not nor is there likely to be a generally accepted definition of " terrorism " because even the killing of innocent people has been rationalized by states and revolutionaries on a variety of grounds . A great many who protested the Spanish executions , as Mr. Walzer is aware , were not unduly concerned about the slovenliness of Spanish judicial practice but rather about the nature of the government in Madrid . Many in Europe , indeed , are deeply sympathetic with the aims of the Basques and hardly outraged by their methods ; what more effective means to oppose Spanish tyranny or establish a Basque republic might be suggested . In any case that the Basque gunmen are preferable because they are more discriminating than the PLO and more efficient than the Provisional IRA indicates a spectrum of indignation ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officials , " a distinction undoubtedly lost on the widows of policemen shot down in ambush . However as long as Walzer intends to be outraged at every murder of innocent people ? however defined ? he is on sound logical and moral ground . The second point was that such indignation however logically and morally justified whether in Madrid or Jerusalem is not a sound foundation for an effective , rational response . Summary executions in Spain and bombing raids on Palestinian refugee camps arising from such understandable indignation appear from a distance to be counterproductive . Walzer , using the cases of the PLO and IRA , suggests that it does not and can not have the effect desired by the terrorists . Both cases are moot , but the aspirations of the Irgun Zvai Leumi and the Stern Gang in the Palestine Mandate and the IRA in Ireland were in part achieved by quite familiar activities . There is now a 26-county Ireland and an Israel . Certainly revolutionaries in Aden and Algeria and Angola feel that their armed struggles ? the imperialists ' campaigns of terror ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( and none when they began ) that recourse to violence was unnecessary . There are those who argue a terrorist act can be a means of saving life ; an assassin kills but one man ? a Count Bernadotte ? and changes history . Even if he does n't change history , still only a single life has been lost , not a battalion . And often nonviolence engenders far more violence than the assassin . In Northern Ireland in 1969 , a civil rights demonstration began the slow but most assuredly not inevitable descent into chaos . Anyway like most other acts of man , " terrorism " works much as intended sometimes and sometimes it does n't . And , as Walzer notes , in every case the only certainty is dead bodies . As long as some few men see no options but liberty or death , such bodies will be with us . I would , for the rebels I support , opt for efficiency , discrimination and rationality and , for the governments threatened by those I abhor , restraint , moderation and patience . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead and greater liberty . III Roger Morris Mr. Walzer is quite right that my description of terrorist perceptions was carefully worded . I was trying for a moment to draw beyond the usual self-protective smugness on this subject , to show how the " rationality " of terrorism " might " look to its adherents . That Walzer saw in that fugitive effort some " moral " flaw ( with " political acceptance " of murder lurking close in the margins ) is an alarming illustration of the problems we face in coming to grips with the new terror . The question of general and individual citizen responsibility for state policy in mass democracy is one of the most elusive in modern politics . Walzer 's certainty about the " innocence " of random parts of the populace does not make the matter less arguable ? nor , I 'm afraid , does it save any of us from those who believe the opposite . Would indiscriminate terrorism in the US during the Vietnam war have struck at the " responsible , " with any palpable effect therefore on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that question . As Nixon understood so well , the ground war had to end eventually because the draft of the middle class and the American coffins coming home were too close , too costly a price to pay . We went on with relative impunity , however , savaging a people with computers from 35,000 feet , and we reelected by the greatest margin in history the man who ordered it . Did we continue that detached genocide because it cost us so little ? Who was responsible ? Nixon ? Kissinger ? - The tens of thousands whose telegrams poured in to reinforce the worst instincts in an otherwise vacillating President after his speeches about " silent majorities " and " pitiful helpless giants " ? Can we so easily believe that the carnage would not have ended years sooner had Americans suffered directly some bloody consequences of their growing indifference to the war after 1970 ? In these terms , are " responsibility " and the " rationality " of terror as simple as Walzer suggests ? And if Vietnam and our own psychology are too painful to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ similarly ready to banish this unwieldy problem of " common responsibility " from the millions who voted for and tolerated Hitler or who cooperated in Stalin 's terror . Evil is indeed banal . But I suppose it depends on one 's vantage point to see the ambiguity in which that leaves so much that Walzer seems to take for granted . As for the effectiveness of terror , again I 'm not so comfortably sure , as Walzer obviously wants to be , that it does n't work . " Clearly , " he says , the murder of Jews ca n't attain the PLO goal . Aside from the foolish presumption of being " clear " about any outcome in the Middle East , there 's a lot of evidence , from the halls of the UN to the Israeli cabinet , that that 's precisely what will happen . And the new Palestinian state will be defying every precedent of modern history ( including Israel and the post-independence demise of the Irgun ) if its governance does n't very soon pass from the soldiers to the stolid bureaucrats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's truncated Catholic Northern Ireland pointlessly cut adrift by the IRA bombers . Do we really believe that entity would n't be joined to the republic , with Whitehall 's blessing as well as the good riddance of the Protestant successor state ? Perhapsnot . But that 's easily as plausible as anything else , and that too would be a realization of terrorist goals . Let me correct here what Walzer deplores in my article as " a vague sense " that terrorism can be successful : I think we are tragically myopic if we deny for a moment that it does and will work . But what about " the rest of us , " Walzer asks with that same revealing phrase twice in a thousand words . The " rest of us " indeed . Though I do n't know Walzer , I have a sinking suspicion that our disagreement here belongs too much to the sociology of knowledge . " It would not be difficult to imagine , " he says for example , " other ways " than terrorism to realize a Palestinian state . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been not only difficult but impossible for many Palestinians in their wretched camps to " imagine " those " other ways , " just as Walzer in his position finds it so impossible to entertain the conceivable rationality of terrorism . He worries about my anxiety to express outrage at terrorism ; I wonder about his capacity to understand the outrage that leads to terrorism . I wonder too how durable his sure and detached moralism would remain after Israeli Phantoms napalmed his family , after the British army occupying Cambridge threw him in a concentration camp for breaking a curfew . He reassures us that the " same principles " apply , or " ought " to apply , to state violence as to terrorism . But as Walzer the distinguished scholar knows very well , there is that fatal difference in reality between the " is " and the " ought . " We hunt and judge and sometimes execute our terrorists . When does the trial begin for the Israeli pilots who killed 74 people the other day in Lebanon , the hundreds of American officials who planned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surviving participants in the Hiroshima decision , the Bangladesh and Burundi genocide , the Chilean massacres ? Surely we have the elemental honesty to admit to ourselves that morality , justice and retribution are still largely a matter of who 's in the saddle . There is , to be sure , a difference between Nixon and the " gunman from the ditch " : Nixon was pensioned off not for his complicity in incalculable human suffering , but only for the most flagrant flouting of the mores of the ruling elite . As for a " loss of moral confidence , " I should think that 's the affliction of those who can not confront terrorism in its own rationality , or honestly admit , as I suggested in my article , the similarities as well as the differences between terrorism and our own day-to-day lives . The last time I was accused of a " failure of nerve " was in an argument with a Pentagon general over the invasion of Cambodia . It 's one thing for know-nothings to shun sensibility to oppression , to refuse to acknowledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to flee from moral complexity and self-knowledge to some shrinking island of " outrage . " When people of Michael Walzer 's gifts do it , we are in deeper trouble than I imagined . IV Michael Walzer The argument that I had to torture out of Roger Morris ' first article he now makes openly and explicitly , and it is clear that I disagree far more with him than with Mr. Bell . This is what his position comes to : we are all participants in the crimes of Vietnam ; we have no right , then , to condemn contemporary terrorism , but must seek instead to " understand " the desperation and outrage from which it springs . In the name of sensitivity , complexity and guilt ? guilt above all , for this is a doctrine for masochists ? we must accept terror as the legitimate weapon of the weak . The major difficulty with this argument , aside from its sackcloth and ashes tone , is that terrorism , the random murder of innocent people , is a new weapon while outrage and desperation are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ groups rejected terror , and even today the question whether or not to kill the innocent is an issue in every radical group ( except in the PLO where , so far as the public record shows , no opposition to terror on a principled basis has ever arisen ) . The issue is angrily debated , on both moral and political grounds . Morris ' position gives us no access to these debates . He is endlessly eager to understand the terrorists , but he does not even see their opponents . I do n't mean the " ruling elites , " but the men and women inside the Algerian FLN and the IRA and other similar groups who try to say no to murder . And he simply ignores the distinction that revolutionary militants once made between aiming at political targets and the deliberate premeditated killings of innocents . There are two traditional leftist arguments against terrorism . The first is simple and direct : we do n't kill innocent people ; that 's what they do , the forces of privilege and reaction ; indeed , that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The second argument is more political in character , though it also has moral implications : terrorism is not and can not be a mass activity ; it is the work of a small band of militants ; inevitably it enhances the self-regard and power of an elite and undercuts the possibility of democratic government . The alternative path is mass organization , strikes , demonstrations , guerrilla war . These methods " work " when there is broad popular support , and do n't work when there is n't ? and surely that 's what one wants to say of leftist politics generally , that it ought to succeed only insofar as it can mobilize masses of people . Roger Morris is " sensitive " to oppression , but he has no interest in the politics of the oppressed . He is ready with an a priori endorsement of anything they do ; he holds them to no standards , and that is finally to patronize them . They do n't require that kind of understanding . They need to be supported when they act rightly , and to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest of us . It was indeed no loss of nerve to attack the Pentagon at the time of the Cambodian invasion ; then Morris was insisting that there are moral limits on the use of power . But it is a loss of nerve to endorse terror : now Morris is refusing to apply those same limits , or for that matter any limits at all . To assuage his own guilt , he is willing to accept murder .
