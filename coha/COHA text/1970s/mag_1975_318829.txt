In 1852 a man named John Surratt built a two-story clapboard house in the Maryland countryside about ten miles from Washington , D.C. Soon it served as a tavern , polling place , post of fice and home for the Surratt family , and the area became known as Surrattsville . After Surratt died in 1862 , his widow Mary leased the building and moved to Washington , where she opened a boardinghouse . It was there , in 1865 , that John Wilkes Booth plotted the assassination of Abraham Lincoln . One of Booth 's associates , John Lloyd , turned state 's evidence and implicated Mrs. Surratt in the conspiracy . <P> Though Lloyd had been drunk during the critical conversation with Mrs. Surratt , an overzealous military court accepted his testimony . The widow-whose last words to a priest were " Father , I am innocent " - was hanged in July 1865 along with three alleged members of Booth 's cabal . The U.S. Government , meanwhile , had changed the name of Surrattsville to Robeystown ; today , it is known as Clinton , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure that one of their own had been wronged . <P> They continued to give their schools the Surrattsville name , and they kept a close eye on the Surratt house . In 1965 its last private owner donated it to the Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission . A group of local citizens raised money for its restoration , and last week it was formally dedicated as a historical monument . Boy Scouts directed traffic while an honor guard from nearby Andrews Air Force Base presented colors . Said Restoration Committee Chairman Thomas S. Gwynn Jr . to the 700 onlookers , including 30-odd Surratt descendants who attended the affair : " To remove this blot , this blemish , this cloud from the name of one of our local residents , is why we are here today .
