txt Letters to the Editor Letters to the Editor Of S.1 and the First Amendment To the Editor : It is distressing that , shortly prior to the announcement by several Senators of significant progress toward reaching a constructive compromise on S.1 , your recent editorial " Issues ' 76 : Liberty " reiterated the unfounded charge that S.1 contains " many questionable sections that are incompatible with the First Amendment " As noted by the former chairman of the National Commission on Reform of Federal Criminal Laws , Edmund G. Brown , in a letter to The Times : " A great deal of misinformation has been spread about S 1 Defeat would be a severe blow to criminal law reform in this country . " Unfortunately , your editorial contributes to the multiplication of misinformation and misimpression about the bill . For example , the obscenity provision in ? 5.1 would significantly narrow present Federal law by eliminating purely private transactions in such materials among willing adults from Federal proscription . Likewise , ** provisions on riot offenses , far from restricting the right of peaceful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S.C. 2101-2102 , a riot may consist of as few as three persons , and mere interstate travel with intent to incite a riot , followed by the performance of any overt act in furtherance of such intent , establishes the offenses . Under S.1 the minimum Tale of Two Cities To the Editor : I was interested to read of William J. Butler 's " Report on Human Rights in Iran " news story May 29 . As chairman of the New York City Bar Association 's Committee on International Human Rights perhaps he is out of his realm . It might make more sense to establish a Committee on National Human Rights and make a study of social oppression in the United States . While a few political dissidents in Iran are subjected to " psychological and physical torture , " a vast number of good citizens of . his own country are subjected to " psychological and physical torture " by a large criminal element protected and condoned by the very organization that he represents . While living and teaching in Teheran until a year ago , my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must dispute your June 2%editorial " Crisis in ? Mathematics " on both factual and .. personal grounds . Referring to Science magazine , you describe a debate in the branch of mathematics called homotopy theory , in which two investigators possess long , complicated and mutually contradictory proofs which can not be reconciled . The reference is to a paper by myself and Emery Thomas of Berkeley , which for a time was contradicted by work of H. Toda and S. Oka in Japan . The issue remained open for somewhat more than a year  --  which is not at all unusual when economists , biologists or even physicists argue ; the conflict drew attention precisely because such things are almost unheardof in mathematics . In any case , Toda and Oka found an error in their proof in July 1974 . The problem , you see , is not that , the proofs were too long and complicated  --  ours , for instance , took just thirteen pages . Rather , because homotopy theory is an abstruse field of no interest outside of mathematics , only one worker bothered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I have come to my own personal " Crisis in Mathematics . " Precisely because there is no " maybe " in ' mathematics , and because pure mathematics has become so relentlessly detached from reality . I have decided that I can not afford any more such victories . This fall I will enroll in medical school . ? RAPHAEL ZAHLER Associate Professor of Mathematics Rutgers University New Brunswick , N.J. , June 2 , 1976 ? How to Help the City To the Editor : To " demonstrate its commitment to New York and to have something with a tourist potential , " Citicorp is creating a street-level concourse of unusual food shops and restaurants under its " sky-top " building on the block between Lexington and Third Avenues at 53d and 54th Streets ( news story June 4 ) . While the structural number of persons is increased to ten , and ** indictment provision requires that a riot in fact result from the incitement . Similarly , Section 1302 of S.1 , which punishes obstruction of a Government function by physical interference , would only perpetuate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statutes ( e.g. , 18 U.S.C. 111 ) , often carrying greater penalties , punishing physical interference or obstruction with specific Federal Government functions . Prof. Archibald Cox of Harvard has written of this section to Senator Hart : " The A.C.L.U. criticism of Section 1302 is , in my opinion , a forced and false interpretation which would appear plausible only to one determined to find reasons for seeking to defeat the bill . " There is nothing in S.1 , as now before the Senate Judiciary Committee , to justify the charge that the bill contains provisions inimical to the First Amendment . Quite the contrary is true . I hope that the recent proposal by several Senators to effect significant further modifications of the bill in the areas about which you evinced concern will cause you to re-evaluate your attitude toward this most important piece of legislation . RICHARD THORNBURGH Assistant Attorney General Washington , June 3 , 1976 complete freedom to walk the streets and even in the bazaars at any time of day or night . We were never mugged , robbed or assaulted in more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a city of four million people , make headlines . In New York City there are numberless murders that take a line or two of space under " Metropolitan Briefs . " Where is there the greater freedom from fear ? Perhaps the good barrister , instead of taking junkets under the auspices of the International Commission of Jurists , should come home and try to straighten out a disgraceful legal system . that endangers us all . Let the Shah run his country as he has done so well in recent years , while we were suffering the Vietnam wars , vast political corruption and horrendous judicial malpractice . RICHARD L. CARLTON Washington , Conn. , June 3 , 1976 focus will be on an interior " atrium , " let 's hope Citicorp 's viewpoint is not entirely inward-looking . A commitment to our city can also be demonstrated by helping neighborhood groups drive out the male prostitutes ruining 53d street one block to the east ( news story May 31 ) and by working to close the topless/bottomless bars newly blighting the block directly across the street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York , June 6 , 1976 ? Medicine and Minorities To the Editor : President Cooper of the Association of American Medical Colleges has rejected the charge that medical school standards have dropped in recent years letter May 28 . Indeed , he cites evidence for improvement in average qualifications and performance . But my editorial in the New England Journal of Medicine , which made the charge , was not referring to the average level  --  either of medical classes as a whole or of minority students . Rather , I was addressing the problem of minimal standards for failing an unsatisfactory student . The numbers involved are too small to have lowered the average quality of medical education and practice , especially with the extraordinary recent increase in the number of brilliant applicants for medical school . Nevertheless , even a few inadequate physicians are important , both for the patients whom they treat and for the image of the profession . It is clear that most minority medical students have performed very well . Indeed , they have earned admiration for their perseverance in overcoming early disadvantages . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tarnished , and the communities served will suffer , if poorly qualified members of the group are also passed . That is the thrust of my editorial . Neither that article nor any other statement of mine justifies mistrust of minority students or minority physicians in general . BERNARD D. DAVIS Boston , June 1 , 1976 A Nice Place to Pollute ' To the Editor : Your May 28 editorial on the conspicuous waste of energy by our na : - don 's drivers was definitely on target . As a taxi driver and avid bicycle rider ; I get to see this situation from variedperspectives , and it seems to me that , , our local efforts to reduce energy consumption are going nowhere . For example , the Clean Air Act of 1970 is still being debated and fought in the courts . It has more potential good than harm , even if it does cause immediate economic dislocation . For , just like the nation , we are better off dealing with this problem now , rather than , when it becomes unmanageable . Passenger cars should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pollute , but I wouldn't1 want to be garaged there . " Truckshave to be encouraged to make nigh ( . , deliveries . As for taxis , cruising the ' : streets without a fare should hi ' ' , minimized . The most pressing modification to , the plan is the compromise of free ; access for passenger cars on weekends and in the evenings , so that our entertainment industry will not be ' destroyed . Rational modifications and ' , additions should be sought , instead of . possessing a xenophobic attitude that anything originating in Washington ' must be considered hazardous to our health . Try this one : coin-operated. bicycle stalls by subway stations and other major terminals , or bike and locks . How about institution of group taxi riding , especially at night when both buses and taxis ride around empty , and the passengers , taxi drivers and taxpayers all lose . Yet there are those who profit from au ; mutual loss , namely the sellers of the machines and fuel which we continue ' to waste . Why ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet its renaissance may be in , leading this nation away from its present fixation that " if you ca n't get there by car , you might as well stay home . " SAMUEL NADEL . Brooklyn , May 30 , 1976 ? Gainful ** Mail To the Editor : Some days ago The Times printed ? a letter from a gentleman in Martha ' , s ? , Vineyard which described the amount , of advertising mail the writer 's father received during a one-month period ? and indicated the additional revenue , that would accrue to the Postal Service if that mail had been sent firstclass . People think that first-class mail is more " profitable " to the Postal Service than third-class mail . The truth of the matter is , as stated by more than one Postmaster General , third-class mail makes a contribution to the Postal Service over and above the cost of handling it which helps keep the cost of first class down . Indeed , the two classes of mail are priced so that the cost to the sender in both cases is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cost . In addition to the Postal Service , the independent Postal Rate Commiasion has recognized that discouraging advertising  --  third-class  --  mail would be a detriment to the service . Louis A. KISLIK President , Publishers Clearing House Port Washington , L. I. , June 6 , 1976 ? The . Violent One To the Editor : In response to John E. Chappell 's May 31 letter , he obviously knows nothing of the post-Stalinist era . Mr. Chappell 's charge that " the United States , not the Soviet Union , has been the most aggressive , violent and destructive nation on earth " ( after the death of Stalin ) is apparently based on the American involvement in Vietnam . I agree that Vietnam was wrong ; but Mr. Chappell 's charge is also wrong . Mr. Chappell is apparently oblivious to : the Hungarian revolution of 1956 ; the Brezhnev Doctrine ( as shown in Czechoslovakia in 1968 ) ; subversive K.G.B . activities the world over , but notably in Ghana ( 1962-1966 ) and Mexico ( 1968-1971 ) ; the deplorable Soviet penal system and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as shown by Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn and Dr. Sakharov , to name but two ) , and the Soviet shipment of a nuclear warhead to the U.A.R. ( Egypt ) during the 1973 war . All of these events took place after Stalin 's death in 1953 . Mr. Chappell 's rhetoric is as bad as that of Messrs . Reagan and Rockefeller , whom he denounced in his letter for their rhetoric . Obviously the United States is not perfect ( nothing is ) , hot it is a far more democratic and peaceful nation than the Soviet Union . I suggest that Mr. Chappell do some research into post-Stalinist history before he ventures any more opinions . THOMAS JAMES MASTERSON ** Montvale , N.J. , May 31 , 1976 Jane Doe 's Abortion On May 14 , an article titled " There just was n't room in our lives now for another baby " by Jane Doe  --  the writer preferred a pseudonym  --  appeared on the Op-Ed page . The article , about her abortion to prevent having a fourth child , drew a number of readers ' replies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ e Editor : The piece by " Jane Doe " was a most objectionable contrivance . Jane Doe wanted to have her cake and eat it , tod , all under cover of anonymity . She wants to ignore contraceptive devices and yet not have to deal with abortion as a remedy for unplanned pregnancy . She wants to be a Friend of the Fetus and yet march for abortion rights . She wants to have the safety and civility of the abortion clinic she describes and still disparage its staff arid function . She wants to indulge in sentiment and yet be hard-nosed enough to know she prefers her career " in publishing " to that of the home and children . Most objectionably , she speaks from a position of privilege in which she can make choices and yet leave those who have n't that position feeling guilty or depraved . She is not to be believed . Who is she  --  a false front for some right-to-lifer ? No honest person writes such stuff . HELEN BAROLINI Ossining , N.Y . To the Editor : Let the haunting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the hearts and in the minds of those well-intentioned propagandists who so glibly pontificate that the human fetus is simply bodily tissue that can be excised at will . Pope Paul VI , in issuing his controversial encyclical Humanae Vitae on . ' July 25 , 1968 , correctly envisioned the depersonalization and dehumanization of the woman in a society where atiticonceptive and abortifacient practices become au courant when he stated that there would be a loss of respect for the woman and that there would no longer be concern " for her physical and psychological equilibribm . " Must every woman go through the indignity of contracting for and obtaining an abortion in order to understand and fully appreciate the import of the Pope 's perceptive guidance ? Be assured , Jane Doe 's haunting recollections are not atypical . As one who has had the opportunity to counsel those women who have had abortions , let me state : Jane Doe 's painful memoir says it all . The Rev. JOHN VIGILANTI St. Bartholomew 's Church Yonkers , N.Y . ? To the Editor : We are all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human depths which can be plumbed by the decision to abort a pregnancy . She has convinced me that the decision can rightfully be made only by the individuals involved . A woman who considers abortion ( and the man who continues to live with her ) leaves all known territories behind . Previously unconsidered questions force themselves into the open : What part of the whole scheme is this life on earth ? What am I that I can consider doing this ? What will I become if I actually do it ? ' Who could be so unspeakably arreigant as to answer for anyone but himself ? ALBERT E. TUCHER 3d Bridgewater , N.J. To the Editor : lane Doe forgot one thing in her article : How could a woman with three children and no intention of having more fail to use any contraceptive ? 1rd like that point explained before I am asked to join her in luxuriating in her regrets over a " very little ghost . " YADVIPA D. HALSEY Seattle 111 To the Editor : I , too , recently went through an abortion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the writer . And , in a manner similar to Jane Doe , I am a woman in her early 30 's , newly returned to her profession with two children reasonably autonomous . I think the women 's movement has done a disservice to women in whitewashing the emotional aspects of abortion . Jane Doe 's eloquent , very personal confessions of psychological pain , guilt and loneliness in an abortion may very well be universal . Of course , there is a continuum for these feelings . Many women may experience more relief than guilt , as the feminists claim . Still the powerful guilt and loneliness accompanying an abortion need to be recognized . NAME AND ADDRESS WITHHELD 111 To the Editor : I was one or the children that did not get aborted because my mother was too late to have a successful abortion . I was one of the children who were born despite my parents ' desire not to have any more children . And though there was never the abuse of which we hear so much , never the broken bones or the vicious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and crushing . I spent many years frightened and futilely trying to understand why my parents did n't care enough to discipline me . There was always food and a bed but no warmth or emotional support for years . No kind , wise mother to guide and encourage . Just emptiness and loneliness and bitterness . Only years later as I trained to try to cure lonely and desolate feelings in people such as I had been did I recognize the patterns of obsessive behavior which I showed . Years later I saw my overwhelming fear of sights and sounds of fury and abuse as evidence of the constant intense degree of anxiety which was my daily experience . I sometimes cry for the terrified little girl that I was . I 'm glad that my life as an adult did not include the dreadful decision that some women are called upon to make when the child within them is not wanted . I do not really know what that decision would have been . But I would gladly have sacrificed my feelinas as a mother rather than force another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did . CYNTHIA BOROFSKY , M.S.W. Nashua , N.H. To the Editor : Last week I had a wonderful experience . I had a T.O.P . ( Termination of Pregnancy ) . After my doctor confirmed my pregnancy , arrangements were made for me to enter a hospital . Upon . admission , I had a chest X-ray , blood tests , ECG and urinalysis , and my blood pressure was taken . The following morning I was taken to the operating room and given a general anesthetic . When I awoke I had excellent nursing and medical care . The following morning I went home . My husband picked me up at the hospital and the two of us walked out with smiles on our faces , knowing that we were not going to have a fourth child . That we loved our other three and could support them and send them VI college . The fourth we could n't . We made the right decision without any feelings of guilt . Perhaps if the author had taken the time to enter a hospital instead of deciding on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a wonderful feeling knowing that an unwanted pregnancy could be terminated . NAME WITHHELD Fort Lee , N.J. To the Editor : I suppose we 're to feel sympathy for Jane Doe who had an abortion even though she did not want one . I suppose also that our sympathy should stem from a purported insidious cavalier attitude toward child-bearing and abortion which , it is rumored , plagues us all . As a woman , however , I feel offended rather than sympathetic . Poor victimized Jane , indeed . Damn the clinic which served her . A husband who would n't pull her from the operating room . A marriage that exists more in delusion than in honesty . When does Jane start taking care of herself ? Is Jane really so stupid that , in spite of her ZPG buttons , she does n't know that in order not to have children , she had better use birth control ? I am sick . Sick of self-pitying stories by women who were never forced to have abortions . Sick of fanatic rightto-lifers who , in order to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make honest decisions . Luckily , most women are more responsible than Jane Doe . CATHERINE BARNETT Washington , D.C. Jane Doe replies : The varied reactions to my abortion article do not surprise me at all . They are all right . And they are all wrong . There is no issue so fundamental as the giving of life , or the cessation of it . These decisions ? are the most personal one can ever make and each person facing them reacts in her own way . It is not black-and-white as the laws governing abortion are forced to be . Rather it is the gray area whose core touches our definition of ourselves that produces " little ghosts " in some , and a sense of relief in others . I admire the woman who chose not to bear her fourth child because she and her husband could not afford to give that child the future they felt necessary . I admire the women who were outraged that I had failed to use any form of contraception . And I ache for the woman whose mother had given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and thus spent an empty , lonely childhood . It takes courage to take the life of someone else in your own hands , and even more courage to assume responsibility for your own . I had my abortion over two years ago . And I wrote about it shortly thereafter . It was only recently , however , that I decided to publish it . I felt it was important to share how one person 's abortion had affected her , rather than just sit by while the pro and con groups haggled over legislation . The effect has indeed been profound . Though my husband was very supportive of me , and I , I think , of him , our relationship slowly faltered . As our children are girls , my husband anguished at the possibility that I had been carrying a son . Just a case of male macho , many would argue . But still , that 's the way he feels and it is important . I hope we can get back on a loving track again . Needless to say , I have an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easily forgotten . I do not begrudge my husband his lack of contraception . Condoms are awkward . Neither do I feel he should have a vasectomy . It is profoundly difficult for him to face that he might never have that son . Nor do I regret having the abortion . I am just as much an avid supporter of children by choice as I ever was . . My . only regret is the sheer irresponsibility on my part to become pregnant in the first place . I pray to God that it will never happen again . But if it does , I will be equally thankful that the law provides women the dignity to choose whether to bring a new life into the world or not .
