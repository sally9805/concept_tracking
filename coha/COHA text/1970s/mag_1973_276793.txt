During seven weeks of debate , U.S. Ambassador John A. Scali maneuvered to keep an anti-Israel resolution from coming to a vote in the U.N . Security Council . Inspired by Egypt , the resolution in effect said that Israel 's continued occupation of the territories it had won in the Six-Day War was illegal . <P> Scali argued that passage of the resolution could only exacerbate Middle East tensions , since Israel clearly has no intention of giving up the territories without negotiations with the Arab states . Despite Scali 's efforts , the majority of the council last week endorsed the resolution-whereupon Scali vetoed it . It was only the fifth time in the U.N . ' s 27-year history that the U.S. Government had resorted to this ultimate weapon in the Security Council . <P> The draft resolution was supported by 13 of the council 's 15 members , including Britain and France , who buy the bulk of their oil from Arab states . China considered it too soft , and abstained . Scali rejected it as " highly partisan and unbalanced . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the one agreed basis on which a settlement in the Middle East could be constructed , " namely the 1967 U.N . Resolution 242 , which provides for Israel 's withdrawal linked to the establishment of " recognized and secure boundaries . " <P> Egyptian Foreign Minister Mohamed Hassan Zayyat , who led the drive to get the resolution to a vote , complained after the U.S. veto that " regardless of what you think is legal ... you will not be able to do anything because no matter what force you have , Israel will be put in a position to frustrate you " - which neatly summed up the stalemate .
