Cosmodromes on the barren steppes of Kazakhstan trembled with the thunder of departing rockets last week . An unmanned space vehicle named Salyut ( Salute ) roared off its launch pad and was sent into a near-earth orbit . It was followed four days later by a three-man crew in Soyuz ( Union ) 10 . As many as three additional Soyuz ships were reported poised to join the others in orbit . Ten years after Yuri Gagarin 's pioneering flight , the Soviet Union had seemingly begun its most ambitious venture into space : a long-expected attempt to assemble a manned station hi earth orbit . <P> The launch of Salyut-believed to be a cylindrical craft 60 ft. long , 30 ft. in diameter , and weighing as much as 50 tons-followed a week of rumors hi Moscow and a call at last month 's 24th Soviet Communist Party Congress for a " piloted orbiting station . " Hailed by headlines in Moscow newspapers , Salyut seemed clearly intended to function as the core unit of what Russian sources called an " orbiting shish kebab , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Switched Emphasis . Then , during the predawn hours Friday , Western radio telescopes picked up a second craft racing in pursuit of Salyut . Observers saw the two ships , shining as brightly as first-magnitude stars , crossing the night skies of northern Europe . Actually , Soyuz 10 was given a bigger boost than intended , and it arced into a 130-by 154-mile orbit , placing it above Salyut 's path . Observed Flight Commander Vladimir Shatalov , 43 : " Looks like you threw us up a bit too high . Well , it does n't matter , we 'll fix it . " By briefly firing Soyuz 's engine , the crew lowered the spacecraft 's orbit . At week 's end they had rendezvoused and docked successfully with Salyut for 5 hours . But then Soyuz undocked and returned its three-man crew safely to earth , inexplicably leaving the space station 's central unit , Salyut , alone hi orbit . <P> Since switching their emphasis to space stations-after it became obvious that the U.S. would be first to land men on the moon-the Russians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Said U.S.S.R. Academy of Sciences President Matislav Keldysh last month : " These stations will make it possible to engage in all-round investigation of the globe and the near-earth space in the interests of meteorology , geophysics , oceanology and other branches of knowledge . " Keldysh even mentioned plans to gather solar energy at such stations and beam it to earth for conversion to electrical power .
