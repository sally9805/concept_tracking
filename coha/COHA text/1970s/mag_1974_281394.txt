Like American pizza and French drugstores , the form and flavor of cultural phenomena often change in the translation from one country to another . So it would seem with television . Recently a pair of TV series have appeared , one in West Germany , the other in England , that present , in effect , foreign versions of two well-known American television families : <P> ONE HEART AND ONE SOUL . Hen Alfred Tetzlaff is the hero of West Germany 's hottest new situation comedy . He is a first cousin to both All in the Family 's Archie Bunker and his relative , Alf Garnett of the BBC comedy series Till Death Us Do Part . Herr Tetzlaff is a slobbish , slipper-shod metalworker . Married to an addled blonde whom he calls " dumb cow , " he has a jeans-wearing daughter and a liberal son-in-law . He deplores long hair , beards and miniskirts , surefire signs of Germany 's moral decline . He also dislikes almost everybody , especially foreign laborers , Slavs ( Russians ) and " Sozis " - socialists , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so familiar . <P> However , the German Bunker , says the show 's producer , Wolfgang Menge , is " more malicious , less human , more vulgar " than his American counterpart . The cocky , mustachioed Alfred was intended to be loathsome , and to impress his estimated 27 million viewers as such . Instead , his tirades have inspired a flood of laudatory mail : " Dear Herr Tetzlaff , you spoke right out of my heart , " or " Keep on ! You have millions of people on your side . " Archie Bunker , when he first appeared , got his share of similar support , but-in the eyes of a critical national and foreign press , at least-Archie 's popularity was not quite as frightening . But then Archie , unlike Alfred , did not remind anyone of Adolf . <P> THE FAMILY . The Wilkinses of Reading , England , are a British edition of the Louds of Santa Barbara , Calif . The BBC 's twelve-part prime-time show offers its audiences a fly-on-the-wall look at an ordinary family 's affairs similar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unlike the troubled Louds , the BBC 'S blue-collar Wilkinses are earthy , frank and seemingly stable . <P> Since the first episodes have been shown on the air before the final ones have been shot , not even the Wilkinses themselves know what will happen next . So far , the suspense has centered on the efforts of Mrs. Wilkins and Eldest Daughter Marian , 19 , to goad Marian 's boy friend Tom ( with whom she shares a room at the top of the family house ) into marriage . " He 's a bit thick , " says Marian of Tom . " He 's not thick , " counters her mother . " Otherwise you 'd already be married to him . "
